<P>
   BLACE, Macedonia _ More than 10,000 ethnic Albanians fled from
Kosovo into Macedonia overnight in the largest one-day exodus in
three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees reported that Yugoslav paramilitaries, some wearing
patches identifying them as members of a gang known as Arkan's
Tigers, are moving from neighborhood to neighborhood and
systematically emptying Pristina, the Kosovo capital, and its
suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Aid agencies crammed as many as 150 people in single tents and
requested emergency medical aid while struggling to deal with the
influx, which was continuing through the night.
</P>
<P>
   The rate of the expulsions raises the specter that Yugoslav
forces may be carrying out a final push to drive all ethnic
Albanians from Pristina, a city that once had a population of
250,000.
</P>
<P>
   The influx is also likely to raise tensions in Macedonia, which
struggles with its own ethnic splits and where the government
insists that more refugees must be evacuated to third countries,
like the Untied States. Monday night, officials of the U.N. high
commissioner for Refugees blocked an attempt by the Macedonian
government to bus 500 refugees directly from the border here to
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   One Pristina suburb, Vrjanjevac, was singled out for
particularly harsh treatment, refugees told aid workers. The suburb
is now full of refugees who fled from Drenica and Podujevo, Kosovo
Liberation Army strongholds, and they are being targeted for
retribution.
</P>
<P>
   Other neighborhoods are also experiencing terror. Armersh
Zhegrani, 23, said paramilitaries with Arkan's patches on their
uniforms separated him and seven male friends from their families.
He said two of them were killed when they failed to produce German
money that the paramilitaries demanded. ``If I didn't have 300
marks,'' he said, ``they would kill me too.''
</P>
<P>
   The paramilitary group is led by Zeljko Raznjatovic, known as
Arkan, who has been charged with war crimes in Bosnia and has been
accused of attacking ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Astrid van Genderenstort, a border monitor for the United
Nations, said a systematic pattern was emerging from refugees
arriving from Pristina, where expulsion of entire neighborhoods has
been reported for the last three to five days. ``It's door to door
again today,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, many refugees here, shivering in freezing rain,
struggled to choose their destination, under pressure to leave
their camps.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Zelije Hajdari, 75, decided last night that she did
not care where she went as long as the half dozen grandchildren
with her made it to shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Isa Hasani, 54, said that after his group crossed the border, a
Macedonian policeman told them that if they did not get on the bus
they might be pushed back into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   And Musa Tomgola, 59, said he was so disoriented and exhausted
that he did not know where he was going when he and his wife
climbed aboard.
</P>
<P>
   The three of them and 500 other Albanian refugees from Kosovo
were the focus of a surreal, midnight standoff Sunday when
officials from the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees blocked an attempt by Macedonian officials to send them
directly on to Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonian officials said the refugees had volunteered to go.
But some of the refugees themselves and officials of the refugee
agency said the refugees had been pressured into going or were
unaware of their intended destination. The standoff, which ended at
2:30 a.m. when the refugees were sent to a nearby camp, prompted
bitter recriminations Monday morning, and symbolized the rising
tensions here as the largest influx of refugees into Macedonia in
three weeks continued.
</P>
<P>
   For the third consecutive day, thousands of Albanians crossed
the border into Macedonia on Monday as Serbian forces continued a
new wave of mass expulsions from Pristina, Kosovo's provincial
capital, and towns across southeastern Kosovo. More than 20,000
refugees have arrived in Macedonia in the past three days, 6,000 of
them on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The new arrivals have increased the sense of uneasiness in a
small country of 2 million people where long-running tensions
between the Slav majority and Albanian minority have been
exacerbated by the arrival of more than 240,000 Albanian refugees
from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Macedonians, Slavs who generally sympathize with the
Serbian effort to hold onto the Kosovo province, fear that if the
influx continues, they may find themselves in the minority here.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, local Albanians _ up to one-third of the
country's population _ are angered by what human rights activists
say is the government's latest heavy-handed effort to contain the
number of Albanian refugees here by shipping some of them to
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Arben Xhefari, a member of the country's fragile coalition
government and the leader of Macedonia's major Albanian party, said
Monday that he was still investigating what occurred Sunday night
and Monday morning, but he warned that all movements of refugees
from Macedonia must be voluntary. ``This is a principle of
international law,'' he said. ``You cannot deport the deportees
again.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue is expected to continue to arise. If the influx of
refugees continues at the same rate, refugee camps here will be
filled to capacity on Wednesday, refugee agency officials said.
</P>
<P>
   This morning, after the standoff ended, Boris Trajkovski,
Macedonia's deputy foreign minister, asked NATO countries to back
the plan to ease the pressure by offering refugees who arrived at
the border the opportunity to be sent to Albania immediately.
</P>
<P>
   But officials of the refugee agency and human rights activists
cited the procedures Sunday night as an example of how such an
approach was ripe for abuse. Benjamin Ward, a researcher for Human
Rights Watch, said that international law guaranteed refugees safe
haven and warned that frightened, exhausted refugees could be
easily pressured into allowing themselves to be sent on to Albania.
``Refugees who in some cases have been on the road for days and
weeks, who are physically exhausted and psychologically frail are
in no state to make a free choice about matters that could affect
their lives for months,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the refugees, the dispute causes further agony. Ms. Hajdari,
who spent 12 hours waiting on the border with her grandchildren,
said her family had spent three weeks living off bread and salt in
the woods. One of the young children with her showed signs of
severe hunger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people were crying and screaming and it was cold,'' she
said of the scene at the border. ``I ran from the Serbs and I came
here and I didn't get anything. There has to be an open door for us
somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats here, eager to keep Macedonia stable, played
down the dispute. American and European diplomats have generally
followed a course of trying to be supportive to the fragile
Macedonian government, arguing that attacking the Macedonians could
alienate them and further destabilize the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's kind of getting into the minutiae,'' said a
Western diplomat, referring to the dispute. ``The larger issue is
that the people are getting out of Kosovo and getting refuge.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the mistrust of Macedonian intentions stems from an
incident in early April, shortly after the NATO bombing brought the
first wave of Kosovo Albanians over the border. On that occasion,
Macedonian police, again working in the dead of night, rousted
thousands of Albanians and shipped most to other camps across
Macedonia, and several hundred to Albania and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the U.N. refugee agency also accused Macedonian
police of pushing 1,000 refugees back into Kosovo under cover of
darkness on May 5, the height of the last large refugee influx.
Macedonian officials vehemently denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday night's incident, five buses arrived at the border
crossing here. Refugee agency officials said they initially assumed
the buses would carry some of the 3,000 to 4,000 refugees waiting
to be processed by Macedonian border guards to refugee camps in
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   But Macedonian police loaded the buses and told the refugee
agency the refugees had volunteered to go directly to Albania.
Because they had not been told of the plan in advance and had not
interviewed the refugees themselves, the refugee agency officials
used another vehicle to block the convoy. They also called
reporters and at one point even considered forming a human chain to
block the buses.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis McNamara, the refugee agency's special envoy to the
region, arrived at the scene and angrily accused the Macedonian
government of breaking repeated promises to keep the border open.
</P>
<P>
   After negotiations, Macedonian officials bused the 500 people to
the nearby Brazda refugee camp at 2:30 a.m. The remaining refugees,
numbering several thousand, were finally placed in a transit camp
just over the border here, said Astrid van Genderen Stort, a
refugee agency border monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Trajkovski, the Macedonian official, said all of the refugees
wanted to go to Albania and refugee agency officials agreed that
some, in fact did. He added that the plan to bus people to Albania
was first suggested by NATO countries when the overcrowded camps
were near the breaking point during the earlier influx.
</P>
<P>
   Refugee camps have been built in southern Albania to house
refugees from Macedonia, but only 260 refugees have voluntarily
gone there. Many stay in Macedonia because they have an opportunity
to move to Western Europe and the United States from here. In
Albania, they do not.
</P>
<P>
   Trajkovski complained that NATO countries were not keeping their
promise to evacuate more of the refugees and help Macedonia's
collapsing economy.

DESPITE NATO EFFORTS, MILOSEVIC KEEPS HIS FLOW OF OIL AND
CASH  (ART ADV: Map is being sent to NYT graphic clients.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As part of the campaign against President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia, the Clinton administration and NATO have
tried to cut off his oil supply and his bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   It is a campaign that has not gone well, American and NATO
officials say. Barges are filled with oil in Ukrainian ports and
cross the Black Sea to chug up the Danube River through Bulgaria
and Romania. To pay for it, Milosevic is using money he secreted in
banks in Cyprus during the earlier period of sanctions against
Yugoslavia, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration and European governments have appealed to
Ukraine to shut down the trade and they have asked Cyprus to freeze
Milosevic's bank accounts, American and NATO officials say, but to
no avail.
</P>
<P>
   During his visit to Washington last week, Gen. Wesley Clark,
NATO's commander, raised alarms about the oil shipments traveling
up the Danube and said that action needed to be taken to stop them.
He said this route was increasingly being used because NATO had
been somewhat successful in choking off the supply coming into
Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   American officials say that they do not have a good fix on the
volume of oil Milosevic is getting through this route _ he is still
getting some from ships unloading at Montenegrin ports _ but they
say that it is Russian oil. The deals are being arranged by
middlemen who are making a tremendous profit because of the risks
involved, the officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how much oil Milosevic was getting, one administration
official said, ``All he needs.'' Another official said that was an
exaggeration, but he conceded that the Serbian leader was getting
enough oil to keep his military machine going. A third official
replied, simply, ``Too much.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and NATO have tried to deal with the
matter quietly, fearing that making it a public issue could
backfire.
</P>
<P>
   When an oil embargo was last in effect against Yugoslavia, from
1992 until the signing of the Dayton peace accords in 1995,
Bulgaria and Romania were major conduits for oil in violation of
the sanctions. (Greek and Italian oil companies were major
suppliers, with most of their oil moving through Albania, a route
that has now been largely shut down.)
</P>
<P>
   But Washington and European capitals expect to have more success
now. The governments in Bulgaria and Romania have become more
stable and have better-trained law enforcement agencies; above all,
they have moved from their Communist pasts, expressing a strong
desire to get into NATO and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bulgaria and Romania have not been as cooperative as the
administration would like.
</P>
<P>
   The governments argue that they cannot interfere with traffic on
the Danube because it is an international waterway covered by the
Danube Convention of 1948, which calls for free movement of ships.
But American officials dismiss those assertions, noting that the
convention was signed by the Danube riparian states when they were
part of the Soviet bloc; West Germany was the one Danube state that
did not sign.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, American and NATO officials say, the major problem is
Ukraine, which is the source of the oil transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Last week during meetings in Brussels, Belgium, Boris Tarasyuk,
Ukraine's foreign minister, was cordially but firmly told that his
country must stop the barges from loading up with oil in the
Ukrainian ports, a NATO official said.
</P>
<P>
   Tarasyuk countered with complaints about the economic damage
Ukraine was suffering because of the war against Yugoslavia. He
said that it had cost his country $220 million in lost trade, that
Ukrainian ports alone had lost $12 million, and that a Danube
shipping company in Ukraine was losing $313,000 a day. Who was
going to compensate Ukraine for that, he demanded of the NATO
diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and NATO are not confident that they
will prevail upon the Ukrainian government. Nearly 90 percent of
the Ukrainian population is against the NATO bombing, according to
recent polls there, an American official said. It is for this same
reason that the administration does not feel that it can make a
public issue out of Ukraine's lack of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   In Cyprus, too, the Clinton administration is worried about
upsetting the government and so has not said anything publicly, but
it is not happy that the Cypriots have refused to close the bank
accounts belonging to Milosevic and to the Yugoslav government.
</P>
<P>
   With its secretive banking laws, Cyprus has become a major
money-laundering center, especially for Russian organized criminal
operations, American and European law-enforcement officials say.
European law enforcement officials say that many of the continent's
cigarette-smuggling operations use Cyprus, including an operation
in which one of Milosevic's sons is involved.
</P>
<P>
   American officials say they do not know how much Milosevic has
in these accounts, in part because finding his assets had never
been a priority of the CIA, several officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But however much is in them, the Cypriots argue that there is no
basis for seizing the bank accounts because there are no United
Nations sanctions against Yugoslavia. Most of the sanctions against
Yugoslavia that were imposed in 1992 were lifted after the Dayton
peace accords in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But back when the sanctions were in effect, Cyprus did not
cooperate either.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always found loopholes,'' an American official said.

NEW YORK COACH HAS SUPPORT _ OF FANS
</HEADLINE>
 BKN-HAWKS-KNICKS-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By Bob Ryan 
c.1999 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ You know what they say. Well, maybe you don't know
what they say, so allow me to tell you.
</P>
<P>
   What they say in this business is ``Hang around long enough, and
you'll see everything.''
</P>
<P>
   That probably needs an amendment. How about, ``Hang around long
enough, and you will see something you've never seen before''?
We'll leave out the ``everything'' part.
</P>
<P>
   I've been hanging around the NBA 30 years, and Monday night I
encountered two firsts: 1. Before the game a team CEO apologized to
the media for lying; 2. A crowd at Madison Square Garden chanted
lovingly for a coach who eight days before had his immediate future
decided by a lucky bounce.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yeah. In between, there was a basketball game. The Knicks
leveled the Atlanta Hawks by a 79-66 score. (Trust me when I say
the margin felt more like a hundred thirteen.) With that win the
Knicks completed their first four-game series sweep since 1969. And
with that win the Knicks will be meeting the Indiana Pacers for the
Eastern Conference championship in a series that will begin at 5:30
p.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The game was a perfunctory exercise. The Hawks would have been
better advised to send a letter of concession. But the pre- and
postgame stuff was definitely intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   The evening began with Madison Square Garden president and
acting Knicks general manager Dave Checketts addressing the media
on the subject of published reports that before the regular season
was completed, he had interviewed Phil Jackson for the Knicks'
coaching job currently held by Jeff Van Gundy, a story Checketts
had denied when first asked about it. A day later he did
acknowledge, through a public relations spokesman, that contact
indeed had been made with Jackson through an intermediary. It was
further revealed that he also had talked with Turner Broadcasting
analyst Doc Rivers, as well as Dave Cowens, who needs no
introduction.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night he admitted half the truth. He admitted that he had
lied to both the media and, more importantly, to Van Gundy. He also
acknowledged that he had spoken to Jackson directly for two hours,
and not solely to an intermediary. So he lied twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did it to protect the best interests of all concerned,'' he
explained. ``It was obvious that there were people who knew about
the meeting and were looking to make us squirm. I know where those
leaks are, and we'll be careful in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't sound very contrite to me. Yeah, I lied to you guys
and to my coach. But you gotta do what you gotta do. And, hey, this
wouldn't be a problem if someone hadn't leaked it out.
</P>
<P>
   It's not like anyone in the media should be offended. Club
officials and coaches lie or distort the truth or otherwise mislead
us and, by extension, you all the time. As Checketts said, it's in
their best interests. We're engaged in a constant cat-and-mouse
game with them. This is why no member of the media should ever get
too righteous about being lied to. It's seldom personal. It comes
with the territory.
</P>
<P>
   Part B came with about 3 1/2 minutes remaining. The Knicks were
in complete control, as they had been since the middle of the first
period. It was deep into garbage time. And then it started. ``JEFF
VAN GUNDY! JEFF VAN GUNDY!'' The capacity crowd of 19,763 was
reverently chanting the beleagured mentor's name. Many of them
arose for the proverbial Standing O.
</P>
<P>
   ``A New York first,'' observed a man who safely can be described
as a ``veteran New York scribe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard, `Joe Must Go!' and `Goodbye Allie,' but in all my
years I've never heard a crowd chanting for a New York coach.''
</P>
<P>
   No one understands the fickle nature of the crowd, or the
contextual relevance of all this, more than Van Gundy, son of a
basketball lifer who has become one himself. He wasn't going to get
carried away with this.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Jeff Van Gundy,' '' he repeated. ``I kept waiting for the
next word _ `sucks.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That said, he expressed his gratitude. ``That was nice of 'em,''
he said. ``I really appreciated it.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how much he appreciated the personal apology he got from
his boss for lying to him two days earlier is another matter. ``We
had a meeting,'' he acknowledged. ``What was said will stay between
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed to explain just how it is that he has been able to
retain his sanity in the midst of some truly amazing public
scrutiny, Van Gundy took a deep breath. ``I don't know,'' he
sighed. ``If you got me behind a closed door, you'd probably say,
`This guy is a lunatic.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that there isn't a coach in the league with a
better sense of who he is _ or isn't _ than Jeff Van Gundy. He
regards himself as a very fortunate fellow just to have this job.
Think about it. In the next series he will be going up against a
certified basketball legend. He is a former Division 3 point guard
who started out coaching high school and who has done every dirty
little task a coach has to do. Every day he spends at this job is a
bonus. He always feels he's on borrowed time. In that sense, Dave
Checketts can't hurt him.
</P>
<P>
   His job security? ``It's a dead issue, a non-issue,'' he
insisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a long time ago about team sports that the most
important thing is to keep the focus on the team and nothing
else,'' he explained. ``So over the next five days the only thing
I'm worried about is preparing this team to play Indiana. It's not
about me. It's about the team. I'm going to do my best to get this
team ready.''
</P>
<P>
   I believe him. What really matters is that 12 guys wearing
Knicks uniforms believe him, too.

<P>
   PHOENIX - Keith Tkachuk didn't want to talk about possible
candidates for the Phoenix Coyotes vacant head coaching job Monday,
or the qualities he would like to see in his new boss.
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk liked the old boss, Jim Schoenfeld, just fine, and he
wanted to pay homage to him first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I just want to talk about Shoney,'' Tkachuk said
Monday from his home in the Boston area. ``Today is Shoney's day.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a day Schoenfeld could have done without, since he was
fired after two seasons with the Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   The move surprised Tkachuk, the Coyotes' captain, who was
informed of the decision by a phone call Monday morning from
General Manager Bobby Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``It caught me by surprise,'' Tkachuk said, ``especially when,
as a team, you made a lot of strides.''
</P>
<P>
   But people will remember this season for the step the Coyotes
didn't take. They lost in the first round of the playoffs for the
eighth straight time, including each of Schoenfeld's two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld had at least two things working in his favor: a
regular season in which the team finished with 90 points, the
second highest total in franchise history, and a locker room full
of players who wanted him back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate he had to be the fall guy for our team not
being successful,'' said Tkachuk. ``You ask any player in that
dressing room, and they'll say Shoney is a great and approachable
guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He helped me tremendously in becoming a better person on and
off the ice. If we weren't going well, in the locker room he was
hard on me, which helped me a lot. He would ask for your opinion .
. . listen to you and talk to you about everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Teppo Numminen, a defenseman, also was surprised by the move.
``I thought Shoney would be our coach next year,'' he said. ``But
that's not the way Bobby (Smith) thought. He wanted to change, and
that's the way it is. Bobby's in charge.''
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk said Schoenfeld's firing was the nature of hockey, where
there is little job security.
</P>
<P>
   ``You play to be traded and are hired to be fired sometimes,''
Tkachuk said.
</P>
<P>
   Center Jeremy Roenick echoed Numminen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a cutthroat job,'' he said. ``Players lose their jobs,
coaches lose their jobs, and GMs lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys got along with Shoney and liked him, but
unfortunately whether you like somebody or not doesn't win hockey
games. (Schoenfeld) can take solace in the fact that he worked his
(expletive) off and did what he had to do for the Phoenix
Coyotes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes went 35-35-12 in 1997-98, Schoenfeld's first season,
but lost in the first round to Detroit, which went on to win the
Stanley Cup. This season, the Coyotes went 39-31-12 and lost in
seven games to St. Louis in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Like Tkachuk, Roenick thought the Coyotes improved this season.
But success is coming in increments that are too small, Roenick
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we can take steps as slowly as we're taking
them,'' he said. ``We have to jump start it and move quicker.''
</P>
<P>
   Roenick said he would like to see the team hire an
offensive-minded coach with a creative mind.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I'm an offensive-minded guy,'' he said, ``and we need
it. Let the goaltenders do their jobs. Let the defensemen do their
jobs and the forwards do their jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes' new coach will be the team's third since moving to
Phoenix in 1996. But coming off another first-round loss, it's not
like Schoenfeld's firing means a dynasty is being torn apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Losing in the first round put a damper on things,'' Roenick
said. ``Yeah, we're starting over with a new coach and a new
system. But we're professionals, and we should be able to grasp it
pretty quickly.''

HOLMES TO GET INJECTION FOR BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX -Once  &UR; Darren Holmes' back discomfort has been taken
care of, he'll be back in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   There is a strong likelihood that Holmes will receive an
epidural injection today to alleviate the pain in his lower back
that has been bothering him for about two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks trainer  &UR; Paul Lessard refers to it as a ``nerve
impingement.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmes had a similar problem with the New York Yankees last
season and had an epidural, but he said the pain is not nearly what
it was then.
</P>
<P>
   ``That time, I couldn't even pitch. At least now, I can throw.''
</P>
<P>
   After today, Holmes probably won't be ready to pitch until
Sunday at the earliest. By then, the club will be on another trip
that will take it to New York and Montreal. &QL; 
Honoring victims &QL; 
While the Diamondbacks were in Denver over the weekend for their
series with the Colorado Rockies, Holmes met with a few of the
students who were shot at Columbine High School on April 20. He
pitched for the Rockies for five seasons and lived near Littleton,
site of the shootings. Manager  &UR; Buck &UR; Showalter met with the
school's principal before Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes also gathered up a bunch of Diamondbacks caps and had his
teammates sign them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys on our club were concerned about them and praying for
them,'' he said. ``I thought it would be a nice gesture to show the
kids and that community that our team and the people of Arizona
have them in our thoughts.'' &QL; 
Restless soul &QL; 
Don't give right-hander  &UR; Todd Stottlemyre any coffee _ he already
is bouncing off the walls as he begins his shoulder rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not the most patient patient,'' Lessard said. ``The thing
we have to be careful about is that when he starts feeling good,
he's going to want to do more, like pick up a ball and throw it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre probably won't be able to do that for about four
weeks. On Sunday, Lessard said he began range-of-motion exercises,
which gave Stottlemyre more motivation. &QL; 
Miller on a roll &QL; 
Catcher  &UR; Damian Miller, who has been battling soreness and
stiffness in his left Achilles', likely will be back in the lineup
tonight.
</P>
<P>
   He is having his best season in the majors, hitting .343 with
four homers, 20 RBIs and nine doubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting to play at least four or five times a week lends
itself to consistency,'' said Miller, who usually alternates with
 &UR; Kelly Stinnett. ``You get into a groove and you fight to get to
the bat rack.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller says the Achilles' affects him more when he runs. One way
to alleviate that would be to hit the ball out of the park so he
could jog around the bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish it was that easy,'' Miller said. &QL;

WITH PROSPECTS LIMITED, SUNS SHIP 16TH PICK TO BULLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - After looking over the list of players likely to be
available in the middle of the June 30 NBA draft, the Suns elected
Monday to convey the 16th pick to the Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction completes the sign-and-trade deal the Suns
negotiated last summer with the Bulls for center Luc Longley. The
Suns still hold the ninth pick of the first round, which they
obtained from Dallas in a trade for Steve Nash on draft day last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns now will retain its 2001 first-round pick, which would
have gone to Chicago had the Suns elected to keep the 16th pick
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at a situation where we have to ask whether the
player we get at 16 is going to be able to beat out the player we
get at No. 9 or Pat Garrity for playing time,'' Suns General
Manager Bryan Colangelo said. ``When we assess the depth of the
draft, the player at 16 is probably going to struggle to find time
with this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo said the Suns had considered the possibility of using
the pick in combination with the No. 9 pick to move up in the
draft. But they determined that the 16th choice doesn't have much
trade value, and other clubs are in a better position to deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think it has great value to other teams,'' Colangelo
said. ``And there are two teams, Atlanta with four picks and Utah
with three, which have much more flexibility than we have in terms
of packaging picks. We don't have as much leverage as those teams,
and that's all part of the decision-making process.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suns sent forwards Mark Bryant, Martin Muursepp and Bubba
Wells, along with the conditional first-round pick, to Chicago for
Longley shortly after the NBA lockout ended. Longley had signed a
six-year contract with the Bulls as part of the sign-and-trade
deal. Only Bryant played with the Bulls last season. Muursepp and
Wells were released.

ORLANDO MAY EYE SKILES  
 SUNS ASSISTANT IS CANDIDATE TO SUC CEED DALY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Almost immediately after Orlando Coach Chuck Daly
announced his retirement Monday, Suns assistant Scott Skiles
emerged as a leading candidate for the plum job that Daly leaves
vacant.
</P>
<P>
   Skiles, 35, was one of the most popular players in the Orlando
franchise's history, playing there from 1989-94. He is the club's
all-time assists leader and set an NBA record in 1990, handing out
30 assists in a game against Denver.
</P>
<P>
   NBA sources said that the Magic, anticipating that Daly might
step down, had made preliminary contact with Skiles and other
potential candidates to determine whether they have interest in the
job.
</P>
<P>
   Skiles, who still owns a home in Orlando, confirmed that he has
interest in the position but would not comment on whether he
expects to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't want to say anything about it right now,''
Skiles said Monday by telephone from Indiana. ``We'll just have to
wait and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Agent Keith Glass, who represented Skiles as a player and now as
a coach, said the Magic organization has kept close tabs on its
former point guard, but the club hasn't officially requested an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talk to the Magic all the time about various things, and
Scott's name always comes up in those conversations,'' Glass said.
``But there hasn't been anything official from them at this point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, when the time is right, we'd love to talk to them
about it. The whole league is aware that he's going to be a head
coach at some point, and probably a terrific one with time. And
obviously, his name is going to come up in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   ``Including Shaq (O'Neal) and Penny (Hardaway), I'm not sure
there has ever been a more popular player with the fans in Orlando
than Scott.''
</P>
<P>
   Skiles has spent the past two seasons as an assistant to Suns
Coach Danny Ainge and was regarded as a potential head coach even
before joining the Suns staff.
</P>
<P>
   His star began to rise when Skiles took over the Greek
professional club PAOK, a perennial European power that was
foundering, at midseason in 1997. Skiles led PAOK into the European
Cup playoffs, then turned down a lucrative contract from that club
to join the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix General Manager Bryan Colangelo said Monday that he had
not been contacted by the Magic.
</P>
<P>
   Skiles emerged as a candidate for several NBA head coaching
positions last summer but only agreed to one formal interview _
with the Chicago Bulls. Chicago hired Tim Floyd, who had long been
rumored as the replacement for Phil Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   As a player, Skiles once teamed with Orlando stars Hardaway and
O'Neal. Skiles was traded to the Washington Bullets (now the
Wizards) because the Magic wanted to free salary-cap space to sign
forward Horace Grant and management was convinced Hardaway would
become the team's point guard.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway started this season as the club's point guard but made
it known throughout the season that he prefers to play off the
ball. Eventually, Darrell Armstrong took over at point guard and
the Magic finished as the No. 3 seed in the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   But following a first-round elimination by the Philadelphia
76ers, speculation was that Daly, 68, might leave. Hardaway's
future also is up in the air. He has an early-termination clause in
his contract and is seeking a new seven-year, $85 million contract
from the Magic.
</P>
<P>
   Other potential candidates for the Orlando job include Turner
Sports broadcaster Doc Rivers, former Charlotte Coach Dave Cowens
and Orlando's executive vice president, Julius Erving. &QL;

DEVILS SNUBBED BY NCAA 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Arizona State baseball Coach Pat Murphy may have
wanted to scream, he may have wanted to cry.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he tried to joke about something he does not find at
all funny: another snub by the NCAA selection committee _ the third
in five years for an ASU bubble team and the fifth in 10 years for
Murphy as a coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's best for Arizona State that I'm not around, maybe I
should not sign my new deal (with the school),'' Murphy said.
``Maybe they (the NCAA) are trying to run me out of college
baseball. I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's their goal, if that's what is best for Arizona
State, then let's do it. I can find another job. I would probably
make a good policeman.''
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, Murphy would like to police the NCAA
selection committee, which is a nine-member panel comprised of
coaches and athletic directors.
</P>
<P>
   Two of his Notre Dame teams, each with at least 45 victories,
were not selected.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils, last year's national runner-up and ranked in the
Top 10 by ``Baseball America'' for most of the season, did not make
this year's field, even though it was expanded to 64 teams. They
finished 39-21 overall.
</P>
<P>
   ASU also was not selected in 1995 (34-21 record) and 1996
(35-21). That's three snubs in the past five years for the Sun
Devils under Murphy after they made a tournament trip routine under
the late Jim Brock.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to look at who else has been left out five of the
last 10 years,'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing tied for fifth in the Pac-10 and a questionable
non-conference schedule were deciding factors in ASU's exclusion,
according to selection committee chairman Dick Rockwell.
</P>
<P>
   ``ASU was a .500 team (in the Pac-10), and we didn't want to go
that deep into the conference,'' Rockwell said. ``We felt that four
teams were a fair amount from the Pac-10.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford, USC, Arizona and UCLA made the field. The Bruins
received a bid despite having a 30-29 overall record. But they did
sweep three games from ASU and tied for third in the conference
with Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ASU tied with Washington at 12-12 record in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona defeated ASU, 6-2, in the last game of the season,
likely sealing the fate for both teams.
</P>
<P>
   ASU's Andrew Beinbrink, who attended a somber meeting with
teammates at a Tempe sports bar to watch the selection show,
believes the telling blow was the grand slam by Arizona's Keoni
DeRenne in the eighth inning of the final game of a three-game
series last week.
</P>
<P>
   UA won two out of three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Murphy) told us we had to win two out of three in that series
to have a good shot,'' Beinbrink said. ``Anytime you leave it up to
the committee, you're rolling the dice.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell said UCLA had been a tough call.
</P>
<P>
   ``The committee was mixed on UCLA; it took an hour and a half to
decide,'' Rockwell said. ``We came to the determination that UCLA
played everybody. They played 21 teams in the top 50.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils had a 1-9 record against the top 50 teams in the
NCAA's Ratings Percentage Index, according to Rockwell. They were
swept by Florida State and Stanford. They lost a game at Cal
State-Fullertion, and they lost two of three to USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm being honest with you _ ASU was down a few more spots than
No. 65 (in the ratings),` Rockwell said. ``You have to go much
deeper than 65.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Florida State and Cal State-Fullerton, ASU's
non-conference schedule included Utah, Hawaii-Hilo, Howard, New
Mexico, Brigham Young, Oklahoma, Boston College, Grand Canyon and
Southern Utah.
</P>
<P>
   None qualified for the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Beinbrink said ASU's appearance in the championship game last
year should have carried some weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've showed that when it comes to postseason play, we play
our best baseball,'' he said. ``That shows the strength of the
program.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rockwell said, ``The selection is a year-to-year process. We
don't look at history.''

COYOTES MIGHT NOT HAVE FAR TO LOOK FOR A RE PLACEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - So where do the Coyotes turn now in their search for a
new head coach?
</P>
<P>
   According to General Manager Bobby Smith, who fired Coach Jim
Schoenfeld on Monday, he probably won't look beyond a short list of
more than four to six candidates. Perhaps even fewer.
</P>
<P>
   And one of them is Coyotes assistant coach John Tortorella,
whose contract expires June 30, but who was named a ``serious
candidate'' for the job by Smith on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely. I've known John for two years now, and yeah, he
will get a chance to get interviewed for the job,'' Smith said. ``.
. . John will be a serious candidate and I'll gauge his interest in
remaining with the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Tortorella, 41, is seen as a hot coaching prospect in the NHL,
with other potential job opportunities reportedly in such cities as
New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   But he is not alone on the list of potential prospects being
considered by Smith, who just completed his third season in an NHL
front office.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of other well-known names immediately surfaced after
Schoenfeld's dismissal, among them, former NHL head coaches Mike
Keenan, Ted Nolan and Larry Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have a great deal of interest in the job, but that's
certainly up to Bobby,'' said Keenan, who has taken three teams to
the Stanley Cup Finals _ the Philadelphia Flyers, the Chicago
Blackhawks and the New York Rangers, whom he helped guide to the
championship in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``He interviewed me before the job went to Jimmy . . . but I'm
familiar with some of the very important people on that hockey
club. I've worked with a few of them successfully in the past, and
for that reason, I'm ``definitely'' interested in them, their
ability and the entire team. I'd certainly like another opportunity
to coach in the NHL.''
</P>
<P>
   Keenan, fired at the All-Star break as head coach of the
Vancouver Canucks, has previously coached the Coyotes' Rick Tocchet
in Philadelphia and Jeremy Roenick in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan won NHL Coach of the Year honors two seasons ago after
leading the Buffalo Sabres to a 40-30-12 record, but he was
relieved of his duties that summer in a management shake-up. He
recently interviewed with the Los Angeles Kings, however, about the
vacant head coaching position there after Robinson was fired last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a teammate of Robinson's in Montreal for several seasons,
initially said Monday that both Keenan and Nolan were not
considered serious candidates to replace Schoenfeld. However,
during a radio interview later in the day on KGME-AM (550) Smith
said, ``I haven't ruled out anybody or any type of person.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a 15-year NHL player who won the Calder Trophy as the
NHL's Rookie of the Year in 1979 with Minnesota, did rule out
himself as a possible replacement. ``Absolutely not,'' he said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has talked at least two to three times in the past few
weeks with Robinson, though, who had coached the Kings since
1995-96. Smith would not comment on those conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Other possible candidates include Detroit Red Wings assistants
Barry Smith and Dave Lewis. Smith was among the finalists for the
job before Schoenfeld was hired. Another possibility, though a long
shot, might be veteran NHL Coach Jacques Demers. Though currently
the GM/Coach of the Tampa Bay Lightning, word is circulating that
new ownership will replace him in both capacities. Demers, however,
has three years remaining on a deal that reportedly will pay him
$800,000 annually.
</P>
<P>
   There also was some speculation late Monday that Detroit Coach
Scotty Bowman, 65, the NHL's all-time winningest head coach, might
be interested in a change of scenery after six seasons with the Red
Wings. Bowman, however, is expected to retire this summer and it is
doubtful he would consider a short-term move to Phoenix. &QL;

TKACHUK ALLIANCE WAS FATAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - There was the power play that Jim Schoenfeld couldn't
fix. And the one he couldn't win.
</P>
<P>
   Take a guess which one cost him his job.
</P>
<P>
   There was the coach who catered to Keith Tkachuk and the 1-0
victory. And the owner who wants the emphasis on sizzle, scoring
and Jeremy Roenick.
</P>
<P>
   Take a guess who prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Coyotes General Manager Bobby Smith announced the
firing of his second head coach in three years. He wore a sense of
resignation, as if this were an unforeseen consequence. And he
claimed it was his call all along, a decision he didn't reach until
a disastrous meeting with Schoenfeld last week.
</P>
<P>
   In their little chat, Smith said he wanted to change the style
of Coyotes' hockey. He insisted on handing all the power-play
authority to another coach. He coyly pierced Schoenfeld's bloated
sense of stubbornness and pride, and in doing so, forced him out
the door.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Schoenfeld saw the torpedo coming, the one he had feared
all along.
</P>
<P>
   The one fired by Richard Burke.
</P>
<P>
   Really, is this any surprise?
</P>
<P>
   It is striking how Smith still feigns bewilderment over
Schoenfeld's alleged paranoia. How all the rumors over shaky job
status and postseason edicts lived only in Schoenfeld's head. Look,
the former coach may not have been a great coach, but Schoenfeld is
a very bright man. He knew all along whom he was fighting. Knew all
along he was not the owner's guy.
</P>
<P>
   But from the moment Schoenfeld arrived in the Valley, he aligned
himself with Tkachuk. He made Roenick compromise his free-wheeling
style of play. He put all his money on one horse, and when that
horse failed to reach the second round of the playoffs, it was
over.
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld gambled, and Schoen feld lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``A new coach is in order if we are to improve,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that Tkachuk matured greatly under
Schoenfeld's wing, but two years later, the Coyotes remain
strangely disjointed. Not exactly the closest group in the NHL, and
for all the good things he accomplished, this is Schoenfeld's
greatest error. By catering to one man, he lost the rest of the
dressing room very early in his tenure. And by sitting on Roenick _
who just happens to be Burke's neighbor _ he punched his own ticket
to the television booth.
</P>
<P>
   So they're starting over, and unless Scotty Bowman suddenly
wants to coach in Arizona, there is not an abundance of big-name
coaches looking for work. And remember, the future of the Coyotes
still rests on popular opinion.
</P>
<P>
   A great option would be Mike Keenan, who is definitely
interested and vowing to play nice. He has coached Roenick and Rick
Tocchet, and both players remained fiercely loyal to the Keenan
Way. He is a brilliant bench coach. And with another stadium vote
upcoming, Keenan would be a lightning rod for interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm biased, but I love the guy,'' Tocchet said. ``I really
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Problem is there are too many ex-coaches on payroll, and Keenan
wouldn't come cheap. Problem is, Smith wants no part of Keenan and
officially shot him off the wish list on Tuesday. Problem is, the
successor is starting to smell preordained, a job greased for
assistant coach John Tortorella.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can be one of the best hockey minds around,'' Roenick said.
``He's got the X's and O's, the personality, the ability to kick
someone in the (expletive). He was the brains behind our
operation.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, the era of Jim Schoenfeld ends with a thud.
</P>
<P>
   There was the night when he was so close, when ``his guy''
almost saved the future. The night when Tkachuk's series-clinching
goal was stopped just before crossing the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   And there was the night when the other guy became a local hero,
when Roenick insisted on playing with a shattered jaw. A night when
Schoenfeld's future was sealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time now for a team that's more creative, more daring,''
Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   With more Roenick and less Tkachuk. With the emphasis on one
team, not one man.
</P>
<P>
   A team the owner wants and a team the ex-coach could never
produce. &QL;

LACK OF SCORING COSTS SCHOENFELD HIS JOB 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Jim Schoenfeld was half right.
</P>
<P>
   After predicting the Coyotes would win Game 7 of their playoff
series against the St. Louis Blues, and then tying the outcome to
his future as the team's head coach, Schoenfeld was fired on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The end came three weeks after the franchise suffered a
first-round exit for the eighth time in its past eight trips to the
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Citing a clash of opinions and Schoenfeld's refusal to take a
proactive stance on suggested changes involving the coaching staff
and its style, General Manager Bobby Smith terminated the veteran
coach with one year left on his contract.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he had been all but set to announce Schoenfeld would
be returning for a third season behind the bench. But recent
discussions with the coach about the direction the team was
heading, specifically after a lengthy meeting on Thursday, changed
everything.
</P>
<P>
   According to Smith, it hinged on Schoenfeld's apparent refusal
to alter his coaching style and philosophies, something Smith told
``The Republic'' a little more than a week ago he didn't foresee
would be any problem at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt comfortable that he could,'' said Smith, who wants to
see a more creative and daring approach on offense. ``We talked at
length about changing the cast of characters around Jim and
bringing in expertise (assistant coaching) on the power play and
the creative part of our game, and that, in a large part, was the
reason why we're not on the same page and the reason for the
disagreements we've had.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had come to the decision within the past 20 days that Jim
Schoenfeld would be the coach next year. I told him, `Let's talk
about it. Let's talk about the changes in your style, the coaching
staff and your own approach that will allow us to be successful.'
But really, we couldn't overcome that and here is where we are
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld, who at one point this past season was the leading
candidate to win the Jack Adams Award as the NHL's Coach of the
Year, becomes the team's third head coach to be fired since the
club's final season as the Winnipeg Jets in 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld, 45, who previously coached the Buffalo Sabres, New
Jersey Devils and Washington Capitals, compiled a 74-66-24 record
in two seasons with Phoenix. This past season, he guided the
Coyotes to a 90-point season (39-31-12), the club's second-best
regular-season finish in its 20-year history. The club also set
records for fewest goals-against (197), going 10-0-1 in the month
of November, and holding the opposition to two or fewer goals for
17 straight games, the NHL's third-longest streak since 1943-44.
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld, who has refused repeated interview requests by
``The'' ``Republic'' since the season ended, was informed of the
decision Monday morning by Smith. Schoenfeld couldn't be reached
for comment again on Monday, but he issued the following statement
through the team:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a situation where three people _ myself, Bobby
Smith and (Owner) Richard Burke _ are looking at the forward
direction of the hockey club and seeing it in a different way. I am
grateful to Bobby Smith for giving me the responsibility of
coaching the team and grateful for the tremendous support I
received from the entire Coyotes staff.''
</P>
<P>
   He then added a note of praise to his players, most of whom
lobbied for his return, saying, ``A special thanks to my players
who played with all the heart and determination a coach could ask
for. Good luck and keep growing.''
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes captain Keith Tkachuk said Smith called him Monday
morning to tell him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised; he caught me off guard,'' Tkachuk said.
``Usually when coaches get fired, there are rumors leading up to
it. Shoney is a great person and a great coach so I was upset when
I found out.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the year we really made great steps to become a better
hockey team. I'm going to miss him tremendously.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes must pay Schoenfeld's $400,000 salary for next year,
unless he finds an NHL head coaching job elsewhere. If he takes an
assistant coaching position, a settlement would have to be
negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes assistant John Tortorella, who spent six seasons as an
assistant coach with the Sabres and coached their farm club, the
Rochester Americans, to the American Hockey League championship in
'96, is a ``serious candidate'' for the job, Smith said. His
contract expires on June 30, but he will be granted an interview
for the job within the next two weeks, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Tortorella also has not returned repeated messages.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant coach Gordie Roberts, who also doubles as the club's
director of player development, will be assigned to the latter role
exclusively and his contract, which also was set to expire, will be
extended. &QL;

 &HT;    Left-hander surrenders 8 runs in 21/3 innings (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Stan Williams stood above the spray-painted home
plate down the right-field foul line at the Metrodome Monday, and
was impressed with what he saw go by. Jeff Fassero's fastball was
live, his slider was breaking right and his splitter was just as it
should be.
</P>
<P>
   When the Mariners pitching coach came back to the dugout, he
told manager Lou Piniella that Fassero, who had dominated the
Minnesota Twins last week, was looking good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was expecting a good game out of him, I really was,''
Piniella said. ``He threw eight shutout innings last week against
the Twins and made it look relatively easy. Today, it was a totally
different result. I don't have an explanation for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassero gave up eight runs in 21/3 innings Monday night as the
M's fell, 10-5, before 12,101 fans. He surrendered two home runs,
pushing his major league-leading total to 17, and nine hits, tying
him with Greg Maddux for the major league lead at 88.
</P>
<P>
   The left-hander's record dropped to 2-6.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hit it up the middle,'' Fassero said. ``If I played with
five infielders up the middle, I'd probably be better off. That's
where basically all their hits went, except for the two home runs
and the one down the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Five Minnesota singles were hit up the middle, and one went to
right-center. Torii Hunter hit a double down the right-field line,
and Ron Coomer and Chad Allen powered homers to left.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero had success last week by pitching inside, and tried the
same approach this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went inside early and wasn't getting strikes in there,''
Fassero said. ``So we went away from that a little bit, and they
went up the middle. Give them credit. It's a game of adjustments.
(Catcher) Dan (Wilson) and I tried to make some, and it just didn't
work out the right way. You've got to give them credit for what
they did.''
</P>
<P>
   What they did, Hunter said, was make a conscious effort to not
try and pull Fassero's splitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to go up the middle,'' said the Twins' center
fielder. ``With his splitter, we knew we had to stay on that pitch,
go up the middle or the other way. We tried to do that up there,
but he kind of dominated us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners scored twice in the first inning off Dan Perkins,
whom they scored seven runs last week. Ken Griffey Jr. extended his
career-best hitting streak to 13 games with a double that brought
in Brian Hunter, and Edgar Martinez scored Alex Rodriguez with a
ground out.
</P>
<P>
   But Minnesota took the lead in its half of the inning, on a
single _ up the middle _ by former Mariner Brent Gates and a
two-run homer by Coomer. Three singles and a fly ball produced two
runs in the second, and Allen's three-run homer knocked Fassero out
in the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a stupid pitch to Coomer,'' Fassero said. ``Basically,
they were both stupid pitches. With Coomer, I got it in, just not
in deep enough. He was cheating there, and a sinker away or
something off-speed might have gotten a ground ball. Allen, we made
look stupid on a slider prior to the one he hit. I looked at the
home run (on tape), and I couldn't have put it in a better
location. It was just that he was looking for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassero said he's taking some comfort in knowing he's not the
only pitcher around baseball giving up home runs. What bothers him
most, he said, is that so many of the homers have come with men on
base. Of the last seven homers Fassero has allowed, only one has
been solo, and 17 runners have scored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them have been in situations where I'm behind in the
count, not wanting to walk a guy,'' he said. ``The sad thing about
what's happened is that middle infielders, small guys, are hitting
balls out of the park. It's not just me, it's all over the league.
I'm sure I'm leading the league, but there are quite a few guys
who've given up 13, 14, 10. Home runs are up all over the league.
The only thing you've got to do is make sure nobody's on base.
Unfortunately, that hasn't been the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Perkins won his first major league game, despite allowing a
homer in the third to former Westminster Christian (Miami) High
School teammate, Rodriguez. The rookie allowed three runs on seven
hits in 62/3 innings, and four relievers finished off the M's.
</P>
<P>
   Former Mariner Bob Wells started the ninth with two quick outs
before Rodriguez singled, his fourth time on base in five at-bats.
Griffey came up next, fell behind 0-and-2 and fouled off three
pitches. Wells threw two balls, then Griffey rocketed his 17th
homer over the high wall in right field.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just said, `Here, hit it,''' Griffey said of Wells.
</P>
<P>
   As for the hitting streak, in which he's hitting .423
(22-for-52) with six homers and 15 runs batted in, Griffey said it
doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't worry about it,'' he said. ``We lost. That's all I
really worry about.''

NFL SUITOR BROAD WAIVES EXCLUSIVITY
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ATLANTA _ If Michael Ovitz was going for the pizazz and Eli
Broad the pragmatic in their competing proposals before the NFL
expansion committee on Monday night, Broad at least opened with a
surprise:
</P>
<P>
   His group waived the two-year exclusivity agreement Ed Roski Jr.
had obtained from the Los Angeles Coliseum Commission for
renovating the stadium and owning a Coliseum team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to get this on the merit or we're not going to get
it,'' Broad said. ``We think we have the merit, we think we have
the best ownership group, the right political support, the right
work up to date. We said let the chips fall where they may, and we
think they ought to fall in our direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday marked the first time the expansion committee got a look
at Ovitz's new plans for rebuilding the Coliseum, and they came
away impressed with his proposals for the stadium and parking.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz, who had previously wowed the team owners with his flashy
plans for a hacienda-style stadium in Carson, proposed a
68,000-seat design that is expandable to 92,000 for Super Bowls. It
includes seven parking structures that would house 27,000 spaces in
a parklike setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very impressive,'' said Jerry Richardson, the Carolina
owner and head of the NFL expansion committee. ``It was
extraordinary. It's a park, the design, the architectural elements
_ it's extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz, however, has had only six weeks to switch his plans from
Carson after owners selected the Coliseum as the Los Angeles
stadium site and has not had time to meet with the various agencies
that control Exposition Park for input.
</P>
<P>
   Broad stressed his group has put in more than two years on the
Coliseum site, had relationships with all the area agencies and was
the only one with a practical plan.
</P>
<P>
   Broad said he continually told owners they needed to proceed
with ``due diligence'' and not be taken in by glitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I don't want to be negative, but I hope you choose a
plan that is not only dazzling, but is also feasible and will get
built,'' Broad said. ``We believe our plan is the only one you're
going to see this evening that's not only spectacular but has the
necessary approvals and will actually get built.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said what I don't want to see happen is three months from
now or six months from now, the league gets frustrated by
everything that was promised that can't happen, and you take the
whole operation to Houston or another site.
</P>
<P>
   ``They knew this was not flimflam, this was the real thing and
an honest presentation.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee did not endorse either plan Monday night, but
Richardson said it is expected to meet once or twice more before
the three-day owners meetings conclude.
</P>
<P>
   Both groups said they would give their plans to the NFL and city
of Los Angeles, regardless of whether they were selected to own the
league's 32nd franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``That both parties addressed the parking in a substantial way,
both parties were willing to share their plans with the other if
the other was selected, which was extraordinary in my judgment, and
the exclusivity issue has been withdrawn, that's all significant,''
Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   Broad implied Ovitz's plan was not workable, particularly the
seven parking structures, and continually stressed that it was his
group that had the necessary relationships with the involved
political groups.
</P>
<P>
   But Richardson said because of the short time Ovitz had to put
his plan together, it was not reasonable to expect he would be able
to get input from all involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ovitz group has only developed this concept in the last
several weeks,'' Richardson said. ``The assumption is, they will be
given a fair hearing to whatever the ruling bodies are,
particularly if it enhances that park, that section of Los Angeles
in a significant way. And if it is done, I think it would be
extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz, the former superagent with deep Hollywood connections,
believed his proposal had impressed the owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were asked to make a plan that included 25,000 parking
spaces and to make the Coliseum an area that would have great
potential for a positive fan experience,'' Ovitz said. ``We
delivered a plan that has in excess of 27,000 parking spaces, that
has a 60-acre park that stays there to be used by the inner city
365 days a year, less than nine football games.''
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz, however, stressed he would need public support for the
estimated $225 million needed for parking.
</P>
<P>
   Roski returned from a vacation in Nepal on Monday and did not
attend the meetings, which were originally scheduled to start
today.

WOMEN'S WORLD CUP ASPIRES FOR ATTENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the NBA lockout was resolved and the league's schedule
makers decided the finals would be contested in July, women's
sports and soccer fans flinched.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since 1996, when the United States was awarded the 1999
Women's World Cup, the 16-country tournament has been set for
action across the nation, from June 19 to the championship match in
Los Angeles on July 10.
</P>
<P>
   But wouldn't you know it. A basketball labor dispute messes
things up.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of an open sporting slate in which the United State's
Mia Hamm, Michelle Akers and Julie Foudy could shine, instead of
exploring subplots from top teams from China, Norway and Germany,
mainstream sports fans get another chance to satisfy their athletic
cravings from the NBA trough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our preference is to have had the calendar to ourselves, but
when you look, you see there is hardly a time when you wouldn't
have something competing with us,'' Women's World Cup president
Marla Messing said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Women's World Cup might catch a break, though. The way
things are going, the Indiana Pacers could be playing the San
Antonio Spurs or Portland Trail Blazers in the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Such a battle of TV mini-markets would all but ensure that NBC's
ratings for the first NBA championship in these post-Jordan days
will be in the dumper.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe NBC would like to reconsider its position.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, when the U.S. women won the gold medal at a packed
stadium in Georgia, the Summer Olympics network allotted barely 10
minutes of coverage to the dramatic match _ a foul of
triple-yellow-card proportions.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that is part of the reason ESPN and ABC decided to lock up
the entire Women's World Cup, committing to televising all 32
matches, start to finish.
</P>
<P>
   The risk is significant for a TV venture of this sort, even with
several games relegated to ESPN2.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer watching in America rates somewhere behind Robbie Knievel
daredevil stunts and Triple Crown horse racing.
</P>
<P>
   But the point for ESPN might have been to make sure that if
indeed the American appetite for the Women's World Cup is
sufficiently whetted, the cameras will be there, rolling.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Risser, ESPN vice president of programming, said Monday,
``Our coverage of the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup is part of our
ongoing commitment to present the biggest soccer events in the
United States to the viewers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Women's World Cup is only in its third cycle (1991 and '95
were the first two) and doesn't have the history of the men's World
Cup, which started in 1930.
</P>
<P>
   World Cup organizers are praying this is the breakthrough event
for women's soccer, if not worldwide then at least in this country.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the sporting public's awareness of the World Cup seems
vague. Messing asserted again Monday that the major thrust for
ticket sales has been through the soccer community, with single
ticket sales starting one month ago.
</P>
<P>
   That has pushed total ticket sales to about 380,000, with most
sales being at sites where the U.S. team will play.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, World Cup organizers started advertising in
major daily newspapers in Portland, Chicago, New York, the San
Francisco Bay Area, Washington D.C., Los Angeles and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   With the campaign in those venue cities, Messing said they are
projecting ticket sales to reach 500,000. That is far below the
men's World Cup, which sold out every game. But it is enough to
help Women's World Cup organizers ensure they can call this the
largest women's sporting event.
</P>
<P>
   As for concerns that ESPN is lagging in promoting the
tournament, Messing said World Cup officials are not concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think with TV, proximity to the event is crucial,'' she
said. ``I don't think they do a lot of advance promotion because
that's not what their viewers are geared for.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday night, amid the NBA, baseball and hockey
highlights, ESPN's Sports Center broke the Big Three's stranglehold
on sports coverage when it broadcast highlights of U.S. national
team star Mia Hamm's record-setting goal.
</P>
<P>
   By scoring her 108th international goal, Hamm broke the world
record held by Italy's Elisabetta Vignotto.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone who has seen Hamm and the marvelous U.S. team compete
in the Olympics, during international matches or exhibition
friendlies, there is little doubt that this is one of the most
compelling sports teams ever to play _ and to do it for so long.
</P>
<P>
   Six players, including Seattle's Michelle Akers, are playing in
their third World Cup. Their skill level, tenacity and hunger are
for real.
</P>
<P>
   The Hamm highlight the other night was an advance shimmer of the
kind of excitement this World Cup could inspire _ especially in the
later rounds, when the elite teams from the United States, China,
Norway and Sweden are left to display their superlative talents.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there is just a lot of waiting and wondering to be done.
What impact the tournament will have on women's soccer on a
national and world level remains to be seen, but the test is almost
upon us.

exposed deep fissures in the gun lobby. Mounting tensions between
the National Rifle Association and the nation's largest gun makers
have weakened the NRA's political clout in Washington, helping gun
control advocates score several victories in the Senate last week
with the passage of the first gun control measures since the

flashes of gamma radiation, known as gamma ray bursts, seem to be
cosmic birth announcements of a phenomenon of awesome power, one
predicted by Einstein's general theory of relativity but shrouded
in mystery because no light can escape the dark clutches of its
consuming gravity. If current hypotheses are correct, Dr. Tsvi
Piran of Columbia University said at a recent four-day symposium at
the Space Telescope Science Institute, ``each gamma ray burst is
signaling the creation of a new black hole.'' By John Noble

   SCI-WEIGHT-FAT (Undated) _ For three decades now, Americans have
been bombarded with advice to eat less fat for the sake of their
hearts and their waistlines. But now a growing number of nutrition,
health and obesity specialists maintain that in trying to squeeze
some of the heart-damaging grease from our high-fat diets, they
have sent Americans the wrong message. It's not fat per se that's
the problem, the experts now say, but the kinds of fats Americans
eat and the other kinds of foods they fill up on when they cut back
on appetite-satisfying fat. By Jane E. Brody.

Federal review board illuminates the increasing stresses on that
hospital and university review boards face and the new

the safety and efficacy of experiments on humans, generally work on
their own time with little or no staff and virtually no training.

   SCI-SMALLPOX (Undated) _ The Doctor's World: Smallpox, an
ancient disease, was eradicated 20 years ago. Smallpox, the virus,
is on death row, frozen in two highly protected laboratories in the
United States and Russia. Like lawyers filing last minute briefs,
American scientists recently found new arguments for public health
research requiring use of the virus in future laboratory
experiments. Last week, with the U.S. and Russia reversing earlier
decisions to destroy the smallpox virus, the World Health
Organization granted the virus yet another stay. It is good for at
least three years beyond the June 30 date that had been set for its
destruction in ovens. By Lawrence K. Altman
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FLAG-PRESERVE (Undated) _ Using technology as new as space
age fabrics and as ordinary as the chemicals from the corner
dry-cleaning shop, scientists and historians here have taken on the
job of cleaning and preserving the Star-Spangled Banner, the flag
that flew over Fort McHenry in Baltimore in 1814, so that it might

machine shows users what they might look like if they lost 15
percent of their weight or, show a 30 percent gain. Then it tells

maladies _ heart disease, diabetes and high blood pressure _ worsen
and improve with the changes. By Eric Nagourney. (425 words)

   SCI-ONLINE-FITNESS (Undated) _ On-line training: The Internet is
awash with gymnasts and fitness competitors, body builders, coaches
and trainers willing to sign up clients for online fitness. The
system has its advantages, including the anonymity. This writer
emerged 17 pounds lighter, capable of sleeping through the night
for the first time in her life, energetic, fit and strong. By
Marion Roach.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Personal Health: In the early '70s,
celebrity dieters and wishful thinkers propelled Dr. Robert C.
Atkins's self-styled ``diet revolution'' into a national phenomenon
that sent shivers of despair through the promoters of sound
nutrition and public health. Despite warnings of a possible heart
attack on every page, ``Dr. Atkins' Diet Revolution,'' a book that
promoted a high-fat, high-protein diet and spurned all
carbohydrates, was bought by 10 million Americans whose growing
reliance on labor-saving devices and fast foods had spawned thunder
thighs and rendered their waistlines obsolete. But the Atkins
scheme was neither new nor revolutionary then and is really no
different from his ``new diet revolution,'' published in 1992 and
now enjoying a resurgence of popularity among countless
weight-conscious women and carnivorous men seeking a quick and
painless route to a slimmer summer. By Jane E. Brody.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WEIGHT-PILLS (Undated) _ In their eagerness to take pills
that will help them slim down, people may conveniently overlook
something that doctors remember all too well: weight-loss drugs
have had an alarming history. By Denise Grady.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WEIGHT-REBOUND (Undated) _ It is a depressing article of
faith among the overweight and the professionals who treat them
that 95 percent of people who lose weight regain it _ and sometimes
more _ within a few months or years. That statistic has been quoted
widely over the last four decades, from Congressional hearings to
diet books to research papers and seminars. And it is the reason so
many people approach dieting with a sense of hopelessness. But
there is a problem with that piece of conventional wisdom: There is
no scientific basis for it. In fact, obesity researchers say that
no one has an accurate idea of what percentage of the population
can maintain a weight loss over the long term. By Jane Fritsch.

DINING ALFRESCO? RECONSIDER 'FRISCO
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  LAST CALL: Looking for a place to take a nice quiet midnight
walk? Try North Beach, San Francisco's newest graveyard.
<P>
   Fortunately, the death might be only temporary.
</P>
<P>
   It got mighty quiet last weekend when cops shut down the
normally lively sidewalk cafe action a couple hours early and gave
notice that the change would be permanent. Panic set in among
restaurant owners and patrons.
</P>
<P>
   The cops from Central Station rolled up the sidewalk cafes at
midnight Friday and Saturday. Normally the cafes serve food until 2
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The cops seemed to be sending a message: Serve a ravioli, go to
jail. Or something like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's horrible,'' says Cassitta Massimo, manager of Figaro, one
of several restaurants that feature sidewalk tables. ``They
basically killed the atmosphere of North Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   Are we looking at the Des &QL; 
Moines-ization of San Francisco?
</P>
<P>
   Will newspaper headlines scream: ``A Great City Forced to Go
Home Early''?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not. Now the police at Central are backpedaling a bit, and
the death of North Beach cafe nightlife might be exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   Several owners say the police came around last week with a
warning, then came back Friday and Saturday night, telling
restaurant workers and patrons there would be no liquor allowed on
the outside tables after 11:30 and the tables had to be taken
inside by midnight, or else everyone would turn into a pumpkin.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our officers told them that, the officers were wrong,''
says Lieutenant Tom Del Torre. ``We'll send our permit officer
around next week (to go over the ground rules with restaurant
owners).''
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen North Beach restaurants are licensed by the state
Alcoholic Beverage Commission to serve liquor outside until
midnight, and the outdoor food licenses, issued by the city's
Department of Public Works, have no curfew.
</P>
<P>
   So why the weekend crackdown? Well, Central is instituting a new
zero-tolerance-for-bad-stuff policy.
</P>
<P>
   While over-revved and sometimes under-aged young folks flocking
to North Beach's strip clubs and Broadway bars are a growing police
problem, it's hard to see how cracking down on 1 a.m. diners
enjoying a last cup of sidewalk gelato would ease the crime
problem.
</P>
<P>
   John Konstin, owner of John's Grill downtown, took his staff to
Calzone's in North Beach last Saturday night for their regular
decompression session, and they were informed that they'd have to
lose the booze at their sidewalk table by 11:30 and lose themselves
by midnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were police everywhere,'' Konstin says. ``It was like
the National Guard had been called out. The police were coming
around giving warnings. `You've got 15 minutes.'''
</P>
<P>
   Wow, and this is in the heart of the regular stomping grounds of
On-Da-Town Willie Brown. This kind of thing could hurt San
Francisco's rep as a big-time nightlife city. You can get a
sidewalk snack later than midnight at Disneyland.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Astabie, manager of Calzone's, tells me the police came
around last week to warn that there would be a weekend crackdown,
and the fine for non-cooperation could be up to $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's the ordinance, they've never enforced it before,''
Astabie says.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. John Goldberg of Central Station says no restaurants or
customers were cited, but ``we're starting to ask for compliance
(with the midnight liquor cutoff). ... The purpose (of the outdoor
tables) is so people can enjoy a meal outside in the ambience of
North Beach. It is not an extension of the bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have enough problems with alcohol establishments, and if
you put the alcohol outdoors (late at night), the bar loses a
tremendous amount of control over the customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, as it gets later, diners have gone home, it's just the
drinkers out. And as much as this is an area for tourists and
diners, it's also a residential area.''
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant people say their late-night wine-and-diners
aren't a nuisance.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Friday and Saturday our kitchen is open 'til midnight, and
we get a fair amount of late diners from `Beach Blanket Babylon,'
'' says Chris Patterson, chef de cuisine at Tavolino (Italian for
``little table'').
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Goldberg says sidewalk noise is a problem for some
residents.
</P>
<P>
   But one North Beach insider points out that any resident who
lives close enough to a restaurant to be disturbed by midnight
diners was probably high on something when he or she bought/rented
his or her place. You don't move into the heart of North Beach for
tranquility and quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is happy, but for now, still alive on the sidewalks
of North Beach: The legal midnight snack.

 (Editors: Fixes `Cowan' to `Conway' throughout)   Duffield Hands Over Operation of PeopleSoft 
 &HT;       
 By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Former Oracle Corp. executive Craig Conway officially took over
yesterday as president and chief operating officer of PeopleSoft
Inc., the once high-flying business software firm that has stumbled
in the past year.
<P>
   Conway, 44, assumes day-to-day management of the Pleasanton firm
from founder and chief executive David Duffield, who said Conway
could succeed him in that position ``in the next six to 12
months.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Conway said his immediate challenge is to steer
PeopleSoft past its current troubles, including a drop in corporate
software orders and a turnover in top leadership, and to refocus on
growth markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``One strategic challenge is (to find) the single opportunity
that the company can devote itself to in order to reach the next
level,'' Conway said. ``As the old saying goes, if you go hunting
two rabbits at the same time, then probably both will get away.''
</P>
<P>
   Conway, 44, moves to PeopleSoft at a time when the second
biggest maker of business management software tries to recover from
a downturn that has caused its revenue growth to plummet from as
high as 80 percent to only 10 percent in the most recent quarter.
In January, the company announced it was laying off about 400
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in PeopleSoft fell from a high of $52.13 in July 1998 to
as low as $11.50 in April. Conway's appointment was announced
before the stock market opened Monday, but PeopleSoft shares rose
only 50 cents, to $16.69.
</P>
<P>
   PeopleSoft and its major competitors, Oracle and SAP AG, have
been hurt by a slump in business software sales in Asia and Latin
America. In addition, the Y2K problem has caused many corporate
technology managers to halt new spending until after the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Conway said PeopleSoft also suffered from the turnover in senior
management, especially when Chief Financial Officer Ronald Codd
resigned in January to head another company and Albert Duffield,
brother of David Duffield, retired as senior vice president of
sales and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   That left David Duffield at the top, but ``as Dave will tell
you, he's maybe world-class establishing corporate culture, but
he's not the best at managing day-to-day operations,'' Conway said.
</P>
<P>
   Conway said he did not have any immediate changes planned
because he wants to take time to inventory the company's strengths
and weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   He said that PeopleSoft, which first rocketed to success by
selling human resource management software to the largest Fortune
500 corporations, must now focus on selling business applications
to mid-sized corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Conway spent eight years at Oracle, where he was executive vice
president for marketing. That included a period in the early 1990s
when Oracle ``stumbled very &LR;   &LR; badly,'' a situation that he said was
comparable to the one PeopleSoft is facing now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a sense we could overcome almost any obstacle by
outselling it,'' Conway said. ``You almost get lulled into a false
sense of security. PeopleSoft has been able to go so long without
hitting any obstacles. It led a charmed existence. But nobody keeps
60 to 80 percent growth up forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Conway was most recently president and CEO of OneTouch Systems
Inc. of San Jose, which was bought by Hughes Network Systems and
the Apollo Group. Before that, he was CEO of TGV Software Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``What attracted me was that (PeopleSoft) was a company with an
incredible franchise in the high-tech industry,'' Conway said.
``Notwithstanding the tactical issues it faces this year, there's a
huge future win here.''
</P>
<P>
   Other moves will probably include acquisitions, perhaps in the
area of software automating sales force management.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stay tuned, in fact, within the next few weeks,'' Duffield
said. PeopleSoft has already signed partnerships in the past year
with customer relationship management software leader Siebel
Systems Inc. and Vantive Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Duffield, 58, will remain chairman. ``I'll die here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said PeopleSoft must focus more on Internet products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, they have to roll out the most compelling electronic
commerce and Internet-enabled products as fast as they can and
leverage their existing user base effectively and quickly,'' said
Robert Austrian, a software analyst at NationsBanc Montgomery
Securities in San Francisco.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL SULLIVAN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
DALLAS _ They tried everything _ slap shots, wristers, wraparounds
and tips _ and time and again the puck either bounced away
harmlessly or disappeared into glove or pads.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Patrick Roy was at it again Monday night, and the Dallas Stars'
inability to solve the riddle in the Colorado Avalanche goal left
the President's Trophy winners on the brink of a second straight
home defeat in the NHL Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   What to do in such a dire situation?
</P>
<P>
   Try, try again.
</P>
<P>
   Shot No. 44 of a grind-it-out evening at Reunion Arena
eventually would make all the difference. It came when Joe
Nieuwendyk poked in a rebound at 11:52 of the third period, and it
proved to be the game-winner as the Stars outlasted the Avalanche
4-2 to even the series at a game apiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those rare times when you were all alone in
front of the net,'' Nieuwendyk said. ``Our persistence paid off. I
thought we wanted it more than they did tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Game 3 is Wednesday night at Denver's McNichols Arena. And
rather than facing a sweep, Dallas served notice that it may be
ready to make some noise in this series after all.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Roy did his best to discourage such thinking. Through
more than 2{ periods, he stopped 41 of 43 shots, almost
single-handedly keeping his team in a game the rest of the
Avalanche didn't seem to feel all that strongly about winning.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Nieuwendyk got position in front of the net. And when
Roy couldn't handle Pat Verbeek's shot cleanly, Nieuwendyk was
there to cash in on the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have much choice but to keep firing the puck,'' he
said. ``Patrick's been in a bit of a zone, the last week to 10
days, and we really had to get second and third opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Verbeek's role in the game-winner was fitting, too. About five
minutes earlier, he battled in front of the net and coaxed a shot
past Roy, but the goal was waved off when it was determined that
Verbeek had a skate in the crease at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt we'd played a good game, but he was still tied,''
Verbeek said. ``We just dug a little deeper.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado coach Bob Hartley could not say the same of his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played,'' he said of the winners. ``We didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Other events, however, were eerily reminiscent of Game 1, as a
disallowed goal once again appeared to energize the team that lost
the argument. Two nights earlier, the Avalanche had gained momentum
when an apparent goal was waved off after some poorly placed
padding kept the puck from completely crossing the line.
</P>
<P>
   This time, it was Dallas' turn to vent some frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the Stars break through on Nieuwendyk's score, but
they added that rarity of rarities _ a power-play goal _ to provide
some insurance. Mike Modano got it on a feed from Sergei Zubov at
16:28, giving Dallas its first goal with a man advantage in seven
tries on the night, and just its sixth in 61 postseason chances.
</P>
<P>
   Chalk this one up to perseverance, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we just played desperate,'' coach Ken Hitchcock said.
``We know where we're at. If it's 0-2, we're in big trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played this game as a sudden-death game, and that's why we
won it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it would not be easy.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado scored first when Sandis Ozolinsh poked in a rebound of
a Claude Lemieux shot at 10:32 of the opening period. It was the
earliest an opponent had scored against Dallas in 12 postseason
games, and it came on a power play, ending the Stars' run of 14
consecutive successful kills.
</P>
<P>
   The lead didn't last long. Just when Roy was looking
impenetrable, Dave Reid shook off Warren Rychel long enough to get
off a shot that beat the Avalanche goalie high and to Roy's right,
tying the game at 14:11.
</P>
<P>
   Reid was forced to take more ice time after Benoit Hogue
suffered a season-ending torn knee ligament.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas goalie Ed Belfour (19 shots, 17 saves) was by no means as
busy as Roy (45 shots, 41 saves), but Belfour had his moments. His
best came when he maintained the tie with a brilliant sliding save
on Milan Hejduk about four minutes into the second period.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars came right back at the other end as Zubov got off a
blast on a drop pass from Modano and beat Roy low and to the
goalie's right, making it 2-1 Dallas at 4:56.
</P>
<P>
   Again, though, the Stars could not extend the advantage, and
Hejduk eventually shoveled a rebound past Belfour at 14:59 to tie
the game again.
</P>
<P>
   The final 20 minutes would be almost all Stars. Dallas outshot
the Avalanche 15-1 in the period and kept plugging away until Roy
finally surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' reward for that effort: new life as the series shifts
to Colorado.

 By DALE ROBERTSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
EXACTLY half, and specifically the left half, of the Astros'
starting lineup has gone DL. While that's better than AWOL, I
guess, this is not a situation to be taken lightly.
<TEXT>
<P>
   No matter how deep you are, you don't lose your third baseman,
left fielder, shortstop and projected starting catcher and not feel
a tad nervousy _ particularly when the first two on the
aforementioned snakebit list were supposed to be the Nos. 4 and 5
hitters in the batting order.
</P>
<P>
   Cleanup man Ken Caminiti, of course, became the latest lineup
scratch after pulling a calf muscle in San Francisco on Friday
night, thereby joining Moises Alou, Ricky Gutierrez and Mitch
Meluskey on what we sportswriters call ``the shelf.'' Good thing
the Astros, still somehow clinging to the best record in the
National League, have managed to build a modest cushion for
themselves entering a period in which they figure to, tops, tread
water.
</P>
<P>
   Another good thing: Excepting reliever Doug Henry, none of their
pitchers is hurt. Yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``As thin as our pitching staff is,'' general manager Gerry
Hunsicker said, ``that would be critical, a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker was the National League's Executive of the Year for
1998 mostly because of the trade that made Randy Johnson a smashing
rent-an-ace for the last two months of the season. But he deserves
at least as much credit for less flamboyantly putting together a
roster perhaps capable of withstanding the kind of blows the Astros
have incurred since Alou began the parade of calamities over the
offseason by tearing an anterior cruciate ligament when he tumbled
off an exercise treadmill.
</P>
<P>
   Best case, Alou returns in late August. Meluskey, the would-be
heir apparent to traded catcher Brad Ausmus, is lost for the year
after shoulder surgery. Cammy? He's gone for 15 days minimum and
could miss as much as a month, considering the troublesome nature
of his kind of malady, never mind the ever-fragile condition of his
ridden-hard, put-away-wet 36-year-old body.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Gutierrez, however, was throwing batting practice
Monday and should be taking BP himself by the end of the week,
barring any setbacks. Fortunately, there's no great need to rush
Ricky's return, thanks to Tim Bogar's excellent work in the role of
understudy.
</P>
<P>
   Bogey, in fact, seems downright disinclined to give Gutierrez
his job back, never mind Ricky's .357 average when he got plunked
on the back of his left hand April 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might have a decision to make there,'' Hunsicker admitted.
</P>
<P>
   It's hoped the committee assigned to cover third in Caminiti's
absence _ Monday's starter Russ Johnson, Billy Spiers and,
occasionally, Jack Howell _ can behave in a similar
finders-keepers, losers-weepers fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cammy will return to the lineup when he's ready
regardless of what they accomplish as a tag team, the trio should
be up to the task of at least maintaining an even keel. Caminiti
hadn't set that sizzling a pace after all, hitting for a decent
average (.292) but struggling to drive his buddies across the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   His total of 17 RBIs pales in comparison with Jeff Bagwell's 45.
Then again, perhaps that's the problem. Baggy, who bats directly
ahead of him, has been leaving hardly any R's for Cammy to BI. He's
on a club-record-wrecking pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, you worry about run production,'' Hunsicker said.
``Who's going to drive them in? We can't ask Baggy to do it by
himself. Losing Cammy on top of Alou is a blow.''
</P>
<P>
   God forbid that the Killer B's _ plus the Killer E, center
fielder Carl Everett _ should begin going down as well. Among them,
the lads on the intact right side of the lineup have accounted for
well over half of the Astros' ribbies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at our limit,'' manager Larry Dierker said. ``We can't
afford any more injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Which explains why he made a beeline to second base to inspect
Richard Hidalgo, who appeared to have hurt himself on a
seventh-inning double but stayed in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker sees a positive in the collective negative to date,
nonetheless. Everett and Hidalgo, Alou's replacement, are receiving
the every-day ABs they need, and he believes Caminiti will actually
profit from his latest forced respite.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a sore ankle that wasn't healing, and his back was
bothering him,'' Dierker said. ``He didn't come out of spring
training ready to play (because of a sinus infection). Maybe he'll
come back more ready than he was the first time around.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Cammy's subs, Johnson will receive the most scrutiny.
Spiers is a proven commodity, having shared starts with Sean Berry
the past two seasons, and the 37-year-old Howell is really just a
pinch hitter who will play only when absolutely necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a fiery sort, ruffled Hunsicker's feathers when he
lashed out at the GM for sending him back to New Orleans after a
strong spring training. Thus, he's on notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russ complained about not getting a fair chance,'' Hunsicker
said. ``OK, now he's got one. It's put-up-or-shut-up time.''
</P>
<P>
   Against the Rockies, Johnson chose the former. He singled home
the Astros' first run, drew two walks to go with his two hits and
scored twice. With a full cast of heroes, the Astros won easily _
5-2 _ behind Shane Reynolds. For another day, at least, adversity
would prove an unworthy adversary.

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
During his last three starts, Shane Reynolds suffered from a ``dead
arm.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   His right arm looked plenty lively Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds pitched his first complete game in nearly a year and
the Astros took advantage of three errors by Lenny Harris to beat
the Colorado Rockies 5-2 before a crowd of 20,772 at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds (7-3) walked one and struck out eight for his 14th
career complete game and first since June 7, 1998, against Kansas
City.
</P>
<P>
   ``My last three starts, it seemed like I went through a dead-arm
period. I didn't have it in spring training, so it kind of caught
up with me now,'' said Reynolds, who was 1-2 with a 7.88 ERA in his
previous three starts. ``Usually, I go through it one or two times
during the course of a season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't leave me with very much confidence in my fastball,
and I was throwing too many split-fingers and off-speed pitches
early in the count. I'm the type of pitcher that has to throw a
number of fastballs and let the other stuff work off the
fastballs.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, add Brian Bohanon to the growing list of lefthanders
to struggle against the Astros, who improved to a National
League-best 12-2 this season against lefthanded starters.
</P>
<P>
   Bohanon (6-2) pitched six innings, allowing five runs _ four
earned _ and seven hits in losing for the first time in six road
decisions. He walked a career-high six.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros are batting .345 against lefties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been hitting lefthanders pretty well all year long,''
manager Larry Dierker said. ``We tend to hit the guys that throw
hard a little better than the guys that throw off-speed pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy (Bohanon) is definitely an off-speed pitcher. He uses
his fastball effectively, but he usually puts it on the corner just
out of the strike zone. He doesn't give you many fastballs to hit.
It's a (challenge) to hit a guy like that because his stuff looks
real tantalizing; you want to hit it, but it's not quite a strike.
I thought we showed good patience.''
</P>
<P>
   Bohanon, a North Shore product, was not entirely to blame.
Harris committed a club-record three errors at second base, two of
which led to runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros sent nine batters to the plate during a three-run
third inning, taking advantage of three hits, three walks and an
error to take a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Biggio hit a one-out double, his 21st, and scored on Russ
Johnson's RBI single. Jeff Bagwell followed with an RBI double to
put the Astros ahead. After a walk to Derek Bell, Harris couldn't
complete a double play on a grounder by Richard Hidalgo, throwing
the ball past first baseman Todd Helton as Bagwell scored.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros added two runs in the fourth when Biggio and Johnson
walked and Bell chipped in his second hit to put the Astros ahead
4-1. Harris made his second costly error when he bobbled a routine
grounder by Hidalgo, allowing Johnson to score.
</P>
<P>
   Harris tied Walt Weiss' club record for errors in a game, set in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had a game like that before,'' said Harris, who had
five errors all of last season with Cincinnati and the New York
Mets. ``I went up to Brian (after the game) and told him I was
sorry that I played so bad behind him. He told me not to worry
about it, that it wasn't my fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell, who had been 0-for-13 hitting in the No. 4 spot in the
batting order, had two singles. Bell often has expressed his desire
to hit second in the lineup, between Biggio and Bagwell, but he
approached Dierker over the weekend and volunteered to hit cleanup
while Ken Caminiti is sidelined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him if he needed me in the bottom of the lineup, that
was no problem,'' said Bell, who raised his average to .257. ``I'll
do whatever it takes to help the team win and put all personal
statistics in the back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would rather start off slow and help the team win rather
than get to the playoffs and then go cold. I'm trying to pace
myself this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Neifi Perez accounted for both Colorado runs with an RBI double
in the second inning and an RBI single in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds said his thinking was to get ahead of hitters with
fastballs, working inside and out, and then finish with off-speed
pitches. The plan worked masterfully, as he went to his fastball
more in the late innings after showing his split-finger the first
few innings.
</P>
<P>
   Rockies manager Jim Leyland left the Astrodome impressed by
Reynolds. ``That was one of the best pitching performances I've
seen,'' Leyland said. ``That's the art of pitching you saw tonight.
That was a masterpiece.''

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SOMETIMES you just have to do the math. Put fresh batteries in the
calculator. Punch in the figures. Add up the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, use your head.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of suggesting that there is a glittering collection of
NBA title rings out there waiting for the Rockets to slip onto
their fingers, if only somebody could convince Hakeem Olajuwon to
retire.
</P>
<P>
   We'll get to the basketball part in a minute. For now, just stay
with me on the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   When you add up the obligations the Rockets have for next season
with the players under contract _ Olajuwon, Scottie Pippen, Brent
Price, Matt Maloney, Othella Harrington, Michael Dickerson, Bryce
Drew, Matt Bullard, Antoine Carr and Cuttino Mobley _ it accounts
for $37.849 million, and the salary cap next season is expected to
be about $32 million.
</P>
<P>
   Now before you start salivating over the prospect of slicing
Olajuwon's $14.302 million off the top, take the time to learn that
50 percent of that amount _ $7.151 million, in this case _ still
counts against the cap when a player retires before the end of his
contract.
</P>
<P>
   That still gives the Rockets a payroll of $30.698 million,
leaving hardly enough _ $1.3 million _ to go out and attract a
young, high-impact free agent. Which is just as well. Because this
summer there won't be any.
</P>
<P>
   Shareef Abdur-Rahim, Stephon Marbury, Kobe Bryant and their
peers already have re-signed for the maximum allowable under the
new contract between the players union and the league. Do you want
Penny Hardaway, a softer Pippen?
</P>
<P>
   And oh, yes, did I mention that by slipping just under the
salary cap, the Rockets also would lose the middle-class exception
of $2 million and the $1 million exception for next season? In
other words, they would actually have less money to spend on free
agents.
</P>
<P>
   By giving Olajuwon a gold watch and sending him out to pasture,
how are the Rockets going to get better? With Stanley Roberts at
center?
</P>
<P>
   The difference in the scenario that has been drawn up to make a
parallel with the retirements of Michael Jordan and John Elway is
wider than the Grand Canyon. Has anybody out there not currently
under the influence of a mind-altering drug suggested even once
that the Bulls and Broncos would become better teams without their
bell cows? We have already seen what happened to the Bulls. And is
anybody holding open a place in next year's Pro Bowl for Bubby
Brister?
</P>
<P>
   Now for the basketball.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two games of their playoff series, Shaquille O'Neal
nearly tripled up David Robinson, outscoring him 58-22 and
outrebounding him by 29-11. Shaq also kept David tied in knots with
11 fouls, limiting him to 27 minutes per game.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson followed Olajuwon into the lion's den against O'Neal
and in the head-to-head matchup came away just as maimed. No shame
in that, since Shaq is the most physically overpowering center of
his time, rivaled all-time only by Wilt Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Admiral was taking hits to his broadside, he was
opening up opportunities for his sidekick, Tim Duncan, to devour
the Lakers. It was Robinson who took the pounding, allowing Duncan
to have the energy to make the big shots and grab the headlines.
</P>
<P>
   When Olajuwon shot face-up jumpers from the key and fadeaways on
the baseline in Game 1 of the playoffs _ 10-for-13, 22 points _ the
Rockets had the Lakers beaten until late turnovers by Mobley and
Pippen gave the game away. If the Rockets win that game, it may be
a different story entirely.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of the series, Olajuwon indeed struggled. He
committed some ill-advised fouls. He was frustrated trying to score
inside. But Pippen shot 0-for-7 in Game 2 and 6-for-23 in Game 4,
and the rookie Dickerson did not score a single field goal from the
second half of Game 1 until the series was all but over.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, Olajuwon is not the same player as in 1994 and '95
when he led the Rockets to championships. But by any reasonable
ranking, he is still among the top four big men _ with Shaq, Duncan
and Alonzo Mourning _ in the NBA. He can still be effective facing
the basket, spinning occasionally into the lane. He cannot stop
Shaq one-on-one. Nobody can. It takes a team, and that's the point.
The Rockets weren't a cohesive one very often this year. Yet they
went 31-19. They drew a bad matchup in the first round, then gave
away the first game.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a time to panic, but to improvise. In two more years
with him, they at least have a chance. If Dickerson improves, if
Pippen shows up, if Charles Barkley commits himself to getting in
shape again.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't get better without Hakeem.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, just do the math.

 By KEN THOMAS  
 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
 &HT;    NEW YORK _ Whatever happened to Candlestick Park? Jack Murphy
Stadium? Or the Brendan Byrne Arena? The well-known sports venues,
in fact, are still there. But all three go by different monikers,
part of trend to bring cash to the franchises by selling out their
traditional names.
 &HT;    Candlestick Park, the home of the San Francisco Giants and
49ers, known to legions of devoted fans as ``The 'Stick,'' operates
under the drabbish banner of 3Com Park at Candlestick Point. San
Diego's Jack Murphy Stadium, named for a local sportswriter who
successfully crusaded for a professional football team, morphed
into Qualcomm Park. And the Brendan Byrne Arena in East Rutherford,
N.J., which honored the state's former governor, is called the
Continental Airlines Arena.
 &HT;    All three reaped hefty financial deals for turning over their
identities to the highest bidder.
 &HT;    Like many other aspects of professional sports, the stadiums
themselves have gone corporate and their old names have gone kaput.
Of 118 professional sports franchises in the four major team
sports, 63 now play in stadiums with corporate names, according to
the Chicago-based Team Marketing Report.
 &HT;    ``In ten years there may not be many major league facilities
left unnamed,'' said Sean Brenner, the trade publication's editor.
 &HT;    The money makes the change worth it, sports analysts say.
Multi-year deals of more than $100 million were won by seven
franchises that inked naming-rights agreements. Typically, naming
deals span about 20 years and can mean up to $5 million annually
for the biggest urban markets.
 &HT;    Many fans complain about revered personalities and club
tradition being replaced by the soulless, sterile logos of modern
techno-businesses. To these fans, stadium names should not sound
like synonyms for the title pages of corporate annual reports.
 &HT;    In New York, where both the Mets and the Yankees are eyeing the
windfall reaped by other stadiums and may soon carry corporate
labels, local fans wonder if the changes will alter the fan
experience.
 &HT;    ``People from all over the world come to Yankee Stadium,'' said
Mitchell Staub, a 23-year-old baseball fan. ``They don't want to
come to 'Yankee Yahoo Stadium.'''
 &HT;    For all the fuss, corporate influence is nothing new in stadium
names. In 1926, the Chicago Cubs named their ballpark Wrigley
Field, honoring William Wrigley Jr., the club's owner and chewing
gum magnate.
 &HT;    But most sports historians point to the Buffalo Bills' 1973 deal
with Rich Products Co. as the first example of selling a stadium
name.
 &HT;    Since then, sports analysts say, the ground rules have changed.
 &HT;    ``It used to be more about corporate philanthropy,'' said Matt
Brown, a professor of sports marketing at Ohio University. Today,
however, corporations ``don't do it unless there's a return on
their investment.''
 &HT;    For corporations like United Airlines, whose logo beams _
purists might say blasphemes _ from the roof of Chicago's
basketball and hockey arena, the deals can cement a company's
presence in a city. And, as with Boston's Fleet Center, home of the
Celtics and Bruins, exclusivity means that only Fleet Bank
automated teller machines are found inside the arena.
 &HT;    For smaller companies, such as 3Com, a northern California-based
developer of computer networks, the benefits can boost stock prices
and the company's overall profile.
 &HT;    Soon to fall will be Tiger Stadium in Detroit. When the Tigers
wrap up their season this fall, they will bid farewell to their

 STADIUM NAME GAME GAINS STEAM, AND CASH; FANS ARE STEAMED, PERIOD

   NEW YORK _ Whatever happened to Candlestick Park? Jack Murphy
Stadium? Or the Brendan Byrne Arena? The well-known sports venues,
in fact, are still there. But all three go by different monikers,
part of trend to bring cash to the franchises by selling out their
traditional names.
</P>
<P>
   Candlestick Park, the home of the San Francisco Giants and
49ers, known to legions of devoted fans as ``The 'Stick,'' operates
under the drabbish banner of 3Com Park at Candlestick Point. San
Diego's Jack Murphy Stadium, named for a local sportswriter who
successfully crusaded for a professional football team, morphed
into Qualcomm Park. And the Brendan Byrne Arena in East Rutherford,
N.J., which honored the state's former governor, is called the
Continental Airlines Arena.
</P>
<P>
   All three reaped hefty financial deals for turning over their
identities to the highest bidder.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other aspects of professional sports, the stadiums
themselves have gone corporate and their old names have gone kaput.
Of 118 professional sports franchises in the four major team
sports, 63 now play in stadiums with corporate names, according to
the Chicago-based Team Marketing Report.
</P>
<P>
   ``In ten years there may not be many major league facilities
left unnamed,'' said Sean Brenner, the trade publication's editor.
</P>
<P>
   The money makes the change worth it, sports analysts say.
Multi-year deals of more than $100 million were won by seven
franchises that inked naming-rights agreements. Typically, naming
deals span about 20 years and can mean up to $5 million annually
for the biggest urban markets.
</P>
<P>
   Many fans complain about revered personalities and club
tradition being replaced by the soulless, sterile logos of modern
techno-businesses. To these fans, stadium names should not sound
like synonyms for the title pages of corporate annual reports.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, where both the Mets and the Yankees are eyeing the
windfall reaped by other stadiums and may soon carry corporate
labels, local fans wonder if the changes will alter the fan
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``People from all over the world come to Yankee Stadium,'' said
Mitchell Staub, a 23-year-old baseball fan. ``They don't want to
come to 'Yankee Yahoo Stadium.'''
</P>
<P>
   For all the fuss, corporate influence is nothing new in stadium
names. In 1926, the Chicago Cubs named their ballpark Wrigley
Field, honoring William Wrigley Jr., the club's owner and chewing
gum magnate.
</P>
<P>
   But most sports historians point to the Buffalo Bills' 1973 deal
with Rich Products Co. as the first example of selling a stadium
name.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, sports analysts say, the ground rules have changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be more about corporate philanthropy,'' said Matt
Brown, a professor of sports marketing at Ohio University. Today,
however, corporations ``don't do it unless there's a return on
their investment.''
</P>
<P>
   For corporations like United Airlines, whose logo beams _
purists might say blasphemes _ from the roof of Chicago's
basketball and hockey arena, the deals can cement a company's
presence in a city. And, as with Boston's Fleet Center, home of the
Celtics and Bruins, exclusivity means that only Fleet Bank
automated teller machines are found inside the arena.
</P>
<P>
   For smaller companies, such as 3Com, a northern California-based
developer of computer networks, the benefits can boost stock prices
and the company's overall profile.
</P>
<P>
   Soon to fall will be Tiger Stadium in Detroit. When the Tigers
wrap up their season this fall, they will bid farewell to their
77-year-old ballpark where hometown fans once cheered Hall of
Famers Ty Cobb, Hank Greenberg and Al Kaline.
</P>
<P>
   Next season the Tigers will move into the spanking new Comerica
Park, sponsored by Detroit's 150-year-old bank. Comerica, which
ponied up $66 million to attach its name to the stadium for 30
years, will be the team's ``official bank,'' supply the stadium
with four bank machines and air several television and radio spots
during Tiger telecasts.
</P>
<P>

Mielke of Comerica.

elements of modern sports. These same corporations wrap their
images around college football bowl games, plaster advertising on
the shirts of tennis stars and spend millions for the privilege of
advertising during the Super Bowl.

 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
 &HT;    NEW YORK _ Swishing a mouthful of Cabernet Piave, the man on a
mission to demystify wines spits and then grins. ``This is getting
weird,'' says Willie Gluckstern, a 19-year veteran of hosting wine
classes in New York City. ``This is a strange Cabernet.''
 &HT;    Dressed in an olive suit, the 6-foot-4-inch Gluckstern then asks
his four wine pouring assistants _ all charming women in their 20s
_ to hand out Peranno cheese to class members.
 &HT;    ``Cheese is the great equalizer,'' Gluckstern explains to the
group of 50 novice wine tasters participating in a class on Italian
wines at the Park Central hotel in Manhattan. ``You take the worst
crap in a glass and it tastes great with cheese.''
 &HT;    In a city where wine classes are myriad and it is hip to sniff
out the best, Gluckstern is a voice unlike any other. Gluckstern
encourages people to go beyond jug wines, to avoid overexposed
brands advertised on billboards or television, and to explore wines
from smaller vineyards.
 &HT;    Perhaps Gluckstern helped start a trend. Last year, Americans
began to abandon jug wines mass produced by the large wine
corporations in favor of smaller vintages, according to Gladys
Horiuchi of the San Francisco-based Wine Institute. ``Part of that
is the fact that consumers are becoming more knowledgeable about
wines,'' says Horiuchi.
 &HT;    It's all part of a surge in wine sales in the past two decades.
In 1997, Americans drank $16 billion worth of wine, compared with
only $6 billion in 1980.
 &HT;    Gluckstern is thrilled to see the numbers rise. And he doesn't
mind cashing in at the same time. Last summer, Gluckstern wrote
``The Wine Avenger'' (Simon and Schuster), a book filled with tips
and witty wisdom. Born in New York City, Gluckstern acquired a
taste for wine from his father, who once managed Knickerbocker
Liquors, a wine wholesaler.
 &HT;    ``He piqued my interest,'' Gluckstern says of his father. ``He
told me tales of the wine trade and about rare, long forgotten
vintages.''
 &HT;    In the early 1970s, Gluckstern wrote material for stand-up
comedians and started his ``Wines for Food'' classes, which teach
novices how to pick the right wines to accompany various foods.
These days, Gluckstern runs a Web site _ wineavenger.com _ and is
the purchasing director for the upscale wine shop Nancy's Wines in
Manhattan.
 &HT;    During the class at the Park Central Hotel, the 50 class members
spit 38 different Italian wines into blue plastic cups, and get an
earful of Gluckstern's aphorisms and rules. ``You have to spit the
wine out, please,'' he tells participants. ``I don't want to lose
you because you're drunk after an hour.''
 &HT;    Over the lively music of Italian folk singer Carlo Buttie,
Gluckstern, who is 50, sets out to debunk the myths. He tells his
audience that Chardonnay wines from California are for the most
part overrated, and that wines don't always improve with age. ``The
fact that a wine can make it to an old age,'' says Gluckstern,
``does not mean it will be a ripe old age.''
 &HT;    Many participants say that Gluckstern's teachings honed their
palettes. ``I took another class in the city and it was too
intensive,'' says Christine Fasbach, 29, as she spits out a
mouthful of Pinot Grigio. ``It was simply too involved.'' Fasbach
plans to return for classes on Germanic wines and then a class on
Champagnes.
 &HT;    ``Two things I've learned are that I like Riesling wines and
that I should pay attention to the grape the wine comes from,''
says Jennifer Teitler, 29, after attending her second class with
Gluckstern. ``And I like that Willie doesn't put on any airs.''
 &HT;    Over and over, the wine guru hammers home his message that fine
wine is not only for the elite. Expensive wines are not always the
best wines, he says, and retailers and restaurant owners jack up
prices in the name of snob appeal.
 &HT;    One of his pet peeves is the much-adored Chardonnay.
 &HT;    ``Chardonnays are a joke,'' says Gluckstern, who vilifies
American winemakers for pumping up their pallid grapes with
additives like oak chips. The wine has become a smash success only
because people have grown accustomed to the wooden oak flavor. They
also like the name. Chardonnay is easy to pronounce.
 &HT;    Not so, says Harriet Lembeck, director of the Wines and Spirits
program in Manhattan. ``I wouldn't say that most Chardonnays are
over-oaked,'' says Lembeck, who is also wine director for the New
School in Manhattan. ``You just can't make sweeping statements like
that about wine.''
 &HT;    But Willie Gluckstern does.
 &HT;    ``Those bankers, brokers and gynecologists with $85,000 wine
cellars don't know anything about wines,'' Gluckstern tells his
class at the Park Central Hotel with a smirk. ``And now you do.''

GOURMET BEANS CAUSE INSTANT A 'LATTE' TROUBLE

 c.1999 Columbia News Service  
 &HT;    NEW YORK _ As Americans spend more time and money sipping
gourmet and specialty coffees in European-style cafes, they are
turning their backs on the less costly, less time-consuming _ and,
some argue, less tasty _ beverage made from the same bean.
 &HT;    The heyday for instant coffee in this country _ during the late
1970s _ is over. Its percentage of total U.S. coffee consumption
dropped from 13 percent in 1991 to just 9 percent by 1996, an
overall decline of 30 percent.
 &HT;    Sales overseas, however, are percolating. While the 10 million
people who still drink freeze-dried, agglomerated and crystallized
java have become a minority in this country, the worldwide
prospects for instant coffee are excellent.
 &HT;    Despite slumping sales here, instant coffee, also known as
soluble, accounts for roughly half of all consumption worldwide,
according to the Tea and Coffee Trade Journal. For instance,
instant makes up roughly 90 percent of that slurped in England and
Russia. Some former Soviet-bloc countries have similarly high rates
of consumption, and the continents of Asia and Australia are
considered the next frontiers for instant coffee manufacturers and
distributors.
 &HT;    But while instant coffee makers seek to develop new markets,
they understand that a country's palate sometimes changes when its
economy improves. ``All of the developing countries drink soluble
coffee first,'' said Jane McCabe, editor at the Tea and Coffee
Trade Journal. ``Then they switch over to roasted ground coffee.''
 &HT;    Indeed, there is some debate about the potential life span of
instant coffee once it is introduced into any country. ``People
don't like the taste,'' McCabe said. ``Once they find roasted
ground, they stick with that.''
 &HT;    On the other hand, there is some hope within the industry that
the preference for instant might be more than a passing phase in
England, Russia and some Eastern European countries. Instant is
judged by more stringent minimum standards before it is sold in
countries other than the United States, said Susan Korry, who
trades coffee worldwide for the Rothfos Corp., a division of
Neumann Kaffee Gruppe, based in Hamburg, Germany.
 &HT;    ``They have quality products shipped in,'' she said. ``Whereas
here in the United States, we don't have that type of testing.
 &HT;    ``There are products on the shelf'' in the United States, Korry
said, ``which state that they're 100 percent coffee and they're
not. There might be a bean of coffee in it.'' By allowing goods of
inferior quality in supermarkets, she said, America has ``ruined''
a once $2 billion a year industry.
 &HT;    During the 1980s, when quality and sales started to slip,
Americans began to sample gourmet ground coffee in significant
numbers. Since 1991, the number of cafes devoted to the brew in
this country has grown from 500 to more than 7,000. The number of
occasional drinkers grew by 20 million last year, according to a
recent study by the National Coffee Association. As the
association's spokesman, Gary Goldstein, explained, ``You know,
people who will go out for a double cappuccino.''
 &HT;    Quantifying the precise effect all this has had on overall
coffee drinking habits can be misleading.. For one thing, specialty
drinks such as mochas, lattes and frappuccinos contain a
considerable amount of milk and sweeteners, which can be more of an
enticement than the coffee flavors in these concoctions.
 &HT;    And while there may be more Americans enjoying these frothy
drinks, their consumption is more restrained than that of coffee
drinkers 20 years ago, who used to polish off several cups a day,
said McCabe of the coffee trade journal. Offsetting this decline,
of course, is the fact that today's consumers are willing to pay
more than $3 for trendy specialty drinks.
 &HT;    Instant coffee may be on the decline as a traditional beverage.
But, Korry said, it is growing as an ingredient in bakery products,
candies, ice cream and capuccino vending machines nationwide.
 &HT;    Indeed, the meteoric growth of the gourmet and specialty coffees
is not a total disaster for instant coffee drinkers. Korry said
that in order to maintain a presence on supermarket shelves,
companies that sell instant coffee in this country have begun to
pay closer attention to the quality and taste of their products.
 &HT;    As Grace Torbus, president of Tonex Inc., which distributes its
instant coffee internationally and in the United States, explained,
``When people take a coffee break, they want to feel like they went
out to a fine restaurant or had a gourmet dessert.''

candies, ice cream and capuccino vending machines nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the meteoric growth of the gourmet and specialty coffees
is not a total disaster for instant coffee drinkers. Korry said
that in order to maintain a presence on supermarket shelves,
companies that sell instant coffee in this country have begun to
pay closer attention to the quality and taste of their products.
</P>
<P>
   As Grace Torbus, president of Tonex Inc., which distributes its
instant coffee internationally and in the United States, explained,
``When people take a coffee break, they want to feel like they went
out to a fine restaurant or had a gourmet dessert.''

FERAL CATS, NO LONGER CUDDLY, THRIVE ON MEAN STREETS

 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
 &HT;    NEW YORK _ From behind bags of trash, a dozen cat eyes gleam in
the weak beam of a sweeping flashlight. Though a locked steel gate
blocks the abandoned railroad tunnel in Manhattan's Riverside Park,
someone had slipped seven pie plates, now empty, through the rusty
bars. An eighth plate was full of kibble.
 &HT;    Few people realize it, but New York is overrun with wild and
stray cats. Seven and a half million people share the city with 1.5
million to 2 million homeless cats, according to the New York
Association for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which served
as city dogcatcher until 1995. Cats have been domesticated for
8,000 years, but trust and friendliness wear off quickly on the
mean streets. Strays become skittish and surly. Many alley cats are
completely feral _ wild animals, born on the streets, with no trust
for humans.
 &HT;    ``It is not a minor attitude problem,'' said Ira Manhoff, who
rents a basement space where he tries to get cats to ``come
around,'' or adjust to human contact. He works with five cats at a
time, and the taming process can take months. Often, it takes weeks
of petting with a back-scratcher before a cat will allow Manhoff to
use his hands. A ``floral essence remedy'' in the water dish
soothes the patient's frazzled nerves.
 &HT;    ``They are terrified,'' Manhoff said. ``They have suffered at
the hands of humans, and now they are reacting to it.''
 &HT;    Manhoff's group, Manhattan Valley Cat Rescue, has 20 reformed
feral cats in foster homes, hopefully the final step before
adoption. It is one of dozens of small animal rescue organizations
in the city. Most are groups of friends who focus on removing
kittens from the street while they are still impressionable, and
putting them up for adoption at pet stores. The ASPCA has a list of
16 organizations, and pet store inquiries produced several more.
 &HT;    In the wild, cats live in colonies, preferring dark, enclosed
spaces where hiding is easy. A railroad tunnel does well, or the
space under a construction trailer. Colonies of 60 cats are not
unusual, and as many as 100 cats are said to live together in
abandoned buildings on Manhattan's northern tip. Left to their own
devices, cats become nocturnal and secretive. Colonies form
quickly. Cats multiply at an astonishing rate _ at a litter of
eight every eight months, two cats could beget 2 million in six
years' time.
 &HT;    Feral cats may lose every domestic impulse, but never the love
for good food and a nice bowl of milk. Rescue workers say that most
wild cat colonies are supported by human ``feeders.''
 &HT;    ``They are going to go where there is food, and it is not going
to be rats and mice and birds,'' said Holly Staver, president of
the rescue group City Critters. ``There are feeders on every
block.''
 &HT;    The colony of nine cats in the Riverside Park tunnel are fed
every morning at 5 a.m. by a neighborhood woman, known as ``the cat
lady'' to denizens of the park. The people who live in the park
also help support the colony.
 &HT;    ``A lot of us, we pick up cans so the cats stay full,'' said
J.R., who lives in the park and declined to give his last name.
``We take care of them real good.''
 &HT;    For a few people, caring for cats has become a passion. With so
many needy cats out there, sympathetic humans can be overwhelmed.
 &HT;    ``I'm going broke with this thing,'' said Mary Zawada, a textile
designer who spends weekends trapping pregnant cats so their
kittens can be adopted. Lately, Zawada has been spending all of her
spare time nursing a sick kitten that needed $600 worth of
veterinary care when she picked it up off the street two weeks ago.
``My credit cards just revolve and revolve,'' she said.
 &HT;    Cats demand a certain punctuality and feeders learn to be on
time.
 &HT;    ``Time is very important to them,'' said Manhoff, who was
anxious to leave the house to be on time for his feeding
appointments. ``These are cats who don't have very much to regulate
their lives on,'' said Manhoff, adding that if he's a few minutes
late, ``the next thing you know, they are wandering around and
crossing the street and everything.''
 &HT;    The most ambitious rescuers pursue a ``trap-neuter-release''
policy. City Critters, a rescue group which raised $75,000 this
year for the cause, captures 500 wild cats each year. All the cats
are neutered and given shots, and the ones that are too wild to be
adopted are returned to their old colonies on the street.
 &HT;    The New York Center for Animal Control and Care has no problems
with rescue groups putting sterilized feral cats back on the
street. ``We are not in a position to round up all of the
animals,'' said Kyle Burkhart, director of external affairs. ``If
they spay and neuter, then we are grateful and it helps a lot.''
 &HT;    In general, the city turns a cold shoulder to its wild cat
population: they pose few health risks to humans, and in general,
only attack when cornered by a stranger. One receptionist at New
York City Center for Animal and Human Bites said she receives more
phone calls regarding human bites than cat bites.
 &HT;    Even if you are bit, it probably won't be serious, said Barbara
Null, a public health epidemiologist at the bite center. The only
disease cats carry that is transmissible to humans is rabies, and
there hasn't been a case of rabies in New York City for 20 years.
 &HT;    Budget concerns as they are, the Center for Animal Control and
Care only bothers with feral cats when neighbors complain, Burkhart
said
 &HT;    ``We get calls constantly regarding packs of wild dogs in Queens
and Brooklyn, but I can't think of a single complaint regarding
cats,'' Burkhart said. ``They tend to keep to themselves.''

HEAVING BOSOMS AND THROBBING LOINS: ROMANCE BOOKS ARE HOT 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

 By GEORGINA GUSTIN  
 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
 &HT;    NEW YORK _ When Kathy Baker meets with her reading group, they
tear a novel apart. They look at narrative tension, plot, conflict,
resolution, and denouement. They debate whether the characters were
compelling enough, the hero was sufficiently sympathetic, and the
heroine passionate but pure.
 &HT;    Shakespeare? Joyce? Balzac?
 &HT;    Not exactly. These novels have titles like ``Lord of
Scoundrels,'' ``The Unrepentant Rake,'' ``To Tame a Warrior's
Heart'' and ``A Rogue in Texas.''
 &HT;    Welcome to the steamy, stormy world of romance book fan clubs,
where the heroines are always strong but feminine and the heroes
strapping but troubled. Baker's 15-member group, called the
Heartthrobs, gets together once a month, usually in the Waldenbooks
at the Northeast Mall in Hurst, Texas, and they always have plenty
to discuss. Like Baker, most members read an average of one romance
novel a day _ 30 every month _ and are helping to make the romance
market the fastest growing market in the country.
 &HT;    The general book market may be slumping, but romance novels are
flying off the shelves faster than the racing hearts of
passion-inflamed lovers, and now account for almost 40 percent of
the entire book market, according to the American Booksellers
Association.
 &HT;    ``Romance readers are voracious,'' said Charis McEachern, a
spokesperson for the Romance Writers of America, an 8,000-member
Texas-based industry group ``Some of them read one a day, five
times a week. A lot of romance readers run out of books.''
 &HT;    And even though most academics and literati look down their
noses at the genre, fans of romance novels say there's nothing
better than curling up at the end of the day with a steamy tale of
true love and throbbing loins. And to those that say romance novels
aren't real literature, romance readers present this simple
challenge: Read one.
 &HT;    ``A lot of people don't realize the complexities of romance,''
said Pat Rouse, a columnist for Romantic Times magazine, an
industry publication with a circulation of 150,000. ``There are a
million plots in a book.''
 &HT;    The demands of romance readers are simple, however. They expect
only two things: a happy ending and absolute monogamy between hero
and heroine. But their tastes are discriminating, and what any
romance reader wants is a good story, well told.
 &HT;    ``It's important that the characters come to life off the
pages,'' Baker said. And that they do it quickly. ``Some authors
can keep your attention, but if you wait four or five chapters for
the heroine and hero to get together, it's too long. Most people
will put the book down.''
 &HT;    Under the umbrella of ``romance fiction'' there are dozens of
sub-genres, including ``women in jeopardy,'' ``western,''
``paranormal,'' ``inspirational,'' and ``futuristic.'' And with
such an array of categories romance fiction has broadened in its
appeal.
 &HT;    ``In the 70's it was just bodice rippers with a 17-year old
virgin being chased around by a landowner,'' McEachern said. ``But
in the '90s, the books are reflecting the way women are today. They
deal with real issues like child care and taking care of elderly
parents.''
 &HT;    However, she adds, ``Unlike real life, there's a guarantee with
the author. The reader knows there will be a happy ending.''
 &HT;    But it's not just a happy ending that keeps these readers
engaged. It's the network of romance readers, which has reached
something of a cult status.
 &HT;    ``If I see someone in a store buying romance, I know we'll be
friends,'' Rouse said. ``It's not just the books you read, but the
friends you make through this common interest. There's literally no
place I can go in the country where I don't have a standing
invitation to stay with a romance fan.''
 &HT;    By sending out posters to libraries across the country, the
Romance Writers of America recently tried to dispel the stereotype
of the typical romance reader. The posters, with the caption ``Look
Who's Reading Romance,'' pictured a Harvard-educated cellular
biologist, a telephone lineman, and a superior court judge, among
others.
 &HT;    ``We wanted to show it wasn't a bunch of lonely women at home
with a lot of cats,'' McEachern said.

FROM GOBLETS TO GARTERS TO WEDDING PROPOSALS, THE NET HAS IT 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as
desired.  
 By F. BRINLEY BRUTON  
 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
 &HT;    NEW YORK _ Planning to get married? Planning to have a wedding?
Planning to lose your mind?
 &HT;    For the nuptially challenged who cannot spare a year to try on
lavish white gowns, nibble on reception tidbits and shop for the
perfect bridesmaid gifts, the solution can be as close as the World
Wide Web. Wedding planning may become just a little easier with the
help of the Internet, which is looking to take a chunk out of the
$32 billion-a-year wedding industry.
 &HT;    By clicking on any one of numerous sites catering to the
soon-to-be wedded, an engaged couple can accomplish just about
everything they need for their marriage except for the proposal.
 &HT;    Wait a minute, there's a site for that, too. It's called
Ungroomed.com, and it walks the uninformed, or maybe just insecure,
gentleman through the details of choosing the perfect rock _ from
color scales to carat weights and diamond cut.
 &HT;    Ungroomed.com also gives tips on proposal speeches and, for the
more adventurous bridegroom, describes how to accomplish the
ultimate in romantic proposing on a sports stadium's big-screen
scoreboard.
 &HT;    Once the lady's hand is won, bride and bridegroom to be can
click on TheKnot.com which bills itself as the ``No. 1 wedding Web
site and gift registry.'' The company offers a dress catalogue,
gift registry, money-saving strategies and wedding countdown. It
also features a column called ``Ask Carley,'' which fields
questions on problems like how to plan an overseas wedding and ways
to handle ex-spouses at the ceremony.
 &HT;    And if you think you might like to wear red to your wedding,
TheKnot's ``nonconventional page'' will advise you on how to carry
it off.
 &HT;    TheKnot aims to help couples ``make it from proposal to newlywed
life,'' said Julie Komron, senior editor.
 &HT;    The site is ``not only for the bride, it's for everyone,'' she
added. ``We help with second weddings, third weddings, gay
weddings, interfaith weddings, intercultural weddings.''
 &HT;    There are lots of other sites, all with slightly different
flavors and themes. There's the Ultimate Wedding, The Wedding
Magazine, The Wedding Garden, Way Cool Weddings, and on and on.
There are sites for religious weddings, unconventional weddings and
small weddings.
 &HT;    ``The Internet has helped me plan my wedding more than any book
out there,'' Heather Henken said.
 &HT;    Among the online features touted by Henken were the budget
planners, although she had to adjust them to account for her
expensive New York lifestyle. Some wedding sites seem to assume
that, unlike the focused Henken, engaged couples are afflicted with
a disease in which every thought has fled their heads.
 &HT;    Weddings Online advertises an ``Automatic Wedding Speech.''
Brides or grooms need only fill in the blanks to name people they
want to thank, and finish sentences such as ``The first time I knew
there was something special between us was ...''

   NEW YORK _ Planning to get married? Planning to have a wedding?
Planning to lose your mind?
</P>
<P>
   For the nuptially challenged who cannot spare a year to try on
lavish white gowns, nibble on reception tidbits and shop for the
perfect bridesmaid gifts, the solution can be as close as the World
Wide Web. Wedding planning may become just a little easier with the
help of the Internet, which is looking to take a chunk out of the
$32 billion-a-year wedding industry.
</P>
<P>
   By clicking on any one of numerous sites catering to the
soon-to-be wedded, an engaged couple can accomplish just about
everything they need for their marriage except for the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Wait a minute, there's a site for that, too. It's called
Ungroomed.com, and it walks the uninformed, or maybe just insecure,
gentleman through the details of choosing the perfect rock _ from
color scales to carat weights and diamond cut.
</P>
<P>
   Ungroomed.com also gives tips on proposal speeches and, for the
more adventurous bridegroom, describes how to accomplish the
ultimate in romantic proposing on a sports stadium's big-screen
scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   Once the lady's hand is won, bride and bridegroom to be can
click on TheKnot.com which bills itself as the ``No. 1 wedding Web
site and gift registry.'' The company offers a dress catalogue,
gift registry, money-saving strategies and wedding countdown. It
also features a column called ``Ask Carley,'' which fields
questions on problems like how to plan an overseas wedding and ways
to handle ex-spouses at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   And if you think you might like to wear red to your wedding,
TheKnot's ``nonconventional page'' will advise you on how to carry
it off.
</P>
<P>
   TheKnot aims to help couples ``make it from proposal to newlywed
life,'' said Julie Komron, senior editor.
</P>
<P>
   The site is ``not only for the bride, it's for everyone,'' she
added. ``We help with second weddings, third weddings, gay
weddings, interfaith weddings, intercultural weddings.''
</P>
<P>
   There are lots of other sites, all with slightly different
flavors and themes. There's the Ultimate Wedding, The Wedding
Magazine, The Wedding Garden, Way Cool Weddings, and on and on.
There are sites for religious weddings, unconventional weddings and
small weddings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet has helped me plan my wedding more than any book
out there,'' Heather Henken said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the online features touted by Henken were the budget
planners, although she had to adjust them to account for her
expensive New York lifestyle. Some wedding sites seem to assume
that, unlike the focused Henken, engaged couples are afflicted with
a disease in which every thought has fled their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Weddings Online advertises an ``Automatic Wedding Speech.''
Brides or grooms need only fill in the blanks to name people they
want to thank, and finish sentences such as ``The first time I knew
there was something special between us was ...''
</P>
<P>
   To get to one of these fountain-of-all-wedding-knowledge sites,
the betrothed will probably end up stumbling through localized
companies on the Web, such as http://www.albanyweddings.com, which
tells you everything you ever wanted to know about weddings in

CRIMINALS MEET WITH VICTIMS WHOSE LIVES THEY DAMAGED 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

 By BRENDAN JANUARY  
 c. 1999 Columbia News Service   On Nov. 5, 1995, Jackie Millar lay
terrified on a friend's living-room floor as Craig Sussek decided
whether to execute her with a .22-caliber handgun or a .44 Magnum.
Satisfied that the fragmentation of a .22-caliber bullet would
cause more damage, the 16-year-old bent over Millar, pointed the
gun at the back of her head and pulled the trigger.
 &HT;    Millar did not die. Six weeks after the shooting, she awoke from
a coma. Five fragments of the bullet were still embedded in her
brain, stealing her sight and permanently paralyzing her right arm
and leg.
 &HT;    For the next three years, she struggled to relearn things that
once were as natural as breathing _ how to eat, how to walk, how to
speak. She also learned to forgive. In December 1997, Millar
visited Green Bay Correctional facility in Wisconsin, not far from
where the shooting took place, where Sussek was serving an 80-year
sentence.
 &HT;    Guided by Bruce Kittle, a mediator, Millar walked into a cramped
room furnished with three chairs and a small table. Millar recalled
that Sussek was sitting down when she entered the room limping on a
cane and dragging her right side.
 &HT;    ``I wanted him to see me,'' Millar said in a telephone
interview. ``He cried and then said how sorry he was. He said there
wasn't a day that went by when he didn't think about me.''
 &HT;    Victim and assailant met that day because of a philosophy that
is gaining popularity in the penal system _ restorative justice.
The program, which puts the offender and victim in the same room,
began in Canada and was introduced to the United States in the late
1970s. The face-to-face meetings have grown. Early on, the meetings
were informal and organized by church or other groups, with the
endorsement of local courts. Today, more than 120 restorative
justice programs exist in the United States, many of them still
somewhat informal but at least one, involving the Texas Department
of Justice, an official arm of the state's criminal justice system.
Other states, including Wisconsin, are expected to follow.
 &HT;    ``Justice should be about healing,'' said Bruce Kittle, a law
professor at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. ``Our justice
system treats crime as an offense against the state, and the state
punishes the offender. The victim is often left out of the process
and the offender never truly understands the impact of their
crime.''
 &HT;    After Sussek started serving his sentence, Millar began to give
talks at schools and prisons about the reality of crime. In her
speeches, she often said that she would one day like to meet
Sussek. A woman in the audience told Millar to call Kittle, an
advocate of the restorative justice program, and a meeting was
arranged three months later.
 &HT;    At the prison meeting, Millar said she sat silently as Sussek
recounted the details that forever changed their lives. He told how
he and a friend had left Millar in a pool of blood and escaped in
her car. He described going to a fast-food restaurant and buying
food with the money in her purse. He ended by saying how he took
the car to a parking lot and set it aflame.
 &HT;    ``He was sobbing as he told it,'' said Millar. ``I wanted him to
tell exactly what he had done to me. Not so I'd know. So he'd
know.''
 &HT;    When he finished, Millar embraced him.
 &HT;    ``I needed to hug him,'' said Millar, ``to say, 'I forgive you.'
It's not so easy to say those words. But you must say them because
it helps the victim to lay it to rest. Otherwise, you're constantly
in a state of anger and bitterness.''
 &HT;    Prison officials declined to permit Sussek to speak to a
reporter.
 &HT;    To begin the process of restorative justice, a mediator
establishes a relationship between the offender and the victim.
Kittle visits prisons to explain the concept to inmates. Some ask
him to contact their victims for a meeting.
 &HT;    Many victims reject the overture. ``You have to tell the inmate
that they're not interested,'' Kittle said. ``That's awkward.''
 &HT;    Other times, Kittle spends months or even years with victims,
establishing trust and overcoming their sense of anger and
violation, before finally scheduling the first meeting.
 &HT;    Once the victim and the offender are in the same room, Kittle
says, they follow a simple outline. First, they talk about the
crime itself. For many an offender, Kittle said, this is the first
time he or she has spoken the details aloud. Second, the victim
talks about how the crime disrupted his life. Third, victim,
offender and mediator discuss together what steps can be taken for
restoration.
 &HT;    ``When people can respond to what they've done,'' Kittle said,
``it's very moving.''
 &HT;    The program impressed Dan Bertrand, warden at the Green Bay
Correctional facility, where Millar and Sussek met for the first
time. Since that meeting, she has been invited several times to
address small groups of inmates at the facility.
 &HT;    ``It's very important for the inmates to see Jackie and to
understand what crime does to people,'' Bertrand said. ``There is a
different attitude afterwards. Some of the inmates are in tears and
can barely speak. It's one of those things that keeps them from
coming back here.''

GREEN HOPES HAVE BEEN TEMPERED IN CLINTON YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as
desired.  
 By NOELLA KERTES  
 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
 &HT;    Back in 1992, the environmentalists' wish list was long and
green. But six years after Bill Clinton's election, Beltway
politics have tempered those hopes.
 &HT;    When environmentalists look back on the Clinton legacy, they see
big strides coupled with missed opportunities. The overall
direction, they say, is positive. Yet a Republican-dominated
Congress and an administration diverted by scandals and
international conflicts have kept the environmental agenda from
enjoying the prominence they had expected under Clinton.
 &HT;    ``We have been frustrated by the fact that when he makes the
environment a high priority, things happen _ positive things
happen,'' said William Meadows, president of The Wilderness
Society. ``But he doesn't seem to keep it as his highest priority.
It's always sort of fourth or fifth on his list rather than second
or third.''
 &HT;    And as Bill Clinton sets up Vice President Al Gore, who is
strongly identified with environmentalism, to succeed him, some
activists say the administration has often traded its green-tinted
glasses for more corporate-friendly lenses. While crediting the
vice president with helping shape many green-friendly policies,
environmentalists complain that, like Clinton, Gore's attention
often has been diverted to foreign policy or other issues.
 &HT;    Leaders of eight environmental advocacy organizations, including
the Environmental Defense Fund, the Sierra Club and the World
Wildlife Fund, recently wrote to Gore expressing their ``deep
disappointment'' that the administration had not pushed more to
reduce global warming pollution through reductions of fossil fuel
emissions.
 &HT;    Environmental groups also withdrew in protest from an
administration task force on food safety, accusing the
Environmental Protection Administration of inaction on curtailing
harmful pesticides.
 &HT;    Once, environmentalists were so furious with Clinton that they
held a public denunciation, the ``21 Chainsaw Salute'' following
his signature on legislation that allowed the harvesting of certain
old-growth trees. Such trees are the foundation of forest
ecosystems, in the view of environmentalists, and should be
protected.
 &HT;    Clinton also occasionally employed a split-the-difference
approach that has left neither environmentalists nor their
corporate nemeses satisfied.
 &HT;    ``The fact is the president and the vice president have to make
choices in the political environment,'' Meadows said. ``I think
they try to get things done and perhaps they're less aggressive
than we would like them to be.''
 &HT;    Despite these qualms, environmentalists have had a strong voice
in the Clinton years, and they unanimously praise him for
eco-friendly appointments such as EPA Administrator Carol Browner
and Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt. They credit Clinton with
staving off a Republican onslaught on environmental protection
following the GOP sweep of Congress in 1994. Groups that felt shut
out of Republican policy-making, now were welcomed in White House
deliberations.
 &HT;    Administration officials point to preservation of vast areas of
western lands and regulatory crackdowns as hallmarks of the Clinton
years. But despite early efforts, the administration failed to
achieve a longstanding environmentalists' goal _ raising grazing
and mining fees on federal land, activists note.
 &HT;    ``I think he deserves the criticism but it's not so black and
white,'' said Brock Evans, executive director of the Endangered
Species Coalition, who praises Clinton for significant strides in
some areas.
 &HT;    ``I would say it's nothing short of a revolution in terms of the
Forest Service. The Northwest forests are in much better shape than
they would have been under his opponents,'' he said, citing
Clinton's three-day forest summit and the subsequent implementation
of the Northwest Forest Plan, which significantly reduced logging
in a reversal of decades-old policies.
 &HT;    Evans, on the other hand, blasts Babbitt's novel system of
negotiating with huge landowners over endangered species
protection, saying the division of land for development and for
habitat inadequately protects wildlife.
 &HT;    ``History may judge this administration as being the worst in
endangered species,'' protection, Evans said.
 &HT;    And groups pushing for restoration of Florida's Everglades were
critical of the administration for not driving a harder bargain
with sugar growers who have been ordered to pay a portion of the $8
billion pricetag to partly restore the marshlands' natural water
flow.
 &HT;    One indicator of Clinton's environmental record is evident in
the criticism from business and industry, which accuse him of
unnecessary regulatory schemes that drive industry's costs up.
 &HT;    ``EPA has enlarged its enforcement powers over the last six
years. For our industry it has been calamitous,'' said Barry
Polsky, a spokesman for the American Forest &AMP; Paper Association,
adding that regulatory action to save the Northwest spotted owl
habitat and the litigation it created had led to an 80 percent
reduction in the timber harvest in the Pacific Northwest.
 &HT;    During the last decade, he said, 13 percent of the paper
industry's capital has been spent on environmental protection, a
figure his trade association predicts will double in the next five
years, ``based on laws and regulations that are now in place or
those that we think are going to be passed.''
 &HT;    A study by the Competitive Enterprise Institute, an
anti-regulation think tank, concluded that during Clinton's first
year in office, the number of Federal Register pages announcing
government actions jumped by 7 percent, and that federal agencies
spent $17.5 billion to police their regulations in 1998.
 &HT;    ``They seem to evaluate their performance not on how clean the
environment is, but how many people they cite for violations,''
said Fred L. Smith Jr., CEI president.
 &HT;    The administration also has had to defend itself against
industry accusations that agencies have ignored science in their
zeal to implement new regulations.
 &HT;    ``We think they've abused science to scare people to get their
budgets approved or in defense of their regulations,'' said Mark
Whitenton, vice president at the National Manufactures Association,
an opponent of EPA's creeping restrictions on factory emissions.
 &HT;    Administration efforts to appease both sides sometimes have left
both disgruntled. On the dominant issue of climate change,
environmental leaders praise Clinton for raising awareness of the
earth's warming trend, but fault him for surrendering to domestic
pressures against cutting emissions of so-called greenhouse gases,
which result from the burning of fossil fuels.
 &HT;    ``We'd hoped they'd be a leader in global warming but in fact
it's all been rhetoric and very little performance,'' said Brent
Blackwelder, president of Friends of the Earth, who holds Clinton
in far greater disdain than many of his environmental colleagues.
 &HT;    Industry on the other hand, is upset that the administration
even signed the 1997 international treaty on climate change,
because it commits the United States to cutting industrial
emissions by 7 percent from 1990 levels by the year 2010, targets
that industry advocates say cannot be met without damaging the
economy. The Senate still must ratify the treaty.
 &HT;    Although some hoped-for legislative overhauls never materialized
_ such as an update of Superfund hazardous waste liability _
environmentalists heralded these actions the Clinton years:
 &HT;    _ Legislative victories on the Safe Drinking Water and Clean
Water amendments.
 &HT;    _ The California Desert Protection Act, which sets aside nearly
7 million acres of California desert, the largest tract of public
land protected outside of Alaska.
 &HT;    _ Creation of Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in
Utah.
 &HT;    Perhaps no international issue galvanized environmentalists like
the North American Free Trade Agreement that Clinton signed with
Mexico and Canada in 1993 despite activists' objections that it
would promote environmental degradation in border areas. The
conflict continues to play out as Clinton seeks so-called
fast-track authority to ink trade deals without congressional
oversight, a move the environmentalists abhor.
 &HT;    ``We're still on opposite sides,'' said Deborah Sease, Sierra
Club legislative director.

international conflicts have kept the environmental agenda from
enjoying the prominence they had expected under Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been frustrated by the fact that when he makes the
environment a high priority, things happen _ positive things
happen,'' said William Meadows, president of The Wilderness
Society. ``But he doesn't seem to keep it as his highest priority.
It's always sort of fourth or fifth on his list rather than second
or third.''
</P>
<P>
   And as Bill Clinton sets up Vice President Al Gore, who is
strongly identified with environmentalism, to succeed him, some
activists say the administration has often traded its green-tinted
glasses for more corporate-friendly lenses. While crediting the
vice president with helping shape many green-friendly policies,
environmentalists complain that, like Clinton, Gore's attention
often has been diverted to foreign policy or other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of eight environmental advocacy organizations, including
the Environmental Defense Fund, the Sierra Club and the World
Wildlife Fund, recently wrote to Gore expressing their ``deep
disappointment'' that the administration had not pushed more to
reduce global warming pollution through reductions of fossil fuel
emissions.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups also withdrew in protest from an
administration task force on food safety, accusing the
Environmental Protection Administration of inaction on curtailing
harmful pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   Once, environmentalists were so furious with Clinton that they
held a public denunciation, the ``21 Chainsaw Salute'' following
his signature on legislation that allowed the harvesting of certain
old-growth trees. Such trees are the foundation of forest
ecosystems, in the view of environmentalists, and should be
protected.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also occasionally employed a split-the-difference
approach that has left neither environmentalists nor their
corporate nemeses satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is the president and the vice president have to make
choices in the political environment,'' Meadows said. ``I think
they try to get things done and perhaps they're less aggressive
than we would like them to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite these qualms, environmentalists have had a strong voice
in the Clinton years, and they unanimously praise him for
eco-friendly appointments such as EPA Administrator Carol Browner
and Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt. They credit Clinton with
staving off a Republican onslaught on environmental protection
following the GOP sweep of Congress in 1994. Groups that felt shut
out of Republican policy-making, now were welcomed in White House
deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials point to preservation of vast areas of
western lands and regulatory crackdowns as hallmarks of the Clinton
years. But despite early efforts, the administration failed to
achieve a longstanding environmentalists' goal _ raising grazing
and mining fees on federal land, activists note.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he deserves the criticism but it's not so black and
white,'' said Brock Evans, executive director of the Endangered
Species Coalition, who praises Clinton for significant strides in
some areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say it's nothing short of a revolution in terms of the
Forest Service. The Northwest forests are in much better shape than
they would have been under his opponents,'' he said, citing
Clinton's three-day forest summit and the subsequent implementation
of the Northwest Forest Plan, which significantly reduced logging
in a reversal of decades-old policies.
</P>
<P>
   Evans, on the other hand, blasts Babbitt's novel system of
negotiating with huge landowners over endangered species
protection, saying the division of land for development and for
habitat inadequately protects wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   ``History may judge this administration as being the worst in
endangered species,'' protection, Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   And groups pushing for restoration of Florida's Everglades were
critical of the administration for not driving a harder bargain
with sugar growers who have been ordered to pay a portion of the $8
billion pricetag to partly restore the marshlands' natural water
flow.
</P>
<P>
   One indicator of Clinton's environmental record is evident in
the criticism from business and industry, which accuse him of
unnecessary regulatory schemes that drive industry's costs up.
</P>
<P>
   ``EPA has enlarged its enforcement powers over the last six
years. For our industry it has been calamitous,'' said Barry
Polsky, a spokesman for the American Forest &AMP; Paper Association,
adding that regulatory action to save the Northwest spotted owl
habitat and the litigation it created had led to an 80 percent
reduction in the timber harvest in the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   During the last decade, he said, 13 percent of the paper
industry's capital has been spent on environmental protection, a
figure his trade association predicts will double in the next five
years, ``based on laws and regulations that are now in place or
those that we think are going to be passed.''
</P>
<P>
   A study by the Competitive Enterprise Institute, an
anti-regulation think tank, concluded that during Clinton's first
year in office, the number of Federal Register pages announcing
government actions jumped by 7 percent, and that federal agencies
spent $17.5 billion to police their regulations in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``They seem to evaluate their performance not on how clean the
environment is, but how many people they cite for violations,''
said Fred L. Smith Jr., CEI president.
</P>
<P>
   The administration also has had to defend itself against
industry accusations that agencies have ignored science in their
zeal to implement new regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think they've abused science to scare people to get their
budgets approved or in defense of their regulations,'' said Mark
Whitenton, vice president at the National Manufactures Association,
an opponent of EPA's creeping restrictions on factory emissions.
</P>
<P>
   Administration efforts to appease both sides sometimes have left
both disgruntled. On the dominant issue of climate change,
environmental leaders praise Clinton for raising awareness of the
earth's warming trend, but fault him for surrendering to domestic
pressures against cutting emissions of so-called greenhouse gases,
which result from the burning of fossil fuels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd hoped they'd be a leader in global warming but in fact
it's all been rhetoric and very little performance,'' said Brent
Blackwelder, president of Friends of the Earth, who holds Clinton
in far greater disdain than many of his environmental colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Industry on the other hand, is upset that the administration
even signed the 1997 international treaty on climate change,
because it commits the United States to cutting industrial
emissions by 7 percent from 1990 levels by the year 2010, targets
that industry advocates say cannot be met without damaging the
economy. The Senate still must ratify the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Although some hoped-for legislative overhauls never materialized
_ such as an update of Superfund hazardous waste liability _
environmentalists heralded these actions the Clinton years:
</P>
<P>
   _ Legislative victories on the Safe Drinking Water and Clean
Water amendments.
</P>
<P>
   _ The California Desert Protection Act, which sets aside nearly
7 million acres of California desert, the largest tract of public
land protected outside of Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   _ Creation of Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in
Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no international issue galvanized environmentalists like
the North American Free Trade Agreement that Clinton signed with
Mexico and Canada in 1993 despite activists' objections that it
would promote environmental degradation in border areas. The
conflict continues to play out as Clinton seeks so-called
fast-track authority to ink trade deals without congressional
oversight, a move the environmentalists abhor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still on opposite sides,'' said Deborah Sease, Sierra
Club legislative director.

IN TANGO, DANCE IS SENSUAL AND LIFE ITSELF IS THE ART

 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
 &HT;    NEW YORK _ She wraps her left arm delicately around his neck,
her hand brushes the side of his cheek. He gazes at her intently
and shifts his weight toward her, firmly placing his hand just
above the small of her back. She leans forward, they raise their
arms in unison, she slips her free hand into his and they began
tracing the intricate steps of a dance shaped by four cultures
spanning three continents.
 &HT;    ``Tango is everything, everything is tango. Life is tango,''
said Carlos Funes, an elderly tango dancer.
 &HT;    Tango has been called the most sensual, complex and intellectual
of all the ballroom dances. It has its roots in Argentina in 1870,
when newly arrived immigrants from Italy, France and Spain saw the
natives dancing the ``candombe'' and added their own flavors and
flair.
 &HT;    ``The tango is more than an intricate dance,'' Jorge I. Oclander
wrote in a profile of the creator of Broadway's 1997 show ``Forever
Tango,'' Luis Bravo. ``It is a feeling, an emotion and the culture
created by the thousands of men who were forced to leave their
homes, their families, their wives and their lovers during the last
25 years of the nineteenth century by the desperate poverty of a
disintegrating Europe.''
 &HT;    Some say the dance was symbolic of the relationship between a
prostitute and her client. The upper body is held stiff. The
movement is from the waist down, only.
 &HT;    While the American idea of tango is as a passionate, mysterious
sensual dance, the Argentinean view is much different. Bravo said
tango is the dance of someone who never finds a home. And it is not
a dance of passionate love, but of lust, born in Argentinean
bordellos.
 &HT;    (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
 &HT;    ``Buenos Aires was a harbor city,'' said Kurt Klestadt, an
American who lived in Argentina for a number of years. ``Ships came
in from overseas and sailors would come in looking for a good time
when they docked.'' It was the sailors and immigrants coupled with
an African influence that gave tango its character, he said.
 &HT;    (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
 &HT;    Over the years the tango has spread from new immigrant
communities to the ballrooms of upper-class Paris and New York
venues. Some of the rougher textures of the dance have been
refined.
 &HT;    A Friday night at La Belle oque, a restaurant named one of the
most romantic places in New York with its Baroque d French wine
list, would be a rich experience without the weekly tango lesson.
But last week, 45 sleek New Yorkers, the women in short black
skirts and high heels, crowded around Tioma ``El Ruso'' Maloratsky
and his Argentinean partner, Viviana Parra, who were holding each
other inches apart as they demonstrated basic tango steps on a
small dance floor.
 &HT;    ``This is one of the only dances where the connection is in the
chest,'' Maloratsky yelled over the buzz of excited first-time
dancers trampling their partners' feet. ``The chest is closer than
anything,'' he said of the distance between partners.
 &HT;    The couples fumbled and bumped their way around the dance floor,
many of them laughing. Maloratsky told the women to balance on the
balls of their feet, leaning forward, their legs slightly behind
their body. As the man takes a step back, the woman follows with
the opposite foot, he said.
 &HT;    Men always lead. ``The best lady dancer is the one who
follows,'' Maloratsky said. ``The woman has to follow the man's
center all the time.'' To demonstrate, he darts around the dance
floor, Parra held close, her eyes to his chest, moving almost as
one.
 &HT;    She said, pointing to the door: ``You let him lead in here. Out
there, it's different.''
 &HT;    The tango came to Paris in the early 1900's. The dance made its
way to New York during World War I, when there were more than 400
tango parlors in the city. After the initial craze, tango parlors
shut down about 30 years ago. New Yorkers were re-introduced to the
dance in the late 1980's when Tango Argentino came to the City
Center with choreographer Juan Carlos Copez, who has been compared
to Fred Astaire and is in the 1998 film ``Tango.''
 &HT;    Maloratsky, 27, is Russian and learned the tango five years ago.
He said when he saw it, he had to do it. He speaks to his partner
in fluent Spanish. Americans would say she is the ideal tango
dancer _ tall, thin and elegant with long dark hair falling down
her back.
 &HT;    Parra, 28, learned the dance five years ago in Argentina. She
came to New York one year ago. She and Maloratsky teach the tango
at Carnegie Hall.
 &HT;    ``It's like in the waltz, cha-cha, salsa, merengue, you can see
very good movement,'' said Parra in a smoldering Argentinean
accent, scraping dust from the soles of her shoes, so she would not
slip. ``But you cannot see all the time the deeper feelings. With
tango the atmosphere is special. I feel that.''
 &HT;    On a recent Tuesday night at Bistro Latino, which has weekly
tango salons or milongas, tango aficionados could be found crowding
the tiny dance floor surrounded by tables. It was a special party
to celebrate ``Tango Magic'' a performance at nearby Carnegie Hall
that night.
 &HT;    The tango salon started after 1986, when the show Tango
Argentino came to New York, said Johnnie Martinez, who is married
to the owner of Steppin' Out, a dance studio that hosted one of the
first tango salons in New York. They hold a salon at Bistro Latino
every Tuesday night.
 &HT;    (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
 &HT;    Sarah LaRocca now teaches three nights a week at Steppin' Out.
She was working as an artist when she met an Argentine tango dancer
in Washington, D.C., quit her job, sold all her furniture and moved
to Argentina to learn the dance. If you ask around, said La Rocca,
you will hear many of the same stories. ``I fell in love with my
instructor,'' she said. ``It's the kind of dance that consumes
people.''
 &HT;    ``When you find the right partner, it's a very deep
connection,'' La Rocca said. ``It's a euphoric feeling and you want
more of that feeling every night. It's like an addiction.''
 &HT;    (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
 &HT;    Diane Lachtrupp owns the studio. She's been teaching the dance
for 10 years. She started to learn tango after she saw Tango
Argentino. ``I saw it and said, 'This is going to be important,' ''
said Lachtrupp. ``The emotion, the poetry of movement is not how we
live our life in America. It's relating to another person. It's
spontaneous conversation.''
 &HT;    Ralph and Phyllis Molaro started taking tango lessons with
Lachtrupp 10 years ago when Lachtrupp had just started teaching.
 &HT;    ``I saw Juan Carlos Copez do it on stage in 'Tango Argentino,'
'' Ralph Molaro, 69, said. ``I said, 'This is what I want to
learn.' ''
 &HT;    ``We used to do the American Tango,'' said his 70-year-old wife,
Phyllis, who was wearing a black sequined dress and rhinestone pin
that spelled out ``tango.'' ``It's the passion of the music, it's
so exciting, you feel every nerve in your body.
 &HT;    ``It hypnotizes you,'' she said. ``These people who dance are so
committed _ they dance every night of the week.''

 By VIOLET LAW  
 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
 &HT;    NEW YORK _ In Amagansett, N.Y., an employee angered by a late
paycheck karate-chopped a comptroller at a medical publishing
company, breaking her jaw and all but four teeth.
 &HT;    In Research Triangle Park, N.C., a scientist threw a typewriter
at a security guard who was trying to stop him from removing
property from the office.
 &HT;    In Mesa, Ariz., a supervisor for a manufacturing company was
waiting by the printer in the human resources office, when a
production worker walked in and pointed a 9-millimeter
semiautomatic at him.
 &HT;    Luckily, that supervisor managed to knock the gun out of his
hands. The worker was subsequently charged with aggravated assault.
The company, TRW Vehicular Safety System, wasted no time hiring
Lynne McClure, a management consultant specializing in workplace
violence intervention, to conduct a workshop for the management
staff.
 &HT;    At the end of the five-day workshop, McClure recalled, the
supervisor who had been confronted with the gun walked up to her
and said, ``If we'd brought you in earlier, the incident wouldn't
have gone this far.''
 &HT;    Workplace violence is nothing new, even though more often than
not, only homicides at work make headlines. In fact, other violent
incidents, such as simple assaults, aggravated assaults _ those
involving weapons _ and rapes, are far more common.
 &HT;    According to a special report on workplace violence published
last summer by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, there were 396,000
aggravated assaults and almost 1.5 million simple assaults at work
between 1992 and 1996, compared with 1,000 homicides for the same
period. A previous report tabulated close to 880,000 assaults of
any kind between 1987 and 1992.
 &HT;    For both periods, half of the violent crimes were committed by
someone unknown to the victim and another 30 percent were committed
by acquaintances, including friends, roommates, neighbors or other
employees. Researchers have cited increased stress level and
anxiety about downsizing as the main factors that provoke employees
to act out at work.
 &HT;    ``The job insecurity is the baseline for violence,'' said
Heather O'Brien, formerly a human resource director of a global
technology company who didn't want the name of the company in print
because she doesn't work there any more.
 &HT;    During her two-decade tenure, O'Brien met countless human
resource managers from manufacturing, technology and service
industries, whose attitude toward workplace violence, for the most
part, she would characterize as complacent.
 &HT;    ``Many of them think, 'It can't happen to us,' '' she said.
 &HT;    After processing numerous worker compensation claims involving
hitting, kicking, pinching and biting among co-workers, Christine
McGovern of Ohio Casualty Group, a corporate insurance company,
started in 1997 to offer for free a violence prevention program to
help her clients.
 &HT;    ``There are a lot of businesses concerned about workplace
violence,'' said McGovern, director of the program, ``but they
haven't done anything about it, or don't know what to do about
it.''
 &HT;    Recently, McGovern said a man employed by one of her clients was
hit by a co-worker with a chair after passing over that co-worker
for a promotion. Another client reported that two employees who
filed papers together in a small cubicle ended up exchanging

 WORKPLACE VIOLENCE OFTEN STRIKES BEFORE EMPLOYERS ACT  
 For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In Amagansett, N.Y., an employee angered by a late
paycheck karate-chopped a comptroller at a medical publishing
company, breaking her jaw and all but four teeth.
</P>
<P>
   In Research Triangle Park, N.C., a scientist threw a typewriter
at a security guard who was trying to stop him from removing
property from the office.
</P>
<P>
   In Mesa, Ariz., a supervisor for a manufacturing company was
waiting by the printer in the human resources office, when a
production worker walked in and pointed a 9-millimeter
semiautomatic at him.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, that supervisor managed to knock the gun out of his
hands. The worker was subsequently charged with aggravated assault.
The company, TRW Vehicular Safety System, wasted no time hiring
Lynne McClure, a management consultant specializing in workplace
violence intervention, to conduct a workshop for the management
staff.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the five-day workshop, McClure recalled, the
supervisor who had been confronted with the gun walked up to her
and said, ``If we'd brought you in earlier, the incident wouldn't
have gone this far.''
</P>
<P>
   Workplace violence is nothing new, even though more often than
not, only homicides at work make headlines. In fact, other violent
incidents, such as simple assaults, aggravated assaults _ those
involving weapons _ and
</P>
<P>
   rapes, are far more common.
</P>
<P>
   According to a special report on workplace violence published
last summer by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, there were 396,000
aggravated assaults and almost 1.5 million simple assaults at work
between 1992 and 1996, compared with 1,000 homicides for the same
period. A previous report tabulated close to 880,000 assaults of
any kind between 1987 and 1992.
</P>
<P>
   For both periods, half of the violent crimes were committed by
someone unknown to the victim and another 30 percent were committed
by acquaintances, including friends, roommates, neighbors or other
employees. Researchers have cited increased stress level and
anxiety about downsizing as the main factors that provoke employees
to act out at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The job insecurity is the baseline for violence,'' said
Heather O'Brien, formerly a human resource director of a global
technology company who didn't want the name of the company in print
because she doesn't work there any more.
</P>
<P>
   During her two-decade tenure, O'Brien met countless human
resource managers from manufacturing, technology and service
industries, whose attitude toward workplace violence, for the most
part, she would characterize as complacent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of them think, 'It can't happen to us,' '' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After processing numerous worker compensation claims involving
hitting, kicking, pinching and biting among co-workers, Christine
McGovern of Ohio Casualty Group, a corporate insurance company,
started in 1997 to offer for free a violence prevention program to
help her clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of businesses concerned about workplace
violence,'' said McGovern, director of the program, ``but they
haven't done anything about it, or don't know what to do about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, McGovern said a man employed by one of her clients was
hit by a co-worker with a chair after passing over that co-worker
for a promotion. Another client reported that two employees who
filed papers together in a small cubicle ended up exchanging
insults and punches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Non-fatal incidents like these can escalate into situations
that become dangerous,'' she said. ``But most employers are very
reactive,'' not seeing the need to prevent violence until a crisis
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're training workers to be highly skilled in math,

RESEARCHERS CITE PROMISING NEW GENE-DELIVERY METHOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- A technique for delivering genes into blood vessels
and heart tissue opens the door to an array of innovations, such as
coronary bypass grafts that stay open and heart transplants that
resist rejection, a research team reports.
</P>
<P>
   The new method forces DNA into heart and blood vessel tissue
under pressure. This avoids the need to package the genetic
material in engineered viruses, microspheres of fat, or other
delivery systems devised to insert genes where they're wanted.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage, said Dr. Victor J. Dzau of Brigham and Women's
Hospital in Boston, is a high level of efficiency in getting the
genes into target tissue without apparent risks. The new method
does not appear to damage tissue, Dzau said.
</P>
<P>
   Experiments with the new gene-delivery method were described in
a paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The high-pressure technique delivers snippets of DNA called
oligonucleotides into 90 percent of the cells lining veins. The
Brigham and Women's group is already using the method to pretreat
vein grafts with DNA that blocks cell division, in an effort to
prevent the grafts from closing up.
</P>
<P>
   As many as half of all coronary grafts reclog eventually because
the vein tissue used to bypass obstructed arteries is exposed to
much higher pressure than veins normally are. In response, cells
lining the vein grafts grow and form scar tissue. As many as half
these grafts will eventually close up entirely.
</P>
<P>
   In animal experiments, the high-pressure method was able to get
genetic material into 53 percent of heart muscle cells. The Harvard
group showed that the synthetic DNA inhibited by 50 percent the
production of proteins involved in transplant rejection.
</P>
<P>
   The animal experiments suggest that doctors may be able to
``reengineer'' human hearts genetically prior to transplantation to
make them less likely to be rejected by the donor's immune system,
Dzau said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The new method might also be used in animal-to-human organ
transplants, if other safety issues can be overcome.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible application, Dzau said, may be to deliver genes
that stimulate the growth of new blood vessels inside hearts. A
number of teams are already using gene therapy in early human
experiments to grow new blood supplies for oxygen-starved hearts,
either by injecting genes directly or by incorporating them into
disarmed viruses.
</P>
<P>
   While preliminary results from these experiments appear
promising, success might be enhanced if researchers could get the
growth-promoting genes into a higher proportion of heart cells.
According to Dr. Jeffrey Isner of St. Elizabeth's Medical Center in
Boston, only about 1 to 5 percent of cells in the target area of a
direct injection take up the injected DNA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are keeping our eyes open for anything that would optimize
gene expression,'' Isner said.

 &HT;    Baby Xena?! I'm a Xena-phobe! Jen's out, Puffy's in! (Puffy?)
 &HT;    By Loretta Grantham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ You know you've thumbed through one of
those dogeared, pink paperbacks searching for your moniker's
derivation and deep meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer: Celtic, ``white wave.''
</P>
<P>
   But a new baby-name book has been born, this one lime green and
with an attitude: Puffy, Xena, Quentin, Uma and 10,000 Other Names
for Your New Millennium Baby.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer's out. So's Kimberly, Ashley, Matthew and Robert. Also
passe: Otherwise sane names spelled weird ``that will create a
lifetime of headaches for the DMV.'' Jaeyne and Mychell, for
instance.
</P>
<P>
   The tots of tomorrow, just to name a few, are Jabot, Ide and
Quon. Baize, Ingo and Zafion. The first three are in the girls
section, but we sense a unisex trend.
</P>
<P>
   Written by Joal (dad John + mom Alice) Ryan and in stores June
7, Puffy, Xena is more than a bland roster. It's also a commentary.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan divides names into, among other categories, ``Pocket T's''
_ durable classics: Paige, Vanessa, Eric, James.
``Peanut-Butter-and-Jelly Sandwiches'' _ easily digestible: Jill,
Karen, Alan, Keith. ``Trendy Suspenders'' _ flashes in the pan:
Gwyneth, Whitney, Frasier, Garth.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it's come to this, has it?'' writes Ryan, 32. ``You, with
the living room full of cheap Swedish furniture, a decade-old
college debt and an expansive video-game collection. You, friend,
have just had your ticket to Grown-Up Land punched. So, what are
you gonna name the kid?''
</P>
<P>
   Many entries include pros and cons. Gloria: ``Plus: A safe
choice. Minus: That Laura Branigan song.'' Campbell: ``Plus: The
less trendy alternative to Cameron. Minus: The soup thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The author stresses that ``everyone's got an opinion on what's
good, bad and why.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end,'' she says, ``there are no rights and wrongs. Just
degrees of therapy bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure hope little Puffy has insurance.

 &HT;    SCIENCE/HEALTH: After life-threatening accident, teen, family
promote use of bike helmets
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The story began with the brakes locking on Jeff
Pence's borrowed bicycle, causing it to cartwheel him through the
air and onto his head.
</P>
<P>
   It almost ended there, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody agreed he would not have made it off the ground if
he hadn't been wearing a helmet,'' Judy Pence says.
</P>
<P>
   Her son would not have spent those 12 days he'll never remember
at the Children's Medical Center, fighting for his life with a
skull fracture that sheared some brain tissue, oblivious to the
gravely whispered warnings that terrified his parents, Judy and
Don. ``I never thought our life could change so quickly,'' said
Judy, who was vacationing in Lebanon, Ohio with friends at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   He also would not have spent the next year defying doctors'
forecasts by earning straight A's in his seventh-grade program for
gifted students, playing basketball and baseball and touting the
value of bicycle safety helmets on behalf of officials in both Ohio
and Florida, where the Pences live in Naples.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the things we see, the head injuries are absolutely the
worst,'' says Dr. Robert Pretzlaff, an intensive-care specialist at
Children's. ``Because they leave people with everything working
except the head.''
</P>
<P>
   Bike mishaps are the most common cause of serious head injuries
to children, the Southern Medical Journal reported in March, and
kill nearly 600 a year nationally. Although researchers have
determined that 85 percent of head injuries could be prevented by
helmets, an observational study in 1995 found only one in 20
children riding a bike wore a helmet.
</P>
<P>
   So Jeff's story evolved to Judy's self-published book, which
began as a memoir for the family of four and turned into a moving
testimonial for bike helmets. A Helmet Away From Heaven is written
for adults and kids 10 and older. The book then led to a
school-oriented video called What If, narrated by Jeff and aimed at
kids 9 to 15 and their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen them all, and this is probably the best video on the
market,'' says Jim Neary, a recently retired safety officer at
Children's. It tells everything from a child's standpoint, also.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 13, Jeff was within a month of his 12th birthday that July
afternoon in 1997. The Pences had been in Lebanon just a couple of
hours when Jeff went for a bike ride with their adult host, who
``tossed me the ugliest helmet I had ever seen, a plain white
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff's mother first thought the paramedics overreacted when they
ordered the CareFlight helicopter to the rural neighborhood where
he lay on the ground, unconscious and occasionally twitching. But
as a physical therapist in a neurology practice, Pence understood
all too well the explanations she would hear at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of his brain's speech and memory sections had been
damaged. Jeff almost certainly would have to relearn how to
communicate, and there was concern that his memory might always be
impaired. But first he had to survive.
</P>
<P>
   For three days, his brain pressure measured in the 40s. ``Normal
is well under 10,'' Pence says. His injured brain had swelled like
an injured ankle.
</P>
<P>
   The equivalent of a cast to immobilize the brain was to put Jeff
in a drug-induced coma. ``They wanted his brain to have no
stimulation so it could heal,'' Pence says. ``They didn't even want
an eyebrow to move.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after he came out of eight days in a coma, his legs would
shake spastically and his eyes would roll in different directions.
Doctors worried that even after recovering otherwise, Jeff's
spasticity and double vision would linger.
</P>
<P>
   After 12 days at Children's, Jeff was able to sit up without
being supported and stay awake for 10 minutes at a time, so he
traveled by ambulance to the nearest inpatient pediatric
rehabilitation center, Children's Hospital Medical Center in
Cincinnati. Doctors who first examined him there on a Thursday
expected him to stay three to four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But he started walking with help on Friday and independently on
Saturday. When Pence woke up Sunday morning, she was amazed to see
Jeff reading. His eyes were as good as ever. His legs no longer
twitched from muscle contractions.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff underwent speech therapy, cognitive testing and memory
exercises. He shot baskets to regain his coordination and played
catch with a tennis ball. ``It was kind of hard to catch it,'' he
says, without his hands moving quite where he wanted them, but that
Monday he was walking backwards on a balance beam, only five days
after he had not been able to sit up by himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got lost in the tunnels of the hospital on Monday and he
said, `Mom, take a left here,' `` Pence says. ``So it wasn't long
before his memory was better than mine again.''
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday, he would check out of the hospital and ride with
his mother back to Dayton, where people greeted him with tears in
their wide eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff and his younger sister had grown up always wearing helmets
when they biked at home. ``The most important thing in this whole
process is the parent made the kid wear a helmet,'' says Neary, who
knows five or six healthy children who would be dead now if they
hadn't worn bike helmets.
</P>
<P>
   In three cases, the parents made the child wear the helmet. In
another instance, Neary knows of a father who gave in and let his
son ride without one, 15 minutes before his fatal accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 36, and I remember getting a new car with seat belts when
I grew up,'' Pence says. ``In our other car, we hopped back and
forth from the front seat to the back seat. I remember lying out in
the sun with baby oil for a better tan. I remember being introduced
to this new thing called a car seat for babies.''
</P>
<P>
   She hopes people will soon look back the same way at the days
when kids didn't wear bike helmets. It's coming slowly, Neary says.
The social acceptability of helmets isn't dwindling, but it hasn't
increased much in 10 years, either. ``That's what's discouraging,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Pence and Neary agree the impetus has to come from parents.
That's why Pence urges school districts that buy her bike-safety
video to also show it at parents' meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It touches on why you wear a helmet, what it protects and that
you're not a nerd if you wear one,'' Neary says. ``We still get
100-odd children in the hospital with bike injuries every year and
maybe four or five were wearing helmets. This video does a good job
of telling children, `It's important that you wear a helmet, and
don't care what anybody else thinks about it.' ``

 &HT;    Two assistants survive cut under new coach
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Michael Hunt has lived in six cities the past 11
years. And he nearly made it seven in 11, had new Georgia
basketball coach Jim Harrick decided not to retain him on his staff
one month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the life of a college assistant basketball coach. While
head coaches can live for years off the income from their
guaranteed contracts, assistant coaches work on year-to-year
agreements and risk not being able to take care of their families.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Hunt, 38, considered giving up a promising
career in the game he loves so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``The toughest part of being an assistant coach is you have to
move to achieve your goals, which is to one day be a head coach,''
Hunt said. ``After (Ron Jirsa's firing), I wasn't sure if I could
just yank up my family and tear apart their lives again. We came to
Athens with a plan to be here a lot longer than two years. My kids
really like it here and my wife had adapted well. I wasn't sure I
could put them through that again.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunt was offered at least one coaching opportunity, a head
coaching job at North Florida Community College but turned it down.
He was also considering outside opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Hunt, a career change was not in order. On April
22, Harrick said he was retaining Hunt and fellow Jirsa assistant
Reggie Rankin on his new staff. They were joined later on Harrick's
staff by former San Diego State assistant James Holland and former
UCLA player Cameron Dollar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big relief knowing my family wouldn't have to move
and start over again,'' Hunt said.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Waters, 55, was not so lucky. Waters, who gave up his
stable, 17-year job as South Carolina-Spartanburg's coach to join
Jirsa's staff two years ago, found himself as Georgia's odd man
out. He made a quiet campaign to succeed Jirsa as head coach and,
ultimately, has instead found himself out of a job.
</P>
<P>
   The experience has left Waters bitter and disenchanted with
coaching on the Division I level.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cutthroat, regardless of what administrators want you to
think,'' said Waters, who has returned to college to get
re-certified as a teacher. ``They talk about graduation rates,
developing character, gender equity, all that stuff. When it comes
down to it, it's about money and winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Contributing to the angst of Georgia's assistants was the rather
awkward circumstances they found themselves in during the
transition period between coaching staffs. While they were hired by
Jirsa, their contracts ran through June, so they were obligated to
continue working for Georgia, even though Harrick had already been
hired and their future in Athens was in question.
</P>
<P>
   And Harrick left them little work to do. With little time to
ponder staff decisions and the spring recruiting period running
out, Harrick chose to handle most of the recruiting himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I explained that to them,'' Harrick said. ``I said, `Right now
you don't have a job and you're going to have to interview to get
one.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Waters' son Jason has just received a master's degree
in sports management and wants to become a basketball coach. Waters
is torn about his son's choice of vocation. ``In a way, I hope he's
spared the anguish,'' Waters said.

 &HT;    Pieces coming together for Georgia's Harrick
 &HT;    (EDS: Runs w/BKC-HARRICK-ASSIST)
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Jim Harrick is still trying to find his sense of
direction.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two months, the new Georgia basketball coach's
``home'' has been Room 501 at the Georgia Center for Continuing
Education, the university's hotel and conference center. He's
scheduled to move out next month _ ``They're going to put up a
plaque in there in my memory,'' Harrick cracks _ as he and wife,
Sally, finally closed last week on a beautiful house on the west
side of town. Until a few days ago, however, he was telling people
it was on the east side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still finding my way around,'' Harrick says.
</P>
<P>
   That's understandable considering the first day Harrick laid
eyes on the city of Athens was the day he was announced as the
Bulldogs' new coach. Despite a longtime friendship with former
Georgia coach Hugh Durham and nearly 30 years in the college
coaching business, Harrick hadn't had cause to visit the ``Classic
City'' and didn't bother to do so before making the life-altering
decision that sent him here.
</P>
<P>
   And in the 53 days since starting his new job, Harrick has spent
little time in Athens, or any other city for that matter. Before
the spring recruiting period ended last weekend, Harrick's world
consisted of an endless stream of airport terminals, cramped
coaches' offices, gymnasiums and hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   It's only of late that Harrick has been able to slow down long
enough to survey his new surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been really hard, the first month or so,'' says Harrick,
who was named the Bulldogs' 19th men's basketball coach on March
31. ``Everything was so unsettled, not having a staff in place,
trying to recruit and trying set up the schedule. You try to put
your stamp on everything, which means your doing everything all by
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Including recruit. With Ron Jirsa's assistants still on payroll
but their futures in limbo, Harrick hit the road himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought if I was going to ask somebody to come play for me
at Georgia, they'd want to be recruited by me. So I just kind of
handled everything myself,'' Harrick says.
</P>
<P>
   That proved to be a successful formula. Despite the controversy
derived from his momentary indecision to accept the Georgia job and
having just over a month to locate, recruit and sign prospects,
Harrick managed to ink a pair of 6-foot-7 junior college
All-Americans _ Shon Coleman and Anthony Evans _ who are expected
to shore up the Bulldogs' shaky inside game.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiting is something Harrick takes very seriously and
apparently does very well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recruiting is your lifeblood,'' he says. ``People ask you how
you're doing during the season and you say nothing a couple of wins
couldn't cure. Well, in recruiting, there's nothing a couple of
recruits couldn't cure.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's 1999 recruiting class has received national acclaim
and was ranked as high as ninth in the country by one recruiting
service. And Harrick insists he's not through.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking to our contacts in Europe, Asia and Africa,''
Harrick says, only half joking.
</P>
<P>
   Because he has been on the go since his arrival, most Georgians
have little knowledge of Harrick beyond the single-paragraph
biographies that have been offered in newspaper accounts of his
hiring.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, most people do not realize Harrick is an English
teacher by trade. He spent 10 years in the California education
system as a teacher, coach and administrator. And so it follows
that he is a voracious reader, recently switching his tastes from
non-fiction to fiction and digesting the works Robert Ludlum, Tom
Clancy, Sidney Sheldon and Bob Tannenbaum, the former New York City
district attorney and mayor of Beverly Hills who also happens to be
Harrick's personal attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Harrick and his wife Sally were high school sweethearts, have
been married 38 years and have three sons, Monte, 36, Jim, 34 and
Glenn, 30. Both Harrick and Sally graduated from Stonewall Jackson
High School in Charleston, W.Va., and have been married 38 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really a Southerner,'' Georgia athletics director Vince
Dooley points out. ``People tend to think of him as a Californian
because he spent so much time out there, but he's not. He's a
Southerner and he speaks the language very well.''
</P>
<P>
   The third-generation grandson of Lebanese immigrants, Harrick's
father was an entrepeneur who ran a hotel in Charleston, W.Va., and
owned a restaurant, Harrick's Grill. ``We struggled a little but we
always had everything we needed,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Harrick played college basketball at the now-defunct University
of Charleston (now known as Morris Harvey). ``I was a horrible
player,'' he confesses, ``but a good student of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrick's hobbies include golf, tennis and racquetball, but he
does a lot less of the latter two since entering the sixth decade
of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good guy, a fun guy to be around,'' says Durham, who's
been friends with Harrick since his early days at UCLA. ``He's a
competitor, I'm telling you. We had some hellacious racquetball
matches.''
</P>
<P>
   Durham says Harrick is also an exceptional basketball coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason to believe he won't be successful at
Georgia,'' the Bulldogs' all-time winningest coach says. ``He's
gotten it done at Rhode Island, UCLA and Pepperdine. He'll get it
done there.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrick has a trivia question he likes to ask basketball fans at
the many banquets and booster club functions he attends throughout
the spring and summer.
</P>
<P>
   How many Division I coaches have won national championships at
two different schools? Invariably, it stumps the panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a trick question,'' Harrick says with a devious grin.
``There aren't any. Never been done.''
</P>
<P>
   That fact, more than any other, can be attributed to Harrick's
presence in Athens. One day, he wants the answer to that question
to be ``Jim Harrick.'' He already won a national championship at
UCLA in 1995, and he believes he can achieve that feat at the
University of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Really.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a great university, a university of the highest
quality, it's in a wonderful area, it's got the resources to help
you succeed, it's got a great recruiting base and you're competing
in the SEC,'' Harrick says.
</P>
<P>
   ``There not many coaches I know that don't want to play for all
the marbles and you have a much better chance of doing that here.''
</P>
<P>
   But coming to Georgia wasn't that simple for Harrick. In what is
now an infamous bout of indecision, Harrick had second _ then third
_ thoughts about accepting the Georgia job. The morning after a
nationally-televised press conference announcing his hiring by the
Bulldogs, Harrick told UGA President Michael Adams he had decided
instead to remain at Rhode Island. After returning to Providence
that afternoon, he changed his mind again and decided to return to
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Harrick now jokes about it in his banquet-room speeches _ ``not
many guys can make the people in two states mad,'' he quips _ but,
in reality, it was no laughing matter. With two months to reflect
on the situation, Harrick attributes the indecision to family ties,
professional loyalty to Rhode Island and the small window of time
Georgia gave him to make a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``In business, or when you're hiring university presidents or
ADs, they go through a screening process, they're interviewed three
or four times and a committee decides who's hired. In athletics, in
most cases, it tends to be a 24-, 48- or 72-hour decision,''
Harrick says. ``I had a son on my staff (at Rhode Island) and my
youngest son had just moved to Providence and was building a house.
You have a feeling that you're turning your back on people and I
struggled with that.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, Harrick confesses, he still agonizes over his
decision. ``But that's subsiding each day.''
</P>
<P>
   So the real question would seem to be, why come to Georgia?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was the lure of the SEC, competing against the
best,'' Harrick says. ``You want to go out and recruit players to
play in the best conference and compete at the highest level and
you can do that at Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Harrick will find out if he can win there as well.

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ The short story, as I recollect it, was set in a
future where time travel had become possible. A fellow signed up to
tour the primeval past and, like others, was cautioned to remain on
the floating path and to touch nothing, because even the smallest
alteration in the past could have huge consequences. He made the
trip and marveled at the exotic plants and creatures of an era
beyond reckoning. He scrupulously stayed on the path, but returned
to his own time to find everything changed grotesquely, and in no
way for the better. Puzzled, he sat down, only to discover, from
the evidence on his shoe sole, that in the ancient past he had
stepped on a butterfly. (Teepen, Cox Newspapers) MOVED MONDAY.

   BIKE-HELMET-SAFETY _ DAYTON, Ohio _ The story began with the
brakes locking on Jeff Pence's borrowed bicycle, causing it to
cartwheel him through the air and onto his head. It almost ended
there, too. ``Everybody agreed he would not have made it off the
ground if he hadn't been wearing a helmet,'' Judy Pence says. Her
son would not have spent those 12 days he'll never remember in the
hospital, fighting for his life with a skull fracture that sheared
some brain tissue. ``I never thought our life could change so
quickly,'' said Judy. He also would not have spent the next year
defying doctors' forecasts by earning straight A's in his
seventh-grade program for gifted students, playing basketball and
baseball and touting the value of bicycle safety helmets on behalf
of officials in both Ohio and Florida, where the Pences live in
Naples. So Jeff's story evolved to Judy's self-published book,
which began as a memoir for the family of four and turned into a
moving testimonial for bike helmets. A Helmet Away From Heaven is
written for adults and kids 10 and older. The book then led to a
school-oriented video called What If, narrated by Jeff and aimed at
kids 9 to 15 and their parents. (Lamb, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.

   DISPATCHES FROM DREAMSVILLE: Childhood memories of the piney
woods
</P>
<P>
   (''Dispatches from Dreamsville'' is an occasional series in
which readers share with Cox Newspapers senior writer Joe Murray
their memories of growing up in small-town America. Back then, or
at least the way we remember it, life was like a dream.)
</P>
<P>
   By Carrie Hestand
</P>
<P>
   Special to Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   My father's family had a small farm in Louisiana, but when he
and my mother married, he went to work for a lumber company for a
dollar a day.
</P>
<P>
   We lived in a two-room cabin that could be put on a railroad
flatcar and easily moved through the Louisiana forests as my
father's job moved. I guess that would be called an employee
benefit today.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, my father's job was to cut down those beautiful long leaf
pine trees. There is no way I can fully describe those pine woods
of my childhood, how beautiful they were.
</P>
<P>
   I have to say that the lumber companies did replant the forests.
The loblolly pines we know today are beautiful, and they help save
the soil.
</P>
<P>
   They keep growing to provide a crop for the paper mills and
that's important, too, but I feel sorry for all the people who
never got to see those majestic long leaf pines that used to grow
there.
</P>
<P>
   My brothers and I and the children of the other lumber workers
had a wonderful playground there in the piney woods, and I'll
always be grateful for that experience.
</P>
<P>
   The first time I remember us being loaded on the railroad car to
move, I was barely two years old -- but I already knew how to pray.
</P>
<P>
   My two oldest brothers were old enough to go to school at that
time. They rode to school in a wagon pulled by two mules and driven
by a boy whom they had had fights with.
</P>
<P>
   You might say there was strong mutual dislike. The boy refused
to stop at our house, so my brothers would get a running start and
leap onto the back of the moving wagon.
</P>
<P>
   The mules were named Rock and Kate, but I always thought they
were called ``Rotten Cake.'' I couldn't understand why those people
would give their mules such a weird name.
</P>
<P>
   The times weren't easy, but I guess we were just too young to
know it. We thought we had a great life.
</P>

 &HT;    Retirement mecca status faltering
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Call the Department of Elder Affairs in
Tallahassee to inquire about retiring to Florida _ as thousands of
out-of-staters do every year _ and you're not going to hear about
sugar-sand beaches, emerald golf courses or the army of senior care
experts and institutions here to care for you if you falter.
</P>
<P>
   But you will be warned of what you might be giving up:
government benefits, four seasons, proximity to your family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as negative as it sounds,'' said Louise Engle, an
information resource coordinator at the department. ``We just want
to make sure people understand they may be getting some benefits
where they are now that they won't be getting here . . . and to
understand that this is a different way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Call Arizona, Mississippi, Alabama or Texas and you'll get an
altogether different response _ a come-hither sales pitch worthy of
Dale Carnegie.
</P>
<P>
   In the world of retirement destinations, Florida is still the
800-pound gorilla, but things are changing and the Sunshine State
will likely not be the de facto choice for Baby Boomers that it was
for their parents and grandparents. In 1990, Florida landed eight
communities among the top 25 in Retirement Places Rated. In the
fifth and latest edition, due for release this week, it posted just
five. Boca Raton was the highest rated at No. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Blame decades of sprawl, comparably high crime rates and a
creeping cost of living, author David Savageau said.
</P>
<P>
   And just as importantly, blame competition. Retirees vote with
their feet. Of the 450,000 seniors aged 60 and older who moved to
Florida from 1985 to1990, 128,000 left, according to Charles
Longino's book Retirement Migration in America. Florida may be the
foremost retirement state, but along with New York, Illinois and
Michigan, it is also among the states from which the greatest
number of retirees leave. Northerners who come here and then take
off have even earned their own name: halfbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``A halfback is someone who moves from New England or New York
or Cleveland, down to Florida, becomes disillusioned and instead of
returning home, moves halfway back to the Carolinas or Alabama,''
explains Savageau. ``Believe me, there are a lot of states that are
marketing to those seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   That marketing includes the 75,000 magazines sent out of state
to anybody who calls Arizona's Office for Senior Living. An army of
telemarketers tout Mississippi's good graces to prospective
retirees and Pennsylvania's Silver and Gold Magazine gets sent out
to 100,000 senior citizens statewide. Tennessee, South Carolina,
Georgia, Alabama, Texas and even Maine are all following suit.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's pitch? Think twice. It's really hot down here in the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if Florida is about to be supplanted as the nation's
retirement mecca anytime soon. A list of the boons retirees have
brought here compared with the rest of the nation is laughably
lopsided. Between 1985 and 1990, the net annual retirement income
transferred here from other states was $6.5 billion, according to
Retirement Migration in America. Retirees who moved to Arizona, the
No. 2 beneficiary of retirement income, brought just a sixth of
that.
</P>
<P>
   But the financial impact could be felt down the line if the
wealthiest retirees are lured to other states. Marketing campaigns
target retirees with good insurance and money in the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona, for instance, advertises in four magazines targeted to
an upscale clientele. As defined by the state's Department of
Commerce, that means seniors with an annual retirement income of at
least $40,000 and a net worth of $350,000 or higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``The census bureau predicts our (retired population) is going
to double in the next 20 years,'' said Cindy LaRue, director of
Arizona's Office of Senior Industries. ``We are just trying to make
sure that as many of those people are as affluent as possible . . .
It brings in money only if you bring in retirees who can afford to
pay their way.''
</P>
<P>
   So where are the folks with money going? To the places with more
room, less congestion and fewer, well, old people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby boomers don't want to see themselves as the same kind of
old person as their parents or their grandparents,'' said Susan
MacManus, a political science professor at the University of
Southern Florida in Tampa who has written extensively about
retirement trends. ``The pace (of retirees moving to Florida) will
slow down as the boomers make other choices in more remote areas.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Savageau, the most desirable retirement communities
are now in the west and a growing number are college towns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boomers planning for retirement may be headed away from
traditional California or Florida spots their parents settled,''
Savageau said. ``The fastest growing parts of the country are now
on the western slope of the Rocky Mountains and in suburban parts
of the Desert Southwest.''
</P>
<P>
   Savageau based his ratings on six factors: cost of living,
climate, crime, available services, job prospects and leisure
living (which took into consideration such things as restaurants,
golf courses, theaters and outdoor recreational activities). Out of
100 possible points, Boca scored very well in leisure living and
services _ 95 and 92, respectively _ and very poorly on cost of
living _ 32.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Florida still claimed the most communities of the 187
considered, Savageau said. ''And everybody is watching (those
communities) to see what to do and what not to do.''

<P>
   ALMA, Mich. _ Life's journey may pass through the very gates of
hell, but, just maybe, you can go home again.

in the center of the lower part of the state, according to Michigan
records. Symons is still a bishop and is back at work. He says
Mass, hears confessions and leads retreats.
</P>
<P>
   The bishop's path from Champion to Alma, from one small farming
community to another, has been filled with honor and disgrace,
service and suffering and, possibly, at the end, peace.
</P>
<P>
   The church, which successfully suppressed all knowledge about
Symons for nearly a year, no longer conceals his whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   He has reentered pastoral ministry in the dioceses of Lansing
and Saginaw, but the church in Michigan restricts his ministry to
adults.
</P>
<P>
   Symons left Florida abruptly after resigning last year. When
accused, Symons admitted he had sexually abused five young men as a
young priest more than 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The fallen bishop, who had served the five-county diocese of
Palm Beach for nearly eight years, was quickly and quietly whisked
out of town. He left a perfunctory written word of regret to the
220,000 Roman Catholics in the diocese.
</P>
<P>
   There had been no hint of his whereabouts, his spiritual state
or his physical well-being for more than 11 months. Symons just
disappeared. Church spokesmen said he was in a treatment center but
wouldn't say where.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, he surfaced as the leader of a day of prayer
dedicated to the Virgin Mary at the St. Francis Retreat Center in
Dewitt, Mich., about 6 miles north of Lansing, the state capital.
</P>
<P>
   He has taken up residence in a small, red brick cottage owned by
the Sisters of Mercy Convent in Alma, about 50 miles north of
Lansing, according to motor vehicle records. Alma is in the Roman
Catholic Diocese of Saginaw.
</P>
<P>
   The church publicized Symons' leadership of the day of prayer at
the retreat center, which is owned by the Diocese of Lansing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if Bishop Symons was in a position to
do something like this on some kind of basis,'' said Bishop Anthony
O'Connell, who was installed as the new bishop of the Palm Beach
Diocese in January. ``The Lord restored Peter even though he had
let the Lord down badly.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, attempts by The Palm Beach Post to learn more of Symons'
status were unsuccessful. Telephone calls last Thursday from West
Palm Beach to diocesan leaders in Lansing were not returned.
Spokesmen had little to say. The church in Michigan quickly wrapped
a protective blanket of secrecy around Symons.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Savage, the business manager of the retreat center,
acknowledged by phone that the bishop led the retreat but said he
knew no details. Savage said he would forward to Symons a request
for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   But last Friday, a reporter for The Post met even louder silence
when he showed up at the center in DeWitt. Savage was off for the
day. Retreat leaders were behind closed doors in sessions with the
faithful.
</P>
<P>
   Staff members at the center's reception area confessed to
feeling uncomfortable even talking about the center and recommended
asking questions at diocesan offices.
</P>
<P>
   Next, a visit to the convent complex 44 miles away in Alma met a
still icier reception. The reporter took the convent's ``Welcome''
sign at its word, entered the vestibule of the spacious mother
house and called, ``Hello?''
</P>
<P>
   A tall, smiling sister in a modern, dark blue habit arrived,
smiled and asked whether she could be of assistance. The reporter
asked to see Bishop Symons. The nun walked into a dining room as
the reporter followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a moment,'' the sister said. ``I'll see if he's
available.''
</P>
<P>
   She left the room and soon returned saying, ``The bishop is not
available.'' But she said the reporter could leave a note for the
bishop and gave him paper and pen.
</P>
<P>
   The note asked Symons to consider an opportunity to talk,
through an interview, with his former flock in Palm Beach, who
cared for him and knew nothing of his life for nearly a year.
</P>
<P>
   Then another sister appeared.
</P>
<P>
   She was agitated, accused the reporter of entering a private
home uninvited and ordered him to leave the convent. He apologized
and rose to leave, asking if he could leave the note. The first
sister took the note. The second said, ``There is no one to leave a
note for. Please leave.''
</P>
<P>
   The reporter left the convent, which includes several buildings
along a tree-lined street in a middle class neighborhood about a
half-mile from Alma's main street, which is called Superior.
</P>
<P>
   Alma is a center for farming life and has a gas refinery for the
Total company, a small Presbyterian college named after the town
and dozens of churches.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy McClintic, 42, was born in Alma. Her husband, Art, grows
sugar beets, corn and cucumbers on 1,700 acres just south of the
town that is surrounded by gentle rolling hills and vast fields of
rich soil. The McClintics are members of the Alma Wesleyan Church
and are happy to talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of nice people here,'' Nancy McClintic said.
``Even for a college town, it's quiet. People don't lock their
doors here. When anyone is down and out, they are here to help.''
</P>
<P>
   The priest at St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church echoed those
small-town sentiments and said he didn't know that Symons was at
the convent. Apparently few in Alma did.
</P>
<P>
   As the reporter was leaving the little town, he called the
convent to leave a telephone number Symons could use if he chose to
speak. The sister who answered told him to call the Diocese of
Lansing and hung up.
</P>
<P>
   When contacted, Michael Diebold, director of communications for
the diocese, said that Lansing's bishop had issued a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bishop Carl Mengeling has given Bishop Keith Symons permission
to lead spiritual retreats for adults who seek to know and love
God,'' Diebold said.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``And we're not taking any questions.''

 &HT;    Seeing is believing: Artist's copycat creations bring
masterpiece touch to small Georgia town
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOGANSVILLE, Ga. _ Van Gogh's ``Sunflowers'' really catches the
afternoon light. ``Mona Lisa'' smiles enigmatically as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Surprised to find them here in a stripped-down storefront on a
small-town Georgia Main Street otherwise given over to antiques
emporiums? Wonder how the High Museum of Art missed out on this
blockbuster? While you're pondering these questions you should
check out Picasso's epic war polemic ``Guernica.''
</P>
<P>
   These three and 64 other ``masterpieces'' are here in a place
that celebrates artifice, the International Art Museum of
Re-Creations. If you think the notion of a museum with a collection
of faux art is strange, it's no less odd than how it came to be
located in Hogansville, 55 miles southwest of downtown Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   It's the dream-come-true of Paris-born artist, author,
photographer and gadabout Jacques Harvey, who has spent a lifetime
aping the masters.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother still has a painting of a church I did when I was 7,
in the style of Van Gogh,'' says Harvey, 61, who estimates he's
painted more than 2,500 reproductions in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey got the idea for the museum in 1994, from his manager's
nephew, an art student from rural France who complained that the
famous museums of Paris were too far away to visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The original versions of these paintings are in France,
Belgium, Japan _ all over the place,'' Harvey says. ``People can
come here and learn about all these paintings, and about the
artists who painted them. It's very educational.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a visiting group of students from Callaway Middle
School in nearby LaGrange recently was led on a scavenger hunt
through the collection. Each was given a list of items to find,
with the ultimate goal of getting them to study the canvases
closely.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey concedes that his reproductions ``are not exactly the
same as the originals. But I would say they're 99 percent the
same.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, an art expert might be able to detect a certain
coarseness in the re-creation of Manet's ``Luncheon on the Grass,''
or notice a slight difference in the pigments used to depict
Munch's ``The Scream.'' But amateur art buffs will appreciate
Harvey's obsessive attention to detail _ the only thing missing
from these works is the original signature. ``That would be
illegal,'' notes the artist, who promises to add 33 more pieces to
the collection in the months to come.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, nobody will mistake his quaint digs _ a former used
furniture store in downtown Hogansville, population 3,750 _ for the
Louvre. In fact, Harvey had once sought a flashier home for his
collection. He says he was ``in discussions'' with Mirage Resorts
mogul Steve Wynn about showcasing the paintings at Bellagio, the
Las Vegas gambling palace. The talks didn't pan out, and Harvey
jokes that Wynn ``took my idea.'' (Bellagio boasts a museum stocked
with Cezannes, Modiglianis, Renoirs and Degas _ real ones.)
</P>
<P>
   Restaurateur and longtime friend Patrick Terrail convinced
Harvey to bring his copycat creations to Georgia. The two met in
the early 1970s, when Harvey frequented Terrail's Beverly Hills
eatery Ma Maison, a favorite haunt of Hollywood celebs. Actor Gene
Kelly, one of Terrail's business partners, asked Harvey to paint a
reproduction of a Dufy masterwork. Word of the artist's talents
spread through the Hollywood community. Soon, he was copying
Monet's ``Waterlillies'' for Lucille Ball and faking a Renoir for
Johnny Carson.
</P>
<P>
   Terrail, 57, discovered Hogansville during the 1996 Atlanta
Olympics, while working as a consultant for the liquor company
Hiram Walker. Recovering from cancer treatments, he decided the
town was ``a relaxing place to settle.''
</P>
<P>
   Terrail contacted Harvey, who resides primarily in Miami, and
suggested Hogansville as a possible site for the museum. He put his
painter pal in touch with John Jones, another former Ma Maison
patron who had relocated to Georgia. Jones owns several buildings
in downtown Hogansville and would like to see it become a popular,
antiques-anchored shopping village like Dahlonega. He offered
Harvey the storefront, rent-free.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to bring people to a town that has been bypassed,
but hopefully whose time has come,'' says Jones. ``We hope the
museum will convince people with an interest in art to move here,''
he adds, optimistically.
</P>
<P>
   For Harvey, the price was right, though he still had to invest
about $400,000 of his own money to renovate the property.
</P>
<P>
   The museum opened April 3 and is supported by donations and
admission fees. To attract student and senior citizen
organizations, the museum has set its group rate at $3.50 _ a
dollar less than a single adult admission.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey continues to make a living selling art reproductions.
He's painting a Chagall and a Cezanne for a British collector who
plans to store the originals in a vault and display the copies in
his home. ``That happens a lot,'' Harvey says. ``It costs so much
to insure these multi-million dollar paintings. People want to make
sure they're safe.'' His pieces sell for $4,000-$8,000.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the artists he's copied, Harvey says Chagall is the
hardest to master. ``He paints like a child. It's hard to put
yourself in the mind of a child.''
</P>
<P>
   And the easiest? It's Picasso, Harvey's favorite painter. ``When
you look at his work, you say, `Oh that's doesn't look hard,' ''
Harvey says. ``But you have to remember how long it took for him to
come up with that style. Copying is easy. Inventing is difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   The International Art Museum of Re-Creations is open 11 a.m.-5
p.m. Wednesdays-Fridays, 10 a.m.-6 p.m. Saturdays, 1-5 p.m.
Sundays. Adults, $4.50; groups, senior citizens and Hogansville,
Ga. residents, $3.50; students, $2.50; children ages 6 to 12, $1.
203 E. Main St. Hogansville, Ga. 706-637-8030.

 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
 &HT;    NEW YORK _ Whatever happened to Candlestick Park? Jack Murphy
Stadium? Or the Brendan Byrne Arena? The well-known sports venues,
in fact, are still there. But all three go by different monikers,
part of trend to bring cash to the franchises by selling out their
traditional names.
 &HT;    Candlestick Park, the home of the San Francisco Giants and
49ers, known to legions of devoted fans as ``The 'Stick,'' operates
under the drabbish banner of 3Com Park at Candlestick Point. San
Diego's Jack Murphy Stadium, named for a local sportswriter who
successfully crusaded for a professional football team, morphed
into Qualcomm Park. And the Brendan Byrne Arena in East Rutherford,
N.J., which honored the state's former governor, is called the
Continental Airlines Arena.
 &HT;    All three reaped hefty financial deals for turning over their
identities to the highest bidder.
 &HT;    Like many other aspects of professional sports, the stadiums
themselves have gone corporate and their old names have gone kaput.
Of 118 professional sports franchises in the four major team
sports, 63 now play in stadiums with corporate names, according to
the Chicago-based Team Marketing Report.
 &HT;    ``In ten years there may not be many major league facilities
left unnamed,'' said Sean Brenner, the trade publication's editor.
 &HT;    The money makes the change worth it, sports analysts say.
Multi-year deals of more than $100 million were won by seven
franchises that inked naming-rights agreements. Typically, naming
deals span about 20 years and can mean up to $5 million annually
for the biggest urban markets.
 &HT;    Many fans complain about revered personalities and club
tradition being replaced by the soulless, sterile logos of modern
techno-businesses. To these fans, stadium names should not sound
like synonyms for the title pages of corporate annual reports.
 &HT;    In New York, where both the Mets and the Yankees are eyeing the
windfall reaped by other stadiums and may soon carry corporate
labels, local fans wonder if the changes will alter the fan
experience.
 &HT;    ``People from all over the world come to Yankee Stadium,'' said
Mitchell Staub, a 23-year-old baseball fan. ``They don't want to
come to 'Yankee Yahoo Stadium.'''
 &HT;    For all the fuss, corporate influence is nothing new in stadium
names. In 1926, the Chicago Cubs named their ballpark Wrigley
Field, honoring William Wrigley Jr., the club's owner and chewing
gum magnate.
 &HT;    But most sports historians point to the Buffalo Bills' 1973 deal
with Rich Products Co. as the first example of selling a stadium
name.
 &HT;    Since then, sports analysts say, the ground rules have changed.
 &HT;    ``It used to be more about corporate philanthropy,'' said Matt
Brown, a professor of sports marketing at Ohio University. Today,
however, corporations ``don't do it unless there's a return on
their investment.''
 &HT;    For corporations like United Airlines, whose logo beams _
purists might say blasphemes _ from the roof of Chicago's
basketball and hockey arena, the deals can cement a company's
presence in a city. And, as with Boston's Fleet Center, home of the
Celtics and Bruins, exclusivity means that only Fleet Bank
automated teller machines are found inside the arena.
 &HT;    For smaller companies, such as 3Com, a northern California-based
developer of computer networks, the benefits can boost stock prices
and the company's overall profile.
 &HT;    Soon to fall will be Tiger Stadium in Detroit. When the Tigers
wrap up their season this fall, they will bid farewell to their
77-year-old ballpark where hometown fans once cheered Hall of
Famers Ty Cobb, Hank Greenberg and Al Kaline.
 &HT;    Next season the Tigers will move into the spanking new Comerica
Park, sponsored by Detroit's 150-year-old bank. Comerica, which
ponied up $66 million to attach its name to the stadium for 30
years, will be the team's ``official bank,'' supply the stadium
with four bank machines and air several television and radio spots
during Tiger telecasts.
 &HT;    ``It was a once in a 30-year opportunity,'' said spokesman Wayne
Mielke of Comerica.
 &HT;    Most fans now seem to accept the corporate names as inescapable
elements of modern sports. These same corporations wrap their
images around college football bowl games, plaster advertising on
the shirts of tennis stars and spend millions for the privilege of
advertising during the Super Bowl.
 &HT;    ``It's really becoming almost a non-issue as the trend has
continued,'' said Team Marketing Report's Brenner. ``With each new
deal comes along less and less backlash.''
 &HT;    That may be true, but fans like Matt Kreinces, a Garden City,
N.Y., lawyer, still don't like it.
 &HT;    ``I don't understand why we can't use people's names,'' he said.

WINE EXPERT TEACHES NOVICES TO BE CONNOISSEURS

 By ERIK LINDEN  
 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
 &HT;    NEW YORK _ Swishing a mouthful of Cabernet Piave, the man on a
mission to demystify wines spits and then grins. ``This is getting
weird,'' says Willie Gluckstern, a 19-year veteran of hosting wine
classes in New York City. ``This is a strange Cabernet.''
 &HT;    Dressed in an olive suit, the 6-foot-4-inch Gluckstern then asks
his four wine pouring assistants _ all charming women in their 20s
_ to hand out Peranno cheese to class members.
 &HT;    ``Cheese is the great equalizer,'' Gluckstern explains to the
group of 50 novice wine tasters participating in a class on Italian
wines at the Park Central hotel in Manhattan. ``You take the worst
crap in a glass and it tastes great with cheese.''
 &HT;    In a city where wine classes are myriad and it is hip to sniff
out the best, Gluckstern is a voice unlike any other. Gluckstern
encourages people to go beyond jug wines, to avoid overexposed
brands advertised on billboards or television, and to explore wines
from smaller vineyards.
 &HT;    Perhaps Gluckstern helped start a trend. Last year, Americans
began to abandon jug wines mass produced by the large wine
corporations in favor of smaller vintages, according to Gladys
Horiuchi of the San Francisco-based Wine Institute. ``Part of that
is the fact that consumers are becoming more knowledgeable about
wines,'' says Horiuchi.
 &HT;    It's all part of a surge in wine sales in the past two decades.
In 1997, Americans drank $16 billion worth of wine, compared with
only $6 billion in 1980.
 &HT;    Gluckstern is thrilled to see the numbers rise. And he doesn't
mind cashing in at the same time. Last summer, Gluckstern wrote
``The Wine Avenger'' (Simon and Schuster), a book filled with tips
and witty wisdom. Born in New York City, Gluckstern acquired a
taste for wine from his father, who once managed Knickerbocker
Liquors, a wine wholesaler.
 &HT;    ``He piqued my interest,'' Gluckstern says of his father. ``He

fact that a wine can make it to an old age,'' says Gluckstern,

 &HT;    ``Chardonnays are a joke,'' says Gluckstern, who vilifies
American winemakers for pumping up their pallid grapes with
additives like oak chips. The wine has become a smash success only
because people have grown accustomed to the wooden oak flavor. They
also like the name. Chardonnay is easy to pronounce.
 &HT;    Not so, says Harriet Lembeck, director of the Wines and Spirits
program in Manhattan. ``I wouldn't say that most Chardonnays are
over-oaked,'' says Lembeck, who is also wine director for the New

   NEW YORK _ Swishing a mouthful of Cabernet Piave, the man on a
mission to demystify wines spits and then grins. ``This is getting
weird,'' says Willie Gluckstern, a 19-year veteran of hosting wine
classes in New York City. ``This is a strange Cabernet.''
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in an olive suit, the 6-foot-4-inch Gluckstern then asks
his four wine pouring assistants _ all charming women in their 20s
_ to hand out Peranno cheese to class members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheese is the great equalizer,'' Gluckstern explains to the
group of 50 novice wine tasters participating in a class on Italian
wines at the Park Central hotel in Manhattan. ``You take the worst
crap in a glass and it tastes great with cheese.''
</P>
<P>
   In a city where wine classes are myriad and it is hip to sniff
out the best, Gluckstern is a voice unlike any other. Gluckstern
encourages people to go beyond jug wines, to avoid overexposed
brands advertised on billboards or television, and to explore wines
from smaller vineyards.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Gluckstern helped start a trend. Last year, Americans
began to abandon jug wines mass produced by the large wine
corporations in favor of smaller vintages, according to Gladys
Horiuchi of the San Francisco-based Wine Institute. ``Part of that
is the fact that consumers are becoming more knowledgeable about
wines,'' says Horiuchi.
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of a surge in wine sales in the past two decades.
In 1997, Americans drank $16 billion worth of wine, compared with
only $6 billion in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Gluckstern is thrilled to see the numbers rise. And he doesn't
mind cashing in at the same time. Last summer, Gluckstern wrote
``The Wine Avenger'' (Simon and Schuster), a book filled with tips
and witty wisdom. Born in New York City, Gluckstern acquired a
taste for wine from his father, who once managed Knickerbocker
Liquors, a wine wholesaler.
</P>
<P>
   ``He piqued my interest,'' Gluckstern says of his father. ``He
told me tales of the wine trade and about rare, long forgotten
vintages.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, Gluckstern wrote material for stand-up
comedians and started his ``Wines for Food'' classes, which teach
novices how to pick the right wines to accompany various foods.
These days, Gluckstern runs a Web site _ wineavenger.com _ and is

GOURMET BEANS CAUSE INSTANT A 'LATTE' TROUBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

 By BRAD FOSS  
 c.1999 Columbia News Service  
 &HT;    NEW YORK _ As Americans spend more time and money sipping
gourmet and specialty coffees in European-style cafes, they are
turning their backs on the less costly, less time-consuming _ and,
some argue, less tasty _ beverage made from the same bean.
 &HT;    The heyday for instant coffee in this country _ during the late
1970s _ is over. Its percentage of total U.S. coffee consumption
dropped from 13 percent in 1991 to just 9 percent by 1996, an
overall decline of 30 percent.
 &HT;    Sales overseas, however, are percolating. While the 10 million
people who still drink freeze-dried, agglomerated and crystallized
java have become a minority in this country, the worldwide
prospects for instant coffee are excellent.
 &HT;    Despite slumping sales here, instant coffee, also known as
soluble, accounts for roughly half of all consumption worldwide,
according to the Tea and Coffee Trade Journal. For instance,
instant makes up roughly 90 percent of that slurped in England and
Russia. Some former Soviet-bloc countries have similarly high rates
of consumption, and the continents of Asia and Australia are
considered the next frontiers for instant coffee manufacturers and
distributors.
 &HT;    But while instant coffee makers seek to develop new markets,
they understand that a country's palate sometimes changes when its
economy improves. ``All of the developing countries drink soluble
coffee first,'' said Jane McCabe, editor at the Tea and Coffee
Trade Journal. ``Then they switch over to roasted ground coffee.''
 &HT;    Indeed, there is some debate about the potential life span of
instant coffee once it is introduced into any country. ``People
don't like the taste,'' McCabe said. ``Once they find roasted
ground, they stick with that.''
 &HT;    On the other hand, there is some hope within the industry that
the preference for instant might be more than a passing phase in
England, Russia and some Eastern European countries. Instant is
judged by more stringent minimum standards before it is sold in
countries other than the United States, said Susan Korry, who
trades coffee worldwide for the Rothfos Corp., a division of
Neumann Kaffee Gruppe, based in Hamburg, Germany.
 &HT;    ``They have quality products shipped in,'' she said. ``Whereas
here in the United States, we don't have that type of testing.
 &HT;    ``There are products on the shelf'' in the United States, Korry
said, ``which state that they're 100 percent coffee and they're
not. There might be a bean of coffee in it.'' By allowing goods of
inferior quality in supermarkets, she said, America has ``ruined''
a once $2 billion a year industry.
 &HT;    During the 1980s, when quality and sales started to slip,
Americans began to sample gourmet ground coffee in significant
numbers. Since 1991, the number of cafes devoted to the brew in
this country has grown from 500 to more than 7,000. The number of
occasional drinkers grew by 20 million last year, according to a
recent study by the National Coffee Association. As the
association's spokesman, Gary Goldstein, explained, ``You know,
people who will go out for a double cappuccino.''
 &HT;    Quantifying the precise effect all this has had on overall
coffee drinking habits can be misleading.. For one thing, specialty
drinks such as mochas, lattes and frappuccinos contain a
considerable amount of milk and sweeteners, which can be more of an
enticement than the coffee flavors in these concoctions.
 &HT;    And while there may be more Americans enjoying these frothy
drinks, their consumption is more restrained than that of coffee
drinkers 20 years ago, who used to polish off several cups a day,
said McCabe of the coffee trade journal. Offsetting this decline,
of course, is the fact that today's consumers are willing to pay
more than $3 for trendy specialty drinks.
 &HT;    Instant coffee may be on the decline as a traditional beverage.
But, Korry said, it is growing as an ingredient in bakery products,
candies, ice cream and capuccino vending machines nationwide.
 &HT;    Indeed, the meteoric growth of the gourmet and specialty coffees
is not a total disaster for instant coffee drinkers. Korry said
that in order to maintain a presence on supermarket shelves,
companies that sell instant coffee in this country have begun to
pay closer attention to the quality and taste of their products.
 &HT;    As Grace Torbus, president of Tonex Inc., which distributes its
instant coffee internationally and in the United States, explained,
``When people take a coffee break, they want to feel like they went
out to a fine restaurant or had a gourmet dessert.''

 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
 &HT;    NEW YORK _ From behind bags of trash, a dozen cat eyes gleam in
the weak beam of a sweeping flashlight. Though a locked steel gate
blocks the abandoned railroad tunnel in Manhattan's Riverside Park,
someone had slipped seven pie plates, now empty, through the rusty
bars. An eighth plate was full of kibble.
 &HT;    Few people realize it, but New York is overrun with wild and
stray cats. Seven and a half million people share the city with 1.5
million to 2 million homeless cats, according to the New York
Association for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which served
as city dogcatcher until 1995. Cats have been domesticated for
8,000 years, but trust and friendliness wear off quickly on the
mean streets. Strays become skittish and surly. Many alley cats are
completely feral _ wild animals, born on the streets, with no trust
for humans.
 &HT;    ``It is not a minor attitude problem,'' said Ira Manhoff, who
rents a basement space where he tries to get cats to ``come
around,'' or adjust to human contact. He works with five cats at a
time, and the taming process can take months. Often, it takes weeks
of petting with a back-scratcher before a cat will allow Manhoff to
use his hands. A ``floral essence remedy'' in the water dish
soothes the patient's frazzled nerves.
 &HT;    ``They are terrified,'' Manhoff said. ``They have suffered at
the hands of humans, and now they are reacting to it.''
 &HT;    Manhoff's group, Manhattan Valley Cat Rescue, has 20 reformed
feral cats in foster homes, hopefully the final step before
adoption. It is one of dozens of small animal rescue organizations
in the city. Most are groups of friends who focus on removing
kittens from the street while they are still impressionable, and
putting them up for adoption at pet stores. The ASPCA has a list of
16 organizations, and pet store inquiries produced several more.
 &HT;    In the wild, cats live in colonies, preferring dark, enclosed
spaces where hiding is easy. A railroad tunnel does well, or the
space under a construction trailer. Colonies of 60 cats are not
unusual, and as many as 100 cats are said to live together in
abandoned buildings on Manhattan's northern tip. Left to their own
devices, cats become nocturnal and secretive. Colonies form
quickly. Cats multiply at an astonishing rate _ at a litter of
eight every eight months, two cats could beget 2 million in six
years' time.
 &HT;    Feral cats may lose every domestic impulse, but never the love
for good food and a nice bowl of milk. Rescue workers say that most
wild cat colonies are supported by human ``feeders.''
 &HT;    ``They are going to go where there is food, and it is not going
to be rats and mice and birds,'' said Holly Staver, president of
the rescue group City Critters. ``There are feeders on every
block.''
 &HT;    The colony of nine cats in the Riverside Park tunnel are fed
every morning at 5 a.m. by a neighborhood woman, known as ``the cat
lady'' to denizens of the park. The people who live in the park
also help support the colony.
 &HT;    ``A lot of us, we pick up cans so the cats stay full,'' said
J.R., who lives in the park and declined to give his last name.
``We take care of them real good.''
 &HT;    For a few people, caring for cats has become a passion. With so
many needy cats out there, sympathetic humans can be overwhelmed.
 &HT;    ``I'm going broke with this thing,'' said Mary Zawada, a textile
designer who spends weekends trapping pregnant cats so their
kittens can be adopted. Lately, Zawada has been spending all of her
spare time nursing a sick kitten that needed $600 worth of
veterinary care when she picked it up off the street two weeks ago.
``My credit cards just revolve and revolve,'' she said.
 &HT;    Cats demand a certain punctuality and feeders learn to be on
time.
 &HT;    ``Time is very important to them,'' said Manhoff, who was
anxious to leave the house to be on time for his feeding
appointments. ``These are cats who don't have very much to regulate
their lives on,'' said Manhoff, adding that if he's a few minutes
late, ``the next thing you know, they are wandering around and
crossing the street and everything.''
 &HT;    The most ambitious rescuers pursue a ``trap-neuter-release''
policy. City Critters, a rescue group which raised $75,000 this
year for the cause, captures 500 wild cats each year. All the cats
are neutered and given shots, and the ones that are too wild to be
adopted are returned to their old colonies on the street.
 &HT;    The New York Center for Animal Control and Care has no problems
with rescue groups putting sterilized feral cats back on the
street. ``We are not in a position to round up all of the
animals,'' said Kyle Burkhart, director of external affairs. ``If
they spay and neuter, then we are grateful and it helps a lot.''
 &HT;    In general, the city turns a cold shoulder to its wild cat
population: they pose few health risks to humans, and in general,
only attack when cornered by a stranger. One receptionist at New
York City Center for Animal and Human Bites said she receives more
phone calls regarding human bites than cat bites.
 &HT;    Even if you are bit, it probably won't be serious, said Barbara
Null, a public health epidemiologist at the bite center. The only
disease cats carry that is transmissible to humans is rabies, and
there hasn't been a case of rabies in New York City for 20 years.
 &HT;    Budget concerns as they are, the Center for Animal Control and
Care only bothers with feral cats when neighbors complain, Burkhart
said
 &HT;    ``We get calls constantly regarding packs of wild dogs in Queens
and Brooklyn, but I can't think of a single complaint regarding
cats,'' Burkhart said. ``They tend to keep to themselves.''

abandoned buildings on Manhattan's northern tip. Left to their own
devices, cats become nocturnal and secretive. Colonies form
quickly. Cats multiply at an astonishing rate _ at a litter of
eight every eight months, two cats could beget 2 million in six
years' time.
</P>
<P>
   Feral cats may lose every domestic impulse, but never the love
for good food and a nice bowl of milk. Rescue workers say that most
wild cat colonies are supported by human ``feeders.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are going to go where there is food, and it is not going
to be rats and mice and birds,'' said Holly Staver, president of
the rescue group City Critters. ``There are feeders on every
block.''
</P>
<P>
   The colony of nine cats in the Riverside Park tunnel are fed
every morning at 5 a.m. by a neighborhood woman, known as ``the cat
lady'' to denizens of the park. The people who live in the park
also help support the colony.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us, we pick up cans so the cats stay full,'' said
J.R., who lives in the park and declined to give his last name.
``We take care of them real good.''
</P>
<P>
   For a few people, caring for cats has become a passion. With so
many needy cats out there, sympathetic humans can be overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going broke with this thing,'' said Mary Zawada, a textile
designer who spends weekends trapping pregnant cats so their
kittens can be adopted. Lately, Zawada has been spending all of her
spare time nursing a sick kitten that needed $600 worth of
veterinary care when she picked it up off the street two weeks ago.
``My credit cards just revolve and revolve,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cats demand a certain punctuality and feeders learn to be on
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is very important to them,'' said Manhoff, who was
anxious to leave the house to be on time for his feeding
appointments. ``These are cats who don't have very much to regulate
their lives on,'' said Manhoff, adding that if he's a few minutes
late, ``the next thing you know, they are wandering around and
crossing the street and everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The most ambitious rescuers pursue a ``trap-neuter-release''
policy. City Critters, a rescue group which raised $75,000 this
year for the cause, captures 500 wild cats each year. All the cats
are neutered and given shots, and the ones that are too wild to be
adopted are returned to their old colonies on the street.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Center for Animal Control and Care has no problems
with rescue groups putting sterilized feral cats back on the
street. ``We are not in a position to round up all of the
animals,'' said Kyle Burkhart, director of external affairs. ``If
they spay and neuter, then we are grateful and it helps a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, the city turns a cold shoulder to its wild cat
population: they pose few health risks to humans, and in general,
only attack when cornered by a stranger. One receptionist at New
York City Center for Animal and Human Bites said she receives more
phone calls regarding human bites than cat bites.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you are bit, it probably won't be serious, said Barbara
Null, a public health epidemiologist at the bite center. The only
disease cats carry that is transmissible to humans is rabies, and
there hasn't been a case of rabies in New York City for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Budget concerns as they are, the Center for Animal Control and
Care only bothers with feral cats when neighbors complain, Burkhart
said
</P>
<P>
   ``We get calls constantly regarding packs of wild dogs in Queens
and Brooklyn, but I can't think of a single complaint regarding
cats,'' Burkhart said. ``They tend to keep to themselves.''

   ROMANCE BOOKS _ The general book market may be slumping, but
romance novels are flying off the shelves faster than the racing

percent of the entire book market.

<P>
   CLINTON ENVIRONMENT _ When environmentalists consider the
Clinton legacy, they see big strides coupled with missed
opportunities. The overall direction, they say, is positive. Yet a
Republican-dominated Congress and an administration diverted by
scandals and international conflicts have kept the environmental
agenda from enjoying the prominence they had expected under
Clinton.

   INSTANT COFFEE _ The heyday for instant coffee in this country _
during the late 1970s _ is over. Its percentage of total U.S.
coffee consumption dropped from 13 percent in 1991 to just 9
percent by 1996, an overall decline of 30 percent. But sales
overseas are percolating.
</P>

   FERAL CATS _ Seven and a half million people share the city with
1.5 million to 2 million homeless cats, according to the New York
Association for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Cats have
been domesticated for 8,000 years, but trust and friendliness wear

 &HT;    Tall Tales and Short Stories: Ugly story with a beautiful ending
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's an ugly story told by a beautiful woman . . .
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband had been married 17 years. One day it
occurred to her he no longer seemed to notice her.
</P>
<P>
   She cut her hair. He didn't notice.
</P>
<P>
   She made her hair blonde. He didn't notice.
</P>
<P>
   She decided to go on a diet. She walked two miles every day and
counted every calorie until she lost 30 pounds and looked like a
refugee from a labor camp. Still, he didn't notice.
</P>
<P>
   One thing never she never considered: perhaps he was seeing
someone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had lined up 100 men, he would have been the last one I
would have thought would cheat,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It just never occurred to her.
</P>
<P>
   Not even when he started having his nails done.
</P>
<P>
   Not even when he started wearing black brief underwear.
</P>
<P>
   Not even when she happened to see their phone bill for more than
$800.
</P>
<P>
   She seldom dealt with the bills. Moreover, the mail came while
she was at work.
</P>
<P>
   When she asked him about the hundreds of dollars in long
distance calls _ most of them, she noticed, to a number somewhere
out West _ he told her it was all a mistake on the part of the
people at the phone company, that he had already talked to them and
they had corrected the bill.
</P>
<P>
   What she didn't know was that he immediately went out and got a
post office box. That's where the phone bill went from then on.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, this illicit love affair had been phone fascination from
the first.
</P>
<P>
   The way he would explain it to her _ when he was asking her for
a divorce _ is that he had accidentally dialed a wrong area code, a
woman answered, told him he had wrong number and then they hung up.
</P>
<P>
   He had stood there a long moment, all atwitter, then picked up
the phone again and punched redial.
</P>
<P>
   He knew from the first time he heard her voice she was the woman
he had always wanted.
</P>
<P>
   After they had separated, his wife would call the number herself
just out of curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the very least I expected something husky and sexy, like
Debra Winger,'' she said. ``Instead I got this awful, whiny
``Hel-lo'' that sounded like a hillbilly girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, she wasn't much more than a girl, just 20 years old,
but married with two children, having gotten an early start after
getting pregnant out of wedlock at 15.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. This was her husband's one true love. Nothing would
do but for them to divorce.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that they split their stuff, he took cash _ most of
which had come from her inheritance _ and she took the property.
</P>
<P>
   He gave up a good job where they lived in the East to move to
Arkansas to make about one-fourth the money he had been earning.
</P>
<P>
   All's well that ends well?
</P>
<P>
   Well, it has been for the wife he left behind.
</P>
<P>
   She met someone new in no time at all _ a man tall and handsome,
rich and powerful _ and, in no time at all, they were married.
She's everything he ever wanted, and she's never been so happy.
</P>
<P>
   As for the husband that went away, it turned out the love of his
life couldn't see spending the rest of her life with him.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, you can't live on love _ and her own husband makes a
lot more money than the he does.
</P>
<P>
   He wishes now he was back in the home he abandoned _ not that
she would ever have him back or, for that matter, that he could
afford a ticket back.
</P>
<P>
   All that money he went away with has since gone away, and he's
stone broke and broken-hearted to boot.
</P>
<P>
   She has her hair back to brown, she's wearing it long again and,
at her husband's insistence, has gained some of the weight she
lost. Everyone tells her she's never looked more lovely.
</P>
<P>
   Moral: Even an ugly story can have a beautiful ending.

   GONDOLAS (Oakland, Calif.) _ In the culture wars around here,

cruises (with candles! antipasto! O Sole Mio!). By ROBERT SELNA.
</P>
<P>
   GOOD-POSTURE (Albany, N.Y.) _ Today's sedentary lifestyle often
aggravates many poor-posture problems. With many people spending
eight or more hours at a desk every day, typing at computers and
answering the phone, it's easier than ever to slump and

   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   LYNCH-COLUMN (Albany, N.Y.) _ There will be those cynical types
who'll maintain that New York Gov. George Pataki is backing Texas
Gov. George W. Bush early in the hope that Bush, overcome with
gratitude, will pick the New Yorker as a running mate. Don't bet on
it. Sure, New York has 33 electoral votes. But Pataki couldn't even
find enough room on his coattails last year for former Attorney
General Dennis Vacco and former U.S. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato. By DAN
LYNCH.
</P>

   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Rashad Williams has had a day

crime. By STEPHANIE SALTER.

   For a week now, I've been nibbling on my nails. What was this
big announcement that George Pataki had scheduled? Given the
governor's penchant for lying low _ he's about as visible in this
town as Claude Rains or Chevy Chase _ why had he made such a
production about his news conference on Monday. What could he
possibly have on his mind?
</P>
<P>
   Would he take on New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani for next year's
Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate? Would that be cool or
what? A big, bloody battle of the titans in New York's Republican
Party? Thank you, God.
</P>
<P>
   Or was he going to resign his office to take some big job
somewhere in private industry? That would leave Lt. Gov. Mary
Donahue as governor and spark a huge, deliciously vicious fight in
the party in 2002. Given Pataki's obvious disinterest in serving as
governor, that hardly seemed unlikely. Or despite the lukewarm
response to his year-long speeches to GOP organizations around the
country, was he announcing his candidacy for the Republican
presidential nomination anyway? Was he going to say, ``All right,
the hell with it. This is my chance. I'm going to let it all hang
out.''
</P>
<P>
   People do that sometimes _ even buttoned-down, uptight,
exceedingly proper Yalies like Pataki. They buy sailboats and light
out for Tahiti. They ditch their wives for cabaret singers named
Bambi. They run for president. Really, you never know.
</P>
<P>
   So I don't mind saying that I was absolutely quivery as Monday
drew near. As a political junkie _ as somebody with a ferocious,
frenzied interest in the democratic process and in the quirky
personalities that make it work _ I just couldn't wait to find out
what was on Pataki's mind.
</P>
<P>
   And what did it turn out to be? In a stunning act of political
courage, the governor announced Monday that he's backing the
front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination. Yes, the
governor says, Texas Gov. George W. Bush is his kind of guy.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there's a thrill. Next thing you know, Pataki will be
wearing brown shoes with a blue suit. Is there any limit to this
guy's flair for nonconformity?
</P>
<P>
   OK, I suppose it's possible that Bush will not end up as next
year's Republican presidential candidate. There could be some
scandal involving booze, drugs or a bevy of, ahem, debutantes. In
the end, Bush could be the guy who ends up sailing to Tahiti with
Bambi.
</P>
<P>
   Odds are, though, that Bush will be the man next year, and it's
not the biggest deal in the world that establishment Republicans
like Pataki end up endorsing him. For somebody like Pataki, an act
like that isn't exactly on a par with abandoning public service and
going on tour with Bob Dylan.
</P>
<P>
   There will, of course, be those cynical types who'll maintain
that Pataki is backing Bush early in the hope that Bush, overcome
with gratitude, will pick him as a running mate. Don't bet on it.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, New York has 33 electoral votes. But Pataki has
demonstrated that he would be unlikely to deliver them to Bush in a
presidential year. He couldn't even find enough room on his
coattails in New York last year for Attorney General Dennis Vacco
and Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, both of whom lost to Democratic
challengers.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush ends up as the GOP nominee, he's much likelier to look
to a Californian as a running mate, or to a woman. Or to
Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, who has a reasonable shot at
delivering his state's 23 electoral votes next year.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki didn't back Bush because of personal gain.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly he did it because this is his idea of excitement.

`PRIVATE RYAN' COMES INTO PERSPECTIVE ON VIDEO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This year wasn't the first time, and _ based on
their record _ it probably won't be the last time that Academy of
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences members make a mistake when naming
the best picture. At least ``Shakespeare in Love'' was a
commendable, if lightweight, choice. It was certainly better than
some of the boring, ``prestigious'' epics that have won in the
past, but it was hardly as cinematic, moving or thought-provoking
as its chief rival, ``Saving Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   Before you protest, ``Ryan,'' which comes out on video today,
isn't a perfect film, but unlike ``Shakespeare,'' it aimed higher
and succeeded _ sometimes brilliantly. The scenes of the landing at
Omaha Beach on D-Day are unmatched in film, an extraordinary
sequence that few directors could pull off, which is why Steven
Spielberg rightly won the Oscar for best director and the film
picked up four other Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   (If there is any consolation for losing the best picture Oscar,
``Ryan'' was last year's box-office champ, taking in more than $210
million.)
</P>
<P>
   But the film is more than just pyrotechnics and technique. If
``Ryan'' was merely an homage to the fighting men in World War II _
like numerous flag-waving combat movies have been _ then that
wouldn't be enough to make it a great film. The war drama tells the
story of a platoon led by Capt. Miller (Tom Hanks) to rescue a
family's last surviving son (Matt Damon), after his brothers had
been killed in combat. In doing so, it raises questions about
courage, sacrifice and morality that resonate throughout the film,
giving it a true poignancy.
</P>
<P>
   On the small screen, ``Ryan'' loses little of its impact. But
video viewers can distance themselves from some of the more
harrowing scenes, which were very intense on the big screen, and,
ironically, that might have offered them some perspective to
appreciate the film's exceptional qualities.
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks has set ``Ryan'' as a rental only, though there
should be plenty of copies in the stores. No sell-through date has
been announced, and there are no plans for a DVD version at this
time.
</P>
<P>
   Just a thought: The largest segment of the voting members of the
academy are actors (about one-fourth), and an actors' film
(``Shakespeare'') won this year. Maybe they forgot that they aren't
voting for the Screen Actors Guild awards. It is, after all, the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

BEST ADVICE FOR CREDIT USERS: BEWARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDWARD IWATA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ With the economic boom and wild spending
continuing, the credit card may be Public Enemy No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Never before has it been so easy to buy so much stuff and to
fall into such deep debt. Credit card debt rose at a near-record
pace to $1.3 trillion in January, the Federal Reserve reported.
</P>
<P>
   Personal bankruptcies hit a record high of 1.4 million last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Feeding the frenzy are the nation's credit card issuers, who are
flooding mailboxes with billions of tempting offers. Consumer
groups accuse them of deceptive marketing and sales practices.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and lawmakers hope to curb some of the
problems by requiring issuers to clearly disclose their fees and
terms to customers.
</P>
<P>
   With all the potential pitfalls out there, what's a poor shopper
to do? Here are some tips:
</P>
<P>
   _ Buyer beware.
</P>
<P>
   Many tricky marketing tactics used by respectable credit card
issuers are perfectly legal. It's up to consumers to train their
brains to study important information hidden deep in written
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   For direct mail solicitations, the fees and interest rates can
all be found in one place: a graph box on the mailing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is to really read all the fine print,'' said Linda
Sherry, editorial director at Consumer Action in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ignore telemarketing calls.
</P>
<P>
   Good telemarketers are well trained and use scripts to respond
to objections about buying a product. ``Telemarketers are out to
confuse you,'' Sherry said. ``Avoid buying things from them.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Teaser rates are dangerous traps.
</P>
<P>
   In a common sales ploy, credit card issuers offer introductory
teaser rates of 0 percent to 5 or 6 percent for the first few
months of a new account. Later, the rate suddenly jumps to 16 or 20
percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   Often, the full rate is a variable rate pegged to an economic
indicator or index set by the Federal Reserve, U.S. Treasury bills
or other benchmarks. The formula can confuse consumers, who are
shocked when they're hit by the big interest rate down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teaser rates will be in big print,'' said Gail Hillebrand,
legal counsel at Consumers Union in San Francisco. ``Make sure you
know what the full terms will be.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Ask credit agencies to delete you from their mailing lists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't cut off the solicitations 100 percent, but it'll
substantially reduce the flow,'' said David Medine, associate
director for credit practices at the Federal Trade Commission in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   _ Watch out for ``free'' checks in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   Another potent sales trick: Some credit card issuers will send
you a blank check that's really a cash advance on your new credit
card account. The credit card company hits you twice: You pay a 2
or 3 percent fee on the advance, as well as interest on the
outstanding balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like a check. You fill it out like a check, and you
spend it like a check, but it's really an advance authorization on
your account,'' Hillebrand said. ``The best thing to do is tear it
up.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Trash extra credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need more than one or two for travel, emergency
purchases or big-ticket items.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because it's being offered to you doesn't mean it's a
good idea,'' Hillebrand said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Be careful when you move your balance to another credit card
issuer.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to find the lower interest rates, millions of people are
shopping around and transferring their credit card balances to
another credit card company or bank. The new company pays off the
old balance, then offers consumers the new, lower rate.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure you understand all of the terms of the transfer.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers often are socked by hidden fees and terms. Also, never
agree to transfer your balance over the phone. Make sure the terms
are in writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stay alert because credit card issuers dangle a lot of carrots
in front of consumers,'' Sherry said.

DISTANCE RUNNER GOES ALL THE WAY FOR LITTLETON 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Monday was Rashad Williams Day in San Francisco.
I celebrated it by going to City Hall to see the young man get a
proclamation from the mayor for raising $14,000 for Lance Kirklin,
who was badly wounded in the shooting at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Rashad Williams made my day, and a lot of people's days, by
deciding to do something about the Littleton massacre while we
adults were just talking about it.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked Rashad's grandmother, Minnie Burton, how the family
was going to celebrate Rashad Williams Day, she said, ``We're going
back to school.''
</P>
<P>
   No lunch at a fancy restaurant for this family. Three
generations of them are committed to work, education and doing good
for others. Rashad had to get back to Archbishop Riordan High
School to finish the school year. It's a privilege when you think
about it.
</P>
<P>
   Kirklin didn't get to finish his sophomore year at Littleton
High School. Kirklin spent a month in the Denver Health Center
recovering from multiple gunshot wounds to the chest and legs, as
well as a shotgun blast that tore up his face.
</P>
<P>
   Few expected this 16-year-old to live. But after holding a news
conference and participating in a party for the trauma unit's
doctors, donors and former patients, he went home a few days ago.
Still, he faces years of reconstructive surgery and it won't all be
covered by insurance.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Rashad, a 15-year-old a thousand miles away, decided
to run the Bay to Breakers race to raise the money to help him. So
far he has raised $14,000.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan Vice Principal Linda Nastari says kids are still
bringing nickels, dimes and quarters for the wounded kid in
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   The school is still accepting checks made out to the Lance
Kirklin Support Fund c/o Everen Securities, at Riordan High School,
175 Phelan Ave., San Francisco, CA 94112.
</P>
<P>
   Rashad is long on action and short on talk, so when he spoke in
front of four news cameras in the mayor's office, he simply said:
``I just did it for Lance. I was just devastated and I decided to
help.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Willie Brown said he was happy to see the news media turn
out for a student trying to help another student, and hoped it
would be an example for all teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most times coverage (of teen-agers) is for something not so
positive,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   It's true, and when Rashad's mother, Shirley Burton-Harrison,
told me two weeks ago that her son was actually doing something
about Littleton, I drove right out to Riordan High to meet the
young man.
</P>
<P>
   Like most Americans, I felt angry, depressed and frustrated
about what happened at Columbine High School. I didn't want to go
to Littleton or contribute to the media binge that seems to inspire
copycat shooters.
</P>
<P>
   Along came Rashad, a kid I hope will inspire copycats who do
good rather than evil.
</P>
<P>
   Don't call them copycats, though. Most kids are good to begin
with, and have their own ways of expressing it. They just need a
little inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   A family can be the best inspiration, and upon meeting Rashad's
family at City Hall, I understood where he gets his generous
impulses.
</P>
<P>
   When I shook hands with Mack Burton, Rashad's grandfather, he
pulled me aside to say he hopes what Rashad said about Lance to his
mother can be a motto for change.
</P>
<P>
   ``As adults,'' Burton said, ``we can make sure everybody hears,
`Mom, that could have been me. I only have my heart and my legs.'''
</P>
<P>
   Burton, a former football star for Washington High School here,
has the legs and the heart, too. Through his company, Burton
Construction Services and the Residential Builders Association, he
is teaching construction skills to dozens of the poor of all
descriptions, including homeless people and former substance
abusers.
</P>
<P>
   Burton's bright hope is his grandson Rashad, and kids like him,
are all our hopes.
</P>
<P>
   After the ceremony, life went on. Rashad Williams went back to
school. I gave his mom Lance Kirklin's e-mail address, kindly
supplied by the hospital. Rashad will send Lance a note. Maybe
these two quiet kids will communicate. Maybe they'll meet.
</P>
<P>
   You never know. Sometimes life provides good surprises.
</P>

POLICE SAY NOT ALL ARE WELCOME IN TOURIST MECCA 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ A city of contrasts.
</P>
<P>
   Well-heeled tourists saunter into an Alamo Plaza boutique.
</P>
<P>
   A young couple smile for a photograph in front of the Shrine of
Texas Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street, in the shadow of the Alamo Cenotaph, a
homeless woman gazes out of a Burger King window, mumbling and
giggling to herself. Three plastic bags, containing her worldly
possessions, rest at her feet.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the nation's premiere tourist destinations, San
Antonio has found itself in an uncomfortable predicament: Keeping
streets clean and safe for tourists without trampling the rights of
those who could frighten them away.
</P>
<P>
   Tattooed teen-agers slouch in front of trendy tourist shops.
</P>
<P>
   Horses pull white carriages past soiled street people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go to the River Walk and the police run us off. They say
the backpacks scare off the tourists,'' said James Smith, a
21-year-old drifter with dirty clothes and a silver stud in his
chin. ``They tell us, `If you're out of sight, you're OK.'''
</P>
<P>
   How far the city has gone to sanitize downtown has been the
subject of hours of contentious testimony in a federal court
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   A San Antonio police officer has said he was ordered to drive
out homeless people, teen-agers and other so-called
``undesirables.''
</P>
<P>
   Officer Onofre Serna also has said in a lawsuit filed in U.S.
District Court that the Police Department retaliated against him
because he objected to the orders.
</P>
<P>
   Serna, who in 1996 was transferred from the highly visible
bicycle patrol to squad-car duty, says the transfer was punishment
for complaining about the unit's harsh methods. He also says the
transfer violated his civil rights and laws protecting
whistleblowers.
</P>
<P>
   In recent testimony, nine officers said that between 1994 and
1996 they were ordered to snatch bandannas, baseball caps and other
personal belongings from suspected gang members; to remove homeless
people from benches and doorways; and to demand identification from
patrons of some bars.
</P>
<P>
   The city denies it ever took aim at particular categories of
people or retaliated against Serna.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't target people, we target problems,'' Mayor Howard
Peak said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're not doing anything wrong, they shouldn't be
hassled. If a problem is created, it should be dealt with.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, Chicago, New York, San Francisco and Tucson, Ariz., are
among dozens of U.S. cities that have tried to restrict the
homeless from certain downtown areas in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome of the San Antonio trial, no one denies a
lot is at stake. Nearly 8 million visitors spent an estimated $1.72
billion in San Antonio in 1997, making tourism the city's second
largest industry, according to the Convention and Visitor's Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   The yearly economic impact of tourism here is estimated at $3.51
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The River Walk, with its 150 upscale restaurants, hotels and
bars, is Texas' No. 1 tourist destination.
</P>
<P>
   The flood of tourists onto the streets of San Antonio, a city of
1 million people, has been accompanied by a smaller but growing
stream of homeless people.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1997 and 1998, the city's homeless population jumped 23
percent, to 22,155 people, according to officials at the San
Antonio Metropolitan Ministry, which operates an emergency shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews suggest an uneasy co-existence between those who
profit from the tourist industry and those who merely live
alongside it.
</P>
<P>
   Rosalinda Brinson, a sales clerk at a jewelry store overlooking
the River Walk called Minas de Taxco, put it this way: ``It's a
very big problem. Some people come in and they have hair on one
side but not on the other.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very scary,'' she said. ``I can take it, but the families
with the little girls, they don't want to come back to San
Antonio.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Gallaspy, executive director of the Paseo del Rio
Association, an alliance of 150 River Walk businesses, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That type of stuff can be detrimental to the tourist
industry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can have a huge impact. Our mission statement is to
promote, protect and preserve the River Walk at all costs. We have
to do everything to ensure that that continues.''
</P>
<P>
   One of a dozen or so police officers assigned to the city's
downtown bike patrols, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
described the fine line between safe streets and civil rights that
the patrols face daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're told to take care of any problems,'' the officer said as
he prepared to begin his evening shift. ``It's a free country, but
it's also a tourist city. We get pressured by the city to do
certain things, to keep the city clean. Maybe some cops go too
far.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In court testimony and pretrial depositions, several patrol
members have insisted that a few years ago their orders went too
far.
</P>
<P>
   They say they were told to harass teen-agers and homeless
people, with or without probable cause suggesting laws were being
broken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Embarrassing'' is how one officer described the policy.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers would wait at the curb for the light to change
because they knew one false step would get them jaywalking tickets.
Another patrolman said officers were advised to follow a simple
formula: If a gang member and a tourist simultaneously jaywalked,
the gang member should be ticketed.
</P>
<P>
   Although most officers have testified that pressure to harass
evaporated after a 1996 internal shake-up brought new leadership to
the downtown patrol, Edward Pina, the president of the American
Civil Liberties Union in San Antonio, said he still frequently
reviews complaints about police treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The complaints have never stopped,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Police Chief Albert Ortiz said the department's mission
to serve and protect gives officers fairly wide latitude beyond
enforcing ordinances and laws.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, officers can tell a drifter to ``take a hike'' if
they suspect he is using a bus stop bench as shelter in stead of
waiting for a ride. But, Ortiz said, unless someone has lodged a
specific complaint, officers can't enforce the order.
</P>
<P>
   ``The operation of any police department is not predicated on
(law) enforcement. That's a minor part of the job,'' he said.
``Most of it is order maintenance and intervening before we feel
there's any violence.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one merchant has a tolerant view about vagrants and
teens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city should never put tourism above its own people,'' said
Bill Barowski, owner of a Back Stage T-shirt store. ``Travelers
have been coming to San Antonio for 200 years, and there were
degenerates then, too.''

   The son of the man who ruled the Soviet Union and its Communist
Party at the peak of its Cold War with the United States is to
become an American citizen next month.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily the naturalization of a Russian emigre, even a rocket
scientist, would be less than remarkable. But Sergei Khrushchev's
father, Nikita, once stood behind the full fury of one of the
world's two great nuclear arsenals and declared ``We will bury
you'' to an American public already drilling its children for a
nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
   And although some have since interpreted the comment as
referring to the competing economic systems of the two countries,
generations of Americans recall little but the image of the
shoe-pounding premier.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five years later, acknowledging his father was wrong
about which economic system would prevail, 63-year-old Sergei
Khruschev will clearly punctuate the end of competition between the
superpowers.
</P>
<P>
   Khrushchev and his wife, Valentina Golenko, are scheduled to
become citizens June 23 at the Immigration and Naturalization
Service regional headquarters in St. Albans, Vt., according to his
Seattle-based immigration lawyer, Dan Danilov.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about this decision and I had the freedom to make
this decision,'' Khrushchev said in a telephone interview yesterday
from his home in Providence, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I have been living here for seven years and working
for Brown University and I am planning to live here longer. If I am
living in the country, I think I have the obligation to be a
citizen, not a foreigner who came for temporary residence.''
</P>
<P>
   Khrushchev, a senior research scholar and lecturer at Brown
University's Center for Foreign Policy Development, is a rocket
engineer and computer scientist who once headed the Soviet Missile
Design Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   He received his ``green card,'' granting him permanent resident
status, in 1993, with the support of former President Nixon,
President Bush and Robert McNamara, defense secretary in the
Kennedy and Johnson administrations, as well as top officials in
the Central Intelligence Agency.
</P>
<P>
   He has published several books about his father, who ruled the
Soviet Union from 1953 until he was deposed in 1964, and about the
Cold War that kept the world under threat of nuclear conflict.
Nikita Khrushchev died in virtual isolation on Sept. 11, 1971.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am lecturing here at Brown University on the history of the
Cold War, and I will teach Soviet history and post-Soviet history
next fall at the Naval War College in Newport, R.I.,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He has lectured at universities and World Affairs Council
functions in Seattle, sometimes with David Eisenhower and his wife,
Julie Nixon Eisenhower, both children of presidents who engaged in
conflicts with Khrushchev's father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is important for everyone to understand that many
of the mistakes made during the Cold War that led to dangerous
conflicts were based on misconceptions and misunderstandings of the
way of thinking
</P>
<P>
   of the other side,'' Khrushchev said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even today, the White House did not think Yugoslavia would
resist after NATO began bombing. When you see the whole picture of
how and why leaders make the decisions that they do, you create a
greater chance for resolving conflict and achieving peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Khrushchev has just published in Russia the four-volume memoirs
of his father containing many documents never before published, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He and Pennsylvania State University Press hope to have an
English-language version published here. Khrushchev's own book on
the history of the Cold War and post-Soviet Russia is to be
published next month.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Khrushchev's varied career included being chief of the
Soviet Missile Design Bureau from 1958 to 1968 and later service as
a professor of missile guidance systems at Moscow Technical
University.
</P>
<P>
   But his life in the United States has also meant explaining his
father's famous ``We will bury you'' remark.
</P>
<P>
   ``This comment was among the things that were misunderstood and
it shows how dangerous this type of misunderstanding can be,''
Sergei Khrushchev said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, he was referring to a socialist centralized
economic system, which he believed would prevail and be more
effective than a free market system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the unfortunate phrasing, it was understood
incorrectly to mean a threat to the safety of the people of the
United States. He never wanted to bury anybody, but he believed in
a Soviet centralized economy. In the end, a free-market system
prevailed.''
</P>
<P>
   Khrushchev said that both he and his wife have been studying for
their citizenship exams, the final step before their
naturalization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a long time ago about America, but now I have to
remember the names and some dates _ and it is good for a teacher to
know what it is like to be a student now and then,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Khrushchev's immigration lawyer, Danilov, said Khrushchev's main
hesitancy in applying for U.S. citizenship was a concern over what
his father would think.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him that Papa will never know about it,'' said Danilov,
himself a naturalized American citizen.

suggest that the Earth is all explored. But at the dawn of a new

ACLU, ACTIVISTS CHALLENGE DOOR-TO-DOOR CANVASSING BAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGMEADOW, Mass. _ As dusk gathers in this well-to-do town of
elegant homes and velvet lawns, a stranger's finger on the doorbell
can signal something worse than boorish company. The visitor may be
breaking the law.
</P>
<P>
   In a decision that has landed it in federal court, officials
here have decided _ with recent voter encouragement _ to ban
door-to-door canvassing after 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The case has advocates on both sides vigorously staking claims
to conflicting fundamental freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit pits Colonial-era rights of free speech, symbolized
by Revolutionary War pamphleteers, against the privacy rights of
weary suburbanites who, after fighting traffic, collecting kids,
and fixing meals, just want to be left alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to paint a picture that Longmeadow is being high
and mighty and we don't want (canvassers) in our town,'' said Hal
Haberman, a selectman in this town of 15,500 some 90 miles west of
Boston. ``We think we're being reasonable. Eight o'clock is late
enough. I have no idea why they're making such a big deal out of
this.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal suit, filed in US District Court in Springfield in
March, is being pursued by an environmental rights group, which
claims the town's bylaw, enacted last fall and reaffirmed by Town
Meeting voters earlier this month, is baldly unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``We canvass between 4 and 9 because that's when people are
home,'' said Christopher C. Bathurst, director of the Northampton
office of Clean Water Action, a nonprofit advocacy group. ``And
between 8 and 9 is our real key time. If we're stripped away that
one hour, that's a huge percentage hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Clean Water Action's case is being championed by the
Massachusetts Civil Liberties Union, which 11 years ago won a
permanent injunction against a Longmeadow bylaw that barred
political lawn signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been down this road before with Longmeadow,'' said
attorney William C. Newman, the ACLU lawyer who is representing
Clean Water Action pro bono. Newman said there is ample court
precedent for a 9 p.m. canvass cutoff, the hour used as quitting
time by US Census Bureau canvassers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is at issue here is not just one hour. It's the crucial
hour,'' said Newman. ``This dismissiveness of First Amendment
rights is really troubling.''
</P>
<P>
   Newman and his clients said they hope the town will reconsider
the bylaw before the case moves ahead before a federal judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people don't want to talk to us, all they have to say is
that they're not interested and we're gone off their step,''
Bathurst said. ``We're not there to sell them anything. They just
need to tell us to go away and we'll go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Clean Water Action, which says it has 700,000 members nationwide
and 30,000 in Massachusetts, has between five and 20 canvassers
that work their way through the state's cities and towns. They are
paid a starting salary of $300 a week, urging voters to write
elected officials on specific issues, handing out fact sheets, and
asking for at least $2 _ the minimum membership fee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really feel bad that there has been this strain put between
our organization and the good folks of Longmeadow. And we're not
happy about that,'' said Bathurst, whose group has canvassed here
since 1986. ``On the other hand, if every town decided they were
going to have an 8 o'clock ordinance, it would shut down that
portion of our outreach operation.''
</P>
<P>
   The town's decision to enact its ``Go Away'' policy stems from
complaints to local police from residents, who said they were tired
of being pestered by evening visitors, pushing policies, peddling
candies, or asking for money.
</P>
<P>
   Longmeadow modeled its bylaw on a similar one that has been in
effect, without complaint, in Walpole. Both bylaws have been
reviewed by the state attorney general's office, which found no
blatant constitutional problems but did not formally endorse them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were surprised that one hour was such a big issue,'' said
Julia Whitlock, the town administrator. ``People felt they were
being annoyed at hours they didn't particularly appreciate.
Obviously you can't stop it, and we recognize that you have to be
reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitlock said that for a good part of the year, darkness has
overtaken dusk by 8 p.m. _ no time for unwanted callers on the
doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Pelmas, a retired businessman and a longtime resident,
agrees, noting that the advocacy group is winning no friends in
Longmeadow by fighting the wishes of townspeople.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 8 o'clock people are putting kids to bed. It's a quiet
time,'' Pelmas said. ``I just don't understand the arrogance of
Clean Water Action. The people of this town have clearly expressed
their opinion that they don't want to be solicited. And the ACLU?
Don't they have something better to do than sue a small town?''
</P>
<P>
   But one person's down time is another person's prime time. And
for Clean Water Action, concerned about emissions from nearby power
plants and Hamden County asthma rates, the time to strike is when
people are at home.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers filed with its lawsuit, the group cites a 1973
US Commerce Department study that shows significantly more people
are at home between 8 and 9 p.m. than in the hours before that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hamden County has some of the worst air quality in the
state,'' Bathurst said. ``That's really bad news for the elderly
and kids with asthma. This is a big deal out here. So what we care
about is why we're out here. We're not out there because we want to
force a free-speech issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Longmeadow town counsel David J. Martel said a citizens advocacy
group successfully challenged a series of local bylaws in state
court in 1985 that sought to cut off door-to-door solicitation at
sunset, or restrict it to daylight hours. The court ruled then,
Martel said, that it was legal up until 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this will be a clear test between 8 o'clock and 9
o'clock,'' said Martel.
</P>
<P>
   Federal rulings in Connecticut and Wisconsin, which upheld the
right to solicit until 9 p.m., are not legally binding in the
Longmeadow case.
</P>
<P>
   But they could presage a legal setback that could mean
Longmeadow taxpayers, among the state's most affluent, would have
to pay the plaintiff's legal fees and perhaps tens of thousands of
dollars in damages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do you draw the line in these two competing interests?
That is what this is all about,'' Martel said. ``People would
prefer not to have people knocking on their doors, but at the same
time the First Amendment recognizes the right of people to go
door-to-door. The people of Longmeadow felt they wanted to draw the
line at 8 o'clock.''
</P>
<P>
   Haberman said the bylaw has nothing to do with the exclusivity
that non-residents sometimes attach to this wealthy bedroom
community _ median income $63,200 _ settled in the 1640s by
Springfield residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``People for the most part don't want people showing up at their
houses at that hour _ and that's anywhere,'' the selectman said.
Clean Water Action ``should have said, `OK. Eight o'clock is what
this community wants.' Instead it's a little like the little kid
who says, `If you don't let me play, I'm going to take my ball and
go home.' ''

FOR THE LOVE OF IT 
Amateuring and Its Rivals 
By Wayne Booth 
University of Chicago Press, 237 pp., illustrated, $22 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wayne Booth knows about being an expert. A professor emeritus of
English at the University of Chicago and the author of several
books on style, Booth has spent much of his 70-something years as
the ultimate judge, the one giving the final word. What he is still
learning, as his endearing new book makes clear, is how to be an
amateur.
</P>
<P>
   Being an amateur is not the same as being a beginner, and it is
more than what Booth refers to as the ``without'' definition, that
is, more than just ``lacking professional skill or ease.'' As
Booth's playful prose in ``For the Love of It'' sets out to
explain, being an amateur can and should be a lifelong pursuit,
followed with honor and affection. His career (if one may call it
that) as an amateur cellist began more than 40 years ago when, at
age 31, he, an academic, decided to learn. That's when his lifelong
love of music combined with his attachment to (and mild jealousy
of) his violinist wife and the rare opportunity of leisure time to
allow him to begin lessons. Four decades later, he and his wife
play regularly in amateur chamber-music groups, continue to take
music lessons, and ponder the meaning of such a pursuit in an
increasingly professional world.
</P>
<P>
   This book _ really a collection of essays, along with bits of
dialogue taken from rehearsals and lessons _ is, like its subject,
a work of love and whimsy. As anyone who has decided to follow an
alternate pursuit, whether it be music or sandlot league sports,
knows, ``amateuring,'' as Booth terms it, comes in for a lot of
criticism. Professionals deride the quality of amateur work; the
more single-minded scoff at what may seem a dilettantish approach.
Booth tackles both of these critics _ focusing on the second _ in
his attempt to return to the word the dignity of its etymological
root: the Latin amo, or ``I love.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do quite literally love to play the cello _ especially when
others are playing with me,'' he writes. Alternating between the
philosophical (``what makes a good teacher?'') and the
autobiographical, as well as between styles, this book serves as a
running commentary on the nature and depth of this love, and all
the connections it has formed in his life. As quickly becomes
clear, Booth loves his wife, he loves his music, and he loves his
instrument (though he is more than willing to admit to his ``cello
booboos'' and general inadequacies), and these passions inform his
arguments with a warmth that even his excellent and clear-minded
``The Rhetoric of Fiction'' lacked.
</P>
<P>
   This happy emotion, however, is not without conflicts, and Booth
does admit to the problems caused by his multiple focuses, mixing
such deeper issues in with the light-hearted observations. What
value, he asks repeatedly and in different ways, do we put on our
pursuits and on our time? ``To celebrate playing for the love of it
risks downplaying the work we do that we love.'' Why do we chose to
divert our limited financial, temporal, and mental resources to
learn an instrument? ``In retirement my desk seems _ and I'm sure
its an illusion _ much more deeply flooded with unperformed tasks
then it did when I was teaching full time,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why bother at any stage of life to work for some new skill or
know-how instead of dwelling comfortably with skills already
mastered? . . . Isn't anything worth doing worth doing really well
_ better than you'll ever paint or photograph or golf or play chess
or surf or row a boat or perform the role of King Lear in an
amateur production? And meanwhile, what about all those rival ways
of spending . . . time?''
</P>
<P>
   An honest man, he lays out the real price of his amateur
playing. For a dedicated music lover, he explains, time spent
practicing takes away from time spent listening. ``A radical
sacrifice is made, day after day, year after year. I no longer
spend anything like an hour a day listening to professionals and I
miss it. Is the playing worth the sacrifice?''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, he concludes, it is. This is true in no small part
because of the social interaction his playing of chamber music
facilitates. But beyond all, he admits, it is the music that draws
him. ``This morning,'' he writes. ``reading about the usual
atrocities in the morning paper, I hear intruding the lovely
pattern of ritardando arpeggios at the end of that slow movement. .
. . Sometimes, when we have worked especially hard and then
experienced an especially good session, the hangover will run on
for weeks.'' The music, he concludes, has become part of him, and
that is worth the price.

OUTSPOKEN AUTHOR FINDS RESISTANCE IN A VERMONT TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDITH GAINES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH BENNINGTON, Vt. _ Jamaica Kincaid, the author who writes
and sometimes speaks with a rapier, insists this story is not about
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about a small town and people acting in a high-handed
way,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And she claims it's about a problem all too common in Vermont
and other New England states: How siall, self-perpetuating cliques
run their communities by whim and happenstance, ignoring views that
don't jibe with their own.
</P>
<P>
   What touched off the current controversy was the village's
decision to deny the celebrated author a seat on its planning
commission, despite her having been the only one interested in the
job for months.
</P>
<P>
   Local leaders in this southern Vermont village, population
1,400, don't think broader issues are at stake. They question
Kincaid's motives and say they're uncomfortable with her outsider
status and prickly personality. After all, how could they work with
a woman who called the chairman of the board ``incompetent''?
</P>
<P>
   ``You can understand how they might think, if she thinks we're a
bunch of fools, how's it going to be to have her working with us?''
said John Ulrich, a second-grade teacher who heads North
Bennington's Board of Trustees.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the commission unanimously recommended and the
trustees approved the appointment of a 28-year-old native, Jonah
Thiem, instead of Kincaid, 50, who was born in Antigua.
</P>
<P>
   Kincaid's wrenching memoir, ``My Brother,'' was recently
nominated for the National Book Award. The New York Times has
described her as ``a ferociously honest woman (who operates) on her
own uncompromising terms.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Kevan Jones, who headed the five-member planning
commission when Kincaid's application was turned down, the
commissioners favored Thiem because he was employed in the county
as a social worker, belongs to a younger generation that needs to
be more involved in public affairs, and was born and raised in
North Bennington.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the most familiar with our area,'' said Jones, 76, a
retired architect. ``He has firsthand knowledge of what people in
this community need.''
</P>
<P>
   Kincaid countered, ``I understand them perfectly well. They
don't understand me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ulrich added that Kincaid's application wasn't helped by some of
her caustic public comments, including calling Jones incompetent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was being generous in calling him incompetent,'' Kincaid
retorted.
</P>
<P>
   She said she's just exercising her democratic right to criticize
the laxness and wrongdoing she sees in the village government.
</P>
<P>
   She pointed to several questionable actions by the commission
and the board, including that her application was denied without a
hearing, and that Jones sought another applicant for the opening
after she applied, when his term of office had expired.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that obvious things about me also play
into this: I'm a woman, I'm black,'' Kincaid said.
</P>
<P>
   North Bennington has barely a half-dozen black families, and
Vermont has the fewest blacks of any state in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But several trustees and commissioners insisted that neither
race nor gender figured in their decision. Some pointed to another
issue: Kincaid applied for the job after a private school for
troubled teens proposed to convert a house adjacent to her property
into a dormitory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prior to that, she hadn't shown any interest'' in the
commission, said Ron Pembroke, a landscape contractor on the Board
of Trustees. ``It appeared that she wanted to block that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kincaid said she opposed the dormitory conversion but not for
reasons of narrow self-interest. In any case, she observed, ``What
is democracy but a practical daily exercise? It isn't just
theoretical . . . We the people, you bet!''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gray, a jeweler who has just resigned from the planning
commission, said Kincaid's charges ``have totally caught me by
surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   North Bennington ``is a pretty WASP-y area, without a lot of
cultural diversity,'' he said. But in his nearly four years on the
commission, he said he never saw any actions that smacked of racism
or sexism.
</P>
<P>
   Those who abuse power often fail to recognize their
shortcomings, Kincaid countered. ``It's not out of the blue at all.
It's here every day. The commission has an absence of critical
consciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   If North Bennington is run by a clique, then it's a laid-back,
artsy, well-intentioned bunch, several locals say.
</P>
<P>
   It's the sort of place that has no traffic lights, or street
numbers on houses. Folks work at Bennington College, or the local
schools, or the hospital, or one of a few small industries. Quite a
few are artists or writers. Authors Bernard Malamud and Shirley
Jackson have both lived here.
</P>
<P>
   The local hangout is Powers' Market, a friendly gourmet grocery
store selling items such as sesame noodles, pates, baked homemade
potato chips, and specialty olive oils.
</P>
<P>
   With only four paid employees, the village relies on voluntary
labor for most public tasks.
</P>
<P>
   The type of question that usually comes before the planning
commission ``is whether someone should have to take down their
Christmas lights or whether a porch extension will fit on
somebody's property,'' Ulrich said. ``It's pretty dry stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last five years, there has never been more than one
candidate for any spot on the commission. So no one has really
scrutinized its selection process.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Ulrich added, the commissioners are just
volunteers, doing the best they can. ``There's not enough action to
warrant hiring professionals.''
</P>
<P>
   This is part of what Kincaid means when she complains about
laxness and cliquish behavior. A resident who is involved in local
affairs but declined to give his name agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lethargy in North Bennington,'' he said. ``It's a
bedroom community that houses people with a higher than normal
amount of socio-economic success. They're well-intentioned people
who don't have the time or technical expertise to cope with federal
rules and fulfill their responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph J. Joseph, 76, a retired school superintendent, called it
``the North Bennington Syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The symptoms are: If you criticize the status quo because you
don't think the way they think or believe that due process is being
followed, you're ostracized,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In general, people who express unpopular or unfamiliar ideas are
greeted with ``a gentle type of sarcasm. It's a question of
attitude,'' Joseph said. ``In Jamaica's case, though, the behavior
was more extreme.''
</P>
<P>
   But this is a story that may end more happily than most of
Kincaid's searing, powerful books.
</P>
<P>
   When Jones and Gray stepped down from the planning commission
(both for personal reasons unconnected to the controversy, they
said), Kincaid decided to reapply.
</P>
<P>
   ``More likely than not, she'll be appointed,'' Ulrich said.
</P>
<P>
   And Kincaid has also agreed to join a group working to revise
the village master plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad she didn't go off in a huff and say that we're just a
bunch of hicks and good ol' boys,'' Ulrich said. ``We see that she
has a lot to offer.''

INCREASINGLY, A WOMAN'S PLACE IS IN THE BOARDROOM

 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   STRATHAM, N.H. _ Jeffrey Swartz, dressed in a blue workshirt,
khakis, and, of course, Timberland shoes, looks pretty laid back.
But the chief executive was nothing if not intense in persuading
Indra Nooyi to join Timberland Co.'s board.
</P>
<P>
   Swartz telephoned Nooyi, a PepsiCo Inc. senior vice president,
repeatedly over six months last year. When he wasn't calling
himself, he was asking business associates to help woo her. Swartz
charmed Nooyi's assistant with chat about the assistant's lifelong
passion, the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   In a final, desperate act, he mailed a pair of yellow Timberland
boots to PepsiCo chief executive, Roger Enrico, with a letter
pleading for his support. His efforts paid off: Nooyi became
Timberland's first woman board member in February.
</P>
<P>
   More and more women executives with stellar credentials, like
Nooyi, are being invited into Corporate America's boardrooms, their
presence rising slowly and steadily to 11 percent of all Fortune
500 board seats.
</P>
<P>
   But a look behind the numbers, to the stories of how individual
women are recruited, often reveals a male chief executive, like
Swartz, who was willing to reach outside his traditional networks
or walk unconventional paths to snare them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I basically begged,'' Swartz said during an interview last
week after Timberland's 12th annual meeting, set in the tall pines
of rural New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting, Virginia Kent, president of Hasbro's US toy
group, also was appointed to Timberland's board.
</P>
<P>
   Companies seek out women to join their boards because it makes
sense. A woman's perspective gives insight into the psyche of half
of the customers or brings a fresh eye to management issues. Throw
two women into the mix, women executives say, and the dynamic of a
board is dramatically altered.
</P>
<P>
   The first requirement for any new board member is the right
qualifications.
</P>
<P>
   Finding the right women is where the difficulty may come in. In
selecting any board member, companies compile a list of dozens of
potential candidates. While there may be many women who would fit
the profile, an all-male board may be at a loss to tap into the
extensive network of women necessary to narrow the list of suitable
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Often they turn to women they know.
</P>
<P>
   FSI International, a semiconductor maker, worked through a
female investment banker to contact Joanna Lau, president and
founder of Lau Technologies, a small defense and security equipment
company in Littleton.
</P>
<P>
   At the request of the investment banker, Lau sent her vitals to
Joel Elftmann, FSI's chief executive. Elftmann picked up the
telephone and personally asked Lau to fly to Minneapolis to sit in
on a board meeting. After a dinner with members and their wives,
Elftmann escorted Lau to the elevator and asked if she could commit
12 days a year to meetings at headquarters in Chaska, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Look, I have no semiconductor experience. That's not
my field,' '' said Lau. ``And he said, `I have plenty of PhDs, and
that's the last thing I need.' '' Rather, Elftmann wanted Lau for
her experience operating companies and as an entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   Lau said she believes she is on FSI's board because of
Elftmann's determination: ``He made a commitment to do it and he
did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Nager in February became the first woman on the board of
Candela Corp., which makes lasers for use in cosmetic surgeries,
tatoo removal, and hair removal.
</P>
<P>
   Candela's motivation for seeking out Nager was twofold: her
experience as chief executive of Specialized Health Management, a
health care services company, and a recognition by the board that a
woman would ``give them a different perspective on their
products,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As more women populate corporate boards or the upper ranks of
management, especially in the nation's biggest corporations, the
network for recruiting them has grown: 86 percent of Fortune 500
companies have one or more women on their boards _ up from 69
percent in 1993, according to Catalyst, a New York research firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It no longer will suffice to say you can't find a woman who
can add value,'' said Sheila Wellington, Catalyst's president.
``It's simply not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Although a growing number of chief executives are committed to
putting women on their boards, a few will admit to being pushed.
</P>
<P>
   Swartz, Timberland's energetic chief executive who is not yet
40, said he once became ``incensed'' by a letter from a shareholder
asking tough questions about why there were no women on the board
of the apparel and shoe company.
</P>
<P>
   But he relented only after a contentious and eye-opening
discussion with a woman who had worked for him for years. ``She
said, `You don't understand the signal of what a board of all men
means to me as a woman,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And so, the search that brought Nooyi and Kent to Timberland's
nine-member board began.
</P>
<P>
   Swartz found them through The Boston Club, which began as a
network for professional women and has become active nationwide in
helping corporations find women.
</P>
<P>
   The demands of a career and family had kept Hasbro's Kent from
accepting earlier offers to be on boards. Thanks in part to The
Boston Club's efforts, Timberland, Kent said, was the right fit,
because it was ``good for my career'' in the retail industry.
</P>
<P>
   Toni Wolfman, partner at Boston law firm Foley Hoag &AMP; Eliot and
a Boston Club member, said, ``If a CEO is not committed you're
going to have trouble. The question then becomes: How do you get
the CEO committed? I think there are roles for other people to
play.''

AILING HMOS FORCED TO PASS ALONG HIGHER COSTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Massachusetts's big health maintenance organizations did some
serious financial bleeding in the first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim Health Care and Fallon Community Health had big
losses; Tufts Health Plan had a modest loss; Blue Cross and Blue
Shield of Massachusetts eked out a small profit. The numbers for
1998 looked no better.
</P>
<P>
   Can the HMOs recover? The answer is probably yes. In fact, an
easy-to-follow model has already been laid out by the nation's big
investor-owned HMOs, most of which have managed to turn losses into
profits over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   There's only one problem: The steps the HMOs take to get better
are likely to leave the rest of us feeling worse.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, HMOs began running into trouble in 1997. The problem
was not difficult to diagnose. A slowdown in medical inflation that
began a few years earlier convinced corporate America that
health-care costs had plateaued permanently. As a result, companies
dug in their heels and bargained for the lowest rates they could
get.
</P>
<P>
   The HMOs were happy to comply. They too seemed to feel they had
a handle on costs. Emboldened, they cut their rates in many parts
of the country in a bid to win market share from rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Life would have been wonderful for everyone if only medical
costs truly had stopped rising. Unfortunately they had not. Driven
by double-digit increases in the cost of prescription drugs, health
costs have moved off the plateau and started climbing a new
mountain.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need a degree in medicine or accounting to figure out
that an insurer who cuts his rates while his costs are rising is
going to lose money.
</P>
<P>
   Pacificare Health Systems, a big California HMO, lost money in
1997. United Healthcare, based in Minnesota, had a whopping loss in
the second quarter of 1998. Connecticut-based Oxford Health Plans
lost so much money in the second quarter of 1998 that the company
looked as if it might not survive.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward to the first quarter of 1999 and the picture is
very different. All three HMOs were profitable in the quarter, and
all three have seen their stock prices rebound smartly in the past
six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   What happened? Two things, actually. In all cases, the HMOs
raised their prices, anywhere from 7 percent to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these HMOs were at the point where they were not
viable,'' says Peter Zuger, a portfolio manager at State Street
Research in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The price hikes were not a one-time event. The California Public
Employees Retirement System last week said the rates it pays HMOs
will climb 9.7 percent next year. As one of the nation's leading
purchasers of health care, Calpers tends to be a trendsetter for
the nation. In other words, the west wind is likely to blow east.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago a 1 percent rate hike was unusual,'' says Susan
Connolly, an executive with William M. Mercer, a benefits
consulting firm. ``Now some companies are talking about
double-digit increases.''
</P>
<P>
   The second action the investor-owned HMOs took to restore
profitability was no more popular. They stopped serving patients in
lines of business that were losing money. United Healthcare dropped
out of the Medicare program in certain markets. Aetna, another big
HMO, withdrew from Medicare in six states, including Massachusetts.
Oxford withdrew from the Medicaid program in New York state.
Medicare is a government insurance plan for senior citizens;
Medicaid is a government plan for low-income people.
</P>
<P>
   The HMOs insisted that government _ both state and federal _ was
paying them too little to take care of people. They may be right.
In the meantime, however, several hundred thousand people around
the country have had to find new insurance providers.
</P>
<P>
   Could the same steps be taken here? It is already happening. All
of the major local HMOs have announced big rates hikes for next
year. Perhaps because this market is dominated by not-for-profit
HMOs, the companies here were slower to raise rates than their
investor-owned counterparts. That distinction won't last. Harvard
Pilgrim has announced rate increases of 8 to 10 percent for 2000;
Tufts has told customers to expect increases of 6 to 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Last year both Tufts and Blue Cross said they would no longer
participate in the state's Medicaid program. None of the major
players has quit the Medicare business, but such a move cannot be
ruled out, say those in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Many will blame the HMOs for these hard-nosed tactics. After
all, weren't they supposed to hold down the cost of health care,
rather than passing it on to the rest of us?
</P>
<P>
   In theory, yes. But in practice, the rest of us have made it
clear we are not interested in living in a world in which HMOs
aggressively try to cut costs. We don't want our choice of doctors
or drugs restricted; nor do we want to see our doctors and
hospitals squeezed too hard. We want the best, even if we don't
always want to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   As Pogo might have put it: ``We have met the enemy and he is
us.''

APACHE PILOTS PRACTICE IN CASE OF REAL THING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RINAS, Albania _ Lieutenant Matthew B. Holloway, an Apache
helicopter pilot with the earnest manners and easygoing grin of a
war movie ace, doesn't know what it feels like to fire rockets at
real people.
</P>
<P>
   And with Washington and NATO still debating when, and even
whether, to employ the lethal, low-flying Apaches against the
Yugoslav Army in Kosovo, he's wondering if he'll go home without
finding out.
</P>
<P>
   But Holloway, 25, did know one thing Monday: He wasn't planning
to be up in time for breakfast this morning. He was scheduled to
fly another training mission Tuesday night _ just in case his
ground-hugging, heavily armed aircraft ever does get sent into
combat. With post-flight analysis and the possibility of another
good video (the Vietnam classic ``Deer Hunter'' was Sunday's
choice), he knew he might not get to bed until 3 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're busy, but we're not exactly in a hurry,'' Holloway said,
only half-joking. ``We wait for the mail. We wander around. We do
whatever needs to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Holloway and the other Army pilots' lives have been like that
for nearly a month. Sent to Albania in the glare of publicity, they
have been left to wait in the heat for a decision, along with
everyone else. Just Monday, NATO's supreme commander, General
Wesley K. Clark was on the sprawling Rinas base saying that more
live-fire exercises are necessary.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the 24 Apaches mostly sit idle on a runway at the
airport just outside the Albanian capital of Tirana, on farmland
and property that has been leased or purchased by the military.
Intended to strike close up at Serbian targets in Yugoslavia,
unlike the high-flying Navy or Air Force planes, the Apache was
initially heralded as the war machine to halt Serb-led Yugoslavia's
war on the ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pentagon and President Clinton appear reluctant to test
the Apache's prowess in combat and put American lives at risk. Two
Apaches have crashed in nighttime exercises in Albania, the last
time killing two pilots. Holloway, who flew over Bosnia but has
never directly engaged the enemy in combat, says he is in no hurry
to find out how he and his aircraft would do in Serbian airspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one in the military is going to tell you they want to go
into a situation where they may get killed,'' he said. ``But that's
my job and I don't have any qualms about doing it. I don't want to
shoot anyone. But I do want to make sure this is over as soon as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   As Holloway explained between running a pre-flight check _
kicking the tires, he called it _ and practicing a hop over to
Belgrade on a flight simulator that resembles an advanced video
game, each Apache is assigned two pilots. One sits in back and
flies the chopper. The front-seater fires the rockets. Holloway is
the one who sits up front and does the shooting, though only over
water during training exercises.

   Holloway, who grew up in Flint, Mich., was 17 when he went to a
West Point. He went on to major in civil engineering and insisted
that building bridges wouldn't bore him if he decided to put his
degree to use after his Army stint ends.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, he owes the military at least 3 1/2 more years
and, despite the boredom at the Rinas base, he said he has no
complaints. Unlike some other pilots and crew members who have
expressed frustration at their stalled status, he even said he was
having fun. He is, however, a bit envious of pilots from other NATO
nations, who can drink liquor on base and go off-base for
recreation _ both taboo for the American military.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always wanted to fly, ever since I went to my first air
show,'' said Holloway, the grandson of a Navy pilot who flew in
World War II as well as a ringer for Tom Cruise in the movie ``Top
Gun.'' ``I'm getting to do what I want to do, and it really doesn't
matter where it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Stationed in Germany when he isn't stuck on the ground outside
Tirana, Holloway described days that might be maddening to someone
unfamiliar with the small routines of military life. Grab a banana
and orange after opting for sleep instead of breakfast; shower,
shave, pick up the day's mission order. Attend a briefing, study
satellite imagery, cadge cookies from a buddy's care package from
home, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   The Apache pilots and ground crew members are using the down
time to make sure the aircraft are in flawless working order and to
improve their knowledge of what and whom they may be up against.
During each training mission, Holloway said, he studies the
terrain, notes previously unseen transmission wires, hovers over
anything unfamiliar to take a closer look. By now, he has seen the
entire Albanian coast and is conversant with local architectural
styles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pilots are constantly updating maps,'' said Captain Martin
Downie, an Army spokesman and a Springfield, Mass., native. ``Each
time they go up, they're maximizing their knowledge and making it
safer and safer for the day they have to fly'' into enemy
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway's regular helicopter is back in Germany, since the Army
brought only half the Apaches stationed there. Fortunately, most of
his friends from that relatively small base of 600 or so came, too.
Now, he said, they keep one another company.
</P>
<P>
   They also try to remember how much money they are saving, since
they are living tax-free while all of their expenses are covered.
Still, he'd rather return to Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we got back in time for Oktoberfest in October, and
I've got my fingers crossed now,'' Holloway said. ``Just imagine
it. Guys who have been stuck in Albania for four months. Guys who
have had to go that long without beer.''

AS HIS TERM ENDS, MANDELA GETS MIXED REVIEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ On the day Nelson Mandela was sworn in as South
Africa's first democratically elected president, the country was in
tatters. More than 10,000 people had died in political violence
while Mandela's African National Congress and the former government
negotiated the end of apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   The economy held a flat growth rate for five years. The law
books were heavy with the statutes of the old order. The needs of
the masses were overwhelming: 12 million people had no reasonable
access to potable water; 64 percent of households did not have
electricity; the vast majority of blacks did not have adequate
health care. And the military, civil service, police and judiciary
all rested in the hands of white men.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later much has changed in South Africa, and much
remains to be changed. As Mandela prepares to step off the
political stage and into retirement after the June 2 elections, his
leadership draws as much harsh criticism as it does warm praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we talk about Mandela the president, we can only talk on
the symbolic, moral level,'' said Themba Sono, a University of
Pretoria professor. ``He was instrumental in averting a racial war,
but as an effective, hands-on president, he was an absolute
disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   While managing to soothe fearful whites as he led the nation's
first black majority government, Mandela largely failed to uplift
blacks. He often placed party and personal loyalties above the
national interest, and he leaves a nation no longer at war, but not
yet at peace with itself.
</P>
<P>
   But from where Mandela started there clearly is progress. Ahmed
Cathrada, Mandela's longtime comrade and fellow prisoner for 27
years, recalls what he found the day he walked into his new office
as the president's parliamentary counselor. ``Nothing. There wasn't
a scrap of paper. We had to start from scratch,'' he said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   The political deal ending apartheid required Mandela to form a
government jointly with the dominant opposition parties. Former
foes would share the job of creating the new dispensation. One
hundred days into his administration, in his first budget address
to parliament, Mandela defined the course: ``From the outset, the
government of national unity set itself two interrelated tasks:
reconciliation and reconstruction, nation-building and
development.''
</P>
<P>
   By either index _ reconciliation or reconstruction _ the
achievements of Mandela's government are limited.
</P>
<P>
   Race relations are no better today than in 1994. According to a
public survey conducted last month for the Independent Newspaper
Group, 44 percent of respondents agreed that ``blacks and whites
will never trust each other,'' while on 24 percent disagreed. Only
8 percent of whites said they would not be bothered if their
children married across the race line. The study found that ``when
black and white South Africans talk about unity and reconciliation
it seems they are talking about different things.'' In general
terms, blacks see reconciliation as an equal division of the
country's resources; whites simply want to stop talking about the
past.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela can rightly claim that his government brought clean
drinking water within 200 yards of the dwellings of 3 million
people. His government promised to build 1 million houses in five
years, but as of last December _ the latest that statistics are
available _ 681,000 were either finished or under construction.
Some 2.3 million more households have electricity. Compared with
any previous five-year period, those represent unprecedented
advances.
</P>
<P>
   But unemployment hovers near 40 percent. The economy is growing
at less than 2 percent. Thousands of schools are overcrowded, lack
textbooks and have no electricity; barely 53 percent of high school
seniors pass their final exams and qualify for graduation. Health
care is now free for children under age 6, but township clinics are
ill-equipped and the standard of care available to the majority
continues to decline.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa has the highest rate of rape in the world, and
other forms of violent crime continue to rise, including brazen
attacks on police stations. At the same time, police statistics
indicate that conviction rates have fallen steadily each of the
past five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take the gamut from land reform to education, the policies of
Mandela's government were weak,'' said Mahmood Mamdani, a professor
of African Studies at the University of Cape Town. ``They've come
with good intentions but without a proper grasp on the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that they haven't tried. The new Gender Commission and the
Human Rights Commission are meant to be independent protectors of
civil rights, while the Employment Equity Act and the Basic
Conditions of Employment Act were designed to give the
long-oppressed more access to professional work and greater rights
on the shop floor.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these measures, however, ``there is a widening gap
between policy and delivery and with that comes rising social
tension,'' said Graeme Simpson, director of the Center for the
Study of Violence and Reconciliation in Johannesburg. ``The most
marginalized _ women, children, and black youth _ are even more
marginalized. We shouldn't be surprised that there is sustained
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandela began his presidency inheriting a reluctant civil
service. Mandela's ANC, still more of a liberation movement that a
political party, lacked both the research capacity and experience
for effective policymaking. Experts hailed a national crime
prevention strategy as it looked on paper, but it has had little
impact.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela's instincts did not always serve him or the nation well.
He peopled his Cabinet with comrades from the anti-apartheid
struggle, and refused to reprimand or remove them either for
incompetence or mismanagement. ``It is part of our morality,'' he
said last fall at the White House, ``that we do not abandon our
friends.'' As a result, his foreign policy was neither consistent
nor, at times, coherent.
</P>
<P>
   His loyalty to party also led to problems. The ANC, still more
of a liberation movement that a political party, lacked both the
research capacity and experience for effective policymaking.
</P>
<P>
   During the first three years of his adminstration, Mandela made
highly symbolic gestures toward the white minority to avoid
alienating it as the majority took the reins of power. In December
1997, his tone shifted dramatically. From that point on, his
speeches, penned by Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, carried an
increasingly strident theme: Whites have an obligation to pay back
the social debt of their privilege.
</P>
<P>
   The speeches are just one way that Mandela, obsessed with
creating a smooth transition after his departure, allowed his
tenure to be shaped by those below him. Midway through his
presidency, he began relinquishing day-to-day control to Mbeki, who
is expected to win the June 2 elections.
</P>
<P>
   That ceding of power led to tensions from within, as Mbeki's
policies strayed from Mandela's priorities. As he leaves office,
Mandela is unlikely to be held to account for his contradictions
and shortfalls.
</P>
<P>
   He met South Africa's need at a delicate time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really were looking for a monarch in 1994,'' Sono said.
``There could have been a racial holocaust in this country. It is
that that most of us would like to remember.''

MENINO, CUOMO SET EXAMPLE ON RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Case closed.
</P>
<P>
   And the right way, too.
</P>
<P>
   What erupted as a demeaning spitting match nearly four months
ago between two of the better pols in America _ Housing and Urban
Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino _
has been settled in a way that gives politics (as in the grease
that makes government work) a good name.
</P>
<P>
   And in the case of the politics of race, which was at the core
of the conflict, what gives this settlement a good aroma is that it
does not appear to have involved any compromise of consequence.
Instead, the deal affirmed the legitimate positions of the locals
and the feds without affecting a policy of zero tolerance for hate
and racism (in this case, in public housing projects).
</P>
<P>
   The wise guys around here have picked over the settlement's
entrails to discern winner and loser. But in the process they
missed the beneficiary of the late-blooming good will: Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   It could not have been more obvious, but there was Mayor Menino,
the big cheese at a Boston fund-raising dinner for Gore, glowing as
best as this direct man can, introducing the vice president in the
most personal of terms, reflecting what has become (via empowerment
zones, public education reform, and other specific interactions) a
friendship.
</P>
<P>
   But however personal the mayor's early support of Gore for the
Democratic presidential nomination, don't think it would have been
possible had this avoidable mess between the mayor and the
secretary not been cleaned up quickly. As it was, there was more
than one mayoral intimate who thought Menino should do more
political bargaining before making an endorsement decision.
</P>
<P>
   Not the least among those urging the course Menino took,
however, was another big-time mayor who took the step way back last
year. Chicago's Rich Daley is Menino's soul brother on the subject
of taking charge and responsibility for the public schools in order
to be a force for higher standards and reform; they are close. And
if there is ever a Gore administration, no two mayors in the United
States will have more clout than Daley and Menino.
</P>
<P>
   For all this to happen, two pols had to come together without so
much as a wink at the hate and racism that must always be opposed
wherever they rear their heads. And this is big-time hate and
racism, what HUD investigators properly termed systematic
discrimination against nonwhite tenants in South Boston and
Charlestown that reached the moral equivalent of torture earlier in
the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo needed to deal with oversights; Menino couldn't avert his
eyes from the essential truth of the findings, not that he would.
</P>
<P>
   For HUD, the basic problem in February was context and
perspective. The initial report properly focused on horrid
incidents involving nine families, in effect providing the federal
government's factual blessing on a situation that spells civil
rights lawsuit, especially in the face of chronic and documented
official neglect and unresponsiveness. In fact, the class-action
litigation has been kicking around for three years, all but crying
out for settlement by a responsive city.
</P>
<P>
   But the report was much more limited in time than its
explosiveness acknowledged, in effect allowing an impression that
nothing had changed since the 1992-96 period that was its focus.
The report also hit what remains Boston's exposed nerve of race;
there's a lot of history here (most of it bad), but also a lot of
recent history (a lot of it good), and for all the local intensity,
the truth is that Boston isn't close to unique.
</P>
<P>
   The remedy was obvious: a follow-on study of the last three
years, another 150 interviews, and 23 more pages of report that
focused on the events of the last three years under a public
housing administrator, Sandra Henriquez, who is getting national
attention in this tough field. This one was brought to town by
Cuomo himself and unveiled with the mayor himself.
</P>
<P>
   Menino pledged diligence in carrying out HUD's 50-plus
recommendations for further changes. Cuomo stressed that Boston is
a symptom of a national problem, that its work since 1996 has been
more than promising, but that hate crimes and discrimination are
still present. No quarrel from Menino, who got a chance to reaffirm
his policy of zero tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   With different principals, this could have all gotten out of
hand and turned inflammatory. That it became something positive,
and that two days later Menino was in a hotel ballroom endorsing
Gore, is a tribute to what the original Mayor Daley (Rich's dad)
liked to call ``good government.''

PLAN FOR MASSACHUSETTS CHAIN GANG BRINGS CONCERN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JORDANA HART  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chain gangs of inmates, shackled ankle-to-ankle like on old
South highways, are coming to Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in this state, a county sheriff will lock
teams of nonviolent convicts together in leg irons and send them
out to clean streets, paint curbs, and pick vegetables at farms.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol County Sheriff Thomas M. Hodgson said the inmates,
dressed in bright red jumpsuits and followed by two armed guards,
will learn teamwork and valuable life experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not punitive,'' Hodgson said. ``Right now, (inmates)
have not been able to access an opportunity to develop a work
ethic. This also gives them another benefit: Learning teamwork.
Five guys connected by a restraint means they have to learn to
cooperate with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Hodgson's plan to introduce chain gangs next month touched off
outrage among civil liberties advocates, who said a practice that
evokes old images of Southern slavery and shame does not belong in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't believe it at first,'' said John Roberts, director of
the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts. ``It is the
kind of thing that brings up images of an era we like to think is
gone. It is the kind of punishment that puts people in public
humiliation. I hope this doesn't spread'' to other houses of
correction.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Rubenstein, northeast regional director for Amnesty
International, is calling state legislators, asking them to protest
or outlaw chain gangs. Southeastern Massachusetts lawmakers could
not immediately be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts will join nine other states _ most of them in the
South or West _ that use what corrections officials call ``tandem
work crews.'' Alabama was the first to resurrect chain gangs in
1995 following a 30-year nationwide hiatus.
</P>
<P>
   Hodgson says the unpaid chain gangs will give work experience to
inmates who until now were ineligible to leave the jail on
traditional prerelease work crews because they have too much time
left to serve. Participation is voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   The chain gang did not seem a popular notion with other
sheriffs, who said they plan to stick with their prerelease work
crews.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Paul Cellucci had no position on the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Hodgson said no sex offenders or inmates with serious records
would be allowed on the chain gang. He plans to have three crews of
five inmates, and hopes to send them out each day.
</P>
<P>
   Some sheriffs refused to criticize Hodgson, but also said the
topic of chain gangs had not come up in sheriff association
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my case, I see no need for it,'' said Worcester County
Sheriff John Flynn, recent past president of the Massachusetts
Sheriffs Association. ``But I don't fault (Hodgson) if he thinks
that is good. These people committed a crime and they owe society.
I am not worried about degrading inmates.''
</P>
<P>
   Flynn said he sends out up to 50 prerelease inmates in crews to
paint municipal buildings and undertake other public projects. Like
other work crews, his are made up of inmates with six months or
less left to serve, and though they are supervised, they are not in
restraints. Their incentive to flee is considered minimal since
they are near the end of their jail terms.
</P>
<P>
   The chain gang program meshes with the get-tough policies
Hodgson launched as soon as he took over as sheriff. He took away
many inmate privileges, including smoking, television, and weights.
He started charging inmates $5 for medical visits and haircuts.
Also, he increased education programs and offered weekend religious
retreats in the prison gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
   Hodgson is also considering a chain gang for the 70 women jailed
in Bristol County.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no play time anymore when you come to jail,'' he
said. ``The system basically set up inmates for failure. We told
them we would pay for everything and that they didn't have to do a
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that the public may have to get used to seeing
the inmates chained together. In fact, he prefers to avoid the term
``chain gang.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to call them chain gangs since that relies on
old images and is associated with being cruel,'' he said. ``We are
giving them a portable restraint and are using their talents to get
more done for the community. They have to be restrained because of
the time they have left'' to serve.

   OVER FITCHBURG, Mass. _ Randy Blume is at the controls of a
rented Piper Warrior II, and despite the fact that it's been a few
years since she's flown single-engine four-seaters, it is clear
that the air _ from a pilot's seat _ is her element.
</P>
<P>
   Blume is making this hop out to Fitchburg and back to help
promote her just-published first novel, ``Crazy in the Cockpit.''
Even with her worn leather flying jacket _ a souvenir from when she
flew 727s out of Guam for Continental _ tossed in a back seat,
Blume looks the part, with a face permanently weathered from years
of sitting in sun-drenched cockpits and eyes that instinctively
squint when she takes off her blue-tinted shades.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking into her classic David Clark headset, she reminds her
passenger, ``Keep a lookout for traffic, will you?''
</P>
<P>
   That's because the small Fitchburg airfield, nestled in a bowl
just outside of downtown, is ``uncontrolled,'' which means there is
no control tower to alert pilots to other aircraft in the vicinity.
</P>
<P>
   Then _ perhaps because the 5-foot-2 Blume, ``barely,'' she says
ruefully, has to take one hand off the controls to pull herself up
enough to look out over the rounded top edge of the instrument
panel _ another request: ``Look out, too, will you, for a place we
can land. That's always good to know in case the engine quits.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a good football field?'' her passenger asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big plowed field is better,'' Blume replies.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

<P>
   The exchange could have come right out of ``Crazy in the
Cockpit.''

   &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I filled out the landing data form and passed it to Neil.
``There seem to be wild pigs on the runway,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wild pigs?'' he asked. ``What does that mean?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It means we should overfly the runway and take a look,''
Duncan said, scratching his armpit and then sniffing his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Neil assented, and I told (the air traffic controller) our
plans, then made an announcement on the PA explaining to the
passengers what we'd be doing.
</P>
<P>
   When we flew over the runway, and sure enough, there was a group
of pigs sitting on the tarmac.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bummer,'' Neil said, looking uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Try buzzing them off,'' Duncan suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Neil descended to 500 feet and roared across the runway.
</P>
<P>
   The pigs didn't move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought pigs were supposed to be smart,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are smart,'' Duncan said. ``They know precisely where to
sit to block the runway.''

<P>
   Randy Blume, 38, is a confessed teenage bookworm and the
daughter of author Judy Blume. That she wrote a novel _ even a
novel about a woman who chooses flying over law _ should come as no
big surprise.
</P>
<P>
   But that she was the young woman who chose flight school over
law school takes some explaining. ``I knew it was totally alien to
the way I was brought up,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Blume, who now lives in Cambridge, Mass., grew up in suburban
New Jersey and, after her mother divorced and remarried, Los
Alamos. Blume's father is a New York lawyer. She says that she was
probably always interested in airplanes _ ``It's what I remember
from going on vacations,'' she says. But more to the point, halfway
through high school, she discovered adventure through an Outward
Bound course. She was, Blume recalls, the petite tenderfoot who
fell over backwards when she first hitched a backpack over her
shoulders. But, she adds, ``I went from being the last person in
line with people yelling at me to catch up, (to) being the
leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendra, her heroine pilot in ``Crazy in the Cockpit,'' discovers
the lure of flying as an assignment for a college journalism
course. ``But I didn't go into flying to have something to write
about,'' Blume says.
</P>
<P>
   It was even more serendipitous than that. During her junior year
at Wesleyan University, in Middletown, Conn., a roommate's
boyfriend reported that he had taken flying lessons over the summer
and had ``soloed.'' On the strength of just that, Blume went up for
one lesson at Hartford's old Brainard Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was cool enough that I wanted to do it again,'' she says.
``I became totally obsessed. I read flying magazines tucked inside
textbooks. I wrote all my papers about flying. And I knew that I
wanted to be an airline pilot.''
</P>
<P>
   She had her private pilot's license by the time she graduated in
1983. That summer at her mother's vacation home on Martha's
Vineyard, when she was supposed to be getting ready for law school,
she was spending all her earnings on flying magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's what you want to do . . . '' she remembers her
mother saying. ``And that was all the permission I needed,'' says
the daughter. (Judy Blume did exercise some veto power over the
choice of a flying school, looking askance at flying-magazine
advertisements that featured ``come fly with me'' bikinied young
women.)

   ``How could this have happened?'' my mother wailed when I'd told
her I was deferring graduate school to become a professional pilot.
``I've sent you to the best schools. I took you to museums,
concerts, the theater. I kept the house filled with books. I didn't
let you watch TV or eat Twinkies. Where did I go wrong?''

   The question of the mother-daughter relationship seems to touch
a nerve. The inevitable question: ``How much of the book is real?''
brings a carefully considered response.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flying is all true,'' she says. ``It's pretty much exactly
as it happened. It's pretty hard to make too much up in this book.
I suppose I could have, but I've flown into those towns and I've
flown those planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the people are composites,'' she says. ``Especially the
mother. It's very important that I say that.''
</P>
<P>
   And just as ``there are a few lines in her books that are things
that I had said,'' Blume says, recalling that Judy Blume's classic
``Blubber'' is based on an incident in school she told her mother
about, ``there are a few lines that my mother said that got into my
book.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she adds emphatically, ``the mother character is not my
mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Judy Blume, incidentally, does not like flying _ even in
commercial jets.
</P>
<P>
   Blume has flown her father, John Blume, around to legal
appointments in southern California but she has taken her mother up
only once, a spin out over San Francisco Bay. ``I think she thought
it was a mother thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Blume is divorced and is raising her son, Elliot, as a single
mother. ``One spring day when I was still married and living in
Beverly, I grabbed Elliot, who was 3, and took him flying with
me.''
</P>
<P>
   `` `Isn't this cool?' I asked him when we came down. `I don't
see what's so cool about it,' he said. `I have to sit in my car
seat just like in the car.' ''

   In the dream, I was flying a jet for a major airline. I was the
captain, but the first officer was telling me what to do because my
uniform hat (which had been designed for a man) kept slipping over
my eyes and I couldn't see. We were flying low, over the ocean, and
it was very dark. I was nervous because I didn't know how to land a
jet, but the first officer said we wouldn't have to worry about
landing if we just flew under the water. I didn't think the
airplane was supposed to get wet, but I pushed the control wheel
forward anyway. Just as the water started to splash over the
windshield, the phone rang.
</P>
<P>
   ``Want a charter?'' It was Dale, one of the pilots for Golden
Gate Aviation . . . where I was the senior charter pilot and,
because there weren't many charters, also a flight instructor.

   After two and a half years of flying for Continental Airlines,
Blume gave it up in 1989 to get pregnant. ``My obstetrician asked,
`How can you get pregnant if you're away four nights a week?' I was
flying for Continental out of Newark and was pretty senior, but it
wasn't working too well for my marriage and the airline lifestyle
was not the way I wanted to raise a child.''
</P>
<P>
   So, out of the job she loved, Blume started to write about it.
The book could have been a memoir, but publisher DK Ink wanted a
novel, and that's how it turned out.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Blume says, ``for the first time since I left, I'm really
starting to consider going back to flying. Elliot's life is stable,
he's going into second grade. I could go back to flight instructing
tomorrow, but I wouldn't make enough to pay the baby sitter. What
I'd love is to be on call for a charter company.''
</P>
<P>
   The love is still palpable as Randy Blume reminisces for a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first commuter job was for East Hampton Air on Long
Island,'' she recalls. ``It was a 15-seat turboprop, and I couldn't
believe they were letting me do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then at Continental, I couldn't believe that they let me
take this 727, this big fun airplane.
</P>
<P>
   ``It still holds that appeal.''

   The interphone rang (interrupting our cockpit waterfight), and I
picked it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going on up there?'' Milli asked. I've got 21 medical
emergencies, and now Paulina is crying in the galley, saying we're
all going to die. Can I get a little reassurance, please?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's fine,'' I said, choking back hysterics. ``I can't
imagine what she's talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   And suddenly, everything was fine. We were going to get to
Honolulu, and I was going to make it to Boston. Within a few months
I would be upgrading to first officer. . . .
</P>
<P>
   By the time Diamond Head came into sight, we'd cleaned up the
cockpit and dried off as well as we could. We all had wet sticky
hair, but we were too tired to care. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Are all Atoll Locals like this one?'' Neil asked as we taxied
to the gate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atoll Locals are just like any other kind of flying,'' Duncan
said. ``Boring in the back, crazy in the cockpit.''

<HEADLINE>
KEEPING `CRISPY' IN ITS PLACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Crispy is an easy word to hate, especially for food editors, who
see it on their plates week after week. Everyday word watchers
seem, on the whole, acclimated _ or resigned _ to seeing it
encroach on crisp. The last recorded complaint I know of went to
William Safire in 1985, and the New York Times wordsman seconded
his reader's objection: crispy, he concluded, ``is an itsy-pooism''
and should be resisted.
</P>
<P>
   Resistance is probably futile, 70 years after Rice Krispies came
into the language; even England has had the cereal of Snap,
Crackle, and Pop since 1928. But Helen Grove of Tucson is not ready
to surrender. ``Crispy sounds wispy to me,'' she wrote recently.
``Crisp sounds _ well _ crisp.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it sounded a bit too crisp to Kellogg when the company set
out to market its ``talking'' cereal to the masses. Adding the y _
as in mommy, daddy, bunny, kitty _ gives the word a fond, familiar
flavor; that's what diminutives are for, after all. Swanson used
the same strategy in a 1954 ad, deploying warm and cozy buzzwords
to sell us frozen chicken pies: ``Real Oldtime Goodness . . .
tender chicken _ crispy crust. You just brown 'n serve!'' Soon
enough, editors were using the word too: ``Want Your Hash Crispy
Brown?'' asked a 1959 Globe headline over a collection of
Confidential Chat cooking tips. And the Chinese food invasion was
getting under way, bringing crispy noodles to far suburbia.
</P>
<P>
   If ever a word looked like 20th-century adspeak, crispy is it.
But though it got its big break in the 20th century, thanks to food
branding and advertising, crispy is no arriviste: Someone
itsy-pooed crisp _ from the Latin for ``curled'' _ back in 1398,
writing of hair that was ``cryspy and curlyd.'' The earliest uses
of crispy describe hairstyles and ocean waves, not food _ and
sometimes it looks as if crispy is chosen just to add a syllable to
a line of poetry _ but there they are, more English than you and I.
(Or you and me, depending on your feelings about than as a
preposition.)
</P>
<P>
   Later, crispy gravitated toward food contexts, the dominant use
today. Sometimes crispy is metaphorically stretched but holds onto
its cooking associations _ a crispy tan (1977), crispy meaning
burned out (allegedly college slang of the '80s, somewhere). Crispy
critter, says slang sleuth Paul Dickson, began as emergency-room
shorthand for a burn patient. In England, where potato chips are
crisps, a slang word for paper money is crispies _ a delicious
correspondence, though of course there may be no intuitive
connection. Americans weren't thinking of potato chips, after all,
when they said he's in the chips; our food words for money are
dough, bread, lettuce.
</P>
<P>
   Science has even taken an interest in what makes a food
``crisp'' (or ``crispy'' _ for these purposes, either will do). For
her doctoral thesis at Cornell, Zata Vickers _ trying to discover
what ``crisp'' dry popcorn and ``crisp'' wet carrot sticks had in
common _ took oscilloscope readings of the sounds various foods
made when she bit them. Crisp foods, it turned out, were generally
bitten with the front teeth; crunchy foods involved molars and
jawbones. Rice Krispies, she told a reporter, ``make too light a
sound to be crunchy. If our language used masculine and feminine
genders, crisp would be feminine and crunch would be masculine.''
(Not necessarily true, but then, she's a food scientist, not a
language professor.)
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, crispy strikes out in a new, non-food direction.
Why would it be a synonym for ``horribly hung over,'' as a 1988
college slang source claimed? (If it was, its moment seems to have
passed.) And just this spring, reporting on the Oscar telecast, a
Globe reporter wrote that ``Joan Rivers kept her Geena Davis quips
constant and quite crispy.'' Though you can push crispy in the
direction of possible synonyms _ sharp, tart, barbed _ the examples
suggest that another word (rhymes with witchy) was what the writer
really yearned for.
</P>
<P>
   If your anti-crispy sentiments remain strong, history or no,
there's bad news: The word has continued to spread in the '90s.
Annual use in this newspaper is three or four times as frequent as
it was in the '80s (though the peak year was 1995, so perhaps the
worst is over). The good news is that crispy is rarely allowed out
of the food corral, and if it stays there, it's tolerable enough.
But let's not have any crispy salutes, or trouser creases, or
autumn days; some things just aren't the same without that edge.

<HEADLINE>
A GUIDE TO SPOTTING MOOSE IN NEW ENGLAND 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE DANIEL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now I know what to tell my friends who visit Maine in hopes of
seeing moose and return disappointed because the only ones they
spotted were inside local gift shops: Go to New Hampshire. In
reality, the truth lies somewhere in between.
</P>
<P>
   There may be 35,000 moose in Maine compared with about 10,000 in
the Granite State, but on a moose mission last summer, I saw more
in New Hampshire. Yet that's not to say there weren't out and about
in Maine, and Vermont as well.
</P>
<P>
   After years of feeling let down because I'd seen only two moose
during 20 times as many trips to Maine, I figured I'd let the
experts help _ and it paid off. These days moose are a big tourist
draw, so towns and businesses are aiming to please by pointing the
way to hangouts and offering official moose tours by boat, bus, and
even plane. So follow me, and if you're as lucky as I was, you'll
see more moose than you ever thought possible. &QL; 
 &QL; 
NEW HAMPSHIRE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   First stop, Gorham _ at the top of White Mountain National
Forest _ a small town near countless hiking trails in the
Presidential range, several spots for cross-country and downhill
skiing, and the auto road and cog railway to the top of Mount
Washington. The town, about a 3 1/2-hour drive from Boston and 30
miles north of the more well-known North Conway, also is home to
Northern Forest Moose Tours ($15 adults, $10 kids 12 and younger),
a minibus tour that follows Route 16 north to visit favorite haunts
of these gentle giants. Run by the Northern White Mountain Chamber
of Commerce, the tour has a 95 percent success rate of spotting
moose, and even offers a raincheck if you don't see any.
</P>
<P>
   Our ride, which lasted from 6 p.m. to almost 10 (so eat early)
first took us through the ``Paper City,'' Berlin (pronounced
BER-lin), and along the Androscoggin River. Over the years, Berlin
Mills scientists patented more than 600 products, including paper
towels and cooking shortening; today, the largest employer in the
city is Crown Vantage Pulp &AMP; Paper Mills. The Northern Forest
Heritage Park in Berlin offers mill tours and features an
old-fashioned logging exhibit, and every August it hosts a popular
logging competition and festival.
</P>
<P>
   Because most moose activity is at night, we didn't really get
down to business until almost dark. In New Hampshire, spotlights
are allowed in the woods until Aug. 31. After that, mating season,
or rutting, begins and ``illuminating'' wildlife is not allowed.
Even with lights, it's not always easy to spot moose in the woods
unless you catch their eyes, which reflect brightly. The key, of
course, is to gravitate around the bogs, where moose like to muck
about and feed off the vegetation. Popular moose bogs often are
along the road, because the moose like a little salt with their
meals.
</P>
<P>
   During the bus tour, guide and driver taught us much about moose
and even passed around an antler _ weighing 65 pounds. Racks grow
each year from May to December, then drop off, so keep your eyes
open during winter hikes and you might find one. (Good luck fitting
it in your backpack.)
</P>
<P>
   One thing all moose tours have in common is the suspense. Will
we see one? When? Where? After two hours of the guide shining the
spotlight in the woods as we inched up and then back down the
desolate stretch of highway _ nothing. Not to be deterred, we
headed back to Berlin and hit Success Road, just outside of town.
It lived up to its name. We stopped at a roadside bog and the
spotlight hit not one but three calves and a cow (female moose). We
poured out of the van, popping photos left and right while dodging
swooping bats. The moose didn't budge. Some locals drove by,
telling us there were more moose just up the road, and so we walked
the few feet up to the next bog and, sure enough, there were a cow
and calf.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, my motel, the Town &AMP; Country Motor Inn in Shelburne,
which borders Gorham, was open for dinner until 10 p.m. and I made
it back just in time for a tasty victory dinner. First moose
mission accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   The next day included a lovely drive up Route 16 to Route 26 in
Errol and over to Colebrook, then up Route 3 to Pittsburg. Not only
did I pass many Moose Crossing signs, several of them said ``Active
Moose Crossing.'' Those were at bogs clearly frequented by moose _
hoofprints were on top of each other in the muck. Here I stayed at
the Timberland Lodge &AMP; Cabins on First Connecticut Lake, about five
miles north of town. Pittsurg is the state's largest town in area _
about 360 square miles _ and one of its most sparsely populated.
It's bordered by Maine, Vermont, and Quebec, is unspoiled,
unpretentious, and even primitive, at least for now. My
squeaky-clean cabin was about 100 yards from the lake in as serene
a setting as I could have hoped for.
</P>
<P>
   Having arrived in early afternoon, I took what turned out to be
a very wet bicycle ride along ``Moose Alley,'' Route 3 about 20
miles north to the Canadian border. I spotted no moose, but did see
a deer. Bicycling was pleasant because of the low volume of
traffic, but cars traveled quite fast and a few logging trucks
barreled by. My hosts, Doug and Linda Feltmate, assured me I would
see moose at some bogs about two miles north of the Timberland
turnoff. I hardly saw a soul all day, but as soon as dusk hit, cars
were driving up and down Moose Alley on the lookout. I decided to
stick with one spot, and pulled out a lawn chair, a flashlight, and
bug repellent _ and the wait began. Sure enough, as soon as
darkness began to fall, there was a rustle and there they were _ a
cow, a calf, and my first bull (male moose) sighting ever. They
stayed near the back of the bog while folks who'd parked or were
driving slowly by shone their high-power lights on them. Finally
everyone got bored and left for others bogs, but I stayed put. I
couldn't see a thing, and my little flashlight was useless more
than a few feet away. Just gazing at the brilliant, star-laden sky
and breathing in the fresh air was a delight. Then I heard the
squishing sound of a moose walking through the bog. It stopped a
few feet from me and proceeding to graze in a most noisy,
unmannered fashion. It was exciting to be so close to such a huge
beast and really listen to its sounds. Before long, a car with a
spotlight inched by and suddenly there it was, illuminated _ a huge
bull moose with a marvelously wide rack just a few feet from my
face. It looked up and I was awestruck. Friends later asked if I
was scared. No, because moose don't naturally attack people, unless
you disturb their mating or their offspring. Later that night, I
lay on a dock at the Timberland, listened to the mournful cry of
loons, and even saw the northern lights.
</P>
<P>
   The next day I left Pittsburg, stopping in town to eat the best
and biggest blueberry pancakes I've ever had at Mariah's
Restaurant, connected to the general store. I missed the annual
Moose Festival by two days. Held in Pittsburg, Colebrook, and
neighboring Canaan, Vt., and sponsored by the North Country Chamber
of Commerce, it features a moose calling contest, moose stew
cook-off, guided moose tours, and of course a parade of ``mock
moose''; i.e., locals in costume.
</P>
<P>
   Going back south, I wended my way to The Balsams, spectacularly
set in the mountains in Dixville Notch. At this grand resort I have
to admit that I was more interested in the mousse than the moose,
and saw more of the former as well. Not that there aren't moose in
the area _ one wandered into the Balsams' drained swimming pool in
spring '98 and they had to lift it out with a crane. The resort,
which follows the prix fixe American Plan Hospitality, began in
1866 as a summer inn. Now it can accommodate more than 400 guests
and features skiing, golf, mountain biking, nature walks, and a
host of other activities and cruise-ship type amenities. The food
is exquisite, and the midday grand buffet, set out on a
100-foot-long table, attracts scores of visitors from miles
around. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MAINE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maine is synonymous with moose, and tourists get mighty
disappointed when they don't see them, which is often the case. Go
as far north as Baxter State Park (where I saw my first moose in
the wild 10 years ago), outside of Millinocket or Moosehead Lake
and your luck will grow. After hearing about Moosehead Lake for
years, I figured it would be teeming with tourists. I was
delightfully surprised to find the lake surrounded by mostly woods,
and once outside of the small, charming but not touristy town of
Greenville, the area was largely uninhabited.
</P>
<P>
   Moosehead, 40 miles long, has about 400 miles of shoreline.
Summer tourists come mostly to fish and to see moose. The Moosehead
Lake Region Chamber of Commerce sponsors MooseMainea, a series of
events from mid-May to mid-June, which helps kick off tourist
season. One of the busiest moose-watching operations runs out of
the Birches Resort in Rockwood, where I stayed. Rockwood is 20
miles north of Greenville on the western shore and home to many
rustic facilities for outdoorspeople. The Birches, on the narrowest
part of the lake, is across from Mount Kineo, a small but steep
mountain made of flintlike volcanic rock that rises vertically out
of the lake. A sporting camp built in the 1930s, the Birches has
simple, charming housekeeping cabins just a few feet from the water
and a few ``cabin tents'' with beds and standing room set back in
the woods. It also makes available several yurts, tepee-like
structures set deep in the woods, and has a good restaurant that
overlooks the lake and Kineo.
</P>
<P>
   During a morning mountain bike ride (rentals available). I
spotted a deer and a fox but, alas, no moose. Around noon I drove
to Greenville to go on the Moose Watch offered by Folsom's Air
Service. We took off from the lake in a tiny float plane and got a
different perspective of Moosehead Lake. At one point our pilot did
a hard bank, swooped down, and pointed out a moose standing in the
middle of a bog, eating away. The ride was a little bumpy, a little
nerve-racking, but mostly thrilling, especially taking off and
landing on the water.

 UNDATED: ... on the water.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Feeling lucky, that evening I took the Birches' popular Moose
Cruise on a pontoon boat, open to the public as well as to guests.
After about 30 minutes, we were in Socatean Stream, a shallow area
of heavy woods and tiny islands of vegetation _ and no people in
sight. Again, the suspense. Will we see a moose? Before long, a
sighting! A cow and her calf, feeding on a small island, spotted us
just as we spotted them and crossed the shallow sandbar,
hightailing it into the thick woods. Later we saw another mother
and calf feeding in the water, just on shore's edge, and, for an
added bonus, we also spied a bald eagle perched high in a dead
tree.
</P>
<P>
   The next day a guide, myself, and another Birches guest went by
one-person sea kayaks back to where the pontoon boat had gone. The
August day was perfect, with next to no wind. The air was so clear
we could see Mount Katahdin, in Baxter State Park, far in the
distance to the northwest. As we begin to paddle around a maze of
tiny islands and a zigzagging coastline, there she was _ a cow
feeding near the shoreline. We watched for a while, as she made her
way across the water and headed back into the woods. After about
three hours of easy paddling, we stopped for a picnic (provided by
the Birches) near Socatean Falls. We weren't in any danger of going
over _ the falls were underwater after a summer of rain.
</P>
<P>
   Paddling back, I was ahead of the group for a while, feeling
like an explorer, perhaps because I was only a few hours from the
trail Henry David Thoreau took across Moosehead Lake, which he
wrote about in ``The Maine Woods.'' I rounded a thick clump of
vegetation and it was all I could do to keep from shouting in glee.
Not more than 25 yards ahead was a moose standing in about two feet
of water and eating aquatic plants to her heart's content. I
signaled to the others and we slowly paddled forward in silence. We
stayed near the beautiful creature for about 30 minutes, and at
times I was so close I was afraid the wind would lift my kayak and
deposit me right at her feet. She would occasionally look up at us
but seemed completely complacent. As we paddled away I looked back
and she was still lazily munching the greenery.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks later, in early October, I went to Rangeley to catch
the always spectacular fall foliage. Rangeley, another
unpretentious small town, is about 150 miles southwest of Moosehead
by back roads. It's closer to where I was in New Hampshire, only 30
miles east of Colebrook. I've been visiting Rangeley for many years
with a friend who has a summer house there. On a bike ride up Route
4 a few years ago, I spotted my second moose (and a fox, porcupine,
deer, and otter), but I'm sorry to report that no more were to be
seen on this visit. We took a few drives along routes 4, 16, and
17, prime moose areas, and some friends went on the dawn Moose
Cruise arranged by the lovely Rangeley Inn on the Kennebago River.
They saw a blue heron but no moose, however they reported that the
two-hour canoe trip was worth getting up before dark because the
scenery was so beautiful. (They also were thrilled that guide Rich
Gacki showed up with coffee and homemade muffins.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
VERMONT &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vermont is more known for cows than moose, but it has both. The
area you're most likely to find moose in is the Northeast Kingdom,
so dubbed in 1949 to describe the 1,500-square-mile northeast
corner of the state. I spent a day in tiny Island Pond, surrounded
by unspoiled beauty and, of course, many moose bogs. (There also
are roadside bogs in nearby Norton and Averill.)
</P>
<P>
   My room at the Lakefront Motel faced Island Pond; that alone was
worth the drive. I spent the day on my bicycle, headed north on
Route 114, site of many of the bogs. Traffic was light and the
scenery, mostly unspoiled farmland and woods, was just what I'd
hoped for. As I rounded one corner and came upon a large bog
saturated with moose tracks, there they were, a moose and her calf
feeding, half hidden behind the brush. Just as I stopped to watch,
she spied me and off they went. I rode to the Canadian Border and
was able to go through the tiny Canadian town of Stanhope without
becoming official _ no, you can't leave Stanhope without going
through the border police. Stanhope and Norton, in Vermont, share
municipal offices _ both the maple leaves and the stars and stripes
fly outside the building.
</P>
<P>
   I returned to the bogs that evening hoping to see moose at dusk
or at least hear them in the dark. Unlike New Hampshire, Vermont
does not allow spotlights in the woods, so you're on your own. I
seemed to be the only moose watcher in sight, or maybe everyone
else was out where the moose were because I didn't see or hear any,
despite sitting on the edge of an active bog. Before leaving town
the next morning I consoled myself by buying two pairs of clogs at
Simon the Tanner, a discount shoe and clothing store run by The
Twelve Tribes, a religious community. A nice way to rejoin
civilization is to follow one of the routes from ``A Day in the
Kingdom'' self-guided driving tours published by the Northeast
Kingdom Travel and Tourism Association. I particularly enjoyed the
``Victorian View'' route. The only thing missing were the moose.

A BIT OF MOOSE NATURAL HISTORY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Females are called cows and males are bull moose. Offspring
are calves, year-olds are yearlings.
</P>
<P>
   --Mating season is mid-September to mid-October and moose are
born in late May to early June.
</P>
<P>
   --They shed their winter coats May through June, and look ragged
during the molting period. Antlers are shed each winter
</P>
<P>
   --Mature bull moose stand as tall as 7 feet at the shoulder,
with legs as long as 40 inches. Mature bulls typically weigh 1,000
to 1,200 pounds, cows 700 to 900 pounds. From nose to tail, mature
moose can be 10 feet long. A mature bull's rack spread can be 60
inches or more and reach more than 10 feet off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   M--oose will eat some 40 to 50 pounds a day.
</P>
<P>
   T--heir hearing and smell are excellent but they could use
glasses.
</P>
<P>
   --Moose live about 20 years or more and have no natural enemies,
but beware the protective mother and the rutting male. Of course,
the biggest danger moose pose to humans is on the highways, hence
the many caution signs in moose territory. When its moose vs. car,
moose often wins, so drive with caution. &QL;

RUSSIA'S `GOOD MORNING' COUPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Like all loving spouses, Yekaterina and Alexander
``Sasha'' Strizhenov have their share of spats. Unlike most
couples, the Strizhenovs air their differences each Wednesday in
front of a nationwide audience that has just dragged itself out of
bed.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, the Strizhenovs somehow manage to have little
disagreements without botching the assignment at hand: making
</P>
<P>
   sure millions of Russians start their day on an upbeat note, no
easy task in this perennially crisis-stricken land.
</P>
<P>
   And what may seem really strange _ all this works as good TV.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday is the day the Strizhenovs host the popular ``Good
Morning'' show on Russian Public Television, the network that
reaches most of Russia's 147 million viewers and a sizable chunk of
the rest of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Both accomplished stage and film actors, the Strizhenovs add a
little ``Family Ties'' to a format that is equal parts ``The Today
Show'' and ``Regis and Kathy Lee.'' Judging from their fan mail, it
is a successful mix.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday is only one day in the life of the Strizhenovs,
perhaps the hardest-working couple in Russian show business.
</P>
<P>
   Yekaterina, 30, has the kind of face you are sure you have seen
before. And, if you live in Moscow, you probably have: as Mama Nina
in the Russian version of ``Sesame Street,'' in 30 feature films,
numerous plays, and in ads for shampoo and ketchup. Soon, she'll be
seen in a television series she is currently shooting in Odessa,
Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, also 30, has the pedigree. He was born into a family
of famous actors, and, in the recent words of the Russian edition
of Cosmopolitan magazine, ``poured from the same mold as Leonardo
DiCaprio.'' He studied at Juilliard. Like Yekaterina, Alexander has
starred in a number of films _ four with his wife, including a
screen version of Hamlet in which she played Ophelia and he played
her brother, Laertes. He just finished a six-year run as Christian
in a popular Moscow stage production of ``Cyrano de Bergerac,'' all
while finding time to set up and run an advertising agency.
</P>
<P>
   So why does this busy acting couple need to host a TV show?
</P>
<P>
   ``Money,'' the Strizhenovs answered unanimously in a recent
interview in the cafeteria at the Moscow House of Cinematography,
where Russia's rich and famous dine in, well, relative squalor.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Good Morning' pays the bills,'' Yekaterina said, before
Alexander, as he tends to do on the air, cuts her off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It pays the bills,'' Alexander interjects. ``The film industry
is not what it used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union (and the end to 100
percent state funding for movies), the storied Russian film
industry has fallen on hard times. While Russia still puts out a
few quality films a year, most of the work available is in cheap,
violent crime flicks. These are tough times for actors, even if you
are one of Russia's most recognizable couples.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's put it this way,'' Alexander said, lighting up his
umpteenth Marlboro Light of the conversation. ``By American
standards, we should probably drive around in a limousine. When I
explained to some American friends who my father is (Oleg
Strizhenov, one of Russia's most famous actors), they were like,
`Wow, you must have a villa on your own private island in the
Pacific, like Marlon Brando.' ''
</P>
<P>
   There are no limousines or private islands in the Strizhenovs'
life. They will not say what they earn, citing a ``commercial
secret'' clause the television station forces its personalities to
sign, although they clearly live more comfortably than the average
Russian.
</P>
<P>
   ``But stardom is much, much different here,'' said Yurate
Gurauskaite, culture editor at the Russian edition of Vogue
magazine. For one thing, most Russian actors, even those who are
successful on TV and in films, still consider stage acting to be
the most important measure of prestige, a function of Moscow's
world-famous theater scene. In today's Russia, there is no such
thing as a ``box-office hit.''
</P>
<P>
   And there are those bills to pay. The Strizhenovs, especially
Yekaterina, have been adept at adapting to market realities.
</P>
<P>
   This is where ``Good Morning'' came in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone had the idea of taking a couple who turns the show
into their own little guest room,'' Alexander said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're there to give people something optimistic to start the
day,'' added Yekaterina.
</P>
<P>
   You get an idea of how hard that is when you visit Ostankino,
the cheerless studio headquarters of Russian Public Television.
Stern police toting Uzis guard the entrance. Unlit hallways weave
like a complicated Kremlin plot past spartan and decrepit offices.
</P>
<P>
   But the studio of ``Good Morning'' is all day-glo yellow chairs,
yellow walls, faux windows with bright city scenes painted on them.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere on the air is similarly bright and surprisingly
laid-back. The Strizhenovs' show is full of lifestyle features and
practical information, like what to cook for breakfast and when to
plant your cucumbers, as well as an ecletic collection of music
videos and movie reviews.
</P>
<P>
   This past Wednesday, an unusually blustery May morning that
found Moscow deep in a government crisis, was also the anniversary
of the founding of the Young Pioneers, the Soviet version of the
Boy and Girl Scouts. That was the theme the Strizhenovs went with.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of Russians look back fondly on their Pioneer days, even
though other Russians believe the Pioneers were one of the ways the
Soviet regime prepared children to be good communists.
</P>
<P>
   Yekaterina wore pony tails and the red tie of the Young
Pioneers. Sasha Strizhenov wore a dubious expression.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember that what irritated me about the Pioneers is no one
cared about what you thought, they were interested in what you were
able to parrot,'' Alexander started.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I don't know about that, Sasha,'' interjected Yekaterina.
``Maybe you had a bad Pioneer organization in your school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to a good school,'' harumphed Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I had a happy childhood as a Pioneer,'' Yekaterina said,
turning to a feature on the history of the Pioneers as the studio
guest waited patiently to get a word in edgewise.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers across Russia eat this stuff up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get letters all the time from people who ask, `How do you
make it work?' '' Yekaterina said.
</P>
<P>
   It is a good question, especially given the high divorce rate in
the world among actors. The Strizhenovs have been together since
they met at age 14 on the set of one of their early films, a drama
called ``The Leader.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not an ideal pair,'' Yekaterina said. ``Sometimes,
Sasha doesn't let me get a word in. But he is a great partner.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the Strizhenovs wonder if there is not a better life
elsewhere. Alexander recently flirted with Hollywood when he nearly
landed the part of a Russian living in Alaska in a film version of
``Grizzly Adams.'' But the project folded and Alexander came home.
It was probably for the better, Yekaterina said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better to be stars in Russia,'' she said, ``than workers at a
carwash in New York.''

NO SUCH THING AS A FREE PLANE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Joel Klein, the assistant attorney general for antitrust who
has Microsoft Corp. on the run, earlier this month accused American
Airlines of driving upstart competitors out of business at its
Dallas-Fort Worth hub.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department accused the airline of slashing fares and
adding flights when three low-price airlines started flying from
its hometown airport, then raising prices again when they left. The
intent, said the complaint, was to preserve the artificially high
profits of a near-monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   The suit raised eyebrows. There have been few predatory pricing
complaints since the Reagan administration, when the largely
nonpartisan ``law and economics'' movement brought a new
sophistication about economic analysis to the federal bench and
bar. The suit is the first brought against an airline since the
industry was deregulated in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Former US Solicitor General Robert Bork, who represents American
Airlines, was quick to claim that the government's case ``attempts
to revive a long-discredited, anticonsumer theory of
monopolization.''
</P>
<P>
   But those who think there is nothng new in antitrust economics
since the legendary Aaron Director taught the subject in the 1950s
and 1960s at the University of Chicago law school are in for a big
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   They probably include American Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Take what appears to be the central tenet of the government
case. To prove a violation of the Sherman Act, government lawyers
must show that American's fares _ which matched but did not go
below its competitors' fares _ were below American's ``average
variable costs'' for the routes.
</P>
<P>
   In determining those costs, the government wants to include the
costs of the resources shifted to the new routes from other parts
of the far-flung American empire _ especially the ``ownership
costs'' of additional aircraft, in the form of their short-term
rental equivalents.
</P>
<P>
   Only by omitting such costs from its accounting formula can
American claim to be pricing at and not below average variable
cost, says the government.
</P>
<P>
   Bork opposes this ``creative redefinition.'' There is no
rent-a-plane company that would enable airlines to vary the size of
their fleet on short notice, he says. Therefore the measure of what
it would cost to lease a similar plane is without meaning.
Ownership cost is ``a figment of antitrust imagination,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Yet rental equivalence has become a familiar concept in
measurement economics during the last 30 years, employed in gauging
everything from tax liabilities to the consumer price index and the
cost of capital, to say nothing of its widespread use in contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Requiring American to impute a cost to the airplanes it shifts
around to meet increased competition is the opposite of unfair; it
is sound business practice.
</P>
<P>
   There is, after all, no such thing as a free airplane.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of ownership costs is just the beginning of American's
peril. Microeconomics has changed steadily in the past fifteen
years.
</P>
<P>
   Our understanding of networks and how they may be used to
diminish competition is greatly enhanced, thanks to increasingly
ventilated issues in telecommunications, computers, credit cards,
and now, airline hubs.
</P>
<P>
   The government's case has a long way to go. It is one thing to
assert that ownership costs are relevant in computing the cost of
flying a route. It is quite another to demonstrate that the ability
to disguise and bear such short-term costs is one of the ways a
dominant company creates barriers to entry. But that is why the
Amertican Airlines case is being so widely followed.
</P>
<P>
   It is still possible to find analysts who, like Bork, blithely
assert that true predatory pricing is virtually impossible _ that
the consumer always wins when a dominant competitor cuts prices to
drive a competitor out of business, even if he raises them back up
later. But they are growing fewer _ and older _ all the time.

THE PLAIN TRUTH ABOUT SCHOOL VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Every time there is another outburst of mass
adolescent violence in some quiet, white-bread American town,
Oakland child psychiatrist Herb Schreier gets a spate of phone
calls from reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Dutifully, he answers their questions about ``what kind of kid''
shoots up his high school or plants bombs in his junior high.
</P>
<P>
   Painstakingly, he reminds callers that _ while there is a surge
in school shootings _ official statistics do not support the
existence of an epidemic of teen crime.
</P>
<P>
   Tactfully, Schreier points out that there is a bit of
institutionalized racism in the way the news media sensationalize
shootings of and by middle-class white kids but essentially ignore
minority victims of violence and their attackers.
</P>
<P>
   Patiently, he describes the need for early detection and
treatment _ especially for kids who depend on public health
programs _ and lists the many social and therapeutic approaches
that are proven to work.
</P>
<P>
   Then, almost always, not much happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``These issues are extremely complex,'' Schreier said. ``But
nobody wants to hear that. We reach for very simple-minded
solutions in this country. And the media have a short attention
span.''
</P>
<P>
   As for successful remedies: ``I believe the public wants to hear
more about what can be done, but that doesn't seem to be sexy
enough for the media.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it will be the proverbial cold day in hell before we're
likely to hear a prime time newscast tease with: ``Doctors find
that close supervision and support by just one parent _ from early
age into adolescence _ can lower an at-risk child's criminal
tendencies by 80 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Or imagine a front-page headline that declares: ``Schools with
anti-bullying policies fairly wipe out teen violence.''
</P>
<P>
   In two decades of treating kids at Children's Hospital in
Oakland, Schreier has seen all manner of horror and heartbreak.
</P>
<P>
   As one of only two child psychiatrists on staff, his current
caseload is 200. One violent child, a 3-year-old who was taken to
the clinic for help, already was on his eighth foster home.
</P>
<P>
   Children's Hospital could not take him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The acuity of our kids in our clinic is very high,'' Schreier
said.
</P>
<P>
   But amid the pain, he has also seen reasons to hope. Many lie in
some of the most common, accessible places.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not talking about psychiatric care, I'm talking about
family support,'' Schreier said.
</P>
<P>
   And he is talking about doable things like teaching empathy to
grade school and junior high students. Like schools adopting strong
anti-bullying and anti-harassment policies. Like weekly visits to
teen-age moms by community workers who can teach them parenting
skills. Like public school boards not just talking about full-time
counselors and after-school music and arts programs but making
these necessities a priority in every school.
</P>
<P>
   He is also talking about those of us in the news media owning up
to our share of the responsibility, specifically about the way we
cover _ and cover and cover _ such stories as the school shootings
in Jonesboro, Ark., or Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am no media expert, but every reporter I talk to tells me he
or she feels bad about the way the media sensationalize these
stories. Every reporter is fully aware of the media's
culpability,'' Schreier said. ``But reporters do not determine what
is covered as news.''
</P>
<P>
   Numerous studies, he said, have shown that a significant
decrease in teens taking their own lives occurs when the news media
do not overplay or sensationalize stories of adolescent suicide.
When a story is made into a big deal, the rate increases with
copycat suicides.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called the contagion effect,'' Schreier said. ``And, no,
it is not a large leap of logic to assume that the same thing
happens with teen-age homicides. This is not rocket science.''

   PASADENA, Calif. _ Many of Major League Soccer's best-laid plans
have been marginally successful or have failed. This is to be
expected in a new league. But MLS is going to have even bigger
problems if it continues to allow situations such as the Los
Angeles Galaxy's to disintegrate.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy announced a crowd of 7,581 for their 1-0 victory over
the Revolution Sunday, giving the team a total of 72,000 spectators
for six home games this season. Interest has certainly decreased
since April 13, 1996, when the Galaxy attracted 69,255 for their
first game.
</P>
<P>
   Even more discouraging is that the Galaxy had 21,173 fans on the
same date a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy have been among the league's successful franchises.
The team bonded with the community on opening day and maintained
that bond until this year. But several mistakes were made in recent
months.
</P>
<P>
   Jettisoning captain Dan Calichman disrupted the balance of the
team. But the most costly removals have been the star Hispanic
players, which has led to an alienation from the most fervent and
numerous fans in the United States. Jorge Campos was sent to
Chicago, Eduardo Hurtado to the MetroStars, Martin Machon to Santos
Laguna of Mexico. Then Mauricio Cienfuegos, who can only be
described as beloved by Salvadorans, became a contract holdout.
</P>
<P>
   The week Cienfuegos signed, attendance increased by nearly
10,000 for the next game. But the spell was broken, momentum
disrupted, and the Galaxy's lack of success has once again
engendered apathy.
</P>
<P>
   The poor attendance Sunday occurred on an otherwise encouraging
weekend for MLS. Four of the other five games had crowds of more
than 20,000.
</P>
<P>
   But Los Angeles is a gigantic market for soccer, and it should
have big crowds. Even 20,000 as an average is grossly
underestimating the potential of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy will need to have more of a Latin flavor to tap this
market. Mexican striker Carlos Hermosillo, who will arrive from
Necaxa next week, should help. There is no reason, though, that the
team could not have several Mexican and Central American players.
</P>
<P>
   There are some decent young players on the Galaxy roster, but
the fact is they are not going to sell tickets in great quantities.
</P>
<P>
   The formula for success is simple: Cater to the Hispanic
community and provide a soccer-specific stadium of 40,000 capacity.
Someone rich will become even richer by doing this someday _
hopefully, during the league's lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Bayern Munich favored
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bayern Munich has an advantage over Manchester United going into
Wednesday's Champions League final in Barcelona. The Bavarian club
held a comfortable lead in the German Bundesliga for much of the
season, holds a 12-point edge over Bayer Leverkusen with one match
remaining, and does not play in the Cup final until June 12.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the English Premier League race went to the final
week before Manchester United edged Arsenal for the title. Then,
United played an emotional FA Cup final, defeating Newcastle, 2-0,
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams will be missing key players. But Bayern Munich has
had nearly two months to adjust to the losses of Brazilian striker
Elber and French defender Bixente Lizarazu, while Manchester United
will be without Roy Keane and Paul Scholes (suspended).
</P>
<P>
   Manchester United is rated the most profitable club in the
world, and might have the most fans world-wide. But United has won
the Champions Cup only once, when it defeated Benfica in London in
1968.

STUDENTS' LATEST CAUSE: LABOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Student activism, which subsided on college campuses with the
end of the Vietnam War and the dismantling of apartheid in South
Africa, has resurfaced. And the new causes and commitments would
make any national labor leader proud.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, college students and graduate employees on
campuses from California to Massachusetts have been organizing,
mobilizing, and joining unions to fight for the rights of other
workers, and for their own.
</P>
<P>
   This upsurge in activism and its connection to labor is not
accidental or coincidental. Rather, it is linked to the recent
advent of such training programs as the AFL-CIO's Union Summer, a
four-week internship that puts college students on the nation's
streets and workplaces developing their skills and taking them back
to campus. So far, more than 1,700 young people have been part of
Union Summer since its beginning in 1996, and they have worked in
more than 30 cities. Results of this training and new activism have
been phenomenal.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking higher wages, better health care, more training, and
improved working conditions, about 1,700 graduate teaching
assistants at UCLA voted, by a wide margin, for representation by
the Student Association of Graduate Enployees, an affiliate union
of the United Auto Workers. The union election came after the
state's Public Employment Relations Board basically ruled that the
graduate assistants were not students, but rather real employees
with the right to organize.
</P>
<P>
   If the other UC campuses vote to become a union in upcoming
scheduled elections, more than 9,000 teaching assistants, tutors,
and readers will be represented by the UAW. They will have joined
20 other colleges and universities where graduate teaching
assistants voted for union representation in recent years. The
workers are seeking higher wages, better health care, and more
training through collective bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   Students at more than 25 institutions of higher learning _
including Harvard, Boston College, Boston University, Brown,
Georgetown, and Duke _ have held protests ranging from sit-ins to
teach-ins in an effort to highlight abuses of workers in sweatshops
that make collegiate wear, and to demand a living wage and fair
working conditions for these workers.
</P>
<P>
   They have demanded that firms that license college names not use
sweatshops overseas. The students also called for full disclosure
of the location of the factories making the items imprinted with
their school logos.
</P>
<P>
   At other institutions, students are fighting for the rights of
workers on campus. More than 350 students at Harvard held a rally
earlier this year calling for raises for many of the university's
janitors and dining hall workers. Fairfield University students
held an 11-hour sit-in as part of their quest to have the
university allow 60 janitors to join the Service Employees
International Union. Students at the six Claremont Colleges in
California held a fast to support the right of food service workers
to join a union.
</P>
<P>
   It is certainly no coincidence that Union Summer program
graduates have been among campus activists fighting for workers'
rights at many schools.
</P>
<P>
   As a graduate student from Columbia noted in a recent New York
Times article: ``One of the great untold stories in the '90s is
that Union Summer has created, from almost nothing, activism on
campus to a point where labor issues are among the leading issues
among students today.''
</P>
<P>
   AFL-CIO president John Sweeney said at a press conference
earlier this month in Washington, D.C., that he was ``proud that
many of these students have found training and inspiration through
the AFL-CIO's Union Summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney, the AFL-CIO, and other labor leaders nationwide are
seeing that Union Summer has struck a chord with students on dozens
of college and university campuses. In essence, the AFL-CIO's
program has achieved what many parents, and many colleges and
universities, could not. It has given students something to believe
in _ something to fight for. And labor's future looks as bright as
Union Summer.

REVOLUTION FOLLOWING A FAMILIAR GAME PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The Revolution had little to be encouraged
about after a 1-0 loss to the Los Angeles Galaxy Sunday. They have
earned just 1 point in four games this month. And they appear to be
reverting to some of the habits that caused them to have the worst
record in Major League Soccer last year.
</P>
<P>
   The purposefulness and concentration of the defense has been
replaced by carelessness and missed assignments. They have
surrendered goals in the first 10 minutes of three of the last four
games. They have trailed for 167 of the last 180 minutes, turning
games into uphill battles.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a change in coaches and personnel, though. Maybe,
the coaching combination of Walter Zenga and assistant Giuseppe
Galderisi, plus the addition of midfielder John Harkes can prevent
the Revolution from sliding into lengthy losing streaks, as it did
the last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to see anybody with their head down,'' Galderisi
said. ``We have to believe in ourselves and take responsibility,
show what we have inside. It means work, not just physically, but
also mentally.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to play this game with your mind, otherwise you can
train for five or six hours a day and it won't make any difference.
I only want to see positive people here. Anyone negative can raise
their hand and leave. This is a testing time, a time for
concentration and attention.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution again improvised a starting lineup, their ninth
starting group in nine games. Richard Goulooze probably should not
have been in at the start, since he had missed three games with a
calf strain and was clearly unfit for this contest. Goulooze
started at right back and took the blame for not marking Steve
Jolley on a third-minute corner kick that resulted in the Galaxy's
goal. Paulo Dos Santos replaced Goulooze in the 41st minute and
energized the Revolution. Dos Santos has shown he belongs in the
lineup, or at least as a top substitute.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Burns (hamstring) is expected to return for the
Revolution's visit to the MetroStars Saturday, which should solve
the right back problem. Harkes provided a driving force in
midfield, and once his conditioning improves, he should take
control of the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walter and I are hungry to win, and if the team is hungry,
too, we can finish in a high position in the standings,'' Galderisi
said.

   Adam Stettner racked his brains trying to figure out when it
happened. Could it have been while he was out jogging in the park?
Or when he wandered into the woods near the golf course to hunt
down a stray ball?
</P>
<P>
   Stettner never felt a bite or saw a rash. But sometime during
the summer of 1994, he was bitten by a tick infected with Borrelia
burgdorferi, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few months, the bacterium went to work, stealthily
winding its way through his bloodstream and ultimately wreaking
havoc with his nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I knew anything was wrong was in February
1995,'' Stettner says. ``I was walking down the hall at work and
suddenly the whole office started moving. It was like somebody took
my brain and put it in a blender.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next three years, Stettner submitted to test after test
_ blood chemistries, CT scans, MRIs, spinal taps, anything doctors
could think of to find the cause of his dizziness, nausea, memory
lapses and debilitating fatigue. Finally, down to 130 pounds from
160, he tested positive for Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't wish what happened to me on anybody,'' Stettner
says, a 26-year-old Wall Street trader. ``I lost a part of my life
I can never get back.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent FDA approval of a new Lyme disease vaccine has raised
hopes that stories like Stettner's may someday be relegated to
medical history books.
</P>
<P>
   This year people who live or vacation in tick-infested areas can
take a series of three Lyme immunization shots.
</P>
<P>
   But the good news is tempered by some disquieting facts. The
vaccine is approved only for adults, and it is not fully
protective. One out of five who receive the vaccine and are bitten
by infected ticks will still contract Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, vaccinated people might be tempted to let their guard
down. And this, of all years, is not a time to take chances.
</P>
<P>
   Ecologist Richard Ostfeld, who has spent the better part of the
decade figuring out the boom-and-bust cycles of the Lyme bacterium
as it circulates among ticks, mice and deer, is convinced that the
conditions for spreading the disease will he more dangerous this
summer than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   ``If things go as predicted, eastern oak forests and surrounding
areas will be teeming with infected ticks,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Chalk it up to the robust acorn count of 1997. Many other
factors contributing to the risk of exposure to Lyme disease are
familiar: human encroachment into forests, growing deer populations
and recent warm winters that have allowed more ticks to survive.
</P>
<P>
   The new variable comes from untangling the web of relationships
that link the tick life cycle, the feeding habits of mice and deer
and the species survival instincts of oak trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it the acorn connection,'' says Ostfeld, of the
Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins deep in oak forests where every few years oak
trees undergo a process called masting, when they produce a bumper
crop of acorns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an evolved reproductive strategy,'' Ostfeld says. ``If
they dribble out a few acorns every year, there is a risk that all
the nuts will be eaten by squirrels and deer and all the other
things that eat acorns. But if the oak trees produce an enormous
bumper crop every three or four years, then some acorns will
survive and become seedlings.
</P>
<P>
   Ostfeld's analysis of this boom-and-bust cycle has led him to
conclude that two years after oak trees have their mast years, the
risk of getting Lyme disease in an oak forest goes up dramatically.
Conversely, two years after a low acorn production year, the risk
in oak forests is much lower.
</P>
<P>
   The timetable revolves around the reproductive cycles of ticks
and white-footed mice, the prime reservoirs of the Lyme bacterium.
</P>
<P>
   In a mast year, the bumper crop of acorns lures deer into the
oak forest. The deer are generally carrying a full cargo of adult
ticks. So the ticks, when done feeding, fall to the ground and lay
the eggs that will hatch into tick larvae the following summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wherever the deer are in the fall,'' Ostfeld says, ``that's
where the larval ticks will hatch the next summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, white-footed mice are also enjoying the acorn boom.
The mice, almost 100 percent of which are infected with Lyme from
previous tick encounters, spend the autumn munching acorns and
storing reserves to get them through the winter.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the tick larvae hatch that next August, the forest
is crawling with mice, Ostfeld says. ``Ticks get it from mice, mice
get it from ticks _ they pass it back and forth. Which came first,
nobody knows,'' Ostfeld says.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear, though, is that by the next June or July, two
years after the mast year, there are a lot of 1-year-old ticks, or
nymphs, in oak forests, and they stand an excellent chance of being
infected.
</P>
<P>
   That's worrisome because nymphs pose the greatest danger to
people. Nymphs feed during June and July, months when people tend
to spend time outdoors; adult ticks feed in the fall. And unlike
the adult tick, which is generally easy to spot and remove before
it transmits bacteria into the blood, the nymph tick is so tiny
(the size of a poppy seed) that it often escapes detection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1994 was a really good acorn year,'' Ostfeld says, ``we
predicted there would be lots of larvae and mice in 1995, and lots
of infected nymphs in 1996. It came true: 1996 saw a substantially
higher number of Lyme case in humans. In Connecticut, reported
cases more than doubled, rising from 1,548 in 1995 to 3,104 in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ostfeld hopes to use the acorn count each year to predict when
and where nymph ticks are likely to feed two years later, offering
people another weapon in their Lyme prevention arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main means of protecting ourselves is still going to be
not putting ourselves at risk, and the way to do that is to figure
out when the ticks are out and where they are. I envision what I
call Smokey the Tick warning people about what parks are liable to
be particularly risky for Lyme,'' Ostfeld says.
</P>
<P>
   But despite their successes, researchers admit that Lyme is far
from beaten. To maintain immunity people will probably need annual
booster shots. That may prove too demanding for those unaccustomed
to regular doctor visits.
</P>
<P>
   It's also possible, in theory, that some people with a specific
genetic makeup could develop an adverse reaction, similar to
arthritis, to the antibodies the vaccine arouses.
</P>
<P>
   Even with these concerns, researchers generally agree that the
vaccine is a major advance for people living in places where there
are lots of infected ticks.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THWARTING TICKS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because the new Lyme vaccine is not 100 percent effective, the
best defense against the disease remains a good offense. Avoid
woody, overgrown or grassy areas. And if you're hiking, stay on the
trail, tuck your pants into your socks and wear light-colored
clothing to make ticks visible.
</P>
<P>
   Spraying your pants and shoes with an insect repellent
containing DEET helps, too. Avoid spraying face and hands, because
DEET is toxic.
</P>
<P>
   Daily tick checks are a must. Nymphal ticks are tiny, and they
like moist areas, so look in spots like the groin, navel, and
behind the knees.

and recent warm winters that have allowed more ticks to survive.
</P>
<P>
   The new variable comes from untangling the web of relationships
that link the tick life cycle, the feeding habits of mice and deer
and the species survival instincts of oak trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it the acorn connection,'' says Ostfeld, of the
Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins deep in oak forests where every few years oak
trees undergo a process called masting, when they produce a bumper
crop of acorns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an evolved reproductive strategy,'' Ostfeld says. ``If
they dribble out a few acorns every year, there is a risk that all
the nuts will be eaten by squirrels and deer and all the other
things that eat acorns. But if the oak trees produce an enormous
bumper crop every three or four years, then some acorns will
survive and become seedlings.
</P>
<P>
   Ostfeld's analysis of this boom-and-bust cycle has led him to
conclude that two years after oak trees have their mast years, the
risk of getting Lyme disease in an oak forest goes up dramatically.
Conversely, two years after a low acorn production year, the risk
in oak forests is much lower.
</P>
<P>
   The timetable revolves around the reproductive cycles of ticks
and white-footed mice, the prime reservoirs of the Lyme bacterium.
</P>
<P>
   In a mast year, the bumper crop of acorns lures deer into the
oak forest. The deer are generally carrying a full cargo of adult
ticks. So the ticks, when done feeding, fall to the ground and lay
the eggs that will hatch into tick larvae the following summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wherever the deer are in the fall,'' Ostfeld says, ``that's
where the larval ticks will hatch the next summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, white-footed mice are also enjoying the acorn boom.
The mice, almost 100 percent of which are infected with Lyme from
previous tick encounters, spend the autumn munching acorns and
storing reserves to get them through the winter.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the tick larvae hatch that next August, the forest
is crawling with mice, Ostfeld says. ``Ticks get it from mice, mice
get it from ticks _ they pass it back and forth. Which came first,
nobody knows,'' Ostfeld says.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear, though, is that by the next June or July, two
years after the mast year, there are a lot of 1-year-old ticks, or
nymphs, in oak forests, and they stand an excellent chance of being
infected.
</P>
<P>
   That's worrisome because nymphs pose the greatest danger to
people. Nymphs feed during June and July, months when people tend
to spend time outdoors; adult ticks feed in the fall. And unlike
the adult tick, which is generally easy to spot and remove before
it transmits bacteria into the blood, the nymph tick is so tiny
(the size of a poppy seed) that it often escapes detection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1994 was a really good acorn year,'' Ostfeld says, ``we
predicted there would be lots of larvae and mice in 1995, and lots
of infected nymphs in 1996. It came true: 1996 saw a substantially
higher number of Lyme case in humans. In Connecticut, reported
cases more than doubled, rising from 1,548 in 1995 to 3,104 in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ostfeld hopes to use the acorn count each year to predict when
and where nymph ticks are likely to feed two years later, offering
people another weapon in their Lyme prevention arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main means of protecting ourselves is still going to be
not putting ourselves at risk, and the way to do that is to figure
out when the ticks are out and where they are. I envision what I
call Smokey the Tick warning people about what parks are liable to
be particularly risky for Lyme,'' Ostfeld says.
</P>
<P>
   But despite their successes, researchers admit that Lyme is far
from beaten. To maintain immunity people will probably need annual
booster shots. That may prove too demanding for those unaccustomed
to regular doctor visits.
</P>
<P>
   It's also possible, in theory, that some people with a specific
genetic makeup could develop an adverse reaction, similar to
arthritis, to the antibodies the vaccine arouses.
</P>
<P>
   Even with these concerns, researchers generally agree that the
vaccine is a major advance for people living in places where there
are lots of infected ticks.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THWARTING TICKS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because the new Lyme vaccine is not 100 percent effective, the
best defense against the disease remains a good offense. Avoid
woody, overgrown or grassy areas. And if you're hiking, stay on the
trail, tuck your pants into your socks and wear light-colored
clothing to make ticks visible.
</P>
<P>
   Spraying your pants and shoes with an insect repellent
containing DEET helps, too. Avoid spraying face and hands, because
DEET is toxic.
</P>
<P>
   Daily tick checks are a must. Nymphal ticks are tiny, and they
like moist areas, so look in spots like the groin, navel, and
behind the knees.

<P>
   Trolling 50 miles off Cape Cod, charterboat captain Cookie
Murray glances aft, eyeing the nylon lines trailing in the wake.
Then he turns to the depth meter to see if anything is swimming
underneath the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, at 2:45 p.m., a line on one of the baited poles at the
stern pops. Fisherman Everett Petronio leaps into the fighting
chair. This is the last day of the bluefin tuna season, and the
right bluefin could bring in tens of thousands of dollars in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The bluefin takes off and Petronio responds, cranking countless
circles with his right hand, bracing the pole with his left. The
struggle seems impossible, endless. Yet it is repeated thousands of
times a year on deep-sea fishing boats all along the United States
coasts.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing unusual is that a biologist, Molly Lutcavage, an
athletic woman in her early 40s, is on board. While Petronio fights
with his catch, Lutcavage is methodically attaching a massive dart
to the end of a hammer.
</P>
<P>
   The bluefin begins to tire, floating toward the surface. The
fish is beautiful, with opalescent skin. It is also gargantuan: 7.5
feet long and 400 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   First mate Anthony Mendillo pulls the exhausted but thrashing
fish over to the side of the hull. Second mate Delmer Bacelis
swings the hammer and _ bang! _ implants the dart behind the rear
dorsal fin of the bluefin.
</P>
<P>
   Bacelis works the hook out of the fish and everyone leaps back.
The bluefin rights and swims away. The dart it carries is a
transmitter designed to record the tuna's journey for the next six
or seven months.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the great value of bluefin, biologists know little about
them. Except that the bluefin is a remarkable swimming machine and
can hold on to its body heat even in icy North Atlantic waters.
</P>
<P>
   A bluefin can go 20 miles an hour; rushing through the sea it
can build massive amounts of muscle in a short time. With a life
expectancy of more than 30 years, the fish can grow to well over 10
feet long and reach a weight of more than 1,400 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, size and speed have proved to be little
protection. As Japan grew more affluent in the 1980s, the price for
bluefin tuna skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators tried to control the fishing frenzy that followed
with quotas, basing policies on the belief that there are two
distinct stocks of tuna: a western stock spawned in the Gulf of
Mexico, migrating along the U.S. coast and into Canadian waters,
and an eastern stock spawned in the Mediterranean Sea, migrating
along the European coast to northern waters.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 fishing for bluefin was so intense in Europe and the
Mediterranean that the quota was broken, with the catch reaching an
estimated 46,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
   If the stocks are distinct, the fortunes of one shouldn't mean
much to the other. But if that assumption is wrong, overfishing in
part of the Atlantic could threaten bluefin throughout the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   To know more, scientists developed an advanced tag to put on
bluefins. They are equipped with microprocessors and transmitters
in waterproof containers that float free from the fish. At a
programmed time, they bob to the surface and begin broadcasting
data.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage was one of the first biologists to put an advanced tag
on a bluefin. In 1993 she was hired by the New England Aquarium to
conduct an aerial survey of bluefin in the Gulf of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, there were calls to cut fishing quotas in half.
Environmentalists warned that the bluefin would soon be endangered,
while fishermen in New England claimed they saw increasing numbers
of bluefin.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage organized pilots to fly a survey off the coast of Cape
Cod. In their first year they photographed 4,984 fish in one day _
equal to about a quarter of the estimated western Atlantic stock.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, a pilot photographed a single school of
about 4,500 fish. Lutcavage's survey helped to forestall a quota
cut and to bring about a review by the National Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The academy concluded that the bluefin tuna population in the
western Atlantic had been stable since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage continued her aerial surveys until 1997. She also
tracked the fish with underwater microphones and learned that
bluefin make deep dives to the bottom at sunrise and sunset and
that after they are tagged they recover from the trauma quickly and
rejoin their schools.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1997 she began tagging tuna with light tags
weighing less than an ounce. Light tags don't slow tuna down, and
they can be built to resist the high water pressures of a deep
dive.
</P>
<P>
   But the data they transmit are limited. Once on a bluefin, the
tag starts logging the temperature once an hour. At the end of each
day the tag's computer averages the temperatures and stores the
figure. After 60 days of taking temperatures, the computer shuts
down and the tag floats free.
</P>
<P>
   The data _ when the tag surfaced, its location and the average
daily temperatures _ are transmitted to a weather satellite that
passes overhead every 102 minutes. Eventually, the data move as
e-mail to a scientist.
</P>
<P>
   The process of fully transmitting all the data collected by a
single tag takes two to three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage programmed her tags to pop up between March and July
last year, the spawning season for tuna. The data suggest that
bluefin tagged off Cape Cod move out of New England waters after a
couple of weeks, probably crossing the warm Gulf Stream into the
cooler mid-Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   By the time spawning season came, the fish were all in a region
of the mid-Atlantic bounded by Bermuda on the west and the Azores
on the east. None of the tagged fish were in primary spawning
grounds during spawning time.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Block of Stanford, working off Cape Hatteras, N.C., has
started to work with an archival tag. Lodged in a fish's abdomen,
the tag measures not just water temperature, but also light, depth
and internal temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Two years into the archival program, the evidence shows that
bluefin tend to feed in the morning and bask in the sun in the
afternoon, that they spend most of their time in the upper water
layers but also make deep dives of more than 800 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the tags show the fish going to the mid-Atlantic
and not crossing. Block believes that bluefin have the capacity to
migrate distances that could take western bluefin into eastern
waters, but it's not clear if many actually make the trip.
</P>
<P>
   But the fishing season is over and with it the tagging season.
Now comes the wait. A tag must surface, a satellite must pass by, a
signal must be sent. Out there the true story of one of the ocean's
giants remains to be told.

<P>
   PLAINVILLE, Mass. _ Some of their belongings were in storage.
Others had been dropped off with relatives. Others were packed
along with the chldren, Nicole, who was 7 at the time, and Matthew,
who was 3.
</P>
<P>
   When James Hardy pulled his car onto Route 1 that day two
summers ago, Debra Hardy didn't know what was happening.
</P>
<P>
   Their life was wrapped up in boxes. The mobile home, which they
had occupied for more than a decade and was just a short jog over
the hill from Foxboro Park, was deserted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think we'd ever be coming back,'' Debra Hardy was
saying recently, when asked about the chaos in her life in August
1997. ``All our family were here, all our friends.''
</P>
<P>
   But when you make a living training and driving horses in a
sport that has been on the endangered species list for years, you
live with uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Security is getting up in the morning, knowing that you can go
down to the stable area, tend to horses you get to know like
children, and see if they are willing to run on any given evening.
And run well enough to help you feed your children and pay your
bills.
</P>
<P>
   In the final days of Foxboro Park, security is going to work and
seeing people you have known for years in their normal places,
doing their normal routine, always wondering when the plug would be
pulled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard stories for months, all the time,'' said James Hardy,
who is now back at home, driving horses, while Debra trains them at
the work-in-progress known as Plainridge Race Course, New England's
latest and probably last attempt to make harness racing a viable
commodity in the region. ``Some days we didn't think anything was
going to happen. But you always heard the stories. We didn't know
what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Then finally it happened. Like a tornado that comes out of a
swirl of clouds, it was over. ``Just like that, too,'' said Paul
Vacca, the track superintendent at Plainridge. ``The state police
just came in and said the track was closed and everyone had to
leave immediately. The people in the money room just walked out and
left. The police had to come back and post guards until someone
could come in and finish counting the money. That's as fast as it
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   For Debra and James Hardy, it was more than a shock. It was an
upheaval. Where would they go, what would they do? James had come
out of trade school with a skill in masonry. But they were horse
people. That's all they had done together.
</P>
<P>
   Now it was in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   James looked around. What were the options? Maine? Jersey?
Upstate New York? ``We talked about it all,'' said James. ``It was
all up to the owners, Rob and Dave Silver and Tom Cummings, who
also had local ties. They stuck with us,'' said James. ``It was
tough on them. But they made the commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   So did the Hardys. The kids were taken out of school. James made
a scouting trip to Saratoga Raceway in upstate New York, which
seemed to offer the best chances. They rented an apartment, found a
school for Nicole and Matthew.
</P>
<P>
   They also kept an eye and ear on what was happening back home.
</P>
<P>
   For other drivers in the area, similiar stories were unfolding.
Some stuck with it, hoping for a revival. Others moved to different
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   The Hardys had some options. James could go back to masonry
work.
</P>
<P>
   But what about 60-year-old Robert Tisbert, still driving at
whatever track had horses to race?
</P>
<P>
   Or David Ingraham, who wanted more exposure and opportunities
than driving at Scarborough Downs in Maine offered?
</P>
<P>
   Closing a track wasn't like closing a factory.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people got hurt,'' said Hardy, trying to take the
anger out of his voice.
</P>
<P>
   With that kind of root system _ the community in the trailer
park in Foxborough was loaded with people tied to not only the
racetrack but with Foxboro Stadium, each owned by the Kraft family,
each in doubt in terms of long-range security _ any kind of rumor
of a positive nature can get legs quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, the rumors swirled up and down Route 1 and
throughout the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   A new track in Plainville, at the junction of Routes 1 and 495,
was on the drawing boards.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Piontkowski, once the head of the Massachusetts Racing
Commission and general manager at Foxboro, was trying to put a plan
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard stories and kept hoping,'' said Debra Hardy.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping and wishing.
</P>
<P>
   But racing in Massachusetts is like politics, filled with hidden
agendas, relationships, and intrigue. Nothing comes easy.
</P>
<P>
   Piontkowski needed financial backing that no one seemed to
offer. Finally Lou Giuliano, president of the New England's
Horsemen's Association, stepped up, made some deals.
</P>
<P>
   Some people didn't like the way it was done, filled with
backroom deals and questionable tactics, they said. Others saw a
bigger picture, a path to open a new racetrack in New England, to
get harness racing back to Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the plans went through, building a track seemed a leap
of faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never thought it would get off the ground,'' said James
Hardy. ``We came back in December and there was nothing but a pile
of rocks here. I never thought in a million years this place would
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardy was comfortable in Saratoga. ``Nice people, lots of
friends,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't home.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy had been through this once before, the first time Foxboro
closed, in 1986. He had to move, finding other tracks. But that was
before he had a family to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   Now he wanted more security than an apartment in Saratoga and a
nomadic existence.
</P>
<P>
   Four months after Hardy saw the ``rock pile,'' Plainridge opened
its doors for live racing. Plainridge had begun taking simulcast
betting, which has become the life support system for all but the
biggest tracks in this country, a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But live racing was what James Hardy wanted. It was what David
Ingraham, making a reputation for himself as one of the best
drivers in Maine, wanted as well.
</P>
<P>
   When Plainridge opened for racing on a track that the drivers
claim is user friendly, with gentle turns and a safer Euro track on
a five-eighths-of-a-mile course, the drivers and the trainers and
the owners came back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was three hours away,'' aid Ingraham, who makes a daily
three-hour commute from Maine and routinely drives eight to 10
times on each card. ``Any time a new track opens, it's a plus for
the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Ingraham feels it will get better before it gets worse again.
Plainridge is not a finished product, looking more like a
construction site as the finishing touches are added.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a modern track. No grandstand, and a large,
comfortable simulcast theater that offers action from noon to
midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Slot machines are also a possibility in the future, which has
led to criticism that Plainridge is masquerading as a way to get
gambling into the state, with little or no interest in live racing.
</P>
<P>
   Don't tell that to James Ingraham or James and Debra Hardy, who
ware back in their trailor in Foxborough. ``I'm confident they
didn't spend all this money to close it again,'' said James Hardy.
``It's got to better. The track is nice, the facility is good.''
</P>
<P>
   The track is still in its trial stage. Racing cards are small
and limited. The track has live racing three days a week: Monday,
Tuesday, and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Purists still say it is an operation built on a foundation of
sand _ shaky at best.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is clear, however. A new venue has risen from nothing
but faith.
</P>
<P>
   Much is at stake here. If it fails, harness racing in southern
New England will be gone _ probably forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody said we couldn't do it,'' said Vacca. ``But Lou just
pushed and pushed and pushed. It's miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   It's more than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's home,'' said James Hardy. ``This is where I'm from. This
is where I want to be.''

</P>
<P>
   A bluefin can go 20 miles an hour; rushing through the sea it
can build massive amounts of muscle in a short time. With a life
expectancy of more than 30 years, the fish can grow to well over 10
feet long and reach a weight of more than 1,400 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, size and speed have proved to be little
protection. As Japan grew more affluent in the 1980s, the price for
bluefin tuna skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators tried to control the fishing frenzy that followed
with quotas, basing policies on the belief that there are two
distinct stocks of tuna: a western stock spawned in the Gulf of
Mexico, migrating along the U.S. coast and into Canadian waters,
and an eastern stock spawned in the Mediterranean Sea, migrating
along the European coast to northern waters.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 fishing for bluefin was so intense in Europe and the
Mediterranean that the quota was broken, with the catch reaching an
estimated 46,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
   If the stocks are distinct, the fortunes of one shouldn't mean
much to the other. But if that assumption is wrong, overfishing in
part of the Atlantic could threaten bluefin throughout the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   To know more, scientists developed an advanced tag to put on
bluefins. They are equipped with microprocessors and transmitters
in waterproof containers that float free from the fish. At a
programmed time, they bob to the surface and begin broadcasting
data.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage was one of the first biologists to put an advanced tag
on a bluefin. In 1993 she was hired by the New England Aquarium to
conduct an aerial survey of bluefin in the Gulf of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, there were calls to cut fishing quotas in half.
Environmentalists warned that the bluefin would soon be endangered,
while fishermen in New England claimed they saw increasing numbers
of bluefin.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage organized pilots to fly a survey off the coast of Cape
Cod. In their first year they photographed 4,984 fish in one day _
equal to about a quarter of the estimated western Atlantic stock.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, a pilot photographed a single school of
about 4,500 fish. Lutcavage's survey helped to forestall a quota
cut and to bring about a review by the National Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The academy concluded that the bluefin tuna population in the
western Atlantic had been stable since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage continued her aerial surveys until 1997. She also
tracked the fish with underwater microphones and learned that
bluefin make deep dives to the bottom at sunrise and sunset and
that after they are tagged they recover from the trauma quickly and
rejoin their schools.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1997 she began tagging tuna with light tags
weighing less than an ounce. Light tags don't slow tuna down, and
they can be built to resist the high water pressures of a deep
dive.
</P>
<P>
   But the data they transmit are limited. Once on a bluefin, the
tag starts logging the temperature once an hour. At the end of each
day the tag's computer averages the temperatures and stores the
figure. After 60 days of taking temperatures, the computer shuts
down and the tag floats free.
</P>
<P>
   The data _ when the tag surfaced, its location and the average
daily temperatures _ are transmitted to a weather satellite that
passes overhead every 102 minutes. Eventually, the data move as
e-mail to a scientist.
</P>
<P>
   The process of fully transmitting all the data collected by a
single tag takes two to three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage programmed her tags to pop up between March and July
last year, the spawning season for tuna. The data suggest that
bluefin tagged off Cape Cod move out of New England waters after a
couple of weeks, probably crossing the warm Gulf Stream into the
cooler mid-Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   By the time spawning season came, the fish were all in a region
of the mid-Atlantic bounded by Bermuda on the west and the Azores
on the east. None of the tagged fish were in primary spawning
grounds during spawning time.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Block of Stanford, working off Cape Hatteras, N.C., has
started to work with an archival tag. Lodged in a fish's abdomen,
the tag measures not just water temperature, but also light, depth
and internal temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Two years into the archival program, the evidence shows that
bluefin tend to feed in the morning and bask in the sun in the
afternoon, that they spend most of their time in the upper water
layers but also make deep dives of more than 800 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the tags show the fish going to the mid-Atlantic
and not crossing. Block believes that bluefin have the capacity to
migrate distances that could take western bluefin into eastern
waters, but it's not clear if many actually make the trip.
</P>
<P>
   But the fishing season is over and with it the tagging season.
Now comes the wait. A tag must surface, a satellite must pass by, a
signal must be sent. Out there the true story of one of the ocean's
giants remains to be told.

   Adam Stettner racked his brains trying to figure out when it
happened. Could it have been while he was out jogging in the park?
Or when he wandered into the woods near the golf course to hunt
down a stray ball?
</P>
<P>
   Stettner never felt a bite or saw a rash. But sometime during
the summer of 1994, he was bitten by a tick infected with Borrelia
burgdorferi, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few months, the bacterium went to work, stealthily
winding its way through his bloodstream and ultimately wreaking
havoc with his nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I knew anything was wrong was in February
1995,'' Stettner says. ``I was walking down the hall at work and
suddenly the whole office started moving. It was like somebody took
my brain and put it in a blender.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next three years, Stettner submitted to test after test
_ blood chemistries, CT scans, MRIs, spinal taps, anything doctors
could think of to find the cause of his dizziness, nausea, memory
lapses and debilitating fatigue. Finally, down to 130 pounds from
160, he tested positive for Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't wish what happened to me on anybody,'' Stettner
says, a 26-year-old Wall Street trader. ``I lost a part of my life
I can never get back.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent FDA approval of a new Lyme disease vaccine has raised
hopes that stories like Stettner's may someday be relegated to
medical history books.
</P>
<P>
   This year people who live or vacation in tick-infested areas can
take a series of three Lyme immunization shots.
</P>
<P>
   But the good news is tempered by some disquieting facts. The
vaccine is approved only for adults, and it is not fully
protective. One out of five who receive the vaccine and are bitten
by infected ticks will still contract Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, vaccinated people might be tempted to let their guard
down. And this, of all years, is not a time to take chances.
</P>
<P>
   Ecologist Richard Ostfeld, who has spent the better part of the
decade figuring out the boom-and-bust cycles of the Lyme bacterium
as it circulates among ticks, mice and deer, is convinced that the
conditions for spreading the disease will he more dangerous this
summer than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   ``If things go as predicted, eastern oak forests and surrounding
areas will be teeming with infected ticks,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Chalk it up to the robust acorn count of 1997. Many other
factors contributing to the risk of exposure to Lyme disease are
familiar: human encroachment into forests, growing deer populations
and recent warm winters that have allowed more ticks to survive.
</P>
<P>
   The new variable comes from untangling the web of relationships
that link the tick life cycle, the feeding habits of mice and deer
and the species survival instincts of oak trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it the acorn connection,'' says Ostfeld, of the
Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins deep in oak forests where every few years oak
trees undergo a process called masting, when they produce a bumper
crop of acorns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an evolved reproductive strategy,'' Ostfeld says. ``If
they dribble out a few acorns every year, there is a risk that all
the nuts will be eaten by squirrels and deer and all the other
things that eat acorns. But if the oak trees produce an enormous
bumper crop every three or four years, then some acorns will
survive and become seedlings.
</P>
<P>
   Ostfeld's analysis of this boom-and-bust cycle has led him to
conclude that two years after oak trees have their mast years, the
risk of getting Lyme disease in an oak forest goes up dramatically.
Conversely, two years after a low acorn production year, the risk
in oak forests is much lower.
</P>
<P>
   The timetable revolves around the reproductive cycles of ticks
and white-footed mice, the prime reservoirs of the Lyme bacterium.
</P>
<P>
   In a mast year, the bumper crop of acorns lures deer into the
oak forest. The deer are generally carrying a full cargo of adult
ticks. So the ticks, when done feeding, fall to the ground and lay
the eggs that will hatch into tick larvae the following summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wherever the deer are in the fall,'' Ostfeld says, ``that's
where the larval ticks will hatch the next summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, white-footed mice are also enjoying the acorn boom.
The mice, almost 100 percent of which are infected with Lyme from
previous tick encounters, spend the autumn munching acorns and
storing reserves to get them through the winter.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the tick larvae hatch that next August, the forest
is crawling with mice, Ostfeld says. ``Ticks get it from mice, mice
get it from ticks _ they pass it back and forth. Which came first,
nobody knows,'' Ostfeld says.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear, though, is that by the next June or July, two
years after the mast year, there are a lot of 1-year-old ticks, or
nymphs, in oak forests, and they stand an excellent chance of being
infected.
</P>
<P>
   That's worrisome because nymphs pose the greatest danger to
people. Nymphs feed during June and July, months when people tend
to spend time outdoors; adult ticks feed in the fall. And unlike
the adult tick, which is generally easy to spot and remove before
it transmits bacteria into the blood, the nymph tick is so tiny
(the size of a poppy seed) that it often escapes detection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1994 was a really good acorn year,'' Ostfeld says, ``we
predicted there would be lots of larvae and mice in 1995, and lots
of infected nymphs in 1996. It came true: 1996 saw a substantially
higher number of Lyme case in humans. In Connecticut, reported
cases more than doubled, rising from 1,548 in 1995 to 3,104 in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ostfeld hopes to use the acorn count each year to predict when
and where nymph ticks are likely to feed two years later, offering
people another weapon in their Lyme prevention arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main means of protecting ourselves is still going to be
not putting ourselves at risk, and the way to do that is to figure
out when the ticks are out and where they are. I envision what I
call Smokey the Tick warning people about what parks are liable to
be particularly risky for Lyme,'' Ostfeld says.
</P>
<P>
   But despite their successes, researchers admit that Lyme is far
from beaten. To maintain immunity people will probably need annual
booster shots. That may prove too demanding for those unaccustomed
to regular doctor visits.
</P>
<P>
   It's also possible, in theory, that some people with a specific
genetic makeup could develop an adverse reaction, similar to
arthritis, to the antibodies the vaccine arouses.
</P>
<P>
   Even with these concerns, researchers generally agree that the
vaccine is a major advance for people living in places where there
are lots of infected ticks.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THWARTING TICKS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because the new Lyme vaccine is not 100 percent effective, the
best defense against the disease remains a good offense. Avoid
woody, overgrown or grassy areas. And if you're hiking, stay on the
trail, tuck your pants into your socks and wear light-colored
clothing to make ticks visible.
</P>
<P>
   Spraying your pants and shoes with an insect repellent
containing DEET helps, too. Avoid spraying face and hands, because
DEET is toxic.
</P>
<P>
   Daily tick checks are a must. Nymphal ticks are tiny, and they
like moist areas, so look in spots like the groin, navel, and
behind the knees.

   Trolling 50 miles off Cape Cod, charterboat captain Cookie
Murray glances aft, eyeing the nylon lines trailing in the wake.
Then he turns to the depth meter to see if anything is swimming
underneath the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, at 2:45 p.m., a line on one of the baited poles at the
stern pops. Fisherman Everett Petronio leaps into the fighting
chair. This is the last day of the bluefin tuna season, and the
right bluefin could bring in tens of thousands of dollars in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The bluefin takes off and Petronio responds, cranking countless
circles with his right hand, bracing the pole with his left. The
struggle seems impossible, endless. Yet it is repeated thousands of
times a year on deep-sea fishing boats all along the United States
coasts.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing unusual is that a biologist, Molly Lutcavage, an
athletic woman in her early 40s, is on board. While Petronio fights
with his catch, Lutcavage is methodically attaching a massive dart
to the end of a hammer.
</P>
<P>
   The bluefin begins to tire, floating toward the surface. The
fish is beautiful, with opalescent skin. It is also gargantuan: 7.5
feet long and 400 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   First mate Anthony Mendillo pulls the exhausted but thrashing
fish over to the side of the hull. Second mate Delmer Bacelis
swings the hammer and _ bang! _ implants the dart behind the rear
dorsal fin of the bluefin.
</P>
<P>
   Bacelis works the hook out of the fish and everyone leaps back.
The bluefin rights and swims away. The dart it carries is a
transmitter designed to record the tuna's journey for the next six
or seven months.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the great value of bluefin, biologists know little about
them. Except that the bluefin is a remarkable swimming machine and
can hold on to its body heat even in icy North Atlantic waters.
</P>
<P>
   A bluefin can go 20 miles an hour; rushing through the sea it
can build massive amounts of muscle in a short time. With a life
expectancy of more than 30 years, the fish can grow to well over 10
feet long and reach a weight of more than 1,400 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, size and speed have proved to be little
protection. As Japan grew more affluent in the 1980s, the price for
bluefin tuna skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators tried to control the fishing frenzy that followed
with quotas, basing policies on the belief that there are two
distinct stocks of tuna: a western stock spawned in the Gulf of
Mexico, migrating along the U.S. coast and into Canadian waters,
and an eastern stock spawned in the Mediterranean Sea, migrating
along the European coast to northern waters.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 fishing for bluefin was so intense in Europe and the
Mediterranean that the quota was broken, with the catch reaching an
estimated 46,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
   If the stocks are distinct, the fortunes of one shouldn't mean
much to the other. But if that assumption is wrong, overfishing in
part of the Atlantic could threaten bluefin throughout the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   To know more, scientists developed an advanced tag to put on
bluefins. They are equipped with microprocessors and transmitters
in waterproof containers that float free from the fish. At a
programmed time, they bob to the surface and begin broadcasting
data.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage was one of the first biologists to put an advanced tag
on a bluefin. In 1993 she was hired by the New England Aquarium to
conduct an aerial survey of bluefin in the Gulf of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, there were calls to cut fishing quotas in half.
Environmentalists warned that the bluefin would soon be endangered,
while fishermen in New England claimed they saw increasing numbers
of bluefin.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage organized pilots to fly a survey off the coast of Cape
Cod. In their first year they photographed 4,984 fish in one day _
equal to about a quarter of the estimated western Atlantic stock.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, a pilot photographed a single school of
about 4,500 fish. Lutcavage's survey helped to forestall a quota
cut and to bring about a review by the National Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The academy concluded that the bluefin tuna population in the
western Atlantic had been stable since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage continued her aerial surveys until 1997. She also
tracked the fish with underwater microphones and learned that
bluefin make deep dives to the bottom at sunrise and sunset and
that after they are tagged they recover from the trauma quickly and
rejoin their schools.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1997 she began tagging tuna with light tags
weighing less than an ounce. Light tags don't slow tuna down, and
they can be built to resist the high water pressures of a deep
dive.
</P>
<P>
   But the data they transmit are limited. Once on a bluefin, the
tag starts logging the temperature once an hour. At the end of each
day the tag's computer averages the temperatures and stores the
figure. After 60 days of taking temperatures, the computer shuts
down and the tag floats free.
</P>
<P>
   The data _ when the tag surfaced, its location and the average
daily temperatures _ are transmitted to a weather satellite that
passes overhead every 102 minutes. Eventually, the data move as
e-mail to a scientist.
</P>
<P>
   The process of fully transmitting all the data collected by a
single tag takes two to three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage programmed her tags to pop up between March and July
last year, the spawning season for tuna. The data suggest that
bluefin tagged off Cape Cod move out of New England waters after a
couple of weeks, probably crossing the warm Gulf Stream into the
cooler mid-Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   By the time spawning season came, the fish were all in a region
of the mid-Atlantic bounded by Bermuda on the west and the Azores
on the east. None of the tagged fish were in primary spawning
grounds during spawning time.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Block of Stanford, working off Cape Hatteras, N.C., has
started to work with an archival tag. Lodged in a fish's abdomen,
the tag measures not just water temperature, but also light, depth
and internal temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Two years into the archival program, the evidence shows that
bluefin tend to feed in the morning and bask in the sun in the
afternoon, that they spend most of their time in the upper water
layers but also make deep dives of more than 800 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the tags show the fish going to the mid-Atlantic
and not crossing. Block believes that bluefin have the capacity to
migrate distances that could take western bluefin into eastern
waters, but it's not clear if many actually make the trip.
</P>
<P>
   But the fishing season is over and with it the tagging season.
Now comes the wait. A tag must surface, a satellite must pass by, a
signal must be sent. Out there the true story of one of the ocean's
giants remains to be told.

   Trolling 50 miles off Cape Cod, charterboat captain Cookie
Murray glances aft, eyeing the nylon lines trailing in the wake.
Then he turns to the depth meter to see if anything is swimming
underneath the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, at 2:45 p.m., a line on one of the baited poles at the
stern pops. Fisherman Everett Petronio leaps into the fighting
chair. This is the last day of the bluefin tuna season, and the
right bluefin could bring in tens of thousands of dollars in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The bluefin takes off and Petronio responds, cranking countless
circles with his right hand, bracing the pole with his left. The
struggle seems impossible, endless. Yet it is repeated thousands of
times a year on deep-sea fishing boats all along the United States
coasts.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing unusual is that a biologist, Molly Lutcavage, an
athletic woman in her early 40s, is on board. While Petronio fights
with his catch, Lutcavage is methodically attaching a massive dart
to the end of a hammer.
</P>
<P>
   The bluefin begins to tire, floating toward the surface. The
fish is beautiful, with opalescent skin. It is also gargantuan: 7.5
feet long and 400 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   First mate Anthony Mendillo pulls the exhausted but thrashing
fish over to the side of the hull. Second mate Delmer Bacelis
swings the hammer and _ bang! _ implants the dart behind the rear
dorsal fin of the bluefin.

<P>
   Adam Stettner racked his brains trying to figure out when it
happened. Could it have been while he was out jogging in the park?
Or when he wandered into the woods near the golf course to hunt
down a stray ball?
</P>
<P>
   Stettner never felt a bite or saw a rash. But sometime during
the summer of 1994, he was bitten by a tick infected with Borrelia
burgdorferi, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few months, the bacterium went to work, stealthily
winding its way through his bloodstream and ultimately wreaking
havoc with his nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I knew anything was wrong was in February
1995,'' Stettner says. ``I was walking down the hall at work and
suddenly the whole office started moving. It was like somebody took
my brain and put it in a blender.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next three years, Stettner submitted to test after test
_ blood chemistries, CT scans, MRIs, spinal taps, anything doctors
could think of to find the cause of his dizziness, nausea, memory
lapses and debilitating fatigue. Finally, down to 130 pounds from
160, he tested positive for Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't wish what happened to me on anybody,'' Stettner
says, a 26-year-old Wall Street trader. ``I lost a part of my life
I can never get back.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent FDA approval of a new Lyme disease vaccine has raised
hopes that stories like Stettner's may someday be relegated to
medical history books.
</P>
<P>
   This year people who live or vacation in tick-infested areas can
take a series of three Lyme immunization shots.
</P>
<P>
   But the good news is tempered by some disquieting facts. The
vaccine is approved only for adults, and it is not fully
protective. One out of five who receive the vaccine and are bitten
by infected ticks will still contract Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, vaccinated people might be tempted to let their guard
down. And this, of all years, is not a time to take chances.
</P>
<P>
   Ecologist Richard Ostfeld, who has spent the better part of the
decade figuring out the boom-and-bust cycles of the Lyme bacterium
as it circulates among ticks, mice and deer, is convinced that the
conditions for spreading the disease will he more dangerous this
summer than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   ``If things go as predicted, eastern oak forests and surrounding
areas will be teeming with infected ticks,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Chalk it up to the robust acorn count of 1997. Many other
factors contributing to the risk of exposure to Lyme disease are
familiar: human encroachment into forests, growing deer populations
and recent warm winters that have allowed more ticks to survive.
</P>
<P>
   The new variable comes from untangling the web of relationships
that link the tick life cycle, the feeding habits of mice and deer
and the species survival instincts of oak trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it the acorn connection,'' says Ostfeld, of the
Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins deep in oak forests where every few years oak
trees undergo a process called masting, when they produce a bumper
crop of acorns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an evolved reproductive strategy,'' Ostfeld says. ``If
they dribble out a few acorns every year, there is a risk that all
the nuts will be eaten by squirrels and deer and all the other
things that eat acorns. But if the oak trees produce an enormous
bumper crop every three or four years, then some acorns will
survive and become seedlings.
</P>
<P>
   Ostfeld's analysis of this boom-and-bust cycle has led him to
conclude that two years after oak trees have their mast years, the
risk of getting Lyme disease in an oak forest goes up dramatically.
Conversely, two years after a low acorn production year, the risk
in oak forests is much lower.
</P>
<P>
   The timetable revolves around the reproductive cycles of ticks
and white-footed mice, the prime reservoirs of the Lyme bacterium.
</P>
<P>
   In a mast year, the bumper crop of acorns lures deer into the
oak forest. The deer are generally carrying a full cargo of adult
ticks. So the ticks, when done feeding, fall to the ground and lay
the eggs that will hatch into tick larvae the following summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wherever the deer are in the fall,'' Ostfeld says, ``that's
where the larval ticks will hatch the next summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, white-footed mice are also enjoying the acorn boom.
The mice, almost 100 percent of which are infected with Lyme from
previous tick encounters, spend the autumn munching acorns and
storing reserves to get them through the winter.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the tick larvae hatch that next August, the forest
is crawling with mice, Ostfeld says. ``Ticks get it from mice, mice
get it from ticks _ they pass it back and forth. Which came first,
nobody knows,'' Ostfeld says.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear, though, is that by the next June or July, two
years after the mast year, there are a lot of 1-year-old ticks, or
nymphs, in oak forests, and they stand an excellent chance of being
infected.
</P>
<P>
   That's worrisome because nymphs pose the greatest danger to
people. Nymphs feed during June and July, months when people tend
to spend time outdoors; adult ticks feed in the fall. And unlike
the adult tick, which is generally easy to spot and remove before
it transmits bacteria into the blood, the nymph tick is so tiny
(the size of a poppy seed) that it often escapes detection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1994 was a really good acorn year,'' Ostfeld says, ``we
predicted there would be lots of larvae and mice in 1995, and lots
of infected nymphs in 1996. It came true: 1996 saw a substantially
higher number of Lyme case in humans. In Connecticut, reported
cases more than doubled, rising from 1,548 in 1995 to 3,104 in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ostfeld hopes to use the acorn count each year to predict when
and where nymph ticks are likely to feed two years later, offering
people another weapon in their Lyme prevention arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main means of protecting ourselves is still going to be
not putting ourselves at risk, and the way to do that is to figure
out when the ticks are out and where they are. I envision what I
call Smokey the Tick warning people about what parks are liable to
be particularly risky for Lyme,'' Ostfeld says.
</P>
<P>
   But despite their successes, researchers admit that Lyme is far
from beaten. To maintain immunity people will probably need annual
booster shots. That may prove too demanding for those unaccustomed
to regular doctor visits.
</P>
<P>
   It's also possible, in theory, that some people with a specific
genetic makeup could develop an adverse reaction, similar to
arthritis, to the antibodies the vaccine arouses.
</P>
<P>
   Even with these concerns, researchers generally agree that the
vaccine is a major advance for people living in places where there
are lots of infected ticks.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THWARTING TICKS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because the new Lyme vaccine is not 100 percent effective, the
best defense against the disease remains a good offense. Avoid
woody, overgrown or grassy areas. And if you're hiking, stay on the
trail, tuck your pants into your socks and wear light-colored
clothing to make ticks visible.
</P>
<P>
   Spraying your pants and shoes with an insect repellent
containing DEET helps, too. Avoid spraying face and hands, because
DEET is toxic.
</P>
<P>
   Daily tick checks are a must. Nymphal ticks are tiny, and they
like moist areas, so look in spots like the groin, navel, and
behind the knees.

   This year people who live or vacation in tick-infested areas can
take a series of three Lyme immunization shots.
</P>
<P>
   But the good news is tempered by some disquieting facts. The
vaccine is approved only for adults, and it is not fully
protective. One out of five who receive the vaccine and are bitten
by infected ticks will still contract Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, vaccinated people might be tempted to let their guard
down. And this, of all years, is not a time to take chances.
</P>
<P>
   Ecologist Richard Ostfeld, who has spent the better part of the
decade figuring out the boom-and-bust cycles of the Lyme bacterium
as it circulates among ticks, mice and deer, is convinced that the
conditions for spreading the disease will he more dangerous this
summer than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   ``If things go as predicted, eastern oak forests and surrounding
areas will be teeming with infected ticks,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Chalk it up to the robust acorn count of 1997. Many other
factors contributing to the risk of exposure to Lyme disease are
familiar: human encroachment into forests, growing deer populations
and recent warm winters that have allowed more ticks to survive.
</P>
<P>
   The new variable comes from untangling the web of relationships
that link the tick life cycle, the feeding habits of mice and deer
and the species survival instincts of oak trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it the acorn connection,'' says Ostfeld, of the
Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins deep in oak forests where every few years oak
trees undergo a process called masting, when they produce a bumper
crop of acorns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an evolved reproductive strategy,'' Ostfeld says. ``If
they dribble out a few acorns every year, there is a risk that all
the nuts will be eaten by squirrels and deer and all the other
things that eat acorns. But if the oak trees produce an enormous
bumper crop every three or four years, then some acorns will
survive and become seedlings.
</P>
<P>
   Ostfeld's analysis of this boom-and-bust cycle has led him to
conclude that two years after oak trees have their mast years, the
risk of getting Lyme disease in an oak forest goes up dramatically.
Conversely, two years after a low acorn production year, the risk
in oak forests is much lower.
</P>
<P>
   The timetable revolves around the reproductive cycles of ticks
and white-footed mice, the prime reservoirs of the Lyme bacterium.
</P>
<P>
   In a mast year, the bumper crop of acorns lures deer into the
oak forest. The deer are generally carrying a full cargo of adult
ticks. So the ticks, when done feeding, fall to the ground and lay
the eggs that will hatch into tick larvae the following summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wherever the deer are in the fall,'' Ostfeld says, ``that's
where the larval ticks will hatch the next summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, white-footed mice are also enjoying the acorn boom.
The mice, almost 100 percent of which are infected with Lyme from
previous tick encounters, spend the autumn munching acorns and
storing reserves to get them through the winter.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the tick larvae hatch that next August, the forest
is crawling with mice, Ostfeld says. ``Ticks get it from mice, mice
get it from ticks _ they pass it back and forth. Which came first,
nobody knows,'' Ostfeld says.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear, though, is that by the next June or July, two
years after the mast year, there are a lot of 1-year-old ticks, or
nymphs, in oak forests, and they stand an excellent chance of being
infected.
</P>
<P>
   That's worrisome because nymphs pose the greatest danger to
people. Nymphs feed during June and July, months when people tend
to spend time outdoors; adult ticks feed in the fall. And unlike
the adult tick, which is generally easy to spot and remove before
it transmits bacteria into the blood, the nymph tick is so tiny
(the size of a poppy seed) that it often escapes detection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1994 was a really good acorn year,'' Ostfeld says, ``we
predicted there would be lots of larvae and mice in 1995, and lots
of infected nymphs in 1996. It came true: 1996 saw a substantially
higher number of Lyme case in humans. In Connecticut, reported
cases more than doubled, rising from 1,548 in 1995 to 3,104 in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ostfeld hopes to use the acorn count each year to predict when
and where nymph ticks are likely to feed two years later, offering
people another weapon in their Lyme prevention arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main means of protecting ourselves is still going to be
not putting ourselves at risk, and the way to do that is to figure
out when the ticks are out and where they are. I envision what I
call Smokey the Tick warning people about what parks are liable to
be particularly risky for Lyme,'' Ostfeld says.
</P>
<P>
   But despite their successes, researchers admit that Lyme is far
from beaten. To maintain immunity people will probably need annual
booster shots. That may prove too demanding for those unaccustomed
to regular doctor visits.
</P>
<P>
   It's also possible, in theory, that some people with a specific
genetic makeup could develop an adverse reaction, similar to
arthritis, to the antibodies the vaccine arouses.
</P>
<P>
   Even with these concerns, researchers generally agree that the
vaccine is a major advance for people living in places where there
are lots of infected ticks.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THWARTING TICKS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because the new Lyme vaccine is not 100 percent effective, the
best defense against the disease remains a good offense. Avoid
woody, overgrown or grassy areas. And if you're hiking, stay on the
trail, tuck your pants into your socks and wear light-colored
clothing to make ticks visible.
</P>
<P>
   Spraying your pants and shoes with an insect repellent
containing DEET helps, too. Avoid spraying face and hands, because
DEET is toxic.
</P>
<P>
   Daily tick checks are a must. Nymphal ticks are tiny, and they
like moist areas, so look in spots like the groin, navel, and
behind the knees.

<P>
   Trolling 50 miles off Cape Cod, charterboat captain Cookie
Murray glances aft, eyeing the nylon lines trailing in the wake.
Then he turns to the depth meter to see if anything is swimming
underneath the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, at 2:45 p.m., a line on one of the baited poles at the
stern pops. Fisherman Everett Petronio leaps into the fighting
chair. This is the last day of the bluefin tuna season, and the
right bluefin could bring in tens of thousands of dollars in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The bluefin takes off and Petronio responds, cranking countless
circles with his right hand, bracing the pole with his left. The
struggle seems impossible, endless. Yet it is repeated thousands of
times a year on deep-sea fishing boats all along the United States
coasts.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing unusual is that a biologist, Molly Lutcavage, an
athletic woman in her early 40s, is on board. While Petronio fights
with his catch, Lutcavage is methodically attaching a massive dart
to the end of a hammer.
</P>
<P>
   The bluefin begins to tire, floating toward the surface. The
fish is beautiful, with opalescent skin. It is also gargantuan: 7.5
feet long and 400 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   First mate Anthony Mendillo pulls the exhausted but thrashing
fish over to the side of the hull. Second mate Delmer Bacelis
swings the hammer and _ bang! _ implants the dart behind the rear
dorsal fin of the bluefin.
</P>
<P>
   Bacelis works the hook out of the fish and everyone leaps back.
The bluefin rights and swims away. The dart it carries is a
transmitter designed to record the tuna's journey for the next six
or seven months.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the great value of bluefin, biologists know little about
them. Except that the bluefin is a remarkable swimming machine and
can hold on to its body heat even in icy North Atlantic waters.
</P>
<P>
   A bluefin can go 20 miles an hour; rushing through the sea it
can build massive amounts of muscle in a short time. With a life
expectancy of more than 30 years, the fish can grow to well over 10
feet long and reach a weight of more than 1,400 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, size and speed have proved to be little
protection. As Japan grew more affluent in the 1980s, the price for
bluefin tuna skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators tried to control the fishing frenzy that followed
with quotas, basing policies on the belief that there are two
distinct stocks of tuna: a western stock spawned in the Gulf of
Mexico, migrating along the U.S. coast and into Canadian waters,
and an eastern stock spawned in the Mediterranean Sea, migrating
along the European coast to northern waters.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 fishing for bluefin was so intense in Europe and the
Mediterranean that the quota was broken, with the catch reaching an
estimated 46,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
   If the stocks are distinct, the fortunes of one shouldn't mean
much to the other. But if that assumption is wrong, overfishing in
part of the Atlantic could threaten bluefin throughout the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   To know more, scientists developed an advanced tag to put on
bluefins. They are equipped with microprocessors and transmitters
in waterproof containers that float free from the fish. At a
programmed time, they bob to the surface and begin broadcasting
data.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage was one of the first biologists to put an advanced tag
on a bluefin. In 1993 she was hired by the New England Aquarium to
conduct an aerial survey of bluefin in the Gulf of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, there were calls to cut fishing quotas in half.
Environmentalists warned that the bluefin would soon be endangered,
while fishermen in New England claimed they saw increasing numbers
of bluefin.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage organized pilots to fly a survey off the coast of Cape
Cod. In their first year they photographed 4,984 fish in one day _
equal to about a quarter of the estimated western Atlantic stock.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, a pilot photographed a single school of
about 4,500 fish. Lutcavage's survey helped to forestall a quota
cut and to bring about a review by the National Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The academy concluded that the bluefin tuna population in the
western Atlantic had been stable since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage continued her aerial surveys until 1997. She also
tracked the fish with underwater microphones and learned that
bluefin make deep dives to the bottom at sunrise and sunset and
that after they are tagged they recover from the trauma quickly and
rejoin their schools.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1997 she began tagging tuna with light tags
weighing less than an ounce. Light tags don't slow tuna down, and
they can be built to resist the high water pressures of a deep
dive.
</P>
<P>
   But the data they transmit are limited. Once on a bluefin, the
tag starts logging the temperature once an hour. At the end of each
day the tag's computer averages the temperatures and stores the
figure. After 60 days of taking temperatures, the computer shuts
down and the tag floats free.
</P>
<P>
   The data _ when the tag surfaced, its location and the average
daily temperatures _ are transmitted to a weather satellite that
passes overhead every 102 minutes. Eventually, the data move as
e-mail to a scientist.
</P>
<P>
   The process of fully transmitting all the data collected by a
single tag takes two to three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage programmed her tags to pop up between March and July
last year, the spawning season for tuna. The data suggest that
bluefin tagged off Cape Cod move out of New England waters after a
couple of weeks, probably crossing the warm Gulf Stream into the
cooler mid-Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   By the time spawning season came, the fish were all in a region
of the mid-Atlantic bounded by Bermuda on the west and the Azores
on the east. None of the tagged fish were in primary spawning
grounds during spawning time.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Block of Stanford, working off Cape Hatteras, N.C., has
started to work with an archival tag. Lodged in a fish's abdomen,
the tag measures not just water temperature, but also light, depth
and internal temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Two years into the archival program, the evidence shows that
bluefin tend to feed in the morning and bask in the sun in the
afternoon, that they spend most of their time in the upper water
layers but also make deep dives of more than 800 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the tags show the fish going to the mid-Atlantic
and not crossing. Block believes that bluefin have the capacity to
migrate distances that could take western bluefin into eastern
waters, but it's not clear if many actually make the trip.
</P>
<P>
   But the fishing season is over and with it the tagging season.
Now comes the wait. A tag must surface, a satellite must pass by, a
signal must be sent. Out there the true story of one of the ocean's
giants remains to be told.

REUNIONS AND CASINOS ARE POPULAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have you made your summer vacation plans?
</P>
<P>
   If not, here's a look at what the Travel Industry Association
and AAA predicts you may be doing and spending.
</P>
<P>
   Americans, the TIA/AAA forecast says, are more likely to go to a
family reunion or a casino this year than last. While going to the
beach or lake still tops the list for favorite summer activities,
29 percent of those surveyed said a family reunion was in the
plans, up from 25 percent last year, and 24 percent said they would
be heading to a casino, up from 19 percent last year. Dropping in
interest this summer were fishing vacations (39 percent) and
cultural event attendance (37 percent); both are down about 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, while economic reports show Americans are
spending more on many items, the vacation survey said value was on
the minds of travelers. Those surveyed said they may be planning a
slightly longer vacation this year, but they also were planning on
spending less.
</P>
<P>
   TIA also surveyed travelers on what they plan to do on a trip of
100 miles or more. The most popular activities were: dining, 48
percent; shopping, 45 percent; museum going, 26 percent;
sightseeing tours, 24 percent; going to the movies, 16 percent, and
visiting a theme park, 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Getting value for the dollar is key to most travelers today.
Bermuda is showing a renewed focus on tourism with the introduction
of value-added packages. While long regarded as tourist friendly
and easy to reach (about two hours flying time), the island was
considered by many vacationers to be more costly than other
destinations.
</P>
<P>
   But when one adds up all the island amenities and the
value-added deals on island properties, Bermuda sounds good as a
vacation destination. Here are some sample four- day/three-night
packages:
</P>
<P>
   At the Elbow Beach the package includes accommodations, a
welcome cocktail, a snorkeling trip, an organized nature walk, and
use of the putting green. Prices begin at $823 a room through Oct.
32 (phone 800-223-7434).
</P>
<P>
   The Sonesta Beach Resort Bermuda (800-SONESTA) offers a Golf
Escape that includes accommodations for two, use of the resort's
European spa, two rounds of golf at the Port Royal championship
golf course including golf balls, a cart, course transfers, and
taxes and gratuities. Rates begin at $1,425 a room through Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   The Southampton Princess (800-441-1414) has a Royal Dolphin
Encounter with a swim-with-dolphins activitiy, accommodations, a
T-shirt, daytime tennis, taxes and gratuities. The package begins
at $648 a person through Sept. 6. Children 5-12 can participate for
an additional $63 a stay.
</P>
<P>
   Bermuda offers a variety of accommodations from guest houses and
family-run inns to luxury resorts. For island information, call
800-BERMUDA or, on the Web, visit www.bermudatourism.com.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Music festival
</P>
<P>
   A world-class music festival with a bird's eye view of Montreal,
the Montreal Chamber Music Festival will be held June 3-13. Most
concerts will be atop Mount Royal in the Chalet de la Montaagne.
For concert information, call 514-489-7444. For tickets, call
514-842-2112 (Prices are about $22 US for adults, $20 for seniors,

   The process of fully transmitting all the data collected by a
single tag takes two to three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage programmed her tags to pop up between March and July
last year, the spawning season for tuna. The data suggest that
bluefin tagged off Cape Cod move out of New England waters after a
couple of weeks, probably crossing the warm Gulf Stream into the
cooler mid-Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   By the time spawning season came, the fish were all in a region
of the mid-Atlantic bounded by Bermuda on the west and the Azores
on the east. None of the tagged fish were in primary spawning
grounds during spawning time.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Block of Stanford, working off Cape Hatteras, N.C., has
started to work with an archival tag. Lodged in a fish's abdomen,
the tag measures not just water temperature, but also light, depth
and internal temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Two years into the archival program, the evidence shows that
bluefin tend to feed in the morning and bask in the sun in the
afternoon, that they spend most of their time in the upper water
layers but also make deep dives of more than 800 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the tags show the fish going to the mid-Atlantic
and not crossing. Block believes that bluefin have the capacity to
migrate distances that could take western bluefin into eastern
waters, but it's not clear if many actually make the trip.
</P>
<P>
   But the fishing season is over and with it the tagging season.
Now comes the wait. A tag must surface, a satellite must pass by, a
signal must be sent. Out there the true story of one of the ocean's
giants remains to be told.

   Adam Stettner racked his brains trying to figure out when it
happened. Could it have been while he was out jogging in the park?
Or when he wandered into the woods near the golf course to hunt
down a stray ball?
</P>
<P>
   Stettner never felt a bite or saw a rash. But sometime during
the summer of 1994, he was bitten by a tick infected with Borrelia
burgdorferi, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few months, the bacterium went to work, stealthily
winding its way through his bloodstream and ultimately wreaking
havoc with his nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I knew anything was wrong was in February
1995,'' Stettner says. ``I was walking down the hall at work and
suddenly the whole office started moving. It was like somebody took
my brain and put it in a blender.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next three years, Stettner submitted to test after test
_ blood chemistries, CT scans, MRIs, spinal taps, anything doctors
could think of to find the cause of his dizziness, nausea, memory
lapses and debilitating fatigue. Finally, down to 130 pounds from
160, he tested positive for Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't wish what happened to me on anybody,'' Stettner
says, a 26-year-old Wall Street trader. ``I lost a part of my life
I can never get back.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent FDA approval of a new Lyme disease vaccine has raised
hopes that stories like Stettner's may someday be relegated to
medical history books.
</P>
<P>
   This year people who live or vacation in tick-infested areas can
take a series of three Lyme immunization shots.
</P>
<P>
   But the good news is tempered by some disquieting facts. The
vaccine is approved only for adults, and it is not fully
protective. One out of five who receive the vaccine and are bitten
by infected ticks will still contract Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, vaccinated people might be tempted to let their guard
down. And this, of all years, is not a time to take chances.
</P>
<P>
   Ecologist Richard Ostfeld, who has spent the better part of the
decade figuring out the boom-and-bust cycles of the Lyme bacterium
as it circulates among ticks, mice and deer, is convinced that the
conditions for spreading the disease will he more dangerous this
summer than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   ``If things go as predicted, eastern oak forests and surrounding
areas will be teeming with infected ticks,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Chalk it up to the robust acorn count of 1997. Many other
factors contributing to the risk of exposure to Lyme disease are
familiar: human encroachment into forests, growing deer populations
and recent warm winters that have allowed more ticks to survive.
</P>
<P>
   The new variable comes from untangling the web of relationships
that link the tick life cycle, the feeding habits of mice and deer
and the species survival instincts of oak trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it the acorn connection,'' says Ostfeld, of the
Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins deep in oak forests where every few years oak
trees undergo a process called masting, when they produce a bumper
crop of acorns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an evolved reproductive strategy,'' Ostfeld says. ``If
they dribble out a few acorns every year, there is a risk that all
the nuts will be eaten by squirrels and deer and all the other
things that eat acorns. But if the oak trees produce an enormous
bumper crop every three or four years, then some acorns will
survive and become seedlings.
</P>
<P>
   Ostfeld's analysis of this boom-and-bust cycle has led him to
conclude that two years after oak trees have their mast years, the
risk of getting Lyme disease in an oak forest goes up dramatically.
Conversely, two years after a low acorn production year, the risk
in oak forests is much lower.
</P>
<P>
   The timetable revolves around the reproductive cycles of ticks
and white-footed mice, the prime reservoirs of the Lyme bacterium.
</P>
<P>
   In a mast year, the bumper crop of acorns lures deer into the
oak forest. The deer are generally carrying a full cargo of adult
ticks. So the ticks, when done feeding, fall to the ground and lay
the eggs that will hatch into tick larvae the following summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wherever the deer are in the fall,'' Ostfeld says, ``that's
where the larval ticks will hatch the next summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, white-footed mice are also enjoying the acorn boom.
The mice, almost 100 percent of which are infected with Lyme from
previous tick encounters, spend the autumn munching acorns and
storing reserves to get them through the winter.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the tick larvae hatch that next August, the forest
is crawling with mice, Ostfeld says. ``Ticks get it from mice, mice
get it from ticks _ they pass it back and forth. Which came first,
nobody knows,'' Ostfeld says.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear, though, is that by the next June or July, two
years after the mast year, there are a lot of 1-year-old ticks, or
nymphs, in oak forests, and they stand an excellent chance of being
infected.
</P>
<P>
   That's worrisome because nymphs pose the greatest danger to
people. Nymphs feed during June and July, months when people tend
to spend time outdoors; adult ticks feed in the fall. And unlike
the adult tick, which is generally easy to spot and remove before
it transmits bacteria into the blood, the nymph tick is so tiny
(the size of a poppy seed) that it often escapes detection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1994 was a really good acorn year,'' Ostfeld says, ``we
predicted there would be lots of larvae and mice in 1995, and lots
of infected nymphs in 1996. It came true: 1996 saw a substantially
higher number of Lyme case in humans. In Connecticut, reported
cases more than doubled, rising from 1,548 in 1995 to 3,104 in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ostfeld hopes to use the acorn count each year to predict when
and where nymph ticks are likely to feed two years later, offering
people another weapon in their Lyme prevention arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main means of protecting ourselves is still going to be
not putting ourselves at risk, and the way to do that is to figure
out when the ticks are out and where they are. I envision what I
call Smokey the Tick warning people about what parks are liable to
be particularly risky for Lyme,'' Ostfeld says.
</P>
<P>
   But despite their successes, researchers admit that Lyme is far
from beaten. To maintain immunity people will probably need annual
booster shots. That may prove too demanding for those unaccustomed
to regular doctor visits.
</P>
<P>
   It's also possible, in theory, that some people with a specific
genetic makeup could develop an adverse reaction, similar to
arthritis, to the antibodies the vaccine arouses.
</P>
<P>
   Even with these concerns, researchers generally agree that the
vaccine is a major advance for people living in places where there
are lots of infected ticks.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THWARTING TICKS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because the new Lyme vaccine is not 100 percent effective, the
best defense against the disease remains a good offense. Avoid
woody, overgrown or grassy areas. And if you're hiking, stay on the
trail, tuck your pants into your socks and wear light-colored
clothing to make ticks visible.
</P>
<P>
   Spraying your pants and shoes with an insect repellent
containing DEET helps, too. Avoid spraying face and hands, because
DEET is toxic.
</P>
<P>
   Daily tick checks are a must. Nymphal ticks are tiny, and they
like moist areas, so look in spots like the groin, navel, and
behind the knees.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Trolling 50 miles off Cape Cod, charterboat captain Cookie
Murray glances aft, eyeing the nylon lines trailing in the wake.
Then he turns to the depth meter to see if anything is swimming
underneath the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, at 2:45 p.m., a line on one of the baited poles at the
stern pops. Fisherman Everett Petronio leaps into the fighting
chair. This is the last day of the bluefin tuna season, and the
right bluefin could bring in tens of thousands of dollars in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The bluefin takes off and Petronio responds, cranking countless
circles with his right hand, bracing the pole with his left. The
struggle seems impossible, endless. Yet it is repeated thousands of
times a year on deep-sea fishing boats all along the United States
coasts.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing unusual is that a biologist, Molly Lutcavage, an
athletic woman in her early 40s, is on board. While Petronio fights
with his catch, Lutcavage is methodically attaching a massive dart
to the end of a hammer.
</P>
<P>
   The bluefin begins to tire, floating toward the surface. The
fish is beautiful, with opalescent skin. It is also gargantuan: 7.5
feet long and 400 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   First mate Anthony Mendillo pulls the exhausted but thrashing
fish over to the side of the hull. Second mate Delmer Bacelis
swings the hammer and _ bang! _ implants the dart behind the rear
dorsal fin of the bluefin.
</P>
<P>
   Bacelis works the hook out of the fish and everyone leaps back.
The bluefin rights and swims away. The dart it carries is a
transmitter designed to record the tuna's journey for the next six
or seven months.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the great value of bluefin, biologists know little about
them. Except that the bluefin is a remarkable swimming machine and
can hold on to its body heat even in icy North Atlantic waters.
</P>
<P>
   A bluefin can go 20 miles an hour; rushing through the sea it
can build massive amounts of muscle in a short time. With a life
expectancy of more than 30 years, the fish can grow to well over 10
feet long and reach a weight of more than 1,400 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, size and speed have proved to be little
protection. As Japan grew more affluent in the 1980s, the price for
bluefin tuna skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators tried to control the fishing frenzy that followed
with quotas, basing policies on the belief that there are two
distinct stocks of tuna: a western stock spawned in the Gulf of
Mexico, migrating along the U.S. coast and into Canadian waters,
and an eastern stock spawned in the Mediterranean Sea, migrating
along the European coast to northern waters.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 fishing for bluefin was so intense in Europe and the
Mediterranean that the quota was broken, with the catch reaching an
estimated 46,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
   If the stocks are distinct, the fortunes of one shouldn't mean
much to the other. But if that assumption is wrong, overfishing in
part of the Atlantic could threaten bluefin throughout the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   To know more, scientists developed an advanced tag to put on
bluefins. They are equipped with microprocessors and transmitters
in waterproof containers that float free from the fish. At a
programmed time, they bob to the surface and begin broadcasting
data.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage was one of the first biologists to put an advanced tag
on a bluefin. In 1993 she was hired by the New England Aquarium to
conduct an aerial survey of bluefin in the Gulf of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, there were calls to cut fishing quotas in half.
Environmentalists warned that the bluefin would soon be endangered,
while fishermen in New England claimed they saw increasing numbers
of bluefin.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage organized pilots to fly a survey off the coast of Cape
Cod. In their first year they photographed 4,984 fish in one day _
equal to about a quarter of the estimated western Atlantic stock.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, a pilot photographed a single school of
about 4,500 fish. Lutcavage's survey helped to forestall a quota
cut and to bring about a review by the National Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The academy concluded that the bluefin tuna population in the
western Atlantic had been stable since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage continued her aerial surveys until 1997. She also
tracked the fish with underwater microphones and learned that
bluefin make deep dives to the bottom at sunrise and sunset and
that after they are tagged they recover from the trauma quickly and
rejoin their schools.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1997 she began tagging tuna with light tags
weighing less than an ounce. Light tags don't slow tuna down, and
they can be built to resist the high water pressures of a deep
dive.
</P>
<P>
   But the data they transmit are limited. Once on a bluefin, the
tag starts logging the temperature once an hour. At the end of each
day the tag's computer averages the temperatures and stores the
figure. After 60 days of taking temperatures, the computer shuts
down and the tag floats free.
</P>
<P>
   The data _ when the tag surfaced, its location and the average
daily temperatures _ are transmitted to a weather satellite that
passes overhead every 102 minutes. Eventually, the data move as
e-mail to a scientist.
</P>
<P>
   The process of fully transmitting all the data collected by a
single tag takes two to three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage programmed her tags to pop up between March and July
last year, the spawning season for tuna. The data suggest that
bluefin tagged off Cape Cod move out of New England waters after a
couple of weeks, probably crossing the warm Gulf Stream into the
cooler mid-Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   By the time spawning season came, the fish were all in a region
of the mid-Atlantic bounded by Bermuda on the west and the Azores
on the east. None of the tagged fish were in primary spawning
grounds during spawning time.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Block of Stanford, working off Cape Hatteras, N.C., has
started to work with an archival tag. Lodged in a fish's abdomen,
the tag measures not just water temperature, but also light, depth
and internal temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Two years into the archival program, the evidence shows that
bluefin tend to feed in the morning and bask in the sun in the
afternoon, that they spend most of their time in the upper water
layers but also make deep dives of more than 800 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the tags show the fish going to the mid-Atlantic
and not crossing. Block believes that bluefin have the capacity to
migrate distances that could take western bluefin into eastern
waters, but it's not clear if many actually make the trip.
</P>
<P>
   But the fishing season is over and with it the tagging season.
Now comes the wait. A tag must surface, a satellite must pass by, a
signal must be sent. Out there the true story of one of the ocean's
giants remains to be told.

<P>
   Trolling 50 miles off Cape Cod, charterboat captain Cookie
Murray glances aft, eyeing the nylon lines trailing in the wake.
Then he turns to the depth meter to see if anything is swimming
underneath the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, at 2:45 p.m., a line on one of the baited poles at the
stern pops. Fisherman Everett Petronio leaps into the fighting
chair. This is the last day of the bluefin tuna season, and the
right bluefin could bring in tens of thousands of dollars in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The bluefin takes off and Petronio responds, cranking countless
circles with his right hand, bracing the pole with his left. The
struggle seems impossible, endless. Yet it is repeated thousands of
times a year on deep-sea fishing boats all along the United States
coasts.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing unusual is that a biologist, Molly Lutcavage, an
athletic woman in her early 40s, is on board. While Petronio fights
with his catch, Lutcavage is methodically attaching a massive dart
to the end of a hammer.
</P>
<P>
   The bluefin begins to tire, floating toward the surface. The
fish is beautiful, with opalescent skin. It is also gargantuan: 7.5
feet long and 400 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   First mate Anthony Mendillo pulls the exhausted but thrashing
fish over to the side of the hull. Second mate Delmer Bacelis
swings the hammer and _ bang! _ implants the dart behind the rear
dorsal fin of the bluefin.
</P>
<P>
   Bacelis works the hook out of the fish and everyone leaps back.
The bluefin rights and swims away. The dart it carries is a
transmitter designed to record the tuna's journey for the next six
or seven months.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the great value of bluefin, biologists know little about
them. Except that the bluefin is a remarkable swimming machine and
can hold on to its body heat even in icy North Atlantic waters.
</P>
<P>
   A bluefin can go 20 miles an hour; rushing through the sea it
can build massive amounts of muscle in a short time. With a life
expectancy of more than 30 years, the fish can grow to well over 10
feet long and reach a weight of more than 1,400 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, size and speed have proved to be little
protection. As Japan grew more affluent in the 1980s, the price for
bluefin tuna skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators tried to control the fishing frenzy that followed
with quotas, basing policies on the belief that there are two
distinct stocks of tuna: a western stock spawned in the Gulf of
Mexico, migrating along the U.S. coast and into Canadian waters,
and an eastern stock spawned in the Mediterranean Sea, migrating
along the European coast to northern waters.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 fishing for bluefin was so intense in Europe and the
Mediterranean that the quota was broken, with the catch reaching an
estimated 46,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
   If the stocks are distinct, the fortunes of one shouldn't mean
much to the other. But if that assumption is wrong, overfishing in
part of the Atlantic could threaten bluefin throughout the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   To know more, scientists developed an advanced tag to put on
bluefins. They are equipped with microprocessors and transmitters
in waterproof containers that float free from the fish. At a
programmed time, they bob to the surface and begin broadcasting
data.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage was one of the first biologists to put an advanced tag
on a bluefin. In 1993 she was hired by the New England Aquarium to
conduct an aerial survey of bluefin in the Gulf of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, there were calls to cut fishing quotas in half.
Environmentalists warned that the bluefin would soon be endangered,
while fishermen in New England claimed they saw increasing numbers
of bluefin.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage organized pilots to fly a survey off the coast of Cape
Cod. In their first year they photographed 4,984 fish in one day _
equal to about a quarter of the estimated western Atlantic stock.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, a pilot photographed a single school of
about 4,500 fish. Lutcavage's survey helped to forestall a quota
cut and to bring about a review by the National Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The academy concluded that the bluefin tuna population in the
western Atlantic had been stable since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage continued her aerial surveys until 1997. She also
tracked the fish with underwater microphones and learned that
bluefin make deep dives to the bottom at sunrise and sunset and
that after they are tagged they recover from the trauma quickly and
rejoin their schools.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1997 she began tagging tuna with light tags
weighing less than an ounce. Light tags don't slow tuna down, and
they can be built to resist the high water pressures of a deep
dive.
</P>
<P>
   But the data they transmit are limited. Once on a bluefin, the
tag starts logging the temperature once an hour. At the end of each
day the tag's computer averages the temperatures and stores the
figure. After 60 days of taking temperatures, the computer shuts
down and the tag floats free.
</P>
<P>
   The data _ when the tag surfaced, its location and the average
daily temperatures _ are transmitted to a weather satellite that
passes overhead every 102 minutes. Eventually, the data move as
e-mail to a scientist.
</P>

FAB FACTS ABOUT A FABLED CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   San Francisco has been called America's favorite city, although
a few Bostonians might quibble. One thing is certain, though: The
City by the Bay is a trove of fascinating facts. A lot of them can
be found in an entertaining little book that's shaped like the
Golden Gate Bridge: ``San Francisco Secrets'' by John Snyder
(Chronicle Books, $7.95). Let's reveal just a few of those
``secrets'':
</P>
<P>
   --The south stairway of Alta Plaza Park replicates the grand
stairway of the casino at Monte Carlo.
</P>
<P>
   --Robert Stroud, the Birdman of Alcatraz, never kept birds at
that famous prison.
</P>
<P>
   --Much of the money for the construction of the largest Buddhist
temple in the United States, Buddha's Universal Temple, was raised
from fortune cookie sales.
</P>
<P>
   --As a courtesy to guests, the St. Francis Hotel has washed and
polished its coins daily since 1939.
</P>
<P>
   --Vermont Street, and not Lombard Street, is the city's
crookedest street.
</P>
<P>
   --Dislike of the name ``Frisco'' goes back a long, long time. In
1907, an Anti-Frisco Committee was formed.
</P>
<P>
   --A woman sued the city for $500,000, claiming that a cable car
accident turned her into a nymphomaniac. She was awarded $50,000. &QL; 
 &QL; 
And speaking of San Francisco: The name Ghirardelli conjures up
heavenly visions of chocolate, but Ghirardelli Square offers even
more: shops, restaurants, and entertainment. For a coupon
redeemable in the square for a discount booklet, shopping bag, and
chocolate treat, visit www.ghirardellisq.com. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Travel Trivia: You're flying at 35,000 feet. The air temperature
outside your plane is (a) 450 degrees below zero, (b) 45 degrees
below, (c) 45 degrees above, or (d) 450 degrees above. (Answer at
end of column.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
In a name: Seeing the name ``Irish Permanent,'' some first-time
visitors to Ireland assume the sign indicates a widespread chain of
hair salons. Actually, Irish Permanent is one of the largest
financial services companies in the Republic of Ireland. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quotable: He who never leaves his country is full of prejudices.''
_ Carlo Goldoni (1707-1793). &QL; 
 &QL; 
Traveling via the movies: In case you were wondering, the planet
Tatooine depicted in ``Star Wars Episode 1: the Phantom Menace'' is
actually Tunisia. Meanwhile, the new comedy ``Notting Hill,''
starring Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant, was filmed on location in
West London. And the marvelously named ``Hideous Kinky,'' starring
Kate Winslet, was filmed in exotic Morocco. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Grand gifts: Celebrity Cruises has teamed up with Tiffany &AMP; Co. to
provide nice gifts for passengers on cruises that will greet the
arrival of the so-called millennium. All guests will receive an
exclusive millennium china box, inscribed with the ship's name and
voyage date. In addition, penthouse guests will receive a marine
chronometer, a solid brass clock framed in a solid mahogany box.
Royal Suite guests will receive Tiffany's solid brass Swing Clock.
And suite guests will receive solid brass travel clocks inscribed
with the ship's name and voyage date. For more information on the
variety of year-end cruises, see a travel agent or, on the Web,
visit www.celebrity-cruises.com. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Meanwhile, on Carnival: Among the gifts guests will receive on
year-end Carnival Cruise Line sailings is a bottle of Perrier-Jouet
Fleur de Champagne, Cuvee Belle Epoque, vintage 1995, along with
painted keepsake glasses. The 14,500 bottle-and-flute sets, with a
retail value of $2 million, are believed to constitute the
single-largest private order of its kind within the history of the
champagne industry. Carnival estimates that overall it will serve
some 50,000 bottles of champagne and sparkling wine on its 14 Fun
Ships during ``Millennium Cruises.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Britain's batty law: Sixty percent of Britain's 8,000 medieval
churches are home to bats _ and they can't legally be expelled or
even moved. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Mailbag: Mary Jane Kimball of Merrimack, N.H., passes along this
tip for cutting your waiting time in half at Walt Disney World's
new Test Track ride at Epcot: ``Tell the attendant that you want to
go as a `single.' They let you in a side door, which spares you
from the noise and racket of all the crash tests in the waiting
area and you are a fill-in for single seats. During the last week
in April, the line was usually about and hour and they kept
experiencing `technical difficulties,' but it is a fun attraction,
particularly for budding motorists.''

</P>
<P>
   What's bothering various readers: 1) high prices for hotels,
cruises, and whatnot to celebrate the arrival of the year 2000 _
sometimes as much as 10 times the usual cost; and, 2) long lines at
car-rental counters in Orlando, Fla. One reader said he spent 2 1/2
hours in the Alamo line. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Meals for 40,000: Korean Air's catering service in Seoul is a busy
place, with the ability to make up to 40,000 meals a day for the 32
airlines it caters for. The service, featuring Eastern and Western
dishes, is already an award winner, and meals should taste even
better these days because Korean Air has gone nonsmoking on all
flights. &QL;

Did you guess it? 45 degrees below zero. (With thanks to

NOOSA: NICE AND NATURAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NOOSA HEADS, Queensland, Australia _ One moment you're
sauntering along Hastings Street, peering into high-fashion shop
windows littered with Italian-labeled throw-me-ons of insubstantial
life expectancy but substantial price. Maybe you've had a swim in
the South Pacific, near enough to sometimes flood Hastings, the
town's main artery. And followed that by brunch on the sidewalk at
mellow Cafe Kokomo (``Just a name I liked. Nothing like Kokomo,
Indiana,'' says proprietor Andrew Powell.)
</P>
<P>
   No, certainly nothing Indianan around here. Though condos,
motels and homes spill down the low hills sliding toward the sea,
they are unobtrusively veiled by tropic greenery (home also to wild
goats), and there isn't much room for Noosa to expand.
Ordinary-sounding Hastings _ well-known to Australians who get
around, as Worth Avenue in Palm Beach is to Americans _ can't reach
any longer or wider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately,'' says restaurateur Powell. An Aussie who has
worked in the wearable rags trade in cities across the globe,
including Boston, he decided, ``This has it all for me and my
family. Near enough to Brisbane if we have to have a big city fix.
Sadly, so much of this coast of Queensland, the Sunshine Coast, has
been overbuilt like the east coast of Florida. But Noosa remains a
small beach town, a good place to raise our kids, a place with a
distinctive flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   A blend of quickly embraced chic and primitive for the
saunterer. It takes only minutes to get past Hastings's boutiques,
ice creameries, restaurants, public bath house and the Surf Club
(hangout of intrepid volunteer life-savers) . . . and plunge into
zealously-preserved wilderness. Gawking is good along rocky trails
that tilt, dip and climb through forests, beside and above
cliff-assaulting surf.
</P>
<P>
   And you might be lucky enough to encounter Ina and Tom Bergin, a
delightfully rare blend themselves. Six years ago, he, a burly,
bearded veterinarian-biologist-historian, hopefully proposed by fax
to her, a petite, dark-haired woman of innumerable talents (nursing
and diplomacy to name two) who was a couple of continents away in
East Africa.
</P>
<P>
   If you meet, Tom may tell you that the Noosa trails can be a
``health menace. You might get a strained neck looking for
koalas.''
</P>
<P>
   Worth the strain, though. Seeming furry footballs, latte-toned,
they nestle groggily on upper limbs of osteoporotically-twisted gum
trees, lulled to sleep most of the day by nature's maritime boom
box below them: heavy-metalically crashing waves.
</P>
<P>
   The ocean appears crazy, all right, at Dolphin Point where
surfers loll on their boards, waiting for just the right tide as
rollers hit the beach in a clanking of small rocks. The koalas
would tell them they'd be better off on a shady bough than a
capricious sun-baked board. Alexandria Bay, wild, too, is lined by
breadfruit trees with star-shaped leaves.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pacific's least pacific attack on the headland, gale
directed, is around a jutting corner, at a vertical notch called
Hell's Gates. So devilishly ferocious is the wind that you fear
standing close to the edge of the V-shaped incursion of
black-walled granite. Seventy-five feet below, the waves _ liquid
kamikazes _ crash and bash alarmingly, deafeningly. They, crush and
gush, roil and boil, steam and cream self-destructively
(nevertheless making an impression over the centuries), while
spewing silky foam that floats overhead like escaping souls.
</P>
<P>
   High winds and water have disappointingly cancelled a
long-planned boating/eating tour that the Bergins operate aboard
Walrus II, covering a neighborhood estuarial route they call the
Wild Duck Trail. Damaged in a storm, the Walrus is out of action.
</P>
<P>
   ``All right, mates,'' says ebullient Tom, ``we'll make it up.
You've been on boats before, after all _ but you've never had the
best part: Ina's cooking. You can still have that at our house.''
</P>
<P>
   Their Obi-Obi Cottage, a onetime gold miner's shack that has
been restfully refurbished after being moved from inland Gympie, is
out of the 19th century, the oldest house in Noosa. It is as much
museum as abode, crammed with art and artifacts from their
roamings, Ina's paintings and photos as well as exotic jewelry that
she makes.
</P>
<P>
   This is a dinner that takes hours and (don't count, please)
courses strung together by good conversation as joyous and tragic
stories of two extraordinary lives unfold, including the
long-distance romance with camels serving as matchmakers.
</P>
<P>
   It is interrupted by a siesta after the appetizers of sting ray
nuggets, barbecued duck accompanied by white wine. Delicious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time out,'' Ina commands after re-filling wine glasses.
``We'll continue when you wake up. We've got all afternoon and
evening, right? This is a gypsy meal _ I'm a genuine gypsy, by the
way. Gypsy hospitality is based on comfort, not perfection. Comfort
for the soul, heart and body. Sleep, please.''
</P>
<P>
   Very nice. Couches on a screen porch for the three of us, roomie
Aurelio and our friend, Ron Sampson, are receptive. We awaken
comforted, hungry again. Dreams of menacing sting rays did not swim
in our heads.
</P>
<P>
   More food. Chili con emu, huge shrimp called tiger prawns, cow
tripe. wild spinach with hard-boiled eggs. Delectable from her
touch. More wine, red. Wild fruit compote. Lemon-scented tea with
vodka (``A Tom bomb,'' Ina calls it.)
</P>
<P>
   What, no camel tail stew?
</P>
<P>
   Ina and Tom met at an African conference on the diseases of
camels, but it took a while for them to get over the hump from
formal introduction to love letters by fax. She was a diplomat, a
government advisor in Djibouti. He had taken a fancy to camel
research, and written a book (``In the Steps of Burke and Wills'')
about his arduous 1,000 mile journey by camel, tracing the 1861
expedition of the doomed explorers, Robert Burke and William Wills
from the top to bottom of Australia.
</P>
<P>
   A traveling man, no doubt, but a stick-in-the-sand compared with
Ina. Her odyssey began as a child in Khazakstan and continued
through a girlhood stained by massacre in Hungary, saved by escape
to Tanzania, an educational interlude at Stanford for a Ph. D, a
Middle Eastern first marriage, eventually another escape, from
war-rumpled Djibouti, to Tom's muscular arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of me died in 1956 when the Russians came into Hungary,''
she grimly recounts. ``A sister and I hid in the pantry as my
mother, father and six brothers and sisters were shot in the
kitchen by Russian soldiers. They found us. But, tired of the
bloodshed, I guess, only beat us with their rifles.'' She raises a
gnarled hand as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gunfire and explosions were so loud outside of my office in
Djibouti that I could hardly hear the phone call from Tom. `Marry
me!' he said. `You're drunk,' I said. `Yes,' he said, `but please
marry me.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sick of being around death, and the thoughts of
Australia and Tom were suddenly very appealing.''
</P>
<P>
   Happily ever after they've lived. Soon to be a movie near you?
Their story, only briefly sketched here, ought to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, we disagree a lot,'' she laughs, ``but life here is very
good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, yeah,'' he beams. ``Living with a gypsy isn't easy, but
it's worth trying.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without a camel as housepet.

   ``Paul knew exactly what it was: an ocean sunfish,'' says Lea
Goddard, who was leading the trip as a naturalist for the Cape Cod
Museum of Natural History. ``It's a really odd-looking animal.''
</P>
<P>
   The encounter was just the first adventure awaiting the campers
bound for the Monomoy National Wildlife Refuge on the island off
Chatham. The group, which had to hike 1.5 miles across poison ivy
and wetlands to Monomoy Point's 176-year-old lighthouse, also saw a
great horned owl, piping plovers, a family of gray seals, and what
Goddard thinks were coyote tracks.
</P>
<P>
   For lighthouse lovers, the Monomoy overnights and a similar
program at Race Point Lighthouse near Provincetown may be the
ultimate tour. But for the less adventurous, there are simpler boat
tours that pass lighthouses in Boston Harbor and along the state's
coast, offering splendid views of the mariners' best friends.
</P>
<P>
   For the Monomoy visitors, the most enjoyable part of staying at
the rustic, unstaffed lighthouse (besides the view from the top)
may have been waking to the knowledge that they were the only ones
on the island that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot think of another place where you are so close to
civilization and yet so far away,'' says Priscilla Reetz, 70, of
Brewster, who went on two overnight trips to Monomoy last year and
plans to go on two more this summer. ``Almost from the minute you
step on shore, it feels so remote. The sky seems wider, the smells
seem clearer, it's just the most wonderful feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Reetz, however, cautions that the trip is not for everyone.
``There's no electricity, water, or phones, and we bring the food
in with us. It's rugged,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   For those who like plusher arrangements, there are alternatives.
Colonial history buffs can take day cruises this summer out to the
nation's oldest lighthouse, Boston Light, which was built in 1716
on Little Brewster Island in the Boston Harbor. The 103-foot
granite tower was blown up by the British in 1776 and rebuilt in
1873. It is the last operating lighthouse in the nation that is
staffed around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``We land on the island and take visitors up to the top of
Boston Light, where they have this incredible view,'' said John
Forbes, a spokesman for The Friends of the Boston Harbor, which
sponsors the cruises. ``And while you're there, leading authorities
will give you the history of the place.''
</P>
<P>
   The five-hour $25 cruises to Boston Light sail on June 13, July
11, Aug. 14, and Sept. 11. Interested parties can obtain a
reservation by calling 781-740-4290.
</P>
<P>
   For advance planners, the Friends are also organizing a boat
trip up to Gloucester Oct. 2, which will pass close by a number of
lighthouses, including Boston Light and Graves Light. Today, the
nonprofit group is taking more than 100 people on a sold-out cruise
of the harbor lighthouses with a midday stop in Plymouth.
</P>
<P>
   Cape Cod visitors can take day trips to the Monomoy Point
lighthouse and to the Race Point lighthouse. The newly renovated
Race Point site is open for overnight visits starting June 1, and
that trip is considerably less rugged than the overnights to
Monomoy, which leave from Brewster three times a week until Sept.
1. (They also go once a week on Saturdays until Oct. 1.)
</P>
<P>
   For the Race Point excursion, ``People meet us at a designated
point in Provincetown and we have a four-wheel-drive vehicle that
will take all their gear to the Race Point lighthouse,'' says Carol
Dumas, manager of public relations for the Cape Cod Museum of
Natural History.
</P>
<P>
   The Race Point lighthouse, which dates back to 1818, has
electricity and thus a refrigerator. According to Dumas, the meals
prepared by the naturalists who lead the overnights, are as good as
at Monomoy. ``I know one of the naturalist's specialties is pasta
primavera,'' Dumas says. ``He's not Wolfgang Puck,'' Spago's chef,
``but the food isn't bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The overnights to Monomoy and Race Point, which include dinner
and breakfast the next morning, cost $130 for people who aren't
museum members. Advance reservations are available by calling
508-896-3867.

SHEER AUDACITY DELIVERS `MESSENGER' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 
The Messenger 
By Mayra Montero, translated from the Spanish by Edith Grossman
(HarperFlamingo, $23) 
 
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1999 Special to The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This much we know is true: On June 12, 1920, the great tenor
Enrico Caruso was playing the role of Radames in ``Aida'' at the
Teatro Nacional in Havana when a bomb exploded during the second
act.
</P>
<P>
   Caruso was not on stage, but there was no doubt that the
violence was directed at him. Cuba's standard of living was
wretched, yet Caruso, who was 47 and beyond his prime, had
contracted to come to Cuba for $10,000 per performance, an
astonishing sum at that time. Hostility toward him had escalated
after reports of high ticket prices appeared in the Cuban press,
and he had received threats even before he reached Havana.
</P>
<P>
   In the panic that followed the explosion, Caruso, still dressed
in the rich, white robes of Radames, is said to have run out of the
theater and into the street with other performers in Egyptian
costumes. By most accounts, this surreal gathering was short-lived.
No one was seriously hurt, Caruso's tour was a success, and by the
end of June, he was on his way back to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But what if the tenor's flight had not ended so quickly? What
if, after running from the theater, he had taken refuge in the
kitchen of a nearby hotel, where he found a beautiful young widow
who would become his lover and would bear his child nine months
after he left Havana?
</P>
<P>
   What if Caruso had disappeared with this woman for several
mysterious days after the bomb exploded _ disappeared with her into
a world of saints, superstition and flamboyant danger?
</P>
<P>
   Mayra Montero asks us to imagine this in ``The Messenger''
(HarperFlamingo, $23), a novel full of Chinese folk magic and
Afro-Caribbean religious lore, with the looming threat of Sicilian
thugs thrown in to spice up the deal. The story is amazingly busy _
even the smallest characters have their histories, their
melodramatic tales to tell _ and therefore occasionally laborious
reading. But for sheer, dogged audacity, no one could ask for more.
</P>
<P>
   The narrative is handled by two voices _ those of the aptly
named Aida Cheng and her daughter, Enriqueta. It is 1952, and the
59-year-old Aida is dying of cancer. In the spirit of final
disclosure, she agrees to tell Enriqueta the story of her affair
with Enriqueta's father, the great Caruso. Enriqueta, for her part,
diligently takes down her mother's words and searches for people
who were part of Aida's story so that she might record their
versions of it as well.
</P>
<P>
   Aida is the daughter of a Chinese man and a mulatta,
granddaughter of a Black and a Spaniard. From that frothy cultural
pool, she begins her story with a premonition: Five months before
the bomb exploded in Havana, she went to see her godfather, the
powerful ``santero'' Jose de Calazan, who rubbed her forehead with
coconut and lard, spit into the palms of her hands and prayed to
the saints. In doing these things, he foresaw the arrival of a
White man who was destined to bring misfortune to the sultry Aida.
</P>
<P>
   The man, of course, was Caruso. Aida, like a petulant child,
becomes devoted to him from the moment he rushes into the hotel
kitchen dressed as Radames. It's not easy to see why, for Montero
portrays the tenor as he truly was _ a fat, balding, spoiled man
who sweated constantly, smoked too many cigarettes and woke each
morning ``with shooting pains in his liver and the taste of gall in
his mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Aida loves him passionately.
</P>
<P>
   ``He smelled of the soaps that Zirato brought him,'' she tells
Enriqueta, ``but his tongue had the bitter taste of the cigarettes
he smoked, a taste that stayed in my throat for a long time. Years
later, little drops of that bitterness would still fill my mouth,
but I welcomed them, tried to hold onto them: They were the little
I had left of him, what helped me most to remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of ``The Messenger'' involves the lovers' flight from men
who want to harm Caruso. This part of the story lags, mostly
because its otherworldliness conflicts with Montero's
almost-journalistic decision to provide details of everything that
happens. Her characterization is more accomplished _ my favorite
was not Caruso or his Aida but Enriqueta, the daughter born months
after Caruso returned to his family in America. A melancholy woman,
she hungers for knowledge of Caruso's place in her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother and father were so passionately in love,'' she says,
``that perhaps, when I was conceived, they left me a little hollow,
distant with men, or fearful perhaps.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet she is her mother's daughter. ``We carry coincidences in
our blood,'' Aida tells her. ``We attract them like lightning.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it's the quiet coincidences of the sad Enriqueta
that bring this book to life. &QL;

BUKOWSKI: THROUGH A DRINKING GLASS CLEARLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 
Charles Bukowski: Locked in the Arms of a Crazy Life 
By Howard Sounes (Grove Press, $26) 
 
 By CHARLES KELLY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Charles Bukowski was a boy, his father used to beat him
with a shaving strop every time he failed at his weekly task of
mowing the yard so perfectly that he didn't miss a single blade of
grass.
</P>
<P>
   Bukowski had acne vulgaris, a disfiguring skin disease that
covered his face with pustules and left it pitted like a disgusting
moonscape. He labored for years at mind-numbing jobs _ Sears
Roebuck clerk, laborer in a railroad gang, mail sorter. Even as a
boy, he got drunk almost as often as he could.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a life beset by misery and characterized by excess,
Bukowski, who died on March 9, 1994, at the age of 73, built
himself into the one of the greatest proletarian writers the United
States has ever produced.
</P>
<P>
   His poetry and fiction are a travelogue of America's depths _
its lousy jobs, rank barrooms and scruffy rented rooms where
hell-raising, randy men and women battle for survival.
</P>
<P>
   Although a casual reader might dismiss him as sodden and
sex-crazed, his autobiographical novels ``Post Office,''
``Factotum'' and ``Women'' are considered classics, and his poetry
is world-famous. Many readers in Los Angeles, where he lived most
of his life, also knew him as the author of a column, ``Notes of a
Dirty Old Man,'' which appeared first in the radical newspaper``
Open City'' and later in the ``LA Free Press.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he remains an obscure cult figure for many members of
the American public, who are aware of him only because of the movie
``Barfly,'' a minor film starring Mickey Rourke and Faye Dunaway
that offered a glimpse of the life of a Bukowski-like character.
</P>
<P>
   In this biography, English writer Howard Sounes does an
admirable job of re-creating Bukowski's journey through the
underground passages of the American literary landscape.
</P>
<P>
   The book is even-handed. Bukowski is shown as a vulnerable man
and a good father who overcame great personal pain and tawdry
surroundings to succeed as a writer. But he also is depicted as a
regularly out-of-control drunk capable of hurtful and boorish
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Bukowski often satirized and made fun of people who had been
good to him.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, he wrote a vicious column about a friend of his,
drug-troubled poet and English professor William Wantling. Wantling
died shortly afterward of a heart attack. Although Bukowski felt
guilty about the tragedy, he still tried to pressure Wantling's
widow to have sex with him _ an experience she described as
emotional rape.
</P>
<P>
   The book doesn't shrink from describing such outrages, but it
also depicts much that is in Bukowski's favor: his lack of
pretense, his ability to enjoy life under wrenching circumstances,
his fortitude in the face of loss.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, Sounes credits Bukowski with being true to his art,
and to the simple style and the simple material he chose for his
writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyday life was Bukowski's subject matter,'' Sounes writes,
``not heroic deeds or glamorous people, but the experience of less
successful Americans living in cheap apartments and working at
menial jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The personal philosophy that underlies Bukowski's writing,
Sounes says, is ``a rejection of drudgery and imposed rules, of
mendacity and pretentiousness; an acceptance that human lives are
often wretched and that people are frequently cruel to each other,
but that life can also be beautiful, sexy and funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the blurriness of drink, Bukowski saw the world with a
clear eye. He chiseled a detailed portrait of it into his prose. In
doing so, Sounes shows, he illuminated many of the darkest corners
on the bottom side of American life. &QL;

   USCHINA _ China's two-decade effort to steal U.S. weapons
technology has positioned Beijing to develop modern mobile nuclear
warheads as good as America's, a bipartisan congressional report
said today. An ``insatiable appetite'' for U.S. technology leaves
China ready to leap from a 1950s nuclear weapons program to
sophisticated designs ``on par with our own,'' concludes the
report. The report describes a breadth of Chinese espionage that is
so threatening to U.S. interests that some members of Congress have
compared it to the theft of atomic bomb secrets by the Soviet Union
in the 1940s. The fallout could have a profound impact on the
operation of U.S. weapons labs and on U.S.-Chinese relations. The
House and Senate have called for in-depth hearings on Chinese
espionage and U.S. nuclear security. Richardson within days is
expected to announce disciplinary action against a number of Energy
Department and lab employees in connection with anti-espionage
lapses. (Carr, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   FLA-BISHOP-RESURFACES _ ALMA, Mich. _ Bishop J. Keith Symons,
the former leader of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Palm Beach,
Fla., resigned in disgrace last June after admitting to sexually
abusing five young men as a young priest more than 30 years ago.
The fallen bishop, who had served the five-county diocese of Palm
Beach for nearly eight years, was quickly and quietly whisked out
of town. He left a perfunctory written word of regret to the
220,000 Roman Catholics in the diocese. There had been no hint of
his whereabouts, his spiritual state or his physical well-being for
more than 11 months. Symons just disappeared. Church spokesmen said
he was in a treatment center but wouldn't say where. Last
Wednesday, he surfaced as the leader of a day of prayer dedicated
to the Virgin Mary at the St. Francis Retreat Center in Dewitt,
Mich., about 6 miles north of Lansing, the state capital. Attempts
by The Palm Beach Post to learn more of Symons' status were
unsuccessful. Telephone calls last Thursday from West Palm Beach to
diocesan leaders in Lansing were not returned. Spokesmen had little
to say. The church in Michigan quickly wrapped a protective blanket
of secrecy around Symons. (Gushee, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

an altogether different response _ a come-hither sales pitch worthy

is still the 800-pound gorilla, but things are changing and the
Sunshine State will likely not be the de facto choice for Baby
Boomers that it was for their parents and grandparents. (Belkin,

Tempest over Teapot Dome: The Story of Albert B. Fall 
By David H. Stratton (University of Oklahoma Press, $29.95) 
 
 By JON KAMMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What, you might wonder, does an academic's biography of a New
Mexico politician who reached his zenith about 80 years ago contain
to recommend itself to a general readership? The answer: an
interesting, illuminating tale with quite an ironic punch line.
</P>
<P>
   Albert B. Fall was a self-made man and bigger-than-life figure
who sought his fortune in the Southwest and Mexico through
hard-rock mining, practicing law and accumulating political power.
A prospector by nature, the colorful and charismatic Fall found it
easier to achieve wealth (but not necessarily retain it) by serving
as attorney for and business associate of the likes of Arizona
frontiersman William C. ``Colonel Bill'' Greene, the ``Copper King
of Cananea'' whose interests spanned mining, railroads, vast
ranchlands and free spending.
</P>
<P>
   After helping guide New Mexico to statehood, Fall was chosen one
of that state's first two U.S. senators. He quickly became a crony
of the virtue-challenged senator from Ohio, Warren G. Harding. As
president in 1921, Harding tapped his poker-playing pal to serve as
secretary of the Interior.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that during Fall's two-year tenure as guardian of
the nation's natural resources, he pocketed $404,000 from a couple
of tycoons to whom he granted leases to tap oil fields that the
government had been holding in reserve _ untouched even through
World War I _ in case they were ever needed to fuel the Navy. They
were the Teapot Dome field in Wyoming and Elk Hills and Buena Vista
Hills in California.
</P>
<P>
   Convicted of bribery, Fall in 1931 became the first American to
go to prison for a crime committed as a Cabinet member. Teapot Dome
stood as the nation's seediest scandal until Watergate came along
five decades later.
</P>
<P>
   It's way too convenient to tar Fall as a typical politico on the
take, writes David H. Stratton, the professor emeritus of history
at Washington State University who first began reconstructing
Fall's life and times for his 1955 doctoral dissertation.
</P>
<P>
   Stratton makes no apologies for Fall, but concludes that it
wasn't money that caused him to hand over oil-field rights. Rather,
it was Fall's ardent opposition to Progressive Era reforms _
primarily the budding conservationist movement and populist demands
for limits on corporate empire-building _ that made granting the
leases inevitable, Stratton insists.
</P>
<P>
   In Fall's view, the nation's resources were to be exploited for
the common good, and that meant unfettered industrialization. Such
a stance may be anathema today to Americans, and especially
Westerners, but here's the irony:
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Congress ordered that the Elk Hills field be sold to
the highest private bidder, and that options, including sale, be
studied for Teapot Dome, Buena Vista Hills and three other
reserves. Occidental Petroleum Corp.'s purchase of Elk Hills for
$3.68 billion last year was the largest privatization of federal
property in American history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Albert Fall must have started spinning in his grave with
indignation,'' Stratton observes. ``Even as an unflinching
corporation man he had never seriously proposed the outright sale
of the naval reserves.'' &QL;

STRAIGHTEN UP YOUR LIFE FOR BETTER HEALTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ ``Stand up straight! Don't slouch.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many of us, Kate Marchesiello heard those admonishments
from her mother while growing up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Posture was important for my mother, not to have rounded
shoulders and to hold my head up high and to have a presence when
you walk in the room,'' said Marchesiello, who lives in Glenville,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   In case your mother hasn't reminded you recently, good posture
is still important, and especially for adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No. 1 cause of neck and back pain is poor posture,'' said
Janice Novak, a Minnesota-based health education consultant and
author of a new book, ``Posture, Get it Straight!''
</P>
<P>
   Today's sedentary lifestyle often aggravates many poor-posture
problems.
</P>
<P>
   With many people spending eight or more hours at a desk every
day, typing at computers and answering the phone, it's easier than
ever to slump and slouch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've become a nation of professional sitters,'' Novak said.
``Everywhere I go, I see people rubbing their neck and shifting in
their seats.''
</P>
<P>
   Novak tells people that by simply standing up straight, they can
instantly slim down their waistline by an inch or more, akin to
losing 10 pounds. Good posture can also add the illusion of greater
height.
</P>
<P>
   Her explanation, highlighted in her book, makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the upper back slumps forward, it presses the rib cage
down on the abdominal organs,'' she writes. ``The belly protrudes,
making the waistline appear larger than it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a stance is not only unattractive, it can also take its
toll in other ways, including a gradual loosening and weakening of
abdominal and back muscles.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the more common causes of back pain is because our
stomach and abdominal muscles are out of shape,'' said Dr. Robert
Leupold, an orthopedic surgeon with Schenectady Regional Orthopedic
Associates in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   Leupold likens our middles to a barrel: ``If you take away the
stays in the front and the back, the whole barrel falls apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all posture problems, however, can be fixed by paying
attention to how we stand or sit. In some cases, especially with
fast-growing teen-agers, there may be structural problems in the
spine that cause a hump or round back and curvature.
</P>
<P>
   Although most schools offer scoliosis screening, parents should
also be on the lookout for problems. ``If they notice any
deviations, they should have it checked,'' Leupold said.
</P>
<P>
   Marchesiello is especially aware of her posture as the executive
director of the Kripalu Yoga Center in Albany, which offers yoga
and wellness instruction.
</P>
<P>
   In yoga, good posture is essential to allow the proper alignment
of muscles and organs. Such an alignment improves both circulation
and energy, Marchesiello said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk about pressing your feet into the earth and the crown
of your head up to the heavens,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you slouched through childhood and haven't given posture
a second thought since you left home, Novak emphasizes that it's
never too late to make improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how bad people think their posture is or how long
they've had poor posture, they can change it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   If you work at a desk, here are some simple tips:
</P>
<P>
   _ Make sure your computer monitor isn't too low. ``Eyes need to
be mid-level with the screen,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you're on the phone a lot, invest in a headset. ``Keeping
the phone receiver between your neck and shoulder will shorten
those muscles,'' she said. ``It's all these little things that
cause us tremendous problems.''
</P>
<P>
   By paying a little attention to your posture throughout the day,
Novak said, the benefits not only include less back pain, but a
healthier and more confident appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually am perceived as being younger than I am, if I must
say so myself,'' she said.

NEW AND NOTABLE BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1999 Special to The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A survey of recently published books:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; SHADOWS, FIRE, SNOW: THE LIFE OF TINA MODOTTI &QL; 
 &UR; Patricia Albers (Potter, $30)
</P>
<P>
   She is known more for Edward Weston's photographs of her than
for all of the photographs she made herself. After she died alone
in a taxi cab at age 45, her death certificate listed her as a
``housewife.'' Yet Tina Modotti was a remarkable woman _
independent, impassioned both politically and artistically, and
surrounded by controversy. In addition to Weston, (she became his
model and then his lover, her desire ``fueled by the authority of
his creative accomplishment''), she knew some of the most
interesting people of her time, including Pablo Neruda (the title
of this book is from his poem, ``Tina Modotti is Dea''d) John Dos
Passos, Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo. There have been other
biographies of Modotti, but this is the best. Albers had access to
two trunkloads of material from the estate of Modotti's first
``husband'' _ they posed as a married couple but were not _ that
included three dozen letters written by Modotti and 100 images made
by her. ``In portraying her,'' Albers writes, ``my endeavor has
been to keep one hand upon the tattered objects in the trunks.''
The result is a portrait of an enigmatic woman who has been called
the best ``unknown'' photographer of this century. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; TURN OF THE CENTURY &QL; 
 &UR; Kurt Andersen (Random House, $24.95)
</P>
<P>
   You're going to read lots of reviews of this book, an inordinate
number given that it's a first novel, a (begin itals) 659-page (end
itals) first novel. Andersen is, as they say, connected, and at the
other end of the tether are people any first novelist would love to
know. He is, as of this writing, a columnist for ``The New
Yorker.'' In previous incarnations, he was co-founder and editor of
``Spy'' magazine, editor in chief of ``New York'' magazine, and a
producer of network television shows. Before that, he had the
admirable foresight to work for several years on the staff of
``Time'' magazine, where his book has already received a full-page
spread (Annie Proulx and Peter Matthiessen took what was left).
Does the book work for its living? As a novel, no. As a manic
satire on urban life as we know it (or will know it next year,
which is when Andersen's story begins), yes, sort of. At the center
of its story are George Mactier and Lizzie Zimbalist, who have been
married 10 years and have three kids, a Land Cruiser, dueling cell
phones and a life that is blurry in its pace and trend-hopping
zeal. George is a former journalist who now produces a television
show called ``NARCS,'' a drama that dabbles in ``real'' life (it
is, George tells himself smugly, ``extremely cool television'').
Lizzie is a software entrepreneur. The plot is not easy to
describe, but that's not the novel's strong point anyway. What
carries you along _ and it's best to take it in doses, to avoid
overkill _ is Andersen's frenetic talent for skewering the shallow
accoutrements of George and Lizzie's professional and personal
lives, thereby reminding us of the deeper pleasures that have
escaped them. He does this so very well. He could have done it even
better in a shorter book. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; MY FATHER'S GUN &QL; 
 &UR; Brian McDonald (Dutton, $24.95)
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's grandfather, Tom Skelly, was a patrolman and traffic
cop in New York City at the turn of the century when the Police
Department was ``the most corrupt, brutal, incompetent organization
in the world.'' McDonald's father, Frank McDonald Sr., was a
policeman for 23 years, the last 14 in the famous 41st precinct,
Fort Apache. His brother, Frank Jr., an undercover cop and Bronx
detective, worked on cases that inspired books and television
shows. This memoir of a family in which three generations were New
York cops was written despite the ``blue wall of silence'' that
exists in cop homes as much as in precinct houses. ``But the
insular nature of my world has always left me screaming behind the
gag,'' McDonald writes. ``Cop stories are at root really just
family stories, filled with secret conflicts, shame, desire and
humor, only dressed up with sirens and flashing lights.'' Brian
McDonald was the wide-eyed younger brother, and he tells the story
of his family with a somber sense of both the traditions and the
hazards that came with its police history. When his sister died of
a viral infection, 30 detectives stood on the steps of the church
as her coffin was taken to the hearse. ``How strange it must have
been to see them there,'' McDonald writes. ``A funeral mass for a
4-year-old girl, guarded as if she'd been the mayor of New York.''
And yet being a cop destroyed his father's dreams and left him old
at age 47, and later Frank Jr.'s violent temper, combined with the
stress and disappointments of his job, almost got him thrown off
the force. This is a brooding piece of personal history from a
police department that is still troubled today. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; WORKING AT PLAY: A HISTORY OF VACATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES &QL; 
 &UR; Cindy S. Aron (Oxford, $35)
</P>
<P>
   At early 19th century resorts, men were permitted to gamble only
if there were no women present, ladies and gentlemen swam in
mineral springs at separate times, and everyone behaved impeccably.
Back then, vacationing was the custom of an elite class looking for
improved health. By World War II, it was a mass phenomenon. Aron
traces this evolution, and looks at the struggle with which
Americans face their vacations today (it's a love/hate thing _ we
want to take vacations but fear the consequences). ``More than just
yearly rituals in which we connect with friends and family,
vacations are exercises in self-definition,'' she writes. ``In
affording time away from the demands of everyday life, vacations
disclose what people choose to do rather than are required to do.''
This is as scholarly as a book about vacations can be, and
well-planned _ it's that time of year again. &QL;

 By PAUL KEEGAN  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Hiro's on a rampage. He's a vaguely Asian crusader with giant
muscles bursting through an armored torso, but since you're
watching the world through his eyes, all you see is his Ion Blaster
gun and dungeon floors and walls hurtling by so fast your stomach
somersaults into your throat.
 &HT;    Whoa, look out! It's Superfly Johnson _ Hiro's gargantuan bald
and black nemesis _ streaking by, blasting away with his Sidewinder
gun.
 &HT;    Hiro leaps to avoid the rocket-powered missiles, then pivots and
fires. Green laser beams ricochet off the fortress walls, exploding
like fireworks.
 &HT;    Superfly's fragged! Body parts drop from the sky like bloody
rain, gibs splattering the walls _ and if you don't know that's
short for ``giblets,'' slang for chunks of flesh, then you're a
llama, a newbie loser, and shouldn't be hanging around Kyoto 2455
A.D. in the first place.
 &HT;    ``Ha! Take that, dude!'' John Romero sits at his computer,
chortling. A colleague curses from another room.
 &HT;    It's early March, before anyone has ever heard of Littleton,
Colo., and the co-creator of the computer games Doom and Quake is
showing off his new gorefest, Daikatana. As Hiro, he has just
fragged a co-worker playing Superfly Johnson in a ``death match,''
a battle via linked computers.
 &HT;    ``That's cool, huh?'' Romero says. ``You can see how much more
visceral this game is.''
 &HT;    Romero is 31, with long, silky black hair. He wears tight
designer jeans and a black T-shirt. It was Romero, along with a
programming genius, John Carmack, who revolutionized the
computer-games industry in the mid-'90s with the seminal
shoot-'em-ups Doom and Quake, two of the biggest sellers of all
time. The pair made millions, bought several Ferraris each and
turned Dallas into the blood-and-guts capital of their industry.
 &HT;    Though they have since broken up in a spat over precisely what
makes a computer game cool, to hard-core fans they are still gods _
``the Paul McCartney and John Lennon of our business,'' says a
Dallas game developer who insists on being identified only as
Levelord.
 &HT;    Then the nation was suddenly confronted with the image of Eric
Harris and Dylan Klebold, both avid Doom fans, rampaging through
the halls of Columbine High with an arsenal of deadly weapons and
laughing at the ``gibs.'' For the mass-market audience that
developers like Romero have always coveted, the connection was hard
to miss.
 &HT;    Video and computer games had been criticized for violent content
before, but what happened at Columbine High instantly gave the
industry term for this relatively small game genre _ ``first-person
shooter'' _ ominous new resonance.
 &HT;    The same qualities that made Doom and Quake so
adrenaline-pumping, so unlike any other form of violent media, now
made them a primary target of outrage. These games plunge you into
a three-dimensional world where you must kill to survive, whether
your opponents are controlled by the computer or by real-life
rivals.
 &HT;    Romero refuses to talk now about the events in Littleton, but
when he sat fragging Superfly Johnson into bloody chunks, it seemed
that nothing could threaten this world he'd created. With a severed
head rolling one way and a rib-sprouting torso bouncing another, he
was perfectly candid when asked if he was concerned about criticism
of game violence.
 &HT;    ``I'm the one who made this stuff _ why would I care about
that?'' he said, not looking up from the screen. ``I make games I
want to play. If I want to see more gibs, I make it. If people
don't like it, they don't need to play the game.''
 &HT;    Shortly after Romero split up with Carmack and left their
company, Id Software, he scored a $25 million advance in 1996 from
Eidos Interactive, a London-based game publisher. Romero
immediately plunged $2 million into renovating the glass-bubble
penthouse floor of the Texas Commerce Tower, one of the most
prestigious office addresses in Dallas.
 &HT;    Today, oilmen who worked their whole lives to get into the
Petroleum Club on the 40th floor find themselves sharing the
elevators with the '90s version of Texas wildcatters _ techie
20-somethings wearing nose rings and cutoff shorts.
 &HT;    Ion Storm is an astonishing place, like something out of a
``Jetsons'' cartoon _ with walkways suspended above a maze of
stainless-steel cubicles, wall lighting embedded in marble sconces,
glass cases filled with models of one-eyed monsters, the whole
enterprise wrapped in clouds and sky.
 &HT;    It bustles with 88 employees, including screenwriters and
producers, developing three games at once and making plans to
branch into movies, action figures, comic books and clothes. There
are leather couches and giant projection screens, a locker room
with showers, Ping-Pong and pool tables, a million-dollar recording
studio for making game soundtracks and a special area for
death-matching that's linked to 16 television sets in a nearby
spectators' lounge. And, of course, all the junk food you can eat.
 &HT;    It's a dream clubhouse for game freaks, the kind Romero could
have only imagined as a kid drawing violent cartoons of
superheroes, hanging out in the video arcades and flunking his
classes.
 &HT;    While growing up in Tucson, Ariz., and Rocklin, Calif., Romero
was pretty much left to whatever engaged his imagination _ until,
Romero says, his angry stepfather, a retired military officer named
John Schuneman, crept up behind him while he was playing an arcade
game and smashed his face into the glass.
 &HT;    One of Romero's recurring cartoon characters was Melvin, a
crew-cut kid who was always getting blown away by his dad. Then
Schuneman noticed his stepson's fascination with computers and
bought him an Apple II+. Romero became a brilliant programmer, with
no interest in anything besides making games, and eventually made
his stepfather proud.
 &HT;    After high school, he bounced around several game companies
before landing a job at Softdisk in Shreveport, La. There he hooked
up with Carmack, a teen-age prodigy from Kansas City. In 1991, the
two split off to found Id Software and moved to Dallas to form a
partnership with Apogee Software, a company pioneering the use of
the Internet for distribution, instead of merely relying on floppy
disks sold in stores or through the mail.
 &HT;    Their first game, Wolfenstein 3-D, is considered the original
first-person shooter, letting players shoot Nazis in dungeons
adorned with swastikas and pictures of Adolf Hitler. It was an
instant smash, bringing in about $120,000 a month in sales.
 &HT;    ``Everybody thought it was awesome,'' Romero recalls. ``But when
we started playing, it was like, 'We have to have more blood, more
violence in there.' It seemed real, but we needed to show the guys
dying.' ''
 &HT;    Their next game, Doom, had a seismic impact on the computer-game
industry when it was released in 1993, just as the Internet was
coming of age.
 &HT;    Id's marketing was brilliant. You could download the first
stages or ``levels'' of Doom free. But once addicted, you couldn't
get the whole game unless you forked over a credit card number. So
many people tried to download Doom that it crashed the computer
system at the University of Wisconsin, on which it was posted.
 &HT;    By now, Doom and Doom II have sold about 2.7 million copies in
the United States, over the Internet or through retail stores (as
most software is distributed). Though it's impossible to know for
sure how many free copies of the opening levels were downloaded
worldwide, some estimates range as high as 20 million.
 &HT;    ``Nobody had ever seen anything as cool as Doom,'' Romero says.
``The music, the sound effects, how scary it was, the attitude,
weapons balance, everything was perfect about that game.''
 &HT;    But even as Doom and its successor, Quake, became wildly
successful, a fundamental disagreement erupted between their
creators about what made a computer game great. Was it Carmack's
specialty, the programming advances that allowed for increasingly
fast and realistic play? Or the cooler stories, weapons and
monsters that Romero dreamed up?
 &HT;    ``You don't watch a movie because it's 35 millimeters or 70
millimeters,'' Romero says. ``It's the idea of the movie.'' That
was when Romero started to succumb to what Carmack calls
``rock-star stuff'' _ maneuvering for fame instead of working hard
(a charge Romero denies).
 &HT;    As nerves frayed, there wasn't much question about which one
would have to go. Doom was a huge hit not because of its ``plot'' _
something about a marine stationed on a moon base that was so lame
that even people at Id can't recall how it goes _ or even the scary
creatures and artsy backdrops.
 &HT;    The key was Carmack's magnificent software, the ``engines'' _
the underlying operating systems that take full advantage of
increasing computer power and made him a programming cult figure.
Romero was handed his resignation and asked to sign it in 1996 _
though with characteristic bravado he says he planned to leave
anyway to start his own shop.
 &HT;    While Romero has yet to earn a penny through Ion Storm, Id's
revenues in 1997, the year Quake II came out, were $28 million, a
staggering $2 million per employee. With only small overhead _
mostly salaries and computers _ fully 80 percent of that is profit.
 &HT;    For Romero's next venture, Daikatana, he has actually had to
license Carmack's technology. In fact, one of the things that held
up the game, now scheduled to reach stores this winter, was the
wait for Carmack to release his latest engine. Why that's important
becomes clear when you sit down to play.
 &HT;    Sitting at a computer at Ion Storm, Romero expertly leads a
visitor through Doom, and at first it's hard to understand what all
the fuss is about _ fuzzy figures attacking, a crude pistol firing,
splotches of red appearing on falling bodies.
 &HT;    Then he starts playing Quake I and II, the next stops in his
historic tour of the first-person shooter. The ``story'' doesn't
change much, but as Romero moves through 1996 and 1997 the games
gradually enter new dimensions of realism. You can see Carmack's
programs becoming more sophisticated and taking advantage of the
soaring processing speed of computers and powerful 3-D
graphics-accelerator cards.
 &HT;    By the time Romero reaches Daikatana, the illusion is truly
remarkable. Physical reality suggests that you are sitting in a
chair operating a mouse and keyboard. But with the computer screen
replacing your field of vision, you believe you're actually
creeping around a corner, causing your breath to shorten. Afraid an
enemy is lying in wait, you feel your pulse quicken. When the
monster jumps out, real adrenaline roars through your body.
 &HT;    And few things in life are more exhilarating than spinning
around and blowing the thing to kingdom come, the flying gibs so
lifelike you can almost feel wet blood. Hurtling through the 3-D
environment can give even serious gamers motion sickness.
 &HT;    The technology pioneered by Carmack's shooters has spread to
other genres, and in recent years Doom and Quake have been passed
on the all-time best-seller list by titles like Myst, which takes
you on peaceful adventures to exotic places. Other games allow you
to build cities, simulate flying and play a big-league sport.
 &HT;    Still, it's telling that the first thing Americans wanted to do
upon discovering this remarkable new virtual world was start
shooting up the place.
 &HT;    Shortly after Littleton, a military expert appeared on ``60
Minutes'' calling shooter games ``a how-to manual for killing
without a conscience''; politicians howled, and then came the
lawyers. Last month Id Software was among 24 entertainment
companies named in a $130 million lawsuit by the families of three
victims killed in last year's school shooting in West Paducah, Ky.
It turns out that the 14-year-old gunman in that case, Michael
Carneal, also loved Doom.
 &HT;    Before Littleton, such talk sounded ludicrous. How could
clicking a mouse possibly help someone fire a real gun any more
accurately?
 &HT;    But shooter developers _ like the media that lionizes them one
minute and demonizes their games the next _ want to have it both
ways.
 &HT;    Most refuse to address questions linking games to the real
world, but even as he shows off his wares for a reporter, Romero
himself points out that the Marines have used a version of Doom for
training troops how to kill: ``They made a special version, an
add-on, so that soldiers played Doom to feel like they were in a
war situation, where you have one-shot kills.''
 &HT;    The ``one-shot kills'' argument is precisely the one made by Lt.
Col. David Grossman, the point man in the effort to blame computer
games for Littleton. Grossman teaches courses on the psychology of
killing to Green Berets and federal agents and has been hired as an
expert witness by the parents of the three girls killed in the West
Paducah shooting.
 &HT;    Not only do games like Doom and Quake help people overcome what
he calls the natural human reticence to murder, Grossman maintains,
they also counter the natural instinct for neophyte hunters and
soldiers to shoot repeatedly until a target drops.
 &HT;    The Kentucky teen-ager Carneal, he argues, followed the
computer-game pattern of moving quickly from one target to another,
with an emphasis on head shots. Though he'd never fired a gun
before, the teen-ager hit eight people with eight bullets, five to
the head and three to the upper torso.
 &HT;    And that's what makes shooters unlike any other form of media
violence we've ever seen before. You're not just watching a movie,
you're in the movie. You're not just empathizing with Arnold
Schwarzenegger as he blasts the bad guy to smithereens, you're
actually pulling the trigger.
 &HT;    Unlike a movie, this three-dimensional world has a peculiar
logic and set of rules that can be entertaining for hours on end.
Getting killed is a drag because suddenly the game stops, and the
only way to remain master of this intoxicating new universe is to
kill. How that translates to the real world varies according to the
individual playing the game.
 &HT;    For his part, Romero is pulling all-nighters to finish
Daikatana, the game that could confirm or destroy his legendary
reputation. It was originally scheduled to compete against
Carmack's Quake II during Christmas of 1997 but has been delayed so
many times that Romero is becoming the subject of ridicule in the
gaming press.
 &HT;    Now the consensus is that he'll be lucky to get it out by this
Christmas, two years behind schedule. Even his publicity agent,
Heidi Davis, says: ``The feeling out there is: 'OK, we've been
reading about John Romero. Where's the game?' ``
 &HT;    Romero is fed up with the criticism. Daikatana will give fans an
``awesome'' ride through 4,485 years of human history, he says,
armed with more weapons of annihilation that will destroy more
monsters than ever before. ``Nobody's made one like this before,''
he says, ``and I doubt that anyone's ever going to try to make
something this big again.''
 &HT;    In other words, for the shooter-game community, nothing has
changed since Littleton.

 By PAUL KEEGAN  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Hiro's on a rampage. He's a vaguely Asian crusader with giant
muscles bursting through an armored torso, but since you're
watching the world through his eyes, all you see is his Ion Blaster
gun and dungeon floors and walls hurtling by so fast your stomach
somersaults into your throat.
 &HT;    Whoa, look out! It's Superfly Johnson _ Hiro's gargantuan bald
and black nemesis _ streaking by, blasting away with his Sidewinder
gun.
 &HT;    Hiro leaps to avoid the rocket-powered missiles, then pivots and
fires. Green laser beams ricochet off the fortress walls, exploding
like fireworks.
 &HT;    Superfly's fragged! Body parts drop from the sky like bloody
rain, gibs splattering the walls _ and if you don't know that's
short for ``giblets,'' slang for chunks of flesh, then you're a
llama, a newbie loser, and shouldn't be hanging around Kyoto 2455
A.D. in the first place.
 &HT;    ``Ha! Take that, dude!'' John Romero sits at his computer,
chortling. A colleague curses from another room.
 &HT;    It's early March, before anyone has ever heard of Littleton,
Colo., and the co-creator of the computer games Doom and Quake is
showing off his new gorefest, Daikatana. As Hiro, he has just
fragged a co-worker playing Superfly Johnson in a ``death match,''
a battle via linked computers.
 &HT;    ``That's cool, huh?'' Romero says. ``You can see how much more
visceral this game is.''
 &HT;    Romero is 31, with long, silky black hair. He wears tight
designer jeans and a black T-shirt. It was Romero, along with a
programming genius, John Carmack, who revolutionized the
computer-games industry in the mid-'90s with the seminal
shoot-'em-ups Doom and Quake, two of the biggest sellers of all
time. The pair made millions, bought several Ferraris each and
turned Dallas into the blood-and-guts capital of their industry.
 &HT;    Though they have since broken up in a spat over precisely what
makes a computer game cool, to hard-core fans they are still gods _
``the Paul McCartney and John Lennon of our business,'' says a
Dallas game developer who insists on being identified only as
Levelord.
 &HT;    Then the nation was suddenly confronted with the image of Eric
Harris and Dylan Klebold, both avid Doom fans, rampaging through
the halls of Columbine High with an arsenal of deadly weapons and
laughing at the ``gibs.'' For the mass-market audience that
developers like Romero have always coveted, the connection was hard
to miss.
 &HT;    Video and computer games had been criticized for violent content
before, but what happened at Columbine High instantly gave the
industry term for this relatively small game genre _ ``first-person
shooter'' _ ominous new resonance.
 &HT;    The same qualities that made Doom and Quake so
adrenaline-pumping, so unlike any other form of violent media, now
made them a primary target of outrage. These games plunge you into
a three-dimensional world where you must kill to survive, whether
your opponents are controlled by the computer or by real-life
rivals.
 &HT;    Romero refuses to talk now about the events in Littleton, but
when he sat fragging Superfly Johnson into bloody chunks, it seemed
that nothing could threaten this world he'd created. With a severed
head rolling one way and a rib-sprouting torso bouncing another, he
was perfectly candid when asked if he was concerned about criticism
of game violence.
 &HT;    ``I'm the one who made this stuff _ why would I care about
that?'' he said, not looking up from the screen. ``I make games I
want to play. If I want to see more gibs, I make it. If people
don't like it, they don't need to play the game.''
 &HT;    Shortly after Romero split up with Carmack and left their
company, Id Software, he scored a $25 million advance in 1996 from
Eidos Interactive, a London-based game publisher. Romero
immediately plunged $2 million into renovating the glass-bubble
penthouse floor of the Texas Commerce Tower, one of the most
prestigious office addresses in Dallas.
 &HT;    Today, oilmen who worked their whole lives to get into the
Petroleum Club on the 40th floor find themselves sharing the
elevators with the '90s version of Texas wildcatters _ techie
20-somethings wearing nose rings and cutoff shorts.
 &HT;    Ion Storm is an astonishing place, like something out of a
``Jetsons'' cartoon _ with walkways suspended above a maze of
stainless-steel cubicles, wall lighting embedded in marble sconces,
glass cases filled with models of one-eyed monsters, the whole
enterprise wrapped in clouds and sky.
 &HT;    It bustles with 88 employees, including screenwriters and
producers, developing three games at once and making plans to
branch into movies, action figures, comic books and clothes. There
are leather couches and giant projection screens, a locker room
with showers, Ping-Pong and pool tables, a million-dollar recording
studio for making game soundtracks and a special area for
death-matching that's linked to 16 television sets in a nearby
spectators' lounge. And, of course, all the junk food you can eat.
 &HT;    It's a dream clubhouse for game freaks, the kind Romero could
have only imagined as a kid drawing violent cartoons of
superheroes, hanging out in the video arcades and flunking his
classes.
 &HT;    While growing up in Tucson, Ariz., and Rocklin, Calif., Romero
was pretty much left to whatever engaged his imagination _ until,
Romero says, his angry stepfather, a retired military officer named
John Schuneman, crept up behind him while he was playing an arcade
game and smashed his face into the glass.
 &HT;    One of Romero's recurring cartoon characters was Melvin, a
crew-cut kid who was always getting blown away by his dad. Then
Schuneman noticed his stepson's fascination with computers and
bought him an Apple II+. Romero became a brilliant programmer, with
no interest in anything besides making games, and eventually made
his stepfather proud.
 &HT;    After high school, he bounced around several game companies
before landing a job at Softdisk in Shreveport, La. There he hooked
up with Carmack, a teen-age prodigy from Kansas City. In 1991, the
two split off to found Id Software and moved to Dallas to form a
partnership with Apogee Software, a company pioneering the use of
the Internet for distribution, instead of merely relying on floppy
disks sold in stores or through the mail.
 &HT;    Their first game, Wolfenstein 3-D, is considered the original
first-person shooter, letting players shoot Nazis in dungeons
adorned with swastikas and pictures of Adolf Hitler. It was an
instant smash, bringing in about $120,000 a month in sales.
 &HT;    ``Everybody thought it was awesome,'' Romero recalls. ``But when
we started playing, it was like, 'We have to have more blood, more
violence in there.' It seemed real, but we needed to show the guys
dying.' ''
 &HT;    Their next game, Doom, had a seismic impact on the computer-game
industry when it was released in 1993, just as the Internet was
coming of age.
 &HT;    Id's marketing was brilliant. You could download the first
stages or ``levels'' of Doom free. But once addicted, you couldn't
get the whole game unless you forked over a credit card number. So
many people tried to download Doom that it crashed the computer
system at the University of Wisconsin, on which it was posted.
 &HT;    By now, Doom and Doom II have sold about 2.7 million copies in
the United States, over the Internet or through retail stores (as
most software is distributed). Though it's impossible to know for
sure how many free copies of the opening levels were downloaded
worldwide, some estimates range as high as 20 million.
 &HT;    ``Nobody had ever seen anything as cool as Doom,'' Romero says.
``The music, the sound effects, how scary it was, the attitude,
weapons balance, everything was perfect about that game.''
 &HT;    But even as Doom and its successor, Quake, became wildly
successful, a fundamental disagreement erupted between their
creators about what made a computer game great. Was it Carmack's
specialty, the programming advances that allowed for increasingly
fast and realistic play? Or the cooler stories, weapons and
monsters that Romero dreamed up?
 &HT;    ``You don't watch a movie because it's 35 millimeters or 70
millimeters,'' Romero says. ``It's the idea of the movie.'' That
was when Romero started to succumb to what Carmack calls
``rock-star stuff'' _ maneuvering for fame instead of working hard
(a charge Romero denies).
 &HT;    As nerves frayed, there wasn't much question about which one
would have to go. Doom was a huge hit not because of its ``plot'' _
something about a marine stationed on a moon base that was so lame
that even people at Id can't recall how it goes _ or even the scary
creatures and artsy backdrops.
 &HT;    The key was Carmack's magnificent software, the ``engines'' _
the underlying operating systems that take full advantage of
increasing computer power and made him a programming cult figure.
Romero was handed his resignation and asked to sign it in 1996 _
though with characteristic bravado he says he planned to leave
anyway to start his own shop.
 &HT;    While Romero has yet to earn a penny through Ion Storm, Id's
revenues in 1997, the year Quake II came out, were $28 million, a
staggering $2 million per employee. With only small overhead _
mostly salaries and computers _ fully 80 percent of that is profit.
 &HT;    For Romero's next venture, Daikatana, he has actually had to
license Carmack's technology. In fact, one of the things that held
up the game, now scheduled to reach stores this winter, was the
wait for Carmack to release his latest engine. Why that's important
becomes clear when you sit down to play.
 &HT;    Sitting at a computer at Ion Storm, Romero expertly leads a
visitor through Doom, and at first it's hard to understand what all
the fuss is about _ fuzzy figures attacking, a crude pistol firing,
splotches of red appearing on falling bodies.
 &HT;    Then he starts playing Quake I and II, the next stops in his
historic tour of the first-person shooter. The ``story'' doesn't
change much, but as Romero moves through 1996 and 1997 the games
gradually enter new dimensions of realism. You can see Carmack's
programs becoming more sophisticated and taking advantage of the
soaring processing speed of computers and powerful 3-D
graphics-accelerator cards.
 &HT;    By the time Romero reaches Daikatana, the illusion is truly
remarkable. Physical reality suggests that you are sitting in a
chair operating a mouse and keyboard. But with the computer screen
replacing your field of vision, you believe you're actually
creeping around a corner, causing your breath to shorten. Afraid an
enemy is lying in wait, you feel your pulse quicken. When the
monster jumps out, real adrenaline roars through your body.
 &HT;    And few things in life are more exhilarating than spinning

lifelike you can almost feel wet blood. Hurtling through the 3-D
environment can give even serious gamers motion sickness.
 &HT;    The technology pioneered by Carmack's shooters has spread to
other genres, and in recent years Doom and Quake have been passed
on the all-time best-seller list by titles like Myst, which takes
you on peaceful adventures to exotic places. Other games allow you
to build cities, simulate flying and play a big-league sport.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY _ ShortTakes: A nation of griping
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Impeachment, the most divisive issue of our time, was,
apparently, about the most forgettable. Most ordinary Americans
didn't see much to debate. Bill Clinton's personal conduct, most
thought, had been sordid and unworthy. They sentenced him,
reasonably, to a humiliating loss of respect
</P>
<P>
   Congress turned to new vistas of divisiveness. With Litttleton,
Colo., and Conyers, Ga., guns and the culture produced a new
debate, remarkable for its polarities. We seem incapable of arguing
except from only the most violent perspectives. Most people see
problems with both guns and the culture. They'd like to see a few
reasonable fixes, the kind any well-managed PTA could come up with
in an afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese espionage is the latest topic. Faced with a problem that
seems to have occurred over 20 years and at least three
administrations, politicians cynically play the blame game.
Republican leaders more than imply Bill Clinton traded atomic
secrets for campaign bucks. That sounds remarkably like treason.
Does anyone believe it? Nah.
</P>
<P>
   In need of thoughtful solutions, we continue to be treated - and
behave - like chumps.

   PERU-CUISINE (New York) _ Outdone by visions of gauchos on the
pampas, outromanced by images of Brazilian beaches and Carnival,
and overwhelmed by the familiar flavors of Mexico and the
Caribbean, Peru seems just an anonymous shade in the pan-Latin
palette that has painted many New York restaurants. But if you look
closer, Peru's is the color that shines brighter than the rest.

OAKLAND LAKE COMES WITH FLAVOR OF MEDITERRANEAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SELNA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ To gauge whether Oakland's long-awaited
cultural renaissance has yet arrived, you don't have to look much
further than Lake Merritt.
</P>
<P>
   Since February, the lake _ often promoted as the downtown's most
dazzling feature _ has been the site of Venetian gondola cruises.
</P>
<P>
   In a cultural harmonic convergence, a young couple docked two
gondolas at the lake right around the time Mayor Jerry Brown
announced plans to embrace arts and culture in a city long-maligned
for its gritty, post-industrial landscape.
</P>
<P>
   And while Oakland's gondoliers don't claim to recreate Venice in
the converted tidal slough that is Lake Merritt, they say the area
has a distinctly Italian feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This environment looks very much like a lot of places in
Italy: a Mediterranean lake, a beautiful city with hills in the
background and churches in the foreground,'' said Gondola Servizio
owner April Quinn.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, Quinn moved to Oakland with her husband Jeff
Fischer, followed by their two 40-foot, 1,300 pound, Venetian-built
gondolas. ``We very much hope to be a part of the renaissance of
Oakland,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn and Fischer, a Canadian-born Italian tour guide and
trained gondolier, considered other venues for their flotilla _
which they believe to be the only Venetian-made gondolas in the
United States _ but said Oakland was the only location with night
lights and a romantic Mediterranean ambience.
</P>
<P>
   History makes it a good choice, too, they said. The Terrace
ballroom in the circa 1920 Lake Merritt Hotel was originally called
the Venetian Room, and the first bridge built across the lake was
dubbed the ``Bridge of Sighs,'' after Venice's famous 16th-century
stone bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The couple's choice may have been right on the mark: Oakland and
much of the California coast are in the heart of one of the world's
five Mediterranean climate regions.
</P>
<P>
   The only other regions with this distinction, said Roger Urban,
author of ``Oakland A Mediterranean City,'' are in central Chile,
southwestern Australia, the Cape region of South Africa and the
Mediterranean Sea basin, including parts of Italy and France.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland's parallels to the land of the Renaissance may not end
there. Another obscure, unconfirmed detail reported in the 1998 New
York Times Almanac is that more artists live in Oakland than
anywhere else in the United States _ other than Greenwich Village
in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Oakland will ultimately develop into a thriving hub for
arts and culture is yet to be seen, but the results for Fischer and
Quinn have been promising.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn said she books about four cruises on weekdays and five to
six on weekends, including romantic escapes, weddings,
anniversaries and birthdays.
</P>
<P>
   Cruises may include antipasto snacks, candles and traditional
Italian serenades by Fischer. The last boat returns at 11 p.m.
before the midnight turning off of the Necklace of Lights that
surrounds the lake.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer practiced poling (gondola rowing) for 10 years on
weekends and breaks from his tour-guide work, and received lessons
from Venice gondolier Roberto Vianello.
</P>
<P>
   He met Quinn, who is of Italian descent, on a visit to Long
Beach. While there, they saw an imitation gondola boat ride and
decided to start their business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was tired of the vagabond life and she did not like the tour
guide stuff too much, so we decided to move here,'' Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
   They take their work as ambassadors of Venetian culture
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer commissioned one of the four Italian gondola
manufacturers to build one of his shiny black vessels and bought
the other from a long-time Venetian gondolier.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer said the boats were hand-fashioned from up to seven
kinds of wood and are festooned with gold-leaf ornaments and brass
fittings. A large, carved piece of walnut called a forcola serves
as the crutch for the lengthy oar the gondolier uses to propel the
craft. Fischer sunk eucalyptus poles in the lake's muddy bottom to
give the dock the feel of Venice and create a safe mooring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider this a continuation of the friendship of the
people who built our gondola and handed down the craft,'' Fischer
said.
</P>
<P>
   An Italian priest and the mayor of Venice christened the
couple's newly built gondola before it was shipped on a freighter
to Oakland early this year.

CALIFORNIA MOVES TO OUTLAW FUEL ADDITIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ The California Senate has voted to require
a warning label for gasoline containing a fuel additive that
supposedly reduces smog but can end up polluting the water supply.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, has already declared that MTBE _
methyl tertiary butyl ether _ poses a significant risk to the
environment. He recently ordered the additive to be gradually
eliminated from the gasoline sold in the state by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, legislation passed Monday by the Senate would
require a warning label on every pump that supplies gasoline
containing more than 1 percent of MTBE. The measure passed with
bipartisan support, 32-3.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by the National Research Council found that MTBE
is more effective than ethanol in reducing ozone, a major component
of smog. But the overall impact of either additive on reducing
ozone is very small, the study says.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency, which requires the
additives in areas that violate ozone standards, is the last
remaining holdout in support of MTBE and other oxygenates that are
designed to cut vehicle pollutants.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, MTBE has been traced from leaking
underground fuel tanks to about 10,000 wells in California,
including drinking water supplies in South Lake Tahoe, Santa Monica
and Napa. Because of its chemical properties, MTBE moves more
quickly through the water supply and stays around longer than
ordinary gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   If the warning label measure is passed by the Assembly and
signed by Davis, gas station owners would have until 60 days after
the bill passes to install the new labels. The state Air Resources
Board is working to develop a warning label.
</P>
<P>
   ``California motorists paid the tab for introducing MTBE several
years ago,'' said Assemblyman Don Perata, D-Alameda, author of the
measure. ``Now, they're being asked to subsidize its removal. It's
time for the oil companies to show consumers what they're paying
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Perata's label would read: ``Contains MTBE. The state of
California has determined that use of this chemical presents a
significant risk to the environment.''

NULLSOFT FACING SUIT OVER MP3 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HOYE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - You know you've hit the big time when:
</P>
<P>
   A) Major corporations line up to compete with you.
</P>
<P>
   B) You spend all day talking with lawyers and the media.
</P>
<P>
   C) All of the above.
</P>
<P>
   If you asked officials at Sedona, Ariz.-based Nullsoft Inc. and
San Diego-based MP3.com, they'd probably answer ``C.''
</P>
<P>
   Nullsoft (www.nullsoft.com) makes the popular WinAmp software
that allows computer users to play MP3 music files. The company
faces competition from heavy-hitter Real-Networks Inc., and is
being sued by PlayMedia Systems Inc. (www.playmediasystems.com).
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com (www.mp3.com) is one of the largest distributors of MP3
music files on the Internet. It faces competition from Web sites
such as Lycos Inc. (www.lycos.com), the popular Internet search
site, and has been named as a co-defendant in PlayMedia's lawsuit
against Nullsoft.
</P>
<P>
   In case you haven't heard of it yet, MP3 is a popular
compression technology that allows typically large audio files to
be compressed so they are easier to use on a computer or distribute
via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Such digitized music is nice to have on your computer, as it
allows you to listen to music without tying up your CD-ROM drive
with an audio CD. You can also download MP3 music to portable
Walkman-like players, such as the Diamond Rio (www.diamondmm.com).
</P>
<P>
   MP3 users need software to make it all work. Some use separate
MP3 players and programs that create MP3 files, sometimes called
``rippers.'' Some use software suites that do everything _ create
and play MP3 files.
</P>
<P>
   For months, the MP3 player market has been dominated by
shareware programs such as WinAmp. Recently, however, RealNetworks,
the folks who brought you RealAudio and RealPlayer, has come out
with RealJukebox.
</P>
<P>
   RealJukebox functions as an audio CD player and also allows
users to ``rip'' music from audio CDs, turn songs into digital
computer files using either MP3 or RealAudio technology and then
play them in any order.
</P>
<P>
   MP3 fans have flocked to RealJukebox since it became available a
few weeks ago. The free software _ still only available in beta
form _ reportedly has been downloaded millions of times.
</P>
<P>
   Why is it so popular? Probably because RealJukebox is free and
does everything. Other programs that both create and play MP3 files
are distributed freely as shareware, but cost $10 to $70 to
register. And most of the time, the shareware programs expire after
a short trial period or are not fully functional until they are
registered.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, PlayMedia Systems Inc., a developer of technology for
distributing music over the Internet, has sued Nullsoft, alleging
copyright infringement. MP3.com also has been named in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   PlayMedia alleges that its playback software was used in
Nullsoft's WinAmp player. Nullsoft recently agreed to stop
distributing copies of WinAmp that contain the disputed software
code.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com was named a co-defendant in the lawsuit because
PlayMedia says MP3.com promoted WinAmp and allowed visitors to
download copies of the software.
</P>
<P>
   PlayMedia's CEO Brian Litman was quoted by Reuters as saying,
``If, as we allege, the MP3 decoder in `WinAmp' infringed upon
PlayMedia's software, then by logical extension, MP3.com owes a
heavy debt to PlayMedia for our MP3 technology.''
</P>
<P>
   The naming of MP3.com in the lawsuit came just days after the
company said it would go public. The company plans an initial stock
offering intended to raise about $115 million.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for MP3.com declined to comment on the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   I managed to get Nullsoft spokesman Rex Manz on the telephone
one recent afternoon. It sounded as though he'd been talking to
many other reporters.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to commenting on the lawsuit, Manz was short and to
the point: ``We deny the allegations of copyright infringement.''
</P>
<P>
   While he was on the phone, I asked Manz for his his take on
RealNetworks' jump into the MP3 market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're encouraged because RealNetworks is a large company,''
Manz said. ``They have added credibility to the MP3 market. It
means the audience is growing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahh, life in the big time. &QL;

GEEKSPEAK EXPLAINED &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Looking for a great reference manual to keep by the computer?
Look no further than ``The Computer Desktop Encyclopedia, Second
Edition,'' by Alan Freedman.

10,000 computer-related terms. The book is so complete that I think
anyone would be hard-pressed to find a better single-volume
reference anywhere _ whether in print or online.
</P>
<P>
   The $45 book covers computer terms, both new (USB) and old
(punch card). It covers the history of the Internet. It explains
differences between Windows 95 and Windows 98. It has an
understandable definition of the Y2K problem. It covers Macintosh,
mainframes, laptops . . . you name it.
</P>
<P>
   Still not sold? The encyclopedia also comes with a CD-ROM that
includes everything in the book. Just pop it in your computer, and
you have instant answers for reports, homework or anything else
that requires an accurate understanding of computer terms.

GUIDES AT TALIESIN WEST GIVE INSIGHT TO FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT  
 (ADV: RESENDING TO FIX LEDE AND ADD IF-YOU-GO INFORMATION) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<P>
   SCOTTSDALE _ Let's make one thing clear: This is not Kitty Hawk,
N.C., and Frank Lloyd Wright is not one of the fathers of modern
aviation.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the misconceptions of some tourists, this Wright was one
of the great architects of the 20th century, and some rank him at
the very top. His legacy is the vision that led America away from
the European model of the 19th century, as is his ability to endure
and thrive.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1867, Wright died at 92 after a career that spanned 70
years. Each time the architectural community tried to retire him,
he rebounded with a new idea, a new vision. He was the original
Comeback Kid.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks in part to last fall's public television series ``Frank
Lloyd'' ``Wright,'' by documentarian Ken Burns, interest has boomed
in such Wright enclaves as Taliesin West, the winter counterpart to
his summertime Taliesin in Spring Green, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   The national broadcast of Burns' program and his appearance at a
Taliesin event last fall have brought an influx of visitors to the
Scottsdale facility, where Wright lived from 1937 until his death
in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   But the boom had begun even before the documentary aired, said
Suzette Lucas, director of external affairs for Taliesin West.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen a 25 to 30 percent increase over the last three to
four years,'' Lucas said.
</P>
<P>
   Tours once offered only during the morning in summer have proven
surprisingly popular when offered in the afternoon. More Valley
residents are discovering the charm of the historic landmark that
sits in their backyard, while out-of-town guests continue to make
up the bulk of the center's many walking tours.
</P>
<P>
   Summer hours begin June 1.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to regular one-hour, 90-minute and three-hour tours,
two new tours are being offered this summer: Architecture
Discovery, designed for families with school-age children, and
Night Lights on the Desert.
</P>
<P>
   At peak season, Taliesin can see as many as 12,000 guests pass
through its portals in a month. Even in summer, visitors still
number around 4,500 monthly. May's totals this year are expected to
reach 9,000.
</P>
<P>
   For architecture buffs, students and professionals, Taliesin
West ``is almost a pilgrimage,'' Lucas said.
</P>
<P>
   Wright's unconventional designs were considered the foundation
of American architecture, which finally broke away from the fussy
European Victorian style of the late 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   His philosophy emphasized creating buildings and dwellings in
harmony with their surroundings. At Taliesin West, he and
apprentices enrolled at the Frank Lloyd Wright School of
Architecture carried that notion one step farther: actually
building the walls of the structures from the stone that forms the
floor of the Sonoran Desert.
</P>
<P>
   True to Wright's vision, Taliesin West's most striking
characteristic is its location at the heart of 600 acres of virgin
desert landscape. The vistas are simply breathtaking. Before
suburban development, visitors could have seen as far as 60 miles
in the distance, a guide reports.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Wright stuff necessarily varied from project to
project as befitted its environment, Taliesin West evokes the
familiar geometric Wright, with sharp angles and straight lines
executed in rich woods and textural stone.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast the structures here with Arizona State University's
Wright-designed Gammage Auditorium in Tempe, which is softer and
more curvilinear.
</P>
<P>
   Another myth your tour guide will be happy to debunk: Wright did
not design the Arizona Biltmore Resort Hotel in Phoenix. But he did
act as a consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Taliesin guides are knowledgeable and eager to discuss the man
and his work. Tours are comfortable, exploring the property indoors
and outdoors, and offer a chance to sit in Wright-designed
furniture. On hot days, tourgoers are invited to borrow an umbrella
to screen the sun and encouraged to intake ample amounts of water
before venturing out.
</P>
<P>
   The gift shop is well-stocked with Wright merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Even visitors who arrive with just a smattering of knowledge
about Wright will leave knowing him better and with an appreciation
for the philosophy that brings Mother Nature into man-made
structures.
</P>
<P>
   Those elements are clear at Taliesin West, which your guide will
point out is not a museum but a working school of architecture that
accepts only 1 percent of applicants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a beautiful setting, relating to the desert in a
civilized way,'' Lucas said.
</P>
<P>
   And she's quick to answer the question before another tourist
can ask: No, neither of the Wright brothers ever lived at Taliesin
West.
</P>
<P>
   Here, it was Frank Lloyd Wright's imagination that took flight. &QL;

<P>
   Outdone by visions of gauchos on the pampas, outromanced by
images of Brazilian beaches and Carnival, and overwhelmed by the
familiar flavors of Mexico and the Caribbean, Peru may seem like
just an anonymous shade in the pan-Latin palette that has painted
many New York restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   But Peru has one of the great cuisines of the world. It is the
original fusion food, having absorbed influences from almost every
continent over the last 500 years and melded them with ingredients
and dishes that provide a direct link to the Incas. While it is
best known for ceviche, the marinated raw seafood dish, Peru's food
is remarkable for the diversity of its ingredients, from wonderful
fresh fish to astounding varieties of potatoes, corn and chilies,
and for preparations that encompass the world, from stir-fried beef
to pasta with shrimp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peruvian is the single most important cuisine in Latin
America, with a repertoire of dishes maybe bigger than France,''
said Douglas Rodriguez, the chef and owner of Patria, the
pioneering nuevo Latino restaurant in New York. ``But it's an
undiscovered cuisine, there's no doubt about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't tell that to Nobu Matsuhisa, the chef and a co-owner of
Nobu, who fell in love with seafood soup, purple potatoes and an
unfamiliar herb called cilantro when he spent four years as a young
man cooking in Lima, the Peruvian capital. Today, the Nobu menu
includes several Peruvian specialties, like tiradito, a cross
between ceviche and sashimi in which raw white fish is gently
flavored with citrus and enlivened with chili, then served
exquisitely unadorned, the thin slices fanned out like the delicate
petals of a flower.
</P>
<P>
   ``My food is Japanese technique and Peruvian influence,''
Matsuhisa said.
</P>
<P>
   He also includes several different ceviches and anticuchos,
grilled meats served on skewers, though he makes appropriate
modifications for his sensitive clientele. ``In Peru, you use cow
hearts for anticucho, and people eat it in the street,'' he said.
``We have Kobe beef.''
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese-Peruvian hybrid is not at all shocking, not to
anybody who remembers that Peru's president, Alberto K. Fujimori,
himself of Japanese descent, traveled to Japan recently to mark 100
years of Japanese emigration to Peru.
</P>
<P>
   More surprising might be the influence on Peruvian cuisine of
Chinese laborers, Italian settlers and African slaves, all of whom
arrived in the 19th century. But even that infusion pales against
one of the great cross-cultural exchanges of all time.
</P>
<P>
   Pizarro, who conquered the Incas in the 16th century, had come
to the Andes in search of gold and jewels, but the lasting wealth
he discovered was potatoes. Peru is the ancestral home of potatoes:
they have been cultivated there for thousands of years, and even
today, markets display dozens of varieties in astounding shapes and
colors, from little round purple knobs to twisted rosy tubers to
sleek golden cylinders. The Incas also grew hundreds of varieties
of corn, grains like quinoa and barley, and of course, chili
peppers.
</P>
<P>
   To these, the Spanish added garlic and onions. They introduced
cows, pigs and goats to a culture that derived much of its meat and
protein from the cuy, or guinea pig, which is eaten to this day all
over Peru. They brought cabbage, peaches and apples.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is Peru a junction for cultural interchanges, it is
also a topographical microcosm. Nestled in the Pacific shoulder of
South America, the country encompasses a huge variety of climates
and terrains _ from mountains to jungle to temperate coastline.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's most important is the sheer quantity, quality and
variety of the regional cooking,'' said Copeland Marks, who spent
months in Peru researching his new book, ``The Exotic Kitchens of
Peru'' (M. Evans &AMP; Company). ``You have an extraordinary
geographical location, right on the Humboldt Current, where this
cold stream of water produces a gigantic amount and variety of
fish. Then you have the tropical jungle of the Amazon River, and
then the frigid high Andean plateau.''
</P>
<P>
   Peru was blessed as well with its steady stream of immigrants.
Africans brought peanuts and yams. Italians brought pasta. And the
Chinese brought soy sauce, rice and cooking techniques like stir
frying, creating a blend of cuisines known in Peru today as chifa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't as if Peru just borrowed from Argentina and Chile,''
Marks said. ``It came from much farther away, from Asia and
Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a cosmopolitan appeal, Peruvian cuisine has not been
easily exported. Crucial ingredients like aji amarillo (yellow
peppers) and huacatay, a minty anise-like herb, are hard to find
outside of Peru. And of course, there is the basic unfamiliarity of
the food among North Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly _ very slowly _ this may be changing. The Peruvian
population of New York City, about 23,000 in the 1990 census, is
expected to have doubled by the year 2000, said Frank Vardy, a
demographer expert with the New York Department of City Planning.

PERUVIAN CUISINE IS WINNING FANS IN MIAMI 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JON NORDHEIMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ It is now four decades since exiles from Castro's Cuba
first arrived in Miami, and were soon followed by a small army of
family restaurants that served up heaping mounds of steaming black
beans and rice and other Cuban staples like fried plantains and
mojo, the fragrant sour-orange marinade.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for the spirit of Little Havana to spread
far beyond its downtown roots and embrace Spanish-speaking
immigrants from all over the hemisphere. They, in turn, opened
small mom-and-pop restaurants offering national dishes for each
homesick enclave.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a city where diners can sample the fare of a
different Latin nation every day for a fortnight. And, a few years
ago, it made Miami the birthplace of nuevo latino _ the exciting
fusion cuisine that is built on the zesty tropical tastes of the
New World.
</P>
<P>
   In the place where North America gets its first taste of the
cuisines of the southern hemisphere, Peruvian food has become
wildly popular with those bored with the relatively conservative
Cuban food, and other now-familiar cuisines.
</P>
<P>
   Peruvian food here is built around piquant but not fiery chilies
used as condiments for an endless variety of dishes and, unlike
most other Latin cuisines, an emphasis on seafood over meat. It
also tends to use less grease or oils.
</P>
<P>
   There are an estimated 65,000 Peruvian nationals living in South
Florida (some 750,000 nationwide), the Peruvian consulate here
said. They are faithful patrons of the 22 Peruvian restaurants in
Miami and surrounding towns in Dade County. But they are often
outnumbered by diners of other ethnic backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Cuban and I love Peruvian food,'' said Christina Beauvoir,
a Miami resident for 35 or her 44 years. Mrs. Beauvoir, an
embodiment of local multiculturalism, is married to a Haitian and
learned about Peruvian cooking through Peruvians on her husband's
soccer team.
</P>
<P>
   She had just finished lunch at El Chalan, a small restaurant in
a curb side shopping strip next door to a Colombian bakery and a
few yards from a Venezuelan restaurant. On weekends, the line to
get into El Chalan winds out the front door and down the block.
</P>
<P>
   A few tables away, Jerry Turberville, a retired businessman, who
was raised on a farm in Alabama, happily plowed through a dish
called jalea mixta, a seafood combination piled high on a wide
plate. His wife, Ernestina, a native of Lima, Peru, could not
finish a large bowl of Aguarditio de Mariscos, a medley crowded
with shrimp, mussels, clams and solid chunks of fish in a vivid
green chili and cilantro sauce.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's spicier than Cuban food, and the seafood is awesome,''
Mrs. Beauvoir said.
</P>
<P>
   But Peruvian cooking in Miami and elsewhere in this country also
suffers from a supply problem. Some purists argue that the
acclaimed quality of cuisine prepared in Lima, which is widely
regarded as the gastronomic capital of the Americas, is not
exportable because many of the fresh fruits and vegetables used in
its preparation are not available in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Imported frozen and packaged ingredients, they say, do not
adequately substitute for the taste of the real thing, and drive up
costs that endanger a kitchen's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Miami's Palacio de Jugos (Juice Palace) is a bustling market
crammed with stalls groaning under tropical fruits and vegetables,
many of them imported from the Caribbean, that fill the larders of
some of the city's best fusion kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   But potatoes and sweet corn from Peru, immensely more varied in
taste, texture and complexity than their American cousins, are
generally restricted as imports unless frozen or processed. The raw
products are capable of carrying disease or pests like the fruit
fly, which can threaten American crops.
</P>
<P>
   There are some 4,000 varieties of potato in Peru, and they may
be purple, black or as golden as egg yolks. Peruvian potatoes,
experts say, are starchier, more fibrous and have a richness of
taste unknown in American potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Tino's Place, a fine dining restaurant in Coral Gables, a suburb
south of Miami, has found the challenge daunting. After struggling
to establish a following for Peruvian dishes that are pricey
compared to what is available in other sections of Dade County, the
restaurant has reverted to an Italian menu.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep a Peruvian menu for those Peruvians who come here to
celebrate special occasions when they demand the best,'' Tino
Patera, the owner and chef, said.
</P>
<P>
   Regular patrons also know they can ask to see a Peruvian menu,
and Patera will have no problem coming up with several dishes like
corvina al ajillo con camarones (Pacific sea bass with shrimp in a
creamy garlic sauce) or several seviches, made with fish quickly
marinated in lime juice, hot peppers and herbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot do Peruvian dishes as fast food,'' said Patera's
wife, Lucy, whose mother and grandmother both operated restaurants
in Lima. ``We will not offer the Peruvian menu unless we have the
authentic ingredients.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Peruvian restaurants are not as choosy, and simply
substitute fresh domestic produce for Peruvian varieties. ``The
secret is to adopt ingredients available in this country and use
them to create a taste that is distinctly Peruvian,'' said Mario
Abieno, who owns El Chalan and recently opened a second restaurant
in Miami Beach, Chalan on the Beach.
</P>
<P>
   He substitutes Idaho potatoes, not as good or interesting as
Peruvian varieties, but still tempting when blended with his own
sauces and condiments.

ARMY AGREES TO ACCELERATED CLEANUP OF OLD BASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GEORGE RAINE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The U.S. Army will pay $100 million over four
years for an accelerated environmental cleanup of the Presidio of
San Francisco to accommodate the historic garrison's transformation
into a self-sustaining national park.
</P>
<P>
   The former Army base does not contain heavy industrial waste
like that found at shipyards or other military facilities, but it
does have numerous garbage landfills, buried construction debris
and other materials that would not be tolerated under today's
environmental laws.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement by the Army, the Department of the Interior and
the Presidio Trust, the board of directors governing the
transformation of the Presidio, was announced Monday by Rep. Nancy
Pelosi, D-Calif., who had steered the congressional legislation
that outlined the formula for the park's survival. By 2013 it must
generate $36 million annually through leased office and residential
space to fund its operating budget.
</P>
<P>
   The Presidio, an active military garrison for more than 200
years before it was turned over to the National Park Service in
1994, covers some 1,400 acres in the northwestern corner of San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Contaminated materials at the Presidio include pesticides,
metals and chemicals in soil. The landfills to be excavated include
building debris, household garbage and hazardous materials.
</P>
<P>
   The Presidio Trust will oversee the cleanup and believes 80
percent of it can be completed within seven years and the remainder
within 12 years, said Jim Meadows, the executive director of the
trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our primary concern is the water supply and the fact that
(contaminated material) could become part of the ground water
without cleanup,'' he said. ``The long-term potential is more of a
problem than any immediate danger.''
</P>
<P>
   The Presidio is not included on the Environmental Protection
Agency's Superfund list of sites containing hazardous waste.
</P>
<P>
   The Army had planned to conduct a cleanup over 30 years and
spend about $6 million. However, a negotiating team, headed by Mary
Murphy, a San Francisco commercial real estate lawyer and a member
of the Presidio Trust, approached the Army with a proposal to cut
the time by 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, we realized environmental cleanup was our
single largest infrastructure problem in reusing the park,'' Murphy
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first the Army was a little surprised at our proposal ...
but we gained a certain momentum after a point, and people became
committed to it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi said it was the first time ever that federal agencies
have successfully developed a public-private partnership to conduct
a comprehensive environmental cleanup of a closed military base.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agreement is a symbol of how innovative ideas can be
realized in a tangible way to benefit the public good and U.S.
taxpayers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The $100 million from the U.S. Army announced Monday is separate
from the Army's payment of $64 million for Presidio cleanup
announced in April 1995.

<P>
   A sure of Memorial Day _ along with the appearance of picnic
coolers and barbecue tools _ is usually a deluge of ice cream
books. But this year, there is only a sprink-ling on bookstore
shelves. Has it become too easy just to buy a pint of passion fruit
or chocolate-chocolate-chocolate chunk?
</P>
<P>
   For those who insist on homemade ice cream in summer, or who
still prefer it without locust-bean gum, there is ``The Ultimate
Ice Cream Book,'' by Bruce Weinstein (William Morrow &AMP; Co., $15).
The author, a food consultant, does a reasonably thorough job with
recipes, from the basic to the creative, like key lime, lavender
and a delicious fig. Does pushing the envelope with the likes of
avocado and corn make it ultimate? Not with vanilla-fudge missing.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction describes several kinds of ice-cream makers and
gives pros and cons for each. Most of the recipes yield a quart and
cannot be made in a single batch in one of those small
freezer-canister types.
</P>
<P>
   There are two kinds of ice cream: the French style, made in a
custard base, and the simpler Philadelphia style, with cream but no
eggs. The book offers hundreds of recipes, including variations.
With fresh ripe fruit like strawberries, for example, the
Philadelphia version results in a brighter taste and is quicker to
make.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the recipes are in the French style. A few make the
custard step easier by combining the eggs and a flavoring
ingredient, like figs, in a food processor, and then pouring sugar
and scalded milk or half-and-half while the machine is on. No
danger of curdling with this method, though the eggs don't cook as
thoroughly. With the shortcut, the results were just as rich and
smooth.
</P>
<P>
   The recipes for sorbets and granitas, like those for ice creams,
are in alphabetical order, each with several possible variations,
like maple cider instead of plain cider. A scoop of herb-flecked
cucumber sorbet makes a nice addition to a cold summer soup. There
are also some recipes for soda fountain drinks, ice cream toppings
and ice cream cones. But no new-wave smoothies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Smoothie Deck,'' by Mary Corpening Barber, Sara Barber and
Lori Lyn Narlock (Chronicle Books, $12.95), is a deck of 52 cards,
50 of them with recipes for thick blender drinks made with
everything from fruit and sorbet to yogurt and tahini. Most can be
ready in a twinkling, assuming the preliminaries have been taken
care of, like freezing fruit. Several are spiked with alcohol, and
even some that are not can take a splash of something from the bar.
</P>
<P>
   The cards are handy and attractive, with photographs of frosty
drinks on one side and the recipe on the other. But they could
easily be misplaced, and there is no index. So, unless you do card
tricks, pulling out the right one could take some shuffling.

A SAVORY SUMMER 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 This is the first of eight columns by Thomas Keller, the chef and
owner of the French Laundry in Yountville, Calif., widely regarded
as one of America's most innovative restaurants. His collaborator
on these columns is Michael Ruhlman.  
 By THOMAS KELLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   YOUNTVILLE, Calif. _ In New York City, it seems to me,
restaurants are all about interior. Here, it's the outdoors, the
Napa Valley itself, that sets the tone and guides our expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The fresh produce is everywhere, especially as spring turns to
summer. The grapes have only finished budding and are months away
from harvest in the fall. But apricots have just arrived, and so
have peas, spring garlic, cherries and fuzzy green almonds.
</P>
<P>
   We're picking sugar snap peas from our garden, and our lettuces
and herbs _ thyme, tarragon, rue _ have taken off. It may be the
best place in America to be cooking at this very moment.
</P>
<P>
   With so much to offer, it would be a pity to limit a meal to two
or three large courses. But more than that, our interest in any
single dish diminishes precipitously after the second or third
bite. It's the same as stepping into a hot bath _ the initial
sensation is jolting, but gradually you become used to the
temperature, and don't even think about it.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I like to present a series of five to nine intensely
focused courses. I want my customers to experience the jolt, the
new sensation on the palate, and then to move on to another one.
</P>
<P>
   The first dish everyone receives upon being seated is what we
call a cornet, a small cone filled with salmon tartare and creme
fraiche. It looks like summer, a miniature pink ice cream cone. The
cornet is an amuse-bouche in the fullest sense. It first amuses the
eye: people smile when they see it. And it amuses the palate: fresh
salmon, seasoned with lemon-infused oil, a crunchy tuile cone, and
cool creme fraiche flavored with minced red onion.
</P>
<P>
   The pleasure I derive from serving this dish remains, in part, a
result of its origins, which occurred during a sad time in my life.
</P>
<P>
   I was leaving New York after 10 years of cooking there. Rakel,
the restaurant I'd owned with Serge Raoul, had failed with the
economic downturn of the late 1980s. I'd become a restaurant
consultant, a miserable experience. And then I'd accepted a job as
chef at a restaurant called Checkers in Los Angeles, and would be
moving to an unfamiliar city (a way station, as it turned out, on
my journey to Napa).
</P>
<P>
   My new boss wanted me to prepare a dish for a food and wine
benefit in Los Angeles that would really wow people and introduce
me to the community. I knew people would be standing, probably
holding a glass of wine, so whatever I came up with couldn't
require silverware. And it had to be original. There was a lot of
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   I'd been serving a simple garlic tuile for a long time _ flour,
eggs, salt, butter, garlic paste and Parmesan. I cooked it flat and
serve it with rabbit. We also baked it partly folded, as an
American-style taco shell.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before I moved from New York, some friends took me to a
favorite restaurant in Chinatown and, as always, to Baskin-Robbins
for ice cream afterward. This food and wine party was in the back
of my mind the whole time.
</P>
<P>
   I ordered an ice cream cone, and when it was extended to me in
its holder, I didn't see a sugar cone _ I saw a tuile. There it
was: I would fill a tuile with tuna tartare. There's my dish, I
thought.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, I know, this was a mundane moment. But the fact
is, that's often how inspiration arrives, not mysteriously but as a
burst within the course of everyday events. How many ice cream
cones had I eaten before without creating anything? Just then,
though, anxious and depressed, my cone became my cornet, a festive
opener that makes people happy.
</P>
<P>
   At the restaurant, I present the cornets in acrylic holders made
for this purpose, but they would be just as striking served in a
bowl filled with dry rock salt. It's an easy presentation, and it
looks a little like a bowl of crushed ice, which seems like a
perfect way to serve trompe l'oeil ice cream cones.
</P>
<P>
   I now use salmon, but you can fill the cornets with almost
anything. Eggplant caviar and roasted peppers or tomato confit is a
vegetarian version. You could do it with meat _ a julienne of
prosciutto with some melon. The tuile is a vessel. Fill it with
your imagination.

   CORNETS OF ATLANTIC SALMON TARTARE WITH SWEET RED ONION CREME
FRAICHE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces sushi-quality salmon fillet (belly preferred), very
finely minced
</P>
<P>
   } teaspoon extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   } teaspoon lemon oil
</P>
<P>
   1{ teaspoons finely minced chives
</P>
<P>
   1{ teaspoons finely minced shallots
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground white pepper
</P>
<P>
   { cup creme fraiche
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon finely minced red onions, rinsed and dried
</P>
<P>
   7 tablespoons all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   4 teaspoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   { cup (1 stick) butter, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   2 egg whites, chilled
</P>
<P>
   1 to 2 tablespoons black sesame seeds
</P>
<P>
   24 inchlong chive tips, for garnish.
</P>
<P>
   1. Prepare the salmon tartare: in a small bowl, combine minced
salmon, olive oil, lemon oil, minced chives and shallots. Mix well,
and season with { teaspoon salt and a pinch of pepper. Cover and
refrigerate until well chilled, at least 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   2. Prepare the sweet red onion creme fraiche: in a small mixing
bowl, whisk creme fraiche until it holds soft peaks, 30 seconds to
1 minute. Fold in the minced red onions, and season to taste with
salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate until needed.
</P>
<P>
   3. Prepare the cornets: preheat oven to 400 degrees. In a
medium-size mixing bowl, combine flour, sugar and 1 teaspoon salt.
In a separate bowl, whisk butter until it is like mayonnaise in
texture. Add egg whites to flour mixture, mixing with a wooden
spoon until they are completely incorporated. Whisk in the softened
butter by thirds, until batter is creamy and smooth.
</P>
<P>
   4. Make a 4-inch-wide circular stencil by cutting a hole in a
large plastic lid or other piece of heavy plastic. Have ready a
large baking sheet, a Silpat nonstick baking sheet liner or
parchment paper and 12 cornet molds (Size 35, 4{ inches). Place the
Silpat liner or parchment on baking sheet. Holding stencil flat,
place a spoonful of batter in center of hole, and spread evenly
with an offset spatula. The batter should be just thick enough so
that it is opaque with no thin spots; remove any excess batter.
Lift stencil, and repeat process until you have 12 rounds; leave 1{
inches between the rounds of batter. Sprinkle each round with [
teaspoon black sesame seeds. Bake until batter is set and just
beginning to brown, about 4 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   5. Open oven, and place baking sheet on door, to keep rounds
warm and flexible. Flip a round over, sesame side down, and place a
cornet mold at one side. Form the cornet by tucking the dough up at
the bottom (small) end and rolling dough tightly around mold.
Leaving the cornet wrapped around the mold, arrange it seam side
down. Repeat with remaining rounds of dough, allowing rolled
cornets to lean against each other to prevent them from rolling.
Return baking sheet to oven, and bake 2 to 3 minutes longer to set
the seam and to let them reach a golden brown. Remove from oven and
cool slightly, then remove molds. Cool cornets on paper towels.
Repeat entire process with remaining batter to make 12 more.
Cornets may be stored in an airtight container for up to 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   6. To assemble, use a pastry bag or small knife to fill each
cornet with { inch of red onion creme fraiche. Spoon about 1{
teaspoons of salmon tartare over the creme fraiche, and mound so
the dome resembles the ice cream in a cone. Press a chive tip
against one side of the tartare on each cone for garnish. Serve
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 24 filled cornets.

A LIFE AMONG CATTLE HELPS HIM TEACH ABOUT THE FORT WORTH HERD,
HISTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH _ For 64-year-old Tom B. Saunders IV, work has never
been a distant stranger. As a boy, he worked in the boiling heat of
the Fort Worth Stockyards; the rest of his life, he worked cattle
on his family ranch in Parker County.
</P>
<P>
   Cattle have always been an integral part of his life. His family
goes back to the trail-driving days in Texas, to the establishment
of commission houses in the Fort Worth yards, to today's everyday
ranching.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in addition to his other daily chores, Saunders is the
historian for the Fort Worth Herd _ longhorn cattle that signify
Fort Worth's 150-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Because the city of Fort Worth owns the herd, Saunders is now a
part-time city employee. It is an unusual situation for the
lifelong cattleman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Punching that clock is a strange thing to me,'' Saunders said.
``I don't even wear a watch. When the sun comes up, work starts;
when it goes down again, that's the end of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Saunders, his daily dress doesn't have to
change. He still wears his bluejeans tucked inside his boots. His
suspenders look fine; so does the straw hat he wears to fend off
the early summer sun.
</P>
<P>
   He probably couldn't change any of that if he wanted. And he
doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Even Saunders' job responsibility isn't greatly different from
anything else he's ever done. He isn't on the city payroll to
wrangle horses or herd the cattle. He's there to teach the other
cowhands the history of their profession and Fort Worth's livestock
heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just getting them straight,'' he said. ``I had to OK the
saddles, the chaps, their clothing. Everything they've got on
except their underwear is period.''
</P>
<P>
   Saunders is emphasizing the 1890s, when cattle drives died out
and terminal markets like Fort Worth were on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us a chance to talk about the Fort Worth yards and
how they were important to Fort Worth. The yards were the largest
employers in Fort Worth for years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His is an unlikely classroom. There are five or six cowhands
sitting around his Stockyards office or out squatting in the
pasture grasses among the cattle.
</P>
<P>
   They discuss the old times, the customs, the ethics. Saunders
teaches from lesson plans his wife, Ann _ a schoolteacher _ helped
him develop. Then the hands, some women, some men, begin to quiz
one another. They constantly test each other, Saunders said, and
they enjoy the challenge of learning.
</P>
<P>
   They will become more than cowhands when the longhorn herd moves
to the Stockyards next month. They will become ambassadors for the
city, and they will be expected to give accurate answers to
visitors' questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a real pleasure,'' Saunders said of the lessons.
``I'm looking forward to working with children on this project. I
want them to know that ranchers are probably the greatest
caretakers of the land. We are really growers of grass. I want them
to know we take care of our livestock and that you can't starve a
profit from a cow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want them to know where all those hamburgers come from.''

OH, FOR TIME TO STAND IN LINE ALL DAY LONG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Star Wars: Episode 1 _ The Phantom Menace. Now showing at a
theater near you!''
</P>
<P>
   Duh.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you've been walking around with a crock pot on your head,
there is no way that you've missed all the ballyhoo surrounding
George Lucas' latest big-screen saga.
</P>
<P>
   Before opening night, hundreds of ``Star Wars'' fans around the
country camped outside of theaters so that they could be the first
to see this action adventure film.
</P>
<P>
   I've heard a lot of negative comments about these incredibly
patient people. The most common question centers around the single
interrogative, ``Why?'' As in, why would anyone put their life on
hold to get tickets to a movie that's showing on a minimum of two
screens at half of the theaters in the country?
</P>
<P>
   I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess that the movie will
be around for at least a few weeks. Call me psychic.
</P>
<P>
   The can't-afford-to-miss-a-day-at-work crowd passed these folks
on their way to the office and yelled out of their car windows,
``Get a life!'' But I'm not marching with that band because I would
love to have hours and hours to while away without an itinerary or
deadline. If you've got time to burn and you can still manage to
pay your bills, then bully for you.
</P>
<P>
   My only question regarding these avid fans and their diligence
is simply, ``Isn't that loitering?''
</P>
<P>
   Don't most cities have ordinances against congregating in front
of businesses without a permit or something? I mean, like, what if
a bunch of shopaholics parked their trailer homes in front of a
mall that's under construction? Wouldn't someone raise an eyebrow?
Wouldn't security make them disperse?
</P>
<P>
   Sure, I wait for things all the time.
</P>
<P>
   I'll give a restaurant 20 to 30 minutes to seat my party of four
on a Saturday night. And long, long ago, I stood in line for two
hours to buy tickets to a concert featuring George Clinton and the
Funkadelics, but that was the ``Aqua Boogie Tour'' after all.
</P>
<P>
   So I'm not judging anybody. Live and let live.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, I made five phone calls today and each time I was put
on hold.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, with all the time I've wasted on that, I could have seen
Star Wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``May the force be with you.''

SAN FRANCISCO'S WAGE BILL HITS A SNAG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GREGORY LEWIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A so-called ``living wage'' measure now before
the Board of Supervisors here has hit a snag.
</P>
<P>
   The ordinance, proposed by Board President Tom Ammiano earlier
this month would require employers who hold service contracts with
the city to pay their workers at least $11 an hour and provide
health benefits or a cash equivalent to them. The mandate also
would apply to businesses that lease property from the city, such
as those on port and airport property.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Mabel Teng introduced a motion this week asking for
an independent economic analysis on the controversial proposal _ a
move that would delay Board action on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are too many unanswered questions to make an informed
decision,'' Teng said at Monday's board meeting. ``How many people
will benefit? How much it will cost us? ... We don't know where the
dollars will come from.''
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano said after the meeting, ``I think the delay stinks.'' He
charged that putting off the vote was typical of ``the disconnect
of what the public wants and what happens in city government. The
delay is colonial. The motivation behind the delay is from people
who are well-fed and well-housed.''
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano said a lot of research on the living wage issue is
available for those who want to see it, but he said some board
members don't want to vote on the issue until after the city's
November election.
</P>
<P>
   Teng questioned the adequacy of the research. ``I have not seen
numbers,'' she said, adding that she is not opposed to increasing
the wages of low-income workers. ``If Ammiano has a study, I'd like
to see it. The Living Wage Coalition said it would cost $10 million
but had no explanation. City departments say it will cost $192
million. Those are the only two I have seen, and the disparity is
great.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can the board make an informed decision, spending
taxpayers' money if we don't know the cost?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Josie Mooney, president of the San Francisco Labor Council and
head of Local 790 of the Service Employees International Union,
said, ``I find it surprising that Supervisor Teng wants San
Francisco to be the last in the nation to pass living wage
(legislation). While she wants to study it, low-income people still
will make $5.75 an hour and have to work two and three jobs to pay
the rent,'' Mooney said.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano has described his legislation as the most sweeping
effort of its kind in the nation to raise the standard of living
for thousands of working poor.
</P>
<P>
   The current minimum wage in California is $5.75 an hour. A
person working full time earning the living wage envisioned by
Ammiano would pull in $22,800 a year, $10,840 more than a minimum
wage earner.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano wants the law to kick in next year in order to give
contract agencies enough time to adjust.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would exempt businesses with five or fewer
employers and those with city contracts worth less than $25,000 a
year. Also exempted would be employees under age 21 who are working
in after-school or summer jobs, employees in short-term training
programs that will help them into higher-wage jobs, and disabled
workers in special federal jobs programs.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eight jurisdictions in the United States, among them
Oakland and San Jose, have a living wage law on the books. San
Francisco's would ensure the highest pay and be the first to
include businesses that lease city property.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Willie Brown has said he would sign any reasonable
measure.

Y2K BUG COULD KO THE VCR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JAN JARVIS and JOHN AUSTIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The VCR you programmed ahead of time to
record Dick Clark's New Year's countdown refuses to work.
</P>
<P>
   The microwave fails to defrost a pound of hamburger. And the
programmable thermostat has decided it doesn't matter if the
temperature is plunging to 10 below and there's snow on the ground.
The heater isn't coming on.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to 2000. Forget food shortages, electrical outages and
rioting in the streets. It's the little things that are more likely
to get people down when the Y2K crisis calls on consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to tell people these are things that won't
work,'' said Karen Anderson, founder of Y2Kwomen, an organization
dedicated to promoting Y2K awareness. ``What I want to say is look
at the things around your house that you're dependent on. If the
bread machine doesn't work it's not a huge deal but if the computer
doesn't _ and that's how you make a living _ it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, most consumers won't know for sure what will
work and what won't until they turn on their computer, VCR or
appliance. And to make matters worse, the fact that the VCR works
one day doesn't mean that it will keep working.
</P>
<P>
   ``On New Year's Day we may have problems with the switch over,''
said Larry Shafer, founder of Y2Kbase, a database where consumers
can check to see if products are Y2K-compliant. ``But at other
times the date calculations might be accurate, even if the VCR
thinks it is 1900.''
</P>
<P>
   The concerns are sparked by the Y2K bug _ the computer glitch
that may incapacitate some software and computers.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a programming technique used years ago, some software
views years in a two-digit format, such as ``99'' for 1999. The
two-digit representation of 2000 will be ``00,'' which many
computers could interpret as 1900, creating the potential for
problems for date-sensitive hardware and software.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers are clearly starting to wonder what will work and what
won't.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site had 50,000 visitors during the first four weeks
that the Y2Kbase was up for consumers to check items to see if they
are Y2K-compliant.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, cars, computers and appliances top the list of
Y2K-compliance queries.
</P>
<P>
   Although consumers are concerned about whether their cars will
work in 2000, only 17 percent of the automobile companies in the
Y2Kbase.com database provide Y2K information on their public Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Just how many auto components will be affected is up for debate.
</P>
<P>
   Chevrolet has found that most systems have no date-related
functionality and were found to be Y2K-compliant.
</P>
<P>
   Computer hardware and software also raise consumer questions.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the electronics companies have no listing regarding
whether they are Y2K-compliant. But some, such as Sony Electronics,
report that most of its products will function when the date
changes from 1999 to 2000. The exception: CCDF30 cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the stereos won't be a problem,'' said Stuart
Schuster, president of Marvin Electronics Co. of Fort Worth.
``There's not a date clock on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like most of the TVs will be fine,'' Schuster said.
``Where we don't know is some of the older VCRs.''
</P>
<P>
   THe time shift function on pre-1988 VCR models might not
function, according to the Federal Trade Commission. But the fix
for VCRs is easy. Experts suggest setting the date to 1972, because
the 1972 calendar is identical to 2000's.
</P>
<P>
   Fixing an out-of-sync VCR probably won't be necessary, and even
if it's not working, it probably won't be worth fixing, said Matt
Gallandat, owner of A/V Electronics in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there will be a modification available or that
it would be worth modifying,'' he said. ``If you have a problem, I
don't see trying to make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   Four-head VCRs now cost around $100, so if a noncompliant one
could be fixed it's probably more practical to buy a new one,
experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Cameras, camcorders, digital wristwatches and pocket electronic
organizers containing calender chips might have Y2K problems,
according to the Federal Trade Commission. Some camcorders sold
before 1988 will display the date incorrectly but function
properly.
</P>
<P>
   Personal computers that are more than seven years old and use
Windows 95 could present problems for consumers. But the newer home
computers _ say, those sold since the advent of the Pentium chip _
shouldn't catch the Y2K bug, said John Henson, operations manager
for SPI Systems in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   A bigger problem, he said, will be the sort of outdated hardware
and customized, proprietary software packages common to businesses
such as accountants' and doctors' offices.

FOR TRUE AMERICAN BARBECUE THAT HAUNTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STEVEN RAICHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grilling may lie at the heart of the American summer, but
barbecue is its soul, for true barbecue possesses a personality and
depth of flavor you simply can't achieve with grilling.
</P>
<P>
   True barbecued Texas brisket, for example, or North Carolina
pulled pork relies on long, slow, smoky cooking, not just a short
sizzle over hot coals or gas flames. The result is the haunting
taste of wood smoke and meat so tender that you can pull it apart
with your fingers.
</P>
<P>
   True barbecue has about as much in common with a grilled burger
as prime rib does with minute steak.
</P>
<P>
   Barbecue achieves these virtues by using indirect cooking: the
meat is placed near, not directly over, the fire, and the
temperature is deliberately kept low. The traditional fuel is wood,
since smoke is the very essence of barbecue. Patience is essential,
as the larger cuts of meat can take as long as 16 hours to acquire
the proper dose of smoke and tenderness.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that true barbecue can be made on a backyard
grill, even one fueled by gas. It's certainly worth the effort, for
nothing adds flavor and succulence to meat like this traditional
American method.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, barbecue was cooked in or over a pit, and sometimes
it still is, particularly in the South. More often the ``pit'' is a
brick or steel construction above ground, decades old and blackened
with drippings and wood smoke. The fire burns at one end, and the
food is cooked at the other. Or the fire burns at the bottom of the
pit, while the food cooks on racks high above it.
</P>
<P>
   Given the formidable size of a traditional pit and the logs used
to fuel it, true barbecue may seem difficult to duplicate on a
backyard grill. On the contrary, today's kettle grills and gas
grills, with their high lids, make barbecuing a snap.
</P>
<P>
   As with a professional pit, the fire is built on opposite sides
of the grill, or on one side, and the food is cooked in the center,
or on the opposite side. The grill has to be covered, to seal in
the smoke flavor.
</P>
<P>
   How you approach true barbecue depends on your equipment. With a
charcoal kettle grill, you begin by lighting charcoal or charwood
(lump charcoal) in your chimney starter. When the coals glow red,
dump them into two piles at opposite sides of the grill. (Some
grills come with side baskets for this purpose.) Place a foil drip
pan in the center of the grill, between the mounds of embers. Place
the grate on the grill, and barbecue your food in the center, over
the drip pan. Toss a handful of wood chips on the coals to generate
smoke. Keep the grill covered, adjusting the vents to keep the
temperature at 325 to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   When barbecuing large cuts of meat, you'll need to replenish the
coals every hour. Add 10 coals to each side and leave the grill
uncovered for a few minutes to allow them to ignite. Charwood
ignites faster and more cleanly than briquettes, so I prefer it.
</P>
<P>
   It's available at natural-food stores and at many supermarkets,
or from Peoples Woods, a company specializing charwood and hardwood
fuel; (800) 729-5800.
</P>
<P>
   A gas grill is even simpler to use, for the temperature remains
more consistent. If you have one with two burners, light one side
(set the burner on high), and cook the food on the other. If you
have three burners, light the front and rear burners (or left and
right ones), and cook the food in the middle. If you have four
burners, light the far left and far right burners, and cook the
food in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge of barbecuing with gas lies in generating
sufficient wood smoke. Many gas grills have special smoker boxes in
which you can add chips, but some work better than others.
</P>
<P>
   Now, here's the tricky part. If a handful of chips in the smoker
box fails to produce enough smoke, you may need to add all of the
wood chips at once and run your grill on high until you see smoke.
If your grill lacks a smoker box (or if the one provided doesn't
work well), loosely wrap the chips in heavy-duty foil, poke a few
holes in the top with a fork, and place it under the grate,
directly over one of the burners.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what type of grill you use, there are two obvious
choices of meat: pork and beef. Chicken is another good option,
especially a whole bird, which cannot be cooked by traditional
grilling.
</P>
<P>
   For me, barbecue starts with a rub, a vibrant mixture of spices
used to coat and flavor the meat before cooking. A good rub will
have the ability to enhance the flavor of the meat without
camouflaging or overpowering it. The rub here does just that,
although it contains only four ingredients: salt, sugar, pepper and
paprika.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, barbecue means pork, in particular a Boston
butt (cut from the pork shoulder) that's been smoked to
fall-off-the-bone tender, and then pulled into shreds or chopped.
The traditional condiment is vinegar sauce, which is mixed right in
with the meat.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, barbecue means beef, especially brisket. This is more
challenging to cook than pork shoulder, for brisket is a tough,
ornery cut with an inherent tendency to dry out. To prevent this, I
choose brisket with a thick layer of fat on top and cook it in a
foil pan, which protects the meat on the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is for sure: No one will ever mistake this barbecue
for grilling.
</P>
<P>
   NORTH CAROLINA-STYLE PULLED PORK &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 5 to 7 hours
</P>
<P>
   1 bone-in pork shoulder roast, 5 to 6 pounds
</P>
<P>
   \ cup basic rub (see recipe)
</P>
<P>
   4 cups hickory chips, soaked in cold water for 1 hour and then
drained For the vinegar sauce:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1{ cups cider vinegar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons sugar, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon hot pepper flakes
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons salt, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon freshly ground black pepper.
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat grill to 325 degrees, building fire on opposite sides
of grill if using charcoal, or on one side or opposite sides if
using gas. Season pork with rub.
</P>
<P>
   2. If using charcoal, add fresh coals and toss { cup wood chips
on each mound of coals every hour for first 4 hours. If using gas,
place wood chips in smoker box, and preheat until you see smoke
(depending on model of gas grill, use all 4 cups at once or 1 cup
every hour for first 4 hours).
</P>
<P>
   3. Place pork, fat side up, on grill over drip pan, away from
fire. Barbecue until nicely browned and cooked through, for 4 to 6
hours, or until internal temperature is 195 degrees, so that meat
will shred properly.
</P>
<P>
   4. Meanwhile, combine ingredients for vinegar sauce in a bowl
with { cup water, and whisk to mix. Add additional salt or sugar to
taste, if desired.
</P>
<P>
   5. Transfer cooked pork to cutting board, cover with foil, and
let rest until cool enough to handle, about 15 minutes. Pull meat
into pieces, discarding any skin, bones or fat. With fingers or
fork, pull each pork piece into shreds about 2 inches long and \
inch wide. (Or finely chop with cleaver.) Transfer to metal or foil
pan; stir in 1 cup vinegar sauce, or enough to keep meat moist and
flavorful. Cover with foil; place on grill to keep warm until
serving. Serve on hamburger buns with remaining sauce on side.

<P>
   2. If using charcoal, add fresh coals and toss { cup wood chips
on each mound of coals every hour for first 4 hours. If using gas,
place wood chips in smoker box, and preheat until you see smoke
(depending on model of gas grill, use all 4 cups at once or 1 cup
every hour for first 4 hours).
</P>
<P>
   3. Place brisket, fat side up, in foil roasting pan just large
enough to hold it. Place pan in center of grill, away from heat.
</P>
<P>
   4. Barbecue brisket until nicely browned, cooked through and
very tender, for 5 to 7 hours. If brisket starts to brown too much,
tent it loosely with foil.
</P>
<P>
   5. Transfer cooked brisket to cutting board, cover with foil,
and let rest for 10 minutes, reserving pan juices. With sharp
knife, trim and discard any large lumps of fat. Slice brisket
thinly across grain. Serve with slices of white bread, spooning pan

   Benziger Pinot Noir 1996, California. About $18.
</P>
<P>
   Appellations can be misleading. With some wines, the California
appellation _as opposed to a Napa or Sonoma County appellation, for
example _ implies that grapes from lesser-growing regions were used
in the blend. Not in this instance. This pinot was made from 16
lots of grapes from five of the finest vineyards in the state,
stretching from the Bien Nacido Ranch in the south-central region
to the Kent and Preston vineyards in the Russian River area in
Sonoma County. Each lot was vinified and aged separately, then
blended. The alcohol content, 14.1 percent, is high for a pinot
noir but the wine has more than enough fruit to balance it out. It
could probably benefit from another year in the bottle.

<P>
   Open a box of frilly little leaves of baby cilantro, and a clean
fresh aroma wafts out. It is not at all like the smell of mature
cilantro, which can seem musty, especially to those who don't like
it. Like other micro greens, baby cilantro is much subtler than the
grown-up version. It also has a touch of pepperiness and a bit of
grassiness lacking in its older siblings.
</P>
<P>
   Baby cilantro is the latest entrant in the great New York
restaurant race to distinguish one chef's cooking from another's
with esoteric ingredients like micro greens. Such minuscule leaves
are already becoming old hat, as chefs seek out the unusual micro
herb no one has seen before. And right now, it's this baby, also
known as coriander or Chinese parsley.
</P>
<P>
   I first encountered baby cilantro at the Indian-accented
restaurant Tabla. Jean-Georges Vongerichten is using it in spring
rolls at Vong, and Wayne Nish sprinkles it over lobster in a sauce
based on Muscat Beaumes-de-Venise at March.
</P>
<P>
   It's perfect ``for people who don't like the hard-core cilantro
flavor,'' said Daniel DelVecchio, the cuisine and design developer
for Vongerichten, who uses it to garnish the spring rolls, filled
with peeky-toe crab, chilies, mayonnaise and tamarind.
</P>
<P>
   Nish said he liked to use it ``in places where fully grown
cilantro would overwhelm everything else.'' For a flavor as
delicate as lobster's, he said, ``it adds a spike of brightness.''
</P>
<P>
   March serves the lobster with polenta studded with bits of
lobster, topped with finely cut vegetables and ground dried lobster
roe. For home cooks, the lobster with the Beaumes-de-Venise sauce
is enough of a treat to garnish with baby cilantro.
</P>
<P>
   The infant herb is available by mail from Indian Rock Produce in
Quakertown, Pa.; (800) 882-0512. It costs $40 a pound, but as
little as a quarter pound can be purchased, for $10 plus shipping.
And who knows? Later this spring, it may turn up at some of New
York's Greenmarkets.
</P>
<P>
   To grow it yourself, take this advice from Margaret Falk, the
plant records manager at the New York Botanical Garden in the
Bronx. Scatter seeds in potting soil in a flat, and cover lightly
with the soil. Put the flat in a shady spot. Keep it out of the hot
sun, since cilantro prefers cool weather. You can also try growing
cilantro indoors under grow lights, placing the lights five or six
inches above the seed flats. Pick the leaves when the plants are an
inch high.

   PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND LOBSTER WITH MUSCAT BEAUMES-DE-VENISE SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from Wayne Nish, March
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour 50 minutes
</P>
<P>
   1 large bottle Muscat Beaumes-de-Venise (750 milliliters)
</P>
<P>
   1 5-inch piece thinly sliced ginger
</P>
<P>
   5 shallots, halved
</P>
<P>
   5 cloves garlic, halved
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon ground cumin
</P>
<P>
   1 quart plus 2 tablespoons heavy cream (40 percent, if possible)
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sea salt, plus extra to season
</P>
<P>
   Juice of { lime, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   3 lobsters, 1\ to 1{ pounds each
</P>
<P>
   { pound (2 sticks) unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons baby cilantro leaves. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. For the sauce, combine Beaumes-de-Venise, ginger, shallots
and garlic, and cook to reduce to 1 cup. Whisk in cumin and 1 quart
cream; return to heat, and reduce to 3 cups. Remove from heat, and
strain to remove solids. Season with salt and lime juice to taste,
and keep warm. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2. In large stockpot, combine 3 quarts water with { cup sea
salt. Place over high heat, and bring to a boil. Meanwhile, fill a
large bowl with 3 quarts water and ice, and add { cup sea salt. Set
aside. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3. Kill each lobster by placing the tip of sharp knife on top of
the head behind the eyes and striking it down with a kitchen
mallet. Twist off the tails, and break off the claws (with
knuckles) at the bodies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4. Add claws to pot. After 4 minutes, add tails, and continue to
boil 6 minutes longer. Using tongs or slotted spoon, transfer claws
and tails to ice water to stop the cooking. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   5. Remove meat from shells, and cut meat into bite-size pieces.
Set aside. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   6. In a small saucepan over low heat, melt butter. Add remaining
cream, and mix well. Season with sea salt to taste. Bring to a bare
simmer, and then add lobster to heat through. To serve, remove
lobster from butter-cream mixture, and place an equal portion of
lobster on each of four plates. Spoon Beaumes-de-Venise sauce
around, and garnish with baby cilantro. &QL;

ARLINGTON, Texas: doctors' offices. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At home and at work, digital thermostats should not be affected
by the new year if they are programmed based on the days of the
week, not the year.
</P>
<P>
   But monitored security systems with a calendar function might
run into problems with the Y2K bug. Even if the unit is
Y2K-compliant, it could malfunction if the monitoring company's
systems are noncompliant, according to the Federal Trade
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Malfunctions of appliances and electronics might be annoying to
consumers, but if the banking system is not Y2K-compliant, minor
annoyances could turn into major headaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could impact things like employers' payroll processing and
insurance companies' ability to handle claims,'' Shafer said.
``Those large systems are of more concern than products people have
around their home.''
</P>
<P>
   Away from home, computerized systems such as ATMs, gasoline
pumps and credit cards could cause a consumer crisis.
</P>
<P>
   According to Exxon Co. USA, ``...the corporation could
potentially experience disruptions to some mission critical
operations or deliveries to customers as a result of year 2000
issues, particularly in the first few weeks of the year 2000. ...
The potential financial impact or liability associated with such
disruptions cannot be reasonably estimated.''
</P>
<P>
   So, even though Exxon will spend as much as $250 million in
compliance efforts, the company isn't absolutely sure that there
won't be glitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely a good chance credit cards could have
problems,'' said Brent Rogers, director of information technology
at Vought Heritage Federal Credit Union in Grand Prairie.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about Y2K-related scams have led the FTC to warn
consumers to be aware of suspicious phone calls during which people
are asked to disclose their credit card and bank account numbers.
The callers claim that the numbers are needed to deal with the year
2000 problem.
</P>
<P>
   Also of concern is an anticipated year-end rush to withdraw cash
from financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want people to pull out their money because they
could be endangering themselves,'' said Quay Lutrell, vice
president of marketing at Vought Heritage Federal Credit Union.
``People are definitely going to be potential targets if someone
sees them walking out with a thick lump in their pocket and they
may follow them home.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial experts suggest withdrawing enough cash for two weeks
and no more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We strongly recommend people get traveler's checks rather than
cash,'' Lutrell said. ``And they should remember that if they leave
it in their financial institutions, it is insured, but if it's in
between the mattresses, it is not insured.''
</P>
<P>
   It could be days, weeks even months before consumers see the
effects of incorrect data resulting from the Y2K bug.
</P>
<P>
   Some systems might run into problems on Feb. 29, 2000, because
computers could forget about the leap year, Anderson said. Problems
could arise if computers disagree on what day it is.
</P>
<P>
   If software is not programmed for leap year, March 3, 2000, is
the first Friday when computers will think it is Saturday. School
bells might fail to ring, and bank vaults might not open.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is, it won't hurt to be prepared, Anderson said.
If the alarm doesn't work it's not that much of a problem, she
said. But if the alarm, microwave, thermostat, gas pump and ATM
don't work, it all adds up.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have a lot of things unfolding, our ability to handle
them is compromised,'' she said. ``People need to decide what kind
of impact Y2K will have if stuff doesn't work.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For wine enthusiasts, the opening of a winery is exciting news,
especially if it's in the Napa Valley and it plans to make only
about 500 cases a year. It's the same in Europe: the biggest buzz
invariably is about the people who make the least amount of wine,
which often is the most expensive.
</P>
<P>
   But these wines are not necessarily to everyone's taste, or
budget. Every year around this time, Market Watch, a trade
publication based in New York, releases a report on what it calls
``hot brands,'' individual wines and lines of wines whose sales
performance was particularly outstanding in the last calendar year.
These are the wines that millions of Americans buy not for snob
appeal or investment potential, but because they enjoy drinking
them.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprising, Chateau Petrus from Bordeaux, which makes only
about 3,000 cases a year, and the Grace Family Vineyards in
California, which makes a mere 300 cases, are not on this list. But
E.&AMP;J. Gallo is; it makes about 75 million cases a year. So is
Sebastiani Vineyards and some companies that are probably unknown
to drinkers of premium wines, like the Wine Group, which makes
Corbett Canyon wines, and Southcorp Wines of Australia, best known
for its Lindemans label.
</P>
<P>
   The hot brands are not necessarily the biggest sellers; rather,
they are the wines that showed the biggest jumps in sales volume
from one year to the next. What makes them important is what they
tell us about wine drinking in America now and the direction in
which it is headed. And that direction is toward well-made varietal
wines _ chardonnays, merlots, cabernets _ and away from generics
like domestic burgundy.
</P>
<P>
   The hottest domestic brand in 1998, according to Market Watch,
was Vendange from Sebastiani Vineyards in Sonoma, Calif. Vendange
makes several varietal wines, and their sales jumped from 3.8
million cases in 1997 to 4.4 million last year, an increase of
almost 15 percent. Second was Turning Leaf from Gallo, up 19
percent to a bit more than 3 million cases.
</P>
<P>
   Gallo had three other brands in the top 15: Gossamer Bay, 5th,
with 1.75 million cases, a 25 percent increase; Copperidge, 6th,
with 1.7 million cases, up 13 percent, and Gallo Sonoma, 15th,
225,000 cases, also up 25 percent. Sebastiani also took 7th and
13th place with its Nathanson Creek and Talus brands.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the top 15 were Kendall-Jackson, 3rd; Corbett
Canyon, 4th; Clos du Bois, 8th; Meridian, 9th; Beaulieu Vineyard,
10th; Robert Mondavi Coastal, 11th; Forest Glen, 12th, and
Forestville Vineyards, 14th.
</P>
<P>
   Other imported hot brands, in addition to Lindemans, were
Rosemount Estates of Australia; three Chilean wines _ Walnut Crest,
Vina Carolina and Caliterra _ and the only brand from Europe, Ecco
Domani. Caliterra is actually a Robert Mondavi wine and Ecco
Domani, a Gallo Italian import.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the biggest selling wine brand in the United
States in 1998 was Franzia, made by the Wine Group, which sold 19
million cases in the bag-in-a box format. But it showed only about
a 6 percent growth rate, so it did not make the hot brands list.
Similarly, Banfi Vintners Reunite brand was the largest-selling
imported wine in this country, but its growth rate did not qualify
it for the list.
</P>
<P>
   What distinguishes this year's hot brands is the fact that they
are almost all varietal wines, which is a wine named for the
particular grape from which it is principally made. Some are made
to appeal to specific age and income groups but their producers
appear to share a common conviction: that Americans who drink wine,
whatever their age, income or level of sophistication, are no
longer satisfied with what used to be known as jug wines.
</P>
<P>
   The figures bear this out. In 1990, the California wine industry
shipped 65 million cases of generic wines and 44 million cases of
varietals. In 1997, the last year for which these figures are
available, the industry shipped 52 million cases of generics and 82
million cases of varietals. In 1985, varietals accounted for 14
percent of California wine shipments; in 1997, they accounted for
61 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Chardonnay remains the most popular of all grape varieties. It
regularly outsells almost all the other varietal wines combined.
Cabernet sauvignon continues to be the leading red grape variety,
with merlot, zinfandel and pinot noir, in that order, following
well behind.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular of all varietal wines after chardonnay is white
zinfandel, which is neither white nor, in many cases, entirely
zinfandel. Sweet and slightly carbonated, white zinfandel is more
of a specialty drink than a wine but its devoted fans insist that
it goes well with many kinds of food. Its popularity is
astonishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appeals to so many people because it resembles what they
grew up drinking, fruit juices and colas,'' said Stanley Hock, a
spokesman for Sutter Home Winery, which claims to have invented the
pink wine and makes and ships 4 million cases of it a year.
</P>
<P>
   While sophisticated wine drinkers may dismiss these popular
wines as irrelevant to their life styles, they do so at their
peril. The production of truly fine wines will always be limited.
In many of the fine wine districts of France, Italy and the Napa
Valley, there is no space left for expansion. But the demand for
better wines continues to grow; many of the world's best wines are
already sold on allocation.
</P>
<P>
   Most hot brands are in the $6 to $10 range, but as more
consumers learn to like varietal wines, the pressure on prices will
steadily increase. Connoisseurs may not be happy, but their
grumbling is all but drowned out by the wine industry cheering:
``Let's hear it for the hot brands.''

PARSLEY FOUND GUILTY IN SHIGELLOSIS OUTBREAKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn., Calif., Mass., Fla., Canada)  (mk) 
 By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Parsley very often is a garnish that is left on the plate. Which
makes the discovery that parsley was responsible for seven
outbreaks of shigellosis, a food-borne illness, last summer all the
more remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parsley is one of those things you hardly ever ask about,''
said Dr. Robert Tauxe, the chief of the food-borne and diarrheal
diseases branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
in Atlanta. But scientists were able to link the outbreaks by using
Pulsenet, a sophisticated detection system that enables them to
fingerprint the DNA of bacteria. They can then compare the
fingerprints to see if the bacteria are from a common source. In
this case, they were able to then trace the parsley to a farm in
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at the Minnesota Department of Health used Pulsenet
to track the shigella bacteria that caused two of the outbreaks of
shigellosis, which occurred in the state. From there, the system
helped link the parsley to outbreaks in California, Massachusetts
and Florida, and Ontario and Alberta in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The 493 confirmed and likely cases of shigellosis in this
instance were traced to restaurant foods, including chicken
sandwiches and pasta dishes, garnished with parsley.
</P>
<P>
   Shigellosis, which occurs within 12 to 24 hours and lasts three
to five days, causes fever, serious abdominal cramps, nausea and
diarrhea. In the past it has been easily treated with antibiotics,
but this strain from Mexico was more antibiotic-resistant and
required additional treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Some forms of shigella, generally found in developing countries,
can cause dysentery, which may lead to kidney failure and death.
</P>
<P>
   Between 15,000 and 20,000 cases of shigellosis are diagnosed
each year in the United States, but the Centers for Disease Control
say that like all food- borne infections, many more go undiagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   Shigella lives in human feces and usually is passed from person
to person when carriers do not wash their hands. But scientists
believe this parsley was first contaminated at the farm right after
it was harvested, when it was kept in water that had not been
chlorinated.
</P>
<P>
   And the way the parsley was handled at the restaurants was a
contributing factor. It was chopped and left at room temperature
instead of being refrigerated. Chopping releases nutrients that
feed the bacteria, but refrigeration lowers the level of the
bacteria. Parsley can be chopped in advance, after washing under
cold running water. But chopped or whole, it should be refrigerated
at all times.

CORRUPTION AT CUSTOMS CITED IN SENATE TESTIMONY 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Stands for INS-ABUSE)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Allegations of wrongdoing by U.S. Customs Service
officers tripled from 1996 to 1998, according to a Senate analysis
released Tuesday that ranked Miami and the Texas cities of El Paso
and McAllen as the top three sites for complaints nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis by the Senate Finance Committee agrees with a
Treasury Department inspector general's investigation and outside
audits that there was no ``systemic corruption'' within the agency.
</P>
<P>
   But the frequency and number of allegations _ which include
bribery and drug smuggling _ make clear ``that strong external
oversight'' is needed for the troubled agency, said Sen. William
Roth Jr., R-Del., the committee chairman who held the last of three
oversight hearings on Customs on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis found the most common accusation against Customs
officers from 1996 to 1998 was bribery, which amounted to 8.6
percent of all complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Sexual harassment and misconduct made up 7.2 percent of the
complaints followed by disclosure of confidential information, 5.8
percent; assault, 4.5 percent; drug trafficking, 3.9 percent; and
threats, 3.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Miami was the Customs office against which the most allegations
_ 11 percent _ were made, followed by El Paso and McAllen, with 9
percent each.
</P>
<P>
   However, the analysis did not elaborate on the nature of the
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Other cities were: Tucson, Ariz., 6 percent; Los Angeles and San
Francisco, 5 percent each; San Diego, 4 percent; Customs
headquarters in Washington and the Houston office, 3 percent each.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, accusations of criminal wrongdoing and misconduct more
than tripled to 677 in 1998 from 209 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The committee asked former New York state Judge Milton Mollen,
who headed the Mollen Commission that investigated corruption
within the New York Police Department between 1992 and 1994, to
review complaints against Customs.
</P>
<P>
   Mollen said Customs officers reflect society; some are dedicated
and honorable while some are weak and vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Others are just plain venal, who view public service as a
means of using their power to illegally enrich themselves,'' Mollen
said, urging the panel to create an outside monitor to work with
Customs to confront corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Customs Commissioner Raymond Kelly has implemented procedures to
better address the complaints and has hired William Keefer, a
former Justice Department official and federal prosecutor, to steer
the agency's internal affairs operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Misconduct by Customs employees will not be tolerated under my
watch,'' Kelly told the panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want everyone to understand the rules as well as the
consequences of any illegal or improper activities,'' Keefer said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Tarr, an assistant inspector general with the Treasury
Department, said their review of Customs complaints found that
internal affairs investigators failed to follow all leads and
lacked supervisory review.
</P>
<P>
   When misconduct was substantiated, ``disciplinary penalties were
inconsistently applied,'' Tarr said, and that created a fear of
reprisal among officers and employees filing complaints against
other officers.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Parolisi, a former New York police internal affairs
officer, was hired by Customs on May 9 to help clean up the agency.
</P>
<P>
   He told the Senate panel, ``The most formidable corruption
threat facing Customs is the illegal drug trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Parolisi also said Customs reviews found that internal affairs
``is more reactionary than proactive in detecting and combating
corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   Customs has implemented new recruitment and training practices,
and has outlined new guidelines on disciplinary actions.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is working with the Immigration and Naturalization
Service to provide more supervision and control of agents working
at land ports of entry along the U.S.-Mexico border. The INS is a
Justice Department agency and Customs is part of the Treasury
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Allegations against inspectors accounted for 29 percent of all
cases, and criminal investigators were targets of 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Internal affairs officers referred only 53 percent of the
allegations to Customs management for review. Of those, 29 percent
of the cases reviewed by management resulted in no action, while 71
percent resulted in some sort of sanction.

WHAT'S HOT IN BACKYARDS: GRILLED SPICY SHRIMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: recipe at end of article)  
 (bl)  
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For all the pleasures of slow smoking on a grill, speed is why
we usually most value a grill in the backyard. I constantly get
requests for a simple but unusual, fast-cooking, great-tasting
recipe for the grill, and I always recommend spicy shrimp.
</P>
<P>
   The seasonings I use are common _ garlic, lemon, olive oil,
cayenne, paprika and salt _ but that combination produces a huge
impact on the shrimp flavor. I keep the cayenne to a minimum,
because good paprika has some heat. The red of the paprika makes
the dish look hotter than it really is, giving it a certain macho
appeal. To me, the flavor is best intense but not fiery. But you
can make it incendiary if you like.
</P>
<P>
   The key is fresh paprika, not that tin you inherited from your
mother. After you buy it, taste it; if it is hot, use half a
teaspoon.
</P>
<P>
   I created the spicy paste for this dish as a marinade to hasten
the thawing of frozen shrimp, but now I rely on it whether there is
time to marinate or not. You can let the shrimp sit in it for
hours. In fact, I like to dump both shrimp and paste in a covered
plastic container, shake them together to coat the shrimp, then
carry the container to a party and grill the shrimp there. Or just
mix the two together right before cooking.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have a grill, the recipe also works broiled. Or you
might try it in a hot, dry pan on top of the stove, but that will
cause smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all shrimp are frozen before they are sold, so you don't
sacrifice quality by buying frozen shrimp and thawing them
yourself. They may even be better.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to peel the shrimp before cooking them either,
but I think the paste has more impact if you do, and you also
perform a kindness for your guests. I don't even bother to devein
the shrimp, because I doubt one person in 10 can tell the
difference once they are cooked.

   WASHINGTON, May 25-- A Pennsylvania teen beat out 45 others and
will advance to the final rounds of this year's National Geography
Bee for a chance to win a college scholarship and trip to
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Raji Shankar, 14, of Havertown, Pa., and nine others from states
or U.S. territories, will be quizzed Wednesday by Jeopardy! game
show host Alex Trebek. ``I read a lot,'' Shankar said. ``I am
fortunate to have parents who allowed me to travel. They didn't
make me study this or anything, I was just good at it and it took
off from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Shankar, an eighth grader at Haverford Middle School, will be
tested for her ability to locate places on maps, define geological
terms, and identify countries by a photograph, description of the
culture or an historical event.
</P>
<P>
   With poise and enthusiasm, Shankar prevailed in eight of ten
rounds of questions Tuesday. She gave the correct answers to
questions about which country lies farther north, Chad or Botswana,
(Chad), and which Japanese island is linked to Shikoku by the
world's longest suspension bridge that spans the Inland Sea.
(Honshu).
</P>
<P>
   Shankar, who represented the state last year, but did not make
it to the final rounds, said she prepared for the contest by
studying the World Atlas for a half-hour every night and reading
international news stories.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Raja Kumari, said her daughter is ``world-minded''
because she has visited a grandmother in India, and vacationed in
places like Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Shankar said she enjoys reading and traveling. She said she
would most like to visit the Yucatan Peninsula to see the Maya
ruins.
</P>
<P>
   The National Geographic Society, which sponsors the contest is
offering the $25,000 scholarship and Bank One Corp., is providing
the winner with a week-long trip to Australia.
</P>
<P>
   In the final round of the contest Shankar and teens from New
York, Maine, Michigan, Missouri, North Dakota, Puerto Rico,
Tennessee, Washington, Mississippi and South Carolina, will be
eliminated as soon as they answer two questions incorrectly.

SENATE PROVISION COULD SHORT-CIRCUIT INTERNET LIQUOR SALES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CARL HULSE   
 New York Times Regional Newspapers   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The provision doesn't even mention the Internet and
it amends an arcane beverage law crafted well before World War I.
</P>
<P>
   But the stilted language on ``intoxicating liquor'' that was
slipped into a juvenile crime bill is at the center of a 21st
Century congressional fight over the future of e-commerce and sales
of wine and spirits via the Web.
</P>
<P>
   America's vintners and their allies in the world of cyberspace
say a newly adopted Senate proposal that would allow disputes over
interstate alcohol shipments to be aired in federal court is an
assault on computer shopping masquerading as a crackdown on
underage drinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill does nothing to stop kids from getting alcohol,''
said Rep. Mike Thompson, D-Calif., co-chair of the congressional
Wine Caucus. ``It does a lot to slow down the effort that a lot of
states are making to solve the problem of a distribution system for
small wineries.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the measure argue it is nothing more than a
well-aimed effort to reduce underage drinking and resolve some
confusion over the ability of states to enforce laws already on the
books regarding liquor shipments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only ones who need fear this are those who are conducting
their business in an unlawful manner, particularly those who are
willing to sell alcohol to our children,'' thundered Sen. Robert
Byrd, D-W.V., as he persuaded the Senate to accept his approach.
</P>
<P>
   The high-stakes, increasingly high-decibel fight pits liquor
wholesalers trying to maintain their hold on distribution against
winemakers trying to reach new markets. It matches anti-alcohol
forces against boosters of the Internet. It contrasts the days of
Prohibition with the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the issue had been debated mainly at the state
level as some state legislatures sought to close their borders to
liquor shipments by making such transactions a felony. Elsewhere,
state officials have negotiated direct shipment programs with the
wine industry.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute only smoldered on Capitol Hill as the subject of
public hearings and private negotiations toward a compromise. But
it burst into the open last week when Byrd attached his proposal to
the high-profile juvenile justice bill on a surprisingly lopsided
80-17 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., a wine industry ally, added her
own amendment, one she portrayed as a more direct attempt to curb
underage drinking. Her measure requires shipments be marked as
alcohol with recipients forced to show proof of age.
</P>
<P>
   Now the issue moves to the House, where the legislative dynamic
is quite different. California has 52 representatives there and
many are friendly to the wine industry, including key members of
the Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over much of the
juvenile crime bill.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson and Wine Caucus co-chairman George Radanovich,
R-Calif., a small winemaker, already circulated a letter objecting
to the Byrd plan to Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the panel,
as well as other congressional leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the provision say it is moving rapidly because a main
trade association backing the law, the Wine and Spirits Wholesalers
of America, has hired lobbyists who are former staffers to the two
main Senate proponents _ Byrd and Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. As
Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, Hatch first proposed the
crackdown and held a hearing on the issue in March.
</P>
<P>
   But officials at the wholesalers group said a Utah court case
over beer shipments grabbed Hatch's attention before the lobbyists
were brought on board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically this is a back-home issue for Hatch,'' said David
Dickerson, a spokesman for the group. ``His own state is having
trouble enforcing the law.''
</P>
<P>
   The wine industry has not been reluctant to call in big guns of
its own. Among the opponents it has enlisted to the shipping
measure is the Association for Interactive Media. The large
Internet association has more than 300 influential corporate
members such as Yahoo!, Citibank and The New York Times. The group
says it fears the legislation could stifle the growth of Internet
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The wine industry has also shown its willingness to play
hardball on the issue. On the Senate floor, Feinstein sprung the
news that Mothers Against Drunk Driving was no longer backing the
push for the Byrd measure, saying the dispute was one between
competing elements of the liquor industry.
</P>
<P>
   And the wine lobby has taken aim at the advocacy group Americans
for Responsible Alcohol Access, an organization the Wine Institute
calls a ``front'' for the wholesalers. The group has helped
television stations around the nation conduct audience-grabbing
``stings'' that show teen-agers buying spirits over the Internet.
The wine industry says those transactions could not have happened
without adult involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Barry McCahill, executive director of the group, says it is no
secret that the 2-year-old organization is funded by the liquor
wholesalers. But he said that on the direct sales issue, the
interests of the alcohol distributors and the anti-youth drinking
community coincide.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are trying to change the subject and make it about me and
the industry,'' he said of the wine lobby. ``The fact of the matter
is, these guys are shipping alcohol illegally and that has been
documented time and time again.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What does a four-star chef do before making a big
decision about his restaurant, his personal life, his career goals?
</P>
<P>
   He jots some hash marks on a piece of paper and asks a
42-year-old Frenchman named Jerome Brasset to tell him what to do.
Hire a new sous-chef, say, or open a franchise in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Brasset says he can divine the future through an obscure occult
practice known as geomancy. The bizarre thing is that many of New
York's finest French chefs believe him.
</P>
<P>
   At least a dozen of them are into it, including Daniel Boulud,
Francois Payard, Jean-Louis Palladin and Eric Ripert, plus many of
their partners, wives and kitchen lieutenants. Echoing the words of
his fellow devotees, Jean-Georges Vongerichten said, ``I don't make
a move without him.''
</P>
<P>
   Other chefs think it's the nuttiest thing they've ever heard.
Christian Delouvrier, of Lespinasse, merely started laughing: ``I
don't believe it! Those guys go to a fortune teller? Ha ha ha.''
</P>
<P>
   But to Vongerichten, Brasset is no laughing matter. He has been
consulting him closely on his plans to open a boutique hotel and a
restaurant (his 10th) downtown. ``I would have walked away from the
Mercer Kitchen deal if it weren't for Jerome,'' Vongerichten said.
``I never would have opened Prime in Las Vegas or Vong in Chicago
if Jerome hadn't given me the clear-sailing sign.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Ripert, the chef and co-owner of Le Bernardin, was
informed by Brasset that a key employee would be leaving soon. Sure
enough, the chef at Ripert's Atlanta restaurant quit. Jean-Yves
Schillinger was having trouble with the liquor license when he
opened Destinee a year and a half ago. Brasset said the license
would go through in a month. It did. Boulud, of Daniel and Cafe
Boulud, goes so far as to call Brasset a ``supervoyant.''
</P>
<P>
   They met through Daniel's maitre d' hotel, Bruno Jamais, who has
also introduced Brasset to other members of what Jamais called
``the French mafia connection.'' Among them are Boulud's former
pastry chef, Payard, now the co-owner of his own eponymous
patisserie. ``I don't sign a deal before I ask his advice,'' Payard
said.
</P>
<P>
   Brasset's influence extends all the way up to Alain Ducasse,
whose six Michelin stars (for two restaurants) make him something
of a culinary godfather to this generation of ambitious,
entrepreneurial French chefs. Ducasse, coy about his friendship
with Brasset, does not deny there is one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying yes and I'm not saying no,'' he said, through a
spokesman, when asked if he had used him professionally. ``But I
have a lot of friends who have consulted him who have been
astonished by his performance.''
</P>
<P>
   The performance takes place during Brasset's readings. At $325
each, these private 90-minute sessions purport to draw on an
ancient form of fortunetelling dating from the early Egyptians.
Originally, the subject of the reading would draw lines in the
sand, or dirt, and the geomancer would ``read'' them, barefoot so
as to be in closer contact with the earth's forces.
</P>
<P>
   In Brasset's updated version, clients draw a random number of
hash marks on paper across 16 numbered lines. Brasset counts the
marks, runs them through his geomantic formulas, then offers his
advice.
</P>
<P>
   For customers unable to arrange or afford a tete-a-tete, Brasset
has a Web site, www.geomancyonline.com, programmed to answer all
questions (in sometimes broken English). A few months ago,
Vongerichten thought he had found his dream apartment. He logged on
and asked if he should buy. The answer came back: ``Categorically
not.'' He withdrew the bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is Cartesian,'' Brasset said of his system, on the phone
from his vacation house on the Spanish island of Ibiza. ``Precise,
accurate and mathematically elegant.'' The $325 fee (or as little
as $25 on line) is, he maintained, ``not expensive, because if you
want to know, `Should I open a restaurant?' it is many millions of
dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics, of course, disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has no basis in fact, like any divining,'' said James
Randi, president of the James Randi Educational Foundation, which
is devoted to debunking paranormal claims. ``Getting to know
unknown knowledge _ it's been tested endlessly, and it just doesn't
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Randi, a former illusionist known as the Amazing Randi,
dismissed geomancy as yet another form of ``gobbledygook,''
``flimflam,'' ``fantasy talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Other New York chefs were shocked to hear that some of their
most eminent colleagues were in a psychic's thrall.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Palmer, the owner of Aureole, could barely contain his
amusement. ``I'm going to get Dionne Warwick down here,'' he said,
aluding to the singer and ``Psychic Hotline'' host. ``Maybe she
could help me pick some new fabrics.''
</P>
<P>
   But no amount of scoffing seems to penetrate Brasset's Delphic
cool. ``I am never wrong,'' he said, offering, by way of example,
his warning to clients of last July's stock market mini-crash. Much
of his clientele _ businessmen, politicians, movie stars, chefs,
the rich _ seek his market wisdom. Shouldn't he play and get rich,
too?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not my job,'' he said. ``I have enough. I have one mouth,
no more.''
</P>
<P>
   One he evidently enjoys feeding well. ``He's a big foodie,''
Vongerichten said. Ariane Daguin, whose company, D'Artagnan,
supplies fois gras and high-end game to many of New York's best
restaurants, said she saw Brasset at Palladin with Ducasse during
last month's James Beard Awards. She assumed he was some kind of
``foodie parasite,'' until her reading, at the bar of Jean Georges.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy told me things from my past that nobody knows,'' she
said. ``He totally described my daughter's father.'' Another
convert. ``I don't regret my 300 bucks for one second,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone becomes an instant disciple. Sue Huffman, the
director of marketing at the French Culinary Institute, said she
``wasn't shaken'' by her reading. Brasset said he saw her ``working
with foreigners,'' a safe bet, given her job. ``Well, yeah, there's
a lot of French people down here,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And yet Ms. Huffman spoke glowingly about the handsome
Frenchman's charisma. ``He's absolutely charming,'' she said. ``You
kind of have to tear yourself away, because you feel like you could
talk to him for hours.''
</P>
<P>
   A valuable quality, apparently. His Web site lists his New York
address as the Pierre, where he stays every other month. Brasset
said he has about 2,000 clients. That's a lot of hash marks.
</P>
<P>
   In ancient Greece, Archimedes is said to have used geomancy to
foresee the outcome of battles. In the Islamic world, it remains a
common form of fortunetelling. But its last heyday in Western
civilization was the Renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   Princes needed to know whether it was a good time to invade a
neighboring city-state. The emerging mercantile class had questions
about frankincense futures. Then, as now, it was used by men with
their minds on their money and their money on their minds.
</P>
<P>
   John M. Greer, author of ``Earth Divination, Earth Magic: A
Practical Guide to Geomancy,'' to be published by Llewellyn in
July, said geomancy was ``traditionally very good for business
decisions and practical things.''
</P>
<P>
   And the business of chefs is, more than ever, business. And yet,
as Laurent Manrique, who left Gertrude's in March to become the
executive chef at Campton Place in San Francisco, explained:
``Chefs are in a world of food and craziness. They don't always
make the best business decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the gold standard to which many of them aspire is
Vongerichten and Ducasse, they figure ``if it works for Ducasse,
maybe then it works for me,'' Vongerichten said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their vaunted Gallic rationalism, the French have a
weakness for psychic gobbledygook. Business decisions in France are
often made with the aid of an astrologer. Banks there have been
known to require handwriting samples with job applications.
</P>
<P>
   Before adopting his current vocation, Brasset was himself a
businessman, an executive at Generale des Eaux, France's largest
water company. He met his first geomancer 15 years ago, then became
one himself, full time, in 1993. His hangout was the Parisian
two-star restaurant Ledoyen, where he did readings and befriended
the maitre d'hotel, Jamais, now at Daniel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really came to understand chefs and the pressures they work
under,'' Brasset said. ``Chefs are anguished. At night, after
service, when everything is quiet, they have questions and no one
to turn to.''
</P>
<P>
   Vongerichten agreed. ``I work with people all day long,'' he
said. ``I'm never alone, but I never really have the chance to talk
about the issues and decisions that are very important to me. These
are the things I talk to Jerome about.'' Brasset also showed him
how to ``communicate'' and ``to be more open,'' Vongerichten said.
</P>
<P>
   Strip away the pseudomathematical mumbo jumbo, and Brasset is
also a therapist, a validater of anxieties. Palladin requested a
two-and-a-half-hour session a couple of weeks ago to help him deal
with personal issues. ``A relationship just came to an end, and I
need someone to give me advice on how I can take it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, to these chefs, Brasset is _ how do you say? _
there for them. As Jamais put it: ``Most of the time when you have
a question, you already have a thought. You just need to be
convinced to listen to what is in your mind.''
</P>
<P>
   And then do whatever Jerome says. &QL;

SOME TV SERIES FALL, OTHERS MARCH ON: WHAT'LL BE MISSED, WHAT

   (bl)  
 By CARYN JAMES

<TEXT>
<P>
   This season, Dr. Kate Austin on ``Chicago Hope'' joined NASA and
planned to go into outer space (many of us thought this annoying
character belonged there in the first place.) ``NYPD Blue''
resorted to dream scenes about Detective Andy Sipowicz's father and
acted out the plot of a noir detective novel. And ``ER'' gave Dr.
Mark Greene his very own stalker.
</P>
<P>
   This was the season in which dramas that had once been
television's grittiest, most gripping and most realistic turned
bland or ridiculous. And as the writers cooked up their desperate
schemes (maybe they were bored, too) the dramas continued to lose
much of their kick and part of their audiences.
</P>
<P>
   The television season officially ends Wednesday night, with a
two-hour episode of ``Law and Order'' (NBC at 9) the best and
freshest drama on any network. But such freshness has become a
glaring exception among long-running shows.
</P>
<P>
   Two things that didn't happen recently may illuminate the fate
of network drama. CBS decided not to schedule ``Falcone,'' a Mafia
series it had planned for fall; the network had reportedly been
high on the show, but said that after the school shootings in
Littleton, Colo., it seemed too violent.
</P>
<P>
   And NBC decided not to renew the tepidly rated ``Homicide.''
Until this year, ``Homicide'' had been extraordinary in its power
and honesty; by the time it was canceled, it was an aging series
being put out of its misery.
</P>
<P>
   Though ``Homicide'' is the only one of these series not
returning, the end of a cycle seems near. The new season is loaded
with mush-brained dramas in the mold of the sugary NBC hit
``Providence,'' about a woman who returns to her hometown and finds
that family love can conquer anything (including death and disease
for pets and humans). Wish-fulfillment fantasies are beginning to
squeeze out volatile shows attached to reality.
</P>
<P>
   Part of this shift is simply old age catching up with
established shows. ``Chicago Hope'' and ``ER'' have been through
five seasons and ``NYPD Blue'' six. How many more times can Mark
Greene (Anthony Edwards) yell ``Stat!'' or Andy Sipowicz (Dennis
Franz) say ``skell''? Just as important, 24-hour news channels and
news magazines have taken over more of television's time, making
fictional dramas seem that much more fake. And in the face of
violent world events, viewers may be longing for good news and
escapism.
</P>
<P>
   But the nine-year-old ``Law and Order,'' with its focus on
headline-related stories, has remained compellingly near reality;
and its revolving door of characters has helped shelter it from the
aging process. (So-called reality shows are in a lurid category all
their own.)
</P>
<P>
   This season, several aging shows lost their most intriguing
characters. The emotionally wrenching death of Bobby Simone, Jimmy
Smits' character on ``NYPD Blue,'' was a high point of the series,
which fell apart soon after. George Clooney's character walked away
from ``ER'' this season, which was also the first without Andre
Braugher's intensity on ``Homicide.'' Yet those losses weren't the
only reasons the shows went flat.
</P>
<P>
   The characters who filled the voids were featherweights.
Giancarlo Esposito's character, the son of the ``Homicide'' squad's
lieutenant, was always underwritten. On ``NYPD Blue,'' Bobby was
replaced by Rick Schroder as young Detective Danny Sorenson. But
Smits' character had carried a note of unrealistic glamour (he wore
that trench coat as if he were modeling for GQ) and mystery (he was
more seductive and enigmatic than anyone else on TV). Schroder is
surprisingly convincing, but his character is another blue-collar,
hard-working cop, who volunteers to interview a child because, he
says, ``He's familiar wid my mug.'' (Can't one character on that
show speak English instead of TV cop talk?) Danny is not a star,
something even the grittiest dramas need for balance.
</P>
<P>
   And one glance at ``ER'' reruns reveals that Clooney's Doug Ross
was more fascinating in the early years, when he was a womanizing
cad. The sensitive Doug who left was no great loss.
</P>
<P>
   Even when a character starts out a hero, he runs into long-term
problems. How many trials can he endure before dramatic events seem
stupidly melodramatic rather than tragic? On ``NYPD Blue'' Andy had
already recovered from alcoholism and prostate cancer and faced the
shooting death of a grown son. Last week his wife was shot and
killed, giving him first place in any Job look-alike contest. These
shows seem trapped inside hermetic bubbles of recycled plots and
romances. (Danny falls for Bobby's widow, but so far she's not
interested.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Law and Order'' has never existed inside that bubble of stale
air. Wednesday night's finale, which involves the Russian Mafia and
a money-laundering scheme, is not one of the year's best but is
still more absorbing than most other dramas.
</P>
<P>
   Though the show may look formulaic, with its detectives rounding
up suspects in the first half-hour and lawyers prosecuting them in
the second, the writers skew their stories off the headlines in a
way that keeps viewers guessing. One twisty murder plot involved
the theft of frozen embryos. Another, about a teen-ager who kills
her baby at the prom, kept shifting suspicion about who got rid of
the body: was it the young woman, her boyfriend, or her own father?
Knowing how any real life event turns out (like a similar case in
New Jersey) won't necessarily help.
</P>
<P>
   That skewed quality is essential to the series' liveliness.
Compare it with ``Chicago Hope,'' which also has up-to-the-minute
references. This season one of its doctors performed a hand
transplant, proving that dropping news stories into a drama can
seem as strained as making up dream scenes.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Despite its lethal plots, ``Law and Order'' isn't gloomy. One of
the season's strongest episodes had Julia Roberts as a society
fund-raiser who gave her lover the Viagra that killed him. Her
presence added a winking playfulness to the scenes in which she
flirted with Detective Rey Curtis (her real-life beau, Benjamin
Bratt). Even more mischievously, her character outsmarts the
detectives and lawyers to get away with murder. When Bratt's
character is written out of the series tonight, it is handled in a
few quick scenes that are not milked for their sentimentality.
</P>
<P>
   Not every casting decision is perfect. Abby Carmichael (Angie
Harmon), the assistant district attorney who came in this year,
still seems a one-note character who would give a criminal the
death penalty for stealing a wallet if she could. But at least
``Law and Order'' isn't afraid of offending viewers with abrasive
personalities. As a Russian character says in tonight's episode,
pointing at Carmichael, ``That girl, she has heart like KGB.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a difference between a prickly but principled
character, like Sam Waterston's Jack McCoy on ``Law and Order,''
and a character who simply gets on viewers' nerves, like the
heavy-sighing, tedious Kate Austin (Christine Lahti) on ``Chicago
Hope.'' Luckily, she's been fired. David E. Kelley, the creator of
``Chicago Hope,'' forestalled cancellation by promising CBS to
revamp the series.
</P>
<P>
   In this season's final episode, shown last week, Mandy
Patinkin's egotistical character, Dr. Jeffrey Geiger, returned to
the series and cut the staff by half. Bringing back Geiger adds an
edge, but there's no way of knowing whether that will be enough to
rejuvenate the show.
</P>
<P>
   Television's David Kelley problem is singular, but it is not, as
commonly assumed, that he is spread so thin, writing ``The
Practice'' and ``Ally McBeal'' along with producing two new
projects for next season, a detective comedy called ``Snoops'' and
a half-hour of recycled ``Ally McBeal'' snippets and outtakes
called ``Ally.'' The Kelley problem is that his shows begin with
immense creative energy, then go foolishly over the top in about
one season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Practice'' began two years ago as a tough-minded legal
drama, and at its best still is. But any series that has a
defendant walk into the lawyers' office with a severed head in his
medical bag, claiming he was framed for murder, has moved several
light-years from realism. That plot led to a stunning season
finale, a Hitchcockian moment in which a (presumed) murderer
dressed as a nun turns to face the camera; he turns out to be none
other than the defendant who had brought in the severed head, and
whom the ``Practice'' lawyers had helped set free.
</P>
<P>
   But too many weird ``Ally'' moments have invaded ``The
Practice.'' In one, a judge ordered a defendant to take his pants
off in court. In an ``Ally McBeal'' courtrooom that would be
nothing; in a supposedly realistic drama it is loony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ally McBeal'' is nowhere near realistic, of course, which is
why the words ``feminism'' and ``Ally McBeal'' have never belonged
in the same sentence despite much hair-tearing about the issue. The
show's best moments are comic. Bruce Willis turned up as a
hilariously nasty psychiatrist. Every now and then John Cage (Peter
MacNichol) bursts into an hysterically funny dance. More often, the
show is pretentious, with lawyers delivering speeches that are
supposedly about hot-button social issues (marriage, motherhood,
sexual harassment) but are really blather. For realism, there was
the show's star, Calista Flockhart, snapping at Connie Chung on a
recent ``20/20'' when asked whether she had an eating disorder.
``What do you think I'm going to say, `Yeah, I do'?'' Ms. Flockhart
said before denying the endless rumors.
</P>
<P>
   Grit and realism haven't entirely disappeared from new dramas.
One of the few bright spots on the fall schedule is a spinoff
called ``Law and Order: Special Victims Unit,'' which used to be
more bluntly titled ``Sex Crimes.'' But like the original ``Law and
Order,'' it is an anomaly. The ``Ally McBeal'' influence is
growing. Several new shows combine the ``Ally'' approach of whimsy
and a pretense to social relevance with the treacly feel-good
philosophy of ``Providence.'' (Shudder.)
</P>
<P>
   Several apparently gushy shows come to mind: NBC's ``Cold
Feet,'' about three couples in various states of relationships;
ABC's ``Once and Again,'' about divorced 40-somethings, and
``Wasteland,'' about single 20-somethings. Television viewers may
soon long for the good old days when a drama's heroine had the cold
heart of the KGB.

Kansas City's biggest money maker, the Water Department. Since
Barnes has taken office, she's ordered an audit of the Water
Department that some see as the first step towards ``privatizing''
its operations. A draft plan of Environmental Management Inc.'s

   PIPE: Far away in Alaska, when the pictures show oil-soaked

disaster such as the Exxon Valdez will easily capture the national
limelight. Much closer to home, however, the potential for another
kind of petroleum disaster lurks underground, along 150,000 miles
of pipelines that transport hazardous liquids through such places
as rural Atchison. Ruptured lines can occur anywhere, from
Coffeyville, Kan., to Glasgow, Mo., to just outside the nation's
capitol in Washington. They may not get the publicity of an Exxon
Valdez, but pipeline breaks caused $54 million in property damage
last year in the U.S., and by one count spilled 7.7 million gallons
of oil and other substances. The Environmental Defense Fund calls
that the worst toll in eight years, and charges that federal
regulators don't do nearly enough to prevent incidents like the
pipeline break outside Atchison. Pipeline companies say they still

`INVENTING PARADISE': ON A GREEK ODYSSEY BY LAND, SEA AND POETRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By RICHARD EDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Mono dyo atoma.'' Posted beside a Greek elevator, all this
means is that it would be a poor ride for more than two
individuals. For a foreign individual, though, what a grand thing
to be addressed as an atom (I and the cosmos, arm in arm). Or to be
addressed as ``Kyrios.''
</P>
<P>
   Christian or otherwise, there is a 2,000-year jolt in having
one's ``Mr.'' lofted to a declension of ``Kyrie,'' the word for God
in the Greek New Testament and the Latin Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Tug a root and the tree quivers. Despite changes, the Greek
language and the unchanged light, sea and landscape carry roots not
just of Western civilization but of all the civilizations the West
has touched as well. For centuries, visitors have found a
particular exaltation there, granted that some mainly find cheap
vacations, sunburn and wine poisoning. Here is Henry Miller's:
</P>
<P>
   ``To fall in love with it is the easiest thing in the world. It
is like falling in love with one's own divine image reflected in a
thousand dazzling facets.'' Sounds silly? Miller's hyperactive
rhetoric was a whole sluice of silliness, which he panned for
nuggets of fundamental and unsuspected sense.
</P>
<P>
   The Greek spell is real but we tend to snub experiences we
cannot explain. Talking about a gods-haunted landscape seems facile
until Miller reverses it: Greece can make a visitor feel godlike.
</P>
<P>
   The Miller quote is from ``Inventing Paradise'' by Professor
Edmund Keeley, a lifelong student of modern Greece and a translator
of its literature. ``Paradise'' is a wonderfully personal hybrid:
part history, part literary evocation, part memoir and most of all
a travel journal. The travels are by land and by book.
</P>
<P>
   Keeley's own journeying is in the background, unobtrusive but
essential, as a quietly attentive host is essential at a salon of
luminaries. The luminaries include Miller and Lawrence Durrell, and
the constellation of Greeks, mostly poets, including two Nobel
laureates, with whom they forged a remarkable personal and
intellectual comradeship beginning a few years before World War II
and continuing a few years after.
</P>
<P>
   Keeley draws extensively on their writings for his account of
those years: diaries, journals, correspondence; Durrell's
``Prospero's Cell,'' which tells of his prewar sojourn on Corfu,
and Miller's ``Colossus of Maroussi,'' a paean to Greece drawn out
of a nine-month visit with Durrell and his Greek friends. This may
seem short, but it is the gestation time for a human and, in
Miller's case, for the imaginative re-creation of a country, a
culture and his own fierce energies.
</P>
<P>
   Miller and Durrell provide a wealth of scenes and portraits.
They lie on a Corfu beach while a shepherd drives his sheep over
and around their naked bodies as if they were two inconvenient
boulders. The village mayor comes down with his three English words
to swap tall tales about an imagined China, followed by music and
dancing.
</P>
<P>
   There are explorations of the Peloponnese, feasts and
expeditions with Miller's ``colossus'' _ George Katsimbalis, patron
of the Greek literary revival and a man with a Gargantuan appetite
for food, wine and poetry _ and endless talk with the poets: George
Seferis, Odysseus Elytis, the sea captain D.I. Antoniou and others.
</P>
<P>
   There was the painter Niko Ghika, and Constantine Tsatsos, the
political battler against dictatorship who became Greece's
president decades later after the colonels shriveled and blew away.
</P>
<P>
   No dividing line, you see, between poetry and life or landscape
or national history or tradition or politics or the blinding light.
This was a revelation to the British Durrell and the American
Miller, for whom alienation and literature were synonymous.
</P>
<P>
   But I risk giving them too much space. They are Keeley's way
into his theme and provide a lot of the fun; they are only part of
it, though, and not its most memorable fun.
</P>
<P>
   As for the theme, ``Inventing Paradise'' observes that for more
than a century after Lord Byron, travelers to Greece noted little
but the remains and artifacts of its classical civilization. The
living inhabitants were bothersome, unsanitary and irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   The extreme of post-Byronism, though the poet criticized it, was
the removal of the Elgin marbles from the Parthenon to sanitary and
imperially relevant London. It was equivalent to the barbaric
notion, to be voiced by later tourists, that France would be
perfect were it not for the French, begging the question of who put
France there and, day by day, keeps it there.
</P>
<P>
   Durrell and Miller were the first generation of those who,
literally at least, restored the marbles. (In the next generation
were the writers Patrick Leigh Fermor, Rex Warner and others
including, though he barely notes it, Keeley). They treated Greece
not as a museum but a place where some of the spirit and genius
that fill our museums and nourish our literature are found in the
speech, gestures and passions of a living people.
</P>
<P>
   It was a great discovery or invention. (The author implies both,
which is proper because what art creates is thereby created and
becomes the object of discovery.) But it did not really belong to
the foreigners; at most they were brilliant witnesses to what their
Greek comrades were doing.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the book, the author keeps returning to Seferis,
Elytis, Angelos Sikelianos, Yannis Ritsos and other poets, citing
letters, conversations and above all their poetry.
</P>
<P>
   With his commentary, this poetry, which he and Philip Sherrard
had previously translated, is the heart of the book. The lengthy
excerpts from the great poems of Seferis, in particular _
``Thrush,'' ``The King of Asini'' _ close a magical double ring.
</P>
<P>
   They bring the power of the old myths and the ancient writers to
bear, with the greatest naturalness and art, upon the dimensions of
life today, Greek specifically but not exclusively. The poetry
makes an elevated sense, in other words, of the contemporary
experience. With these contemporary implications, it also gives a
new and unexpected vitality to the classics and the myths.
</P>
<P>
   It is the same land, sea, light (Seferis draws great darkness
out of the light) that Sophocles and Homer knew, and a language of
strong kinship and many of the same properties. The gods hung out
in the same spots; they spoke the same language.
</P>
<P>
   Such gods, so nonabstract, nonholy and so inveterately attached
to human places, pleasures and passions, are available to a Greek
poet. Even their absence is a place and their silence a language.
Writing of present and past, of Miller and Seferis, of Seferis and
the gods and, occasionally, of himself and Seferis, Keeley has made
a complex and illuminating connection.

WITH ARTIST'S DEVOTION AND LONG HOURS, UNUSUAL BIBLE TAKES SHAPE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Tenn.)  (mk) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HATFIELD, Mass. _ In a cozy and neatly kept studio at his home
here, the artist Barry Moser has been working on a task that
recalls a much earlier historical era, creating hundreds of
individual images to illustrate the Bible, from Creation to
Apocalypse.
</P>
<P>
   Since early 1996, Moser, who is widely known as an illustrator
of children's books and classics, has devoted each day to working
on what will total 231 engravings for an unusual edition of the
King James version of the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last three decades he has done illustrations for
``Moby-Dick,'' ``Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,'' ``The
Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'' and much else. But his current
project has engaged him with a seriousness beyond anything in his
previous work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing else ever obsessed me,'' Moser said, in a voice
resonant of his Tennessee roots. ``I've become so obsessed with
this, I dream about it. I've had dreams about conversations with
the Blessed Virgin. I've had dreams about having conversations with
the Apostle Paul.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``There is no way this project could be approached
with any kind of lightheartedness.''
</P>
<P>
   His Bible, in two volumes and of a size and heft usually found
on church lecterns, will be a thing of luxury, printed in only 400
copies, an instant rarity. Its type will be modeled on a
16th-century form, its paper specially made by a four-century-old
German company.
</P>
<P>
   His effort is reaching completion at the very time that another
unusual Bible project is just beginning. In March an order of
Benedictine monks in Minnesota announced plans to create what they
described as the only handwritten, illuminated Bible to be
commissioned since Gutenberg invented movable type in the 15th
century.
</P>
<P>
   When Moser's Bible is published in October, it will be called
the Pennyroyal Caxton Bible. The name combines that of the
Pennyroyal Press _ Moser is its proprietor _ and that of the
company of his financial backer. Each copy will cost $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Each Bible in an even more exclusive 30-copy run will cost more
than twice that; it will be printed on handmade paper and bound in
five volumes, and carry an additional suite of prints and other
archival material. Moser said his goal ``is to produce one of the
most beautiful books of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   (For those of ordinary means, there will also be a trade
edition, published by Viking Studio.)
</P>
<P>
   Illustrating the Bible is an ancient art form, dating back to
post-Roman-era Christian scribes who painted miniature scenes on
parchment. The craft came to full flower under Charlemagne's
patronage, with monks creating illuminated manuscripts. Even after
the invention of movable type, the tradition continued. The first
complete English-language Bible, in 1535, contained more than 150
woodblock prints.
</P>
<P>
   But for a single artist to produce hundreds of illustrations for
both the Old and New Testaments is exceptionally rare. The person
who is best known for having done so is probably Gustave Dore, a
Frenchman whose illustrated Holy Bible was published in 1865.
</P>
<P>
   In this century a few prominent painters have created their own
interpretations of biblical texts, most notably Marc Chagall, who
produced an illustrated Hebrew Bible. But the sheer number of
illustrations by Dore 130 years ago and Moser today, as well as the
fact that their work encompasses both Testaments, puts them in a
special category. For those who study religion and contemporary
art, Moser's project is unusual, too, in that America's Protestant
culture has never been especially encouraging of serious efforts to
illustrate the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   William Dyrness, dean of the school of theology at Fuller
Theological Seminary in Pasadena, Calif., said, ``In the American
tradition people tended to be a bit suspicious of using high art in
a way because it distracted people from the literal word of the
Bible.'' He said he had not known about Moser's project but was
intrigued by it.
</P>
<P>
   While Dore tended to favor crowded scenes in his illustrations,
Moser focuses on individuals, which lends his engravings a
memorable intensity. He portrays Jonah from the neck up, the
prophet's head breaking the ocean's surface while the immense tail
of the fish that will swallow him rises behind.
</P>
<P>
   His infant Jesus sits in Mary's lap, the tiny arms outstretched
in a gesture that anticipates the Crucifixion. But as an adult
Jesus is a lonelier figure, depicted by Moser in a moment of
magisterial solitude after being scourged by Roman soldiers and
crowned with thorns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep wanting to emphasize his isolation,'' Moser said,
``because the Son of God would have to be isolated. He would have
no contemporaries.''
</P>
<P>
   As an artist working in an era that prizes the individual above
the crowd, Moser takes an approach that works as an act of biblical
interpretation in its own right.
</P>
<P>
   As the Rev. Peter Gomes, minister at the Memorial Church at
Harvard University, writes in ``The Good Book'' (Morrow, 1996):
``The dynamic quality of Scripture has to do with the fact that
while the text itself does not change, we who read that text do
change; it is not that we adapt ourselves to the world of the Bible
and play at recreating it as in a pageant or a tableau `long ago
and far away.' Rather, it is that the text actually adapts itself
to our capacity to hear it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Because the types of wood Moser thinks most suitable for
engraving are scarce and very expensive, he uses a substance called
Resingrave, a cast epoxy resin. ``It's the stuff you see,
basically, that lawn furniture is made out of,'' he said. ``It's
very strong, very brittle, and engraves like a dream, if the tools
are sharp enough. It's the perfect substitute, as far as I'm
concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Of greater importance to the project, however, is Moser's
self-discipline. ``It's devotion,'' he said. ``It's a certain
degree of pig-headedness, simplemindedness, to sit between the 6's
_ 6 in the morning, 6 in the evening _seven days a week, 52 weeks a
year.''
</P>
<P>
   He has also assembled an advisory board for his work: poets,
religion scholars and technical specialists. The project has been
underwritten by a collector of rare books, Bruce Kovner, chairman
of Caxton Corp., an investment management company named for the
English printer William Caxton.
</P>
<P>
   Moser is a native of Chattanooga, Tenn., and so comes from a
region, the South, that Flannery O'Connor described as
``Christ-haunted.''
</P>
<P>
   He was no more than conventionally religious, he said, until the
winter afternoon in 1959 when he narrowly missed being struck by a
hunter's stray bullet. Feeling that Providence had spared his life
for a reason, he eventually became a minister, although he did not
attend a seminary, and served in churches in Tennessee and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   But he moved to New England 30 years ago and took up the study
of engraving. His memories of his career as a minister are not
warm. ``Today I look back on that, and I think of the unmitigated
arrogance of a 19-year-old kid to preach to older people and call
them for their shortcomings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moser no longer has any formal connection with a church, put
off, he said, by instances of hypocrisy he encountered in
congregations he served. But he possesses a sense of the religious
history around him. On a brief visit to Northampton, Mass., he
pointed out the brownstone church that stands on the site where
Jonathan Edwards, the 18th-century theologian, preached for much of
his career.
</P>
<P>
   Moser has undertaken religious subjects before, although not on
the scale of this project. He illustrated a translation of Dante's
``Divine Comedy'' and an edition of John Bunyan's ``Pilgrim's
Progress.'' He did preliminary designs for an illustrated Bible a
decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the inclination toward the current project goes further
back. And as he has worked at it, so it has also achieved a force
of its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it is that has compelled me to do this,''
Moser said. ``But something has been compelling me to do this ever
since I was marching cadence in military school.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``To what do I ascribe it? I don't know. Whatever
it is that has compelled me to do this, is, I think, at work in
it.''

   Studio Reining in Violence on `Jerry Springer'
</P>
<P>
   The studio that owns ``The Jerry Springer Show'' _ the daytime
talk show notorious for violence, profanity and physical
confrontation _ announced Tuesday that it will edit those three
elements out of future shows.
</P>
<P>
   Although its producers had agreed to eliminate violence from the
show starting last June, Springer voiced displeasure, since it was
violence that had sent his show's Nielsen ratings and advertising
revenues soaring. Soon, violent confrontations and bleeped
profanity were back.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Studios USA, the show's owner, is cracking down, apparently
in response to renewed pressure from politicians, religious leaders
and viewers in Chicago, where the show is produced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will inform stations that we are not providing any Jerry
Springer program if these standards cannot be met,'' a Studios USA
statement said. Springer could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Springer crackdown was the latest of several moves by
television executives nervous about how far to go with violence.
</P>
<P>
   Citing ``the current climate,'' the WB network pre-empted the
season finale of ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' Tuesday night,
showing a rerun instead.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Buffy,'' a campy teen-age melodrama about vampires,
is indisputably fantasy, and the scene causing concern showed a
wicked high school principal transforming into a 60-foot serpent
whom the students must slay, the network nonetheless felt pressure
to pull it.
</P>
<P>
   The ``current climate'' refers to the national anxiety about
violence, particularly among young people, since the school
shooting that left 15 dead in Littleton, Colo. Since that attack on
April 20, several shows have been altered or pulled from the
schedule, including an earlier ``Buffy'' episode, an episode of
CBS's ``Promised Land'' and all of this week's episodes of Jerry
Springer.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when broadcast networks unveiled their fall schedules
to advertisers and the press, there were about the usual number of
shows featuring violence, generally police or science fiction
dramas.
</P>
<P>
   But Leslie Moonves, president of CBS Television, said he had
rejected a promising pilot about two Mafia families (loosely based
on the film ``Donnie Brasco'') in part because of its gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   And Doug Herzog, Fox's entertainment chief, took pains to assure
reporters that the video clip they had just seen for ``Harsh
Realm,'' a new show from the creator of ``The X-Files,'' had more
violence than the series would have, and that the network would
monitor it ``closely.''
</P>
<P>
   These programmers seem caught in a bind: on one hand, they
insist that television violence is far down the list of social ills
that contribute to actual violence; on the other, they do not wish
to alienate viewers or politicians who believe otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Moonves said Tuesday that while networks did not ``bear
responsibility for what happened in Littleton,'' they should still
``police themselves.'' He pointed out that last year the industry
had agreed to a ratings system (age-group categories with
additional code letters for violence, sex or foul language) for use
with a V-chip on new television sets, and that in response Congress
had agreed not to pursue legislation to regulate the content of
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Moonves added that the industry should be ``proactive'' in
showing gun violence negatively, as has been done with smoking or
alcohol abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Guns are not used in ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer.'' For WB,
Tuesday night's episode apparently posed a timing problem. Jamie
Kellner, WB's president, said the decision was influenced by the
fact that the climactic scene occurred on a high school campus
(Buffy's vampire-slaying heroics usually take place deep
underground or late at night) and during commencement.
</P>
<P>
   Even fantasy violence against a giant serpent, Kellner said,
``is inappropriate to broadcast around the actual dates of these
time-honored ceremonies.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the show's creators and fans, Tuesday night's
scheduled episode was the second of a two-part season finale _ the
first part was shown last week _ and WB said it would broadcast
both parts later in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask real people, in polls, what leads to this
violence,'' Valenti said on Monday, ``No. 1 is access to guns, No.
2 is inadequate parental supervision, No. 3 is lack of ethical and
moral values in society. Entertainment is way down the list.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is evidently high enough on the list that television
programmers are thinking twice about violent content before giving
it the go-ahead. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ratings Hieroglyphics &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the television season and the May ratings sweep grinding to
their official ends Thursday, the networks were analyzing the
ratings results Tuesday like archeologists searching ancient
scribblings in the hope of finding the secret chamber of gold.
</P>
<P>
   Every network had its own translation: NBC cited its continued
leadership among viewers most desired by advertisers; ABC cited a
slight uptick in the May sweep as indication of momentum; Fox cited
leadership with many categories of younger male viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Only CBS wanted to look at the broadest possible interpretation,
because by the measures that used to be definitive indicators of
network leadership _ household rating and total number of viewers _
CBS was, indisputably, the winner. CBS will average about 13.03
million viewers per week for the season, NBC about 12.67 million,
ABC about 11.76 million and Fox about 10.63 million.
</P>
<P>
   But no other network wants to change places with CBS because
even with all those viewers, the network will finish dead last in
both broad audience categories on which most advertising time is
sold, adults between the ages of 18 and 49 and between 25 and 54.
</P>
<P>
   CBS thus became the first network ever to have the most viewers
overall but the fewest that advertisers want to reach. CBS
executives argued that they are doing a better job selling their
older audience to advertisers, though they conceded they still get
a lower price for their commercials than the other networks.
</P>
<P>
   NBC still won the 18-to-49-year-old competition, which the other
three networks identify as their measuring stick. But NBC was off
by the biggest margin in that category, down 18 percent from last
season, and Fox was closer than ever. But Fox needed the Super Bowl
and World Series to get that close and won't have them next season.
</P>
<P>
   And NBC did lose the total-viewers race to CBS, which it had not
been shy about saying it had won last season and for several
seasons before that. As for the May sweep, NBC won more easily,
beating both Fox and ABC among the young adult viewers and CBS for
total viewers.
</P>
<P>
   The only network showing any growth for the season was once
again the newcomer WB, which went up a fraction. That growth took
place entirely among women. The network was down among male
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   But the overwhelming direction of network television is
downward. CBS, NBC and ABC all had their lowest ratings ever, while
Fox had its lowest rating since 1986, the first year it went on the
air.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the networks anticipate taking in a record amount of
advertising money next fall. The reason: they still reach far more
viewers than any other viewing option.

   USCHINA _ China's two-decade effort to steal U.S. weapons
technology has positioned Beijing to develop modern mobile nuclear
warheads as good as America's, a bipartisan congressional report
said today. An ``insatiable appetite'' for U.S. technology leaves
China ready to leap from a 1950s nuclear weapons program to
sophisticated designs ``on par with our own,'' concludes the
report. The report describes a breadth of Chinese espionage that is
so threatening to U.S. interests that some members of Congress have
compared it to the theft of atomic bomb secrets by the Soviet Union
in the 1940s. The fallout could have a profound impact on the
operation of U.S. weapons labs and on U.S.-Chinese relations. The
House and Senate have called for in-depth hearings on Chinese
espionage and U.S. nuclear security. Richardson within days is
expected to announce disciplinary action against a number of Energy
Department and lab employees in connection with anti-espionage
lapses. (Carr, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

could plunge into war before apartheid would end, has experienced a
degree of reconciliation that many people consider a miracle. But

Nelson Mandela, they know that _ with unemployment and crime sky
high, the economy stagnant and education in desperate straits _
this country that is basking in the glow of one miracle is now
badly in need of a second. An overview of where the country stands

stats: 6,000 kids caught bringing guns to school but just 13
criminal prosections by the Clinton administration. The stat has
been cited by numerous political figures who are fighting gun
control. But there's just one problem: the statistic isn't really

   FLA-BISHOP-RESURFACES _ ALMA, Mich. _ Bishop J. Keith Symons,
the former leader of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Palm Beach,
Fla., resigned in disgrace last June after admitting to sexually
abusing five young men as a young priest more than 30 years ago.
The fallen bishop, who had served the five-county diocese of Palm
Beach for nearly eight years, was quickly and quietly whisked out
of town. He left a perfunctory written word of regret to the
220,000 Roman Catholics in the diocese. There had been no hint of
his whereabouts, his spiritual state or his physical well-being for
more than 11 months. Symons just disappeared. Church spokesmen said
he was in a treatment center but wouldn't say where. Last
Wednesday, he surfaced as the leader of a day of prayer dedicated
to the Virgin Mary at the St. Francis Retreat Center in Dewitt,
Mich., about 6 miles north of Lansing, the state capital. Attempts
by The Palm Beach Post to learn more of Symons' status were
unsuccessful. Telephone calls last Thursday from West Palm Beach to
diocesan leaders in Lansing were not returned. Spokesmen had little
to say. The church in Michigan quickly wrapped a protective blanket
of secrecy around Symons. (Gushee, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   RETIREMENT-HAVEN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Call the Department
of Elder Affairs in Tallahassee to inquire about retiring to
Florida _ as thousands of out-of-staters do every year _ and you're
not going to hear about sugar-sand beaches, emerald golf courses or
the army of senior care experts and institutions here to care for
you if you falter. But you will be warned of what you might be
giving up: government benefits, four seasons, proximity to your
family. Call Arizona, Mississippi, Alabama or Texas and you'll get
an altogether different response _ a come-hither sales pitch worthy
of Dale Carnegie. In the world of retirement destinations, Florida
is still the 800-pound gorilla, but things are changing and the
Sunshine State will likely not be the de facto choice for Baby
Boomers that it was for their parents and grandparents. (Belkin,
Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   The smell is what you notice first, even before you've taken a
proper look at the stage from which it emanates. It's the thick
aroma of fat heated up for deep frying, mixed with fleeting
suggestions of spice, and you can't shake it out of your nostrils
for the rest of the evening.
</P>
<P>
   That odor is one of a battery of sensory invaders in the lively
production of ``East Is East,'' Ayub Khan-Din's awkward but
affectionate tale of domestic and cultural combat among the
Pakistani owner of a chips (as in fish and chips) shop in
northwestern England, his British wife and their many children.
</P>
<P>
   There's the 1970s pop music, both Anglo-American and
Pakistani-Indian, that seeps out of radios, along with the drones
of canned laughter from a television and the continuous din of
raised voices in different accents. And the divided set, half of
which is devoted to the fragrant, tidily kept diner, boggles the
eyes with its other half: a living room teeming with mixed patterns
and pervasive clutter.
</P>
<P>
   Even though you're in the distancing darkness of the audience,
you start to feel a little crowded, a little cramped, hungry for
breathing and elbow room. Very much, in fact, like the characters
in the play you're watching.
</P>
<P>
   Those familiar with the work of Scott Elliott won't be surprised
by the viscera-grabbing techniques he employs in ``East Is East,''
which opened last night at Stage 1 of City Center. As the artistic
director of the New Group, Elliott has made a specialty of serving
up steaming slices of alienated English life, in which you can
practically taste the sudsy ale as well as the characters'
disillusionment.
</P>
<P>
   Here, in the first collaboration between the New Group and the
Manhattan Theater Club, Elliott has a bigger budget and a larger
space in which to exercise his gritty theatrical magic, and he
takes full advantage of them, with sterling assistance from Derek
McLane, the set designer. If the results are less than entirely
persuasive, that has more to do with the script than with the
staging.
</P>
<P>
   This play can definitely seem forced in its big moments of
insight, but in between those revelations, the production pulls you
right into the jumbled, fretful flow of one family's daily life.
Think of a hipper, more ambivalent variation on ``Life With
Father'' or ``Cheaper by the Dozen,'' laced with social dissonance,
and you'll get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   A critical hit in London at the Royal Court Theater two years
ago, this warmhearted, bumpy work is overly shaped by the ordering
rhythms associated with the television shows its characters feast
on, right down to a climactic scene in which a plucky mother tells
off a bigwig who insults her children. The play's strength is,
instead, in its sprawl, in its sense of the cozy disorder of an
oversize, ethnically mixed and emotionally muddled family in close
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``East Is East,'' which has already been turned into a
low-budget film to be released here later this year, is the first
play by Khan-Din, 37, who is best known as a movie actor. It is
clearly autobiographical, though its author has, quite reasonably,
allotted his fictional family three fewer children than its
real-life prototype of 10.
</P>
<P>
   That's still more than enough to keep any director occupied, and
Elliott and his ensemble do a solid job in keeping individual
identities vivid and distinct. On one level, these characters do
bizarrely recall the classic family of Lindsay and Crouse's ``Life
With Father.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, there's a patriarch with whims of iron and unbudging
notions of child rearing, and a mother who acts as peacemaker and
rift-healer, while ducking confrontations with the husband she
loves. That equation is skewed by Dad's status as a Pakistani
immigrant who after decades in England still clings to the
traditions of his homeland, including arranged marriages for his
children. Filial resistance leads to acts of violence that would
never have penetrated the universe of Lindsay and Crouse.
</P>
<P>
   Edward A. Hajj, an actor making his professional debut here, and
the excellent Jenny Sterlin are the mother and father, George and
Ella Khan, and they give off a reflexive air of both comfort and
annoyance with each other that sets the evening's tone. You can
sense the persistence of a love between two strangely matched souls
that continues to baffle their children, and Khan-Din wisely
refrains from overloading the script with expository details of
family history.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the show is at its best at its most relaxed, fluidly
finding the domestic rhythms and rituals of the Khan household,
where cultural paradox is taken for granted and privacy is a rare
luxury. The early morning scenes, with the boys (five of them, to
one girl) dressing themselves in the living room out of a laundry
basket, feel vivid and true. So do the moments in which the
children riff disrespectfully about their father while working in
the family restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   It's when the play stoops to explain itself that it seems
forced. Must we really be told so explicitly why the youngest
child, Sajit (Rishi Mehta), is hiding from the world in a hooded
parka he refuses to take off? Do Abdul (Dariush Kashani) and Maneer
(Amir Sajadi), the obedient sons, and Tariq (Rahul Khanna), the
rebellious one, need to face off in such blunt declarations of
principles?
</P>
<P>
   The actors playing the children, who also include Gregory J.
Qaiyum and Purva Bedi, have developed an organic synchronicity that
falters only in the play's segues into violence. The moments of
brutality don't shock as they should, partly because Hajj, a
sprightly and small man, never projects the necessary menace or
combustible anger, as though the actor were slightly afraid of the
character.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sterlin, whose long, equine face seems perpetually tugged by
both wryness and weariness, is first-rate. Whether sharing a
cigarette with her best friend, Annie (nicely played by Christine
Child), or calling the exotic names of her children in a hoarse,
mechanical litany, Ms. Sterlin's Ella conveys equal parts affection
and irritation in every breath.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Khan-Din's play, when it's not being self-conscious,
projects, too: an instinctive sense of the family hearth as
somewhere you want to escape from and to stay in forever, the first
and the last place you want to be.

`AMERICAN HOLLOW': A RURAL KENTUCKY FAMILY UNITED BY HOME AND
WANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   All things considered, Iree Bowling, the wizened matriarch at
the center of Rory Kennedy's fine documentary film ``American
Hollow,'' is pleased with the way her life has turned out. With her
husband, Bass, this lean, weatherbeaten woman whose family has
lived for more than a century in the wilds of eastern Kentucky, has
brought up 13 children and is grandmother to more than 30. Now 68,
she still has the energy to care for her bedridden mother, visit
her mentally retarded sister, tend the large vegetable garden that
sustains the Bowlings, pluck chickens and cook meals for her
sprawling extended family.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Bowlings live within an hour's distance from one
another in a mile-wide valley between two mountains known as the
hollow. The film, which follows a year in their lives, celebrates
the clan's vitality while also revealing the devastating effects of
poverty and joblessness on several of its male members. One, who is
chronically depressed, relies on Prozac that is sent to him through
the mail. Over the years, many of the men have left the area to try
to make a living elsewhere, but most have eventually returned to a
place where food, shelter and emotional support are guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   How poor are the Bowlings? Early scenes follow two of Iree and
Bass' sons into the woods where they gather moss, blood root and
ginseng to sell. The money they make is supplemented by government
welfare checks and food stamps. The Bowlings may be poor, but most
seem to have televisions and cars. They wear the standard American
casual wear of oversize T-shirts, jeans and baseball caps.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Hollow'' concentrates on three family dramas. One
strand involves Iree's and Bass' son Edgar, who is arrested for
trespassing and held in the county jail for 17 days when the family
is unable to come up with $2,500 in bail money. The charges are
eventually withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Another involves Samantha, Iree's granddaughter, who is in the
process of divorcing her abusive husband, Jody. Samantha, who is
devoted to their two children, stoically tells of beatings and
threats on her life, and we see the damage Jody wreaked in their
trailer during one of his rages.
</P>
<P>
   The most poignant thread follows Clint, a skinny, redheaded
18-year-old grandson of Iree's who, against his family's advice, is
determined to marry his angel-faced 17-year-old sweetheart,
Shirley. But when she breaks off the engagement, the brokenhearted
Clint falls to pieces and eventually leaves the hollow to try his
luck in Cincinnati, where an uncle has agreed to take him in.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Hollow'' is a richly atmospheric movie that takes
pains to emphasize the positive aspects of the Bowlings' rural
existence. If the film suggests a family pattern of spousal abuse
(Iree's mother was for years treated like a dog and beaten with a
stick that was nicknamed Old Hector), it shies away from dwelling
on the tougher aspects of this hardscrabble life. It doesn't show
the Bowlings coping with winter or carrying on the grueling work of
planting, tending and harvesting crops in uncertain weather.
</P>
<P>
   A too-brief scene in a Pentecostal church shows Iree and several
family members in the throes of religious delirium, but the movie
doesn't examine the relation of their faith to the rest of their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the film, Iree allows that she has done a good job
of raising her family. The movie does a good job of showing us how
difficult it is for the poor to transcend their backgrounds and
move up the social ladder.

   WALLSTREET _ ATLANTA _ The stock market model at Georgia Tech
recently registered a ``sell'' signal. That alone would be
something to think about. It becomes even more thinkable when you
consider that it's only the fourth sell signal from that model in
more than a decade, and the previous three were in 1994, 1990 and
1987. (Walker, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED MONDAY.

 &HT;    GORE, IN 'BUSH COUNTRY' CITES SUCCESS OF ANTI-POVERTY PROGRAMS
 &HT;    410&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDINBURG, Texas _ Vice President Al Gore brought his
presidential campaign to ``Bush country'' Tuesday, touting
administration programs that have promoted economic growth in the
poverty-ridden Rio Grande Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Gore presided over the 5th annual conference sponsored by the
White House to review its program of ``empowerment zones'' and
``economic communities,'' launched as part of a 1993 economic
recovery initiative that was adamantly opposed by congressional
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The program provides grants, tax incentives and bonding
authority to economically distressed inner cities and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message (of that program) is clear _ we don't have to
become a nation of haves and have-nots, where some people do well
and others are left behind,'' Gore told the conference. ``We don't
have to be a country where cities and suburbs see each other as
enemies, protecting their boundaries like they are walls between
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference brought Gore and President Clinton together
publicly for the first time since the president critiqued the vice
president's campaign in remarks to the New York Times last week,
reportedly angering him.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, here largely to introduce Gore, called the vice
president a man with an ``unparalleled combination of creativity
and energy and strength and determination.'' He said Gore, more
than anyone else, had shown that creative government support could
bring new economic vitality to depressed communities.
</P>
<P>
   But with Clinton at his side, Gore inadvertently invited
comparisons of his often passionless style of campaigning to
Clinton's hallmark exuberance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an inevitable comparison, fair or unfair,'' said Housing
and Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo, who attended the
conference. ``The president is a master communicator of historic
proportions. The vice president has a different style, but he is a
very effective communicator.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore used the conference to announce two new administration
initiatives:
</P>
<P>
   _ $32 million in grants and loans to finance the cleanup and
redevelopment of old polluted industrial sites.
</P>
<P>
   _ A presidential order expanding the two-year-old Southwest
Border Regional Partnership, which has brought some 40
``empowerment zones'' and ``economic communities'' together to
tackle economic problems of the region.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Gore also called on Congress to fund a new round of
these zones.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   This community was chosen to host the conference, White House
officials said, because of the success of the Rio Grande Valley
Empowerment Zone: it has generated some $100 million in public and
private investment since its creation five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The counties that make up the empowerment zone have poverty and
unemployment rates significantly higher than U.S. or Texas rates.
In Hidalgo County, where the conference was held, 41.51 percent of
the residents live in poverty, compared to 17.66 percent in Texas
and 12.65 percent of the U.S. population. Its unemployment rate is
14.33 percent, compared to 7.11 percent statewide and 6.31
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the conference, Gore visited the agricultural community
of Sebastian. He visited the family of Sandra Puente, who graduated
from the University of Texas at Brownsville last weekend as a
result of an empowerment zone program that helped pay her tuition.
</P>
<P>
   He later introduced her to the conference as ``an empowerment
zone success story,'' sparking a spirited round of applause.
</P>
<P>
   The conference gave Gore an opportunity to travel to the home
state of Gov. George W. Bush, the current front-runner for the
Republican presidential nomination, for a mix of official duties,
campaign fund raising and solidifying his political ties to
Hispanic voters, who are likely to be pivotal in the 2000
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's schedule also included an appearance Tuesday night at a
Hispanic Democratic Unity rally in McAllen, an indication of the
importance Gore is placing on the Hispanic vote in his presidential
bid. Bush won an unprecedented number of Hispanic votes in his
re-election campaign last year, although estimates vary from 40
percent to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's three-day trip, which began Monday in Florida and
Georgia, is expected to yield some $850,000 for his presidential
campaign following fund-raising events Wednesday in Dallas and
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics is like fighting a way, but you shoot money instead
of bullets,'' Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes said at a private fund-raiser
for Gore in Atlanta on Monday. ``If there's not enough money, you
get overwhelmed. If you can't get money, you don't get your message
out.''

state of Gov. George W. Bush, the current front-runner for the
Republican presidential nomination, for a mix of official duties,
campaign fund raising and solidifying his political ties to
Hispanic voters, who are likely to be pivotal in the 2000
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's schedule also included an appearance Tuesday night at a
Hispanic Democratic Unity rally in McAllen, an indication of the
importance Gore is placing on the Hispanic vote in his presidential
bid. Bush won an unprecedented number of Hispanic votes in his
re-election campaign last year, although estimates vary from 40
percent to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's three-day trip, which began Monday in Florida and
Georgia, is expected to yield some $850,000 for his presidential
campaign following fund-raising events Wednesday in Dallas and
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics is like fighting a way, but you shoot money instead
of bullets,'' Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes said at a private fund-raiser
for Gore in Atlanta on Monday. ``If there's not enough money, you
get overwhelmed. If you can't get money, you don't get your message
out.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Isolated severe thunderstorms will erupt over parts of eastern
New Mexico and western Texas on Wednesday as an upper-level low
pressure system from Arizona teams with the high terrain of the
region to lift moist air streaming inland from the Gulf of Mexico.
Hail and tornadoes are possible in spots.
</P>
<P>
   Moderate to locally heavy rains will douse parts of northern and
central Texas as humid Gulf air is lifted over a stationary front
spanning from west to east across the Lone Star State. Another
mechanism for lifting Gulf air will be a small-scale boundary
marking the leading edge of rain-cooled air left in the wake of
morning clusters of showers and storms.
</P>
<P>
   Variable clouds with widely separated cool showers will prevail
from the eastern Great Lakes region to the northern and central
Appalachians as a sluggish, cold low pressure system at high
altitudes drifts overhead. Showers will jump eastward from the
mountains to parts of eastern Maine, which will lie closest to the
cold core of the upper-level low. Brisk winds from the
west-southwest will average 15 to 30 mph across much of the
Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Thunderstorms will flare over parts of the Carolinas and Georgia
as a compact but potent jet stream disturbance works in tandem with
a stalled front to lift moist air. Depending on the supply of Gulf
moisture, a few storms may approach severe levels. Large hail and
damaging winds are possible.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, isolated, potent thunderstorms will erupt over the
mountains of south-central Montana and northern Wyoming and then
move eastward. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Power of Water
</P>
<P>
   Three cars were washed away by relatively shallow flash-flood
waters at a crossing near San Angelo, Texas, on Monday. The power
of moving water should never being taken lightly _ a cube of water
measuring just one meter on each side weighs more than 2,000
pounds. Indeed, many deaths occur when motorists attempt to drive
their cars through flooded crossings and are carried rapidly away
by swift currents. The best rule to follow is to avoid driving
through any flooded areas. If this advice is not heeded and a car
stalls in flood waters, motorists should abandon their vehicles
immediately.  &QL;

INVESTIGATION INTO FATAL FALL FOCUSES ON WRESTLER'S HARNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RUTH E. IGOE and LYNN HORSELY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Professional wrestler Owen Hart had performed
the stunt before.
</P>
<P>
   Before Sunday night's World Wrestling Federation show at Kemper
Arena, the 34-year-old Hart practiced again. Cables strung from a
catwalk beneath the roof seemed taut. A harness was snug.
</P>
<P>
   But about 10 minutes before Hart, nicknamed the ``Blue Blazer,''
was scheduled to descend into the ring suspended from the cable, he
suddenly plunged about 80 feet to his death.
</P>
<P>
   Police investigators said Monday that Hart appeared to have lost
his balance, a misstep that started a still-unclear chain of lethal
events leading to the first known performance-related death at the
arena.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are zeroing in on the wrestler's body harness
attached to the cable, which did not break. The stunt harness had
been modified with a quick-release device that Hart could use to
free himself from the cable.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, police think, that quick release may have been
activated _ either accidentally or intentionally _ as Hart fell,
sending him crashing onto the ring below.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you are up there on a catwalk with ropes everywhere,
in the dark, 92 feet above the floor, things can happen,'' said
Kansas City Police Capt. Jerry Gallagher. ``When you are dealing
with triggers that can drop you from your harness, anything can
happen. Anything can fail.''
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy Monday revealed that Hart bled to death internally
from blunt chest trauma, said Jackson County Medical Examiner
Thomas Young.
</P>
<P>
   After the show, police interviewed all the people involved with
the stunt, said Sgt. Floyd Mitchell. A final report is pending.
</P>
<P>
   Hart's descent was supposed to be an added attraction for 16,340
attending the event _ called ``Over the Edge'' _ and hundreds of
thousands of fans watching on nationwide pay-per-view.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Yeaton, an event operations coordinator for the WWF's
Kansas City show, said the federation does about 300 shows a year.
Such stunts are an ``extra, extra addition,'' done about once a
month, mostly for pay-per-view shows.
</P>
<P>
   World Wrestling Federation officials, at their Stamford, Conn.,
headquarters, said Monday they are conducting their own
investigation into the accident.
</P>
<P>
   WWF officials said they did not know how many times Hart had
performed the stunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all devastated. He had a wonderful career. We are
concentrating on his family,' said spokeswoman Susan Warner.
</P>
<P>
   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration also is
looking into whether it has jurisdiction to investigate, said
Lodama Delinger, the Kansas City area director.
</P>
<P>
   An OSHA inquiry would take several months. OSHA's regional
office has not, to Delinger's knowledge, investigated the WWF or
Kemper Arena before.
</P>
<P>
   City policy allows ``proven professionals (using their own
equipment) to rappel from the Kemper catwalk,'' said Alan
Schmelzle, Kemper's general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Schmelzle said three men were on the catwalk at the time of the
accident, but that no city employees were involved in rigging the
stunt, Schmelzle said.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage
Employees Local 31 were hired by WWF for the show, said union
steward Jay Lewis. They joined WWF personnel already familiar with
the specific event equipment and stunts.
</P>
<P>
   Schmelzle said city officials would review their stunt policy at
Kemper, but he doubted there would be any changes. A prohibition on
rappelling would eliminate such events as circus acrobat acts at
Kemper.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a situation like this, we want to make sure nothing like
this ever happens again,'' Schmelzle said. ``To the best of my
knowledge, we have never had an incident like this...''
</P>
<P>
   Schmelzle praised the quick response of the ambulance workers
and police who tried to save Hart's life. He said it was standard
practice for the city to provide emergency rescue crews at events
such as the wrestling match.
</P>
<P>
   But spokesman Don Pickard of the Metropolitan Ambulance Services
Trust said records show that Sunday was the first time MAST had
been asked to attend a WWF event. Given the extensive preparations,
heavy choreography and staging of each scene, there's rarely a need
for ambulance personnel, Pickard said.
</P>
<P>
   Pickard said Kemper arena officials had requested that a MAST
crew stand by at the event Sunday to participate in a staged injury
with Vincent McMahon, the WWF chairman. The scene was filmed away
from the main stage.
</P>
<P>
   As the two-man ambulance crew finished the filming, Hart fell,
and they were called back in. They tried to save Hart's life,
without success. When the two men arrived on the scene, two police
officers were performing CPR.
</P>
<P>
   MAST crews then spent about 15 minutes attempting to resuscitate
Hart before taking him to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   John Sharp, executive director of MAST, said he believes MAST
should always be asked to stand by at wrestling matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever the city has an event that has an element of danger,
the city should require the promoter to require ambulances be
there,'' Sharp said. ``That would apply to everything from boxing
matches to monster trucks.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite some criticism, Schmelzle defended the wrestling
federation's decision to continue the show after the fall. He said
Hart's colleagues were deeply saddened, but their attitude was,
``The show must go on.''
</P>
<P>
   The WWF is scheduled to host another event at Kemper in August,
and Schmelzle said they are always welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are extremely popular,'' he said.

FEDERAL AGENCY'S STUDY OF SUGAR CREEK POLLUTION IS INCONCLUSIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MANSUR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Despite 10 years of investigation, regulators
still cannot tell whether pollution from the former Amoco refinery
in Sugar Creek poses any health risk to area residents, according
to the first federal health assessment of the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found nothing of an imminent concern _ that we know of,''
said Denise Jordan-Izaguirre, regional representative of the
federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry.
</P>
<P>
   The agency will take public comment on its draft report for 30
days.
</P>
<P>
   To plug data gaps, the federal health agency has recommended
many new tests _ including a new round of air sampling in homes in
the nearby Norledge neighborhood, where pollution from the old
refinery has migrated.
</P>
<P>
   Residents expressed dismay Monday that once again they had a
report that gave them no conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to know, yes or no,'' said Bud Chappell, who
initiated the federal health assessment. ``I just don't understand
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Chappell is a leader of a local group pushing for a quicker
cleanup of the former refinery site.
</P>
<P>
   New Mayor Stan Salva said he welcomed the new federal assessment
and found its recommendations understandable. But he, too, wished
for more answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd glad we have this,'' he said, ``but I don't think it
really answers any questions. And, maybe, these are questions we
can never answer.''
</P>
<P>
   The report cemented the position of Amoco and Sugar Creek
officials: There is no reason to believe residents are at risk from
any of the old refinery's pollution.
</P>
<P>
   But to a lawyer involved in recent litigation against Amoco, the
new assessment's indefinite finding is more evidence of a lack of
government action.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disconcerting that as the neighbors of Amoco have died or
been diagnosed with serious disease in the last 10 years, state and
federal regulators seemed at first to be asleep on the job and more
recently sleep-walking on the job,'' said Arthur A. Benson II, an
attorney for residents who own property under which Amoco's
pollution has seeped.
</P>
<P>
   Benson added that he hoped new testing conducted for litigation
against Amoco, as well as new studies of cancer rates in Sugar
Creek, would spark regulators to take more action.
</P>
<P>
   The new testing has shown high levels of pollutants in soil and
groundwater in the Norledge area, Benson said.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan-Izaguirre confirmed the new test data and said it
appeared to show that off-site pollution had moved farther than
previously thought.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Salva worries that the city's image is being unjustly
besmirched by the suspicions and prolonged investigation of the
site's pollution.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as residents of the city being safe, I feel that they
are,'' Salva said. ``I also believe that if Amoco had spent more
money (on the cleanup) we'd be further along.''
</P>
<P>
   It appears that the regulatory agencies recently have placed a
higher priority on achieving some cleanup, Salva added.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Casebolt, Amoco's site manager in Sugar Creek, said his
company thinks that neither on-site nor off-site contamination
poses a health threat to the neighborhood. ``But we're supportive
of any additional study,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry said Monday
it would hold a public hearing in Sugar Creek on June 2 to further
explain the study.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan-Izaguirre said the site is being cleaned up under a
federal program that tends to concentrate on pollution on site, not
off site. As a result, little testing data have been collected off
site.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Superfund program ranks sites based on their
potential to contaminate persons by polluting their groundwater,
drinking water or air. But the Amoco site is handled under another
federal hazardous waste program, known as RCRA, for the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act that created it.
</P>
<P>
   In its new health assessment, the Agency for Toxic Substances
and Disease Registry recommended that off-site soil be tested.
Residents, including Chappell, have long complained of a lack of
soil testing in their neighborhood. At one recent meeting, Chappell
argued there had been no soil testing in the residential area near
the old refinery, but state officials said he was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The study concluded there had been no soil testing before the
tests recently completed for Benson's firm.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency, the Missouri Department of
Natural Resources and Amoco plan further testing and
pollution-containing efforts this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The state will take new samples of surface water, Amoco will
sample anew its groundwater wells, and the EPA will sample basement
air quality in Norledge area homes. Similar, but less accurate,
sampling was conducted last year but was inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan-Izaguirre expressed frustration that her agency could not
say anything more than ``indeterminate.'' But she also promised
that her agency won't give up.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the first cut,'' she said. ``We are in no way
walking away from this.''

FCC PROPOSAL PITS RADIO GIANTS AGAINST MOM-AND-POP STATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In less than two years, the Federal Communications
Commission has chased about 480 tiny, unlicensed radio stations off
the dial as ``pirates'' of the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   But before the year is out, ex-pirates such as Rich Wenzel of
Lawrence and Michael Gonzalo Calderon of Kansas City could be back
on the air _ compliments of the FCC.
</P>
<P>
   In a little-publicized but testy conflict, the FCC is
considering whether to let thousands of small-time radio stations
set up shop in communities where big-time stations don't want them
around.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC bowed to pressure from commercial and public radio
giants to extend the public comment period on its proposal until
August. Big broadcasters are doing studies on how small stations
interfere with their reception.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the delay could work in favor of small stations by
giving supporters more time to sway the FCC and lobby Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've heard from the money; now the consumers and the people
who don't normally come forward will have their voices heard,''
said Michael Bracy, executive director of the Low Power Radio
Coalition. ``It should be fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Bracy said low-power radio is an important outlet for many
Americans, such as musicians who can't get played on bigger
stations, youngsters trying to break into broadcasting and scores
of ordinary people who have something to say.
</P>
<P>
   Wenzel likens community radio to the town halls of America,
where views are aired on subjects as weighty as world politics and
as light as dating tips for teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Miller, who had a show on Wenzel's station, said
``decentralizing'' the media is the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a relentless move toward centralization....It's
sad,'' said Miller, chairman of the Department of Religious Studies
at the University of Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   The technology of some of the small stations can be crude. For
example, Miller said, callers to his talk show could be heard on
the air only if he held the phone to the microphone.
</P>
<P>
   Wenzel's 10-watt FM station operated out of the basement of
Liberty Hall in Lawrence for about 15 months until June. It had a
radius of about five miles. The station was on the air 12 hours a
day and had 100 disc jockeys a week, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Calderon didn't have that kind of help at his station, which he
ran by himself at his Kansas City home. When he was at work as a
bondsman, Calderon said, he would cue up compact discs and come
home at lunch to change them.
</P>
<P>
   The 60-watt, 20-mile-radius station broadcast in Spanish for the
Hispanic community before the FCC shut it down.
</P>
<P>
   ``They created a lie that I was interfering with a 100,000-watt
station,'' Calderon said. ``I was approached the wrong way: `Get
off the air, you're interfering.' I was wondering where my
government was.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission voted 4-1 on Jan. 28 to consider issuing licenses
to community stations of 1 to 1,000 watts. Normally, 6,000 watts is
a prerequisite for a license.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we traveled the country, we've talked to lots of people who
want to use the airways to speak to their communities _ churches,
elementary schools, universities, small businesses and minority
groups,'' FCC Chairman William Kennard and Commissioner Gloria
Tristani said in a statement at the time.
</P>
<P>
   But there is some concern that low-watt stations would also give
greater airway access to people who want to spread racism and hate.
The FCC can't censor points of view but does have regulations on
material that is offensive or could incite violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not want to deny schools, churches and civic
organizations a voice on the airwaves, but we are not particularly
excited about giving the David Dukes of the world a platform
either,'' said Ken Johnson, a spokesman for U.S. Rep. Billy Tauzin,
a Republican from Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Tauzin, chairman of the House Telecommunications Commission,
would like committee hearings on the low-power radio issue.
Congress could override the FCC decision.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC set a public comment deadline of April 12, extended it
to May 12, then extended it until Aug. 2 at the request of the
National Association of Broadcasters, the Corporation for Public
Broadcasting and National Public Radio.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC had more than 13,000 inquiries last year from people and
groups interested in starting low-power radio stations. The FCC
hasn't determined how licensees will be chosen, but both
noncommercial and commercial stations may be approved, spokesman
David Fiske said.
</P>
<P>
   People like Wenzel and Calderon could be prevented from getting
licenses because they operated illegally previously, but that also
hasn't been decided, Fiske said.
</P>
<P>
   FCC Commissioner Harold W. Furchtgott-Roth said he wasn't sure
the FCC would accomplish one of its goals _ to put more minorities
and women in the radio business.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is simply no way that the commission can say these
licenses will not be awarded to whoever applies for them first...or
that these licenses will not go to the highest bidder,'' said
Furchtgott-Roth, the only commissioner opposed to the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Broadcasters believes the FCC
doesn't have enough data to be assured that low-watt stations won't
dilute the signals of much larger stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're basically saying, `Before you know what is going to
happen, don't move forward,' '' spokesman John Earnhardt said.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress have been taking sides. Five members of the
House wrote Kennard a letter of support in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tremendous public demand for microradio is demonstrated by
the proliferation of illegal radio stations, whose operators
broadcast at the risk of financial losses and, in some cases,
imprisonment,'' the lawmakers wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Tauzin, however, wrote a letter to Kennard urging caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge policy decision,'' Tauzin aide Johnson said.
``Billy told Kennard in no uncertain terms that he is not to
proceed with microstations without consulting Congress.''

GOVERNMENT ACCUSES MEDICAL CENTER, RELATED COMPANY OF BILKING
MEDICAID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK MORRIS and JULIUS A. KARASH  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The U.S. Justice Department has accused
Truman Medical Center and a related company of bilking Medicaid by
providing substandard pre-natal care to poor Kansas City women and
billing the government for more expensive services that never were
provided.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Stephen Hill said a civil lawsuit filed Monday
would expose ``more than 100'' false Medicaid claims filed since
1993 by Truman and by Hospital Hill Health Services Corp., a
non-profit company that hires the hospital's physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Each false filing could carry a $10,000 penalty, bringing
potential damages to $1 million. In addition, a jury could force
the hospital to pay interest, attorneys' fees, restitution and
triple damages for monetary losses to the government.
</P>
<P>
   Truman and Hospital Hill ``systematically chose to profit by not
providing patients the level of Medicaid treatment to which they
were entitled,'' Hill said. ``Our purpose in bringing this action
is to improve health care to the indigent in Kansas City.''
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement, James Youngblood, chairman of the
hospital's obstetrics and gynecology department, defended the care
the hospital and its doctors provided to pregnant women and their
babies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clinical care administered by professionals at Truman
Medical Center is consistently high and has not been compromised,''
Youngblood said. ``Qualified and licensed providers gave
appropriate and necessary care to patients and delivered
approximately 15,000 babies over the last six years. We continue to
provide the high quality of care expected by Kansas Citians.''
</P>
<P>
   Youngblood suggested that the complexities of Medicaid billing
may have led to Hill's questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government's complaint appears to arise over technical
Medicaid billing and documentation issues that are subject to
interpretation,'' Youngblood said. ``This action will be referred
to our attorneys. (Hospital Hill) and Truman Medical Center deny
the allegations and will vigorously defend this action.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill said prosecutors declined to file criminal charges against
the hospital and the physicians group, reasoning that conviction
would bar the hospital from receiving further federal aid and force
it to close. About 78 percent of the hospital's revenue comes from
either Medicare, the country's health insurance program for the
elderly, or Medicaid, the indigent health care program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The forced closing of Truman would be a monumentally tragic
event,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   FBI Special Agent Larry McCormick said a criminal investigation
announced two months ago of the hospital's Medicare and Medicaid
billing practices is continuing. Hill would not rule out criminal
charges being filed against individuals in the latest case.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is always the potential for individuals to be held
criminally liable,'' Hill said. ``That is still a potential here.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill said evidence in the case would show two general types of
``purposeful, sustained and intentional'' billing fraud:
</P>
<P>
   - Instances in which the hospital and the corporation received
reimbursement from Medicaid for services that either were never
provided to low-income pregnant women or were delivered in a way
that did not meet Medicaid standards.
</P>
<P>
   - Occasions in which the hospital and corporation billed for
deliveries by Medicaid-approved physicians, when the deliveries
were performed by medical students, nurses or doctors who were not
enrolled in the program.
</P>
<P>
   In the first instance, Hill accused Truman and the doctors group
of ``ripping off'' a program designed to encourage regular
pre-natal visits by pregnant women with the same physician.
</P>
<P>
   In that program, a doctor is reimbursed $550 if a pregnant woman
receives five check-ups from the same physician before she gives
birth. The idea is to give physicians an incentive to provide
regular and consistent pre-natal care for women who already are at
risk for difficult pregnancies, Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   If the woman has fewer than five visits, or meets with a
different physician each time, the physician may only be reimbursed
for $17 per appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said the investigation found few instances of physicians
billing at the $17 rate, even though other evidence showed women
often met with different doctors.
</P>
<P>
   In the second allegation, Truman physicians who had been
approved as Medicaid providers allegedly signed reimbursement
paperwork showing they had delivered infants, when the deliveries
were actually performed by unsupervised medical students, nurses or
doctors who were not enrolled in the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't bill for a service when the truth of the matter is
someone else is providing those services,'' Hill said. ``The
defendants had a clear understanding of Medicaid policies, but
deliberately chose to ignore them.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Hill nor McCormick would speculate as to how common
either of the billing problems noted in Kansas City are at other
public hospitals in the United States. The government, however,
estimates that 10 to 25 percent of the more than $150 billion paid
out by Medicaid each year is lost to fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's action by the federal government was the second time in
little more than two months that fraud allegations have surfaced at
Truman.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Truman and Hospital Hill Health Services doctors group
agreed to pay the federal government $242,500 to settle allegations
of Medicare fraud.
</P>
<P>
   That settlement involved allegedly fraudulent billings for tests
performed on elderly and low-income patients.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations of fraud are occurring as Truman, which serves
as Kansas City's and Jackson County's public hospital system, is
straining to achieve a financial turnaround under John Bluford, who
took over as executive director and chief executive officer in
March.
</P>
<P>
   The government said the alleged wrongdoings at Truman took place
since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital system, which includes Truman Medical Center
campuses on Hospital Hill and on Lee's Summit Road, was flush with
Medicaid payments a few years ago. But Truman has been staggered by
the new financial demands of managed care and now is scrounging to
break even.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's action by the federal government is the latest
development in a years-long crusade by federal and state
governments against health-care fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid is a joint federal-state program that provides health
care for several groups of indigent persons, including low-income
pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
   According to the latest figures available, Medicaid serves about
37 million people in the United States, including about 728,000 in
Missouri and 235,000 in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Government regulators say they are rooting out fraud in Medicaid
and Medicare to save taxpayers money and keep those programs alive.
</P>
<P>
   But some health providers and their defenders say the crusade
has become overly zealous.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Wade, a spokesman for the American Hospital Association
in Washington, said the latest case against Truman sounded like an
exercise in ``micromanagement'' by regulators who are ``out of
touch with how patients get care.''
</P>
<P>
   He said such actions not only create confusion but also
demoralize people who work in hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government's thrust is there is some malevolent intent,
that the hospitals are out to defraud the government, and that's
not the case,'' Wade said.
</P>
<P>
   John Leifer, an Overland Park health-care consultant, said there
is a danger that people will jump to conclusions in wake of the
charges against Truman and the doctors' group.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the current atmosphere of distrust and allegations, it's
easy to convince the public of the institution's guilt before due
process has occurred,'' Leifer said. ``I hope that people withhold
judgment in this case until all the facts are in.''

 &HT;    South Africa prepares to take another step on the long walk to
freedom
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ In the crowds that swell through
the modern walkways of the East Gate mall on the outskirts of
Johannesburg, between the jewelry shops and the clothing stores,
between the music shops, the toy stores and the Chick-Fil-A, black
people and white people mingle freely.
</P>
<P>
   They browse the same windows, work behind the same counters, eat
at the same restaurants and share the same taxis.
</P>
<P>
   Five years after South Africa's first all-race elections
propelled the country's first black-led government to power _ and
ended the official policy of racial oppression known as apartheid _
relations between whites and blacks are more relaxed and less
fractious than almost anyone could have predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've forgiven them,'' said Bennie Makololo, 34, a black man
who sells security fences in Alexandra, an area of Johannesburg.
``Black people are not angry at whites.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that it was a miracle,'' said Danie van den Heever,
47, a white businessman who is an eighth-generation South African.
``There's a reconciliation of South Africans who are able to
communicate, to share their desires, to share their concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all is rosy between the races, of course: Some white racism
lingers, and so does some black anger. But the predicted bloodbath
never came; whites with money and property were not overrun by
black mobs, as they had feared; and radicalism among both blacks
and whites has declined.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, as big a relief as that transformation has been, the
country still faces enormous challenges. Violent crime is as
pervasive as anywhere in the world. Most blacks are still very
poor, and economic power remains concentrated in the hands of the
white minority. Unemployment, which primarily affects blacks, is
estimated at 38 percent. And while schools in some white areas
would be the envy of Cobb County, the educational system in many
black areas _ which is to say, most of the country _ is in
desperate straits. Schools lack electricity, books, qualified
teachers and adequate facilities.
</P>
<P>
   On June 2, one week from today, voters will go to the polls to
choose a successor to President Nelson Mandela, the man who emerged
from 27 years in prison to become chief architect of the country's
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   Most will do so in the full knowledge that South Africa, a
country basking in the glow of one miracle, desperately needs yet
another. The transformation the country must make now is not
emotional but economic.
</P>
<P>
   Most political observers feel certain that the election will be
won by the African National Congress. It is, after all, the party
of Mandela _ a man who, to many black South Africans, is nothing
less than George Washington and Martin Luther King Jr. rolled into
one.
</P>
<P>
   If so, the new president will be Thabo Mbeki, a 57-year-old
British-educated economist. He is the son of Govan Mbeki, a
journalist and activist who served time in prison with Mandela.
Thabo Mbeki has been deputy president since 1996, and over the past
couple of years, as Mandela has concentrated on the overarching
message of reconciliation, Mbeki has run the country's day-to-day
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela turned out to be perfectly suited to working the miracle
of reconciliation. A former prisoner, he forgave his captors. As
president, he shared lunch with the prosecutor who succeeded in
getting him sentenced to life in prison. He paid a courtesy call to
Betsie Verwoerd, the widow of Hendrik Verwoerd, the main designer
of apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some South Africans think _ or hope, at any rate _ that
Mbeki will be better suited than Mandela to the difficult and
technical tasks of reviving the economy, reducing unemployment,
curtailing crime and reforming education. While he lacks Mandela's
instinct for the grand gesture, he earned a master's in economics
from Sussex University in England, and he is a suave and
sophisticated politician who has promoted the idea of a
continentwide ``African renaissance'' based on economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   The only question most South African election-watchers have is
whether the ANC will win the two-thirds majority in Parliament that
would allow it to amend the constitution without relying on the
votes of opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents, aware that their chances of victory are slender at
best, have urged voters to hold the ANC parliamentary membership
below two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a party that has too much power inevitably abuses
it,'' said veteran anti-apartheid activist Helen Suzman, a member
of the Democratic Party _ and a friend of Mandela's.
</P>
<P>
   The ANC received 62.6 percent of the vote when it won power in
the election of 1994 and formed a government of national unity with
the National Party, which was the party of apartheid, and the
Zulu-oriented Inkatha Freedom Party. The National Party withdrew
from the coalition in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   If the ANC wins again, the reason will be more than just
residual goodwill toward Mandela and gratitude toward the party
that negotiated the end of apartheid. Beyond the freedom to live,
travel, shop and use the same rest rooms as whites, some blacks in
South Africa have seen small _ but noticeable _ improvements in
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Muriel Maseko, for example, lives in a squatter camp in Soweto,
the black township southwest of Johannesburg. Pitted roads splay
out between rows of makeshift shacks built of scraps of corrugated
iron. There is no plumbing; residents must use portable toilets the
government has placed along the roadsides every four or five
houses.
</P>
<P>
   Yet to Maseko this bit of squalor might as well be heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Before she moved here a couple of years ago and built a house
herself, Maseko, 66, was homeless. She lived in a shelter, crammed
into a single room with dozens of other people.
</P>
<P>
   Now she has four rooms, and she shares them with only two other
people _ her daughter and randdaughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing quite a lot better,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Had she built before the end of apartheid, she said, her house _
and, indeed, the entire squatter camp _ could well have fallen
before government bulldozers.
</P>
<P>
   Another person who is doing better is Emma Mhlongo, a
37-year-old mother of four who lives in Ebony Park, a neighborhood
of small, cinderblock houses east of Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
   Mhlongo lives in one of the homes _ new houses the government
has built in an effort to improve the lives of the millions of
black South Africans who are landless.
</P>
<P>
   The house is far too small for a family of six. But it's solid,
and it has running water. It's an improvement over Mhlongo's
previous circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to be in the squatter camp down the road,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For those who used to be homeless, the right to live unmolested
in a squatter camp is a step up. For those who were already in
squatter camps, the right to own government-built houses, however
small and boxy, is a step up from that.
</P>
<P>
   According to the ANC, the government has, in the last five
years, brought running water to 3 million people, housed nearly 3
million people, connected 2 million households to electricity, and
transferred ownership of some land to 68,000 households.
</P>
<P>
   That may not seem like much in a country of 43.4 million people
where the majority remain impoverished. But it is something.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are steadily but surely starting to dent the massive
inequalities and poverty created by apartheid,'' says the ANC's
election manifesto. ``It is only by overcoming the huge
inequalities in our society that we shall be able to build a truly
non-racial democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent conversations, many black South Africans expressed
strong support for the ANC, even though the tasks ahead loom large.
Five years, they said, is a brief time in the life of the country,
and the government has been operating under constraints.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our government is doing a lot for us, '' Maseko said. ``Our
government has actually done its utmost best to improve our lives.
We have plenty of privileges, but the government does not have
enough funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she gets 500 rands a month _ about $83 _ as an old-age
pension, where before she got nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we don't starve any more,'' she said. ``And I'm free! I've
got a home in a squatter camp!''
</P>
<P>
   John Masinga, 46, a black man who runs a roadside exhaust-system
repair stand _ nothing more, really, than himself and a beat up
wooden table sitting among the exhaust fumes along the side of a
road north of Pretoria _ said people have to be patient with the
ANC.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some changes,'' he said. ``If it were not for the
ANC, I wouldn't be able to do this work. The government would send
some police to push me away. The ANC has done a lot, but we cannot
expect all the changes overnight. A small child cannot just be born
and on the same day walk.''
</P>
<P>
   But support for the ANC among blacks is not universal.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, there has not been any change,'' said Jacob Letshwene,
pastor of the St. Phillip Apostolic Church in the town of Mabopane,
outside Pretoria. ``People are jobless, and the crime rate is very
high. I am totally disappointed. Unfortunately, I voted for the ANC
in 1994.''
</P>
<P>
   Letshwene, in his late 50s, strolled the dirt streets of his
town in vest, tie and snap-brim straw hat. He said he will vote
this time for the United Christian Democratic Party. That is the
party of Lucas Mangope, the former president of Bophuthatswana,
which was this area's version of the theoretically independent
homelands, or Bantustans, into which the apartheid government tried
to herd the country's blacks.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Bantustans were not independent but had
considerable support from the apartheid government. All were
reabsorbed into South Africa upon apartheid's demise.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other parties likely to receive noticeable support are
the Inkatha Freedom Party, built around the Zulu politician
Mangosuthu Buthelezi; the New National Party, the reincarnation of
the party that once created apartheid; the Pan Africanist Congress,
a black party more radical than the ANC; the Democratic Party, a
party of white liberals that is the successor to the Progressive
Party founded by Helen Suzman, the veteran anti-apartheid
politician; and the United Democratic Movement, led, oddly enough,
by a black former member of the anti-apartheid ANC and a white
former member of the pro-apartheid National Party.
</P>
<P>
   The membership of some of those parties shows that, despite the
ethnic reconciliation that South Africa has achieved in the last
five years, this is still a society divided by tribe and race. The
Inkatha Freedom Party is largely Zulu. The United Christian
Democratic Party, with geographically limited appeal, is mostly
Tswana. The Democratic Party and the New National Party are almost
exclusively white.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who doubts the fractured nature of South Africa should
consider this: This is a country with 11 official languages.
</P>
<P>
   And the divisions between the four racial groups imposed on the
country by the system of apartheid _ whites, Indians, coloreds and
blacks _ still persist. Those divisions, some say, will persist far
into the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take a thousand years before we come together,'' said
Patrick Singh, 50, an Afro-Asian who classifies himself colored and
lives in a predominantly colored neighborhood of Johannesburg.
``The hate is still there.''
</P>
<P>
   The country may be quiet, but this is the calm before the storm,
Singh said. Sooner or later, he said, violence will sweep over
South Africa in response to white insistence on holding onto
economic power.
</P>
<P>
   The disparities in wealth between whites and blacks are very
stark.
</P>
<P>
   While many blacks live in squatter camps, or in extremely small
and modest houses, many white people in the northern suburbs of
Johannesburg, for example, drive Mercedes, work in fashionable
offices complexes, and live in posh homes in upscale First-World
neighborhoods. The northern suburbs of Johannesburg have been
reported to have the world's greatest concentration of swimming
pools outside of Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   And while some whites seem free of racism _ Marian Karsden, a
22-year-old mall store manager said she will vote for the
Zulu-oriented Inkatha Freedom Party _ among others, racism and
condescension still linger.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing wrong with having black people in government,
but I don't think they value life the same as white people,'' said
Cobie Schoeman, a 45-year-old clerk who lives in Pretoria with her
young daughter. ``I could be wrong, but I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, sentences recently imposed in two different
criminal cases convinced many black South Africans that the justice
system remains racist.
</P>
<P>
   On March 23, Nicholas Steyn, a white man who was convicted of
shooting a six-month-old baby girl to death as her cousin carried
her across Steyn's property, received a suspended sentence. The
next day, longtime anti-apartheid activist Allan Boesak, a black
man who was convicted of diverting charitable donations for poor
children to his personal use, was sentenced to six years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, relations between blacks and whites seem, overall,
to be on the mend. But relations between blacks, who make up 75
percent of the population, and coloreds, or mixed race people, who
make up 9 percent, tend to be hostile.
</P>
<P>
   Some blacks stereotype coloreds as foul-mouthed heavy drinkers
who think they're better than blacks because they're lighter. Some
coloreds stereotype blacks as racists every bit as virulent as the
whites who used to run this country.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a sizable number of coloreds _ many of whom speak
Afrikaans but few of whom speak speak Zulu _ plan to vote for the
New National Party next month. They say they were discriminated
against before by whites, they're being discriminated against now
by blacks, so they might as well vote for the party than can keep
order, manage the economy and quell crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were better off in South Africa when the National Party
was ruling, so I think I'll vote for the National Party,'' said
Denver Isaacs, a 24-year-old unemployed colored resident of
Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
   How in the world can a colored man vote for the party of
apartheid?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good question,'' Isaacs said. ``When the National Party
was in power, it was unfair. But now that the ANC is in, it is even
more unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   Sophia Wallenstein, 70, a retired factory worker who is colored,
said she has supported the National Party all her life _ and a
return to apartheid would be better than the current chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ``That time under the National Party was 100 percent better,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Such racial divisiveness might seem discouraging. Yet, amid all
the prejudice, poverty and crime, seeds of hope are beginning to
grow.
</P>
<P>
   In Mabopane, outside Pretoria, Nomzi Mashiane, a retired nurse,
used to drive every day by a large plot of unused city-owned land
that had become a dumping ground. Mashiane had worked in nutrition,
and one day it occurred to her: This land could be used to help
unemployed people earn money growing vegetables. And the vegetables
could improve people's diets.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, she got permission from the city to use the land
and began to organize people in the area to sell them on the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought that I was a bit looney,'' she said. ``They
thought that this would never work _ especially in an urban area.''
</P>
<P>
   But now the land is tilled by 53 people, most of them elderly.
Rows of spinach, cabbage, beets, onions, eggplant, beans, red
peppers and carrots sprout from the fertile earth.
</P>
<P>
   The people who work the plot keep some of the food for
themselves. The rest of the food is marketed in Pretoria, and those
who work the land share the profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, unemployed people do need some sense of pride,''
said Mashiane, who is 63. ``And better nutrition.''
</P>
<P>
   The project is a success largely because of Mashiane's energy
and initiative, and the diligent work of the jobless people
involved. But there was another crucial ingredient.
</P>
<P>
   Mashiane approached the department of agriculture of the
Northwest Province and convinced officials to give the project a
grant of 411,000 rands _ about $67,000 _ to install an irrigation
system. Taps protrude from the ground every 20 or 25 feet, ready to
water the vegetables and keep them healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Without this government grant, which could never have happened
under apartheid, Mashiane said, the project could never have
succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   The ANC-led government of South Africa still faces problems _
huge unemployment, rising crime, schools with no electricity or
textbooks _ that would daunt the most capable leaders in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But, to some people at least, the government appears to be
trying. And the small differences it has managed to make in the
lives of at least some of its people may well be enough to ensure
that it gets a second five years to try to address those problems.
</P>
<P>
   Esther Mashubuku, a 24-year-old who now owns one of the new
government-built houses in Ebony park, said she will vote for the
ANC. Definitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the house because of voting,'' she said. ``Next time
maybe I will get a car.''

 In sign of confidence, S. Korea Telecom Shares Will Begin Trading  
(dal) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ One of the surest signs that South Korea has won back
the confidence of international investors will show up on Wednesday
when shares of Korea Telecom, the country's leading telephone
carrier, begin trading for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to sell $2.5 billion worth of stock, the first
equity deal in South Korea to exceed $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   It could have sold upward of $10 billion worth, said Alok Sama,
head of the high-technology and telecommunications group for Asia
at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, which is underwriting the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The largest equity offering to come out of South Korea
previously was by the Korea Electric Power Co., widely known as
Kepco, which raised $655 million in March.
</P>
<P>
   Kepco and Korea Telecom are among the 11 state-owned companies
that the South Korean government selected for privatization after
the country's economic collapse in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year ago, Sama said, Morgan Stanley would have
encountered trouble coaxing investors into swallowing $600 million
worth of Korea Telecom stock, but times have changed. ``Korea is
the flavor of the month, flavor of the year, whatever you want to
call it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the offering was helped by the large quantities of
investor cash sloshing around the globe, which has pushed even the
depressed Japanese stock market to double-digit gains this year.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, shares of telephone companies have outperformed most
stock indices this year. Demand for wireless communications
capacities like mobile telephones and wireless data transmission is
huge and growing in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have mildly criticized the company for changing
some of its corporate accounting policies in such a way as to
improve its operating profits. But the changes Korea Telecom made
were within those allowed by local regulations and were disclosed
in the company's prospectus. In addition, although some of the
changes would not be acceptable under U.S. accounting standards,
similar practices are used by telephone carriers elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Sama took issue with the suggestion that any accounting changes
had inflated earnings, pointing to Korea Telecom's acceleration of
depreciation charges on some assets and other restructuring
charges. ``If anything, earnings have been artificially
depressed,'' he said, ``and in any case, earnings aren't what
people are looking at.''
</P>
<P>
   He said investors were more interested in what price the stock
would be as a multiple of its cash flow, which is considered by
some to be a more important measure of value.

TELECOM ITALIA CEO AND BOARD RESIGN IN WAKE OF OLIVETTI VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ The chief executive and board of Telecom Italia SpA
resigned Tuesday in the aftermath of their defeat against rival
Olivetti in the recent battle for control of the telecommunications
giant.
</P>
<P>
   The resignations of Franco Bernabe and the directors had been
widely expected, but Bernabe became the first top executive
casualty since the three-month brawl for control of Telecom Italia
ended last Friday, when Olivetti won 51.9 percent of the company's
shares in a tender offer.
</P>
<P>
   Bernabe, who had fought Olivetti with a range of defensive
tactics that included a widely criticized proposal of acquisition
by Deutsche Telekom, Germany's dominant carrier, said he and the
other directors would stay on as caretakers until replacements are
chosen at a shareholder meeting June 28.
</P>
<P>
   Olivetti's effort, in the largest hostile takeover ever in
Europe, succeeded when key Telecom Italia shareholders defected on
the last day of the $65 billion offer in cash and securities.
</P>
<P>
   The Telecom Italia share price seesawed Tuesday amid investor
skittishness about the company's prospects under new management.
After falling almost 3 percent Monday and sliding 2.7 percent
further at the start of trading Tuesday, Telecom Italia's shares,
which accounted for more than half the trading in Milan on Tuesday,
recovered to close up 1.7 percent, but only after heavy buying by
Italian institutional investors. The company's savings shares,
which have no voting rights, dropped for second day, closing down
2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Olivetti's victory also hurt Deutsche Telekom shares, which fell
5.2 percent in Frankfurt on Tuesday. Deutsche Telekom's main
domestic rival, Mannesmann AG, gained almost 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Telecom Italia shareholders meeting in June is expected to
choose a new board to set company policy and to name new
management. Olivetti chief executive Roberto Colaninno, 55, is
likely to succeed Bernabe. The company is expected to retain the
name Telecom Italia and its shares to trade separately.
</P>
<P>
   For Colaninno, Tuesday was a day for making visits in Rome,
underscoring the deal's heavy political trappings. After meeting
Tuesday morning with aides of Italian Prime Minister Massimo
D'Alema, Colaninno talked with Industry Minister Pierluigi Bersani
and union leaders to discuss plans for the future of Telecom
Italia. The company, a former state monopoly, is facing its fourth
management turnover since it was taken public in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Bersani said after the meeting that the Italian government would
decide whether to approve the takeover before the June 28
shareholder meeting. The government holds a 3.4 percent stake in
Telecom Italia with veto rights, though approval is considered
virtually certain.
</P>
<P>
   `'We want to follow this affair in its evolution,'' Bersani told
reporters. Telecommunications, he said, was a crucial business
``not only for employees and phone users, but also for the
country's industrial prospects.''
</P>
<P>
   Bersani was evasive on the issue of job cuts. Rather than
discussing layoffs, he said, ``It's necessary to talk about
organization, which means naturally also facing significant
interventions, but such as are reached through dialogue with the
social forces and designed to make the company more efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Olivetti has said it expects to cut nearly 20,000 jobs at
Telecom Italia.

GANDHI RETURNS TO LEAD THE CONGRESS PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Sonia Gandhi, the Italian-born heiress to an
Indian dynasty, made a triumphant return Tuesday as leader of the
political party that has ruled the nation for most of the last half
century and is now trying to regain power.
</P>
<P>
   Her followers, who came by bus, train and plane from across
India, cheered and chanted in ecstatic celebration.
</P>
<P>
   A combative, impassioned Mrs. Gandhi, who quit as president of
the Congress Party only a week ago after three party leaders
opposed her prime ministerial candidacy because of her foreign
birth, said an outpouring of support from the party's members had
persuaded her to withdraw her resignation.
</P>
<P>
   In a voice choked with feeling, Mrs. Gandhi, 52, staked her
claim to being an Indian patriot. The country adopted her 31 her
ago when she married Rajiv Gandhi, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She recalled the assassinations of her mother-in-law, Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi, in 1984 and her husband, a former prime
minister who was only 46 when he was slain in 1991. And she
witheringly noted that the same three men who now raised questions
about her Italian origins had only a year earlier asked her to head
the Congress Party, then in a slow dance toward oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I became a wife here, a mother here, a widow here, too, right
before your eyes,'' she said, speaking in Hindi. ``The greatest
daughter of this country, Indiraji, breathed her last in my arms.
Every drop of blood in me says this country is mine. This country
is mine.''
</P>
<P>
   She defiantly said she would not reply to those who have
questioned her patriotism. She was apparently alluding to critics
who have asked why she waited until she had been in India 15 years
before she became a citizen and suggested that she may never have
renounced her Italian citizenship (a charge her friends say is
false).
</P>
<P>
   ``The people will give a resounding reply to that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining her resignation, Mrs. Gandhi said she had felt
hurt and betrayed when the three men, who had supported her as
president of the party, publicly opposed having anyone other than a
native Indian serve as prime minister. They sought to sow doubts
about her loyalty to India in her followers' minds, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that this whole fight is mine alone,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the people who have flocked to her residence from all over
the country in the last week convinced her she was far from alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to come to know who my true friends are,'' she said.
``You have again revived my hopes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not let you down.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gandhi arrived at the packed Talkatora Stadium, where
hundreds of members of the All India Congress Committee, a national
body of Congress members, had been waiting for her for an hour and
a half. Thousands of her supporters milled around outside, and
everyone who entered the stadium was searched.
</P>
<P>
   Security precautions delayed her arrival. Congress Party
officials say the government has warned Mrs. Gandhi recently of
threats on her life. The Hindu, a sober, English-language daily,
reported today that the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, a Sri
Lankan rebel group, were suspected of plotting to kill her. The
same group was implicated in her husband's assassination.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gandhi, whose friends fear for her safety now that she is
in politics, did not renounce the possibility that she will be
prime minister if the Congress Party wins in general elections in
September and October against its archrival, the Hindu nationalist
Bharatiya Janata Party.
</P>
<P>
   The Congress members elected to parliament would chose the prime
minister, she said. She did not need to add that they would surely
pick her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now nobody will dare go against her because the grass roots
are with her,'' said Ajay Singh, a Congress assemblyman from the
state of Haryana.
</P>
<P>
   The rage of the audience against the three Congressmen who
challenged her was palpable. The three, led by Sharad Pawar, a
powerful politician from the western state of Maharashtra, were
expelled from the party last week and say they will soon form a new
political party.
</P>
<P>
   When a Congress Party official from Maharashtra, Ranjit
Deshmukh, added a respectful ``ji'' to the end of Pawar's name
while delivering his speech, shouts of protest rose from the
audience. No ``ji'' for Pawar, they demanded. Only when Deshmukh
called the three men traitors did the crowd roar its approval.
</P>
<P>
   The stadium, both inside and out, was strung with banners and
decorated with billboards. ``No Soniaji. No Congress,'' said one.
``For the Sake of the Motherland, Soniaji, Please Come Back,'' said
another.
</P>
<P>
   A larger-than-life likeness of Mrs. Gandhi, clad in a sari,
loomed benevolently over the stadium floor, packed with Congress
men and women dressed in khadi, the white homespun cotton that is
their usual garb.
</P>
<P>
   When she finally arrived on the stage, where dozens of
high-ranking Congress officials sat cross-legged on white pillows,
chants of ``Sonia Gandhi, Zinzabad!'' or ``Long Live Sonia
Gandhi!'' rocked the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   From the dais, she waved to the audience, and it waved back to
her.
</P>
<P>
   A parade of speakers then swore their allegiance to her, each
more extravagant than the last.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wherever your sweat falls,'' vowed Subash Chopra, president of
the Delhi Congress Committee, ``we Congressmen will sacrifice our
blood.''

LOCKYER DENIES ROLE IN DECISION TO DROP PROBE OF PROSECUTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT WINOKUR  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ State Attorney General Bill Lockyer had ``no
personal knowledge'' of a decision by his office to drop an
investigation into possible criminal misappropriation of funds by
the office of San Francisco District Attorney Terence Hallinan,
Lockyer's spokesman says.
</P>
<P>
   Lockyer recently endorsed Hallinan, a fellow Democrat, in the
district attorney's bid for re-election this fall. But Lockyer's
spokesman, Nathan Barankin, said ``political calculations'' had not
entered into the abbreviated investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Hallinan's office improperly advanced $5,000 in salary to his
cousin, assistant district attorney Michael Hallinan, and misspent
an additional $1,800 on a Christmas party, according to an
unreleased audit by the San Francisco controller's office.
</P>
<P>
   Although the money was repaid, violations of both the city's
Administrative Code and the state Penal Code may have occurred,
legal sources said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Terence Hallinan last week acknowledged the
error in spending money for the Christmas party, but denied that
the $5,000 paid to Michael Hallinan was improper, saying that it
was unpaid salary.
</P>
<P>
   A state government source said that investigators believed
misappropriation of funds possibly had occurred, but noted that
investigators in San Francisco had received instructions from
Sacramento to drop the case.
</P>
<P>
   Barankin confirmed that investigators for the attorney general
had, in fact, looked into the matter, but their supervisors in
Sacramento determined the case didn't meet the attorney general's
standards for further investigation and possible prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the evidence we received, it was not in any way clear to
the persons who make these assessments that there was enough,''
Barankin said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the decision to drop the matter was based in part on
consultations with ``people outside'' the attorney general's office
``who are familiar with the (San Francisco) DA's office.'' He
declined to identify those people.
</P>
<P>
   ``In assessing whether to proceed with a criminal prosecution,
against a San Francisco DA or a homeless man,'' Barankin added,
``it is incumbent upon the prosecutor _ or, in this case, the
attorney general's office _ to make sure you have a chance to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Misappropriation of public funds is a felony punishable by
removal from office and up to four years in prison.

see-through gown; Rosie O'Donnell attacking Tom (``I am the NRA'')
Selleck; and Jennifer Anniston with a Magic Marker moustache on
``Friends.''
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing we haven't seen is a big, rousing Broadway
number, the kind that used to be mandatory as a curtain-closer back
in the golden age of American musicals.
</P>
<P>
   And who better to provide a big Broadway-style number to bring
down the curtain on May sweeps than ... Drew Carey? The burr-cut,
beer-loving comic who used to call himself The Human Cartoon?
</P>
<P>
   In case you haven't been paying attention, ``The Drew Carey
Show'' has been doing more with music than any other prime-time
series except ``Ally McBeal.'' They've done lip-syncing,
choreographed dancing, and spotlighted former Eagles guiatrist Joe
Walsh. But tonight they take it all the way home with a
show-stopping version of ``Brotherhood of Man,'' the climactic
number from ``How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the episode is just teeing up the big song-and-dance
finale. Hal Linden, no stranger to the Broadway boards, guest stars
as head of the Dutch conglomerate that owns Winfred-Louder
department store. He comes to town to fire everyone and dynamite
the store, which is, of course, the perfect set-up for the song,
about an employee trying to convince a boss that there are other
values besides the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Morse did it first (on stage and in the movie version),
and Matthew Broderick did it quite well a few years ago in a
revival, and neither has anything to worry about from Carey. His
voice is thin, his dancing lively but limited, by Broadway
standards.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the point. The sheer guts of tackling a four and
one-half minute slab of singing and elaborate choreography is more
than most sitcoms would dare. And Carey &AMP; Co. pull it off with an
infectious exuberance as they swirl and kick from their office
cubicles out onto the store floor and then to the boardroom.
</P>
<P>
   It's a high, giddy sequence, and a perfect note on which to end
the May sweeps.
</P>
<P>
   Other finales tonight, the last night of sweeps:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Dawson's Creek'' (8 p.m. on the WB). Dad problems abound.
Dawson finds out Joey's father is dealing drugs again, and Pacey
dukes it out with his father.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Dharma &AMP; Greg'' (8 p.m. on ABC). Realizing they never really
dated, the cute couple proceed to turn back the clock and do so.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Law &AMP; Order'' (9 p.m. on NBC). Benjamin Bratt becomes the
latest member to exit the revolving door cast in tonight's two-hour
special.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Drew Carey Show.''
</P>
<P>
   9 tonight on ABC

O'CONNOR SHOWS THE LENS OF GENDER CHANGES THE VIEW OF COURT CASES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ During her 18 years on the Supreme Court, Sandra
Day O'Connor has often been the justice in the middle of a sharply
divided court. In Monday's 5-to-4 decision on sexual harassment in
the schools, she was, perhaps more clearly than ever, the woman in
the middle as well.
</P>
<P>
   There was a memorable scene, lasting no more than 10 minutes, as
O'Connor and Justice Anthony M. Kennedy each summarized their
respective majority and dissenting opinions for a courtroom
audience of lawyers and tourists. The two justices, both Westerners
in their 60s, both Stanford University graduates, both the
appointees of Republican presidents, each the parent of three grown
children, might have been speaking from different planets.
</P>
<P>
   For O'Connor, explaining the majority's view that public school
districts can be held accountable for one student's flagrant sexual
harassment of another, the case was about sex discrimination so
severe as to destroy the learning environment in the classroom. For
Kennedy, speaking for the four dissenters, the case was about
federal intrusion into a place where the federal government has no
business.
</P>
<P>
   That O'Connor and Kennedy are longtime allies in the cause of
states' rights made this non-meeting of the minds all the more
striking. Ever since O'Connor arrived on the court in 1981 as the
FWOTSC, as the First Woman on the Supreme Court has drily referred
to herself, the obvious question has been: does it make a
difference? Monday's decision, indeed O'Connor's entire Supreme
Court career when viewed through the lens of gender, suggests that
it does.
</P>
<P>
   That is not a notion completely foreign to O'Connor herself, who
wrote, concurring in a 1994 decision that made it unconstitutional
to remove prospective jurors on the basis of sex, that although
there were no ``definitive studies'' on how jurors behaved in cases
of sexual harassment, child custody, or domestic abuse, ``one need
not be a sexist to share the intuition that in certain cases a
person's gender and resulting life experience will be relevant to
his or her view of the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it completely foreign to her junior Supreme Court
colleague, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who joined her opinion this week in
Davis vs. Monroe County Board of Education. Ginsburg recounted in a
1997 speech to the Women's Bar Association here how a year earlier,
as she announced her opinion declaring unconstitutional the
all-male admissions policy at the Virginia Military Institute, she
looked across the bench at O'Connor and thought of the legacy they
were building together.
</P>
<P>
   Ginsburg's opinion in the Virginia case cited one of O'Connor's
earliest majority opinions for the court, a 1982 decision called
Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan that declared
unconstitutional the exclusion of male students from a
state-supported nursing school. O'Connor, warning against using
``archaic and stereotypic notions'' about the roles of men and
women, herself cited in that opinion some of the Supreme Court
cases that Ruth Ginsburg, who was not to join the court for another
11 years, had argued and won as a noted women's rights advocate
during the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the women's bar group, Ginsburg noted that the vote
in O'Connor's 1982 opinion was 5 to 4, while the vote to strike
down men-only admissions in Virginia 14 years later was 7 to 1.
``What occurred in the intervening years in the court, as elsewhere
in society?'' Justice Ginsburg asked. The answer, she continued,
lay in a line from Shakespeare that O'Connor had recently spoken in
the character of Isabel, Queen of France, in a local production of
Henry V: ``Happily a woman's voice may do some good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like the argument that we have to have women or else
nobody will listen, but it does seem to be making a difference,''
Suzanna Sherry, a law professor at the University of Minnesota,
said in an interview Tuesday. She said that while it was always
clear that O'Connor had first-hand experience with the classic
model of sex discrimination, ``the question has been whether she
would recognize the changing face of discrimination, and it looks
like she can.''
</P>
<P>
   Another scholar of the Court, Nancy Maveety, a political
scientist at Tulane University who wrote a book about O'Connor,
``Strategist of the Supreme Court,'' (Rowman Littlefield, 1996)
also said she found O'Connor's vote this week notable. ``I would
have expected a fence-straddling concurrence,'' Maveety said. She
said the outcome was an important indication of the relative weight
O'Connor gave to the discrimination arguments as opposed to the
federalism concerns of the dissenters. ``For something to trump
federalism for her, that's a big deal,'' Maveety said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A top graduate of Stanford Law School in 1952 (her classmate,
William H. Rehnquist, went on to a Supreme Court clerkship, an
opportunity that was not then open to women), Sandra O'Connor
applied to law firms only to receive job offers as a secretary. The
experience led her into the public sector and eventually to
elective politics. She served as majority leader of the Arizona
State Senate in the early 1970s, the first woman in the country to
hold so high a state legislative office, and from there became a
state court judge.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a top graduate of Harvard and Columbia Law
Schools, also found doors closed to her, although her career led
her to law school teaching and advocacy, for some years under the
aegis of the American Civil Liberties Union. Their politics and
their views on many issues, perhaps most notably on the appropriate
role of race in political districting and government contracting,
are significantly different. But there is clearly a bond between
the two justices. They laugh about the fact that some of the most
experienced lawyers in the country mix up their names when
addressing them during argument sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Some court observers think the presence of two women on the
court is substantially greater than the sum of one plus one.
``Having two makes a huge difference,'' said Peter J. Rubin, a law
professor at Georgetown University who clerked on the court in the
early 1990s, just before Ginsburg's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just makes it a lot easier,'' Rubin said. ``It's only human
nature. You're in an insulated environment. You're not out there on
the ground. When two colleagues who have had different experiences
say that here is a problem to be taken very seriously, it's bound
to have an impact.''

KOSOVAR REFUGEE WONDERS WHAT HE WOULD GO BACK TO 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GURPINAR, Turkey _ Twenty years ago, Ismail Bolukbasi opened a
restaurant in Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, and it quickly
attracted a clientele as diverse as Kosovo itself was.
</P>
<P>
   Albanian intellectuals dined alongside Serbian police officers.
People whose forefathers were Turkish, as Bolukbasi's were, mixed
freely with Macedonians, Jews, Croats, Greeks, Slovenes and whoever
else found their way through his portals. Cognac was the social
lubricant of choice.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Bolukbasi is that faceless being called a refugee _ part
of the human flood that has surged out of Kosovo in recent weeks.
He has lost his home, his restaurant, many of his friends and
everything he worked to build.
</P>
<P>
   Now he finds himself responsible for an extended family of 23
people, ranging from small children to his 67-year-old mother. They
are jammed into a small apartment in a dreary cement colony outside
Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his misfortunes, Bolukbasi knows that he is among the
lucky ones. He and most of his relatives have escaped the Balkan
inferno. Thanks to help from a Turkish friend, they have a place to
live and food to eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life was beautiful in Kosovo until 1989,'' Bolukbasi
rhapsodized. ``I wouldn't trade a minute of that time with anyone
in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1989 that Slobodan Milosevic, now the Yugoslav
president, began his climb to power with fiery promises to his
Serbian brethren in Kosovo. Soon afterward, Albanian-language
schools in Kosovo were closed, thousands of Kosovo Albanians were
dismissed from their jobs to be replaced with Serbs, and a spiral
of ethnic chauvinism was set in motion that led to the savagery of
the last two months.
</P>
<P>
   Bolukbasi, whose wife is of Albanian extraction, fled his home
at the end of March, not long after NATO began its bombing
campaign. He spent his last evening in Pristina with a band of
Serbian militiamen, who urged him to bomb the apartment of his
upstairs neighbor, an Albanian nationalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them I couldn't do that, because if I bombed the
building my family would also die,'' he said. ``One of the thugs
reached into his shirt and pulled out a knife. He told me, `OK, if
you can't bomb the guy, just go up and cut his throat.'''
</P>
<P>
   An hour after escaping from that encounter, Bolukbasi and eight
relatives packed themselves into a car and set out on a trek that
took them first to Macedonia and ultimately to Turkey. He has vague
dreams of joining relatives in Germany, but he seems to lose
concentration when he considers the future. The past also brings
tears to his eyes, so he lives only in the present.
</P>
<P>
   As the oldest of five siblings, Bolukbasi, 45, must now assume
the role of patriarch. One member of his clan is a 20-year-old
woman whose mother, Bolukbasi's sister, was turned back as she
tried to flee Kosovo. The younger woman rarely speaks, and no one
in the crowded apartment has any idea of what has befallen her
immediate family.
</P>
<P>
   Tuade Bolukbasi, 35, landed in Turkey after a harrowing
month-long flight from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police came to our house with guns and told us we could
leave the building if we each paid 200 marks,'' Ms. Bolukbasi said,
naming a sum equivalent to about $130. ``Then they made the women
watch while they beat the men. They told us, `Look at how we can
beat Albanians. You wanted NATO, so now you have NATO. See if NATO
can help you.'''
</P>
<P>
   So far, only one member of the Bolukbasi clan has found work in
Turkey. He is a 16-year-old youth who packs groceries at a market.
The family is being sustained by his salary, help from their
Turkish patron and donations from municipal officials.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey has deep historical ties to the Kosovo Albanians. In
fact, some Serbs have asserted that Ottoman Turks created the
region's ethnic problem centuries ago by capturing the region and
persuading some of its citizens to convert from Orthodox
Christianity to Islam.
</P>
<P>
   This history has given Turks a feeling of kinship with the
people fleeing Kosovo. Turkey has accepted thousands of them since
the crisis began in March. More than 5,000 are living at a camp at
Kirklareli in western Turkey, and the rest, like the Bolukbasi
family, have melted into the population.
</P>
<P>
   President Suleyman Demirel of Turkey visited the Kirklareli camp
recently, distributed radios and other gifts, and told refugees,
``You will be back home in your land before winter comes.''
</P>
<P>
   That pledge sounds far-fetched to refugees like Bolukbasi.
``Even if I could go back, what would I go back to?'' he wondered.
``What would I do? How would I live with neighbors who killed
children?''
</P>
<P>
   After a lifetime of friendship with people whose ethnic identity
never seemed important, Bolukbasi now finds himself among those who
want to take revenge on those they perceive as their persecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like what NATO has done so far,'' he said solemnly. ``But
now I want them to start killing people. All Serbs are Milosevic
now. All of them are maniacs. Everything I knew can never be
again.''

SERBIAN STUDENTS DISMISS NATO TV AS UNWELCOME PROPAGANDA 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ The picture is grainy, the sound poor,
but if people here really want to, and if they have electricity,
they can tune into NATO TV, beamed into Serbia on Channel 21 every
evening from an American Hercules plane.
</P>
<P>
   A colored map of Yugoslavia appears on the screen, and alongside
it, the NATO logo. ``The Voice of NATO,'' it reads. Cheerful pop
music plays in the background.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can they play cheerful music when they are bombing us,''
one of a group of Serbian college students watching said angrily
the other day. The students had gathered to watch the video, taped
by a friend, since few of them have managed to tune into NATO TV
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's broadcasts, apparently aimed at countering the Serbian
government's monopoly on television news and information, are
falling pretty flat. They are difficult to find in the first place
and seem to arouse more irritation than positive response. Serbian
citizens, already fed up with NATO bombs, are in no mood to listen
to NATO's point of view.
</P>
<P>
   The students were willing enough to come to see the broadcast.
But within seconds, they tore into the program with hostile, and
sometimes humorous, criticism for its style and content. ``I am
being bombed so I do not appreciate their lies,'' said Jelena, a
biology student.
</P>
<P>
   The others began discussing the accent of the announcer, picking
up his pronunciation mistakes and trying to figure out where he was
from. Was he a Croat, they wondered, or was an emigre Serb brought
up in the West? They mimicked the next speaker, who had a strong
foreign accent _ probably American, they said, or was he French?
</P>
<P>
   They barely listened to the first item, a message to the people
of Yugoslavia from the NATO secretary-general, Javier Solana,
saying the intervention was not aimed against the people of Serbia
but against President Slobodan Milosevic. They had heard it all
before, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is your station for news and information,'' the announcer
said. He began reading reports from the world's press about the
Chinese Embassy bombing. ``Only certain papers do not believe it
was a mistake, namely Serbian, Chinese and Korean papers,'' he went
on.
</P>
<P>
   The students groaned as he read comments from European papers.
``This is the same as our television,'' Jelena said. ``They are
quoting foreign newspapers, but they are choosing what they like to
choose.''
</P>
<P>
   People in Serbia are used to hearing government propaganda, and
so they are particularly sensitive about having opinions thrust
upon them, said Marija, an architectural student. ``When you are
used to not believing, you know what is the truth and what they are
trying to push on you,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The announcer moved on to read Western news agency reports of
the news of the day, saying the program would now show pictures
from Kosovo and the refugee camps in Albania and Macedonia. The
pictures never appeared, though, and the same pink, yellow and blue
map of Yugoslavia sat on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is boring and badly done _ it is miserable,'' Marija
said.
</P>
<P>
   Djordje, a mechanical engineering student at Belgrade
University, said: ``I cannot understand how such an organization
with so many analysts and brains can transmit something like this
to Serbs. They should at least broadcast our folk music. It is
completely unconvincing.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO TV probably could not hope for an impartial viewing from
Serbs while its parent organization continues to bomb their
country. The fliers NATO has dropped from planes over the city in
recent weeks have not been much of a hit either. They are well
designed and understated, but the students were quick to find
fault. NATO has again failed to understand the Serbian mentality,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   One flier says Milosevic has betrayed his people in embarking on
wars in Croatia and Bosnia that led to the loss of Serbian lands.
Serbs see it differently, they said. Most Serbs see his betrayal in
the signing of the Dayton peace accords, which ended the fighting
there.
</P>
<P>
   For all their sophistication, and their access to the Internet
and satellite television, the Belgrade students apparently are
susceptible to government propaganda and often repeat its
arguments. They know it themselves, but when faced with NATO
propaganda, they say they prefer their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hate Milosevic, but at least he's ours,'' Jelena said.

REPORT DETAILS PESTICIDE DAMAGE IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE KAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ More than 25 years after regulators banned DDT
for harming wildlife, pesticides continue to kill birds and fish,
interfere with their reproduction and threaten the very survival of
many species, according to a study released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The study by advocates of pesticide controls calls for an
immediate ban on two commonly used agricultural and garden
pesticides, diazinon and chlorpyrifos, plus carbofuran, which is
used by California rice growers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A massive chemical assault on our environment is launched each
year by California's residents, farmers and official agencies, as
we apply hundreds of millions of pounds of pesticide active
ingredients in our homes and gardens, on crops, on roadsides and in
forests,'' said Susan Kegley, one of the authors and a chemist at
the San Francisco-based Pesticide Action Network.
</P>
<P>
   Neither California growers nor state pesticide regulators had
seen the report, and therefore could not comment on its assessment
of pesticide damage to wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Of the call for a ban, California Farm Bureau Federation
spokesman Dave Kranz said, ``California farmers face the most
stringent regulations of any farmers on the planet as far as their
use of pesticides. Farmers want to do the right thing, and they are
trying to make a living and trying to maintain the environment and
live within the rules and regulations. A blanket ban would cause
difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   In California each year, more than 100 million pounds of the
most toxic pesticides in city and farm settings are ``responsible
for the deaths of many birds, fish and smaller aquatic animals that
fish depend on for food,'' Kegley said.
</P>
<P>
   The study, ``Disrupting the Balance: Ecological Impacts of
Pesticides in California,'' says birds are hit hardest.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, 672 million birds are exposed to
agricultural pesticides each year, and an estimated 10 percent, or
67 million, die, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   But, it asserted, most bird deaths caused by pesticides go
undocumented, and only a small fraction are reported. Sometimes the
chemicals kill wildlife outright, leaving dramatic evidence. Other
times, the chemicals subtly damage birds' behavior and their
reproductive and nervous systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The loss of even a few individuals from rare, endangered or
threatened species _ for example, burrowing owls, Aleutian Canada
geese or raptors like the bald eagle, Swainson's hawk and the
peregrine falcon _ pushes the entire species that much closer to
extinction,'' Kegley said.
</P>
<P>
   One environmentalist praised the study, saying it provides
important documentation in bringing the pesticide issue to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that pesticides are both directly killing birds at
times and can completely disrupt the food chain,'' said Craig
Breon, an environmental advocate in the Santa Clara Valley Audubon
Society. He urged cooperation with farmers and state regulators
``to see that this issue is addressed appropriately.''
</P>
<P>
   The study drew its statistics and conclusions from peer-reviewed
papers published in science and wildlife journals, government
documents, compilations of pesticide studies and interviews with
regulating agencies in California and elsewhere.

 TWO CALIFORNIA CITIES SET TO SUE TOP GUNMAKERS  &HT;     By HARRIET CHIANG 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The cities of San Francisco and Los Angeles are
expected to sue the nation's leading gun manufacturers Tuesday in a
coordinated legal assault against the firearms industry.
</P>
<P>
   The cities hope the lawsuits will force the gun industry to take
steps to keep its weapons from criminals and to add safety devices
such as trigger locks.
</P>
<P>
   Similar suits have been filed by 10 cities, including Chicago,
Miami and New Orleans, as part of a growing movement to try to hold
the firearms industry responsible for gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   But those suits have sought to hold gun companies liable on the
grounds that they are negligently selling a dangerous product. The
suits being filed by San Francisco and Los Angeles are unusual
because they rely on a sweeping consumer protection law in which
companies can be held liable for illegal, unfair or deceptive
business practices.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco will be joined in its Superior Court suit by
Sacramento, Berkeley and San Mateo. Los Angeles will file its suit
along with Compton. Lawyers in charge of the two suits say they
expect several more cities to join the litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Both suits will be filed against at least 40 gun manufacturers,
distributors and trade associations. The gunmakers include Smith &AMP;
Wesson, Colt, Beretta and Sturm, Ruger and Co.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits take special aim at the handful of manufacturers in
the Los Angeles area that produce the cheap handguns known as
Saturday night specials. California, which has one of the largest
handgun industries in the country, is the leading manufacturer of
Saturday night specials.
</P>
<P>
   The city lawyers say gunmakers are washing their hands of any
responsibility for their product once it is distributed. Their
attitude is, ``Once it's out our loading dock, it's not our problem
anymore,'' said Owen Clements, chief of special litigation for the
San Francisco city attorney's office, who is coordinating the gun
suit. ``We don't think that's a responsible practice.''
</P>
<P>
   The suits are not seeking specific damages, although civil
penalties and other sanctions could amount to millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it will be very significant in forcing gun
manufacturers to start acting more responsibly,'' said Luis Tolley,
a spokesman for Handgun Control, the legal action arm of the Center
to Prevent Handgun Violence, which is co-counsel in the litigation.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the gun industry has won almost every court battle.
However, in February, a New York jury found several of the nation's
largest gunmakers negligent for their marketing and distribution
practices and awarded gun victims a small amount of damages.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Delfay, president of the Sporting Arms and Ammunition
Manufacturers Institute, the largest gun industry trade
association, told the New York Times that there is no proof that
the industry is supplying guns to the criminal market.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way for a manufacturer to know a specific firearm
is going to be used in crime,'' said Delfay, whose group is among
those named as defendants. ``If there was, I'm certain all
manufacturers would sacrifice that sale in a New York minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Clements said that accusing the gunmakers of violating
California consumer laws by failing to monitor the distribution of
their product has several advantages for the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a broad statute that reaches all sorts of conduct that
might not be technically illegal but is unfair,'' Clements said.
</P>
<P>
   The cities say guns often fall into criminal hands through
``straw purchases'' _ in which someone lawfully purchases a large
amount of weapons, then sells them to felons or people who are
underage.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (gun companies) are selling in a way that facilitates the
supply to the criminal market,'' said Carmel Sella, the special
assistant in the Los Angeles city attorney's office who is
coordinating the Southern California suit.
</P>
<P>
   Sella said in Los Angeles, 4,700 guns are confiscated in crimes
every year.
</P>
<P>
   To win their lawsuits, the California cities will not have to
prove that the gun manufacturers caused any specific injuries, an
obstacle that many gun victims have not been able to overcome.
Instead, the cities will have to prove only that the gunmakers
engaged in an unfair business practice in distributing their
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of damages, the cities would be eligible to collect
$2,500 in civil penalties for each violation. A judge would decide
what constitutes a violation subject to the $2,500 penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more significantly, the law could force the gunmakers to
give up the profits from their allegedly unfair activities.
</P>
<P>
   The suits use the same consumer law that San Francisco used to
challenge the tobacco industry in 1996. That suit was the first
complaint filed by a city against cigarette manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, the city took part in the $206 billion
settlement reached between the states and the nation's leading
tobacco sellers. California will receive $26 billion from the pact,
with the state's counties and four largest cities, including San
Francisco, receiving $12.5 billion over the next 25 years. &QL;

 &HT;    POLLUTION IN MINORITY COMMUNITIES TARGETED
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (a) general news categories

   WASHINGTON -- Birds don't nest anymore in the trees of Eraina
Dunn's hometown of Robbins, Ill. She blames it on fumes from the
city incinerator.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are lucky enough to see one, they are usually just
flying through, not to stay and roost,'' Dunn said Tuesday at a
symposium on pollution in minority communities.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors of the symposium say minority communities are
disproportionately exposed to toxic waste.
</P>
<P>
   The symposium was sponsored by 14 members of the congressional
black, Hispanic and progressive caucuses, and included residents of
contaminated areas, activists and scholars.
</P>
<P>
   Participants recommended that awareness of pollution in minority
communities be increased through legislation and education. They
also discussed the need to frame the issue in terms of health, not
civil rights, and the possibility of having the General Accounting
Office do a cost-benefit analysis of industries operating in
low-income communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Environmental justice'' is likely to be the ``issue of the
next century,'' said Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich. He cited President
Clinton's executive order that federal agencies decrease the number
of toxic sites in minority and low-income communities.
</P>
<P>
   While federal agencies have proposed ways to achieve this goal,
some activists say state governments, particularly in the South,
are not cooperating. States are not obligated to adhere to those
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Sherrill Marcus, a community organizer with the Southern
Organization Committee for Economic and Social Justice in Atlanta,
said residents should have input in any action involving potential
pollution sites in their community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Help people make decisions rather than react to decisions that
have already been made,'' Marcus said.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue raised during the symposium was whether tackling
pollution in minority communities hampers economic development.
Participants rejected the idea of going easy on pollution for the
promise of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not willing to trade our health for jobs,'' said
Florence Robinson, representing the North Baton Rouge Environmental
Association in Louisiana. Communities rarely profit from
enterprises such as medical waste disposal, she said, because they
offer jobs that are ``usually subservient positions with
substandard wages.''

 &HT;    GLENN'S SPACE FLIGHT RAISES HOPES FOR TREATMENT OF BALANCE ILLS
 &HT;    By SCOTT MONTGOMERY
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ John Glenn surprised NASA researchers by promptly
regaining normal balance soon after his space shuttle mission last
October, and his quick recovery suggests older people might respond
to treatment for balance disorders, a leading scientist said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Although the 77-year-old former Ohio senator's first wobbly
steps off the shuttle Discovery were broadcast across the globe,
Glenn felt fine just four days later, which is within the average
range for astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   And test results on Glenn's inner ear, discussed for the first
time at Tuesday's symposium on geriatric research in Washington,
confirmed that the oldest man ever in space readapted to Earth's
gravity ``at least as fast'' as younger astronauts, said chief
researcher Dr. Owen Black, who heads the Neurotology(cq) Research
Laboratory in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Black, who had expected Glenn to need much longer to recover his
sense of balance than the rest of the shuttle crew, was cautiously
enthusiastic about the implications of his study.
</P>
<P>
   ``In science, you have to be very careful of what you say about
one (test) subject,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked if the results were significant, Black said,
``absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   In his research into the human balance system in the inner ear,
which is funded by NASA and the National Institutes of Health,
Black and others have developed ways to evaluate damage to the
vestibular system as well as some methods for repairing the damage.
</P>
<P>
   This work is particularly important to the elderly, who often
suffer balance problems that can lead to dangerous falls. Now Black
says there's the ``potential'' that the Glenn results could mean
elderly people with balance disorders can correct their vestibular
systems through treatment.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, Glenn proves that an elderly man's vestibular
system is capable of the kind of readaptation that's critical to
the treatment in Black's program.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least there's the potential to put (elderly people) through
our training program,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn flew aboard the space shuttle Discovery as a subject of
several biology experiments seeking to understand the parallels
between the effects of aging on the body, and similar effects
caused by prolonged weightlessness in space.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to monitoring Glenn's balance before and after his
space flight, crew members during the mission collected data to
study the rate at which his body absorbed protein while in zero
gravity, as well as his ability to get restful sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Both muscle atrophy and sleep disruption are features of the
aging process and prolonged space flight. Scientists hope that
studying these effects in health astronauts will lead to
discovering the mechanisms that trigger such problems, which could
then lead to methods of controlling them.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Liskowsky, who heads the NASA life sciences division,
said he expects results from the remaining Glenn experiments to be
revealed when NASA holds its customary flight anniversary
symposium. Although Liskowsky said nothing has been scheduled, the
anniversary is Oct. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn also attended the symposium Tuesday and added to the
discussion of balance disorders by admitting that his first moments
back on Earth after nine days in space were uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I barfed,'' he said.

 &HT;    Statistics can skewer realities of firearms
 &HT;    By Alan Judd
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's a shocking statistic: Six thousand students were
caught bringing guns to U.S. schools during the past two years, but
a mere 13 cases were prosecuted under a federal law the Clinton
administration promoted to keep guns away from schools.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the call for additional gun control after a wave
of school shootings, the purported gap between arrests and
prosecutions has been cited and recited by political figures and
others who say existing laws should be better enforced before new
gun restrictions are imposed. It will be a central theme of a House
hearing Thursday into new gun-control proposals.
</P>
<P>
   There's just one problem: While plenty shocking, this statistic
isn't entirely accurate.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that about 6,000 students were cited in 1997 and 1998
under the federal Gun-Free Schools Act for bringing firearms to
school. But, as the law requires, those students were suspended
from school and charged as juvenile delinquents in state and local
courts.
</P>
<P>
   And it is true that the U.S. Justice Department prosecuted just
13 people the past two years under the federal Gun-Free School Zone
Act, a separate law that prohibits the possession of firearms
within 1,000 feet of a school. But thousands of other defendants
who allegedly violated the federal law, including the 15-year-old
accused of shooting six classmates at Heritage High School in
Rockdale County, Ga., have been charged or prosecuted under state
laws.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutions, authorities say, are reserved for
particularly flagrant cases.
</P>
<P>
   The 13 prosecutions have nothing to do with the 6,000 instances
of children bringing guns to school, said U.S. Justice Department
and White House officials, who complained that gun-control
opponents have drawn a misleading, if salient, link between the two
numbers to divert attention from the emotional issues of school
violence and firearms restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at any number in a vacuum, you can find a problem
with it,'' said Brian Steel, a spokesman for the Justice
Department. ``This is a total smokescreen.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the latest year for which statistics are available, the
federal government prosecuted 6,078 gun offenses, the Justice
Department said. State and local prosecutors handled the rest of
the year's 218,900 arrests in which a weapons offense was the most
serious charge.
</P>
<P>
   With political opponents citing such figures, the Clinton
administration's enforcement of existing gun laws is becoming a
focal point in the debate over new regulations.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the Georgia Republican Party last Saturday, Wayne
LaPierre, the National Rifle Association's executive vice
president, deplored ``a collapse of federal firearms law
enforcement.'' At the same meeting, in Augusta, GOP presidential
contender Steve Forbes ridiculed the administration's record on
firearms violations at schools. ``In 1997,'' he said, ``they
prosecuted a total of five. Last year, they prosecuted eight. And
you can hear the White House spin now: From five to eight, that's a
60 percent increase.''
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee is ready to consider a bill
supported by the president, similar to one the Senate passed last
week, that would mandate background checks on people who buy
weapons at gun shows and would require trigger locks on all
firearms. But at a hearing on Thursday, the House panel first will
ask why Clinton's Justice Department isn't prosecuting more cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've taken it upon ourselves to federalize a lot of crimes,
and it's the Department of Justice's responsibility to see to it
that those laws are executed and followed,'' said Michael Connolly,
a spokesman for Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde (R-Ill.). ``What's
the point of passing new laws? . . . We want to look at how and why
these (new proposals) would be prosecuted differently than the
current record the administration has put together.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.), a Judiciary member, described the
low prosecution figures as ``a major problem for the
administration.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All this president is interested in is a sound bite, a photo
op with a bunch of cardboard cops behind him to show that he's
tough on crime,'' Barr said. ``They are more interested in limiting
access to firearms by citizens than they are in tackling the misuse
of firearms by criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   But a White House spokeswoman said focusing on how many cases
are prosecuted is irrelevant. More important, said Julie Goldberg,
a deputy press secretary, is the fact that the number of reported
violent crimes involving firearms decreased by 29 percent from 1993
to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enforcement alone is not enough,'' Goldberg said. ``There are
other issues that Congress also needs to look at. That's what the
president is hoping to have Congress act on _ his proposals to
prevent crimes and prevent guns from getting into the hands of
children.''

 &HT;    South Africa prepares to take another step on the long walk to
freedom
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ In the crowds that swell through
the modern walkways of the East Gate mall on the outskirts of
Johannesburg, between the jewelry shops and the clothing stores,
between the music shops, the toy stores and the Chick-Fil-A, black
people and white people mingle freely.
</P>
<P>
   They browse the same windows, work behind the same counters, eat
at the same restaurants and share the same taxis.
</P>
<P>
   Five years after South Africa's first all-race elections
propelled the country's first black-led government to power _ and
ended the official policy of racial oppression known as apartheid _
relations between whites and blacks are more relaxed and less
fractious than almost anyone could have predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've forgiven them,'' said Bennie Makololo, 34, a black man
who sells security fences in Alexandra, an area of Johannesburg.
``Black people are not angry at whites.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that it was a miracle,'' said Danie van den Heever,
47, a white businessman who is an eighth-generation South African.
``There's a reconciliation of South Africans who are able to
communicate, to share their desires, to share their concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all is rosy between the races, of course: Some white racism
lingers, and so does some black anger. But the predicted bloodbath
never came; whites with money and property were not overrun by
black mobs, as they had feared; and radicalism among both blacks
and whites has declined.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, as big a relief as that transformation has been, the
country still faces enormous challenges. Violent crime is as
pervasive as anywhere in the world. Most blacks are still very
poor, and economic power remains concentrated in the hands of the
white minority. Unemployment, which primarily affects blacks, is
estimated at 38 percent. And while schools in some white areas
would be the envy of Cobb County, the educational system in many
black areas _ which is to say, most of the country _ is in
desperate straits. Schools lack electricity, books, qualified
teachers and adequate facilities.
</P>
<P>
   On June 2, one week from today, voters will go to the polls to
choose a successor to President Nelson Mandela, the man who emerged
from 27 years in prison to become chief architect of the country's
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   Most will do so in the full knowledge that South Africa, a
country basking in the glow of one miracle, desperately needs yet
another. The transformation the country must make now is not
emotional but economic.
</P>
<P>
   Most political observers feel certain that the election will be
won by the African National Congress. It is, after all, the party
of Mandela _ a man who, to many black South Africans, is nothing
less than George Washington and Martin Luther King Jr. rolled into
one.
</P>
<P>
   If so, the new president will be Thabo Mbeki, a 57-year-old
British-educated economist. He is the son of Govan Mbeki, a
journalist and activist who served time in prison with Mandela.
Thabo Mbeki has been deputy president since 1996, and over the past
couple of years, as Mandela has concentrated on the overarching
message of reconciliation, Mbeki has run the country's day-to-day
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela turned out to be perfectly suited to working the miracle
of reconciliation. A former prisoner, he forgave his captors. As
president, he shared lunch with the prosecutor who succeeded in
getting him sentenced to life in prison. He paid a courtesy call to
Betsie Verwoerd, the widow of Hendrik Verwoerd, the main designer
of apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some South Africans think _ or hope, at any rate _ that
Mbeki will be better suited than Mandela to the difficult and
technical tasks of reviving the economy, reducing unemployment,
curtailing crime and reforming education. While he lacks Mandela's
instinct for the grand gesture, he earned a master's in economics
from Sussex University in England, and he is a suave and
sophisticated politician who has promoted the idea of a
continentwide ``African renaissance'' based on economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   The only question most South African election-watchers have is
whether the ANC will win the two-thirds majority in Parliament that
would allow it to amend the constitution without relying on the
votes of opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents, aware that their chances of victory are slender at
best, have urged voters to hold the ANC parliamentary membership
below two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a party that has too much power inevitably abuses
it,'' said veteran anti-apartheid activist Helen Suzman, a member
of the Democratic Party _ and a friend of Mandela's.
</P>
<P>
   The ANC received 62.6 percent of the vote when it won power in
the election of 1994 and formed a government of national unity with
the National Party, which was the party of apartheid, and the
Zulu-oriented Inkatha Freedom Party. The National Party withdrew
from the coalition in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   If the ANC wins again, the reason will be more than just
residual goodwill toward Mandela and gratitude toward the party
that negotiated the end of apartheid. Beyond the freedom to live,
travel, shop and use the same rest rooms as whites, some blacks in
South Africa have seen small _ but noticeable _ improvements in
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Muriel Maseko, for example, lives in a squatter camp in Soweto,
the black township southwest of Johannesburg. Pitted roads splay
out between rows of makeshift shacks built of scraps of corrugated
iron. There is no plumbing; residents must use portable toilets the
government has placed along the roadsides every four or five
houses.
</P>
<P>
   Yet to Maseko this bit of squalor might as well be heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Before she moved here a couple of years ago and built a house
herself, Maseko, 66, was homeless. She lived in a shelter, crammed
into a single room with dozens of other people.
</P>
<P>
   Now she has four rooms, and she shares them with only two other
people _ her daughter and randdaughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing quite a lot better,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Had she built before the end of apartheid, she said, her house _
and, indeed, the entire squatter camp _ could well have fallen
before government bulldozers.
</P>
<P>
   Another person who is doing better is Emma Mhlongo, a
37-year-old mother of four who lives in Ebony Park, a neighborhood
of small, cinderblock houses east of Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
   Mhlongo lives in one of the homes _ new houses the government
has built in an effort to improve the lives of the millions of
black South Africans who are landless.
</P>
<P>
   The house is far too small for a family of six. But it's solid,
and it has running water. It's an improvement over Mhlongo's
previous circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to be in the squatter camp down the road,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For those who used to be homeless, the right to live unmolested
in a squatter camp is a step up. For those who were already in
squatter camps, the right to own government-built houses, however
small and boxy, is a step up from that.
</P>
<P>
   According to the ANC, the government has, in the last five
years, brought running water to 3 million people, housed nearly 3
million people, connected 2 million households to electricity, and
transferred ownership of some land to 68,000 households.
</P>
<P>
   That may not seem like much in a country of 43.4 million people
where the majority remain impoverished. But it is something.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are steadily but surely starting to dent the massive
inequalities and poverty created by apartheid,'' says the ANC's
election manifesto. ``It is only by overcoming the huge
inequalities in our society that we shall be able to build a truly
non-racial democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent conversations, many black South Africans expressed
strong support for the ANC, even though the tasks ahead loom large.
Five years, they said, is a brief time in the life of the country,
and the government has been operating under constraints.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our government is doing a lot for us, '' Maseko said. ``Our
government has actually done its utmost best to improve our lives.
We have plenty of privileges, but the government does not have
enough funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she gets 500 rands a month _ about $83 _ as an old-age
pension, where before she got nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we don't starve any more,'' she said. ``And I'm free! I've
got a home in a squatter camp!''
</P>
<P>
   John Masinga, 46, a black man who runs a roadside exhaust-system
repair stand _ nothing more, really, than himself and a beat up
wooden table sitting among the exhaust fumes along the side of a
road north of Pretoria _ said people have to be patient with the
ANC.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some changes,'' he said. ``If it were not for the
ANC, I wouldn't be able to do this work. The government would send
some police to push me away. The ANC has done a lot, but we cannot
expect all the changes overnight. A small child cannot just be born
and on the same day walk.''
</P>
<P>
   But support for the ANC among blacks is not universal.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, there has not been any change,'' said Jacob Letshwene,
pastor of the St. Phillip Apostolic Church in the town of Mabopane,
outside Pretoria. ``People are jobless, and the crime rate is very
high. I am totally disappointed. Unfortunately, I voted for the ANC
in 1994.''
</P>
<P>
   Letshwene, in his late 50s, strolled the dirt streets of his
town in vest, tie and snap-brim straw hat. He said he will vote
this time for the United Christian Democratic Party. That is the
party of Lucas Mangope, the former president of Bophuthatswana,
which was this area's version of the theoretically independent
homelands, or Bantustans, into which the apartheid government tried
to herd the country's blacks.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Bantustans were not independent but had
considerable support from the apartheid government. All were
reabsorbed into South Africa upon apartheid's demise.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other parties likely to receive noticeable support are
the Inkatha Freedom Party, built around the Zulu politician
Mangosuthu Buthelezi; the New National Party, the reincarnation of
the party that once created apartheid; the Pan Africanist Congress,
a black party more radical than the ANC; the Democratic Party, a
party of white liberals that is the successor to the Progressive
Party founded by Helen Suzman, the veteran anti-apartheid
politician; and the United Democratic Movement, led, oddly enough,
by a black former member of the anti-apartheid ANC and a white
former member of the pro-apartheid National Party.
</P>
<P>
   The membership of some of those parties shows that, despite the
ethnic reconciliation that South Africa has achieved in the last
five years, this is still a society divided by tribe and race. The
Inkatha Freedom Party is largely Zulu. The United Christian
Democratic Party, with geographically limited appeal, is mostly
Tswana. The Democratic Party and the New National Party are almost
exclusively white.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who doubts the fractured nature of South Africa should
consider this: This is a country with 11 official languages.
</P>
<P>
   And the divisions between the four racial groups imposed on the
country by the system of apartheid _ whites, Indians, coloreds and
blacks _ still persist. Those divisions, some say, will persist far
into the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take a thousand years before we come together,'' said
Patrick Singh, 50, an Afro-Asian who classifies himself colored and
lives in a predominantly colored neighborhood of Johannesburg.
``The hate is still there.''
</P>
<P>
   The country may be quiet, but this is the calm before the storm,
Singh said. Sooner or later, he said, violence will sweep over
South Africa in response to white insistence on holding onto
economic power.
</P>
<P>
   The disparities in wealth between whites and blacks are very
stark.
</P>
<P>
   While many blacks live in squatter camps, or in extremely small
and modest houses, many white people in the northern suburbs of
Johannesburg, for example, drive Mercedes, work in fashionable
offices complexes, and live in posh homes in upscale First-World
neighborhoods. The northern suburbs of Johannesburg have been
reported to have the world's greatest concentration of swimming
pools outside of Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   And while some whites seem free of racism _ Marian Karsden, a
22-year-old mall store manager said she will vote for the
Zulu-oriented Inkatha Freedom Party _ among others, racism and
condescension still linger.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing wrong with having black people in government,
but I don't think they value life the same as white people,'' said
Cobie Schoeman, a 45-year-old clerk who lives in Pretoria with her
young daughter. ``I could be wrong, but I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, sentences recently imposed in two different
criminal cases convinced many black South Africans that the justice
system remains racist.
</P>
<P>
   On March 23, Nicholas Steyn, a white man who was convicted of
shooting a six-month-old baby girl to death as her cousin carried
her across Steyn's property, received a suspended sentence. The
next day, longtime anti-apartheid activist Allan Boesak, a black
man who was convicted of diverting charitable donations for poor
children to his personal use, was sentenced to six years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, relations between blacks and whites seem, overall,
to be on the mend. But relations between blacks, who make up 75
percent of the population, and coloreds, or mixed race people, who
make up 9 percent, tend to be hostile.
</P>
<P>
   Some blacks stereotype coloreds as foul-mouthed heavy drinkers
who think they're better than blacks because they're lighter. Some
coloreds stereotype blacks as racists every bit as virulent as the
whites who used to run this country.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a sizable number of coloreds _ many of whom speak
Afrikaans but few of whom speak speak Zulu _ plan to vote for the
New National Party next month. They say they were discriminated
against before by whites, they're being discriminated against now
by blacks, so they might as well vote for the party than can keep
order, manage the economy and quell crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were better off in South Africa when the National Party
was ruling, so I think I'll vote for the National Party,'' said
Denver Isaacs, a 24-year-old unemployed colored resident of
Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
   How in the world can a colored man vote for the party of
apartheid?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good question,'' Isaacs said. ``When the National Party
was in power, it was unfair. But now that the ANC is in, it is even
more unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   Sophia Wallenstein, 70, a retired factory worker who is colored,
said she has supported the National Party all her life _ and a
return to apartheid would be better than the current chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ``That time under the National Party was 100 percent better,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Such racial divisiveness might seem discouraging. Yet, amid all
the prejudice, poverty and crime, seeds of hope are beginning to
grow.
</P>
<P>
   In Mabopane, outside Pretoria, Nomzi Mashiane, a retired nurse,
used to drive every day by a large plot of unused city-owned land
that had become a dumping ground. Mashiane had worked in nutrition,
and one day it occurred to her: This land could be used to help
unemployed people earn money growing vegetables. And the vegetables
could improve people's diets.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, she got permission from the city to use the land
and began to organize people in the area to sell them on the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought that I was a bit looney,'' she said. ``They
thought that this would never work _ especially in an urban area.''
</P>
<P>
   But now the land is tilled by 53 people, most of them elderly.
Rows of spinach, cabbage, beets, onions, eggplant, beans, red
peppers and carrots sprout from the fertile earth.
</P>
<P>
   The people who work the plot keep some of the food for
themselves. The rest of the food is marketed in Pretoria, and those
who work the land share the profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, unemployed people do need some sense of pride,''
said Mashiane, who is 63. ``And better nutrition.''
</P>
<P>
   The project is a success largely because of Mashiane's energy
and initiative, and the diligent work of the jobless people
involved. But there was another crucial ingredient.
</P>
<P>
   Mashiane approached the department of agriculture of the
Northwest Province and convinced officials to give the project a
grant of 411,000 rands _ about $67,000 _ to install an irrigation
system. Taps protrude from the ground every 20 or 25 feet, ready to
water the vegetables and keep them healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Without this government grant, which could never have happened
under apartheid, Mashiane said, the project could never have
succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   The ANC-led government of South Africa still faces problems _
huge unemployment, rising crime, schools with no electricity or
textbooks _ that would daunt the most capable leaders in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But, to some people at least, the government appears to be
trying. And the small differences it has managed to make in the
lives of at least some of its people may well be enough to ensure
that it gets a second five years to try to address those problems.
</P>
<P>
   Esther Mashubuku, a 24-year-old who now owns one of the new
government-built houses in Ebony park, said she will vote for the
ANC. Definitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the house because of voting,'' she said. ``Next time
maybe I will get a car.''

49ERS COACH FACES TOUGH FIGHT WITH CANCER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN CRUMPACKER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ What began as a day of optimism for prospective
liver-recipient Bobb McKittrick ended with news that his cancer had
spread from the bile duct, forcing cancellation of an impending
transplant.
</P>
<P>
   McKittrick, the longtime offensive line coach for the San
Francisco 49ers, had gone into Stanford University Medical Center
Monday afternoon expecting to receive a partial liver after a
suitable donor organ had been located that morning in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Making the story more compelling was that McKittrick, 63, would
have shared the organ with a 6-year-old girl in a procedure known
as a split-liver transplant.
</P>
<P>
   The girl, who is too small to accept an adult liver, was
scheduled to receive a lobe of the organ before the remainder was
given to McKittrick.
</P>
<P>
   But when exploratory surgery was performed on McKittrick Monday
evening in preparation for the transplant, doctors discovered the
cancer, initially contained in the bile duct, had spread in the
form of white dots about the size of the head of a pin. The
transplant procedure, to be performed by liver specialists Carlos
Esquivel and Kenneth Drazlan, was canceled and McKittrick instead
had a biopsy to determine the extent of the cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did an exploratory (procedure) and found some pinpoint
spots. The cancer spread so they couldn't do the transplant,'' said
Teckla McKittrick, the wife of the popular assistant coach. ``They
operated on him for about three hours and did a biopsy. He'll
probably be in the hospital for three or four days and they'll
decide what to do. It's not good news.''
</P>
<P>
   McKittrick was diagnosed with cancer of the bile duct in
mid-January, when it was also determined he would need a new liver.
He started a routine of chemotherapy and radiation in February and
finished the regimen in mid-April. In the process, the 200-pound
McKittrick lost 33 pounds but had gained six back before returning
to the hospital Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel pretty good until I do something, then I don't have any
stamina,'' he said. ``I get tired easily.''
</P>
<P>
   But not too tired to do a little coaching. After receiving news
Monday morning about the donor organ, McKittrick did what he enjoys
most. He stopped by the 49ers' Santa Clara facility and instructed
center Jeremy Newberry and tackle Tyrone Hopson on the fine art of
pass blocking.
</P>
<P>
   Teckla McKittrick was not amused at her husband's devotion to
his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a little miffed I didn't come right home,'' he said
before going into the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   McKittrick had been on the national list for a liver transplant
since February. To be accepted into the transplant program, he had
to demonstrate otherwise good health and a positive attitude in
order to offset his age, which stretched the limits of most
transplant patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, my attitude was a positive factor in proceeding
with this program,'' he said. ``I'm a little older than they'd
like. Other than my illness, I'm pretty healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Because he has already had radiation in addition to
chemotherapy, McKittrick's treatment options are now limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Radiation is out,'' his son, Ladd McKittrick, 38, said. ``He's
already had his maximum. Some sort of chemotherapy will be
determined. That probably will be the most likely treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   McKittrick's future with the 49ers, which he joined in 1979, is
uncertain. His illness made the team shift tight ends coach Pat
Morris to the offensive line. In the last minicamp Morris was
assisted by former 49ers guard Guy McIntyre.
</P>
<P>
   McKittrick has said he'd like to coach until he's 65.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't play golf. I don't ski. I don't hunt. I don't fish. I
don't play tennis. I coach football, and I like it,'' he said.

 &HT;    CEO makes argument for broad use of broadband
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ BellSouth's chief executive this week urged the
government to encourage development of broadband networks that
would reach all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual pitch, delivered at the annual meeting of the
Southeastern Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, F.
Duane Ackerman called agencies like the Federal Communications
Commission to view high-speed Internet access as they would the
telephone _ a necessity.
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman told about 250 attendees in Savannah, Ga. that the rich
and the powerful are already well on their way to the new era.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business is already getting broadband,'' he said. ``In the
next year, great numbers of affluent neighborhoods will see
broadband _ with offerings from two competitors. Densely populated
areas will get broadband, (but) not so in rural areas. Nor is it
likely to happen in many poor neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman said high-speed access is a potential enhancement to
education and health care that will someday be considered routine _
at least for those who are well-off.
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman's comments came as BellSouth faces a likely challenge
from cable companies upgrading their networks to handle broadband _
a plan that will permit them to offer high-speed Internet,
television and phone service as well. Although the cable providers
have thus far upgraded only a portion of their systems, momentum
has been given a massive shove with AT&AMP;T's purchase of two huge
cable companies. The first, Tele-Communications Inc., has little
presence in Georgia. But MediaOne, whose acquisition has not become
final, is the largest cable provider in metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   To compete, BellSouth and other local phone companies plan to
offer digital subscriber lines (DSL), which can carry high-speed
data over already-installed copper lines. Aware that the DSL
rollout has been bumpy, BellSouth plans to add about 1,000 devices
around metro Atlanta that will double the distance the service can
operate.
</P>
<P>
   While a consumer might choose between two wires for broadband,
Ackerman said the law favors cable over phone.
</P>
<P>
   Cable companies, for example, are not required to make their
networks open to competitors or other services. Internet Service
Providers have argued in vain _ at least so far _ that cable should
be as open as the phone networks, which carry various competitors
to the local phone companies that own the lines.
</P>
<P>
   For years, cable companies have insisted that they needed a
regulatory shield to protect them from the multi-billion-dollar
phone companies. But more recently, as their upgrades continue and
consolidation makes them ever-huger, the cable companies have
become increasingly ready to have the regulatory protections ripped
down.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is currently considering legislation that would change
some of those rules.

 &HT;    Grapevine's Reilly believes in industry
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ From his eighth floor office, Wendell Reilly has a
sweeping view of a landscape dotted with construction cranes.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta enclave Buckhead, rapidly growing again, is a work in
progress and so is Reilly's TV station holding company and the
industry he's investing in.
</P>
<P>
   In the past three weeks, Reilly's Grapevine Communications has
spent $250 million to buy 11 TV stations nationwide. The purchases
have more than doubled the size of the company's holdings to 18
stations and tripled its annual cash flow to $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   And Reilly, chairman and founder of Grapevine, isn't done yet.
Indeed, he's stepping up the pace. Reilly is moving from buying
stations in places like Casper, Wyo., to richer markets such as
Huntsville, Ala., where he bought the ABC affiliate last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``My original plan was to buy 12 stations,'' says Reilly. ``I'm
way past that now. And there's no set limitations on the stations
we may own.''
</P>
<P>
   Grapevine's rapid growth belies the troubled seas it is
navigating. The TV industry is in upheaval. The big networks are
demanding that their affiliates shoulder more of the cost for
producing prime time shows.
</P>
<P>
   And some of them are starting to compete with channels such as
ABC's Soap Opera network. This new channel would feature the same
soap operas as that of ABC's affiliates, giving new and unwanted
competition for a popular genre of shows.
</P>
<P>
   This competition comes as viewership continues to decline for
network television and the industry as a group must spend billions
of dollars to upgrade stations to handle digital signals.
</P>
<P>
   ``TV is not what it used to be,'' says Reilly. ``It's going
through a rough time.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Reilly believes network television remains the single
best way for advertisers to reach a mass audience. The networks and
their affiliate stations remain the single largest slices of a
greatly fragmented pie, he says.
</P>
<P>
   It was that belief that led Reilly, whose background is in
outdoor advertising, to begin investing in the TV industry. He has
taken a contrarian approach, focusing on the small to mid-sized
stations ignored by the huge media conglomerates gobbling up
stations in big cities.
</P>
<P>
   Grapevine is not alone in this strategy. Others, including Gray
Communications Systems, have also bought up stations below the
radar of the big TV holding companies.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly's first deal was in 1997, when he bought a station in
Anchorage, Alaska. Reilly didn't start out with any capital but
soon earned the interest of an investment group in Teaneck, N.J.,
called BCI Advisors.
</P>
<P>
   BCI has a 15-year history of investing in TV and radio stations.
It also specializes in backing midsized businesses.
</P>
<P>
   For Reilly, it was a natural fit. ``The company was the smart
money in TV,'' Reilly says. ``BCI understands the market, its risks
and knows how to invest wisely.''
</P>
<P>
   In his polo shirt with a PGA logo, Reilly does not look the
dealmaker. Yet this is indeed his specialty. He enjoys telling how
he clinched a deal for a station in Savannah, one of his first,
with a handshake.
</P>
<P>
   ``My investors couldn't believe it, but that handshake held for
four months,'' says Reilly. ``The owner promised me he wouldn't
change the terms or sell to someone else and he didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   With this old-fashioned charm, Reilly has targeted family-owned
stations. He lavishes owners with the attention bigger players
wouldn't bother with. ``A big company would rather pursue a group
of six stations rather than just one,'' says Reilly.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly wants to focus even more on dealmaking. That's the
driving logic behind Grapevine's recently announced acquisition of
GOCOM, a Charlotte, N.C.-based company that owns 10 stations.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the $185 million merger will create a new company
with headquarter operations split between Charlotte and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   From Charlotte, GOCOM will handle management of all the
stations. Entrepreneur Ric Gorman, who will become chief executive
of the new company, runs GOCOM. His specialty is managing stations.
``Ric is a builder and he invests in sales,'' says Reilly.
</P>
<P>
   What he means is that GOCOM builds up a station's sales staff,
invests in training and also spends heavily on station promotion.
</P>
<P>
   In buying GOCOM, Grapevine is also getting Terry Segal, who once
ran the TBS Superstation. He is now head of TV programming for
GOCOM.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly will remain in Atlanta with his small staff. ``I'm the
deal guy,'' says Reilly. ``I will go and find more stations.''

 &HT;    MindSpring aims to be No. 2 Net provider
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Charles Brewer, chairman and chief executive of
MindSpring Enterprises, has a simple goal for his company. After
America Online, he would like MindSpring to be the second-largest
Internet service provider in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before the annual shareholders meeting at Atlanta's
High Museum, he spoke with his usual wit and conviction about the
future of both his company and the Internet in general.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer made it clear that MindSpring is first and foremost an
Internet access provider _ that is, a very big and influential
Internet access provider.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer said the firm needed to be big to meet its goals,
including potential media partnerships, lobbying for last-mile
access in Washington and making further acquisitions that will push
the company into the coveted No. 2 position ahead of AT&AMP;T and the
Microsoft Network.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, Brewer had suggested that Microsoft might eventually
want to sell off its dial-up access service, and if that happened,
MindSpring would definitely be interested. No deals have
transpired.
</P>
<P>
   However, Jupiter Communications analyst Mark Mooridan won't rule
out the possibility. ``Microsoft's core business is not access,''
he says. ``The MSN network barely exists anymore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer expounded on what would keep his ISP in business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest key to our strategy is superior service and
support,'' he said. ``It's a great time for us to grow. Seventy
percent of households are not connected, but they will be, and
sooner than you might think.'' He stressed the company's goal to
continue growing, but not at the expense of service and support
that is the company's hallmark.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts are still wondering how MindSpring will spend
the more than $500 million it raised in a stock offering this year.
Brewer outlined several ways to leverage his 1.2 million-customer
base. This includes expanding its Web hosting and business services
division, forming partnerships and alliances with e-commerce and
media partners to optimize the MindSpring homepage, and possibly
dabbling in other telecommunications offerings.
</P>
<P>
   The company is also considering ways to provide international
access for MindSpring subscribers, but right now that type of
service is unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the Internet access business evolves beyond dial-up
phone lines into cable modems and DSL high-speed phone service,
Brewer said MindSpring's core business will always be connecting
users to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The job we have at MindSpring, that is connecting people to
the Internet won't change,'' Brewer said. ``But it will become more
involved.''

 &HT;    MindSpring sets 2-for-1 stock split
 &HT;    By Frances Katz

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ MindSpring Enterprises, whose stock price has been
steadily dropping over the past few weeks, announced a 2-for-1
stock split Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders at the close of business June 11 will receive one
additional share of MindSpring common stock for each share held.
Distribution of the additional shares will take place June 25.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring stock has fallen from a 52-week high of $133 on April
13 to its Tuesday close of $69.
</P>
<P>
   While the company's stock has surged during the last 12 months,
it has increased just 13 percent since the beginning of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The stock dip is part of a larger Wall Street sell-off of
technology stocks, which have been in free fall over the last few
weeks. However, many companies, including Theglobe.com and
interactive advertising service DoubleClick, have seen their shares
rise after announcing stock splits.
</P>
<P>
   The split came immediately following the approval by MindSpring
shareholders at their annual meeting Tuesday of a proposal to
increase the number of outstanding shares. Currently, 30.7 million
shares of MindSpring stock are outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the this action will help widen the distribution
and enhance the marketability of MindSpring's common stock,'' said
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Charles Brewer.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the split will bring the price per share of
MindSpring's common stock and the company's number of shares
outstanding into a range that should generate increased interest
from current and new shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Investors tend to snap up shares after split announcements,
hoping they'll see a rise in the stock price.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sort of range of stock prices that we think is
ideal, and since people do like to trade in round lots, this split
makes it practical for more investors and more small investors,''
he said.

IMPOVERISHED ALBANIA COPES WITH YET ANOTHER CRISIS

<TEXT>
<P>
   TIRANA, Albania _ As spooky reminders of a dark, suspicious,
past, more than 500,000 Communist-era bunkers still poke through
the ground throughout Albania.
</P>
<P>
   The mushroom-shaped pillboxes were built in the 1970s as a
defense against foreign invasion. And some of them are finally
being used _ as protective barriers around the NATO encampments
that have been welcomed here during the campaign against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The bunkers were once symbols of Albania's isolation and
paranoia, but they had been reduced to mere curiosities, with cheap
marble replicas sold in tourist shops.
</P>
<P>
   The transformation from communist outpost to a member of the
European community of nations has not been easy. Albania remains
Europe's poorest country and has suffered through one crisis after
another.
</P>
<P>
   With its economy demolished and many of its roads and public
buildings crumbling, the country slid into anarchy in 1997
following the collapse of a gigantic pyramid scheme in which huge
numbers of Albanians had invested.
</P>
<P>
   And now there is a new crisis. Since March 24, more than half a
million Kosovo refugees have flooded in, increasing Albania's
population by 15 percent and placing enormous strain on its
resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone thought that Albania had reached bottom two years
ago,'' said Piro Misha, a leading Albanian political scientist.
``But now we are realizing that the bottom was actually much, much
deeper.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials estimate that its cost for the refugee
crisis so far exceeds $150 million, an enormous amount in a country
where the average monthly salary of a government worker is $71.
With a war nearby and the government preoccupied, international
commercial trade and privatization have ground to a halt, and
budding private investments have dried up.
</P>
<P>
   But the crisis is also exacting a great price on Albania's
fragile political system. The center-left government of Prime
Minister Pandeli Majko has been roundly criticized by nationalist
opposition forces for handing over control of Albania's air space
and military bases to NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The government, elected last October with a reputation for not
abiding corruption, has openly sided with the separatist Albanian
rebel group from Kosovo, the Kosovo Liberation Army, and allows it
to operate freely in Albania. Yugoslavia has retaliated with
incursions across the northern border.
</P>
<P>
   The newspapers are filled with rumors that the political
factions that attempted a coup last September will try again.
</P>
<P>
   ``This government is so weak it could be overthrown by 200
people,'' said Fatos Lubonja, a prominent intellectual who spent 17
years as a political prisoner. But, he said, ``If there is any
stability here, it derives from the fact that there is no better
alternative than the government we have now.''
</P>
<P>
   During Albania's 50 years of communism, totalitarian control was
more complete than in other communist state. ``Albania was isolated
for so long that it was left without immunization to corruption,
political manipulation and the excesses of the open market,'' said
Misha, the political analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in other communist countries, no dissident movement
emerged, and after the collapse all the new parties were composed
of disguised Communists.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Sali Berisha, whose government fell after the
pyramid disaster, is believed to have been behind last September's
attempted coup, and analysts say he could try again at any sign of
instability in Tirana.
</P>
<P>
   There is an expectation here that the West will ante up
substantial amounts of aid to help Albania and the entire Balkans
region rebuild after the conflict in Kosovo ends. Such an effort,
like the Marshall Plan for Europe after World War II, is seen as
especially important to Albania because it could provide money and
guidance for building democratic government structures.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the West is serious about stability in the Balkans, it will
have to get serious about stability in Albania,'' said Erin Saberi,
an independent political consultant and former director of the
Albanian office of the nonprofit National Democratic Institute for
International Affairs, which is based in Washington. ``There are
signs that the West does see Albania as important, but there also
are signs that it is still seen as a small, irrelevant, wild
outpost.''
</P>
<P>
   The primary concern about pouring aid into Albania would be to
ensure that in a place known for criminal activity and corruption,
the money would not be siphoned off.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``Corruption is so widespread here that people think this is a
normal part of life,'' said Lubonja, the former political prisoner.
In a survey conducted for the World Bank last year, 40 percent of
respondents here said it was necessary to bribe officials to get
health care. And a recent study by the Albanian Center on Economic
research found that the majority of companies spent more than 5
percent of revenues on corruption.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just payoffs and bribes. Every apartment building
has a field of satellite television dishes, but nobody pays fees
for the signals. Water and electricity bills routinely go unpaid.
</P>
<P>
   Stolen luxury cars are sold openly, and markets across Albania
carry cheap knock-offs of brand names, such as Panper's diapers,
with packages made to resemble those of Pampers, and Cola-Cola
bottles that are hard to tell from Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   When the pyramid schemes collapsed, images of Albanian mobs
armed with automatic rifles stolen from state armories were seen
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   But the country's unconditional acceptance of Kosovo Albanian
refugees is softening that image. In contrast, neighboring
Macedonia has repeatedly closed its border with Kosovo and
threatened to ship out the refugees because the government fears
their presence will disturb the country's delicate ethnic balance.
</P>
<P>
   Albania is one of the newest countries in Europe _ it emerged
from 400 years of Turkish rule in 1912 _ but its people are among
the oldest. Albanians are descendants of the ancient Ilyrians, here
before the Roman conquest.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian-speaking Muslims of Kosovo share a common language
and substantial cultural bonds with the 3.3 million people of
Albania. But after two months, some of the initial generosity and
brotherhood have started to fade.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks ago, Ermal Shllaku, an unemployed 29-year-old miner in
the northern city of Kukes, took in Gani Berisha and his family
when they arrived, penniless, from Kosovo. Fourteen people now live
in Shllaku's two-room apartment.
</P>
<P>
   He has not charged Berisha rent, but he knows that other
Albanians have demanded up to $700 a month. ``We Albanians want to
get rich in an instant,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ilber Shaku, a plumbing inspector in Kukes, sees nothing wrong
with charging refugees rent, although he does not do so himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here had almost nothing,'' he said. ``This is a chance
to make money. But if you look at all of Albania, everyone steals,
from the government on down. So really, this is nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Albania is a small country, accustomed to living with big
powers. Italy occupied it in 1939, then German forces in 1943.
Communists seized power in 1944, but in 1968, it broke with the
Soviet Union and turned to China. In 1972, Albania severed ties
with China and withdrew into almost total isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Now it has applied for membership to the World Trade
Organization, and the great majority of Albanians fully support
NATO and want the alliance to remain after the Kosovo conflict
ends.
</P>
<P>
   For many of them, accepting another power, personified in
ordinary conversation as ``Boba'' _ or father _ Clinton, is not a
threat but a chance to set things straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The image of Albania in the world is of poverty, corruption
and illegality,'' Misha said. ``We want to create something
different but we know that we need some help to make the change.''

FAXON BREAKS WRIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brad Faxon's weekend at home was supposed to be a break from the
PGA Tour as he recharged for a tough stretch that would include the
US Open.
</P>
<P>
   What he got instead was a broken left wrist that will keep him
sidelined 6-8 weeks, which means he is out of next month's Open at
Pinehurst No. 2. Faxon, 37, fell from a ladder at his home in
Barrington, R.I., and landed on his wrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll probably have a cast on for 3-4 weeks,'' said Faxon's
agent, Greg Able of Pros Inc. ``Right now, the target date (for a
return) is probably the British Open (July 15-18).''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Faxon was at his home course last Thursday to watch
some of the action in the NCAA East Regional golf championships. He
was coming off a couple of solid efforts (T-13 at Greensboro, T-18
at the Byron Nelson) and feeling good about his game. Even the
Ryder Cup was on his mind, though he ranks 131st in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a long shot,'' he said, ``but it would mean winning twice
and playing well in the majors.''
</P>
<P>
   Faxon and fellow Rhode Islander Billy Andrade will host the CVS
Charity Classic Aug. 1-3 at Rhode Island CC. The event will feature
18 other members of the PGA and Senior PGA Tours.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a faltering, hesitant voice, Justin A. Volpe
admitted Tuesday that he rammed a stick into Abner Louima's rectum
and then thrust it in his face, an act, the police officer
acknowledged, intended to humiliate and intimidate the handcuffed
Haitian immigrant.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you tell anybody about this, I'll find you and kill you,''
Volpe said he told Louima moments after the Aug. 9, 1997, assault
in the bathroom of the 70th precinct house in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   By pleading guilty, Volpe hoped to be spared a life sentence for
the assault that cast a shadow on the entire New York Police
Department. But while he offered chilling details about acts he has
long denied, Volpe did not implicate any other officers by name,
even though four others are still on trial in the case.
</P>
<P>
   As he confessed to six federal crimes, Volpe at times struggled
for words when pressed to explain the forces that compelled him to
torture Louima.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you put the stick up towards his face, having shoved it
into his rectum, was that a part of your effort to humiliate him?''
U.S. District Judge Eugene H. Nickerson asked at one point, his
tone quietly insistent.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe paused, then said, ``I was in shock at the time, your
honor.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge repeated the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe what happened,'' Volpe said, again seeming
to fumble. And then: ``I was mad.''
</P>
<P>
   Still unsatisfied, Nickerson tried once more. ``You intended to
humiliate him?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Volpe finally said, averting his eyes from the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe, 27, wept but once, at the end of the 45-minute hearing
when he said to Nickerson, ``Your honor, if I could just let the
record reflect I'm sorry for hurting my family.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge cut him off. ``You'll get a chance to do that when you
come to sentence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe wiped the tears from his eyes, and then turned and looked
into the audience for his most outspoken defender, his father,
Robert Volpe, a retired New York police detective once renowned for
solving art thefts. The son managed a weak smile to his father as
security officers led him from the courtroom and took him into
custody.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are all different kinds of hell,'' Robert Volpe said
later. ``It's not easy seeing your son taken away.''
</P>
<P>
   Volpe did not apologize to Louima, but his lawyer, Marvyn M.
Kornberg, said he was clearly remorseful. ``When you plead guilty,
I think that's a sufficient apology,'' Kornberg said. ``The man's
facing life.''
</P>
<P>
   Even by throwing himself to the mercy of the court, Volpe at
best faces a minimum of 30 years in a federal prison, his lawyers
said. He also could be fined up to $1.5 -million for violating
Louima's civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   No sentencing date was set.
</P>
<P>
   The plea was seized on by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani as evidence
that the Police Department had turned a corner in its battle with
corruption and brutality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It destroys the myth of the blue wall of silence,'' the mayor
said, alluding to the testimony of Volpe's fellow officers, who
described how Volpe had boasted of the attack after carrying it
out.
</P>
<P>
   Louima was not in court to hear Volpe's guilty plea, but his
cousin, the Rev. Samuel Nicolas, spoke for the family Tuesday,
telling reporters outside the court: ``We just like to thank God
for keeping Abner alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Pastor Nicolas also thanked federal prosecutors and he asked for
healing.He said the Louima family ``looks forward for the rest of
justice to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the four other officers also charged in the case
will return to court as their trial continues. Their lawyers were
conferring with Judge Nickerson Tuesday to decide how best to
explain to jurors Volpe's sudden exit without tainting any juror's
impression of the evidence against the remaining defendants.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We're obviously very pleased with today's development,'' U.S.
Attorney Zachary W. Carter said, declining to say much more because
the trial is continuing.
</P>
<P>
   The courtroom was so crowded for Volpe's plea that when Robert
Volpe entered, one of the few remaining seats was a few feet down
from Carter. Volpe squeezed in; Carter stood up and moved across
the aisle to another spot.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty minutes before the appointed hour, Justin Volpe slipped
into the courtroom through a side door. Accompanied by his lawyers
and several police officers, he appeared relaxed and polished.
</P>
<P>
   He had spent the night at his parents' home in Staten Island,
eating with with mother and father, visiting with his girlfriend,
as a e half-dozen watchful law enforcement officials decamped
outside with a couple of hecklers. In court, he chatted amiably
with his lawyers and his private investigator.
</P>
<P>
   But minutes before Nickerson walked in, Volpe searched the court
for his father, who, along with an uncle, were the only relatives
to attend the hearing. When their eyes met, Robert Volpe gave him a
smile, and then a clerk called out, ``United States of America
versus Justin Volpe.'' Volpe's poise then began to fade.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by his lawyers, he faced Nickerson, who peered back over
half-glasses and showed none of his usual wit. Nickerson asked him
if he understood what he was about to do, and Volpe, in a low and
throaty voice, said he did.
</P>
<P>
   When the moment of confession arrived, Volpe reached into his
jacket and pulled out a one-page statement. He took several deep
breaths, and rocked back and forth, and read the words until he got
to the phrase, ``I sodomized ...'' Then he paused. Then he took
another breath. Then he sniffled and finished the sentence: ``...
Mr. Louima by placing a stick in his rectum.''
</P>
<P>
   In the audience, his father's eyes were red, and he kept pulling
at his mustache and stroking his chin and rubbing the bridge of his
nose.

SNYDER GETS TO BUY REDSKINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dan Snyder, a 34-year-old PR man from Washington,
received Tuesday what few people in the NFL get. He got Al Davis's
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder officialy became the owner of the Washington Redskins
after his $800 million bid was approved by a unanimous 31-0 vote of
the league's owners. That ended a year-old soap opera over the
future of the franchise that began with the death of Jack Kent
Cooke and ended with his son being effectively cut out of the
team's future by his father's will.
</P>
<P>
   That will stipulated the team be sold to the highest bidder to
fund a charitable foundation, but Cooke never had any idea it would
cost his son the team because of the skyrocketing valuations of NFL
franchises in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   John Kent Cooke, who has run the Redskins' day-to-day operation
in recent years for his father, was unable to match an $800 million
offer from Howard Milstein, with whom Snyder was a minority
partner. But Milstein was unable to receive league approval and
finally withdrew his offer and is suing the league and Redskin
management, claiming the latter worked to submarine his efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder continued to press his own cause, forming a new
partnership that includes Boston businessman Mort Zuckerman and
Fred Drasner, co-publisher of the New York Daily News. Together
they made their own $800 million offer and were quickly approved
both by the trustees of Cooke's estate and the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an unbelieveable journey,'' Snyder said Tuesday.
``This has been a lifelong dream. I am a huge fan. It's that
simple.''
</P>
<P>
   It may have been simple but it wasn't cheap. The 'Skins brought
the highest price ever for an NFL team and one of the highest in
the history of professional sports, dwarfed only by the recent sale
of Manchester United's soccer team for &UR;  &LR; $1 billion. It also brought
headaches and disappointments during the long months Milstein's
group was in negotiations, especially after it successfully outbid
Cooke's $680 million offer only to see the owners make clear they
would reject his bid if he brought it forward.
</P>
<P>
   When Milstein withdrew the offer last month, Snyder said his
dream of owning his childhood team remained intact and he
immediately began forming a new group with himself as the lead
owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``To fulfill my dream, I needed to get together with some
people,'' Snyder said. ``I stayed in the hotel and made a few calls
and said I'd press on. Within a week or two after that things came
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Drasner, who was on hand with Snyder Tuesday, had been a
financial supporter of Snyder's business efforts dating back to
their first meeting 13 years ago. At that time, Snyder was trying
to start a fledgling advertising and public relations firm that
would quickly grow into Snyder Communications, a firm now listed on
the New York Stock Exchange. Drasner financially backed that effort
and Snyder's latest one as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I backed him 13 years ago because I thought he was a winner,''
Drasner said. ``Hopefully I'll be a passive investor and just yell
and scream at him when I think he made a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Davis did not think Snyder is a mistake. The Oakland
Raiders' managing general partner has in recent years abstained
from many major league votes to protect what he sees as his own
legal rights but Tuesday he joined the crowd, throwing his support
behind the NFL's youngest owner.
</P>
<P>
   Davis and his partners also heard presentations from the two
groups vying for ownership of the league's expansion franchise in
Los Angeles. Initially, each was to give a presentation to the
Expansion Committee on how it would solve expected parking problems
at a refurbished LA Coliseum, but both sides unexpectedly were
asked to make a second presentation Tuesday morning to the full
ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood movie executive Michael Ovitz presented a stadium plan
that includes 27,000 parking spaces within the Coliseum Park area
that would cost an estimated $200 million. The stadium would be
rebuilt on top of a raised parking garage. The $200 million price
tag would be on top of the estimated $300 million price of
remodeling the stadium itself.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz also addressed a major concern of the league, which is the
apparent apathy of Los Angeles's sports fans toward the return of
NFL football to LA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not 100 percent convinced LA will embrace NFL football,''
Ovitz said. ``I think people are pretty fed up with NFL football
(after both the Rams and Raiders abandoned southern California in
recent years). We have to bring the fans back. We have to give them
something to root for and we have to make it easy for people to
come there and feel good there. We have to relight their fire.''
</P>
<P>
   That apathy is what two spokesmen for the New Coliseum Partners,
Ovitz's competition for ownership, said is the reason why the NFL
should adopt their stadium and parking plan over Ovitz's. It is
their opinion that a more modest parking proposal, which will use
existing lots and garages as well as building a new garage to bring
total parking within three-quarters of a mile of the Coliseum to
28,500, would cost only $67.5 million, and is more in line with
what can be reasonably financed.
</P>
<P>
   They offered the league's owners three parking plans, one of
which was all underground and cost an estimated $240 million, a
second that was a combination of above and below ground for $193
million, plus the less expensive model they favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our presentation was about certainty,'' said John Semcken,
executive vice president of New Coliseum Partners. ``I hope this
doesn't come down to who has the best parking. Our main concern is
the league will pick a plan that can't be done and will hurt
football in Los Angeles down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Semcken declined to say specifically that his group did not
believe Ovitz could adequately finance his proposal with a $200
million cost for parking spaces, but his belief in that was clear.
</P>
<P>
   The final day of meetings will address both a proposal to move
the kickoff back to the 25-yard line and the New England Patriots'
stadium financing request. Owner Robert Kraft expects a vote will
be taken to approve a $112.5 million league-backed loan to defray
half the cost of building a new stadium in Foxborough, Mass. that
he hopes will be ready within two years.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of that loan, a first under a new NFL policy designed to
help finance a portion of new stadiums in urban centers, is not
expected to meet much opposition.

UT'S CHRIS MIHM BEEFING UP TO BECOME THE BEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The halls of the Moncrief-Neuhaus Athletic
Center at the south end of Royal-Memorial Stadium on the University
of Texas campus are quiet on this spring day.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the spacious Al-Rashid Strength Complex, even the
ceiling-mounted surround-sound speakers that usually fill the
weight-training facility with a cacophony of music are silent.
</P>
<P>
   This is, however, another intense workday for Longhorns center
Chris Mihm and strength-and-conditioning coach Todd Wright, whom
basketball coach Rick Barnes says is the best there is at what he
does.
</P>
<P>
   Wright prods the 7-foot Mihm through a series of exercises that
include the inclined bench press using dumbbells, the standing push
press, squats, the dumbbell lunge-walk and a series of what Wright
calls ``prehab'' exercises that are designed to prevent injury.
</P>
<P>
   Each drill, each movement is specifically tailored for the
player whom many expect to blossom next season into one of college
basketball's best. This is a scene Mihm and Wright will repeatedly
reprise over the course of the summer. Other than to take time out
this week to try out for the World University Games U.S. team, Mihm
plans to spend a major portion of the next three months working
with Wright. Tryouts for the July 3-12 games begin Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Both relish the prospect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris has unbelievable genetic potential,'' said Wright, who
came to Texas with Barnes last spring. ``I've never been with a
young man who has developed as fast as he has.''
</P>
<P>
   Their unabashed goal is to build college basketball's next
player of the year.
</P>
<P>
   To date, Mihm has added 12 pounds of muscle since last season.
He weighs 275 pounds and has not lost any of his agility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm ready to go out and try to dominate next season,''
said Mihm, a consensus all-Big 12 selection and the Star-Telegram
conference player of the year last year as a sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   ``\RBeing national player of the year\S has been one of my goals
since I came to Texas. I've put in my dues the last two years, but
I'm still working hard every day. And when you do that, good things
come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to try to make a run at taking this team to the
Final Four and winning a national championship. If the
player-of-the-year honor comes, then that would be fantastic, a
dream come true. But it's something I definitely want to achieve.
It's something to reach for.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is a goal that Barnes openly encourages _ rather than
hem and haw with the common line that team goals come first, etc.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want Chris Mihm to be player of the year,'' Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, team success might follow, rather than the other
way around.
</P>
<P>
   Mihm, forward Gabe Muoneke and point guard Ivan Wagner return.
Sophomore forward Chris Owens _ whom Barnes likens to Muoneke _
comes off a redshirt transfer season. Three highly rated freshmen
and two junior-college shooting guards will join the roster of the
defending Big 12 regular-season champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to have a fantastic team,'' Mihm said.
</P>
<P>
   With the talent influx, Barnes should be able to field a team
that can put more pressure on those who try to double- and
triple-team Mihm. But Barnes is not just depending on the addition
of some shooters with outside range. He's already training a new
perimeter player: Chris Mihm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not just going to put Chris on the low block and say this
is where you need to play,'' Barnes said. ``That's one of the
easiest things to do to help the other team, because they can
always find him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris is going to open his game up. We know he's effective
inside, but he's also good facing the basket. I want to see him
shoot some threes and put the ball on the floor more effectively.
The way we're working right now, he'll do that next year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot to work on,'' Mihm said. ``But it's been a fun
change of pace.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes showed Mihm a newspaper article that discussed possible
NBA player-of-the-year candidates. Mentioned was the consistency of
Karl Malone, the intensity of Alonzo Mourning, the versatility of
Tim Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see Chris Mihm put all those things together,''
Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   Mihm is 19, but there is a new look of maturity about him. The
youthful expression has transformed into that of a young man _
ready to accept the responsibility of leadership, the burden of
great expectation that comes with a declared lofty goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pick goals some may say are far-fetched,'' Mihm said. ``But
so far, I've achieved everything I ever set for myself. If you set
them high, and reach for them, that's the only way to go to really
make yourself go anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Mihm around the rim Among Texas center Chris Mihm's
accomplishments last season are: _ Selected /{Fort Worth
Star-Telegram/} Big 12 Player of the Year, consensus
all-conference, /{Kansas City Star/} all-improved, all-defensive
squads, NABC all-District 9, USBWA all-District 7, honorable
mention Associated Press All-American. _ Ranked fourth nationally
in rebounding (11.0), 17th in blocked shots (2.6 per game). _
Averaged 13.7 points, 11 rebounds _ 21 points and 14 rebounds in
three postseason (Big 12, NCAA) tournament games. + Achieved 19
double-doubles, 16 in the last 21 games when he averaged 14.8
points and 12.6 rebounds and Texas went 16-5.

THOUSANDS OF REFUGEES CONTINUE TO POUR INTO MACEDONIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACE, Macedonia _ More than 4,500 ethnic Albanians fled into
Macedonia on Tuesday, including hundreds of women from the town of
Kacanik in southeastern Kosovo, many of whom accused Serbian forces
of separating hundreds of fighting-age men from their group before
expelling them.
</P>
<P>
   Almost no men between the ages of 15 and 50 were among the group
from Kacanik that arrived at a remote border crossing in the
village of Jazince. The Kosovo Liberation Army, the separatist
guerrilla force fighting for Kosovo's independence, has been active
in villages around Kacanik. Serbian forces have been particularly
brutal in areas with KLA activity, in some cases executing all the
men of fighting age who they capture. A busload of refugees from
Pristina who also arrived on Tuesday at Jazince reported that
Serbian paramilitaries are continuing to terrorize and expel ethnic
Albanians from the provincial capital, a once bustling, cafe-filled
city of 250,000.
</P>
<P>
   In the largest influx of refugees in three weeks, nearly 25,000
refugees, most of them from Pristina, have poured into Macedonia in
the last five days, filling refugee camps to near capacity and
exacerbating tension in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   At the main border crossing here in the village of Blace, more
than 3,000 refugees crossed the border on Tuesday and newly
arriving refugees reported that there are thousands of other ethnic
Albanians just behind them, aid workers said. Many of the people
who crossed from Yugoslavia were members of a group of several
thousand men, women and children from Pristina who had actually
arrived at the other side of the border on Monday and spent a
miserable night sleeping outside in drizzling rain, spread across
roads and sidewalks. At least one elderly man died in the cold
during the night, refugees said, and an elderly women and two
children died on a sweltering, overcrowded train from Pristina on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what was happening on the other side of the border in
the town of Deneral Jankovic, a normally sleepy settlement of
roughly 7,000 people, was unclear. Some refugees said they had
heard that no trains and buses arrived from Pristina on Tuesday,
which might indicate an attempt by Yugoslav officials to allow the
refugees clogging Deneral Jankovic's streets to move on before
others arrive.
</P>
<P>
   But other refugees said they heard that trains and buses had
arrived, indicating that thousands more refugees would spend
another night exposed to the elements.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been reports that as many as three more trains came
today,'' Ron Redmond, a spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees, said Tuesday night. ``But we really don't know what
is going on in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Fatmir Zenjullahu, 26, who slept outside with his wife and three
children, 5, 3 and 1, on the main asphalt road leading out of
Kosovo Monday night, said conditions in Deneral Jankovic were
``horrible.'' He and other refugees said the few houses in the town
were packed with up to 100 refugees each and they dared not sleep
in nearby fields because of rumors of mines.

COURT OKS ALLMERICA SETTLEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Putting to rest an episode in which it purportedly led customers
to buy life insurance policies they did not need, Allmerica
Financial Corp. received final court approval Tuesday for a
settlement with policyholders who had sued over deceptive sales
practices.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which requires the Worcester, Mass. insurer to spend
up to $31 million compensating the owners of 400,000 policies
issued over a 10-year period, represents the latest action against
an insurer accused of fraudulent practices. ``They were not the
first company to get involved in this and now its over and behind
them,'' said analyst Ira L. Zuckerman of Nutmeg Securities, Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The approval, by the US District Court in Worcester, formalizes
a preliminary agreement reached in December between Allmerica and
four policyholders who had filed a class-action suit asserting that
nearly every life policy that Allmerica peddled from 1978 to
mid-1998 was sold deceptively.
</P>
<P>
   The group said Allmerica agents misleadingly encouraged
policyholders to use their old certificates to trade up to newer,
more expensive ones, and that agents wrongly promised that life
insurance premiums would diminish over time. The company originally
estimated that it sold 450,000 policies over the period, but
recently revised the figure downward.
</P>
<P>
   Allmerica's chief spokesman, Michael Buckley, denied the company
had engaged in wrongdoing but said it had decided to resolve the
matter in court ``because it was in the best interest of
policyholders, shareholders, and the company.'' Allmerica rose 5/8
Tuesday to close at 56 on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the settlement, Allmerica will allow 400,000
aggrieved policyholders two options: to buy discounted life
insurance or annuities (insurance that makes payments to the holder
over time); or to present their cases to an independent referee,
who will determine compensation and benefits. The company could end
up spending more than the $31 million it has reserved for the
settlement if many policyholders choose the latter path.
</P>
<P>
   In the biggest deceptive sales practices settlement, Prudential
Insurance Co. of America, the nation's largest life insurer, will
pay up to $2 billion to compensate 8 million policyholders. Other
big life insurers, including John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co.
of Boston, have settled similar suits in recent years.

Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by calling (888) CHINA DEFENDS ITS HONOR ON SPYING CHARGES  (jw) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Accusations that Chinese spies stole nuclear weapon
designs and missile technology from the United States are ``totally
groundless,'' China's Foreign Ministry said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The espionage charges are fabrications by ``people with ulterior
motives'' who hope to divert attention from NATO's bombing campaign
in Yugoslavia and the attack on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade,
said Zhu Bangzao, the ministry spokesman, at a regularly scheduled
news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu spoke hours before the official release in Washington of the
report by a congressional committee that described suspected
Chinese operations to steal some of the most advanced American
military technologies. As of late Wednesday night, there was no
further official reaction to the report. But the Chinese denials
and countercharges have been repeatedly stated over many months, as
details of the spy accusations and the committee's conclusions have
dribbled out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people in the United States stubbornly cling to a Cold
War mentality, are full of bias and hostility toward China and have
tried in all possible ways to create rumors about China,'' Zhu
said. ``Their goal is to spread the theory of a `China threat' and
divert attention from the embassy bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Chinese officials and scholars say they have deeply
resented continuing reports in the American press of accusations
about China _ first that it tried to influence American elections
with bribes, then that it stole nuclear warhead designs. None of
the charges has been proved, they note.
</P>
<P>
   Few details of the allegations have been published in the
official press here, and many people seem to accept the
government's assertion that American foes of China have
orchestrated a campaign to discredit the country.
</P>
<P>
   Anger over the spy charges was among the litany of complaints
about American treachery cited by scholars and students here in
recent weeks as they tried to explain the outpouring of harsh
anti-American feelings after the May 7 bombing of the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese pride has also been hurt by the suggestion that their
own scientists could not develop advanced nuclear warheads on their
own. In recent months, prominent elder scientists have been
interviewed in the official press describing China's past
achievements in developing nuclear weapons and missiles.
</P>
<P>
   China's nuclear forces are tiny compared with those of the
United States and Russia and rely on outdated, vulnerable
fixed-site missile launchers. American military analysts believe
that in the coming decade China will start deploying smaller,
advanced warheads on mobile missiles, improving their ability to
evade destruction in an enemy attack and retaliate.
</P>
<P>
   Some American intelligence officers, supported by the
congressional committee, believe that China's quest for such
improved warheads and missiles has been greatly aided by espionage.
Other intelligence officials say this is unproved.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the origins, if China deploys larger, more accurate
nuclear forces, then its ability to threaten American allies and
troops during a crisis in Asia will be enhanced, American military
experts say.

CHINA SPYING CONTROVERSY BECOMES AN INSTANT CAMPAIGN ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A bipartisan House report concluding that China has
stolen many of the country's most coveted nuclear secrets became an
instant campaign issue Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans issued withering assaults on the administration's
handling of suspicions, going back to 1995, that the Chinese were
receiving classified material from American nuclear weapons
laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks indirectly targeted Vice President Al Gore, one of
President Clinton's closest advisers and the Democratic frontrunner
campaigning to replace him.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican frontrunner, quickly
issued a statement in response to the 700-page House report,
attacking what he called ``the administration's failed policies
toward China.''
</P>
<P>
   The spying has ``dramatically accelerated China's emergence as a
major nuclear power,'' Bush said. ``The implications are huge for
the balance of power in Asia and for the balance of power in the
rest of the world.'' Bush especially faulted the administration's
long-held stance toward China as a ``strategic partner,'' a
position that Gore has stoutly defended.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is not America's strategic partner,'' Bush said. ``China
is a competitor which does not share our values, but now,
unfortunately shares many of our nuclear secrets.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore made no reply to the GOP attacks, but his office aides
directed reporters to the White House for a response.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, speaking in Texas, said his administration
was ``moving aggressively to tighten security'' at the nuclear
weapons labs. He added, ``We have a solemn obligation to protect
such national security information and we have to do more to do
it.'' But the president also insisted that the administration would
continue dealing with China on a range of matters because, he said,
that, too, was in the national interest.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, noting the report's conclusion
that China also stole military technology during the Ronald Reagan
and George Bush administrations, said, ``It would be a mistake to
attempt to use this report for political gain.''
</P>
<P>
   However, some Republican strategists hope to use national
security and foreign policy against Gore in the current campaign,
especially if the crisis in the Kosovo, now entering its third
month, drags on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer that we are involved in Kosovo, the more damage
that it, coupled with Chinese espionage, will do to Al Gore,'' said
Republican pollster Frank Luntz. ``When voters come to make that
final decision of who to elect president, these things do matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., a member of the House Intelligence
Committee, said the Clinton-Gore administration has taken steps
``to solve the security problems at the national labs.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans and the House report faulted the White House for
failing to react quickly to evidence of Chinese penetration of U.S.
weapons laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Hess, a political analyst with the Brookings
Institution, a nonpartisan think tank here, said that Gore, whether
he likes it or not, will have to defend the Clinton legacy as the
election nears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore is one of the most active vice presidents in U.S.
history,'' Hess pointed out. ``He can take partial credit for
things that have gone right in the last eight years. But he also
has to share the blame for things that went wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been heavily involved in foreign policy and national
security. He successfully urged Clinton to include large defense
spending boosts in his fiscal 2000 budget and has helped devise
policy on Russia, Bosnia, the Kosovo crisis and the 1994 invasion
of Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   National security last played a big role in a presidential
election in 1988, when the Cold War was still an issue. Then Vice
President George Bush, who had been CIA director and an envoy to
China, touted his foreign policy credentials and painted Democrat
Michael Dukakis as weak on defense.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, in 1980, Reagan successfully used the Iranian hostage
crisis as part of his campaign to unseat President Jimmy Carter.
Public unhappiness over the Vietnam War played a role in bringing
Richard Nixon to power in 1968 and in forcing Lyndon Johnson to
give up his quest for a second term.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, in 1964, Johnson had defeated Sen. Barry Goldwater,
R-Ariz., partly by successfully casting Goldwater as an an extreme
foreign policy hawk. And Dwight Eisenhower won the White House in
1952 in part by accusing the Democrats of losing China to communism
in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Ornstein, an analyst at the American Enterprise
Institute, another think tank here, said Republicans are searching
for viable campaign issues because they are getting ``trounced by
Democrats'' on gun control, crime, social security and the
management of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   But Ornstein said that while the China spying issue ``has the
potential to resonate with voters,'' there are ``caveats.'' For
instance, he said, if Gore isn't directly tied to the
administration's failure to halt the espionage, voters ``are likely
to discard the issue in the voting booth.''
</P>
<P>
   Hess agreed that voters aren't likely to pull a lever for the
Republican presidential nominee solely because of the spying. But
he added that the House report could become ``ongoing background
noise'' throughout the campaign that voters might connect to
scandals involving illegal Chinese contributions to the
Clinton-Gore campaign in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   According to the House report, China stole U.S. nuclear warhead
designs, advanced radar know-how and missile guidance system
blueprints dating to the late 1970s when Carter was president. The
report concludes that an ``insatiable appetite'' for U.S.
technology has allowed China to leap from a 1950s nuclear weapons
program to state-of-the-art designs ``on par with our own.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Besides Gov. Bush, other GOP presidential hopefuls and party
leaders fired their own salvos against the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said the House report underscores ``a
complete failure to effectively bring these breaches of security to
a halt. This is a disturbing report and one that is very damning to
the administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Publishing magnate Malcolm S. ``Steve'' Forbes said ``the
Clinton-Gore administration'' has ``demonstrated incompetence,
ineptitude, and insincerity on a scale never before witnessed in
the history of U.S. defense.'' Forbes also said ``the Clinton-Gore
administration'' should suspend effort to help China gain entry to
the World trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nicholson, the chairman of the Republican National
Committee, said he was ``sickened'' by the findings ``and appalled
that this administration's reaction was to drag its feet out of
fear of political embarrassment.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., the House Republican Conference
chairman, said that while the alleged spying also occurred under
Republican Presidents Reagan and George Bush, ``only the
Clinton-Gore campaign accepted millions in campaign contributions
from communist China while easing export restrictions on advanced
technology.''

HUNGARY FEELS SECURE DESPITE HOSTING US FIGHTERS, MARINES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   TASZAR, Hungary _ US fighter planes will be ready for takeoff by
the weekend to battle Yugoslav forces over the nearby southern
border, officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Although such an attack would bring the new NATO member closer
to the war, it is safer than ever, Hungarian and US officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hungary's security has only grown with its membership in
NATO,'' Hungarian Ministry of Defense State Secretary Lajos Fodor
said as he visited the air base here. ``The fact that US Marines
are deployed here only contributes to the stability.''
</P>
<P>
   Locals are a bit more nervous about the possibility of an
assault from their soil. While polls show Hungarians support the
NATO air strikes in general, a majority are skittish about the
launch of an attack from Hungary, fearing that Hungary will become
a Serbian target.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the border towns already can hear the booms from
NATO bombs on the Serb side of the border. They also worry about
the fate of some 400,000 ethnic Hungarians in Vojvodina, in
northern Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has made no
threats against Hungary, the only NATO member on the border of the
war zone.
</P>
<P>
   An all-out assault on Hungary would be suicidal for Milosevic,
since it would amount to a direct attack on all of NATO, said
Hungarian Air Force General Istvan Nemeth.
</P>
<P>
   Security at the border has been increased since the bombing
began, Hungarian officers said. Any potential attack on Hungary
from the south would be spotted by border guards or US or Hungarian
planes, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The stationing of the F-18s in Taszar means Yugoslavia is now
bordering four nations -- Hungary, Macedonia, Albania and Bosnia --
that have NATO troops and aircraft. Two other bordering countries,
Romania and Bulgaria, are members of NATO's Partnership for Peace.
</P>
<P>
   The F-18s can be used for several purposes, including defense of
other aircraft and direct attacks, officials said. ``We'll be ready
in a few days'' to begin operations if ordered, said a Marine
pilot, who also refused to be named.
</P>
<P>
   The base at Taszar already is home to some 500 American military
personnel who are using the base for Stabilization Force (SFOR)
operations in Bosnia, a grim reminder that the West's peace-keeping
troops are still needed in Bosnia, four years after the war there
ended.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the US presence on the base has dramatically increased,
with a reported 800 Marines on base as part of the NATO war effort.
</P>
<P>
   Nemeth acknowledged that the war was not what Hungary
anticipated when it joined the military alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, I didn't expect that on Day 12 after we joined NATO, we
would have this task to contend with,'' Nemeth said. ``As a
soldier, I was hoping for a peaceful resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, we know we have an obligation,'' Nemeth
said. ``That's why Hungary has authorized NATO to use its air
space.''

GROUP RECOMMENDS MENINGITIS VACCINATION FOR STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Melanie Bean of San Diego was an 18-year-old college student
when she got meningococcal meningitis, a raging infection that
destroyed her kidneys and left her with amputations of both arms
and legs.
</P>
<P>
   Evan Bozof was a junior at Georgia Southwestern University last
spring when meningitis struck. Twenty-six days later the college
athlete was dead.
</P>
<P>
   An apparent increase in such tragedies is touching off a debate
among public health officials. Should all US college students be
vaccinated against the strains of Neisseria meningitidis that cause
most cases of meningitis in this age group?
</P>
<P>
   Authors of a study published this week say yes. Others say more
evidence is needed to avoid unintended harm from widespread use of
a vaccine that may cause serious side-effects not seen so far in
its limited use.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that students at four-year colleges in Maryland
who live in on-campus housing had more than a three-fold higher
risk of bacterial meningitis than students who live off-campus.
College students who lived off-campus did not have a higher rate of
meningitis than 18- to 22-year-olds in general.
</P>
<P>
   The results confirm studies in military recruits showing that
close proximity increases the risk of meningococcal meningitis, a
rare but often devastating infection caused by an organism that
lives in the throats of many people without causing harm.
</P>
<P>
   The currently marketed vaccine would have prevented 80 percent
of the 228 Maryland meningitis cases among college students and
three of the four fatal cases seen there between 1992 and 1997, the
researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This disease is relatively uncommon,'' said Dr. Lee H.
Harrison of Johns Hopkins University and the University of
Pittsburgh, lead author of the study, which appears in this week's
Journal of the American Medical Association. ``Yet all you have to
do is see a couple of cases of young healthy people dying in a
short period of time to be convinced that _ if you've got a vaccine
that is safe, effective, and inexpensive _ it is reasonable to
immunize.''
</P>
<P>
   The study was paid for by Pasteur Merieux Connaught, which makes
a meningitis vaccine effective against four major strains of the
bacterium, along with the US Centers for Disease Control and the
state of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Other public health officials acknowledge growing concern about
bacterial meningitis, even though it is a relatively rare disease
that strikes about 2,600 people a year in this country, most of
them children under age 5. About 175 cases may occur annually among
US college students.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been anecdotal observations that a lot of college
students have been getting the disease in the last few years,''
said Dr. Bela Matyas of the Massachusetts Department of Public
Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``But from a public health standpoint, an anecdotal approach is
not appropriate,'' Matyas added. ``If we go ahead and decide that
some group of people en masse should be vaccinated, we have to
demonstrate that we will significantly reduce the disease without
causing a bigger problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Matyas noted that the meningitis vaccine ``has never been used
on a large scale, so we don't know if it's a somewhat safe vaccine
or a very safe vaccine.'' Vaccines have been known to cause
unexpected side effects when used on a mass basis, such as the
cases of paralysis called Guillain-Barre syndrome that cropped up
after the ill-advised swine flu vaccine campaign in the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The American College Health Association recommends that college
students consider meningitis vaccination, which costs about $50,
and that college health services ``take a proactive role in
providing information and access to the vaccine.''
</P>
<P>
   Matyas urged that a decision about mass vaccination await the
results next year of a national study by the CDC on meningitis
among teenagers and young adults.

WHY HIM AND NOT ME?
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Tuesday, June 1.)  
(Eds: There will be only one Susan Swartz column this week. There
will be no columns for the next two weeks.) (mk) 
 By SUSAN SWARTZ

<TEXT>
<P>
   We were talking about the difference between lust and envy over
lunch and a friend said that he no longer lusts for things but he
is envious and one thing he envies is celebrity. For example he no
longer has car lust or house lust but he does envy the famous their
access to interesting people.
</P>
<P>
   He assumes that celebrities get to surround themselves with
fascinating people of their own choosing, that if you're famous you
can ask Tom Waits and Madeleine Albright over for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we recognize there are drawbacks to high visibility.
You can't stop at the bagel shop all sweaty from the gym. Someone
is always watching. Look at poor Julia Roberts. She's in Newsweek
magazine, of all places, waving to a crowd in London and setting
off a scandal because she didn't shave under her arms.
</P>
<P>
   People notice those dumb things when you're famous.
</P>
<P>
   But there are times you think _ oh yes, you do _ why him/her and
not me?
</P>
<P>
   We assume the famous get invited to more parties, don't worry
about money, have good teeth and someone to work on their feet. If
they stay home with a video it's a film not yet released to us
commoners.
</P>
<P>
   My friend used to occasionally hang out with Annie Lamott, the
recently famous writer, back when she was a famous drinker. That
Lamott once drank is well known to her fans, and my friend, who
also writes and once drank, envies that she's made use of both to
become famous.
</P>
<P>
   He went to a reading for her latest book and happened to run
into her in the hall. He said ``hi.'' She said ``hi'' back and he
thought of reminding her that they used to know each other from a
certain saloon but decided not to. Not because he was too gracious
to bring up those wild years but because he would have been crushed
if she would have shook her head no, she couldn't place him.
</P>
<P>
   Most famous people come from ordinary beginnings and are going
to be remembered by people who were in their science club in high
school or drank with them one rainy Friday night in Cotati. Then
they become famous and someone thinks back and says, ``Hey, I knew
that guy.'' But it doesn't necessarily work the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   A woman I know used to go out with the famous writer John Irving
back when they were in college. She now teaches literature and
creative writing and she's not surprised that good old John became
a best-selling author.
</P>
<P>
   At age 20, when they were college juniors and ran around in the
same art and writing bunch, she says he already had an agent and
had been taken under the wing of two writing teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Recently when he was reading in San Francisco she considered
going and sending a note to him backstage, but she, too, worried
that he'd pull a blank when he looked at her.
</P>
<P>
   Being a major John Irving fan, I pressed her for all details,
romantic and otherwise. She said they went out off and on for five
months. He took her to wrestling matches and once to dinner at a
New York restaurant where there was violin music and he taught her
to drink bourbon. Another time he introduced her to Cointreau which
he'd learned to drink in Spain and he loved Spain.
</P>
<P>
   She's been following his career ever since ``The World According
to Garp.'' She liked that Jenny Garp, the mother heroine, is a
nurse because she remembered that John's mother was a nurse.
</P>
<P>
   She's also followed his personal life and notes that he seems
happily married to his current wife, a Canadian woman who used to
be his publicist. Once she ran into a mutual friend who told her
Irving had become ``an incredible womanizer.'' She says, ``I may be
the only woman who didn't sleep with him.''
</P>
<P>
   She said ``he was worldly, he had confidence and he was
focused,'' so his success makes sense. But she also says had he not
become John Irving the famous writer she might not have remembered
him as anyone more than ``another guy I dated.''
</P>
<P>
   What she envies about his life is ``having enough money to just
write, travel wherever you want, live wherever you want and to be
able to say, `I think I'll do a piece for the New Yorker.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But what do we know? Maybe the famous yearn to be invisible,
snapped at by clerks, ignored by waiters, bugged on the phone by
people wanting to give them better long distance rates.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they're like Michelle Pfeiffer who says she likes her life
but wishes she had long legs and curly hair.
</P>
<P>
   Who wants to have to worry about things like that?

DUPING OF LENO ONE FOR BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - NBC's Web site for the ``Tonight Show'' includes a
teaser for the popular headlines feature in which Jay Leno shows
funny mistakes in newspapers all around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``These headlines are real,'' the teaser reads. ``Really.''
</P>
<P>
   Not really. Not this time. It seems a Valley man is having the
last laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the headline in question really ran. It just wasn't a
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's not exactly right either. It (begin ital) was (end
ital) a mistake, but it was a mistake made on purpose, which isn't
a mistake at all.
</P>
<P>
   It's deceit. But, first, an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   For the last year or so, Mark Walters, who owns Mr. Books in
northwest Phoenix, has had this scheme.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came up with the idea to create my own display ad that had a
problem,'' Walters said, sitting behind the counter of Mr. Books.
``Our original intent was to get some exposure, a free ad _ to get
some publicity.''
</P>
<P>
   He would have the ad printed, he figured, cut it out and send it
in. Then the ``Tonight Show'' staff would see it, like it, Leno
would show it, and Mr. Books would receive a dose of national
exposure. Exposure for an erroneous ad, yes, but exposure
nonetheless. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Not just happy accident &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right. First of all, what are the chances the staff would
pick the ad? And if someone liked it and passed it along, there
must be a waiting list of, what, 20 years or something? By the time
the ad appeared, would Walters still be alive?
</P>
<P>
   Yes. The whole thing took about two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Walters paid $200 for an ad in the ``Custom Shopper,'' a free
publication. That's where, in the latest issue, you'll find it:
</P>
<P>
   ``Be smart, reed a book.''
</P>
<P>
   Look closely, and you'll see that the important words are what
stand out _ ``Phoenix,'' ``Mr. Books,'' that kind of thing.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't just a happy accident. Walters studied the headlines
shown on the ``Tonight Show'' with two goals in mind. One was to
make the mistake bad enough that it would be noticed. The other was
to play up those key words so that they would show up on camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``I devised it specifically to (see) what would it look like
when the ``Tonight Show'' cameraman zoomed in on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Walters tapes up signs with goofy sayings in the windows of Mr.
Books _ one played off John and Lorena Bobbitt's marital
misadventures. ``Bobbitt sale _ sausage cookbooks half-off,'' it
read.
</P>
<P>
   He took the ``reed a book'' idea from one such sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The original was `Be smart like us _ reed a book,' '' he said.
``I had that, but I thought, `This looks too much like something
someone's trying to do.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Can't have that. So he dropped the ``like us'' and proceeded. &QL; 
 &QL; 
`Brave little bookstore' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the matter of submitting the erroneous ad.
Walters couldn't very well own up to being its author. So he
didn't. He used his mother's address and played the part of an
impartial third party. He didn't save a copy of the letter but
remembered writing that this mistake was particularly funny,
``knowing how proper bookstores think they are.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I sent it in and started taping (the show) every night,'' he
said. On May 17, the ad ran.
</P>
<P>
   He has heard from customers who saw the spot, he said, but not
from NBC. Told about the deception, Jennifer Barnett, an NBC
spokeswoman, said, ``We get about 8,000 to 10,000 headlines a week.
We go through every one of them, and we definitely get a lot that
are fake. That's not to say that sometimes one wouldn't slip
through that is a fake.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently.
</P>
<P>
   I've always been a Letterman man myself, so someone duping Leno
doesn't bother me much. Still, doesn't Walters feel a little bad?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all,'' he said. ``This is America. All you want to do
is let people know your brave little bookstore is here for people
to enjoy. I just saw it as an opportunity for the little guy to do
something a little larger than life, almost.''
</P>
<P>
   Pardon me if I don't weep. &QL;

WHITE HOUSE ADMITS SECURITY BREACHES IN RESPONSE TO COX REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House responded in a low-key and
respectful manner on Tuesday to the release of the Cox committee
report on Chinese nuclear espionage, acknowledging that a serious
security breach exists while assuring Congress and the public that
the administration is hard at work fixing it.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said that he shared the concerns of the
panel's nine members and offered assurances that the administration
was working to adopt many of its recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, let me say that I am particularly appreciative of the
careful and bipartisan manner in which the committee did its
work,'' said the president, speaking at an unrelated domestic
policy event in Texas. ``Like many other countries, China seeks to
acquire our sensitive information and technology. We have a solemn
obligation to protect such national security information, and we
have to do more to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The accommodating tone of the White House reaction arises from
the gravity of the charges in the Cox committee report released on
Tuesday and signed unanimously by the panel's Republicans and
Democrats. The president's aides, who have known of the panel's
major conclusions for several months, concluded that a harsh
response would not give sufficient weight to the seriousness of the
allegations and could be politically damaging.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks to reporters and in a written response to the Cox
committee findings, administration officials stressed that many of
the suspected losses of sensitive technology took place before
Clinton entered office. They also repeated earlier assertions that
Clinton and his top advisers took swift and decisive action when
they learned of the alleged security breaches.
</P>
<P>
   The White House's written response noted that security at the
national weapons laboratories, where the most serious leakage is
suspected to have occurred, ``has been a long-term concern,
stretching back more than two decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Richardson, the secretary of energy, which overseas the
weapons labs, said at a news conference on Tuesday that the Clinton
administration deserved credit for responding promptly to
accusations of espionage.
</P>
<P>
   ``This administration has acted on the problem; previous
administrations didn't act,'' Richardson said. ``Now, this is not a
partisan issue; this is a bipartisan problem that we are trying to
fix.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson called the Cox report ``an important, valuable piece
of work,'' yet noted that he had begun moving aggressively to
improve security and counter-espionage surveillance at the national
weapons labs long before the Cox report was released.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have undertaken a total overhaul of the Department of
Energy Counterintelligence Program,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do take issue with one component of the Cox report,'' he
added, ``and that is, that we have taken enormously aggressive
action to deal with the problem. We are fixing the problem. I can
assure the American people that their nuclear secrets are now safe
at the labs.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration response, fashioned over weeks of
consultations among officials of the National Security Council, the
White House counsel's office, Cabinet officers and the president's
top political advisers, is in marked contrast to its handling of
myriad other investigations launched by the Republican-led
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has responded to prior inquiries with delay,
denial and legalisms. The president's defenders have tarred the
investigations as partisan and accused Republicans of dredging up
trivia to embarrass the president.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, however, the White House has sounded a more
conciliatory note, in part because the nine-member Cox committee's
four Democrats all endorsed its findings.
</P>
<P>
   The administration also does not want to turn relations between
the United States and China into a political circus that could set
back the president's policy of ``strategic partnership'' with
Beijing for years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he will not allow China's alleged theft of American
military secrets to derail his policy of economic and diplomatic
engagement with Beijing because it is in the United States'
interest. He said the United States had in place strict controls to
limit transfer of sensitive technology to China, a statement at
odds with many of the conclusions of the investigative committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I strongly believe that our continuing engagement with China
has produced benefits for our national security,'' the president
said.
</P>
<P>
   A White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity,
said that the allegations of Chinese nuclear spying were of a
different nature from last year's impeachment charges and earlier
investigations into Whitewater and other matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a recognition that we are dealing with serious
issues,'' the official said, ``but we view them as issues that are
longstanding ones and that require steps to deal with, and we're
taking them.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of mounting a hostile defense, the White House is
pleading for understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think it's valuable for anyone to point fingers in a
way that detracts from work that should be done,'' the official
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the White House did not completely abandon the field to Cox
and his conclusions. Included with the White House's written
response was a sheaf of newspaper articles and opinion pieces that
set out to debunk the committee's findings and The New York Times'
reporting on them.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are two columns by Lars Erik Nelson of the New York
Daily News, who accused the Times of conducting a ``lynching'' of
Wen Ho Lee, the former Los Alamos laboratory worker suspected of
nuclear espionage. Nelson also wrote that Clinton has gotten a
``bum rap'' over alleged theft of nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The clippings also include reports from the Washington Post and
Los Angeles Times, based on interviews with administration
officials and outside intelligence specialists, that call into
question the severity of the technical losses. Other clippings
include columns defending the administration's policy of strategic
partnership with China, including one by Henry Kissinger, the
architect of American engagement with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, seeking to tamp down the passions that debates on China
always inspire, said Tuesday that he wanted to address the problem
of possible theft of nuclear secrets without damaging relations
with the most populous nation on earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to assure you and all the American people that I will
work very hard with the Congress to protect our national
security,'' he said in Texas, ``to implement the recommendations
and to continue our policy of engagement because both of them are
in the national interest.''

GERMANY CONTINUES TO PUSH FOR DIPLOMATIC SOLUTION IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said here
on Tuesday that Germany was counting on a diplomatic outcome to the
war in Kosovo, with the backing of Russia, in the next several
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing strong statements by the German chancellor, Gerhard
Schroder, Fischer stressed that Germany opposed NATO forces
entering Kosovo unless a settlement was first reached with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Germany supported a NATO plan approved on Tuesday to enlarge a
security force outside Kosovo to about 50,000. But Germany insisted
that the force be deployed to escort ethnic Albanian refugees back
to their homes in the wake of a political settlement, not as any
kind of invasion force, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer, the second NATO foreign minister in less than a week
who felt the need to personally explain his point of view to the
State Department, put great stock in having a solution ready by
June 18, when the Group of 7 industrialized nations and Russia hold
a summit in Cologne, Germany. President Clinton and the Russian
president, Boris Yeltsin, will meet along with other leaders.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, Fischer said, Germany would like to have a
Security Council resolution that would endorse the expanded
security force that NATO approved on Tuesday at a meeting of its 19
ambassadors in Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a very decisive situation of the conflict because
within the next two weeks, we will see whether we get a political
solution or not,'' Fischer told reporters at a breakfast meeting at
the Germany embassy. ``In the next two weeks, we will know whether
we are successful at the Security Council.''
</P>
<P>
   But to achieve this rapid timetable, Fischer acknowledged,
Russia would have to agree to the NATO force without the
acquiescence of Milosevic, a scenario that Clinton administration
officials believe to be desirable, but a long shot.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer cited constitutional and political reasons for Germany's
opposition to the use of an invading ground force. It would not be
possible to get the parliamentary vote necessary to overcome the
constitutional barriers to ground forces, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the Christian Democrats, the party of former Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, has accused the current ``Red-Green'' coalition of
being too pro-NATO. The party has said it would oppose a ground
war.
</P>
<P>
   Public support for the war in Germany has declined, according to
one recent poll, to 51 percent from 61 percent last month.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, French public opinion has remained solidly behind
the air strikes, with about 70 percent support. Opinion polls in
France show that about 60 percent of the public support the use of
combat troops, if NATO deems them necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The tone of Fischer's remarks Tuesday morning, and later as he
stood beside Secretary of State Madeleine Albright before a State
Department lunch, were in contrast to those of Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook of Britain, who came here last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Cook said the NATO security force had to be prepared to go into
Kosovo without a formal agreement with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The Greek foreign minister, George Papandreou, whose government
faces almost total opposition to the NATO air strikes from the
Greek public, is due here this week, as well.
</P>
<P>
   If a diplomatic solution envisioned along the lines he outlined
failed to materialize, this would be a ``new situation'' requiring
more discussion within NATO and requiring ``a new decision,''
Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
   Strobe Talbott, the deputy secretary of state, arrived in Moscow
on Tuesday for a resumption of talks with the Russian envoy to the
Balkans, Viktor Chernomyrdin. But the outlook for closing the wide
gaps between the NATO position and that of Moscow on a Kosovo
agreement did not appear promising.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said there was little cohesion
in the Russian government on the Kosovo question. Chernomyrdin, an
appointee of Yeltsin, was essentially opposed by the new
government, including the Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
   Russian public opinion and sentiment in the Duma is strongly
pro-Serbian and anti-NATO. Further inflaming the situation is the
fact that an expanded NATO _ an expansion that Russia opposed _ is
bombing a fellow Slav nation.
</P>
<P>
   Russia continues to demand that NATO stop the bombing before
Milosevic is required to pull out any troops from Kosovo, the
obverse position to one of NATO's five demands on how to end the
war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, it is premature to speak of any progress,'' in
the talks on Kosovo, Ivanov said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott, who spent days in Moscow last week, will be
concentrating on the composition of the security force, which NATO
insists must be an operation with NATO command and control.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians are insisting that the force must have a higher
concentration of troops under U.N. control rather than NATO
control, officials said. So far, Milosevic has said he would only
accept a U.N. presence composed of men with side arms.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer, however, suggested that the Russians might decide to
ditch Milosevic and side with the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a possibility where the Russians say to
Milosevic: `We can't help you anymore,''' he said. The Russians, he
said, did not have a lasting interest in having their relationship
with the West sidelined by the Kosovo war.

COHEN POSTPONES TRIP TO CHINA
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Secretary of Defense William Cohen has postponed a
planned trip to China, citing tension between Washington and
Beijing, the Pentagon announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   On the day Congress released its report on the theft of American
nuclear secrets by the Chinese, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon
said Cohen believed that this was ``not the easiest time to visit
China.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He did have tentative plans to go in June,'' Bacon said. ``He
feels that it may be better to go later. He remains, of course,
steadfastly committed to engagement with China as a long-term
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   China temporarily broke off all military-to-military programs
with the United States after the accidental bombing by NATO of the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade on May 7. At the time, NATO and the
United States apologized to China for the bombing, which killed
three Chinese journalists and wounded 20 other Chinese officials.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a week, Chinese citizens held anti-NATO and
anti-American protests in Beijing and other Chinese cities,
encouraged in part by the government, which has been opposed to the
NATO air campaign since it began in March.
</P>
<P>
   NATO supreme commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, delivered his report
Tuesday on the bombing accident, saying it had been caused by
faulty maps prepared by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere between China and the United States has been
clouded, as well, by the release Tuesday of the report by a select
committee of Congress that says China used documents and blueprints
it stole from the United States to develop and improve its nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said the Cox Committee report did not suggest that China
took advantage of the military-to-military exchanges in its attempt
to steal secrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``These exchanges were, although important, not the type of
exchanges that allowed any classified information to be transmitted
one way or another,'' he said. ``We were really trying to get to
know the Chinese military a little better and allow them to get to
know our military a little better so we could avoid
misunderstandings today and in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   China will consider whether to resume those exchanges next
month, according to a Pentagon official. The official said the
lines of communication between the two militaries remained open.
</P>
<P>
   The military contacts include exchanges of high-level visits by
the secretaries of defense and heads of services, ship visits at
ports in the United States and China, exchanges of information on
safety in naval and air operations to avoid incidents at sea,
exchanges of observers at joint training exercises, and sharing of
information on disaster relief.
</P>
<P>
   The United States temporarily broke off the program in May 1996
in protest Chinese missile tests near Taiwan when that country was
holding its presidential elections.

MLK DAY OBSERVANCE   BILL PASSES IN NEW HAMPSHIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RALPH JIMENEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ Next year, New Hampshire will at last join the
rest of the nation in honoring the birthday of civil rights leader
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, by a surprisingly strong vote of 212 to 148, New
Hampshire lawmakers passed King Day legislation that has Governor
Jeanne Shaheen's fervent support. The bill will come before the
24-member Senate on Thursday, which is expected to pass it. Shaheen
could sign it into law early next week.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1979 when the first King holiday bill was introduced, the
conservative, 400-member House has rejected moves to honor King 11
times. Since 1993, when Arizona joined the national fold, New
Hampshire has stood alone in refusing to attach King's name to a
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to congratulate the House and all of the people who
worked so hard to get this legislation passed, not just today but
for the last 20 years,'' Shaheen said in a statement issued after a
vote that many hope will help the state shed a reputation of racial
intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, at the height of the US presidential campaign, white
supremacists held a rally on the State House steps to celebrate New
Hampshire's intransigence regarding King, who was assassinated in
1968. Last month, the Ku Klux Klan chose the little town of
Washington for a midnight leaflet campaign extolling white
separatism.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, despite a trip to New Hampshire by King's widow,
Coretta Scott King, protests by school children, and appeals from
the state's civil rights leaders, clergy and governor, King Day
legislation failed in the House by just one vote.
</P>
<P>
   Many speakers in the 90 minutes of floor debate that preceded
Tuesday's vote warned that New Hampshire should not set itself
apart by rejecting the bill again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martin Luther King said that one day he hoped that his
children would be judged not by the color of their skin but by the
content of their character,'' Representative Jane Kelley, a Hampton
Democrat told her colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, New Hampshire must be judged by the content of its
character. We must pass this legislation before us so that the ugly
stain of racism and bigotry can be cleansed from the beautiful face
of New Hampshire,'' Kelley said.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights activists across the country Tuesday praised the
news, describing it as an important step for the entire country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another step toward healing, and it's welcome,'' said the
Rev. Jesse Jackson, who marched with King throughout the South in
the 1960s. ``Our better angels in New Hampshire have prevailed.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said that for too long the state treated the holiday as
a political football rather than a moral imperative. ``They are
trying to make up for lost time,'' he said. ``But in the end, faith
and hope have prevailed.''
</P>
<P>
   The historic vote comes 25 years after Massachusetts made King's
birthday a state holiday and 16 years after a federal law gave
states the option of joining in the national celebration of King
and his message of equality and non-violence.
</P>
<P>
   Despite victory, as the House vote indicates, resistance to
honoring King remains strong in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Several speakers argued that King did not deserve an honor
denied US presidents George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. Others
faulted King for reports of infidelity and his opposition to the
Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should honor someone with the following characteristics,''
said Representative Ralph Rosen, a retired Naval officer from
Laconia. ``That person should be preeminent in the actual
achievement of civil rights. That person should be of unquestioned
moral stature and . . . that person should be completely dedicated
to our country and all of the people in it,'' Rosen argued.
</P>
<P>
   After 20 years of often acrimonious debate, the arguments for or
against a King holiday were familar to both sides. No catcalls or
boos marred the proceeding, but some speakers, among them
Representatives John Pratt and Harvey Keye, moved their colleagues
to applause _ and at times, to tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been more than 40 years since I joined thousands of my
countrymen in that long march through Atlanta,'' said Pratt, then
one of the young, white civil rights activists who marched in
King's funeral procession. Atlanta's City Hall flew its flags at
half-staff and its portico was draped in black crepe. On the other
side of the street, Georgia's flags, including the battle flag of
the Confederacy, flew at full-staff above the State House while
state troopers taunted the marchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope my colleagues today will vote in this chamber to dispel
any doubt about on which side of the street this venerable building
and the people we represent stand,'' the Walpole businessman said.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Harvey Keye of Nashua is one of three blacks
serving as a legislator in a state where African-Americans make up
less than 1 percent of the population. ``I ran in an all-white ward
and won by seven votes so I can't say it's a racist place,'' Keye
said. ``Racism comes out when there is a threat and there aren't
enough of us to provide a threat,'' Keye said after Tuesday's vote.
</P>
<P>
   In his floor speech, Keye spoke of his boyhood in Birmingham,
Ala., in the days of Governor George Wallace and police
commissioner Eugene ``Bull'' Connor. ``As a little boy, I could not
walk the streets and look white people in the eye because that was
a threat to white people and I could be arrested for disorderly
conduct,'' Keye told his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   A stint as a gang leader sent Keye first to the courts, then to
Catholic School, and finally to college. He was working as a waiter
at a country club on a night King and his fellow Southern Christian
Leadership Council leaders were having a conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shortly afterward, a big bomb blew a hole in the wall and it
seemed like it had been contrived by the police because about 10
minutes later they were having a press conference with King,'' Keye
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Young, tough, and still hotheaded, Keye said he and his friends
decided to find the bombers and kill them. King talked them out of
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martin Luther King talked to us. He talked of Mahatma Ghandi
and his philosophy of non-violence. I stayed until the wee hours of
the morning and talked not only to Martin Luther King but to the
others, and at that time, I put down my arms and became a warrior
and an ambassador for God,'' Keye said in a speech followed by a
long silence before the applause.
</P>
<P>
   Most King holiday supporters, among them Mel Bolden, a former
state representative and member of the state's human rights
commission, cited not racism, but orneriness for New Hampshire's
solitary stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just them being contrary Yankees,'' said Bolden, an
octogenarian artist, who is black and who has made his home in the
state since the 1960s. Shaheen's support, Bolden said, helped
overcome that legendary stubborness.
</P>
<P>
   Though past governors have backed the holiday, Shaheen ``was the
only one who really came down front for it,'' Bolden said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it has to do with habituation and resistance to
people trying to tell us what to do,'' said Steve Davis, a black
school administrator who helped organize the first schoolchildrens'
march on the State House in support of the holiday a decade ago.
``This is the `Live Free or Die' state. `We are who we are and you
are not going to tell us what to do,' and you have to respect
that.''

   KOSOVO-ALBANIA (Tirana) _ The transformation from Communist
outpost to a member of the European community of nations has not
been easy. Albania remains Europe's poorest country and has
suffered through one crisis after another. With its economy

TWO NETWORKS CURTAIL VIOLENT PROGRAMMING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (e and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It may not last, but at least for the moment the television
industry appears to have been jolted into a heightened sense of
social responsibility by the massacre one month ago at Columbine
High School in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   The WB network decided this week to delay airing the season
finale of ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' because it depicted a high
school graduation that explodes into a violent confrontation. CBS,
which had earlier shelved an episode of ``Promised Land'' involving
a shooting in front of a Denver school, took the extra step last
week yanking a much-touted but bloody new drama called ``Falcone''
off its fall schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``We screened the pilot about a week after Littleton happened,''
CBS Television president Leslie Moonves said Tuesday. ``There were
killings on the boardwalk of New York. We all cringed. At that
moment, it became a noncontender.''
</P>
<P>
   Moonves said Hollywood is buzzing with ``a lot more discussion
than ever before'' about violence. ``It's a question of being
responsible programmers, responsible citizens,'' he added. ``I'm a
big First Amendment guy, and it's very easy to hang your hat on
that, but there's a problem out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Call it the Columbine context: In the wake of the April 20
shootings that left 15 dead and staggered the nation, TV executives
are looking much more closely at the violent content of shows they
put on the air.
</P>
<P>
   Having done its part to saturate the culture with violent
images, television is now on the defensive, as some say the medium
_ along with movies and video games _ should shoulder some of the
blame for episodes of real-life violence. Others suggest network
programmers are overreacting. Pointing to the prevalence of guns
and the weakening of the family structure, they argue that the
entertainment industry is taking the fall for a broader societal
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's looking for a scapegoat after Columbine, and
everybody's looking for an answer,'' said Steve Grubbs, a top
executive at BBDO Inc., a New York agency that buys TV time for
advertisers. ``But there is no one single thing to blame here.
There is no one easy answer available.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it appears that whereas once TV executives might
have rejected criticism of excessive violence in their programs,
they now are listening closely and factoring it into their
decisions _ at least for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should we be mindful of it? Absolutely,'' Jamie Tarses,
president of ABC Entertainment, said Tuesday. ``Everyone, with good
reason, is overly sensitive to it right now.''
</P>
<P>
   As they make decisions on how much violence is too much,
programmers are again feeling the heat from Washington. A bill was
recently introduced in Congress to ban TV violence completely;
though it failed to pass, it signaled renewed congressional concern
about an issue that has often pitted Capitol Hill against
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, President Clinton has used his bully pulpit to
cajole the entertainment industry into handling violence more
responsibly. In a recent radio address, Clinton said that ``too
many vulnerable children . . . are steeped in this culture of
violence'' that makes them more likely to commit crimes, while
``too many creators and purveyors of violence say there is nothing
they can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent poll by the National Institute on Media and the Family,
conducted before the Columbine High shootings, found that parents
were more worried about the violence their children see on
television than about sexual content of the shows.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond political and public pressure, another possible factor
motivating network executives is that they are anticipating
pressure from advertisers who don't want their products associated
with violent fare in the wake of the recent school shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Broadcasters can put two and two together and figure, why give
themselves a headache,'' said Leanne Jenkins, senior vice president
at Hill Holliday Connors Cosmopulos, the second largest ad agency
in New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advertisers are always concerned about the environment they're
putting their message in. Network programmers know they're going to
sell the advertising easier if there's less violence,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Jenkins added, many advertisers will still consider a
show's viewership ratings a more important factor than the amount
of violence when choosing which programs to advertise on.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there are questions about how lasting the TV
industry's current qualms about violence will be. While Moonves
said it is not appropriate now to air ``Falcone,'' he has not ruled
out a spot for it on CBS's midseason schedule in January. As for
the violent graduation episode of ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' the
WB's decision was to delay airing it, not scrap it entirely. The
Fox network has scheduled a program for this fall called ``Harsh
Realm'' that The New York Times said includes ``as heavy a quotient
of violence as any show ever made, though Fox executives have
promised the series will tone the violence down.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, though, the Columbine High massacre seems to have
network executives thinking harder about the possible consequences
of violent imagery, especially among young people.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Kellner, chief executive of the WB, said in yanking the
``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' episode that his decision was ``borne
out of a deep sense of responsibility to the WB's loyal young
audience.'' Previously, the WB had also pulled a ``Buffy'' episode
involving a student who was planning a mass murder at the high
school.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with TV critics Tuesday, CBS's Moonves said
the current efforts to cut down on violence are similar to the
television industry's agreement to go along with the V-chip and to
affix content ratings on programs (both of which occurred amid
congressional pressure).
</P>
<P>
   Antiviolence efforts are ``something we should work very
proactively toward, as opposed to being defensive,'' Moonves said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always try to be responsible when it comes to violence,''
he added. ``There is no question the world has become more
heightened to what has happened recently.''
</P>
<P>
   Tarses, of ABC, predicted that fallout from the Colorado
shootings will influence the topics of numerous dramas on the fall
TV schedule. ``I'm sure some of our dramas will be addressing it in
the future season,'' she said. ``There's obviously a lot to say on
this subject.''
</P>
<P>
   Though she did not link it to the Columbine High shootings,
Tarses said a new program by David Lynch, the writer-producer
behind oft-violent fare like the movie ``Blue Velvet'' and the TV
series ``Twin Peaks,'' will not be on ABC's fall schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in a move that some speculate could be linked to the
climate of concern after Columbine, even the syndicated ``Jerry
Springer Show,'' known for fistfights and general mayhem, has
lately toned down its content.

BLUE CROSS MEMBERS TO ACCESS TO SECOND OPINION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- In an effort to cultivate a more patient-friendly
persona, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts said Tuesday
it will let its 1.6 million members turn to an outside organization
to appeal denials of coverage by the health insurer.
</P>
<P>
   While more than 20 states currently require health maintenance
organizations to let members get a second opinion from an
independent third party, Massachusetts does not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly it was what our customers were clamoring for,'' said
William Van Faasen, chief executive of Blue Cross. ``As health
plans look more and more alike, it's customer satisfaction that
will differentiate us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Cross move was well-received by patient advocates and
state lawmakers who say it constituted a good, if incomplete, step
toward achieving a package of patients rights that is currently
under review in the State House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an excellent step forward,'' said Representative
Harriette Chandler, a Democrat from Worcester and co-chairwoman of
the legislative joint health care committee.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Derby of Health Care For All, a patient advocate group
in Boston, also lauded Blue Cross, but said the health plan did not
go far enough. For one thing, the Blue Cross plan allows members to
appeal only care in which the patient and Blue Cross disagree over
whether it's ``medically necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good concept, and we commend them for trying,'' said
Derby, ``but if they get to set the rules by which patients can
appeal, that's inadequate protection for patients.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Cross proposal lets patients appeal coverage denials to
physicians contracted by Vital Solutions Inc., a subsidiary of
MassPRO, a company that provides managed care services to the state
Division of Medical Assistance and private health plans throughout
Massachusetts, including Blue Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Members can turn to Vital Solutions only after they exhaust Blue
Cross' internal appeals process, which takes five days on average,
according to Ron Romano, Blue Cross' consumer ombudsman. Complaints
lodged at Vital Solutions would be resolved within 10 days.
Emergency appeals would be resolved within two days.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the review _ $300 a case _ would be shared, with
Blue Cross paying $200 and the member paying $100. Blue Cross said
it would pay the full amount for ``hardship cases,'' which would be
determined on a case-by-case basis, Romano said.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross processes about 150 appeals a month, the vast
majority of which are resolved in the members' favor. Only about 20
percent of those cases remain denied, Romano said.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, the state's biggest HMO, said it
has for the past 10 years allowed patients whose care had been
denied coverage to turn to outside arbitration. Of the 2,600
appeals filed at Harvard Pilgrim last year, only two have reached
arbitration. The vast majority of appeals are settled before
arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Tufts Health Plan, the state's second-largest HMO,
Tuesday said they were ``actively considering an external appeals
process.'' Sources say Tufts is close to adopting a program similar
to Blue Cross'.

WEATHER DELAYS RIGHT WHALE RESCUE ATTEMPT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Rough seas prevented a specially trained animal rescue team from
disentangling a rare Northern right whale snarled in fishing gear
90 miles off Cape Cod Tuesday, and rescue officials said
Wednesday's weather doesn't look promising either.
</P>
<P>
   The whale, one of only about 300 right whales left in the world,
has three buoys floating near its head and fishing line wrapped
around its body and trailing behind. Although the animal appears to
be swimming normally, officials at the Center for Coastal Studies
fear the gear will interfere with the animal's feeding, possibly
killing it.
</P>
<P>
   But, unlike most whales the center has disentangled, this one is
far outside the more protected waters of Cape Cod Bay, and rescuers
must watch out for towering waves that can swamp the hard-bottomed
inflatable boat they use in rescues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whale is traveling through some very rough seas with up to
12-foot swells. . . . Beyond 6 feet, we can't get close to the
whale,'' said Scott Landry, spokesman for the Provincetown-based
center. ``It looks like Thursday is going to be our best weather
day.''
</P>
<P>
   The crew, led by biologist Charles ``Stormy'' Mayo, plans to
employ an old-fashioned whaling technique called ``kegging,'' in
which large buoys are attached to the whale to slow the animal and
prevent it from diving.
</P>
<P>
   Once the animal tires, the team will attempt to cut the lines
from the whale using knives on long poles equipped with
adjustable-length handles. Landry said the rescuers try never to
actually touch the whales, which can weigh up to 40 tons and kill
with the flick of a tail.
</P>
<P>
   Landry said rescuers expect a complicated effort with this
particular whale because the 45-foot animal appears strong and
because they have to work around its mouth. ``Judging from how the
animal is entangled, this would likely be more than a one-day
event,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Landry said the team does have experience on its side, since
so many whales get caught in fishing gear off the New England
coast. Last summer, they disentangled one right whale in Cape Cod
Bay three times.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the third time, he was quite amenable to it. He just opened
his mouth'' and rescuers removed the rope, Landry said.

CELLUCCI BACKTRACKS ON GEORGES BANK EXPLORATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Gov. Paul Cellucci beat a hasty retreat from his
tentative endorsement of oil and gas exploration in the fishing
ground of Georges Bank Tuesday, sending word out through aides that
he had not intended to reverse the state's longstanding opposition
while on a trade mission to Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci created a furor among fishermen, environmentalists and
fellow politicians last week when he told reporters in Nova Scotia
that he would consider supporting oil and gas exploration on the
Canadian side of the bank, one of the world's great fishing areas.
The US government has closed its side of the bank to the oil and
gas industry until 2012.
</P>
<P>
   But Environmental Affairs Secretary Bob Durand said that
Cellucci apparently misunderstood the issue in his interview at the
Halifax Herald. Fresh from a tour of a new natural gas plant in a
less fragile area, Cellucci let his enthusiasm for the Sable Island
project carry over to Georges Bank, he explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the public policy realm, there's plenty of room for
misunderstanding, and sometimes that occurs, and you've got to be
willing to say that's what happened here,'' said Durand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor was very excited about Sable Island and extension
of the gas pipeline,'' he said, referring to a pipeline that soon
may bring gas to Massachusetts. ``It would be easy for somebody to
see how you could misconstrue the distinction'' between Sable
Island and the explosive issue of oil drilling in Georges Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci's pirouette overshadowed efforts by US Rep. William
Delahunt, a Quincy Democrat, to extend Canada's moratorium on oil
and gas drilling on Georges Bank. In Quebec last weekend, Delahunt
won unanimous support from a group of Canadian members of
Parliament for extending the moratorium until 2012.
</P>
<P>
   In part because Cellucci's remarks were so at odds with other
Massachusetts politicians, as well as the state's position, many
observers assumed he had made a mistake when he said there could be
``middle ground'' to allow oil and gas exploration on the bank. But
Cellucci aides initially defended the position, suggesting the
Georges Bank oil and gas could reduce energy costs in New England.
</P>
<P>
   However, the uproar from activists and Massachusetts members of
Congress who oppose oil and gas exploration forced Cellucci to
clarify his views.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not changing public policy . . . He is urging the
Canadian government to extend the moratorium'' on oil and gas
exploration until 2012, Durand said.

CHINA TROUBLE: OUT IN THE OPEN AND IN OUR FACES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It has been building, quietly, subtly, for months,
even years, but after Tuesday's congressional report on Chinese
weapons espionage, the conclusion is unavoidable: The United States
is in a full-blown foreign-policy crisis with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The report detailing successful Chinese efforts to steal
nuclear-weapons secrets from US laboratories is an implicit
acknowledgement of the difficult relationship state of ties with
China. But it is more than that. Its release also contributes to
the air of crisis that surrounds an increasingly critical
relationship with a nation emerging, just a decade after the
collapse of the Soviet communist bloc, as America's newest
big-power rival.
</P>
<P>
   The stunning findings that China stole classified information on
every currently deployed thermonuclear warhead in the American
intercontinental ballistic missile arsenal prompted angry denials
from China. But the findings also deepened Beijing's suspicions
about Washington even as the American political establishment
adjusts to the uncomfortable notion that an era it thought over _
when world affairs were governed by great power struggles _ may be
back again.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the House committee that concluded China now possesses
stolen classified information on all of the United States' most
advanced thermonuclear weapons, along with many of the rockets
required to launch them, was one of the most devoutly bipartisan
panels on Capitol Hill. The Republicans and Democrats submitted
their findings with the extra punch of a unanimous vote.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about US relations with China now have spilled over
from the rarefied air of diplomacy into important trade and gritty
domestic political areas.
</P>
<P>
   These frictions affect access to each nation's economic markets.
They endanger China's membership in international trade
organizations. They shape relations between the parties on Capitol
Hill. They sharpen tensions between the Republican Party's
internationalist and isolationist factions.
</P>
<P>
   They also provide ammunition about human rights for both
religious conservatives and traditional liberals. And they could
affect the contours of the next presidential election, especially
the fortunes of Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   During the 44-year tug of the Cold War between Soviet communism
and Western capitalism _ from World War II until the fall of the
Berlin Wall _ the tensions in domestic policy and foreign policy
became inextricably interwoven. The result was a red scare that
imperiled American civil liberties, an arms race that warped the
economies of both the United States and the Soviet Union and a
climate of tension that chilled domestic politics.
</P>
<P>
   Already there are troubling signs that American domestic and
diplomatic interests are again converging, all the while
heightening rather than dampening tensions with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign policy findings in the 700-page report are matched
by domestic-policy worries that China simultaneously sought to
influence the last American presidential election. As China has
sought to bolster its presence in global affairs and to increase
its military firepower, it also has roiled American domestic
affairs by its effort to win trade concessions from the United
States that have incendiary political implications here.
</P>
<P>
   Just Tuesday, the House marked the approaching 10th anniversary
of China's Tiananmen Square crackdown with a 418-0 vote condemning
``ongoing and egregious'' human rights abuses by the Beijing
government. Only last month, American combat jets mistakenly bombed
the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, prompting anti-US riots in the
streets of the Chinese capital and transforming the tensions
between the two nations into a domestic controversy in China as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Though the findings of the committee provided clear evidence
that the security breaches spanned three decades and four
presidencies, the report provided yet another challenge to the
Clinton administration, which has argued for a policy of engagement
with China in the face of skepticism from both the left and right.
That challenge took the form of criticism from leading Republicans
who Tuesday demanded the resignations of Attorney General Janet
Reno, who rejected FBI requests to wiretap one of the prime
suspects in the spy case, and National Security Adviser Samuel R.
``Sandy'' Berger, who has been under fire for failing to act when
he first learned of the allegations in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there were mounting signs Tuesday that the China
espionage scandal could provide a new hurdle for Gore, who is
seeking to succeed President Clinton in next year's election.
Former Red Cross president Elizabeth H. Dole, a potential GOP
candidate, spoke of the ``failure of the Clinton-Gore
administration to deal with'' security lapses at national nuclear
laboratories, while publisher Steve Forbes attacked what he called
``the Clinton-Gore administration's national-security policy of
hear no evil, see no evil and speak no evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Governor George W. Bush, another Republican contender,
said the report ``shines a glaring light on the current
administration's failed policies toward China.'' His father was
vice president and then president during 12 of the years in which
the spying supposedly occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosures about the theft of nuclear weapons secrets are
shocking in their own right. Indeed, they prompt comparisons with
Soviet espionage into the development of the hydrogen bomb at
midcentury, when American scientists were forced to conclude that
in developing the H-bomb for the United States, they also were
developing the weapon for our superpower rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's report found that the stolen US nuclear secrets give
China design information on thermonuclear weapons ``on a par with
our own,'' a conclusion that suggests Americans now or in the
future may be at risk of threats from weapons their own scientists
designed. And though the focus of tensions between the two nations
now is primarily over bruised feelings and sensitive domestic
issues, the real danger in the next century may not be the threat
to China relations but the threat to US national security.

HOUSTON CANCER CENTERS TO PARTICIPATE IN BREAST CANCER DRUG STUDY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LEIGH HOPPER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Two Houston cancer centers announced Tuesday that they
are enrolling hundreds of women in a giant experiment to compare a
proven breast cancer prevention drug to one that might work even
better.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center and St.
Luke's Episcopal Hospital are among 400 centers in the United
States, Canada and Puerto Rico participating in this test _ one of
the largest breast cancer prevention studies to date.
</P>
<P>
   The Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene will enroll 22,000
post-menopausal women at increased risk for breast cancer to
determine if one drug is superior to the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tamoxifen is a medically proven intervention, but it is not
perfect,'' said Dr. Therese Bevers, principal investigator at M.D.
Anderson. ``Women who are at an increased risk of breast cancer
need options for preventing this disease with a minimum of side
effects, and STAR is a concerted effort to find one.''
</P>
<P>
   M.D. Anderson plans to enroll 400 women, and St. Luke's Texas
Cancer Center 50 to 100 women, in the National Cancer
Institute-supported study.
</P>
<P>
   Tamoxifen and raloxifene belong to a class of drugs called
SERMS, for selective estrogen receptor modulators. They work by
imitating the effects of estrogen in some parts of the body _ for
example its protective effects on bone _ while inhibiting ``bad''
effects, such as stimulating the growth of breast cancer cells.
</P>
<P>
   Tamoxifen was hailed last year as the first pill to prevent
breast cancer, after results from the Breast Cancer Prevention
Trial involving 13,388 women nationwide showed it lowered the
incidence by 49 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But tamoxifen increases a woman's chances of developing
potentially life-threatening health problems: cancer of the uterus
(endometrial cancer), blood clots in the large veins or lungs, and
possibly stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Raloxifene, approved in 1997 to build bones in osteoporosis
patients, has shown exciting potential to fight breast cancer as
well, although studies conducted so far have been too small to
provide definitive conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   In one study of 7,705 women taking raloxifene for osteoporosis,
there was a 70 percent reduction in invasive breast cancer after
two-and-a-half years. An analysis of nine trials showed that
raloxifene was associated with a 55 percent reduction in breast
cancer risk.
</P>
<P>
   Early findings suggest raloxifene doesn't increase risk of
endometrial cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raloxifene may turn out to be a better drug, with fewer
adverse events,'' Bevers said.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Jordan of Magnolia, Texas, who participated in the Breast
Cancer Prevention Trial (and later learned she was taking a
placebo, not tamoxifen), plans to sign up for this experiment as
well. On the practical side, Jordan says she gets better medical
care as a human guinea pig than she does when ``left to my own
devices.''
</P>
<P>
   A stronger motivation stems from the fact that her mother,
grandmother and great-grandmother are all breast cancer survivors.
It was difficult, Jordan said, watching her loved ones struggle
with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want my daughters-in-law to go through what I went
through,'' said Jordan, 56. ``On the loftier side, I'd like to make
a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Women who participate in STAR must be at least 35, be
post-menopausal (or have had a hysterectomy), and have an increased
risk of breast cancer. Every woman considering signing up for the
study will have her risk assessed by a computerized program that
takes into account age, family history of breast cancer, age at
first menstrual period and age of giving birth to first child, and
personal medical history.
</P>
<P>
   A special effort will be made to enroll minority women,
traditionally underrepresented in clinical drug trials. Dr. Lisa
Newman, a breast surgeon at M.D. Anderson, is interested in the
disparities in survival rates among ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   Many investigators believe ethnicity-related differences in
hormone metabolism may be a factor. But data in that area is
limited: in the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial, only 3 percent of
the participants were minorities, only 1.7 percent blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we extrapolate from the tamoxifen study, and apply the
possible benefits of hormonally active agents in chemoprevention in
all women ... we want to know all women of all ethnic backgrounds
can derive these same benefits,'' Newman said.
</P>
<P>
   Women choosing to participate in STAR will be randomly assigned
to take either tamoxifen or raloxifene in pill form daily for five
years.
</P>
<P>
   They will be monitored closely with physical exams and
mammograms. As an added incentive, participants will get free
parking.
</P>
<P>
   Tamoxifen manufacturer Zeneca Pharmaceuticals of Delaware, and
raloxifen-maker Eli Lilly and Co. of Indiana, are providing the
drugs for free. M.D. Anderson is offering financial assistance for
transportation and other miscellaneous expenses so the trial will
be accessible to women of all economic levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make it as easy as possible for women who are
interested to join this study,'' Bevers said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For information about eligibility for the STAR trial, women may
call M.D. Anderson's ``STAR line'' at 713-792-8064, or St. Luke's
at 713-794-6777. Information is available on the Internet at

TWO NETWORKS CURTAIL VIOLENT PROGRAMMING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (e and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It may not last, but at least for the moment the television
industry appears to have been jolted into a heightened sense of
social responsibility by the massacre one month ago at Columbine
High School in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   The WB network decided this week to delay airing the season
finale of ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' because it depicted a high
school graduation that explodes into a violent confrontation. CBS,
which had earlier shelved an episode of ``Promised Land'' involving
a shooting in front of a Denver school, took the extra step last
week yanking a much-touted but bloody new drama called ``Falcone''
off its fall schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``We screened the pilot about a week after Littleton happened,''
CBS Television president Leslie Moonves said Tuesday. ``There were
killings on the boardwalk of New York. We all cringed. At that
moment, it became a noncontender.''
</P>
<P>
   Moonves said Hollywood is buzzing with ``a lot more discussion
than ever before'' about violence. ``It's a question of being
responsible programmers, responsible citizens,'' he added. ``I'm a
big First Amendment guy, and it's very easy to hang your hat on
that, but there's a problem out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Call it the Columbine context: In the wake of the April 20
shootings that left 15 dead and staggered the nation, TV executives
are looking much more closely at the violent content of shows they
put on the air.
</P>
<P>
   Having done its part to saturate the culture with violent
images, television is now on the defensive, as some say the medium
_ along with movies and video games _ should shoulder some of the
blame for episodes of real-life violence. Others suggest network
programmers are overreacting. Pointing to the prevalence of guns
and the weakening of the family structure, they argue that the
entertainment industry is taking the fall for a broader societal
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's looking for a scapegoat after Columbine, and
everybody's looking for an answer,'' said Steve Grubbs, a top
executive at BBDO Inc., a New York agency that buys TV time for
advertisers. ``But there is no one single thing to blame here.
There is no one easy answer available.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it appears that whereas once TV executives might
have rejected criticism of excessive violence in their programs,
they now are listening closely and factoring it into their
decisions _ at least for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should we be mindful of it? Absolutely,'' Jamie Tarses,
president of ABC Entertainment, said Tuesday. ``Everyone, with good
reason, is overly sensitive to it right now.''
</P>
<P>
   As they make decisions on how much violence is too much,
programmers are again feeling the heat from Washington. A bill was
recently introduced in Congress to ban TV violence completely;
though it failed to pass, it signaled renewed congressional concern
about an issue that has often pitted Capitol Hill against
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, President Clinton has used his bully pulpit to
cajole the entertainment industry into handling violence more
responsibly. In a recent radio address, Clinton said that ``too
many vulnerable children . . . are steeped in this culture of
violence'' that makes them more likely to commit crimes, while
``too many creators and purveyors of violence say there is nothing
they can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent poll by the National Institute on Media and the Family,
conducted before the Columbine High shootings, found that parents
were more worried about the violence their children see on
television than about sexual content of the shows.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond political and public pressure, another possible factor
motivating network executives is that they are anticipating
pressure from advertisers who don't want their products associated
with violent fare in the wake of the recent school shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Broadcasters can put two and two together and figure, why give
themselves a headache,'' said Leanne Jenkins, senior vice president
at Hill Holliday Connors Cosmopulos, the second largest ad agency
in New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advertisers are always concerned about the environment they're
putting their message in. Network programmers know they're going to
sell the advertising easier if there's less violence,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Jenkins added, many advertisers will still consider a
show's viewership ratings a more important factor than the amount
of violence when choosing which programs to advertise on.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there are questions about how lasting the TV
industry's current qualms about violence will be. While Moonves
said it is not appropriate now to air ``Falcone,'' he has not ruled
out a spot for it on CBS's midseason schedule in January. As for
the violent graduation episode of ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' the
WB's decision was to delay airing it, not scrap it entirely. The
Fox network has scheduled a program for this fall called ``Harsh
Realm'' that The New York Times said includes ``as heavy a quotient
of violence as any show ever made, though Fox executives have
promised the series will tone the violence down.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, though, the Columbine High massacre seems to have
network executives thinking harder about the possible consequences
of violent imagery, especially among young people.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Kellner, chief executive of the WB, said in yanking the
``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' episode that his decision was ``borne
out of a deep sense of responsibility to the WB's loyal young
audience.'' Previously, the WB had also pulled a ``Buffy'' episode
involving a student who was planning a mass murder at the high
school.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with TV critics Tuesday, CBS's Moonves said
the current efforts to cut down on violence are similar to the
television industry's agreement to go along with the V-chip and to
affix content ratings on programs (both of which occurred amid
congressional pressure).
</P>
<P>
   Antiviolence efforts are ``something we should work very
proactively toward, as opposed to being defensive,'' Moonves said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always try to be responsible when it comes to violence,''
he added. ``There is no question the world has become more
heightened to what has happened recently.''
</P>
<P>
   Tarses, of ABC, predicted that fallout from the Colorado
shootings will influence the topics of numerous dramas on the fall
TV schedule. ``I'm sure some of our dramas will be addressing it in
the future season,'' she said. ``There's obviously a lot to say on
this subject.''
</P>
<P>
   Though she did not link it to the Columbine High shootings,
Tarses said a new program by David Lynch, the writer-producer
behind oft-violent fare like the movie ``Blue Velvet'' and the TV
series ``Twin Peaks,'' will not be on ABC's fall schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in a move that some speculate could be linked to the
climate of concern after Columbine, even the syndicated ``Jerry
Springer Show,'' known for fistfights and general mayhem, has
lately toned down its content.

   JERUSALEM _ Withdrawing from active politics after his electoral
defeat, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will give up his seat in
Parliament and most likely write a book and go on the lecture
circuit in the United States, his spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman, David Bar-Illan, said Netanyahu was planning to
announce his resignation from Parliament on Thursday at a meeting
of his Likud Party. Netanyahu stepped down as head of the Likud
last week when he conceded defeat to Ehud Barak, the Labor Party
leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to be an active member of the party or in
Parliament,'' Bar-Illan said. ``He has a book contract, and he has
very attractive offers for lectures. So I suspect that would be the
route he will take.''
</P>
<P>
   Since conceding defeat barely half an hour after the polls
closed on May 17, Netanyahu, 49, has said nothing in public and
largely disappeared from public view.
</P>
<P>
   A photograph issued by the government press office showed him
smiling and relaxed with his family at a staff farewell party in
his official house, and a newspaper picture Tuesday showed him
waving as he went house hunting with his wife, Sara, here.
Netanyahu is to remain in office until Barak forms a government.
</P>
<P>
   Bar-Illan said Netanyahu had bounced back in the week since his
loss. ``He's very buoyant, very up,'' Bar-Illan said. ``He's
internalized the defeat, and he's looking forward.''
</P>
<P>
   As Barak has begun talks on forming a government, Netanyahu has
cut back his work hours, canceling a Cabinet meeting on Sunday and
an earlier gathering of aides to discuss security issues. Although
those meetings will resume, they will not produce significant
decisions, in deference to Barak's incoming administration, said
another spokesman for Netanyahu, Aviv Bushinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Activity has gone down to a minimum,'' Bushinsky said in a
radio interview. ``I think the prime minister and the ministers are
acting responsibly by avoiding decisions that will bind the
incoming government.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Barak's One Israel bloc, which includes Labor and two allied
parties, held its second day of exploratory talks with other
parties on forming a coalition. Barak is said to be seeking as
broad a coalition as possible to insure stability, including the
Likud as well as Shas, an ultra-Orthodox party of Sephardic Jews,
families from North African and Middle Eastern countries, that has
grown to become the third-largest in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's voters have flooded his office with faxes and e-mail
that demand that Shas be kept out of the coalition. The Shas
leader, Aryeh Deri, has been sentenced to jail after having been
convicted of bribery, and the party's campaign was peppered with
sharp attacks on the justice system. Deri remains free while he
appeals his conviction to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has refused to rule out Shas, provided that Deri resigns _
a demand that Shas negotiators resisted Tuesday. Likud members said
Barak's team had told them that they would be senior partners in
government if they joined his coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Shlomo Ben-Ami, a Labor lawmaker who is on the One Israel
negotiating team, said that by working for a broad coalition Barak
was trying to avoid the mistakes of his predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've learned a lesson from the last seven years,'' Ben-Ami
told Israel Radio. ``During the four years of the Rabin government,
dramatic, important moves were made in the peace process and
economic growth. But in the end they were perceived as rule by half
of the people over the other half, and the moves were cut short.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then,'' Ben-Ami added, ``there was a government in which the
other half ruled, and the result was a serious culture war, deep
division and stalling of the peace process. The lesson is to try
and heal these rifts, to build as wide a coalition as possible. But
not one that is paralyzing. One that creates a consensus for
solution of both internal and external problems.''

 &HT;    Hawks analysis: Slow pace never overtaken in series
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Maybe Hawks fans could take solace from being swept by
the Knicks if their team had competed with more urgency. If being
held to ridicule by the New York City crowd and media had fomented
anger. If being blown out had lit a white fire that would burn with
remembrance, driving the Hawks to do better, never to allow such a
thing to happen again.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the way it is with this bunch.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Hawks know they were tired and short-handed in this
series. They would have given a better account of themselves if
injured starters Alan Henderson and LaPhonso Ellis had been able to
play.
</P>
<P>
   It would be better if these Hawks dwelled on how they lost to
the Knicks and on their stoic acceptance of a winless second round.
It would be better still if they asked why they could not play one
good game in Detroit in the first round, allowing the series to be
extended and setting themselves up for the losses to New York. It
would be better still if they engaged in self-examination over
regular-season blowout losses to lottery teams Dallas, Chicago, New
Jersey and Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Lenny Wilkens long has held the view that there are better
days ahead. ``I want to wring everything out of this season,'' he
once said, ``but next season I think we're really going to be
something.''
</P>
<P>
   His optimism is rooted partly in the four late-first-round draft
picks amassed by Hawks management and a $4.4 million trade
exception that will allow them to bring in an established player.
That the team that goes to training camp in October will be
superior to the one that finished the season is a foregone
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   But it might not be enough. The town and its hard-core fans want
a spirited team. And this is not a spirited team.
</P>
<P>
   Spirited players are out there. Guard John Starks, a fierce
competitor and a much-needed shooter, comes to mind. He is under
contract to Golden State. The Hawks also must add an effective
backup center quick enough to help at power forward for those
inevitable periods when Alan Henderson is injured. Ferocious
Charles Oakley and Olden Polynice, both free agents, would fit the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Options for deal-making are plentiful. The Hawks have enough
talent on the roster to spend a player or two to get better. They
also can acquire one or more of the veterans they need through
sign-and-trade deals.
</P>
<P>
   With draft picks at 17, 20, 21 and 27, they will try to trade as
many as three of them because not all of their needs can be filled
with rookies available so late in the first round. And they already
have youth aplenty in Chris Crawford, Johnson, Roshown McLeod and
Ed Gray, although Gray could be traded.
</P>
<P>
   Among other decisions involving existing players, the Hawks must
determine whether Anthony Johnson can improve enough to become the
alternate point guard they require. Plainly, Mookie Blaylock needs
help. He no longer can play 35 minutes a game and remain effective.
The Hawks must have a backup who can step in for a quarter or so
when Blaylock's game falls apart. Johnson has not given evidence
that he is that player.
</P>
<P>
   One move is certain. Each team has a $2 million ``middle-class
exception'' to the salary cap, and the Hawks will extend theirs to
forward Grant Long, who probably will sign a three-year deal after
rescuing his team so often over the regular season and in the first
round.
</P>
<P>
   But as important as it is to supplement the talent pool and hold
onto their indispensible players, the Hawks must transform
themsevles intoa team with a temper. Find one or two members who
confront their mates in the locker room after half-hearted
performances, who challenge shirkers to near-physical
confrontation, who stoke emotions.
</P>
<P>
   It's not like that now. The players walk softly among each
other. What's more, the coaches and the team executives are very
careful with feelings, as though political correctness were the
most important ingredient on a sports team.
</P>
<P>
   What general manager Pete Babcock, chief of scouting Gary
Wortman and Wilkens have assembled is a team with upper-class
values. For the most part, these are rich men who dress
conservatively, keep their tattoos to the minimum, live in
expensive homes and drive prestigious cars and SUVs. Many are
responsible parents, married with families. Basketball is a job for
them, and they never put in more than the required number of hours.
.
</P>
<P>
   And with all the earnest conversation about winning, no veteran
Hawks player wants it so much that he puts hours of extra work into
his game each day, setting an example for his teammates to follow.
</P>
<P>
   So, when the club decides on its off-season moves, that might be
the place to start. The Hawks should consider adding a few players
to whom the normal 6:30 p.m. arrival time before a home game is
inadequate, who show up an hour early to shoot and work on moves,
to think about the assignment that night.
</P>
<P>
   Keep this in mind: Not one Hawks player ever has played on a
championship team.

NATO'S DUMB BOMBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many things about the war for Kosovo are complicated. It may be
that each side completely and disastrously misread the intentions
of the other. And it seems now that neither Slobodan Milosevic nor
the leaders of the NATO countries can bring themselves to pull the
proper diplomatic levers to end a war that is doing more and more
damage to all parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing should be simple. Precisely because NATO's
justification for making war against Milosevic has been moral and
humanitarian, NATO should not be dropping its precision-guided
missiles and bombs on power plants and water pumps in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The intended effect of targeting electrical generators and water
supplies is not to harm the Serbian army or police. As the
targeters know full well, the military and Milosevic's security
forces have their own generators and their own water sources.
NATO's intent is rather to make Serb civilians suffer.
</P>
<P>
   The theory behind the crescendo of NATO's disabling strikes
against the electrical grid and the water pumps in Serbia is that
the resulting hardship imposed on hospitals, homes, and schools
will demoralize the population, and a demoralized population will
prevail upon Milosevic to accept NATO's terms for peace.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton alluded to this intention in an unusual op-ed
piece that appeared under his name in Sunday's New York Times.
NATO's bombing campaign, Clinton said, will confront Milosevic with
``the prospect of having to answer to his people for starting an
unwinnable conflict that is bringing military failure and economic
ruin.''
</P>
<P>
   As in other wars, however, the primary result of targeting the
civilian population is to make the people suffering under the
bombardment despise an enemy who appears incapable of
distinguishing a despot from his captive subjects.
</P>
<P>
   It is simply wrong for the Western democracies to respond to
Milosevic's tactic of taking 1.8 million Albanian Kosovars hostage
by making hostages of 10 million Serbs.

 &HT;    DALE EARNHARDT JR.:The son also rises
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.C. _ Countdown to E-Day'' is at four days and
counting, and Dale Earnhardt Jr. wishes he could climb under the
hood of his No. 8 Chevrolet Monte Carlo and hide.
</P>
<P>
   For months, anticipation has surrounded the preparations for his
Winston Cup debut in Sunday's Coca-Cola 600 at Lowe's Motor
Speedway. In the final week of hysteria, he seems to be drowning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I would have enjoyed it more,'' Earnhardt said. ``It
will be gone and past, and I'll look back and say, `Man, I just
didn't know how good I had it.' Just like you do everything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could go back to high school, because maybe I took it
too seriously. Maybe that's what I'm doing with this, maybe I'm
taking it too seriously. Maybe it's going to be a lot of fun, but I
just don't think it is.''
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been much fun because all eyes are on Earnhardt Jr.,
the 24-year-old driver many expect to carry NASCAR into the next
millennium. He not only will be under the close scrutiny of his
father, the seven-time Winston Cup champion, but also that of his
legion of fans, who expect him to challenge two-time defending
Winston Cup champion Jeff Gordon _ starting Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime anybody makes a comment about the `Countdown to
E-Day,' I correct them and tell them it's a countdown to my first
qualifying attempt,'' Earnhardt Jr. said. ``Because that's what it
is. Everybody knows how difficult it is to make these races.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Earnhardt Jr., that's what most people don't seem
to understand. As a Winston Cup rookie, there are no provisionals
to fall back on if he doesn't have one of the 36 fastest laps in
this week's qualifying on the 1.5-mile oval.
</P>
<P>
   If he doesn't make the race, Earnhardt Jr. knows the price of
failure could be steep. In fact, it could be as catastrophic to his
career as Geraldo Rivera opening Al Capone's vaults.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're expecting me to be in that race,'' Earnhardt Jr. said.
``Nobody's even thought that we might miss it. Know what I'm
saying? But that ain't the way it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm under pressure where I have to make the race and hopefully
run good. But what if we run poorly and get blown out of the water
with this whole big promotion? I'm worried about that. Everyone
else won't admit it, but I am. You think about that trying to get
to sleep at night.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt Jr. hasn't had much sleep since he signed a five-year
sponsorship deal last year with Budweiser believed to be worth
around $50 million. The 1998 Busch Grand National champion,
Earnhardt Jr. is running a full-time Busch schedule this year, as
well as five Winston Cup races in a car owned by his father. He'll
jump to Winston Cup full-time next year.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Earnhardt Jr. gave up his life, accepting the role
of can't-miss driver, product spokesman and celebrity. Notoriety
has already taken its toll.
</P>
<P>
   After winning seven races in his first full Busch campaign last
year, Earnhardt Jr. got off to an inauspicious start this year. He
finished 14th and 35th in the first two races and fell to fifth in
points. At that point, Earnhardt says, he took back his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't think at all at the race track,'' he said. ``There
was nowhere you could go. The truck was packed. The trailer was
full of people. The lounge was packed full of people. There was
lines standing outside the trailer. There's people crowded around
the race car. There was somebody everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be a good spokesman for our sponsor, but if we don't
win on the race track, they ain't gonna hang around too long, no
matter how much beer we sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt Jr. took over his schedule, trimming back the 77
promotional appearances he was supposed to make between February
and November, so he could spend more time in the race shop. He also
allowed himself a few days a month to get away from racing and
sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt Jr. seems like a breath of fresh air on the circuit, a
driver who won't buckle to corporate pressure and speaks what's on
his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they first announced the Budweiser deal, it got kind of
crazy for a while,'' he said. ``There was a lot of things being
scheduled, and I wasn't finding out about them until the day
before. I don't think we were prepared for it. I didn't feel I had
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's worked out because now I'll do any damn thing they want
me to do. I know I've got three days where I can chill, hang out,
get my thoughts together and catch up on paying bills for the
house. It's taken a lot of the pressure off of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Jeff Burton, among the sport's most visible drivers, seems
amazed at how well Earnhardt Jr. has handled the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's out of whack, but that's sports,'' Burton said. ``It's
like that in every sport. But he hasn't been given anything. His
father's been able to help him, but his father made him earn it. I
think everybody respects him for that. Everybody in here had
somebody help them to get where they are. Nobody in here did it on
their own. And a `name' is not going to win you races.''
</P>
<P>
   Even his father, undoubtedly his biggest critic, seems
impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that will get him, the only thing I think that
can bother him, is the same thing that can get Jeff Gordon or
anybody else,'' Earnhardt said, ``and that's burnout from all the
pressure and the things that go along with it.''

 &HT;    Owners meeting notebook: For price of $800 million, Redskins get
new owner
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bethesda, Md., businessman Daniel M. Snyder was
unanimously approved Tuesday as the new owner of the Washington
Redskins, paying a record $800 million for the franchise. Snyder
overcame his ill-fated partnership with Howard Milstein, who
withdrew his bid in April, to secure the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been an unbelievable journey,'' said Snyder, 34, whose
partners include several members of his family along with Mort
Zuckerman and Fred Drasner, co-publishers of the New York Daily
News. ``To me, personally, this is a lifelong dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder will retain general manager Charley Casserly and coach
Norv Turner at least for this season, but is expected to eventually
hire a club president to oversee day-to-day activities of the
franchise. Current owner John Kent Cooke failed in his attempts to
buy the team through the trustees appointed by his father, the late
Jack Kent Cooke.
</P>
<P>
   Deion update
</P>
<P>
   Dallas owner Jerry Jones said he is not close to a decision yet
on cornerback Deion Sanders, whose rehabilitation from toe surgery
is expected to take another four to five months. There has been
speculation that the Cowboys will consider releasing Sanders after
June 1 to gain salary cap relief. ``Whatever we do, it will be a
business decision,'' said Jones, who has a strong personal regard
for Sanders. ``But we feel he'll be able to play.'' Sanders has a
salary cap number of $8.2 million and Dallas would realize a $6.5
million rebate if he is released.The fallback guy
</P>
<P>
   Billionaire Marvin Davis, who has flirted several times with the
purchase of pro sports franchises, has signed an option for a land
tract at Hollywood Park. Apparently Davis is attempting to position
himself as an alternative to Michael Ovitz and Eli Broad, both of
whom will bid for the expansion franchise in Los Angeles. The plans
submitted by Ovitz and Broad both call for the refurbishing of the
Los Angeles Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly
</P>
<P>
   The four-year deal Georgia offensive tackle Chris Terry signed
with Carolina on Monday is worth $2.86 million over four years. . .

owners today. Owners will award Super Bowl XXXVII, with San Diego
expected to get the nod over Miami.

 &HT;    So many things to do in L.A.
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They toted scale-model facsimiles of their designs for
refurbishing the Los Angeles Coliseum into the meeting room of an
Atlanta hotel on Tuesday. Both of the groups vying for the NFL's
next expansion franchise displayed high-tech models of what the
historic but crumbling edifice might look like when revamped for
the 2002 season.
</P>
<P>
   The models featured trees one-tenth the size of Bonsais,
mini-practice fields for the new club, luxury suites for the
Hollywood gentry and tiny automobiles tooling along the streets.
Given that the new owner could turn out to be the man who provides
the most on-site parking spots, garages were of varying size and
shape.
</P>
<P>
   Conspicuously absent from both models, however, were the fans in
the stands.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for real-estate magnate Eli Broad and
entertainment mogul Michael Ovitz, the prominent front men for the
two potential ownership groups, is to win fans back to a market
abandoned by the Rams and Raiders after the 1994 season.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL wants to be back in Los Angeles, an area that could
command the largest franchise fee in league history.
</P>
<P>
   At the league meetings in March, the owners established a Sept.
15 deadline for the city to present a viable and united plan for
returning a franchise there. Although the city of Houston has an
advantage in planning and public financing, Los Angeles is the
coveted spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm not 100 percent convinced that (the fans will embrace
the NFL again),'' Ovitz said. ``Personally, I think they're pretty
fed up. Those fans there have found other things to do.''
</P>
<P>
   John Semcken, executive vice president for the New Coliseum
Partners, a group headed by Broad and Ed Roski, termed Los Angeles
``a market that hasn't been that successful in the last two
decades,'' and some owners clearly shared that sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure there are some concerns,'' Cleveland Browns president
Carmen Policy said about the nation's second-largest market.
``We've been gone from there a long time now. We not only have to
win back fans, but we also have to create new fans as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles is ``a very rare place'' because of its diversions,
New Orleans Saints owner Tom Benson said. ``But you've got 16
million people to draw from. If you can't put 70,000 people into a
stadium with that to draw from, you must not be doing things
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Broad and Ovitz cited the need to do things the right way and
creation of a fan-friendly atmosphere. The man who gets the team
might be the one who garners the most civic support _ a critical

 &HT;    AFC division Cinnabon names chief operating officer
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ AFC Enterprises' Bakery Cafe Group said Tuesday that
Barbara Timm-Brock has been named chief operating officer of
Cinnabon Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Timm-Brock was formerly chief product officer. As COO, she will
be responsible for Cinnabon's franchise operations, training,
development services, product management and licensing.
</P>
<P>
   Her appointment ``increases the bench strength of our management
team,'' said Gregg Kaplan, president of AFC's Bakery Cafe Group.
Timm-Brock has extensive experience in the restaurant industry
including stints at Olive Garden and Pizza Hut. She is also
chairman of the Women's Foodservice Forum, an executive leadership
development organization formed to increase the presence of women
in senior-level positions.
</P>
<P>
   Cinnabon, which recently moved its headquarters to Atlanta from
Seattle, has more than 360 locations and 1998 sales of $158
million. AFC Enterprises also owns Churchs Chicken, Popeyes Chicken
&AMP; Biscuits and Seattle's Best Coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Timm-Brock's appointment comes as the AFC division institutes
several changes, including launching a new franchising effort,
expanding its site portfolio, developing a new cafe design and
introducing new products.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Yurgo, vice president of new business development, said
the company expects to have 1,000 new units, of which 75 percent
will be franchised. The company is also exploring new sites,
including kiosks for colleges and carts for arenas and stadiums.
Cinnabon plans to update its stores, using warmer colors and
improving signs and menus.

 &HT;    CNN enters alliance with IDG
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ CNN News Group announced Tuesday a $50 million deal to
augment its Internet and computer content, both on air and online,
through an expanded alliance with computer publisher IDG.
</P>
<P>
   The deal calls for Atlanta-based CNN to start a new
consumer-oriented computer show using IDG content and writers. IDG
and CNN would also advertise with each other, and CNN will take an
undisclosed minority stake in IDG.net, the parent company's
Internet unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly we are looking to expand our relationships across
multimedia platforms,'' said CNN News Group Chairman, President and
Chief Executive Tom Johnson. ``We're in a new world today and we've
got to be prepared to seize opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's deal is the second of its kind for Atlanta-based CNN,
which earlier struck a broad alliance to co-brand health and
medical content with Web site WebMD.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, CNN will air this fall a new 30-minute
weekly computer show on the weekend that will feature IDG content
and journalists. The show will have a consumer spin, with news and
features about electronic gadgets and advances in the Internet and
home computing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology news, we have realized, is very important to our
viewership,'' said Rob Tolleson, CNN's vice president for business
opportunities. So is health and medical news, which is why the
company struck the earlier deal with WebMD.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said his company, which operates five cable TV news
channels, was continually looking for other partnerships. ``We've
been presented with a number of opportunities,'' said Johnson.
``We're looking carefully at what would work best for us.''
</P>
<P>
   IDG is a Boston-based company that publishes, among other
things, the ``PC World'' and ``InfoWeek'' magazines and the
``Dummy'' series of how-to computer books.
</P>
<P>
   IDG and CNN are no strangers, with IDG providing content for the
past year to CNN's Web unit, CNN Interactive. That deal has gone so
well, both companies said, that they decided to expand it.
</P>
<P>
   The CNN TV show represents a big opportunity for IDG, which has
no presence now on television, said Laurie Morgan, president of the
company's Internet operations. IDG's biggest competitor, Ziff
Davis, started a cable TV channel last year devoted to computers
and the Internet. It's called ZDTV and is carried on some cable
systems in metro Atlanta and satellite broadcaster DirecTV.

 &HT;    Protest at Home Depot
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Environmental activists protesting the sale of wood
from old-growth forests plan to face off with Home Depot officials
at the company's annual meeting today.
</P>
<P>
   Several groups, including Greenpeace and the Sierra Club, plan
to demonstrate before the meeting. Inside, a group of shareholders
led by Trillium Asset Management will present a proposal that asks
the company to review sales of so-called old-growth wood and take
steps to stop selling it.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups charge that Atlanta-based Home Depot, the
world's largest retailer of building products, sells some wood
products that come from endangered forests in Indonesia, Canada and
the Amazon. The activists say it's the retailer's responsibility to
stop buying old-growth wood from logging companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home Depot may not be using the actual chainsaw to cut down
these forests, but they're fueling the chainsaw,'' said Michael
Brune of Rainforest Action Network. On Tuesday, about a dozen
protesters representing the San Francisco-based group demonstrated
at the Home Depot on Sidney Marcus Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Tuesday, Greenpeace installed a 10,000-square-foot mock
Home Depot logo in a quarter-acre of clear-cut land in British
Columbia. While Rainforest Action Network is focusing on the sale
of old-growth wood, Greenpeace and Sierra Club are protesting Home
Depot for allegedly buying from vendors that clear-cut forests.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot said it's difficult to track the source of building
materials. ``Forest conservation is an important issue, and we are
working with our vendors and other environmental advisers to better
understand the source of wood and wood products,'' said Suzanne
Apple, Home Depot's vice president of community affairs and
environmental programs.
</P>
<P>
   Apple noted that the retailer works with a third-party certifier
to verify that products live up to environmentally safe claims. For
example, Home Depot sells a mahogany door made from wood that was
either taken from a fallen tree or from a dense forest that needed
to be thinned, she said.

FROM KOSOVO TO `POTATO CITY,' IDAHO, THE HARD WAY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Idaho, N.J.)   (dal) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOISE, Idaho _ As Mirsade Bejiqi and her family flew from Fort
Dix to their new home here, she braced herself for loneliness and
isolation. Perhaps nobody would bother meeting them, a handful of
near-penniless refugees from Kosovo hurtling toward ``Potato
City,'' as she called Idaho's capital.
</P>
<P>
   How would she find her family's luggage, the 20-year-old Ms.
Bejiqi wondered? Maybe somebody would show up to meet the Bejiqis,
but how would she recognize him?
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Boise recognized her. Forty people showed up
at the Boise airport on Thursday night to greet her; her father,
Ajet Bejiqi, a factory worker driven out of Pristina less than two
months ago; her mother, Bukurije, and her three brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Islamic Community Center came out to meet them,
bringing translators, and so did the head of the local refugee
resettlement agency. Rabbi Daniel Fink of Boise's Congregation
Ahavath Beth Israel and his wife, Laura Rappaport, also a rabbi,
who led the push for the synagogue to sponsor some refugees from
Kosovo, were there. The family that was to shelter the Bejiqis for
their first two weeks here _ and chronicle the experience for a
newspaper _ welcomed them along with reporters and television
crews.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was for me, like, amazing,'' said Mirsade Bejiqi, the
eldest of the Bejiqi children and the most proficient in English.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight, it seems, the roughly 4,000 refugees who have landed
at Fort Dix, N.J., in the last few weeks have become emblems of the
Kosovo cause. Resettlement agencies across the country report the
kind of overwhelming outpouring of sympathy for victims of the
Serbian campaign against Albanians in Kosovo that eluded the 78,000
refugees from other wars and slaughters who reached the United
States last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never heard this before from people, this wanting to do
something,'' said Lisa Reeves, director of the Agency for New
Americans, which brought the Bejiqis here. ``We're very excited to
be the first city in America to settle the Kosovars.''
</P>
<P>
   Though more than 700 of the refugees had been settled with
relatives across the United States, the Bejiqis and two families
sent to Seattle and Sarasota, Fla., were the first to leave Fort
Dix to make their way on their own in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we publicly said that we'll receive some families from
Kosovo, people really did start to call,'' Ms. Reeves said. Her
agency has sponsored refugees from Bosnia, Congo, Rwanda and
Russia, and Kurds from Iraq. This year, it is bringing 165 refugees
to this city of 150,000.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the nonprofit groups that resettle refugees in the
United States, accustomed to toiling in obscurity, were astounded
by the flood of interest. Touched by the sight of families trudging
from Kosovo over the mountains to Macedonia and Albania, Americans
began showering resettlement agencies with donations, volunteers
and offers of clothing, jobs, toys and places to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a certain amount of competition out there,'' said
Richard Parkins, national director of the Episcopal Migration
Ministries in New York. ``The reality right now is there will not
be a sufficient number of refugees for all of the groups that want
to be involved in the resettlement.''
</P>
<P>
   Some resettlement officials believe the public has responded so
strongly because the Albanians from Kosovo are seen as victims of a
government with which the United States is at war. Others suggest
that the interest, unlike the lesser concern for black refugees of,
say, Sudan, is racial, although Bosnians, who are also European,
never prompted the same outpouring.
</P>
<P>
   All agree that daily television coverage of Serbian atrocities
has fueled much of the reaction.
</P>
<P>
   The selective sympathy does not go unnoticed by less-cared-for
refugees of other conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Bashkim Selace, 29, a chip maker for Micron Technology, fled to
the United States from Albania in 1988. Eager to help the Kosovo
refugees, he went to the Boise airport to translate for the Bejiqis
but could not help remembering his own landing in Boise. One man
sponsored him, putting him alone with three other Albanian
newcomers in an apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not quite a warm welcome,'' Selace said, ``even though
the guy tried. He did his best, but it wasn't anything like what
the refugees now are receiving.''
</P>
<P>
   The people Selace met in his new home knew nothing of his ordeal
to flee communism by crossing the mountains into Yugoslavia. ``Most
people didn't even know where Albania was,'' Selace recalled.
``They thought I meant Alabama.''
</P>
<P>
   Azad Abdullah, 22, fled Iraq 11 years ago, after Saddam Hussein
killed 50,000 Kurds there with mustard gas. Before coming to the
United States by way of Guam, he spent five years in Turkish
refugee camps, where he said the authorities would shoot and
sometimes kill refugees.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, ``everybody knows what's going on,'' Abdullah said.
``It's a hard story, a tragedy. But I feel like we've been through
more, but we were not advertised.''
</P>
<P>
   For Boise, being among the first cities in America to embrace
its own Albanian refugee family was a milestone.
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding the Aryan Nation and other extremist groups
living in the mountains of Idaho, Boise's leadership wants to shed
its image as an insular, parochial place. Businesses like Micron
Technology and Hewlett-Packard have begun a campaign to broaden
people's attitudes about foreign cultures, many of which are
finding a home in Boise.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul Yunis, a Pakistani manager at Hewlett-Packard who heads
the city's Islamic Community Center, said, ``They're finding they
can create a very tolerant and welcoming environment in the
company, and recruit people from all over, but employees still have
to deal with what's out there when they walk out the door at the
end of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the highways, billboards for Christianity warn motorists
that it is the only avenue to heaven. Yunis figures whoever put up
the signs had not thought about how they looked to Boise's few
thousand Muslims and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   The city is already home to 1,000 or so Bosnian refugees.
Unemployment here is low and housing is affordable. Because of low
interest rates and a first-time homebuyer's program, scores of
Bosnian refugees have bought houses for roughly the same amount
they had been paying in rent.
</P>
<P>
   Ajet Bejiqi, 45, said his first priority was to learn English
and find a job. This week, resettlement workers will test the
Bejiqis' English and help them apply for medical benefits, food
stamps and cash assistance.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the family has been settling in, with members
of Congregation Ahavath Beth Israel taking the Bejiqis on a retreat
in the mountains over the weekend and to Ponderosa State Park.
</P>
<P>
   The family seemed grateful for the attention and warmth, but
ached for the friends they had made on their journey from Kosovo.
``I need to thank these people,'' Mirsade Bejiqi said, ``but they
are not so close to me. I love my people more than anyone in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Ajet Bejiqi said he had been struck by how much Boise looked
like Pristina. But as he prepared to begin a new life, the home he
lost felt more distant than ever. ``Spiritually, Kosovo is very far
away now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mirsade Bejiqi offered advice for other refugees expected to
follow them to Boise: ``Forget all the bad things. Start a new life
here. And whenever it's better, we'll go back.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Many of the media excesses that have been widely criticized
recently _ such as the sensationalized coverage of the Colorado
school shootings and the pack harassment of Monica Lewinsky _ are
best remedied by the market of free opinion rather than tight
regulations that might impinge on important First Amendment rights.
</P>
<P>
   But the Supreme Court has shown good sense in barring a
particular excess that has nothing to do with free speech or
legitimate news gathering.
</P>
<P>
   This is the practice of reporters accompanying police on raids
and bursting into private homes or apartments as the lawmen
confront, search, and sometimes arrest the inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   Since surprise can be a key component of such raids, cameras
often capture dramatic images. Video footage from police raids has
become a staple of popular ``real life'' TV shows portraying police
at work. These shows are essentially entertainment with little news
value.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court decision dwelt not on how the material is used
but on the distinction between public and private property. Law
enforcement personnel cannot burst into a private dwelling unless
they have a search warrant or specific circumstances require it.
News organizations can operate unfettered in public spaces but have
no right to invade private property and cannot acquire the right
secondhand from the police.
</P>
<P>
   The consequences can be oppressive. In one of the cases the
Supreme Court decided this week, a Maryland couple's home was
raided early one morning while the husband was in his undershorts
and the wife in a nightgown. The police wrestled the man to the
floor and put a gun to his head. They were seeking the couple's
son, who was not at home but turned himself in later. A Washington
Post reporter and photographer accompanied the police. The Post, to
its credit, didn't run pictures. But the court said that in the
future, the police could be held liable for inviting the media in.
</P>
<P>
   Press freedoms should be robust, but not so bloated as to
violate personal property rights and damage the press's own
credibility.

   It is an unpleasant fact of life that many countries, friend and

technological and nuclear secrets.

   In the case of China, the revelations and recommendations of a

information; discloses a pattern of laxity in protecting it; and
leaves no doubt that the fault lies with US authorities when a
foreign country succeeds in stealing secrets of value.
</P>
<P>
   China's pursuit of nuclear weapons data, the committee found,
took a ``mosaic'' approach, combining some traditional espionage
methods with a painstaking accumulation of disparate pieces of
information from scientific exchanges and open sources. All the
diverse bits of material were then pieced together in China.
</P>
<P>
   The result was not to bestow on China a nuclear weapons
capability that the country could not have acquired on its own, the
report found, but rather to permit Beijing to modernize its small
nuclear arsenal more cheaply and ``sooner than would otherwise have
been possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Although China's espionage went undetected through the
administrations of Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and George Bush,
the Clinton administration has an obligation to explain its
dilatory response to warnings it received concerning Chinese spying
as early as 1995 and '96.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno, who has displayed stunning lapses
of judgment in the past, needs to explain why she rejected FBI
requests for wiretapping authority in the investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the United States must maintain an even keel in its
crucial relationship with Beijing, avoiding a breakdown but
refusing to be treated as a patsy.

CONFLICTING ACCOUNTS GIVEN IN TOBACCO FEE FIGHT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Dan Morales and a former top aide have offered
conflicting accounts of why the former assistant quit the state's
anti-tobacco lawsuit after signing a contract with Morales.
</P>
<P>
   The contract is central to Texas Attorney General John Cornyn's
allegations that Morales, the former attorney general, tried to
fraudulently secure $260 million in legal fees for a friend,
Houston attorney Marc Murr, in the tobacco case.
</P>
<P>
   Morales told a national arbitration panel that set legal fees
that Will Pryor, his former top assistant, dropped out of a Jan.
31, 1997, contract with him and Murr because Pryor couldn't meet a
financial commitment to help pay for the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   But Pryor says he quit the case because it soon became obvious
that he wouldn't have much work to do. He said he also was
concerned that his former employment with Morales could raise
questions about the potentially lucrative contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my perspective, it really didn't have anything to do with
financial considerations,'' Pryor said Tuesday. He said he
consulted with Morales a few times after signing the contract but
soon dropped out because ``my involvement wasn't necessary. In any
meaningful sense, I really wasn't doing anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Pryor, in a recent letter to Cornyn, said he was surprised
months later when Morales told him that Murr had signed a separate
contract. ``But what services Marc actually provided, or did not
provide, is something I have no knowledge of,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pryor was Morales' top assistant during most of the Democrat's
first term as attorney general from 1991-94. He was an
attorney-mediator in private practice in Dallas by the time Morales
asked him to help represent the state in the tobacco suit.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn, who succeeded Morales on Jan. 1, has accused his
predecessor of using some signatures from the contract with Pryor
and Murr to fabricate a separate contract with Murr alone that
carries the same 1997 date. Cornyn contends the fake contract was
created much later but was backdated to bolster Murr's claim for
fees.
</P>
<P>
   The Murr-Pryor contract called for the two to share a 6 percent
contingency fee; the document with Murr alone specified simply a
``reasonable fee.''
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to Cornyn, Pryor said that Morales told him and
Murr that adding them to the tobacco suit would serve as a
``helpful reminder'' to the state's five other tobacco lawyers that
Morales was in charge.
 &UR;  &LR; ``Dan was becoming increasingly apprehensive that the `trial team'
of very prominent and successful trial lawyers could successfully
be `reined in,''' Pryor recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Other lawyers have contended that Murr did little work on the
suit, while Morales has insisted that Murr played a crucial role,
often as a behind-the-scenes adviser.
</P>
<P>
   According to an affidavit recently obtained by the Chronicle,
Morales told the national arbitrators in a closed-door meeting in
New York that Pryor had to drop out because he couldn't afford to
join other outside lawyers in financing the suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Pryor was not able to make the financial commitment in
time, so we just stuck with the individual contract for Mr. Murr,''
Morales said in the Dec. 5 meeting, where he testified on Murr's
behalf just a few weeks before leaving office.
</P>
<P>
   Each of five other outside lawyers _ a group headed by Walter
Umphrey of Beaumont _ was required to spend $2 million in up-front
costs. They said they spent more than that but were reimbursed by
tobacco companies after the suit was settled.
</P>
<P>
   Morales told the national arbitrators that Murr was prepared to
contribute $2 million but never was asked to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Pryor said Tuesday that Morales initially proposed a contract
similar to the Umphrey group's but that he told Morales early on
that he couldn't afford to put up $2 million, so the contract was
changed to reflect that.
</P>
<P>
   In an April 12 letter to Cornyn's office, which followed the
attorney general's questioning of Pryor as part of the
investigation into the Murr contract, Pryor said he realized some
weeks or months after signing the contract that ``active,
meaningful participation in the litigation was simply not to be.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I was concerned about the appearance of impropriety
that some would perceive, once the contract became public
knowledge, because of my relationship with Dan, especially if I was
not as active or involved in the litigation as had been
contemplated.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Murr recently withdrew his claim against the state for
some $260 million in legal fees, he still is to receive $1 million
from cigarette makers under a separate, national arbitration award
entered in December. The national arbitrators awarded $3.3 billion
to the Umphrey team of five outside lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Murr's involvement is still being investigated by the
FBI, according to Cornyn. Murr has repeatedly refused comment.

REPORT ON WHAT CHINA KNOWS ABOUT U.S. MISSILE TECHNOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following is the overview from the report of the
Select Committee on U.S. National Security and Military/Commercial
Concerns With the People's Republic of China. References and a few
duplicate sentences have been deleted.
</P>
<P>
   OVERVIEW
</P>
<P>
   Important Note: This declassified report summarizes many
important findings and judgments contained in the Select
Committee's classified Report, issued Jan. 3, 1999. U.S.
intelligence and law enforcement agencies within the Clinton
Administration have determined that other significant findings and
judgments contained in the Select Committee's classified report
cannot be publicly disclosed without affecting national security or
ongoing criminal investigations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. The People's Republic of China (P.R.C.) has stolen design
information on the United States' most advanced thermonuclear
weapons.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ The Select Committee judges that the P.R.C.'s next generation
of thermonuclear weapons, currently under development, will exploit
elements of stolen U.S. design information.
</P>
<P>
   _ P.R.C. penetration of our national weapons laboratories spans
at least the past several decades and almost certainly continues
today.
</P>
<P>
   A. The People's Republic of China has stolen design information
on the United States' most advanced thermonuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   . . . These thefts of nuclear secrets from our national weapons
laboratories enabled the P.R.C. to design, develop, and
successfully test modern strategic nuclear weapons sooner than
would otherwise have been possible. The stolen U.S. nuclear secrets
give the P.R.C. design information on thermonuclear weapons on a
par with our own.
</P>
<P>
   The P.R.C. thefts from our National Laboratories began at least
as early as the late 1970's, and significant secrets are known to
have been stolen as recently as the mid-1990's. Such thefts almost
certainly continue to the present.
</P>
<P>
   _ The stolen information includes classified information on
seven U.S. thermonuclear warheads, including every currently
deployed thermonuclear warhead in the U.S. ballistic missile
arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   _ The stolen information also includes classified design
information for an enhanced radiation weapon (commonly known as the
neutron bomb), which neither the United States, nor any other
nation, has yet deployed.
</P>
<P>
   _ The P.R.C. has obtained classified information on the
following U.S. thermonuclear warheads, as well as a number of
associated re-entry vehicles (the hardened shell that protects the
thermonuclear warhead during re-entry).
</P>
<P>
   WARHEAD........MISSILE...............CURRENTLY DEPLOYED
</P>
<P>
   W-88 ..........Trident D-5 SLBM..................Yes
</P>
<P>
   W-87...........Peacekeeper ICBM..................Yes
</P>
<P>
   W-78...........Minuteman III (Mark 12A) ICBM.....Yes
</P>
<P>
   W-76...........Trident C-4 SLBM..................Yes
</P>
<P>
   W-70...........Lance SRBM.........................No
</P>
<P>
   W-62...........Minuteman III ICBM................Yes
</P>
<P>
   W-56...........Minuteman II ICBM..................No
</P>
<P>
   In addition, in the mid-1990's the P.R.C. stole, possibly from a
U.S. national weapons laboratory, classified thermonuclear weapons
information that cannot be identified in this unclassified report.
Because this recent espionage case is currently under investigation
and involves sensitive intelligence sources and methods, the
Clinton administration has determined that further information may
not be made public without affecting national security or ongoing
criminal investigations.
</P>
<P>
   The W-88, a miniaturized, tapered warhead, is the most
sophisticated nuclear weapon the United States has ever built. In
the U.S. arsenal, it is mated to the D-5 submarine-launched
ballistic missile carried aboard the Trident nuclear submarine. The
United States learned about the theft of the W-88 Trident D-5
warhead information, as well as about the theft of information
regarding several other nuclear weapons, in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The P.R.C. has stolen U.S. design information and other
classified information for neutron bomb warheads. The P.R.C. stole
classified U.S. information about the neutron bomb from a U.S.
national weapons laboratory. The U.S. learned of the theft of this
classified information on the neutron bomb in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970's, the P.R.C. stole design information on the
U.S. W-70 warhead from the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory. The U.S.
government first learned of this theft several months after it took
place. The W-70 warhead contains elements that may be used either
as a strategic thermonuclear weapon, or as an enhanced radiation
weapon (``neutron bomb''). The P.R.C. tested the neutron bomb in
1988.

 WASHINGTON: in 1988. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Select Committee is aware of other P.R.C. thefts of U.S.
thermonuclear weapons-related secrets. The Clinton Administration
has determined that further information about P.R.C. thefts of U.S.
thermonuclear weapons-related secrets cannot be publicly disclosed
without affecting national security.
</P>
<P>
   The P.R.C. acquired this and other classified U.S. nuclear
weapons information as the result of a 20-year intelligence
collection program to develop modern thermonuclear weapons,
continuing to this very day, that includes espionage, review of
unclassified publications, and extensive interactions with
scientists from the Department of Energy's national weapons
laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   The Select Committee has found that the primary focus of this
long-term, ongoing PRC intelligence collection effort has been on
the following national weapons laboratories: Los Alamos, Lawrence
Livermore, Oak Ridge, Sandia.
</P>
<P>
   The Select Committee judges that the P.R.C. will exploit
elements of the stolen design information on the P.R.C.'s next
generation of thermonuclear weapons. The P.R.C. plans to supplement
its silo-based CSS-4 ICBM's targeted on U.S. cities with mobile
ICBM's, which are more survivable because they are more difficult
to find than silo-based missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The P.R.C. has three mobile ICBM programs currently under way _
two road-mobile and one submarine-launched program _ all of which
will be able to strike the United States. The first of these new
People's Liberation Army (P.L.A.) mobile ICBM's, the DF-31, may be
tested in 1999, and could be deployed as soon as 2002. These mobile
missiles require small warhead designs, of which the stolen U.S.
design information is the most advanced in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the P.R.C. could choose to use elements of the
stolen nuclear weapons design information _ including the neutron
bomb _ on intermediate- and short-range ballistic missiles, such as
its CSS-6 missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The P.R.C. has the infrastructure and technical ability to use
elements of the stolen U.S. warhead design information in the
P.L.A.'s next generation of thermonuclear weapons. The Select
Committee concludes that the production tools and processes
required by the P.R.C. to produce small thermonuclear warheads
based on the stolen U.S. design information, including the stolen
W-88 information, would be similar to those developed or available
in a modern aerospace or precision-guided munitions industry. The
Select Committee judges that the P.R.C. has such infrastructure and
is capable of such production.
</P>
<P>
   The Select Committee judges that the P.R.C. is likely to
continue its work on advanced thermonuclear weapons based on the
stolen U.S. design information. The P.R.C. could begin serial
production of such weapons during the next decade in connection
with the development of its next generation of intercontinental
ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   A series of P.R.C. nuclear weapons test explosions from 1992 to
1996 began a debate in the U.S. Government about whether the
P.R.C.'s designs for its new generation of nuclear warheads were in
fact based on stolen U.S. classified information. The apparent
purpose of these P.R.C. tests was to develop smaller, lighter
thermonuclear warheads, with an increased yield-to-weight ratio.
</P>
<P>
   The United States did not become fully aware of the magnitude of
the counterintelligence problem at the Department of Energy
national weapons laboratories until 1995. In 1995 the United States
received a classified P.R.C. document that demonstrated that the
P.R.C. had obtained U.S. design information on the W-88 warhead and
technical information concerning approximately half a dozen other
U.S. thermonuclear warheads and associated re-entry vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The document was provided by a P.R.C. national, unsolicited by
the C.I.A. _ a ``walk in.'' This individual approached the C.I.A.
outside the P.R.C. and turned over a number of documents. Among
these was an official P.R.C. document classified ``Secret'' by the
P.R.C.
</P>
<P>
   This P.R.C. document included, among other matters, stolen U.S.
design information on the W-88 thermonuclear warhead used on the
Trident D-5 missile, as well as U.S. technical information on
several other strategic U.S. nuclear warheads. The document
recognized that the U.S. weapons represented the state-of-the-art
against which P.R.C. nuclear weapons should be measured.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-1996 the C.I.A. had determined that the individual who
provided the information was secretly under the direction of the
P.R.C. intelligence services. The C.I.A. and other U.S.
intelligence community analysts have nevertheless concluded that
the classified P.R.C. document contained U.S. thermonuclear warhead
design information and other technical information on U.S. nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The stolen U.S. nuclear secrets give the P.R.C. design
information on thermonuclear weapons on a par with our own.
Currently deployed P.R.C. ICBM's targeted on U.S. cities are based
on 1950's-era nuclear weapons designs. With the stolen U.S.
technology, the P.R.C. has leaped, in a handful of years, from
1950's-era strategic nuclear capabilities to the more modern
thermonuclear weapons designs. These modern thermonuclear weapons
took the United States decades of effort, hundreds of millions of
dollars and numerous nuclear tests to achieve.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Such small, modern warheads are necessary for all of the
elements of a modern intercontinental nuclear force, including: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Road-mobile ICBM's
</P>
<P>
   _ Submarine-launched ICBM's
</P>
<P>
   _ ICBM's with multiple warheads (MRV's or MIRV's)
</P>
<P>
   The P.R.C. has an ongoing program to use these modern
thermonuclear warheads on its next generation of ICBM's, currently
in development. Without the nuclear secrets stolen from the United
States, it would have been virtually impossible for the P.R.C. to
fabricate and test successfully small nuclear warheads prior to its
1996 pledge to adhere to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   B. The Select Committee judges that elements of the stolen
information on U.S. thermonuclear warhead designs will assist the
P.R.C. in building its next generation of mobile ICBM's, which may
be tested this year.
</P>
<P>
   The stolen U.S. design information will assist the P.R.C. in
building smaller nuclear warheads _ vital to the success of the
P.R.C.'s ongoing efforts to develop survivable, mobile missiles.
Current P.R.C. ICBM's, which are silo-based, are more vulnerable to
attack than mobile missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The P.R.C. has currently under way three intercontinental mobile
missile programs _ two road-mobile, and one submarine-launched. All
of these missiles are capable of targeting the United States. The
first of these, the road-mobile solid-propellant DF-31, may be
tested in 1999. Given a successful flight-test program, the DF-31
could be ready for deployment in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The Select Committee judges that the P.R.C. will in fact use a
small nuclear warhead on its new generation ICBM's. The small,
mobile missiles that the PRC is developing require smaller warheads
than the large, heavy, 1950's-era warheads developed for the
P.R.C.'s silo-based missiles. The main purpose of a series of
nuclear tests conducted by the P.R.C. between 1992 and 1996 was
evidently to develop new smaller, lighter warheads with an
increased yield-to-weight ratio for use with the P.R.C.'s new,
mobile nuclear forces.
</P>
<P>
   The Select Committee judges that the P.R.C. will exploit
elements of the stolen U.S. thermonuclear weapons design
information on its new ICBM's currently under development. The
advanced U.S. thermonuclear warheads for which the P.R.C. has
stolen U.S. design information are significantly smaller than those
for which the P.R.C.'s silo-based missiles were designed. The U.S.
designs, unlike those in the P.R.C.'s currently deployed arsenal,
can be used on smaller mobile missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The Select Committee judges that:
</P>
<P>
   _ The P.R.C. is likely to continue to work on small
thermonuclear warheads based on stolen U.S. design information &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ The P.R.C. has the infrastructure and ability to produce such
warheads, including warheads based on elements of the stolen U.S.
W-88 Trident D5 design information &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ The P.R.C. could begin serial production of small
thermonuclear warheads during the next decade in conjunction with
its new generation of road-mobile missiles &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ The introduction of small warheads into P.L.A. service could
coincide with the initial operational capability of the DF-31,
which could be ready for deployment in 2002 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These small warhead designs will make it possible for the P.R.C.
to develop and deploy missiles with multiple re-entry vehicles
(MRV's or independently targetable MIRV's). Multiple re-entry
vehicles increase the effectiveness of a ballistic missile force by
multiplying the number of warheads a single missile can carry as
many as tenfold. Multiple re-entry vehicles also can help to
counter missile defenses. For example, multiple re-entry vehicles
make it easier for the P.R.C. to deploy penetration aids with its
ICBM warheads in order to defeat antimissile defenses.
</P>
<P>
   The Select Committee is aware of reports that the P.R.C. has in
the past undertaken efforts related to technology with MIRV
applications. Experts agree that the P.R.C. now has the capability
to develop and deploy silo-based intercontinental ballistic
missiles with multiple re-entry vehicles (MIRV's or MRV's).
</P>
<P>
   Experts also agree that the P.R.C. could have this capability
for its new mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles within a
reasonable period of years that is consistent with its plans to
deploy these new mobile missiles. The P.R.C. could pursue one or
more penetration aids in connection with its new nuclear missiles.
</P>
<P>
   If the P.R.C. violates the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty by
testing surreptitiously, it could further accelerate its nuclear
development. The Select Committee judges that, if the P.R.C. were
successful in stealing nuclear test codes, computer models and data
from the United States, it could further accelerate its nuclear
development. By using such stolen codes and data in conjunction
with High Performance Computers (H.P.C.'s) already acquired by the
P.R.C., the P.R.C. could diminish its need for further nuclear
testing to evaluate weapons and proposed design changes.

 WASHINGTON: design changes. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The possession of the stolen U.S. test data could greatly reduce
the level of H.P.C. performance required for such tasks. For these
reasons, the Select Committee judges that the P.R.C. has and will
continue to aggressively target for theft our nuclear test codes,
computer models, and data.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States has been the victim of systematic
espionage successfully targeted against our most advanced nuclear
weapons designs _ and although the Select Committee judges that the
P.R.C. will exploit elements of those designs for its new
generation of ICBM's _ the United States retains an overwhelming
qualitative and quantitative advantage in deployed strategic
nuclear forces. Nonetheless, in a crisis in which the United States
confronts the P.R.C.'s conventional and nuclear forces at the
regional level, a modernized P.R.C. strategic nuclear ballistic
missile force would pose a credible direct threat against the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the United States nor the P.R.C. has a national
ballistic missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   In the near term, a P.R.C. deployment of mobile thermonuclear
weapons, or neutron bombs, based on stolen U.S. design information,
could have a significant effect on the regional balance of power,
particularly with respect to Taiwan. P.R.C. deployments of advanced
nuclear weapons based on stolen U.S. design information would pose
greater risks to U.S. troops and interests in Asia and the Pacific.
In addition, the P.R.C.'s theft of information on our most modern
nuclear weapons designs enables the P.R.C. to deploy modern forces
much sooner than would otherwise be possible.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the l990's, the P.R.C. had only one or two
silo-based ICBM's capable of attacking the United States. Since
then, the P.R.C. has deployed up to two dozen additional silo-based
ICBM's capable of attacking the United States, has upgraded its
silo-based missiles and has continued development of three mobile
ICBM systems and associated modern thermonuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
   If the P.R.C. is successful in developing modern nuclear forces,
as seems likely, and chooses to deploy them in sufficient numbers,
then the long-term balance of nuclear forces with the United States
could be adversely affected.
</P>
<P>
   C. Despite repeated P.R.C. thefts of the most sophisticated U.S.
nuclear weapons technology, security at our national nuclear
weapons laboratories does not meet even minimal standards.
</P>
<P>
   The P.R.C. stole design information on the United States' most
advanced thermonuclear weapons as a result of a sustained espionage
effort targeted at the United States' nuclear weapons facilities,
including our national weapons laboratories. The successful
penetration by the P.R.C. of our nuclear weapons laboratories has
taken place over the last several decades, and almost certainly
continues to the present.
</P>
<P>
   More specifically, the Select Committee has concluded that the
successful penetration of our National Laboratories by the P.R.C.
began as early as the late 1970's; the P.R.C. had penetrated the
laboratories throughout the 1980's and 1990's, and our laboratories
almost certainly remain penetrated by the P.R.C. today.
</P>
<P>
   Our national weapons laboratories are responsible for, among
other things, the design of thermonuclear warheads for our
ballistic missiles. The information at our national weapons
laboratories about our thermonuclear warheads is supposed to be
among our nation's most closely guarded secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Counterintelligence programs at the national weapons
laboratories today fail to meet even minimal standards. Repeated
efforts since the early 1980's have failed to solve the
counterintelligence deficiencies at the National Laboratories.
While one of the laboratories has adopted better
counterintelligence practices than the others, all remain
inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the United States discovered in 1995 that the P.R.C.
had stolen design information on the W-88 Trident D-5 warhead and
technical information on a number of other U.S. thermonuclear
warheads, the White House has informed the Select Committee, in
response to specific interrogatories propounded by the Committee,
that the President was not briefed about the counterintelligence
failures until early 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, given the great significance of the P.R.C. thefts, the
Select Committee is concerned that the appropriate committees of
the Congress were not adequately briefed on the extent of the
P.R.C.'s espionage efforts.
</P>
<P>
   A counterintelligence and security plan adopted by the
Department of Energy in late 1998 in response to Presidential
Decision Directive 61 is a step toward establishing sound
counterintelligence practices. However, according to the head of
these efforts, significant time will be required to implement
improved security procedures pursuant to the directive. Security at
the national weapons laboratories will not be satisfactory until at
least sometime in the year 2000. . . .
</P>
<P>
   2. The P.R.C. has stolen or otherwise illegally obtained U.S.
missile and space technology that improves the P.R.C.'s military
and intelligence capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   A. The P.R.C. has stolen U.S. missile technology and exploited
it for the P.R.C.'s own ballistic missile applications.
</P>
<P>
   The P.R.C. has proliferated such military technology to a number
of other countries, including regimes hostile to the United States.
The Select Committee has found that the P.R.C. has stolen a
specific U.S. guidance technology used on current and past
generations of U.S. weapons systems. The stolen guidance technology
is currently used on a variety of U.S. missiles and military
aircraft, including:
</P>
<P>
   _ The U.S. Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS)
</P>
<P>
   _ The U.S. Navy Stand-Off Land Attack Missile-Extended Range
(SLAM-ER)
</P>
<P>
   _ The U.S. Navy F-14
</P>
<P>
   _ The U.S. Air Force F-15, F-16 and F-117 fighter jets.
</P>
<P>
   The stolen guidance technology has direct applicability to the
P.R.C.'s intercontinental, medium- and short-range ballistic
missiles, and its spacelift rockets.

 &HT;    CLINTON PLEDGES TIGHTER NUCLEAR SECURITY, CONTINUED CHINA TIES
 &HT;    With US-CHINA.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, responding to a congressional
report on decades of Chinese spying at American weapons labs,
pledged Tuesday to tighten security but also urged keeping close
ties with China.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress said the report showed the administration
was to blame for reacting slowly to the espionage, and said the
spying could be continuing.
</P>
<P>
   After months of White House damage-control efforts in
anticipation of the House Select Committee report, the president
paused only briefly during a campaign-style event in Edinburg,
Texas, to respond to it. He welcomed most of its recommendations,
even as his aides were quietly discouraging proposals for stringent
new laws to restrict trade with China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like many other countries, China seeks to acquire our
sensitive information and technology,'' the president said, without
acknowledging any specific security losses. ``We have a solemn
obligation to protect such national security information, and we
have to do more to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, whose department oversees the
national weapons laboratories, asserted at a news conference later
that lax security going back to the 1970s has been mostly
corrected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fixing the problem, we're addressing the concerns of the
Congress, and it's important that the American people know that
their nuclear secrets, right at this moment, now, are safe,''
Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite administration efforts to smooth over the controversy,
Republicans in Congress served notice that the issue was far from
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, called on Clinton's
national security adviser, Sandy Berger, to resign for failing to
sound the alarm bell when he first learned of stolen missile
warhead technology in April 1996. Berger has told Congress that he
did not brief the president on the problem until the next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sandy Berger has failed in his duty to the administration and
the American people, and I think he ought to accept his
responsibility,'' Armey said.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Jim Kennedy said Tuesday, ``The president
has full confidence in Sandy Berger, and we would take strong
objection to anything to the contrary.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., perhaps the most outspoken critic of the
president in Congress, came close to accusing the Clinton
administration of treasonous inaction after the discoveries of
stolen secrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of responding to this information with swift
counterintelligence action and prompt public disclosure, the White
House has dragged its feet and stonewalled at every available
opportunity,'' Barr said. ``After reading this report, one is left
with the distinct impression that the Clinton administration wanted
China's espionage efforts to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   In more measured comments, Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., the
chairman of the select committee, cast doubts on claims that the
problem has been fixed. After listening to the administration's
response, Cox said on CNN that the Energy Department's top security
official, Edward Curran, had testified earlier this year that the
department would not be spy-proof until next year.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Cox report was approved unanimously by his panel,
members of Congress divided over the severity of the problem. Some
Democrats tried to spread the blame by pointing out that the spying
extended to the Republican administrations of Ronald Reagan and
George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could we have done better? Absolutely,'' said Senate Minority
Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., adding that ``this has been around for
a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic leader said that the Clinton administration, ``in
contrast to Reagan and Bush, chose to do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   That remark drew a rejoinder from Jim Nicholson, chairman of the
Republican National Committee, who noted that the Cox report traced
the espionage to President Jimmy Carter's Democratic administration
during the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had Senator Daschle taken the time to read the Cox Committee
Report, he'd also know that it was the Clinton administration _ not
the Carter, Reagan or Bush administrations _ that was made aware of
this breathtaking program of Communist Chinese espionage,''
Nicholson said, citing the report's finding that the spying was
first discovered and reported internally in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Among Democrats who expressed concerns about the report, Sen.
Max Cleland of Georgia, a member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, called the revelations ``the most serious breach of our
national security in a decade'' and a ``flaw in our national
security operations'' that must be repaired quickly.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton praised the bipartisanship of the Cox committee,
it was far from clear how far the White House would go along on the
remedies.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Kennedy said that the administration
remained committed to pushing for China's stalled membership in the
World Trade Organization, and he added the president would resist
most legislation proposed by the Cox report to tighten restrictions
on exporting high technology to China.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think it's necessary'' to pass new laws, Kennedy said
of plans for tougher regulations the sale of high-performance
computers and satellites. He said that the president had the
authority to tighten security procedures without new mandates from
Congress.

 WASHINGTON: spacelift rockets. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The theft of U.S. ballistic missile-related technology is of
great value to the P.R.C. In addition to ICBM's and military
spacelift rockets, such technology is directly applicable to the
medium- and short-range P.L.A. missiles, such as the CSS-6 (also
known as the M-9), the CSS-X-7 (also known as the M-11) and the
CSS-8 that have been developed for, among other purposes, striking
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   CSS-6 missiles were, for example, fired in the Taiwan Strait and
over Taiwan's main ports in the 1996 crisis and confrontation with
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Select Committee has uncovered instances of the P.R.C.'s use
of this specific stolen U.S. technology that:
</P>
<P>
   _ Enhance the P.R.C.'s military capabilities
</P>
<P>
   _ Jeopardize U.S. national security interests
</P>
<P>
   _ Pose a direct threat to the United States, our friends and
allies, or our forces
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton Administration has determined that particular uses
by the P.R.C. of this stolen U.S. technology cannot be disclosed
publicly without affecting national security.
</P>
<P>
   The P.R.C. has proliferated weapons systems and components to
other countries including Iran, Pakistan, Libya, Syria, and North
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   B. In the late 1990's, the P.R.C. stole or illegally obtained
U.S. developmental and research technology that, if taken to
successful conclusion, could be used to attack U.S. satellites and
submarines.
</P>
<P>
   During the late l990's, U.S. research and development work on
electromagnetic weapons technology has been illegally obtained by
the P.R.C. as a result of successful espionage directed against the
United States. Such technology, once developed, can be used for
space-based weapons to attack satellites and missiles.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the P.R.C. stole classified U.S. developmental research
concerning very sensitive detection techniques that, if
successfully concluded, could be used to threaten U.S. submarines.
</P>
<P>
   C. Currently-deployed P.R.C. ICBM's targeted on the United
States are based in significant part on U.S. technologies illegally
obtained by the P.R.C. in the 1950's.
</P>
<P>
   This illustrates the potential long-term effects of technology
loss. Even in today's rapidly changing technological environment,
technology losses can have long-term adverse effects. Currently
deployed P.R.C. ICBM's targeted on the United States are based on
U.S. and Russian technologies from the 1950's and 1960's.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950's, a U.S. military officer and associated members of
the design team for a U.S. ICBM program (the Titan missile program)
emigrated to the P.R.C. and illegally gave U.S. missile and
missile-related technology to the P.R.C. This information formed
the basis for the up to two dozen P.R.C. CSS-4 ICBM's that are
currently targeted on the United States. All but two of these
missiles have been deployed by the P.R.C. for the first time in
this decade.
</P>
<P>
   D. In the aftermath of three failed satellite launches since
1992, U.S. satellite manufacturers transferred missile design
information and know-how to the P.R.C. without obtaining the
legally required licenses.
</P>
<P>
   This information has improved the reliability of P.R.C. rockets
useful for civilian and military purposes. The illegally
transmitted information is useful for the design and improved
reliability of future P.R.C. ballistic missiles, as well.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. satellite manufacturers analyzed the causes of three P.R.C.
launch failures and recommended improvements to the reliability of
the P.R.C. rockets. These launch failure reviews were conducted
without required Department of State export licenses, and
communicated technical information to the P.R.C. in violation of
the International Traffic in Arms Regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The Select Committee has concluded that the P.R.C. implemented a
number of the recommended improvements to rocket guidance and to
the fairing (or nose cone), which protects a satellite during
launch. These improvements increased the reliability of the P.R.C.
Long March rockets. It is almost certain that the U.S. satellite
manufacturers' recommendations led to improvements in the P.R.C.'s
rockets and that the improvements would not have been considered or
implemented so soon without the U.S. assistance.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible or even likely that, absent the U.S. satellite
manufacturers' interventions on the problems associated with the
defective fairing on the P.R.C.'s Long March 2E rocket and the
defective guidance system on the P.R.C.'s Long March 3B rocket, one
or more other P.R.C. launches would have failed.
</P>
<P>
   The P.R.C. Long March rockets improved by the U.S. technology
assistance are useful for both commercial and military purposes.
The military uses include launching:
</P>
<P>
   _ Military communications and reconnaissance satellites
</P>
<P>
   _ Space-based sensors
</P>
<P>
   _ Space-based weapons, if successfully developed
</P>
<P>
   _ Satellites for modern command and control and sophisticated
intelligence collection

 WASHINGTON: intelligence collection. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Select Committee judges that the P.R.C. military has
important needs in these areas, including notably space-based
communications and reconnaissance capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, design and testing know-how and procedures
communicated during the launch failure reviews could be applied to
the reliability of missiles or rockets generally. U.S.
participants' comments during the failure investigations related to
such matters as missile design, design analysis, testing
procedures, the application of technical know-how to particular
failure analyses.
</P>
<P>
   To the extent any valuable information was transferred to the
P.R.C.'s space program, such information would likely find its way
into the P.R.C.'s ballistic missile program. The ballistic missile
and space launch programs have long been intertwined and
subordinate to the same ministry and state-owned corporation in the
P.R.C.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the P.R.C.'s Long March 2 rockets and their
derivatives (including the Long March 2E, on which Hughes advised
the P.R.C.) were derived directly from the P.R.C.'s silo-based
CSS-4 intercontinental ballistic missiles that are currently
targeted on the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The various institutes and academies in the P.R.C. involved in
ballistic missile and rocket design also share design and
production responsibilities. Many of the P.R.C. personnel in these
organizations have responsibilities for both commercial rocket and
military missile programs. Attendees at important failure review
meetings included P.R.C. personnel from such organizations.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, information passed during each of the failure analyses
has the potential to benefit the P.R.C.'s ballistic missile
program. The independent experts retained by the Select Committee
judge that information valuable to the P.R.C.'s ballistic missile
and space programs was transferred to the P.R.C. in the failure
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   The rocket guidance system on which Loral and Hughes provided
advice in 1996 is judged by the Select Committee to be among the
systems capable of being adapted for use as the guidance system for
future P.R.C. road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles,
although if a better system is available, it is more likely to be
chosen for that mission.
</P>
<P>
   The Select Committee judges that information on rocket fairings
(that is, nose cones) provided to the PRC by Hughes may assist the
design and improved reliability of future P.R.C. MIRV'ed missiles,
if the P.R.C. decides to develop them, and of future
submarine-launched ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   When Loral and Hughes assisted the P.R.C., they could not know
whether the P.R.C. would in fact use such information in their
military programs.
</P>
<P>
   i. In 1993 and 1995, Hughes showed the P.R.C how to improve the
design and reliability of P.R.C. rockets. Hughes' advice may also
be useful for design and improved reliability of future P.R.C.
ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes deliberately acted without seeking to obtain the legally
required licenses.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 and 1995, Hughes showed the P.R.C. how to improve the
design and reliability of P.R.C. Long March rockets with important
military applications. The information provided by Hughes also may
be useful for improving the reliability of future P.R.C. ballistic
missiles. Hughes deliberately acted without the legally required
licenses.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 and 1995 Hughes analyzed the causes of P.R.C. launch
failures and, for both failures, illegally recommended to the
P.R.C. improvements to the fairing, a part of the rocket that
protects the payload. The P.R.C. changed the fairing of its Long
March rocket to incorporate the Hughes recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes also corrected deficiencies in the P.R.C.'s coupled loads
analysis, a critical rocket design technology. Hughes also
identified changes needed in P.R.C. launch operations.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls has
concluded that Hughes significantly improved the P.R.C. space
launch program and contributed to the P.R.C. goal of assured access
to space. The State Department further concluded that the lessons
learned by the P.R.C. are inherently applicable to their missile
program.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department administers arms export licensing, and
would have been the proper authority to license the Hughes failure
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department found that the P.R.C. and Hughes personnel
engaged in an extensive exchange of data and analyses, which, among
other things, identified and corrected for the P.R.C. deficiencies
in a number of technical areas, including anomaly analysis,
accident investigation techniques, telemetry analysis, coupled loan
analysis, hardware design and manufacture, testing, modeling,
simulation, weather analysis.
</P>
<P>
   The illegally transmitted information improved the P.R.C.'s
military rockets and operations. The illegally transmitted
information may assist the P.R.C. in the design and improved
reliability of future silo-based or mobile P.R.C. ballistic
missiles, including particularly missiles that require fairings (or
nose cones). These would include missiles with advanced payloads
(that is, multiple warheads, or certain penetration aids designed
to defeat missile defenses) and submarine launched ballistic
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The P.R.C. has the capability to develop and deploy silo-based
missiles with multiple re-entry vehicles (MIRV's or MRV's). Within
a reasonable period of years that is consistent with the P.R.C.'s
possible deployment of new mobile missiles, the P.R.C. could deploy
multiple warheads on those mobile missiles, as well. The P.R.C.
also appears to have gained practical insight into U.S. coupled
loads analysis, and insight into diagnostic and failure analysis
techniques for identifying the causes of a launch failure. Such
lessons could be applied to both rockets and missiles.
</P>
<P>
   In both 1993 and 1995, Hughes failed to apply for or obtain the
required Department of State licenses for its activities, because
Hughes knew that the Department of State would be unlikely to grant
the license and that the licensing process would in any case be
lengthy.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Hughes also engaged in deliberate efforts to circumvent the
Department of State licensing requirement. To this end, Hughes
sought the approval of a Department of Commerce official for its
1995 activities and claims to have sought the approval of a
Department of Defense monitor for some of its 1993 activities,
although Hughes knew that neither official was legally authorized
to issue the required license.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes had important commercial interests in the P.R.C. at the
time it engaged in the failure investigations. These interests
included future sales of satellites to the P.R.C. or to parties
serving the P.R.C. market, and reducing the cost and improving the
safety of launching satellites in the P.R.C.
</P>
<P>
   ii. In 1996, Loral and Hughes showed the P.R.C. how to improve
the design and reliability of the guidance system used in the
P.R.C.'s newest Long March rocket. Loral's and Hughes' advice may
also be useful for design and improved reliability of elements of
future PRC ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Loral and Hughes acted without the legally required license,
although both corporations knew that a license was required.
</P>
<P>
   Loral and Hughes analyzed for the P.R.C. the potential causes of
a 1996 P.R.C. launch failure, identified for the P.R.C. the true
cause of the failure as a particular element within the Long March
rocket's guidance unit, and provided the P.R.C. with technical
assistance that may be useful not only for the P.R.C.'s commercial
and military space launch programs, but for ballistic missiles as
well. In so doing, Loral and Hughes deliberately acted without the
legally required license, and violated U.S. export control laws.
</P>
<P>
   Although Loral and Hughes were well aware that a State
Department license was required to provide assistance related to
the guidance system of a P.R.C. rocket, neither company applied for
or obtained the required license. Loral was warned of the need for
a license at the time it agreed to participate in the
investigation, but took no action.
</P>
<P>
   Loral and Hughes also failed to properly brief participants in
the failure investigation of U.S. export requirements, failed to
monitor the investigation as it progressed, and failed to take
adequate steps to ensure that no prohibited information was passed
to the P.R.C.
</P>
<P>
   Loral and Hughes submitted lengthy written materials analyzing
the cause of the guidance system failure to the P.R.C. and to other
foreign nationals. In addition, Loral and Hughes engaged in
technical discussions, including discussions about the details and
causes of the guidance system failure, that were almost certainly
recorded by the P.R.C.
</P>
<P>
   While some aspects of these discussions have been identified by
the Select Committee and reviewed by independent experts retained
by the Select Committee, the full range and content of these
discussions remains unknown. The Select Committee was unable to
talk to several important participants in the failure
investigation, and the P.R.C. refused to agree to the Select
Committee's request for interviews. Additional controlled
information may have been received by the P.R.C.
</P>
<P>
   The information and assistance conveyed by Loral and Hughes led
to improvements to the guidance system of the P.R.C.'s Long March
3B rocket. While the launch that failed was commercial, the
information transmitted by Loral and Hughes was useful, as well,
for military space launch purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Loral and Hughes provided valuable additional information that
exposed the P.R.C. to Western diagnostic processes that could lead
to improvements in the reliability of all P.R.C. ballistic
missiles. Loral's and Hughes' advice could help reinforce or add
vigor to the P.R.C.'s adherence to good design and test practices,
which could be transferred to the ballistic missile program. The
exposure to U.S. diagnostic and test processes outlined by Loral
and Hughes has the potential to improve P.R.C. pre- and post-flight
failure analysis for the ballistic missile program.
</P>
<P>
   The technology transferred by Loral and Hughes thus has the
potential, if used by the P.R.C., to increase the reliability of
future P.R.C. ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The independent experts retained by the Select Committee had
access not just to the written report prepared by Loral with input
from Hughes, but also to the comments of participants about
meetings in Beijing. The independent experts conclude that
information valuable to the P.R.C.'s space and ballistic missile
programs was transferred.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Loral nor Hughes disclosed to export control officers of
the U.S. Government their unlicensed activities until after they
were contacted by U.S. Government licensing officials demanding an
explanation for their conduct. The U.S. Government officials became
aware of the improper activities through an article in a widely
read industry publication. This article also came to Loral's
attention prior to Loral's disclosure to the U.S. Government.
</P>
<P>
   Loral and Hughes had important commercial interests in the
P.R.C. when they engaged in the 1996 failure investigation. These
interests included future sales of satellites to the P.R.C. or to
parties serving the P.R.C. market, and reducing the cost and
improving the safety of launching satellites in the P.R.C.
</P>
<P>
   E. In light of the P.R.C.'s aggressive espionage campaign
against U.S. technology, it would be surprising if the P.R.C. has
not exploited security lapses that have occurred in connection with
launches of U.S. satellites in the P.R.C.

 WASHINGTON: the P.R.C.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The original policy permitting U.S. manufactured satellites to
be launched in the P.R.C. envisioned strict compliance with
requirements to prevent unauthorized technology transfers.
</P>
<P>
   These requirements are encompassed in U.S. regulations and
licenses. Pursuant to a bilateral agreement between the United
States and the P.R.C., the requirements include U.S. control over
access to the satellite while it is in the P.R.C. Many of these
requirements imposed on exporters are to be closely monitored by
U.S. Government officials provided by the Defense Department.
</P>
<P>
   The Select Committee has found numerous lapses in the intended
pre-launch technology safeguards. Defense Department monitors have
reported numerous security infractions by exporters. Exporters
often hire private security guards to assist in the performance of
their duties to prevent technology transfers, and these private
guards have also reported security lapses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, it is likely that other security lapses have gone
unreported. In the mid-1990's, three launches and associated
pre-launch activities were not monitored by the Defense Department.
Launches that were monitored have lacked proper staffing.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the P.R.C.'s aggressive efforts to acquire U.S.
technology, it would be surprising if the P.R.C. has not exploited
security lapses while U.S.-built satellites and associated
equipment and documents were in the P.R.C. Prior to launch, the
satellite, associated test equipment and controlled documents are
transported to the P.R.C. and may remain in the P.R.C. for periods
as short as a couple of weeks or as long as two months. The P.R.C.
would likely exploit opportunities to gain information while the
U.S. satellite and associated equipment are in the P.R.C. before
launch.
</P>
<P>
   Unrestricted access to a satellite for as little as two hours
could provide the P.R.C. with valuable, non-public information
about major satellite subsystems, as well as the design and
manufacture of such subsystems. . . .
</P>
<P>
   F. Foreign brokers and underwriters of satellite and space
launch insurance have obtained controlled U.S. space and
missile-related technology outside of the system of export controls
that applies to U.S. satellite manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   While existing laws address such exports, U.S. export control
authorities may not be adequately enforcing these laws in the space
insurance industry context, nor paying sufficient attention to
these practices.
</P>
<P>
   Satellite and space insurance is underwritten by overseas and
multinational organizations to which U.S. technical information is
always passed to assess insurance risks. This is particularly true
where the insurers have particular reasons to be concerned about
launch failures. These insurers have, on occasion, received
controlled U.S. technical information. It is not clear that
manufacturers and purchasers of satellites are transmitting
satellite information to such foreign brokers and underwriters in
compliance with U.S. export control rules and regulations.
</P>
<P>
   As insurance is critical to commercial space launches, the
insurance role cannot be eliminated. Existing laws address exports
to brokers and insurers. The administration of these laws must be
applied to exports of sensitive U.S. technology to the space launch
and satellite insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
   G. The Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act took
important steps to correct deficiencies in the administration of
U.S. export controls on commercial space launches in the P.R.C.
</P>
<P>
   But the aggressive implementation of this law is vital, and
other problems with launches in the P.R.C. that the Act does not
address require immediate attention.
</P>
<P>
   The Fiscal 1999 Department of Defense Authorization Act sought
to increase safeguards on technology transfer during foreign
launches of U.S. satellites. The measures set forth in the Act
include transferring licensing jurisdiction to the Department of
State, and increased support for the Defense Department's efforts
to prevent technology loss.
</P>
<P>
   However, additional measures _ including better training for
Defense Department monitors and improved procedures for hiring
professional security personnel _ will be needed.
</P>
<P>
   H. It is in the national security interest of the United States
to increase U.S. domestic launch capacity.
</P>
<P>
   While U.S. policy since 1988 has permitted launching satellites
in the P.R.C., U.S. national security interests would be advanced
by avoiding the need for foreign launches through increased
domestic launch capability.The Reagan Administration's decision to
permit launches in the P.R.C. was affected by two factors:
insufficient domestic launch options in the aftermath of the
Challenger disaster, and the perception of the P.R.C. as a
strategic balance against the Soviet Union in the context of the
Cold War. These factors are no longer applicable today.
</P>
<P>
   Launching Western satellites has provided the P.R.C. with
additional experience that has improved its space launch
capabilities. Even in the absence of any loss of U.S. technology,
such experience benefits a potential long-run competitor of the
United States. . . .
</P>
<P>
   3. United States and international export control policies and
practices have facilitated the P.R.C's efforts to obtain militarily
useful technology.
</P>
<P>
   A. Recent changes in international and domestic export control
regimes have reduced the ability to control transfers of militarily
useful technology.
</P>
<P>
   i. The dissolution of Cocom in 1994 left the United States
without an effective, multilateral means to control exports of
militarily useful goods and technology. The Wassenaar Arrangement
on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and
Technologies (Wassenaar) leaves international controls over the
transfer of military technologies to national discretion.

NETWORK SELF-CENSORSHIP: MERCIFUL OR SIMPLY MERCENARY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The great thing about ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' is that it
manages to hit close to home without causing, as they say in
NATO-speak, collateral damage. The allegorical account of a
teenager trying to fit in while simultaneously saving the world
from blood-sucking baddies is disarmingly on point, but its
comic-book nature keeps the message benign: It might rattle the
windows, but there's no glass on the floor at the end of the hour.
</P>
<P>
   Still, The WB postponed Tuesday night's season finale of
``Buffy'' because in it a lot of people die when the mayor of
Sunnydale, Calif., morphs into an enormous serpent-monster during
graduation ceremonies at the high school. This causes commencement
to be just the opposite for students, faculty and anyone else who
gets in the way of the mayor's ``ascension'' to world domination.
</P>
<P>
   Network CEO Jamie Kellner said he was delaying the season finale
until this summer ``out of sympathy and compassion for the families
and communities that have been devastated by the recent senseless
acts of violence ... on high school campuses.''
</P>
<P>
   And airing it three months from now _ as another school year is
starting _ would be a more sensitive time? Presumably, the people
most deeply affected by the tragedies at Columbine and other
schools may never again be inclined to watch ``Buffy,'' which
almost always involves violence in and around Sunnydale High
School.
</P>
<P>
   In an episode two weeks ago, Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle
Gellar) was honored at the senior prom for helping Sunnydale's
Class of '99 achieve the lowest mortality rate of any class in the
school's history.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many moments in the irony-rich ``Buffy,'' it was an
amusing one. Sunnydale isn't like most high schools. It sits on a
``hell mouth,'' a portal to the demon world, which makes the chance
of graduation a little dicey. You're in study hall one minute,
fending off a grotesque bringer of death the next. And they don't
even offer extra credit. All the more reason to single out Class
Protector along with Best Dressed and Most Likely To.
</P>
<P>
   But the reference to high school mortality rates, coming just
three weeks after the killings at Columbine, gave one pause. All of
a sudden, the subject of school kids dying in great numbers has
ceased to be the exclusive province of fantasy fiction.
</P>
<P>
   What to do?
</P>
<P>
   This week, The WB did. (It also pulled the April 27 episode, in
which Buffy overheard classmates plotting to kill other students.)
But is it ``sensitivity'' to delay a depiction of violence? Or is
it something else entirely?
</P>
<P>
   Last week, CBS President Les Moonves said he kept a series
titled ``Falcone'' off next fall's prime-time schedule because of
its violent nature. Never mind that it has nothing to do with high
school students. It's about a mob war in New York,  &UR; gfgrave &LR; a la
the film ``Donnie Brasco,'' but Moonves didn't think it was
appropriate for the times. The Associated Press quoted him as
saying: ``We felt a responsibility not to put it on now. It just
didn't feel right.''
</P>
<P>
   A press release had The WB's Kellner saying similar things
Monday. ``Given the curent climate,'' he said, ``depicting acts of
violence at a high school graduation ceremony, even fantasy acts
against 60-foot serpents and vampires, is inappropriate,''
especially at a time when so many kids are graduating.
</P>
<P>
   Forgive my viewing this through a glass cynically, but
``appropriateness'' here seems to be a euphemism for opportunity.
The networks are ruled by ratings and money, and while I believe
Kellner and Moonves to be decent human beings, lower viewership
equals less cash. So it makes good business sense to put on
programs that the masses are likely to watch and, conversely, to
keep off the air programs that people might not be inclined to
watch.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, it's a huge guessing game, which explains the
copycat nature of network programming. (If something is successful,
you can count on seeing several clones of it the following season.)
But sometimes, thanks to a dramatic turn in the course of human
events, the tea leaves are easy to read. Right now, for instance,
they spell out: ``GO EASY ON THE VIOLENCE.''
</P>
<P>
   As a confessed violence weenie, I don't have much of a problem
with that. Even some of the stuff on ``Buffy'' makes me wince,
especially this past season. But is the History Channel being
insensitive in airing ``Weapons at War'' while U.S.-made weapons
are relandscaping Yugoslavia from the air and damaging
flesh-and-blood collateral on the ground? Is it insensitive for NBC
to hype a ``Law &AMP; Order'' episode whose grisly plot is clearly
ripped from a headline on which the ink isn't even dry?
</P>
<P>
   Programmers love to plumb current events for story ideas, and
while there may never be a TV movie of the Columbine massacre, I
wouldn't bet against it. If there is, you can be assured that a
programming executive will say that the timing is ``appropriate''
for something that brings ``healing'' and ``closure'' to the
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   So excuse me if I take the sensitivity of The WB and CBS with a
pound of salt. Their executives may be well-intentioned, but I have
a feeling they also don't like getting e-mail from offended viewers
or, more to the point, angry advertisers.

 WASHINGTON: national discretion.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The dissolution of the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral
Export Controls (Cocom) in March 1994 left the United States
without an effective international mechanism to control the
transfer of important military technologies. Other multilateral
control regimes set guidelines for particular kinds of transfers
(for example, certain transfers related to missiles or weapons of
mass destruction).
</P>
<P>
   In the post-Cocom period, the United States dramatically
liberalized export controls. A new Cocom-like agreement, under
which national exports of certain militarily useful goods and
technologies are subject to international agreement, would enhance
efforts to restrict technology transfers. The United States should
seek to negotiate such a new arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ii. The expiration of the Export Administration Act in 1994 has
left export controls under different legislative authority that,
among other things, carries lesser penalties for export violations
than those that can be imposed under the Act. . . . iii. U.S.
policy changes announced in 1995 that reduced the time available
for national security agencies to consider export licenses need to
be reexamined in light of the volume and complexity of licensing
activities. New procedures and deadlines for processing Commerce
Department export license applications instituted in late 1995
placed national security agencies under significant time pressures.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce officials alone are less likely to have the expertise
for identifying national security implications of exports of
militarily useful technologies. While national security agencies
may be informed of applications, due time is needed for their
consideration. However, the time frame for consideration is not
always sufficient for the Department of Defense to determine
whether a license should be granted, or if conditions should be
imposed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Intelligence Community has sought a role
earlier in the licensing process in order to evaluate the
technology and end user.
</P>
<P>
   B. Dividing the licensing responsibilities for satellites
between the Departments of Commerce and State permitted the loss of
U.S. technology to the P.R.C.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 decision to give Commerce the lead role in satellite
exporting was properly reversed by the Congress. Divided
jurisdiction between Commerce and State over satellite export
licensing has facilitated the loss of U.S. technology to the P.R.C.
</P>
<P>
   While licensing authority regarding rockets has always remained
with the State Department, in 1992 certain aspects of satellite
licensing were transferred to Commerce. For nearly a three-year
period thereafter, Commerce licenses did not require Department of
Defense monitors for launch campaigns. Accordingly, U.S. Government
officials did not monitor several launches and launch campaigns.
Given the P.R.C.'s efforts at technology acquisition, it would be
surprising if the P.R.C. did not attempt to exploit this situation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, a Commerce Department official improperly authorized
the transfer, in the context of a launch failure investigation, of
information regarding rocket design that would almost certainly
have been prevented had the Department of State been consulted.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1996, all remaining authority for commercial
satellite licensing was transferred to Commerce. Legislation passed
by Congress in 1998 eliminated the split jurisdiction and assigned
all licensing of satellite exports to the Department of State.
</P>
<P>
   C. U.S. policies relying on corporate self-policing to prevent
technology loss have not worked.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate self-policing does not sufficiently account for the
risks posed by inherent conflicts of interest, and the lack of
priority placed on security in comparison to other corporate
objectives.
</P>
<P>
   To protect the national security interests of the United States,
the U.S. Government imposes substantial requirements on U.S.
businesses exporting technology to the P.R.C. These can include
obtaining a license, satisfying additional conditions imposed in
the license, paying for U.S. Government monitors, and providing
security guards.
</P>
<P>
   Under current policies, whether U.S. national security is in
fact protected from the loss of export-controlled information thus
depends in large part on the vigilance, good will, and efforts
dedicated by business to comply with lawful requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Corporations may often face inherent conflicts of interest in
complying with U.S. export laws. Corporate interests that may
conflict with restricting exports as required by U.S. law include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Corporate goals to expand overseas markets and to satisfy
current or prospective customers
</P>
<P>
   _ Urgent business priorities that compete for the attention of
corporate management
</P>
<P>
   _ An unwillingness to devote the financial resources necessary
for effective security
</P>
<P>
   Protecting the national security interest simply may not be
related to improving a corporation's ``bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   In cases discussed later in this report, two U.S. satellite
manufacturers, Hughes and Loral, failed to live by the requirements
of U.S. law. The failure of Hughes to obtain legally required
licenses, for example, reflects a deliberate decision to assist the
P.R.C. immediately rather than risk the possibility that a license
application would be delayed or rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Such pressures may be great where important commercial
opportunities or relationships may seem to a corporation to be at
stake. . . .
</P>
<P>
   D. The P.R.C. requires high performance computers (H.P.C.'s) for
the design, modeling, testing and maintenance of advanced nuclear
weapons based on the nuclear weapons design information stolen from
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The United States relaxed restrictions on H.P.C. sales in 1996,
and the United States has no effective way to verify that H.P.C.
purchases reportedly made for commercial purposes are not diverted
to military uses. The Select Committee judges that the P.R.C. has
in fact used H.P.C.'s to perform nuclear weapons applications.

 WASHINGTON: weapons applications.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   P.R.C. research institutes with connections to P.L.A. military
industries have access to numerous U.S.-built H.P.C.'s that could
be used for unlawful military applications. H.P.C.'s are important
for many military applications, and essential for some.
</P>
<P>
   One key concern is diversion of U.S. H.P.C.'s to the P.R.C.'s
nuclear weapons program. If the P.R.C. complies with the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, then its need for H.P.C.'s to
design, weaponize, deploy and maintain nuclear weapons will be
greater than that of any other nation possessing nuclear weapons,
according to the Department of Energy.
</P>
<P>
   H.P.C.'s are useful for two-dimensional and critical to
three-dimensional computer modeling that would be necessary for the
P.R.C. to develop, modify, and maintain its nuclear weapons in the
absence of physical testing.
</P>
<P>
   The utility of nuclear weapons computer modeling depends on the
amount of data available from actual nuclear weapons tests, the
computing capcity that is available, and programmer expertise. For
this reason, in the judgment of the Select Committee, the P.R.C.
has targeted U.S. nuclear test data for espionage collection,
which, if successful, would reduce its H.P.C. performance
requirements. . . .
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Select Committee judges that the P.R.C. has been
using H.P.C.'s for nuclear weapons applications. The illegal
diversion of H.P.C.'s for the benefit of the P.R.C. military is
facilitated by the lack of effective post-sale verifications of the
locations and purposes for which the computers are being used.
H.P.C. diversion for P.R.C. military use is also facilitated by the
steady relaxation of U.S. export controls over sales of H.P.C.'s.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1998, there was no verification of the end uses of
H.P.C.'s in the P.R.C. Modest verification procedures were
announced in June 1998, but even if these are implemented fully,
they will be insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past several years, U.S. export controls on the sale of
H.P.C.'s to the P.R.C. have been steadily relaxed. As a result,
while the P.R.C. had virtually no H.P.C.'s in 1996, the P.R.C. had
over 600 U.S.-origin H.P.C.'s at the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The PRC has demonstrated the capability to assemble an H.P.C.
using U.S.-origin microprocessors. The Select Committee has
concluded, however, that the P.R.C. has virtually no indigenous
high-end computer production capability. Moreover, while the P.R.C.
might attempt to perform some H.P.C. functions by other means,
these computer work-arounds remain difficult and imperfect.
</P>
<P>
   Data from the Commerce Department and Defense Department
indicate that H.P.C.'s from the United States have been obtained by
P.R.C. organizations involved in the research and development of
missiles, satellites, spacecraft, submarines, aircraft, military
systems components, command and control, communications, microwave
and laser sensors.
</P>
<P>
   Given the lack of an effective verification regime, it is
possible that these HPCs have been diverted for military uses. . .
.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Select Committee judges that nuclear testing data
and related computer codes are a target of P.R.C. espionage, and
that the P.R.C.'s nuclear weapons programs would benefit from the
illegal acquisition of such information.
</P>
<P>
   In conjunction with such data and codes, H.P.C.'s can be used to
improve nuclear weapons designs, performance, modeling and nuclear
stockpile maintenance that would otherwise be extremely difficult
or impossible given the restrictions imposed by the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   E. The P.R.C. has attempted to obtain U.S. machine tools and jet
engine technologies through fraud and diversions from commercial
end uses.

MIR TO STAY ALOFT THROUGH FEBRUARY, SAYS RUSSIAN OFFICIAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ Their own deadlines seem to come and go,
and still Russia seems no more definite over what it intends to do
with its more than 13-year-old Mir space station.
</P>
<P>
   A top Russian Space Agency official said Tuesday that Mir will
remain aloft at least through February, though government funding
will cease at the end of August.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Americans were very practical people,'' said Boris
Ostroumov, deputy director general of the Russian Space Agency.
``It simply does not make too much sense to get rid of such a
treasure.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Russians suggested Mir was safe only
through August, though it was hopeful that private funding sources
might come forward with money for another year or two of
operations. The deadline then was April, a date that came and went.
</P>
<P>
   Mir's fate is significant only in that the funds it takes to
keep the outpost flying, as much as $250 million or as little as
$100 million annually by various estimates, is money that is not
available to the cash-strapped Russian government to meet its
obligations to the new international space station. Russian
financial lapses have already produced a 19-month delay in the
launching of the new station's initial crew compartment, the
service module. The United States is hopeful that it can be
launched by late November.
</P>
<P>
   Mir's current crew of cosmonauts Viktor Afanasyev and Sergei
Avdeyev and French researcher Jean-Pierre Haignere is to return to
Earth in August. However, the cosmonauts could be replaced by
another crew, or the Russians could decide to leave Mir unstaffed
until it reaches a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Mir's orbit was boosted sufficiently to keep it flying
until the end of next February without further staffing, Ostroumov
said.
</P>
<P>
   The official was guarded in his comments about Russian prospects
for a private investment that would keep Mir flying. According to
news accounts in that country, Peter Llewellyn, a 51-year-old
British businessman, has agreed to pay the Russians $100 million
for an opportunity to fly to Mir. However, the reports say his
strategy is to raise the funds from others as part of a scheme to
build a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his allegiance to Mir, Ostroumov took pains Tuesday to
echo recent comments by Russian President Boris Yeltsin that his
country will keep its commitments to the new international station.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all understand that we cannot support two programs at the
same time,'' Ostroumov said. ``No matter how badly we could feel
about that, we would have to say good-bye to the Mir station.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever money will be allocated in the future, these funds
will be utilized entirely for the purpose of the international
space station,'' the Russian official said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, forecasters offered a slightly improved forecast for
the launch of the shuttle Discovery at 6:48 a.m. EDT Thursday from
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   There is a slight chance of thunderstorms near the coastal
launch complex.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle's seven-member crew, led by commander Kent Rominger,
plans to dock with the first two components of the new
international station.

REPUBLICAN LEADERS IN HOUSE SHOW READINESS TO CONSIDER GUN
CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republican leaders announced Tuesday that
they would include a broad package of gun-control measures similar
to those passed by the Senate last week in a juvenile crime bill
expected to come to the floor next month.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert signaled his support Tuesday for
one of those proposals in particular: mandatory background checks
on all buyers at gun shows. Hastert suggested that he also favored
some type of legislation, like the sale of child safety devices
with handguns, to keep firearms away from unsupervised children.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more significantly, Hastert predicted that proposals
like these would indeed pass the House, which has traditionally
been more resistant to gun control than the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert's remarks, like those of other Republican leaders
Tuesday, left open the possibility that the provisions the House
votes on could contain details significantly different from those
in the measures approved by the Senate. For example, some of the
leaders prefer a 24-hour waiting period for gun checks, as opposed
to the three days approved by the Senate. But Hastert was more
adamant than ever that a full range of gun-control issues would be
debated on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House will vote trigger locks, background checks at gun
shows and closing the gun purchase loophole,'' Hastert said in a
speech on the House floor. Closing that loophole referred to
Hastert's previously stated support for raising the minimum age for
handgun purchases to 21 from 18, a measure that goes a step further
than the Senate legislation.
</P>
<P>
   But even as House Republicans trumpeted their openness toward
gun control, House Democrats sternly questioned the sincerity of
that attitude in a series of news conferences that underscored the
intense partisan jockeying around the issue. Each party clearly
craves credit for any legislative action on gun control in
Congress, and neither is willing to surrender that prize to the
other.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats complained in particular about Hastert's pledge
to bring gun control to the House floor in the next three to four
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   They insisted on votes this week and plotted a variety of
parliamentary and obstructionist tactics _ none likely to succeed _
to try to force the passage of legislation before the Memorial Day
recess.
</P>
<P>
   Reps. Nita Lowey of New York, Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut and
Steny Hoyer of Maryland appealed to the House Rules Committee
Tuesday night to add several gun-control amendments to an
appropriations bill expected to come to the floor Wednesday. But
the committee's Republican majority denied that request, saying the
amendments were not relevant to the bill.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Explaining Democrats' sense of urgency, Rep. Dick Gephardt of
Missouri, the Democratic minority leader, on Tuesday called gun
violence ``a national crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And we need to treat it that way and move on it that way,''
Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats charged that Republicans were buying time so
that they could soften the provisions passed by the Senate and give
lobbyists with the National Rifle Association a chance to influence
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said they were simply trying to make sure that they
fashioned coherent measures and avoided the confusion that occurred
in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know emotions are running high,'' Hastert said. But, he
added, ``The nation's eyes have turned toward us, looking for
responsible leadership. We must resist the temptation to score
political points.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Hastert first indicated his support for mandatory
background checks for all buyers at gun shows, a measure the Senate
passed, and a raise in the minimum age for all handgun purchases to
21 from 18.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, he seemed to come closer to endorsing a requirement
that child safety devices accompany all handguns sold by licensed
dealers, though his language was a bit vague.
</P>
<P>
   Other House Republican leaders, including Rep. Tom DeLay of
Texas, the majority whip, have signaled support for mandatory
background checks at gun shows in recent days, a gathering drumbeat
for new restrictions that would have been unimaginable a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   More concretely, Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, the Republican
chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and Rep. Bill McCollum
of Florida, the Republican chairman of that panel's crime
subcommittee, announced Tuesday that they were grafting a broad
array of gun-control measures onto a juvenile crime bill in the
committee.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as a week and a half ago, Republicans had insisted
that, for technical reasons, gun control was not ``germane'' to
that bill.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Tuesday morning, Hyde and McCollum said that a revised
version of the bill would include mandatory background checks at
gun shows; a prohibition on gun ownership by anyone who committed a
violent crime as a juvenile; requirements on child safety devices;
a ban on the import of high-capacity ammunition clips, and
tightened restrictions on the possession of assault weapons by
juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   They said those provisions, to be discussed further in a hearing
on Thursday, might contain different details than analogous
measures in the Senate bill. For example, the Senate bill allows
three business days for the completion of background checks at gun
shows; several House Republican leaders favor a 24-hour turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   But Hyde and McCollum also called for new restrictions on
children's ability to purchase rifles and shotguns, a provision not
present in the Senate bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats think they have a hot issue,'' Hyde said,
referring to gun control. ``They think they can put us at a
disadvantage. They can't. It's our issue, too.''

 By JEFF GERTH and JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A long-awaited congressional report that details a
pattern of systematic and successful Chinese espionage against
American nuclear secrets was publicly released Tuesday and drew an
expression of cooperation from President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The contents of the report, which had begun seeping out in
recent days, were unanimously approved by the five Republicans and
four Democrats on the Select Committee on U.S. National Security
and Military/Commercial Concerns with the People's Republic of
China.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at an event in Texas, the president praised the
committee's ``careful and bipartisan'' approach and said his
administration agreed with the `the overwhelming majority'' of the
report's 38 recommendations, which call for strengthening
intelligence, security and export control programs.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the politically sensitive investigation has already
added new strains in relations between the United States and China,
which has denied any espionage. The committee's criticisms of the
Clinton administration's loosened export policies on technology
could also become a campaign issue. The report already drew a call
from House Majority Leader Richard Armey for the resignation of the
president's national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The 909 page, three-volume report concludes that China has
stolen design secrets for all seven nuclear warheads currently
deployed on American missiles, enabling Beijing to leap years ahead
and modernize its nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The ``systematic'' Chinese espionage began 20 years ago and
almost certainly continues today, but it has not immediately
altered the strategic balance between Washington and Beijing,
according to the report. Still, the committee warns that China is
exploiting stolen U.S. design secrets to develop a modernized and
more mobile nuclear capability that could threaten U.S. troops and
allies in the Asian-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the committee's battle to maintain its bipartisan
spirit, at Tuesday's unveiling, one of the Democrats on the panel
questioned a key conclusion of the report, that the thefts had put
China's nuclear weapons design information on a par with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The report contains new details of recent Chinese nuclear
espionage. It also criticizes the export policies of the Clinton
administration and the practices of two American satellite
companies for sometimes subordinating national security to the
``bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   And it offers a new insight into efforts by the Chinese military
to funnel money to a Democratic fund-raiser in 1996. The report
concludes that the money given by a Chinese military officer, Liu
Choa-ying, who met President Clinton at a fund-raiser in 1996,
``was an attempt to better her position in the United States to
acquire computer, missile and satellite technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday's crowded news conference, members of the committee
took pains to maintain a united front, stressing how issues of
national security took priority over partisan rancor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our final report shows Congress can work well together,'' said
Christopher Cox, the California Republican who chaired the panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris Cox and I agreed that nine members could be Americans
first, putting aside partisan considerations,'' said Norm Dicks of
Washington, the ranking Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   However, another Democratic member, Rep. John M. Spratt, Jr., of
South Carolina, questioned the accuracy of the report's alarming
finding that stolen American nuclear secrets had put China's
nuclear weapons design capabilities ``on a par with our own.''
</P>
<P>
   In his Texas remarks, the president also pledged to work with
Congress to protect national security and continue his policy of
engagement with Beijing. Clinton noted recent efforts by the Energy
Department and today Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said ``we are
fixing the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   At its core, the report tells two intertwined stories: China's
``insatiable'' appetite for American technology to upgrade its
military capability and Washington's laxity over sensitive exports
and security at the nation's weapons laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   The committee began its inquiry looking at a narrow subject, the
launching of U.S. commercial satellites on Chinese rockets. But
midway into its inquiry the committee discovered the nuclear
espionage, which became its most serious avenue. In recent weeks,
the report and the leaks of some of the report's discovery of
Chinese nuclear espionage have caused a furor in Congress. In
advance of the report, the White House made a point of emphasizing
that the leaks of nuclear secrets from the weapons laboratories
happened under Republican and Democratic administrations.
</P>
<P>
   The report criticizes loosened controls on exports of sensitive
technologies, a cornerstone of Clinton's trade policies and
commercial diplomacy, but does not pinpoint blame for the two
decades of lax security at the weapons laboratories. But a
principal finding of the committee is that the United States did
not become ``fully aware of the magnitude of the problem'' until
1995.
</P>
<P>
   The committee interviewed some 150 witnesses and reviewed
500,000 pages of documents. But it criticized the cooperation it
received from the Clinton administration and two satellite
manufacturers. Specific complaints in the report include the
failure of some Cabinet departments to turn over some documents or
allow some interviews, a premature tip off by the Central
Intelligence Agency that acted as an ``impediment'' in one area,
and Berger's answer _ which took 40 days _ to a written question
about when Clinton was informed about China's nuclear spying.
</P>
<P>
   Berger originally told the committee that the president was
informed in early 1998. But this month, long after the report was
completed, Berger changed his account and said he briefed Clinton
in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A senior aide to Berger attributed the delay and inaccuracy to
poor staff work and distractions from U.S. bombing of Iraq, which
began a few days before Berger's reply.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The committee relied on Berger's first account, noting that the
president was not briefed until early 1998 ``even though'' the
depth of the problem was first uncovered by intelligence officials
in 1995. The officials then briefed Berger in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Berger is not considering Armey's request that he resign, a
White House aide said. Other Republicans and even some Democrats
have also sharply faulted Attorney General Janet Reno and the
Justice Department's handling of the espionage investigation.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 percent of the report remains classified. The version
made public often uses words such as ``may'' or ``could'' or
``possibly.'' Cox said that is a byproduct of the declassification
process, which kept some details secret in order to protect
intelligence gathering methods and law enforcement investigations
</P>
<P>
   Some of the report's findings and conclusions about China
include the following:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Chinese government has some 3,000 ``front'' companies in
the United States, but U.S. agencies have little knowledge about
their existence or activities. In the 1990s, China stepped up its
use of front companies for espionage.
</P>
<P>
   _ China stole unspecified thermonuclear weapons information,
possibly from a national weapons laboratory, in the mid 1990s. This
is in addition to China's acquisition of design secrets on seven
U.S. nuclear warheads, including the neutron bomb and the W-88, the
most advanced, miniaturized warhead.
</P>
<P>
   _ China has also stolen information relating to American
re-entry vehicles, which shield warheads as they re-enter the
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   _ China illegally obtained ballistic missile guidance technology
which it has subsequently exploited for its own weapons.
</P>
<P>
   _ China illegally obtained U.S. research and development work on
electromagnetic weapons technology related to satellites in the
late 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   _ China's agreement to allow checks on its use of American
exports, announced at the presidential summit in Beijing in 1998,
is ``wholly inadequate'' in general and ``useless'' in the case of
advanced computers.
</P>
<P>
   The report said Washington's policy of allowing corporations to
self police their technology sales, a significant initiative of the
first Clinton administration, has not worked because ``protecting
the national security interest simply may not be related to
improving a corporation's bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   On the subject of aid by U.S. satellite manufacturers for
Chinese scientists the committee found that in 1993, 1995 and 1996
the companies transferred missile design information and know-how
to China without obtaining the legally required licenses. The
information has improved the reliability of China's civilian and
military rockets and is useful for future Chinese ballistic
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   President Reagan first approved the launching of American
commercial satellites on Chinese rockets. The committee found that
his 1988 decision was based on two outdated factors: ``insufficient
domestic launch options in the aftermath of the Challenger
disaster'' and the belief that China ``was a strategic balance
against the Soviet Union in the context of the Cold War.''
</P>
<P>
   The report calls for improving American rocket launching
capabilities, strengthening the monitoring at foreign launch sites
and tightening federal scrutiny of commercial space insurers and
satellite exports.
</P>
<P>
   Buried in the report is a prescient warning. The committee noted
the lack of procedures to detect or prevent the movement of
classified nuclear weapons information to less secure unclassified
computer systems at the weapons laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until last month that the Energy Department, which
owns the labs, took drastic actions to begin to address that issue.
That came days after officials learned that a scientist at Los
Alamos National Laboratory, suspected of spying for China, had
several years earlier downloaded to an unsecure computer system
virtually the entire history of U.S. nuclear weapons testing and
development.

POLICEMAN ADMITS TORTURING ARRESTED HAITIAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK -- Justin Volpe, the police officer whose torture of a
Haitian immigrant shook this city to its racially riven core two
summers ago, stood before a federal judge Tuesday, shaking a bit
himself and wiping the sweat from the brow.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer had stirred a storm on Monday by announcing, three
weeks into his trial, that Volpe _ who had, all along, insisted on
his innocence _ would now plead guilty to his crimes and thus face
the possibility of life in federal prison.
</P>
<P>
   The switch followed an extraordinarily damaging week in which
four of Volpe's colleagues broke down the ``blue wall of silence''
and testified against him.
</P>
<P>
   And so, at 11 Tuesday morning, the burly, once-brash 27-year-old
officer described in his own words what happened in the wee hours
of Aug. 9, 1997, when he arrested Abner Louima during a brawl
outside a Brooklyn nightclub and took him back to the 70th precinct
stationhouse.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of his prepared statement, Volpe, reading quietly,
nervously, taking frequent deep breaths, uttered the key sentence:
``While in the bathroom at the stationhouse, in the presence of
another officer, I sodomized Mr. Louima by placing a stick in his
rectum.''
</P>
<P>
   He also admitted warning Louima, ``If you tell anybody, I'll
find you and I'll kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   When news of this torture broke two years ago, it unleashed
racial tensions pent up in this multi-cultural city for over a
decade. It deeply bruised the image of the city's police department
_ which, at the time, was enjoying the public relations bonanza of
a dramatic reduction in crime. And, to a degree unmatched until
last summer's police scandal _ when four officers fired 41 bullets
at another unarmed black immigrant, Amadou Diallo _ it tarnished
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who had built an international reputation
as a crimefighter.
</P>
<P>
   The details of the bathroom torture _ Volpe shoving a stick up
Louima's rectum, then bashing it against his teeth, while other
officers assisted or stayed mum _ had long been known to everyone
in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   But as Rev. Al Sharpton, who has led many protest marches on
Louima's behalf, said after Tuesday's courtroom hearing, it was ``a
chilling experience to sit and listen to this man, in his own
words, tell the story.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, Volpe pleaded guilty to six felonies, including assault,
conspiracy, violating Louima's civil rights, and obstructing
justice. A conspiracy charge was dropped.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing's end, Volpe, the son of a highly decorated
retired detective, said, ``If I could just let the record reflect,
I'm sorry for hurting my family'' _ but extended no apologies to
Louima.
</P>
<P>
   Then, federal marshals took Volpe to jail, where he will be held
without bail until his formal sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   The most severe of his crimes carries a maximum punishment of
life in prison. His lawyer, Marvyn Kornberg, guessed Tuesday he
would be sentenced to ``probably 30 years or more.''
</P>
<P>
   The US attorney heading the prosecution, Zachary Carter,
emphasized, ``There was no deal'' involved in the guilty plea.
</P>
<P>
   Four other policemen _ who are charged with taking part in, or
covering up, the crime _ remain on trial. The jury, which was not
in the courtroom during Volpe's confession, will resume hearing
evidence against them Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the federal courthouse in Brooklyn Tuesday, Louima's
supporters expressed a mix of exuberance and caution.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton proclaimed, ``Because of this, we get to see what it
looks like for justice to come our way, to some degree.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the civil rights activist said full justice would not
be served until Volpe identifies the other guilty officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you plead guilty to a conspiracy and not name the
co-conspirators?'' Sharpton said. ``We don't want just Volpe. We
want all these policemen to face justice.''
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Volpe said the ``other officer'' in the
bathroom ``saw what was going on'' and ``did nothing to stop it.''
He did not name the officer, but the remark opened up the
possibility that he could be called to elaborate as a witness for
the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Kornberg told reporters his client cannot be compelled to
testify, on Fifth Amendment grounds _ but added that Volpe ``will
obey any subpoena he receives.'' Though the lawyer did not say so,
he can be expected to try to dangle such cooperation in exchange
for a sentence shorter than life.
</P>
<P>
   One of the other officers on trial, Charles Schwarz, 33, is
charged with holding Louima down during Volpe's assault. His
lawyer, Stephen Worth, told reporters outside the courthouse that
Schwarz would maintain his plea of innocence, saying, ``My client
was not in the bathroom.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Worth said he was ``obviously concerned'' about what
the jurors would think when they return to the courtroom and see
that Volpe is no longer sitting at the defendants' table.
</P>
<P>
   US District Court Judge Eugene Nickerson will instruct the
jurors Wednesday on how to regard Volpe's absence.
</P>
<P>
   John Patten, the lawyer for another of the defendants, Sgt.
Michael Bellomo, said he would move for a mistrial, arguing that
the jurors would conclude Volpe had pleaded guilty, which would
prejudice them against not only his own client but all those still
accused.
</P>
<P>
   Bellomo, 37, is charged with covering up Louima's beating and
conspiring in the false arrest of Patrick Antoine, another Haitian
who was arrested _ but not tortured _ along with Louima.
</P>
<P>
   The other policemen still on trial, besides Schwarz and Bellomo,
are Officers Thomas Bruder, 33, and Thomas Wiese, 35, both accused
of violating Louima's civil rights by beating him up in a patrol
car on the way to the stationhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The turning point for Volpe came last week, when four police
officers came forth and testified against him. The case-closers
were Sgt. Kenneth Wernick, who said Volpe had bragged to him about
shoving a stick up Louima's rectum, and Officer Michael Schoer, who
said Volpe had shown him the excrement-smeared stick.
</P>
<P>
   Kornberg declined to cross-examine both officers. The lawyer,
who also represents one of the officers in the Diallo case, told
reporters Tuesday, explaining Volpe's sudden guilty plea, ``There
came a point in time when the evidence became overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   The surprise witnesses have been hailed by many observers,
including Mayor Giuliani, for bravely tearing down the ``blue wall
of silence'' _ the informal code against snitching on a fellow
officer.
</P>
<P>
   However, Ernie Adams, head of the organization 100 Blacks in Law
Enforcement, dismissed this notion Tuesday, saying the witnesses
should have come forward more than two years ago, when the crimes
were committed.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement to the judge, Volpe said he committed his act
because he mistook Louima for a man who had punched him during the
nightclub brawl where the arrest took place. ``I was mad,'' Volpe
explained.
</P>
<P>
   It was later revealed that Louima's cousin had hit Volpe.
Louima, at the time a security officer who had no criminal record,
suffered extensive internal injuries from Volpe's assault and
underwent several surgeries. He has hired Johnnie Cochran to
represent him in a civil suit against the city. Cochran is also
representing Amadou Diallo's family in a similar suit.

ALBANIAN EXILES FILE SUIT ALLEGING WAR CRIMES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., N.Y.)  (Exclusive)  
(jw) 
 By RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two Kosovar Albanians filed a lawsuit Tuesday in a
U.S. District Court charging President Slobodan Milosevic of
Yugoslavia, his wife and senior members of his government with
genocide and other war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In their civil action filed in Boston, the plaintiffs say that
as part of a ``deliberate campaign of `ethnic cleansing' '' the
defendants, including Zeljko Raznjatovic, the paramilitary
commander known as Arkan, violated laws of the United States as
well as international law.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer involved in the case, Paul Williams, said the lawsuit
was intended in part ``to send a message'' to the International
Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, sitting in the Hague,
that it was possible, and relatively easy, to lay out a case
against Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't need all these highly sophisticated intelligence
intercepts,'' said Williams, a former State Department lawyer and
now a professor of law at American University.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from the NATO countries since the bombing began,
the war crimes tribunal has been gathering evidence against
Milosevic and it is widely assumed that it will hand down an
indictment of Milosevic in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department had no comment on the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the plaintiffs, Abram Chayes, said that he did not
expect Milosevic or any of the other defendants to appear to
present their side of the case or answer the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``My expectation is we will get a default judgment,'' Chayes
said. The challenge then would be to find assets belonging to the
defendants to be used to satisfy any monetary award the court might
make.
</P>
<P>
   The legal basis for the lawsuit is found in a law passed more
than 200 years ago, the Alien Tort Claims Act, which was intended
to punish piracy on the high seas.
</P>
<P>
   The act was invoked in 1980 against a foreigner when the family
of a man tortured to death in Paraguay successfully sued a
Paraguayan police inspector.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years there has been a proliferation of similar suits,
among them actions against the Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos
as well as against an Argentine general and an Ethiopian military
commander.
</P>
<P>
   The wartime leader of the Bosnian Serbs, Radovan Karadzic, was
charged with war crimes and genocide in a lawsuit filed in U.S.
District Court in Manhattan in 1993. He initially asked a lawyer to
appear on his behalf to contest the court's jurisdiction but
Karadzic has since declined to participate, and the case is now in
fact-finding stages.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit against Milosevic and the others does not identify
the Kosovar plaintiffs by name, in order to protect their family
members, who are still in the region, from retaliation, their
lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the plaintiffs is described as a 32-year-old Yugoslav
citizen who has been granted political asylum in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit says that on March 27, Serbian policemen wearing
blue uniforms and masks, along with members of the ``White
Tigers,'' the paramilitary unit headed by Arkan, burst into the
family house in the city of Pec, and ordered everyone outside.
</P>
<P>
   They separated the men from the women and then shot the
plaintiff's 30-year old brother, 64-year-old uncle and 22-year-old
cousin on the front lawn, the complaint says.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiff's parents, sister and sister-in-law were forced to
watch, according to the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   The second plaintiff is identified as a man, 47, who fled
Yugoslavia in 1972 and was granted political asylum in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day, in the same village, Serbian policemen and
members of Arkan's paramilitary unit killed the second plaintiff's
79-year-old father, the lawsuit says.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiff's mother recognized one of the policemen as a
neighbor, the lawsuit says and she, along with her other sons and a
daughter-in-law were forced to flee to Albania. The family's home
and motel, built near hot springs, were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants include the foreign minister, the minister of
information, a former Yugoslav diplomat in Washington who is now
spokesman for the foreign ministry, the chief of staff of the
Yugoslav army and several military and police commanders.

FEMINISM'S UNLIKELY HEROINE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 30) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Auditioning for a soap commercial, the aspiring actress Ann
Marie, played by Marlo Thomas, is told by an executive that she has
the look of ``every mother's child.'' That's enough to wipe the
well-scrubbed, firmly fixed smile off the face of a young woman
trying her hardest to be anything but.
</P>
<P>
   What, she wonders to herself, happened to sex appeal? Sex, it
seems, is the last thing the man wants associated with his product,
though later he forces his attentions on her after inviting himself
into her apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Ann was forever enmeshed in that kind of situation in ``That
Girl,'' the ABC comedy that from 1966 to 1971 ever so judiciously
entertained the notion that an unattached woman in her 20s might
have the urge and the right to lead a life of her own.
</P>
<P>
   As is apparent in nine episodes of the show now on video from
Anchor Bay, those were deep waters in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   ``If women were single, they were `Our Miss Brooks,''' Ms.
Thomas said the other day, referring to the 1950s series in which
Eve Arden played a wisecracking high school English teacher (who
rented a room in an elderly woman's house, rather than really
living on her own). ``That Girl'' was Ms. Thomas's idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to do a show about a young woman who lived in her own
apartment, trying to make it, not divorced from her family, but
who, like most young girls at that time and today, still was
related to her parents but not programmed by them.''
</P>
<P>
   As reasonable as that sounds, this was a show that truly had to
watch its step. ``The networks were terrified of it,'' Ms. Thomas
said. Eventually ABC bought the idea, but, she added, ``they wanted
Ann to be the daughter of someone or the secretary of someone,
ideas I didn't like.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Isn't there a show where I can just be the somebody,
not an offshoot of the other person?'''
</P>
<P>
   In the series, Ann lives alone in New York and supports herself
with a variety of jobs while trying out for parts that with the
exception of gigs as dancing chickens and the like in commercials
always elude her. In the meantime she tries to stay on loving but
equal footing with men.
</P>
<P>
   Her fretful parents, watching from their suburban lair,
seemingly bear the burden of a nation reluctantly embarked on a
great social experiment. Ann, in fact, is very much someone's
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Marie (Lew Parker), a well-meaning father but a dithering
worrywart, is forever descending on his little girl to monitor her
affairs. Needless to say, Lou is on especially high alert when
Ann's boyfriend, Donald (Ted Bessell, who died at 57 in 1996), is
around and is practically apoplectic anytime Donald is detected
actually alone with Ann in her apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest constraint was sexual,'' Ms. Thomas said. ``I got
away with the feminist view that I didn't want to get married; I
must have said that 27 times on that show. I could have a
boyfriend. I could have him home for dinner. But you couldn't have
any sexual contact. It must never appear that Donald spent the
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Kept on tenterhooks as to just how he was supposed to behave,
Donald stays every inch the cheerful, buttoned-down, fully clothed
paragon. But then this was Ann's show. For all her thoughts of
freedom, though, the leash was short. If she was to be allowed her
little foibles, she could at least stay well dressed, bouncy and
upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Thomas said that for her, some of the show's best moments
were off camera. ``The amazing thing is that the first night we
went on the air we were a huge hit with the public,'' she said.
``We got a phenomenal amount of mail. Every young girl in America
wanted to be `that girl.' They'd write in and say: `I'm 17 and
pregnant and I can't tell my parents. Where do I go?' Married women
in their 20s who were unhappy would say, `Don't marry Donald.'
Women would write and say: `My husband beats me up. Where do I
go?'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Thomas and her assistants tried to help. ``What I kept
finding was that there was nowhere for them to go,'' she said. ``It
totally politicized me as a feminist.'' She met Gloria Steinem and
began traveling the country for the cause.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the show, of course, the real world was exploding in
political and sexual revolt. The Vietnam War worsened; the
Democratic Convention erupted in Chicago; students fell at Kent
State. But on the air, Ann Marie bore up as perkily as ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stuck to the life of a young woman trying to make it on her
own,'' said Ms. Thomas, who is 55 and still acts occasionally in
films. ``We were an Audrey Hepburn movie, not a Jane Fonda movie.''

CHINA TROUBLE: OUT IN THE OPEN AND IN OUR FACES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It has been building, quietly, subtly, for months,
even years, but after Tuesday's congressional report on Chinese
weapons espionage, the conclusion is unavoidable: The United States
is in a full-blown foreign-policy crisis with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The report detailing successful Chinese efforts to steal
nuclear-weapons secrets from US laboratories is an implicit
acknowledgement of the difficult relationship state of ties with
China. But it is more than that. Its release also contributes to
the air of crisis that surrounds an increasingly critical
relationship with a nation emerging, just a decade after the
collapse of the Soviet communist bloc, as America's newest
big-power rival.
</P>
<P>
   The stunning findings that China stole classified information on
every currently deployed thermonuclear warhead in the American
intercontinental ballistic missile arsenal prompted angry denials
from China. But the findings also deepened Beijing's suspicions
about Washington even as the American political establishment
adjusts to the uncomfortable notion that an era it thought over _
when world affairs were governed by great power struggles _ may be
back again.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the House committee that concluded China now possesses
stolen classified information on all of the United States' most
advanced thermonuclear weapons, along with many of the rockets
required to launch them, was one of the most devoutly bipartisan
panels on Capitol Hill. The Republicans and Democrats submitted
their findings with the extra punch of a unanimous vote.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about US relations with China now have spilled over
from the rarefied air of diplomacy into important trade and gritty
domestic political areas.
</P>
<P>
   These frictions affect access to each nation's economic markets.
They endanger China's membership in international trade
organizations. They shape relations between the parties on Capitol
Hill. They sharpen tensions between the Republican Party's
internationalist and isolationist factions.
</P>
<P>
   They also provide ammunition about human rights for both
religious conservatives and traditional liberals. And they could
affect the contours of the next presidential election, especially
the fortunes of Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   During the 44-year tug of the Cold War between Soviet communism
and Western capitalism _ from World War II until the fall of the
Berlin Wall _ the tensions in domestic policy and foreign policy
became inextricably interwoven. The result was a red scare that
imperiled American civil liberties, an arms race that warped the
economies of both the United States and the Soviet Union and a
climate of tension that chilled domestic politics.
</P>
<P>
   Already there are troubling signs that American domestic and
diplomatic interests are again converging, all the while
heightening rather than dampening tensions with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign policy findings in the 700-page report are matched
by domestic-policy worries that China simultaneously sought to
influence the last American presidential election. As China has
sought to bolster its presence in global affairs and to increase
its military firepower, it also has roiled American domestic
affairs by its effort to win trade concessions from the United
States that have incendiary political implications here.
</P>
<P>
   Just Tuesday, the House marked the approaching 10th anniversary
of China's Tiananmen Square crackdown with a 418-0 vote condemning
``ongoing and egregious'' human rights abuses by the Beijing
government. Only last month, American combat jets mistakenly bombed
the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, prompting anti-US riots in the
streets of the Chinese capital and transforming the tensions
between the two nations into a domestic controversy in China as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Though the findings of the committee provided clear evidence
that the security breaches spanned three decades and four
presidencies, the report provided yet another challenge to the
Clinton administration, which has argued for a policy of engagement
with China in the face of skepticism from both the left and right.
That challenge took the form of criticism from leading Republicans
who Tuesday demanded the resignations of Attorney General Janet
Reno, who rejected FBI requests to wiretap one of the prime
suspects in the spy case, and National Security Adviser Samuel R.
``Sandy'' Berger, who has been under fire for failing to act when
he first learned of the allegations in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there were mounting signs Tuesday that the China
espionage scandal could provide a new hurdle for Gore, who is
seeking to succeed President Clinton in next year's election.
Former Red Cross president Elizabeth H. Dole, a potential GOP
candidate, spoke of the ``failure of the Clinton-Gore
administration to deal with'' security lapses at national nuclear
laboratories, while publisher Steve Forbes attacked what he called
``the Clinton-Gore administration's national-security policy of
hear no evil, see no evil and speak no evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Governor George W. Bush, another Republican contender,
said the report ``shines a glaring light on the current
administration's failed policies toward China.'' His father was
vice president and then president during 12 of the years in which
the spying supposedly occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosures about the theft of nuclear weapons secrets are
shocking in their own right. Indeed, they prompt comparisons with
Soviet espionage into the development of the hydrogen bomb at
midcentury, when American scientists were forced to conclude that
in developing the H-bomb for the United States, they also were
developing the weapon for our superpower rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's report found that the stolen US nuclear secrets give
China design information on thermonuclear weapons ``on a par with
our own,'' a conclusion that suggests Americans now or in the
future may be at risk of threats from weapons their own scientists
designed. And though the focus of tensions between the two nations
now is primarily over bruised feelings and sensitive domestic
issues, the real danger in the next century may not be the threat
to China relations but the threat to US national security.

COX REPORT OFTEN INCONSISTENT WITH EXISTING KNOWLEDGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: S.C., Wash., Mass., Calif., Neb.)  (With CHINA-COX-REPORT and related stories) 
(mk) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Cox Committee's report on China's nuclear
espionage ``is alarming,'' Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C., a member of
the committee, said Tuesday. ``But is it accurate?''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not, said Spratt, a senior member of the House National
Security Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone in the government agrees that Chinese spies
stole nuclear secrets from American weapons laboratories. All
concur that security at the labs was lax. But the Cox report's
conclusions _ classified and unclassified _ do not all dovetail
with those of the American intelligence community.
</P>
<P>
   Did China steal nuclear weapons documents or blueprints from
American weapons laboratories? Maybe, says the Cox report. No one
knows, says the CIA, its sister services, and an outside panel of
experts that reviewed their work.
</P>
<P>
   Will China use stolen American secrets in its next generation of
nuclear weapons? Yes, says the Cox Committee. Maybe, maybe not,
says the intelligence community.
</P>
<P>
   Did China steal secrets about the neutron bomb from a government
weapons lab? Yes, says the Cox report, citing an intelligence
report. No way to tell, the energy secretary, Bill Richardson, said
Tuesday. ``This allegation is based on one piece of intelligence
reporting, and the FBI has been unable to identify a logical
suspect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Cox report's conclusions ``probably would have been
left on the cutting-room floor'' had the committee taken more time
to interview witnesses and listen to opposing points of view,
Spratt said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the contradictions may be nothing more than honest
differences of opinion in the arcana of intelligence, a field where
politics and guesswork have sometimes clouded judgments in past
years.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's ranking Democrat, Norm Dicks of Washington, said
``the conclusions of the report have been written in a worst-case
fashion'' intended to provoke changes at the weapons laboratories
run by the Department of Energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am certain that academics and experts in and out of
government will challenge some of our worst-case conclusions,''
Dicks said. ``It was my intention, with the help of my colleagues,
to add balance to the report. But I wanted foremost to assure that
the DOE labs got the message this time.'' The weapons laboratories'
security practices have been criticized by outside investigators
for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report draws some conclusions in the public version that
go beyond what you can conclude from the classified version,'' said
Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., who said he was familiar with both
versions. ``There is some language that is stronger than the
facts'' in the unclassified version, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, said the select committee's chairman, Rep.
Christopher Cox, R-Calif. The classified conclusions of the report
are even more dire than the unclassified report, which was scrubbed
of secrets during a five-month Clinton administration review, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And another member of the Cox Committee, Rep. Doug Bereuter,
R-Neb., said the report was neither ``worst-case'' nor
``best-case,'' but simply ``information that was brought to our
attention by leaks within the bureaucracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cox report states flatly that China ``may have acquired
detailed documents and blueprints from the U.S. national weapons
laboratories.''
</P>
<P>
   But American intelligence agencies ``do not know specifically
whether weapons blueprints or design documents have been stolen''
by Chinese spies, senior American intelligence officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The Cox report said China ``is likely to continue its work on
advanced thermonuclear weapons based on the stolen U.S. design
information.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Chinese ``may or may not need'' that information; ``it
may or may not be useful for them to proceed with it, given their
tactics,'' a senior intelligence official said.
</P>
<P>
   Cox said Tuesday that, ``Our cities are being held in threat.''
But American intelligence agencies have seen no changes to date in
Chinese nuclear weapons or tactics, which intelligence officials
say call for using nuclear weapons only if another nuclear nation
attacks it.
</P>
<P>
   The Cox report says China stole important data about seven
nuclear warheads. But they may have information only on the nose
cones and the weight-to-yield ratios of four of the seven weapons,
two of which are no longer in the American arsenal, the
intelligence analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   The Cox committee emphasizes espionage as the main source of
China's ill-gotten nuclear knowledge. But assessing which part of
China's nuclear know-how came from espionage is like trying to
unscramble an egg, intelligence officials say: It also came from
scientific conferences and publications, declassified documents,
unauthorized leaks and Chinese expertise.

CHARITABLE GIVING SET RECORD IN '98, REPORT SAYS
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pushed by a healthy economy and the rising stock market,
charitable giving by Americans climbed 11 percent to a record $175
billion last year, according to estimates in a report made public
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The figures represented the third consecutive year of
double-digit growth and strong gains for many charitable
organizations. The only area that showed a decline was arts,
culture and humanities. In contrast, donations to environmental and
wildlife groups and health and human service organizations grew by
20 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people speculate that we're entering the golden age of
philanthropy, and as practitioners, many of us are experiencing
that,'' said Jimmie R. Alford, chairman of the American Association
of Fund-Raising Counsel, whose nonprofit arm, the AAFRC Trust for
Philanthropy, publishes the report, Giving USA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing some unprecedented gifts,'' added Alford, a
fund-raising consultant in Skokie, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the gains, the new figures are sure to stir debate over
how generous Americans really are. Although charitable giving kept
pace with rising incomes last year, it did not come close to
matching the hefty increases in the stock market in 1998, when the
Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very top group could be giving 10 times more than they do
and not impair their wealth at all,'' said Claude Rosenberg, a
former investment adviser in San Francisco who set up the
Newtithing Group, a nonprofit group that encourages people to think
of donations in terms of their wealth, not their income.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals did raise their giving 10 percent last year to $135
billion, according to the 1999 edition of Giving USA. As always,
individuals accounted for most of the giving: 77 percent of the
total in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Bequests added $13.6 billion, an 8 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   Giving by foundations showed the biggest gain last year, rising
23 percent to $17 billion. Foundations are required by law to give
away an amount equal to 5 percent of their assets, although they
can measure their assets over a period of years.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate giving, $9 billion, rose 9 percent, and amounted to 1
percent of corporate pretax income in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   While individual giving rose slightly relative to personal
income last year, reaching 1.9 percent for the first time since
1973, officials of the association acknowledged Tuesday that income
might not be as useful a yardstick as it has been in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Income is almost beside the point when personal wealth has
increased so sharply,'' said Nancy L. Raybin, a fund-raiser in New
York City and chairwoman of the AAFRC Trust for Philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   Paul G. Schervish, director of the Social Welfare Research
Institute at Boston College, called wealthy individuals a sleeping
giant for philanthropy. Schervish said many such people were
planning for future philanthropy through bequests or programs like
Fidelity Investments' Charitable Gifts fund, which lets individuals
create tax-deductible pools of money that function somewhat like
personal foundations.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Raybin said many individuals also contributed directly to
personal foundations last year. Gifts to foundations totaled $17
billion in 1998, a 16 percent increase, much of it from
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Four other areas of giving showed especially large gains:
environmental and wildlife organizations (up 28 percent to $5.3
billion), human services (up 27 percent to $16.1 billion), health
organizations (up 20 percent to $16.9 billion), and public benefit
organizations, including civil rights, public affairs, consumer
protection and scientific development groups (up 30 percent to
$10.9 billion).
</P>
<P>
   The only area of giving that declined was arts, culture and the
humanities, where contributions fell almost 1 percent from the
previous year, to $10.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Religion remained the largest area of giving, with $76.1 billion
in donations last year, up about 5 percent from 1997. But while it
represented half of all giving through much of the 1970s and the
early '80s, by last year it made up only 44 percent of charitable
giving.
</P>
<P>
   Education represented the second largest area of charitable
donations, with $24.6 billion in gifts, an increase of 11 percent
from 1997.

SEAT SALES FOR NEW PATRIOTS STADIUM CONTINUE TO LAG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The NFL is apparently comfortable with the number of
premium seats sold to date for the proposed new New England
Patriots stadium, but people involved in the project said the
facility would have fewer corporate suites than originally
publicized.
</P>
<P>
   Since announcing its premium-seating marketing effort last
month, a group of civic leaders has said the stadium would have
about 100 to 120 luxury boxes, the most expensive class of seating,
generating $15 million in annual revenue. But people close to the
NFL say the stadium in Foxborough, Mass. will probably have 80 to
100 suites, providing $10 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Political operative Paul G. Kirk Jr. had been using the larger
figure as part of the group's sales pitch to local corporations,
whose purchase of premium seating would provide an important source
of funding to cover the costs of the $225 million facility. While
the group succeeded in persuading the Patriots and Beacon Hill
leaders that there is enough support to justify a new Foxborough
home, it apparently overestimated just how many suites would be
realistic.
</P>
<P>
   The original estimate of 6,000 club seats, a less-expensive
seating option, remains, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Team owner Robert Kraft, in Atlanta this week for an NFL owners
conference, has remained quiet on the specifics of his stadium plan
until he can win approval of a separate financing package from the
league. That silence, combined with the fact that legislation
authorizing the state to spend $70 million in infrastructure
improvements around the stadium was just signed on Monday, has
hampered suite sales, the league says.
</P>
<P>
   So far, sources say sales have reached about $6 million, less
than the $7.5 million that Kirk reported on Monday. Kirk could not
be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want panic, but I don't want complacency either,''
said Roger Goodell, the NFL's stadium expert who helped craft the
Foxborough deal. ``We've still got work to do. This is a positive
indication.''
</P>
<P>
   The league recently passed a rule that will help team owners
privately finance up to 50 percent of new football facilities. The
Patriots will be the first team to reap the low-cost benefits of
that mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   Owners are expected to approve the plan in a vote Wednesday.

OLYMPIANS WITH LESSONS TO IMPART  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 30) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Calliope, Euterpe and Erato looked out from the pages of the
morning newspaper not long ago. Daughters of Zeus, goddesses of the
arts, photographically rendered.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe not the three Muses but certainly violinists. Their
particular Zeus has passed on but left behind a patrimony now
called the Avery Fisher Prize. Women, when I was growing up, were
not known for having pockets, but those of Sarah Chang, Pamela
Frank and Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg are now each jingling with
$50,000.
</P>
<P>
   The big news about the prestigious and financially attractive
award is that the present honorees are all female. It has not
happened before. This same-sex recognition serves the sociological
concerns of the music world, though I, for one, can't hear anything
identifiably feminine or masculine in their playing. They just
play, which is, I hope, the reason they won.
</P>
<P>
   Now that our new set of Muses have their credentials, I hope
they will get to work. There are a lot of creative types down here
looking for inspiration. The divisions of labor will not be that of
the ancient Greeks. Calliope's beat was epic verse, Erato's love
poetry. Euterpe watched over music. (Certainly Bach felt her touch
when he was working out those five-voice strettos.) The
Chang-Frank-Salerno-Sonnenberg trio is strictly musical, but each
member is a musician in her own way.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chang will help the needy spirit from a distance. Her gifts
are at a level so removed from the rest of us that all we can do is
feel the appropriate awe and then wonder on the mysteries of
nature. The ancients would certainly have had Ms. Chang emerging
fully formed from some Botticellian scallop shell. She is 18 now
and gives the impression of having learned her scales and arpeggios
in Elysium, Valhalla or some other godly precinct.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Frank seems much closer to the ground. Her parents are
serious pianists and teachers; her wider family is of the art
world. While Ms. Chang elevates the possibilities of her instrument
beyond our reach, Ms. Frank moves more easily among us, less a star
violinist, with all the trappings that go with that status, than a
musician who happens to play the violin.
</P>
<P>
   She is busy with chamber music, and as a soloist, she has
curiosity well beyond the marketable violin repertory. Those of us
who think that music ought to come first, and the spectacle of
performing a distant second, take comfort in a Muse like this. She
is only 31, but her head is on straight and pointing in the right
direction.
</P>
<P>
   I hope that the duties of her new position will include pointing
the way for others as well, for that is what a Muse is for. What
about all those young musicians on the Upper West Side of Manhattan
copying Horowitz and Heifetz performances from old recordings and
hoping that they can one day be just as famous?
</P>
<P>
   The occasional corrective touch from an invisible hand might
help convince a lot of misguided talent among the young that music
is more than stars and personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Salerno-Sonnenberg will be the most ambivalent of our Muses.
Critics love to hate her; listeners love to love her. She is indeed
Ms. Frank held up to a mirror and rendered in reverse. Part of me
hopes that Ms. Salerno-Sonnenberg will not do too much Musing.
Given the shrill competitiveness of the music business, there is
enough look-at-me musicianship to go around without inspiring any
more.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Salerno-Sonnenberg does send out a salutary message to
people like myself, critics who have long deplored the histrionic
stage manner and the running damage to composers' wishes. Her
career is thriving, and no one seems to care what we think.
</P>
<P>
   It is a good lesson for any writer who presumes to the status of
taste-maker. Critics record events experienced through personal
lenses. The public can be momentarily swayed or diverted by
published opinion, but eventually the public makes up its own mind.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, Ms. Salerno-Sonnenberg is the perfect Muse
for a number of people I can think of. One of them might be the
young Canadian woman who sent along her compact disk of Mompou's
piano music not long ago. Such scrupulousness, such respect for the
letter of the printed page. Mompou said that he hated bar lines,
and experimented with their elimination. In these performances, the
bar line's steady thump resonates through item after item.
</P>
<P>
   No hot Catalan blood here, no score-scorching surges of emotion,
no sighs, no outbursts. Civility, faithfulness, self-effacement _
all the qualities that serve Ms. Frank so well _ fall totally flat
in this recording. Evidently the Muses' work is not as clear-cut as
we thought.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe another look at that photograph will help. Are those three
distinct people looking out at us, or are they Siamese triplets:
individual personalities rendered indivisible? It just might be
that all musicians need all these Muses in different dosages all
the time: a dab of unearthliness, a bit of serious study and the
occasional fling as well. The questions are as ever: how much,
when?
</P>
<P>
   That is, indeed, the puzzle of musical performance. We
pontificate about immutable values, but one piece of music will
need more Calliope and less Euterpe, and another not. Erato can
appear absolutely vulgar in one pose and just right in another. To
inspire us, our Muses are going to have to be kept busy
simultaneously: the joint effort as three-way argument. Expect some
unruliness, but there is always Zeus to come down and straighten
things out.

 &HT;    Republicans promise vote on gun legislation by June
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Conceding the imperative for gun control
legislation following school violence in Colorado and Georgia,
House Republican leaders on Tuesday embraced the broad outline of
new gun restrictions adopted by the Senate last week and pledged to
vote on them by mid-June.
</P>
<P>
   But the GOP leaders left themselves room to soften some of the
more restrictive provisions of the Senate bill, such as the one
allowing law enforcement officers 72 hours to conduct criminal
background checks at gun shows. They also said they would not allow
Democrats to ``stampede'' them into action this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate gun control legislation, part of a $1 billion
overhaul of the juvenile justice system, would require that trigger
locks or lock boxes be sold with all handguns, subject gun buyers
at gun shows to criminal background checks and ban importing large
ammunition clips.
</P>
<P>
   ``We support common-sense legislation that keeps guns out of the
hands of unsupervised children,'' said House Speaker Dennis Hastert
(R-Ill.). ``But it does not require us to rush to judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, meanwhile, accused the GOP leadership of seeking to
delay passage of the measures until after the upcoming Memorial Day
recess in order to give opponents, principally the National Rifle
Association, time to kill it. They vowed to engage in parliamentary
ploys and delaying tactics on the House floor this week until GOP
leaders brought the gun control legislation to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican leadership has decided to be a tool of the NRA
and the gun interests,'' charged Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.).
</P>
<P>
   The skirmishes over the gun proposals were the latest indication
of how politically sensitive the gun debate has become. Only two
weeks ago, Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) and other key
leaders of his committee said they would not permit gun control
legislation to be amended to their juvenile crime bill.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday Hyde proposed doing just that, in exactly the
same way that the Senate used its own juvenile crime bill to become
a one-stop shop for new gun control legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The juvenile justice bill is very important and we did not
want to weigh it down with too much controversy,'' explained Hyde.
``But because of the tempo of events and the incidents in Colorado
and Georgia, we see no real obstacle to combining the two.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also yielded to political necessity. In a closed
meeting Tuesday morning, they reached consensus that they would not
make a concerted effort to amend the juvenile justice bill with
additional gun control measures proposed by President Clinton, such
as limiting handgun purchases to one a month and re-instating the
three-day waiting period for any handgun purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats concluded that pushing those measures might jeopardize
their chances for regaining the majority in the House in the 2000
elections. Many Democrats, particularly in rural districts, blame
their votes on the Brady bill in 1993 and the assault weapons ban
in 1994 for record losses in the 1994 elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are perhaps 12 seats where this is an issue,'' said Rep.
Jim Moran (D-Va.). ``The leadership wants to do what is right, but
there is also concern about winning back the majority.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to backing trigger locks on hand guns and banning
large ammo clips, the House GOP juvenile bill would also ban
juveniles from purchasing rifles and shot guns from unregistered
gun dealers and require criminal background checks for anyone
seeking to buy explosives. Clinton proposed the explosives waiting
period in his crime package.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert and other GOP leaders also favor ``instant'' background
checks at gun shows, as opposed to the 72 hour time period allowed
by the Senate bill. Democratic sponsors of the provision say it's a
critical feature because most gun shows occur on the weekend, when
access to criminal records is limited. The NRA opposes the longer
waiting period for gun shows.

NATO UPS SIZE OF POTENTIAL KOSOVO MONITORING FORCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As US officials admitted an economic embargo
against Yugoslavia was beginning to crack, top NATO leaders united
Tuesday to approve a large increase in the number of ground forces
that would protect Kosovo after the war.
</P>
<P>
   The new NATO plan, approved by the North Atlantic Council,
called for a 50,000-member peacekeeping force _ nearly double the
size of the force NATO military leaders imagined necessary before
airstrikes began 10 weeks ago. The United States would supply about
7,000-8,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``This force ... will speak softly, by which I mean that it will
be friendly to everybody,'' NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said. ``But
it will have very sharp teeth _ as well as very big teeth _ if
anybody should try to oppose it carrying out its mandate or to
threaten its personnel.''
</P>
<P>
   But the decision did not address the controversial issue of
combat troops, and remained contingent upon a peace plan that
seemed increasingly elusive Tuesday amid reports that some nations
are secretly supplying fuel to Yugoslavia in defiance of a
voluntary international embargo.
</P>
<P>
   US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said it was ``evident
that there is a shortage of oil, and that it is affecting the
ability of the military machine to move forward,'' thanks to
successful bombing raids of Yugoslav petroleum storage areas and a
decrease in shipments through the neighboring province of
Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned, however, by what we've been hearing more and
more'' about barge traffic up and down the Danube, Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   In other developments Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
   --A UN report detailed ``a significant upsurge'' in sexual
attacks against ethnic Albanian women in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the UN Population Fund sent women's health kits into
Kosovo, including in them the ``morning after'' pill for rape
victims. Tuesday, the agency said its report was the first to
confirm the numerous rumors of rape that have been circulating
since refugees began leaving Kosovo. One psychologist, Dominique
Serrano-Fitamant, said ``any resistance is met with threats of
being burned alive,'' according to the nearly three dozen women she
interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   --As many as 150,000 new refugees were said to be on their way
from Kosovo to Macedonia, where some 22,000 ethnic Albanians have
arrived in the last three days, according to aid workers for the
UN. More than 830,000 of the 2.1 million residents of Kosovo have
fled their homes since NATO airstrikes began on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   --NATO warplanes continued to knock out power supplies in the
Yugoslav capital, bombing a Belgrade power station for the fourth
night in a row. During daytime raids Tuesday, warplanes struck at
television and radio relay stations, according to Yugoslav media.
For the third time, NATO also hit a villa belonging to Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, just west of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   --The International Committee of the Red Cross returned to
Kosovo to reopen the agency's mission, which had closed five days
after airstrikes against Yugoslavia began.
</P>
<P>
   --Humanitarian missions planning to launch airdrops of food and
medicine over Kosovo were told they would not be guaranteed
protection by NATO forces.
</P>
<P>
   A NATO spokesman, Maj. Gen. Walter Jertz, warned the groups from
South Africa and Russia that they must work out a detailed
coordination plan with NATO, whose planes soar over Kosovo as many
as 700 times per day.
</P>
<P>
   --Despite past reluctance by NATO officials to comment on the
numbers of Yugoslav casualties, French Defense Minister Alain
Richard Tuesday put the total number of Serbian military deaths and
injuries at several hundred.
</P>
<P>
   ``One can estimate the number of Serb military killed and
wounded is in the hundreds but I can't say whether it is 150 or
950,'' Richard said at a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, diplomatic activity continued in Moscow and
Washington, as German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer came to the
United States to meet with Albright and US Deputy Secretary of
State Strobe Talbott continued talks in Russia with special envoy
to the Balkans, Viktor Chernomyrdin, and Finnish President Martti
Ahtisaari. Chernomyrdin and Ahtisaari are planning to fly to
Belgrade to see Milosevic Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer, whose country is among the most opposed to sending in
ground troops, appeared at a news briefing with Albright but kept
discussion of division within the NATO alliance at a minimum.
Instead, both focused on what they described as an increasingly
disturbing pattern of smuggling into Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said the Ukraine in particular was believed to be
allowing barges to fill up with fuel oil in its ports before
shooting down the Danube to resupply Serb troops. Cyprus and
possibly Greece were also blamed for allowing smugglers to launder
money used to pay for the fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer highlighted another grim development: explosive
nationalism in Macedonia, which has been severely strained by the
flow of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will have severe consequences for stability in the whole
region, especially in Macedonia,'' Fischer said. ``So I think this
aggressive nationalism, this policy of aggressive nationalism of
Mr. Milosevic, rooted in the '30s, not in the '90s, of European
politics must be stopped and will be stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet the only solid military development Tuesday was that of
the top NATO policy-making body, the North Atlantic Council, which
voted to approve the increase in potential peacekeeping troops.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, NATO officials planned to send 28,000 troops to
Kosovo, following an agreement between the Yugoslav government and
the Kosovo Liberation Army to have been signed last March. Those
peace talks in Rambouillet failed, prompting the NATO airstrikes;
now, due to the explosion of violence in the region, nearly double
the number of peacekeepers will be necessary to secure both sides,
NATO officials said.

REPORT DETAILS ALLEGED N-SPYING BY CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ China has stolen secret information on every
currently deployed warhead in the US ballistic missile arsenal _
and has accumulated details about the neutron bomb, which the
United States has not yet deployed _ according to a congressional
investigation of Chinese espionage.
</P>
<P>
   The three-volume, 700-page report released Tuesday produced
swift and widespread reaction, with Republicans and Democrats
conceding that the allegations were indeed serious, though they
differed over what the long-term consequences would be for
relations between the United States and China.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Christopher Cox, the Republican from California
who headed the House select committee that undertook the
investigation, said the alleged thefts began in the late 1970s,
adding that it is ``exceptionally likely'' that China's spying
``continues to this very day.''
</P>
<P>
   The declassified report detailed what Representative Norman
Dicks, a Washington Democrat on the panel, said was ``no doubt one
of the worst counter-intelligence failures in the nation's
history,'' but the findings were conveyed in a ``worse-case
fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   With US-China relations already frayed by NATO's bombing of the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, the panel's conclusions brought fresh
concerns over such issues as whether China should gain entry into
the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The findings also increased calls among lawmakers, mostly
Republicans, for the resignation of Attorney General Janet Reno and
national security adviser Samuel R. ``Sandy'' Berger. Republicans
accused the administration of being slow to respond to earlier
reports of Chinese espionage. Democrats shot back that Republicans
should also share the blame since they were briefed on the problem
and also failed to act.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials emphasized that since the
report was completed earlier this year steps have been taken to
beef up security at the nation's nuclear laboratories. The report
was not released until Tuesday, and about a third of it remains
classified, including some details about the espionage
investigation at the Los Alamos weapons laboratory in New Mexico
where a scientist was fired in March after being under suspicion of
espionage for more than three years.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, whose agency oversees the
nuclear labs, warned of ``over-sensationalizing'' the report's
findings. ``There is no evidence of a wholesale loss of
information,'' he said. ``Not every allegation is a proven fact.''
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing, the foreign ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao
reiterated the Chinese government's earlier denial of the spying
charge, calling the allegations in the report ``groundless.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhu said the report's authors manufactured the allegations to
poison US-China relations in a ``despicable attempt'' to divert
attention from the May 7 bombing of the Chinese Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, attending an empowerment zone conference in
Texas, said he agreed with the ``overwhelming majority'' of the
committee's recommendations for tightening security at nuclear
labs. He also said he was ``particularly appreciative'' of the way
the bipartisan panel conducted its work.
</P>
<P>
   He said his administration was ``moving aggressively to tighten
security.'' Clinton noted he increased funding for
counter-intelligence in weapons labs to almost $40 million from
$2.6 million through an executive order signed in Feburary, and his
administration has conducted a major overhaul of security at
nuclear labs.
</P>
<P>
   He added that he strongly believes it was in the country's best
interest to continue its relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   But Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana, a ranking Republican on
the Senate Foreign Relations and Intelligence committees, said
Congress and Clinton should recognize that the ``United States may
now be at signficantly greater risk from a Chinese ballistic
missile attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Bob Smith, a New Hampshire Republican who also is a
candidate for president, said the report was devastating.
``Somebody is going to jail over this,'' he said. ``This is not
going to be accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, China ``mounted a widespread effort to
obtain US military technologies by any means _ legal or illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   China's ``insatiable appetite'' for US technology allowed it to
leap ``in a handful of years from 1950s-era strategic nuclear
capabilities'' to a position of having nuclear design information
``on par with our own.''
</P>
<P>
   The stolen information includes classified information on seven
US thermonuclear warheads, the report said. The information was
believed to have been obtained through Chinese espionage activities
that occurred in the 1980s, although the theft was not discovered
until the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Also stolen was classified design information for the ``neutron
bomb,'' which neither the United States, nor any other nation, has
deployed.
</P>
<P>
   The report singled out as particularly damaging the loss of
design material for the W-88, a miniaturized, tapered warhead
believed to be the most sophisticated nuclear weapon the United
States has ever built.
</P>
<P>
   The report also said that two US satellite manufacturers, Loral
Corp. and Hughes Electronics, ignored legal requirements and
allowed China to obtain information critical to its ballistic
missile program.
</P>
<P>
   The committee concluded that China will exploit elements of that
stolen US thermonuclear weapons information in its future design,
including a weapon that could be deployed as early as 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The panel of five Republicans and four Democrats found that most
thefts had occurred at US nuclear weapon labs at Los Alamos,
Lawrence Livermore, Oak Ridge and Sandia.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John F. Kerry said the report would ``make things
rougher'' between the United States and China. ``It has the
potential to have very damaging consequences, and it will depend on
level heads and leadership to avoid allowing us to dig ourselves a
hole here,'' said Kerry, a member of the Foreign Relations and
Senate Select committees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be very careful in how we proceed,'' Kerry
continued. ``China is much too important and the long-term
relationship is much too important to allow short-term politics to
manage this.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Thomas A. Daschle said ``it was too
early'' to determine whether the committee's conclusions would hurt
China's efforts to join the World Trade Organization. ``Clearly
this is not something that has helped us in the effort to move the
trade legislation along,'' he said.

OUTSTANDING TEACHER YOUNGEST TO WIN STATE HONOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOREEN IUDICA VIGUE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Come September, David Lussier's life will change
significantly: Not only will he become a father, he'll spend the
school year spreading good news about education as the
Massachusetts Teacher of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Lussier, 29, a social studies teacher at Andover High School,
was chosen Teacher of the Year by the state Department of Education
from among 375 candidates for his dynamism and outstanding rapport
with students, state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Lussier is the youngest teacher to win the honor, which awards a
teacher a yearlong sabbatical to act as a goodwill ambassador for
education.
</P>
<P>
   A teacher for seven years, Lussier believes all children should
be taught to their strengths _ and all teachers should be
innovative and take risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started off wanting to be a great teacher of history,'' said
Lussier, of Litchfield, N.H. ``But now that I've matured, I would
rather be respected as a great teacher of students.''
</P>
<P>
   State Department of Education Commissioner David P. Driscoll
called Lussier ``dynamic as heck.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a way of motivating kids,'' Driscoll said. ``He's very
conscientious. He does the extra projects, puts in the extra time,
and he's very dedicated. That's what impressed us.''
</P>
<P>
   Lussier's students are equally impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids find his class creative and they are more open and feel
more comfortable to say what they have to say in terms of how they
feel about something,'' said Chris Cordima, 18, a senior who has
Lussier for advanced placement US History.
</P>
<P>
   Lussier was raised in Dracut and earned a bachelor's degree in
history from the University of Massachusetts at Lowell. He received
a master's degree in art and teaching from Boston University in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to become a teacher, Lussier said, ``because I was
always a complete history nerd in high school and I wanted to use
that somehow to make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   He spent his first two years teaching at Quincy High School and
began at Andover High five years ago. His wife is an elementary
school teacher in New Hampshire and they are expecting their first
child in September.
</P>
<P>
   Lussier believes teachers need to go beyond the classroom,
reaching into the community to be leaders and mentors.
</P>
<P>
   His teaching philosophy, he said, begins with the notion that
teaching the student is as vital as teaching the subject. He said
more teachers should reach out to students in different ways,
sparking curiosity with non-traditional teaching methods.
</P>
<P>
   Cordima said that Lussier practices what he preaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``His style is more alternative; it's more discussions and
activities than lectures,'' Cordima said. ``He has made me more
open-minded in terms of seeing the whole issue and digging deeper.
He's shown me everying is not just surface.''
</P>
<P>
   As Teacher of the Year, Lussier will travel to schools statewide
and discuss how best to implement education reform and share
pointers with other educators about giving _ and getting _ the most
from children.
</P>
<P>
   Lussier is most anxious to highlight excellence in schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``As educators, we do have a lot of challenges and a lot of work
ahead of us, but I think it's going to be an exciting future,'' he
said.

DICKS WARNS AGAINST POLITICIZING CHINA REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Saying that there is plenty of blame to go around
for allowing the Chinese to steal U.S. intelligence secrets, Rep.
Norm Dicks Tuesday warned Republicans against making political
mischief with the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Dicks, D-Wash., took particular aim at Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, saying that the presidential aspirant should be careful
because some intelligence losses occurred on his father's watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans need to be very careful, particularly George
W. Bush, whose father was a vice president for eight years and then
president when all this happened,'' Dicks said in an interview.
``People need to be fair here. This started in the late '70s, and
went through the '80s and into the '90s, and there were two Reagan
(administrations) and one Bush administration and they didn't clean
up this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor was one of numerous Republicans who
criticized the Clinton administration's handling of China Tuesday
after the release of a report by a bipartisan special House
committee. The report found that Chinese espionage has led to the
theft of top-secret information about every U.S. nuclear weapon.
China denied the espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Dicks, an expert on intelligence issues, was the top Democrat on
the committee, and along with the other Democrats endorsed its
findings.
</P>
<P>
   The report is likely to cause damage to two causes Dicks cares
about _ the reputation of the Clinton administration and the health
of China-U.S. relations. But Dicks said he believed it was
important to have a unanimous report to make it clear to the
administration and to Congress the importance of following the
committee's recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Dicks, who recently gave up his post as ranking Democrat on the
House Intelligence Committee, called the Chinese espionage ``no
doubt one of the worst counterintelligence failures in the nation's
history.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dicks, who was somewhat taken aback by the media storm that
greeted the report's release, spent Tuesday in a series of
interviews attempting, he said, ``to put it in perspective and keep
the balance.''
</P>
<P>
   He appeared on the News Hour with Jim Lehrer, Crossfire and
Larry King Live, and Wednesday he is to appear on the Today Show
and on C-SPAN's Washington Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Although Dicks praised the Clinton administration's response to
the report, he also acknowledged that he helped force that response
last fall. At that time, Dicks went to see Bill Richardson, the new
energy secretary, and warned him that the House committee was
uncovering a major scandal and that Richardson would be well-served
to follow any recommendations he got to improve his department's
poor counterintelligence operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can rest assured that we're getting this mess cleaned
up, and Congress and the administration are working together,''
Dicks said. ``There are going to be people who want to make
political hay out of this, but I think the American people are
going to be fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Dicks noted that, contrary to the expectations of some
Republicans last year, the committee did not find any impeachable
offenses by President Clinton, nor any concerns about campaign
contributions from China. But he said the Energy Department needs
to ``sanction'' some of its employees who hindered
counterintelligence efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Dicks said he is particularly worried about the report's impact
on U.S.-China relations. Like most elected officials from
Washington state, he is a major booster of the relationship because
of China's importance as a market for the state's exports.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a positive story for U.S.-China relations, and I'm
sure a lot of the people who don't like China are going to seize on
this,'' Dicks said. ``This makes it more difficult in Congress to
make normal trade relations permanent, and to accept China into the
World Trade Organization. It's going to complicate things in the
short term.''
</P>
<P>
   Dicks noted that the report follows an incident last month in
which the U.S. bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. The U.S.
said the bombing was accidental, but China has rejected that
explanation, and Germany has called for a NATO investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a good moment in U.S.-China relations,'' Dicks
said. ``But we need to continue to engage China and trade with
them.''

SEAT SALES FOR NEW PATRIOTS STADIUM CONTINUE TO LAG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The NFL is apparently comfortable with the number of
premium seats sold to date for the proposed new New England
Patriots stadium, but people involved in the project said the
facility would have fewer corporate suites than originally
publicized.
</P>
<P>
   Since announcing its premium-seating marketing effort last
month, a group of civic leaders has said the stadium would have
about 100 to 120 luxury boxes, the most expensive class of seating,
generating $15 million in annual revenue. But people close to the
NFL say the stadium in Foxborough, Mass. will probably have 80 to
100 suites, providing $10 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Political operative Paul G. Kirk Jr. had been using the larger
figure as part of the group's sales pitch to local corporations,
whose purchase of premium seating would provide an important source
of funding to cover the costs of the $225 million facility. While
the group succeeded in persuading the Patriots and Beacon Hill
leaders that there is enough support to justify a new Foxborough
home, it apparently overestimated just how many suites would be
realistic.
</P>
<P>
   The original estimate of 6,000 club seats, a less-expensive
seating option, remains, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Team owner Robert Kraft, in Atlanta this week for an NFL owners
conference, has remained quiet on the specifics of his stadium plan
until he can win approval of a separate financing package from the
league. That silence, combined with the fact that legislation
authorizing the state to spend $70 million in infrastructure
improvements around the stadium was just signed on Monday, has
hampered suite sales, the league says.
</P>
<P>
   So far, sources say sales have reached about $6 million, less
than the $7.5 million that Kirk reported on Monday. Kirk could not
be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want panic, but I don't want complacency either,''
said Roger Goodell, the NFL's stadium expert who helped craft the
Foxborough deal. ``We've still got work to do. This is a positive
indication.''
</P>
<P>
   The league recently passed a rule that will help team owners
privately finance up to 50 percent of new football facilities. The
Patriots will be the first team to reap the low-cost benefits of
that mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   Owners are expected to approve the plan in a vote Wednesday.

IN SOUTH KOREA, LAYOFFS FUEL ENTERPRISE

<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ For nearly two decades, Jang Chang-ik
trudged up the corporate hill, clocking long hours and following
orders from his bosses until he became one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Then last year Jang was freed from the drudgery and became an
entrepreneur. In short, he was fired.
</P>
<P>
   Jang, 45, who had been a senior manager in the accounting
department of an LG Group company, is part of a rippling wave of
Koreans and other Asians who would never have had the nerve to set
off and start their own businesses if life had gone as they had
hoped.
</P>
<P>
   But their countries were battered by the Asian economic crisis,
they lost their jobs and now they are at the vanguard of a new
entrepreneurism in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists say that is just what Asia needs to become more
flexible and boom again. And some of the forced entrepreneurs like
Jang may end up as billionaires. But in the meantime their hopes
and dreams are balanced by their disappointments, bills and
overwhelming uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at a loss,'' said Kim Gwi-seon, 43, Jang's wife,
recalling the days after she had heard about her husband's
dismissal. ``We felt a sense of betrayal.''
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 1, a day after losing his old job, Jang put up his
shingle on a new steel door. He is now chairman, president, chief
executive and chief operating officer of JCI Information
Technology, his new software consulting company.
</P>
<P>
   He has not yet turned a profit, but so far business looks
bright: he has completed one project already and has 13 employees
on a payroll that will soon expand to 20. Jang dreams that his
little company will become the next-generation LG Group _ or at
least a new livelihood for the next couple of decades for him, and
perhaps for his two sons, who are now 11 and 13.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea's giant conglomerates, known as chaebol, have been
the backbone of the country's explosive growth in the last four
decades. Controlling large swaths of the country's economic output,
they employed thousands of people who toiled under authoritarian
bosses, and their muscle upstaged many mini-manufacturers in the
market.
</P>
<P>
   But those chaebol, too, began as merely the ideas of ambitious
men, who were economically broken after the war yet had the
perseverance to build, sometimes on very little education.
</P>
<P>
   Korea already has its share of small shopkeepers. And many of
the newly unemployed will be stepping down the corporate ladder
into enterprises that do not necessarily use their skills. Still,
the layoffs of middle-class white-collar workers, who are more
familiar with cram schools than with construction sites, could help
create a new cluster of smart and nimble companies that will better
enable Korea to compete in the global marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   It is far too soon to say whether the new ventures will succeed,
and for now most of the entrepreneurs have not been nearly able to
replicate the incomes and stability that they had in their old
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea's economy is rebounding this year, but as companies
dismiss workers to slim down operations, unemployment is soaring
and the society is still battling to recover from the Asian
financial crisis that began in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Big chaebol like Samsung Group and LG Group are slowly
restructuring, but not nearly as much as analysts would like.
Indeed, two other chaebol, Hyundai and Daewoo, which got into
trouble partly because they had borrowed too much, have actually
increased their debts. O One result is that many economists predict
that Asia's recovery will come less from the likes of Hyundai than
from people like Jang. While Asia's bankruptcies have gotten most
of the attention, newly formed corporations have outnumbered
bankruptcies for several months, with the ratio rising so far this
year to at least 8 to 1 in South Korea's biggest cities.
</P>
<P>
   Few of the unemployed are as lucky as Jang, who spent years as a
computer programmer early in his career and therefore had readily
marketable skills. And many small-time businessmen are still
struggling, so that although the number of bankruptcies has fallen,
there may be another wave as companies who have survived this far
on their savings begin to run out of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I are constantly talking about how to cope with
the situation,'' said Chon Boon-kee, 38, the owner of two video
houses. ``For two hours every day after midnight, we go back home
and talk about this before we go to bed. If my deficit piles up,
then my money will disappear. I'll lose my shops and become
homeless and empty-handed.''
</P>
<P>
   Chon has tried to sell one of his shops, where students used to
line up before the doors opened to view videos, but no buyers have
stepped forward. He is behind in the rent on both places, and now
he draws far fewer customers than the 30 a day he needs to break
even.  &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is creative energy percolating among the ranks of
unemployed managers.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Kwang-yong, 46, was a traffic planning manager at Asiana
Airlines before he was let go at the end of last year. ``It's been
three months since I lost my job, but I'm still in shock,'' said
Kim, in a dark blue suit as he took a break from a job retraining
class at a college in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   Kim has not yet found a new job. But he figured that whatever he
ended up doing, he would need to know about the Internet, so he
enrolled in an Internet course and now carries around a notebook
that says: ``Forward, march on. Do not tarry.''
</P>
<P>
   He heard about his dismissal only 10 days before it took effect,
and with three children and two elderly parents to provide for, in
addition to his wife, Kim went into a spiritual crisis over his
future. After two weeks of moping around, he decided that he would
not seek another job, but instead start his own business. The
problem was what kind of business.
</P>
<P>
   First he toyed with the idea of selling charcoal that does not
smoke, but after doing a financial evaluation, he dropped the idea
because the costs were too high. Then he considered the restaurant
franchise business, scouring 30 sites throughout the country for
possible locations of a fast-food eatery that would serve chicken,
hamburgers and hot dogs.
</P>
<P>
   He drew up a detailed business plan, writing at his desk until
the wee hours before concluding that he would need about $830,000
for a good site and scratching the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Three more business plans later, Kim decided to throw in the
towel and take the free Internet course. He has not yet settled on
an idea, but he feels more comfortable with his pace, and his
ambitions have not been tempered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to play a big role,'' he said, and then he let slip a
plan, perhaps part vengeful. ``I want to buy Asiana Airlines after
I earn a lot of money from the business.''
</P>
<P>
   But most start-ups are frail, and squeezing out a livelihood
from a tiny venture is very difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Take Kang Chang-hHee, 55, a former shoe factory owner. A few
years ago he had a factory with 13 employees, a big house with a
garden and a wife who was in the business with him. For 17 years
they ran the factory, as well as a shoe store outlet that sold 300
pairs a day.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1990 an employee lighted a match inside the factory near
some chemicals, which exploded and set the building on fire. Three
employees, who suffered third-degree burns, sued and won, virtually
forcing Kang into bankruptcy. He sold everything to pay the
compensation. He began to drink. His wife left him.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992 he pulled himself together and tried to get another shoe
business going, but in November 1997, as the South Korean economy
was tumbling, he had to close his second factory. Exhausted and
broke, Kang tried his hand at odd construction jobs, but those
disappeared as the economy skidded further. A few months later he
ended up at the Seoul railway station, a homeless beggar with no
future.
</P>
<P>
   This winter he began selling baked egg tarts, with the help of a
welfare center that gives him a room and some assistance in
starting a vending business. He went all over town to find a good
location, moving seven times as store clerks shooed him away from
their spots, until finally a shoe store owner let him set up a
stand on the sidewalk near his store.
</P>
<P>
   Now Kang has switched to selling cakes and ice cream. When he
starts earning enough money, he hopes to open a store, remarry and
get back in touch with his five brothers and sisters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a thing to boast about, to stay at a welfare
center,'' he said, ``so when I become more self-sufficient, then I
will contact them. Some people live very smooth lives, but mine was
not.''

 NEW HAMPSHIRE MAKES MARTIN LUTHER KING HOLIDAY UNANIMOUS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ New Hampshire lawmakers Tuesday approved a
permanent holiday honoring the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.,
ending years of such protracted and contrarian resistance that the
long-awaited vote prompted one civil rights advocate to exclaim:
``Free at last, free at last! Thank God almighty, free at last!''
</P>
<P>
   The holiday bill, solidly approved by the New Hampshire House of
Representatives, has already passed the Senate and is sure to be
enthusiastically signed by Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, who pushed for it.
New Hampshire will then become the 50th state to celebrate a Martin
Luther King Day each winter.
</P>
<P>
   While the vote was surely a victory for the state's civil rights
advocates, its tiny black population and the governor, it was also
a triumph for the state's schoolchildren, who for years had marched
on the State House, calling for a holiday named for the slain civil
rights leader they were taught to revere.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last 10 years, this has become a children's crusade,''
said Steve Davis, a school official who has helped organize marches
of hundreds of students.
</P>
<P>
   Some attributed the Legislature's change of heart to a changing
political dynamic in New Hampshire: Its arch-conservative image has
recently shown sign after sign of softening, from a willingness to
consider a state income tax to the Democrats' gaining control of
the state Senate for the first time in more than seven decades.
</P>
<P>
   But other proponents of the holiday said they thought it had
just taken time to combat stubbornness and adherence to tradition
in a flinty state that has only 8,000 black people in a population
of 1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it takes time for good things to happen, and this was
a good thing,'' said Ann White, a retired civil servant who has
lobbied for the holiday for years. ``Especially here in New
Hampshire, it takes time.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after all these years, however, the consensus was still far
from complete. The vote in the House on Tuesday was 212-148, and
several legislators argued against the measure. Their reasons
ranged from contentions that King should not be singled out from
among a constellation of other great civil rights leaders to a
denunciation of ``mindless conformism.''
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Ed Putnam II, R-East Hampstead, turned to House
Speaker Donna Sytek of Salem, and said, ``Madam Speaker, if you and
398 members of the House jump out that window right now, don't look
to the 400th member to jump out behind you because it's `the only
thing to do.'''
</P>
<P>
   And another Republican, state Rep. Donald White of Hudson,
argued, ``If we establish holidays to honor ideals, perhaps we
should not reserve a day for one person.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was the likes of Jane Kelley, a veteran Democratic
legislator from Hampton, who carried the day. Just as King's ``I
have a dream'' speech talked about the day when children would be
judged not by the color of their skin but by the content of their
character, she said: ``So will New Hampshire now be judged by the
content of its character. We must erase the stain of bigotry and
racism from the face of our beautiful state.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, although it has long refused to fall in line with the
other 49 states, New Hampshire has been inching toward a
full-fledged Martin Luther King Day for years.
</P>
<P>
   Congress approved a bill declaring the third Monday in January
to be Martin Luther King Day in 1983, with observance to begin in
1986. New Hampshire lawmakers voted down bills to conform through
the late 1980s, but in 1991 it approved a measure declaring that
day to be Civil Rights Day, though with no mention of King in the
title.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the mid-1990s, New Hampshire governors, first Stephen
Merrill, a Republican, and then Mrs. Shaheen, a Democrat, issued
proclamations each year turning Civil Rights Day into Martin Luther
King Day, but still the House of Representatives balked at
cementing the change. The last time the issue came up, in 1997,
holiday proponents lost by just one vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was certainly an embarrassment,'' said state Rep. James
Splaine, D-Portsmouth, who introduced the first Martin Luther King
Jr. Day bill in 1979. ``It was embarrassing for our governor when
she went elsewhere,'' Splaine added, ``and most importantly,
embarrassing for our kids when they went elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years there has been little concerted opposition to
the idea of a Martin Luther King Day, said Arnie Alpert, a
spokesman for the Martin Luther King Day Committee, which united
the holiday's backers.
</P>
<P>
   At public hearings, Alpert said, only members of the John Birch
Society spoke as a group against it. Otherwise, he said, opponents
were people speaking their own minds _ sometimes recalling charges
that King had been a Communist, complaining that he had undermined
the nation by opposing the Vietnam War so vehemently, or noting
that he had a criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Arthur Hilson, president of the New England chapter of
the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, was among the
spectators in the House when the bill was passed and used the words
inscribed on King's tombstone when he declared, ``Free at last!''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hilson said the issue just ``was never ripe'' before. ``But
there are people who are beginning to see the light that this is
the right thing to do,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Though the fight for the holiday has been prolonged and
grueling, some advocates said the struggle itself had served to
raise awareness about human rights, particularly among young New
Hampshire residents. And in some ways, there could not have been a
better time to honor King's doctrine of nonviolence, said Davis,
the school official.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're bombing for the people of Kosovo and kids are bombing
their schools, and we haven't made the connection yet,'' Davis
added. ``It's about nonviolence.''

NATO PLANES HIT MILOSEVIC COMPOUND, KEY ENGINEERING DEPOT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With allied officials describing the Yugoslav air
defense system as increasingly crippled, NATO planes bombed several
targets overnight, including the villa and compound outside
Belgrade, the capital, that is a headquarters of Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and his leadership, Pentagon and NATO officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO jets also hit the Sabac engineering depot in Serbia, the
equivalent of the Army Corps of Engineers, the Pentagon added.
</P>
<P>
   A one-ton bomb hit the presidential compound at Dobanovci, which
houses a command center for the Yugoslav war effort in Kosovo, and
an underground bunker designed to protect the senior leadership,
said Maj. Gen. Charles Wald of the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   ``A penetrating bomb hit that last night, and we know it was
struck,'' said Wald, who showed a photograph of the strike and a
videotape taken from the plane. ``We're not sure if the capability
has been destroyed. But it was hit exactly where they wanted to hit
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sabac depot has been critical for Yugoslavia's repairing and
replacement of bridges destroyed in more than two months of
bombing. The compound has buildings to store equipment and
construction and repair areas.
</P>
<P>
   Poor weather continued to hamper many missions on Monday and
Tuesday, the allies said, with fighters and bombers hitting 21
targets. Those included Yugoslav troops in Kosovo, airfields in
Serbia, electrical plants and the Internal Affairs Ministry,
according to Pentagon and NATO officials.
</P>
<P>
   Of particular importance, Wald said, was a successful strike
against an early-warning radar in Montenegro that is a crucial part
of Yugoslav air defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to photographic evidence that a NATO fighter had struck
the radar, Wald described the attack on the ``flat-faced radar in
Montenegro one of the most important radars they've had for the
early warning of the aircraft coming and going from the coast.''
</P>
<P>
   As the weather improved throughout the day, NATO planners
scheduled hundreds of sorties over Serbia and its province of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO planes continued bombing through Tuesday evening, hitting
Yugoslav barracks, ammunition depots and Yugoslav forces in the
field, as well as tanks and artillery, a Pentagon official said.
NATO plans also called for attacks on air defenses.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon continued to defend the NATO decision this month to
attack the electricity complexes across Serbia. Since Sunday
evening, sections of Belgrade and other cities have been without
electricity, as well as without water, because electricity powers
the water pumps.
</P>
<P>
   Military and human rights critics have questioned attacking the
electricity plants, saying any military benefit is outweighed by
the disruption to Serbs' daily lives.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon, a spokesman for the Defense Department, Kenneth
Bacon, said NATO was attacking the electrical plants for the reason
that it had bombed Yugoslav fuel supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Modern militaries cannot run for long without oil, gas and
electricity, and this is a way to cut down their ability to operate
and to weaken the military further until Milosevic decides that
he's had enough,'' Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon also disputed contentions that NATO was causing blackouts
in Belgrade and much of the rest of Yugoslavia to create civilian
dissatisfaction and increase pressure on Milosevic to end the war.

FOR FESTIVAL PROWLERS AT CANNES, POUNCING IS ALL  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 30) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANNES, France _ After Heather Locklear, Kate Moss and a French
actress with a tattooed buttock swanned up the red-carpeted steps
to the Palais des Festivals for this year's closing night
ceremonies, the top official accolades at the Cannes International
Film Festival were awarded to two intense, painful French-language
films dealing with hard lives in lonely surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   The Palme d'Or winner, the Belgian film ``Rosetta'' by the
brothers Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne, offers a fierce portrait of
a young woman trying to eke out a living against impossible odds.
It is just the kind of small, profound, beautifully realized film
that will be greatly helped by the prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rosetta'' is as artfully spare as the year's other major
winner, Bruno Dumont's ``L'Humanite,'' is self-consciously
minimalist. Dumont's would-be painterly, philosophical film watches
a wide-eyed police investigator respond to stirrings of evil and
sexuality in a rural town, where the filmmaker regards his
characters as brutish and naked in every sense.
</P>
<P>
   The award of a best actor prize to Emmanuel Schotte of
``L'Humanite'' made for the night's biggest jolt, since Schotte's
halting, fragile manner made the performance look less like acting.
He seemed very like the man he plays.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, this was the year that Harvey Weinstein of Miramax
declared war.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein has long been galled by this event's elitism and its
predilection for dull, irrelevant films and he thinks it's time for
a change. ``There's something wrong with Cannes, and it needs to be
fixed,'' he said angrily by telephone from the closing night party.
``The luster of the festival is completely submerged. It's losing
its place in film history. It has the potential to be so much more
than it is now, the potential to be so much more serious and less
political. I've reached the frustration point, and I'm not scared
to say so any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course Weinstein could be accused of sour grapes. Miramax's
version of Oscar Wilde's ``Ideal Husband'' was this year's closing
night film and Kevin Smith's ``Dogma'' was an out-of-competition
hot potato. (Miramax bought back ``Dogma'' to shield Disney, its
parent company, from possible protests against the film's views on
Catholicism.)
</P>
<P>
   But, otherwise, the usually unstoppable Miramax team was
practically AWOL. Then again, the big American studios were also
missing with the notable exception of Disney, which was attached to
films by David Lynch, Tim Robbins and Spike Lee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a very sentimental attachment to Cannes, but I'm tired
of begging,'' said Weinstein, who had no luck getting ``Dogma''
into the main competition, though there was room for a two and a
half hour soap opera (``Our Happy Lives'') about a group of
star-crossed French characters. ``I'm tired of fighting for obvious
choices.'' (Among Miramax's previous rejects for Cannes' main
competition are ``My Left Foot'' and ``The Crying Game.'')
</P>
<P>
   So he spent much of this year's festival stirring up producers,
directors and financiers of his acquaintance. Maybe they will be
able to offset the doldrums that are especially extreme. When the
Variety critic Todd McCarthy fired off a salvo against overlong
films of no interest to anyone but their creators, his column was
more popular than most of the movies in town.
</P>
<P>
   And if nothing changes? ``Then I won't come,'' Weinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds like a no-prisoners stance, it's also an
indication of what an extreme sport Cannes can be from a business
standpoint. That's what it amounts to for the small club of
distributors who dominate American art-house fare.
</P>
<P>
   The best of what has been seen here will be distributed by
companies including Sony Pictures Classics, which quietly dominated
the festival with its most sure-fire hit, Pedro Almodovar's
graceful and funny ``All About My Mother,'' Chen Kaige's ``Emperor
and the Assassin'' and Takeshi Kitano's ``Kikujiro.''
</P>
<P>
   Newcomers like Artisan had Atom Egoyan's ``Felicia's Journey,''
and ``The Limey'' by Steven Soderbergh, while the newly-formed
amalagam of October, Gramercy and Polygram swooped in to acquire
the big winner, ``Rosetta.'' These companies are all headed by film
buffs who don't care only about the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Showing off isn't what they're here for. Tom Bernard of the Sony
Classics team whizzes around black-tie Cannes on a bicycle. His
partner Michael Barker can go serenely unnoticed in a crowd of
filmmakers desperate to get their work financed.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Ordesky, who says he ``made'' president of Fine Line
Features as if it were a law partnership and at 36 looks as if he
would have trouble buying liquor without a picture ID, favors
hiking boots. On the Riviera. In May. He thinks they bring good
luck because he had them on when Fine Line nabbed ``Shine'' at the
snowy Sundance Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Inside his Cannes survival kit are two kinds of batteries in
baggies _ for the pager and for the cell phone. And there is a
witch hazel wipe. (``What if Elizabeth Hurley wants to have tea
with me and I'm a sweaty mess?'')
</P>
<P>
   He also carries a map and a complete guide to every film here,
right down to where to find the sellers in a flash. And Ordesky is
known both for toting blank movie contracts and having the
wherewithal to sign them. ``It's critical!'' he explains. ``How
many good things are on the acquisitions circuit each year? So if
one comes along and you're not ready _ whose fault is that?''
</P>
<P>
   Even (italics)before(end italics) one comes along. Ordesky
already is counting on a musical for next year being shot with 100
cameras by Lars (``Breaking the Waves'') Von Trier. As Weinstein
demonstrated by throwing down the gauntlet, no need to visit the
casinos if you want to gamble in this town.

   ATLANTA _ With last week's incident at Heritage High School in
Conyers, Ga., the perverse late '90s trend of school shootings
reached metro Atlanta. The local violence followed the Colorado
school massacre by a month. Bo Emerson, Bill Hendrick and Lillian
Kim of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution newspapers interviewed
teachers and principals from around Atlanta, asking how the air of
violence is affecting their schools, their students and their own
lives.

<P>
   I'm not afraid. But, on the other hand, I'm not stupid. We have
really looked at what we would do in that situation. My students
have talked about it, and we have a plan about what we would do,
how we would escape. The fact that we were thinking about it gave
everybody a comfortable feeling.
</P>
<P>
   The positive thing about all this is it has created dialogue
with our students about what's wrong. We have talked about the
outcasts, and this has made the kids more sensitive to those kids.
It's made us more aware of people.
</P>
<P>
   I'm trying to think what my biggest (discipline) problem was 25
years ago. It was probably chewing gum.
</P>
<P>
   It would be interesting for people to spend time with the
principal, to see what kinds of things he deals with. He's spending
his days checking out rumors rather than doing what he's supposed
to be doing as a principal. It's a scary time to be a principal
right now. They're on pins and needles.
</P>
<P>
   The cool thing about being a teacher is you just do your job.
</P>
<P>
   Our kids are not naive enough to think it wouldn't happen at our
school, but I don't think they are thinking about it all the time.
But I don't know. In my wildest dreams, this was not something
anybody ever thought about.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know what the solution is. I think the only solution for
this problem now is summer vacation, getting it out of the news.
I'm an educator. I shouldn't be in news stories.
</P>
<P>
   Kids were getting picked on when I was in school. It's just the
way they deal with it. You're dealing now with a total different
set of variables, and I'll be honest: The teacher now is not just a
teacher. You have to be a counselor, a psychiatrist. I'm not just
teaching quadratic equations. And I think that has to be bad.

</P>
<P>
   I taught from '68 to '91, or 23 years. Studentwise, there's not
a whole lot of difference now.
</P>
<P>
   I'm seeing the same kinds of things among students, basically.
The same kinds of misbehavior. They still try to slip off campus,
they still want to smoke cigarettes when they get an opportunity.
We still have occasional fights. Then as now, every now and then a
student will have a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   You know what I see as the big difference? The parents were more
supportive in the early years when the students misbehaved. Now,
parents are coming in and defending student misbehavior. I think
that's a problem. The parents say those kids were right, and we
know it's wrong.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know why many of us are surprised by what we are seeing,
because the schools are a reflection of what we see in society. We
allow them to see violence and sex on TV, in the movies, and the
child is reacting to what they see around them. Years ago, we
didn't see a person get his head blown off in the movies. We are
getting what we see in society.
</P>
<P>
   Most teachers love teaching. That's why we do it; it's not the
best moneymaking venture you could have.
</P>
<P>
   But you can't find these things happening around you and not
have some apprehension about it. (School violence) could discourage
people from going into teaching.
</P>
<P>
   But if you think about what's happening in other parts of
society, it happens in post offices. A few years back, Dr. (Martin
Luther) King's mother was shot at church, sitting at the organ. To
new teachers, I would say, don't be discouraged. There have been
isolated incidents. If anything, this should give them a keener
awareness of how they should be in education, so we can help our
children.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not going to be paranoid about it. I'm going to approach my
job with the same intensity I always have. I'm going to do much
more proactive thinking than we have in the past, and look at
situations that might happen. I'm going to try to involve parents,
staff and community resources, wherever we see the need to do that.
</P>
<P>
   I would still recommend this field. We've had some tragic
incidents to occur, but there's a silent majority (of students) out
there saying, ``We want you to help us; we need you.'' And we need
to be there for them.

<P>
   Position: Assistant principal, Walton High School, East Cobb
Co., Ga.
</P>
<P>
   What I've had to do here recently is open my eyes wider, be more
visible in the halls, just try to make sure that things are the way
they're supposed to be. In the past, you could hear a rumor and
just say, ``Oh, it's a rumor, they're just kidding. But now you can
no longer do that.''
</P>
<P>
   We're forced to check out any rumor or any story, no matter how
small it might seem. And we have to do it at a greater speed.
</P>
<P>
   So the paperwork on my desk involving students being late to
class or skipping class _ that's taking a back seat in terms of
making sure students are safe. That's been going on for the last
month or so.
</P>
<P>
   We're all saying things like ``this seems like the longest
year.'' We can't wait for it to be over.
</P>
<P>
   I really don't see any general fear on the part of the students.
I personally think the kids seem to bounce back better than the
adults. Something will happen, and then they're just on to the next
thing. Breaks help. Whenever you get a weekend in there and you
come back, you start over.
</P>
<P>
   We've beefed up security measures. Doors are locked. Visitors
are checking in. At the beginning of school, our principal kept
saying we needed to work on a safety plan. He kept stressing that.
And then, after Columbine, we worked on it. We're still working on
it.
</P>
<P>
   What I believe is that we should go for smaller schools. I think
it would be better for the students and the teachers if we had a
smaller setting. The negative consequences might be that we
wouldn't be able to offer the same courses that we offer now. But
there would be advantages in terms of interactions with people.
</P>
<P>
   I'd be crazy if I said it couldn't happen here. I'm not saying
we have the climate for it to happen here. I'm just saying it could
happen anywhere. That's what we've witnessed.

</P>
<P>
   We need to put a summer between us and the events that have
happened recently.
</P>
<P>
   We used to have a water-balloon fight this time each year. (The
students) understand that's not the kind of thing they need to be
doing right now. The last thing they need to be doing is injecting
any kind of chaos on campus.
</P>
<P>
   The reason you teach is because you love kids and you love your
subject matter. If you love kids, you're going to do whatever you
have to do to make them successful, and if that means you've got to
provide some guidance and you've got to set some moral example,
then that's what you do. The only problem is you're always fighting
against a society or a pop culture that's offering lots of bad
examples.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-five percent of the kids who go to school here do the
right thing. They study, they go off to college and become
successful citizens. It's depressing in education that we always
have to deal with the 5 percent. You spend most of your energies on
the 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Both coaching and teaching have been rewarding to me. In
athletics you learn lessons you don't learn in the classroom:
perseverance, dedication, teamwork, loyalty, toughness, all those
coaching cliches. Sometimes I don't think we have an abundance of
these in society anymore.

<P>
   What happened in Columbine gave me the opportunity to have what
I call ``teachable moments.'' Rather than sitting there and giving
all I know about the Cold War, we can talk about Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   I leave it open. I ask, ``Have they had those feelings?'' We
talk about the impact this would have on them as parents.
</P>
<P>
   When I was a junior in high school, (the National Guard
shootings at) Kent State happened 70 miles from my home. It had a
big impression on me. I ask, ``What do you think your kids will
think about Columbine?''
</P>
<P>
   I try to have them draw parallels, and I draw them myself; I
draw them in ways that are more society-centered and less
self-centered. If the subject is civil rights, I try to get them to
be more accepting of people who are different than themselves, to
display tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   There has to be a recognition _ if our country is going to
continue to be successful _ that we all have a responsibility to
teach character. I get that opportunity more than, say, someone who
works in an office and interacts with adults all day. It gives me a
chance to do some character-building that maybe other adults can't.

NATO CLEARS PLAN FOR 50,000 ARMED PEACEKEEPERS IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ NATO on Tuesday approved plans for a heavily
armed peacekeeping force of about 50,000 soldiers for Kosovo, part
of a broad campaign by the alliance's top commander to increase the
political and military pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came as NATO's supreme commander, Gen. Wesley
Clark, began pushing to broaden the bombing strikes in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan cleared by the 19 countries which make up the
alliance, the peacekeeping force would not enter Kosovo until
Serbian troops are withdrawn from the province, either as part of a
formal peace settlement or because of the allies' relentless air
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The plan envisions stationing about 30,000 troops in neighboring
Macedonia, positioning the allies to move swiftly into Kosovo if a
settlement is reached.
</P>
<P>
   But some NATO officials noted that some of the forces could also
play a combat role if the alliance decides to mobilize for a land
attack. NATO officials estimated that an invasion force could
number more than 150,000 soldiers, and would have much more armored
punch than the peackeeping unit, which is likely to include tanks
and helicopters as well as many combat engineers and support
troops.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO spokesmen insist that the alliance is not planning a
ground invasion, Clark indirectly raised the issue during a
closed-door briefing last Friday for NATO delegates.
</P>
<P>
   In a presentation about the overall NATO plan, Clark showed a
slide listing the possible evolution of a military campaign against
Yugoslavia: threat of air strikes, use of air strikes, threat of
ground forces, use of ground forces.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats said the slide seemed to be intended to prod them into
thinking more seriously about the possibility of ground forces, a
matter about which the allied countries remain sharply divided.
</P>
<P>
   It may also have been intended to signal to the diplomats that
they are more likely to confront a politically wrenching decision
on using combat troops later if they do not now give the NATO
commander leeway in conducting the air war.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no discussion of the slide, but it was a bit
striking,'' said an allied diplomat who attended the briefing.
``The subliminal message seemed to be if you don't give me the
freedom to conduct the air war this is what we may face.''
</P>
<P>
   During the Friday presentation, Clark was asked if sending the
peackeeping force to the region could facilitate combat
preparations. He said it could.
</P>
<P>
   NATO Secretary-General Javiar Solana has said that the alliance
plans to bring the war to a close and return ethnic Albanian
refugees to Kosovo before the winter. If NATO's bombing does not
lead the Milosevic regime to accept the allies' terms, NATO
officials will face a decision several weeks from now about whether
to start preparing a ground force powerful enough to seize control
of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The conduct of the air war has been a matter of increasing
debate within the alliance. Following NATO's mistaken bombing of
the Chinese Embassy and a hospital in Belgrade, Italy and the
Netherlands pushed for a broad review of the policy for selecting
bomb targets. Britain, France and the United States rebuffed the
call for a review, underscoring their backing for carrying out
punishing air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Clark has told critics that some civilian casualties are
inevitable in the bombing, despite NATO's extensive precautions. He
has also been pushing to broaden the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   His aim is to focus the attacks on the Milosevic regime and its
supporters, not just on Serbian forces in Kosovo. But some of the
targets he would like to hit are politically sensitive to some NATO
members who insist the alliance should not be perceived as waging
war against the Yugoslav people.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar alluded to approving
Clark's targeting plans after meeting with him Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do share the point of view that the military alliance may
have to have new targets,'' Aznar said. ``New targets may allow us
to continue so that we can achieve a speedy political and
diplomatic solution.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the furious pace of the bombing, some targets have been
off limits. They include factories which produce civilian as well
as military goods that are run by supporters of the Milosevic
regime.
</P>
<P>
   Other sensitive targets include private television studios the
Milosevic regime is using following NATO air strikes on the
government broadcast center.
</P>
<P>
   Broadening the targets could also involve attacks on the
telephone system and command centers located in historic sites. It
may also include attacks on military targets in civilian
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Under current procedures, Clark must consult Solana before
ordering an attack against a politically sensitive target. Solana,
in turn, may consult allied nations.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, the focus of the discussion was NATO's peacekeeping
plans. The allies originally planned to dispatch a peacekeeping
force of 28,000 troops to Kosovo under the terms of the Rambouillet
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   After Belgrade rejected that accord and NATO began air strikes,
allied officials concluded that the force was woefully
insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the force need to be stronger to impose order in
war-torn Kosovo and repel possible Serb threats, it also needs to
carry out new missions. They include clearing mines and helping to
rebuild the province's infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's plan specifically calls for 48,000 troops, but officials
say the force could vary. Not all of the peacekeepers will be sent
to the region before the war is brought to an end.
</P>
<P>
   Solana sent a confidential note to allied delegates explaining
that 30,000 of the troops would be based in Macedonia. Previously,
Macedonia, a poor nation already overwhelmed by ethnic Albanian
refugees, had agreed to allow no more than 16,000 troops; about
14,000 are there now.
</P>
<P>
   Other troops will be sent to Bulgaria, Solana noted. Albania is
also expected to be a staging ground and other countries, including
Hungary, a new NATO member, could be involved.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The alliance's decision on the force was taken under its
``silence'' procedure, which is designed to maximize the chances of
achieving consensus. After a general plan for the force was
circulated, NATO members were given until 5 p.m. Tuesday in
Brussels to object or attach conditions to their support. No
members of the alliance took either step.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean, however, that all of the key details have
been worked out. Many important questions remain, including which
nations will contribute the troops. The United States is expected
to provide about 7,000 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Although some non-NATO nations are being asked to provide
forces, well-armed NATO forces would serve as the ``core'' of the
force, allied officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I call the Teddy Roosevelt force,'' said NATO
spokesman Jamie Shea. ``It is a force that we are designing to
speak softly and carry a big stick.''
</P>
<P>
   Allied delegates also approved arrangements to search ships that
may be carrying fuel to Yugoslavia via the Montenegro port city of
Bar. The search will be limited to nations that have volunteered to
stop sending shipments of oil to Yugoslavia and allow their
registered ships to be inspected.
</P>
<P>
   Some nations, like Malta, that register foreign vessels have not
agreed to participate.

SHUTTLE READY FOR THURSDAY MISSION TO START OUTFITTING SPACE
STATION
</HEADLINE>
   (dal)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ With the first load of supplies for the
international space station packed in its cargo bay, the space
shuttle Discovery is poised for launching on Thursday, NASA's first
human space mission in six months.
</P>
<P>
   Liftoff from Florida's Kennedy Space Center is scheduled for
6:48 a.m. Five Americans, a Canadian and a Russian will embark on a
10-day mission after a string of six launching failures since
August _ the American space industry's worst stretch of ill fortune
since the explosion of the shuttle Challenger and the failure of
four other rockets in an 18-month span beginning in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent record, NASA officials played down concerns
about the astronauts' safety. None of the recent failures involved
rockets of the type that will launch Discovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no additional anxiety,'' said a Kennedy Space Center
spokesman, Bruce Buckingham. ``We feel like we have a good vehicle
on the pad. We're not superstitious at all. We focus on the
hardware, and expect that if we've done our job, the hardware will
do its job.''
</P>
<P>
   David King, director of shuttle operations at the Kennedy Space
Center, said that extra reviews and rehearsals were conducted in
Florida and Texas to maintain skill and proficiency.
</P>
<P>
   The first spacecraft to dock at the fledgling station, Discovery
will be parked for six days while the seven astronauts unload
supplies for the first live-aboard crew, two Russians and an
American, who will arrive early next year.
</P>
<P>
   The station consists of the Russian control module Zarya and the
American connecting hub Unity, which a shuttle crew put together in
Earth orbit late last year. During the visit, two astronauts will
walk in space for a day to mount parts of two construction cranes,
one made in the United States and the other in Russia, to their
respective components.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the crew will also try to repair a Russian power
storage system and an American communication system on the station.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I see it,'' said astronaut Daniel Barry, a computer
scientist and former physician, ``we have a new house. It doesn't
have much furniture or trim yet, and we are bringing up the parts
for both the inside and the outside _ to sort of help finish out
the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry, 45, is scheduled to venture into space with crewmate
Tamara Jernigan, 40, early Sunday, one day after Discovery docks.
</P>
<P>
   Construction and outfitting of the $60 billion station will
require about 160 spacewalks and 86 American and Russian space
flights through 2005 _ including 24 more shuttle trips.
</P>
<P>
   Unloading more than 4,300 pounds of cargo is the Discovery
crew's top priority. The supplies include laptop computers,
cameras, canvas bags full of maintenance tools, and seven 95-gallon
bags of drinking water siphoned from the shuttle's
electricity-generating fuel cells. Water is a byproduct of power
production.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Barry and Jernigan, both civilians, on the crew are Navy
Cmdr. Kent Rominger, the mission commander; Air Force Lt. Col. Rick
Husband, Discovery's pilot; and mission specialists Ellen Ochoa of
NASA, Julie Payette of Canada and Valery Tokarev, a colonel in the
Russian Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   The five men and two women are scheduled to climb aboard
Discovery at 3:30 a.m. on Thursday, about three hours before
liftoff.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle's scheduled launching last week was delayed after a
storm damaged fuel tank insulation.

   USCHINA _ China's two-decade effort to steal U.S. weapons
technology has positioned Beijing to develop modern mobile nuclear
warheads as good as America's, a bipartisan congressional report
said today. An ``insatiable appetite'' for U.S. technology leaves
China ready to leap from a 1950s nuclear weapons program to
sophisticated designs ``on par with our own,'' concludes the
report. The report describes a breadth of Chinese espionage that is
so threatening to U.S. interests that some members of Congress have
compared it to the theft of atomic bomb secrets by the Soviet Union
in the 1940s. The fallout could have a profound impact on the
operation of U.S. weapons labs and on U.S.-Chinese relations. The
House and Senate have called for in-depth hearings on Chinese
espionage and U.S. nuclear security. Richardson within days is
expected to announce disciplinary action against a number of Energy
Department and lab employees in connection with anti-espionage
lapses. (Carr, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   FLA-BISHOP-RESURFACES _ ALMA, Mich. _ Bishop J. Keith Symons,
the former leader of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Palm Beach,
Fla., resigned in disgrace last June after admitting to sexually
abusing five young men as a young priest more than 30 years ago.
The fallen bishop, who had served the five-county diocese of Palm
Beach for nearly eight years, was quickly and quietly whisked out
of town. He left a perfunctory written word of regret to the
220,000 Roman Catholics in the diocese. There had been no hint of
his whereabouts, his spiritual state or his physical well-being for
more than 11 months. Symons just disappeared. Church spokesmen said
he was in a treatment center but wouldn't say where. Last
Wednesday, he surfaced as the leader of a day of prayer dedicated
to the Virgin Mary at the St. Francis Retreat Center in Dewitt,
Mich., about 6 miles north of Lansing, the state capital. Attempts
by The Palm Beach Post to learn more of Symons' status were
unsuccessful. Telephone calls last Thursday from West Palm Beach to
diocesan leaders in Lansing were not returned. Spokesmen had little
to say. The church in Michigan quickly wrapped a protective blanket
of secrecy around Symons. (Gushee, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

 &HT;    907-page report details theft of nuclear secrets by ChinaBy
Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For more than 20 years, China has has stolen secret
information on every nuclear weapon in the United States arsenal,
enabling Beijing to build missiles capable of reaching America,
according to a congressional report published Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Released after a five-month struggle with the White House over
what material to declassify, the 907-report on China's ``aggressive
espionage'' touched off a firestorm on Capitol Hill and will almost
certainly affect the nation's foreign policy with China.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress suggested a range of reactions from tighter
export controls to creating a special Senate committee to review
the House report's findings. Some went as far as to call for the
resignation of National Security Adviser Sandy Berger and Attorney
General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the report issued by a committee headed by Rep.
Christopher Cox (R-Calif.), President Clinton said his
administration is ``moving aggressively to tighten security'' at
the nation's nuclear laboratories and would work with Congress to
implement most of the recommendations of the committee.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton also pledged to continue to work with China on a
host of other issues, including gaining membership in the World
Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   All told, some nine congressional committees are planning to
examine the espionage charges set forth in the report. In a show of
concern about espionage, a Senate Appropriations subcommittee
boosted spending for security and counter intelligence by 40
percent within hours of the report's release.
</P>
<P>
   China denied all wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous,'' said Ci Bin, first secretary at the Chinese
Embassy in Washington D.C. ``He (Cox) gives the impression that
China has stolen so many things. I believe our government did not
steal secrets. The Chinese people just want to be friends with the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, which won unanimous approval from the panel's five
Republicans and four Democrats, says China's next generation of
thermonuclear weapons will ``exploit the elements of stolen U.S.
design information'' and it contends that spying is still going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PRC (People's Republic of China) penetration of our
national weapons laboratories almost certainly continues today,''
Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Norm Dicks (D-Wash.), the panel's ranking Democrat, said
the spying networks at four nuclear laboratories was ``a major
counterintelligence failure, one of the worst failures in the
nation's history.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the security breaches were discovered on President
Clinton's watch, the report documents an effort by the Chinese
government to steal nuclear secrets dating back more than two
decades and two Republican Administrations to the Carter
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The committee found that the focus of the intelligence operation
was at four nuclear laboratories: Los Alamos, Lawrence Livermore,
Oak Ridge and Sandia.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials first became suspicious that spying was taking
place at Los Alamos in 1992 when Notra Trulock, an intelligence
officer at the Department of Energy, detected unusual behavior at
the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, China began a series of nuclear weapons tests
that lasted four years. Those tests opened debate in intelligence
circles over whether a new generation of nuclear warheads was in
fact based on stolen classified information from the U.S., the
report states.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. did not become ``fully aware of the magnitude of the
counter-intelligence problem at the nuclear laboratories until 1995
when officials received a classified document from China spelling
out that it had obtained U.S. design information on the Trident II
(W-88) warhead, one of the most nation's most precise and
sophisticated weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But the president was not briefed about the counterintelligence
failures until early 1998, the report states.
</P>
<P>
   And despite repeated thefts of nuclear weapons technology, the
report finds that security at the nation's nuclear weapons
laboratories remains deficient.
</P>
<P>
   But the White House is quick to point out that after being
briefed in 1998, Clinton ordered the Department of Energy to adopt
a counterintelligence plan, but that plan will not be take full
effect until next year, the report states.
</P>
<P>
   The report also finds that in the late 1990s, China stole
developmental and research technology that, once developed, could
be used for space-based weapons to attack satellites and
submarines.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to the report's findings, Arnold Kanter, a senior
fellow at the Washington-based Forum for International Policy, said
the spy network is not surprising since espionage has has gone on
as long as there have been countries.
</P>
<P>
   The important question to ask, Kanter said, is what has China
done with its intelligence gathering? The answer: not much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chinese nuclear capabilities are still primitive and modest,''
said Kanter, who served in the Bush Administration as
undersecretary of State for political affairs and senior director
for defense policy and arms control at the National Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this has been going on for 20 years, the fruits of this
have not been manifested,'' said Kanter, noting that the Chinese
have two dozen nuclear warheads in comparison to the United States'
more than 6,000.
</P>
<P>
   While the threat of spying is a serious one, Kanter said, ``We
shouldn't leap to the opposite conclusion of saying, 'Oh my God,
China has become a major threat to us.' It hasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to intelligence gains at the nation's nuclear
laboratories, the committee found that the Chinese government
benefited from failed launches of commercial satellites made by
American companies.
</P>
<P>
   The report documents three failed launches of commercial
satellites made by Loral Space and Communications and Hughes
Electronics Corp. since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   After their satellites crashed on Chinese soil, House
investigators allege that the companies gave the Chinese highly
classified information to help improve the reliability of their
rocket launches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Illegally transmitted information is useful for the design
and improved reliability of future PRC ballistic missiles as
well,'' the report states.
</P>
<P>
   The committee found that lax monitoring aided the Chinese in
obtaining information. For example, security personnel were offered
prostitutes by the Chinese to look the other way. Some were found
sleeping on the job and reporting to work under the influence of
alcohol. And security details at the satellite launch sites were
insufficiently manned.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Dore, spokesperson for Hughes, said his company
cooperated fully with the House committee. ``We agree that security
has to be improved,'' Dore said. ``We contend that we followed all
the regulations at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also offers 38 recommendations to improving security
at the national labs, including:
</P>
<P>
   _ The president report to congressional leaders at least every
six months on the actions being taken to respond to espionage by
China.
</P>
<P>
   _ Appropriate agencies should conduct a damage assessment of the
implications of the security breaches.
</P>
<P>
   _ Congressional committees should consider whether the
Department of Energy should continue to maintain U.S. nuclear
weapons responsibility.

CAMPAIGN-FINANCE FIGURE LINKED TO TECHNOLOGY THEFT BY CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A new congressional report has determined that
there is a connection between a key figure in the campaign finance
controversy and China's theft of sensitive military-related
technology from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The report from a select House committee states that Johnny
Chung, a Chinese-American at the heart of the campaign finance
controversy, was given $300,000 by two Chinese military officials
in an apparent effort to establish one of them, the daughter of a
Chinese general, in the United States so she could acquire American
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Liu Chaoying, the daughter of the Chinese General, Liu Huaqing,
is now the vice president of China Aerospace International Holdings
and is involved in acquisition of missile and space technology for
China. She holds the rank of lieutenant colonel in the Chinese
army.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional report says that in the summer of 1996, Chung
met in Hong Kong with Ms. Liu and Gen. Ji Shengde, the director of
Chinese military intelligence. Afterward, it says, Chung received
$300,000 from Ms. Liu and Ji.
</P>
<P>
   Chung, who pleaded guilty to fraud last year in the inquiry into
Democratic Party fund-raising practices, has described his
activities and relationship with Ms. Liu to the FBI. The FBI was
able to confirm that the money had been deposited in his bank
account and traced the money back to Hong Kong and confirmed that
Chinese army officials probably served as the conduit for the
funds, the report states.
</P>
<P>
   A month after the meeting with Ms. Liu in Hong Kong, Chung
formed Marswell Investments Inc. Ms. Liu was designated as
president of the company, based in Torrance, Calif. She made two
trips to the United States, one in July 1996, and one in August
1996. During the July visit, Chung arranged for her to attend a
Democratic National Committee fund-raiser, where she met President
Clinton and executives in the import-export business, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   Her August trip was at Chung's invitation, after he told her
that he had contacted Boeing and McDonnell Douglas regarding her
interest in purchasing aircraft parts.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after that, however, Chung's and Ms. Liu's alleged
involvement in the campaign finance scandal was reported, and she
left the United States. Marswell Investments is now dormant, the
report stated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of Colonel Liu's contacts was apparently to
establish reputable ties and financing for her acquisition of
technology such as telecommunications and aircraft parts,'' the Cox
report said.

 Terry Trucco's most recent article for Arts and Leisure was about
the Virsky Ukrainian National Dance Company.  
 By TERRY TRUCCO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Not many story ballets are based on the lives of real
people while they are still living. Yet the ballerina Lynn Seymour
recalls that she wasn't surprised when the choreographer Kenneth
MacMillan asked her to create the role of Anna Anderson, the woman
who for years claimed to be the Grand Duchess Anastasia, a daughter
of Czar Nicholas II of Russia, in a one-act ballet, ``Anastasia,''
that he choreographed in 1967 for Berlin's Deutsche Oper Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a fascinating woman, even if she wasn't Anastasia,''
Ms. Seymour said of Anderson, who died in 1984. ``You empathized
with her because she was trying so hard to establish who she was.
And you wondered, how could she have made all this up? At the time,
we wanted to believe her claims were true.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of the mysterious woman who thought she was Anastasia
so captivated MacMillan that in 1971 he expanded the work into a
eveninglong ballet for Britain's Royal Ballet, which performed it
in New York the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, on Thursday, ``Anastasia'' returns to New York in the first
of eight performances to be presented by American Ballet Theater at
the Metropolitan Opera House. Dancing the title role on opening
night and again on June 11 will be Viviana Durante, a former
principal dancer with the Royal Ballet; she performed ``Anastasia''
with the Royal when the company staged a new production in 1996 and
was coached for the part by Ms. Seymour.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from a story filled with history, emotion and drama, Ms.
Seymour said, two themes inherent in the story _ the loss of
identity and the loneliness of the outsider _ attracted MacMillan
to the tale. ``He was fascinated by this 20th-century saga with its
issues of identity and rejection,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   MacMillan, who died in 1992, liked to build ballets around real
people who confronted problems that an audience could identify
with, she added.
</P>
<P>
   MacMillan based the ballet on two books, ``I, Anastasia,''
Anderson's 1958 autobiography, and ``Nicholas and Alexandra,'' a
1967 history of the last Czar, by Robert K. Massie. ``Kenneth
didn't like traditional romantic heroines who were perfect,'' Ms.
Seymour said. ``As a child, Anastasia was a bit of a tomboy, a bit
chubby and a bit of a problem. That added to the appeal for him.''
</P>
<P>
   The ballet depicts some of the dramatic, often harshly
contrasting events that the woman who claimed she was Anastasia
might have lived through in the days before and after the Czar's
family was executed in 1918. Set to music by Tchaikovsky, the first
two acts are lyrical renderings of the idyllic, if decaying,
Imperial Russia that Anastasia might have remembered.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lavish picnic on the Imperial yacht, with Anna dressed
in a sailor suit, and a grand ball to celebrate Anastasia's coming
of age just before the Revolution. But the surreal third act (the
original one-act work), set to music by the Czech composer Bohuslav
Martinu, unfolds in an asylum, where a confused woman claiming to
be Anastasia relives the horror of the post-Revolution years while
struggling to find her identity and hang onto her sanity.
</P>
<P>
   The style of the choreography deliberately follows the tone of
the content. The Act II ballroom scene, with its formal placement
of characters, is a bow to Marius Petipa, the Imperial Ballet's
master choreographer. But Act III is Expressionist, with so much
upper body movement for Anastasia that Ms. Seymour suggested that
Ms. Durante remove her point shoes during rehearsals to feel more
connected to the ground and freer to use her arms.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to add the ballet to Ballet Theater's repertory at
this time was fairly simple, said Kevin McKenzie, the company's
artistic director. `` `Anastasia' is a wonderful vehicle for a
ballerina,'' he said, adding that many of the company's recent
ballets had emphasized men's dancing. Because almost none of the
dancers had seen the work, he invited Ms. Durante to join Ballet
Theater as a principal dancer for the season; in addition to
``Anastasia,'' her roles include ``Romeo and Juliet'' and
``Giselle.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Durante, who has not performed ``Anastasia'' in three years,
was eager to dance the part again. ``It's not just a technical
role, but an emotional role, particularly in the third act when
she's seeing ghosts,'' she said during a recent conversation before
a rehearsal. ``Is she really seeing them or is she imagining them?
That's difficult to put on stage without words.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge is to purge the part of all sentimentality
and romance. ``She's angry, and she's real, and kind of losing her
mind, and her movements can't ever be romantic, like this,'' Ms.
Durante said, striking a graceful pose, arms out, more typical of
Juliet or Giselle than Anastasia.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Durante said she felt a kinship with a character who had
experienced painful loneliness. Born in Rome, she began dancing at
7 and because of her prodigious talents was sent to London at age
10 to study at the Royal Ballet School. ``I really couldn't speak
to people at first or be understood, and that left me to kind of
live in my own world,'' she said. ``I feel I missed out on my
childhood a lot. And that has left me with a slight pain, a slight
anger, that helps me relate to Anastasia.''
</P>
<P>
   Anastasia is a grown-up role best suited for a mature dancer,
and Ms. Durante, who is 32, said she could bring more understanding
to the part now than when she danced it three years ago. Indeed,
the last few years have been a change for her. After seven years as
a principal dancer with the Royal Ballet, she took a one-year
sabbatical from the company and ballet in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``After dancing almost all my life, I was kind of rejecting
ballet,'' she said. She didn't do class, didn't do a single plie.
Instead, she took acting lessons, rested and ``had fun,'' she said.
Eventually she realized she missed being on stage, missed ``the
energy performing and an audience gives.''
</P>
<P>
   She decided to refashion her career, becoming an international
touring artist. She has since danced with the Royal and will
perform with the company again this July, but as a guest. This year
she will also dance in Brazil, Italy, Chile and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm doing now is fulfilling,'' she said. ``A dancer's
career is very short, and I don't want to get stuck in one place.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the role is so complex, Ms. Durante said she never tires
of dancing Anastasia. ``The more you dance it, the more you search
inside yourself to relate to this woman,'' she said. ``Her story is
a struggle toward the truth, and I think that's what we're all
looking for _ a truth in life.''

APPEARANCE WITH CLINTON SHOWS HOW FAR GORE NEEDS TO GO 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDINBURG, Texas _ President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore
crossed paths here on Tuesday, a public pairing that inadvertently
highlighted just how far the vice president had to go in matching
his mentor's political skills.
</P>
<P>
   The president, in a warmly received 19-minute introductory
speech, heaped praise on his designated heir. The vice president
followed, giving a speech about economic development in poor
neighborhoods that went on twice as long as Clinton's and was laden
with bureaucratic phrases about applications, blueprints and
empowerment.
</P>
<P>
   It was less than two weeks ago that Clinton openly told a
reporter that he had been worried about Gore's so-far-undeclared _
and unengaging _ presidential campaign and that Gore needed to
loosen up. Tuesday was their first joint appearance since, creating
a moment that invited comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Cuomo, the secretary of housing and urban development,
who is close to Gore, accompanied the president here for the Fifth
Annual White House Community Empowerment Conference and could not
help but acknowledge the gap in their communications skills.
</P>
<P>
   The president is ``a master communicator of historic
proportions,'' Cuomo said. Gore, he added, meaning to praise him,
is ``a very effective communicator.''
</P>
<P>
   The president and vice president met here at this sun-baked
border town for an event intended to promote the administration's
establishment of ``empowerment zones,'' depressed areas where tax
breaks and investment have lured businesses and helped create
thousands of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   It was also a platform for Gore to promote his candidacy, and he
was the host. Clinton stopped by on his way to a vacation in
Florida to draw press attention to the event.
</P>
<P>
   The president did all he could to give Gore center stage. The
vice president's aides announced the only official ``news'' of the
day, a clarification of a federal regulation to reassure legal
immigrants that applying for welfare would not jeopardize their
immigration status.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the conference setting was an effort to boost Gore's
standing with Hispanic voters. It was set here in the backyard of
Gov. George W. Bush, the leading contender for the Republican
presidential nomination, in a heavily Hispanic area.
</P>
<P>
   The stage was set, unusually, with the official seals of both
the president and the vice president. And Clinton spent most of his
introduction praising Gore as a full and equal partner in the
successes of the empowerment zones that the administration has
created across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of his unparalleled combination of creativity and
energy, experience and determination, I asked the vice president to
take the lead in turning this vision we had into reality,'' Clinton
told the audience of a few hundred people assembled from these
zones.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a challenge, as all of you have seen, that he embraced
passionately,'' Clinton said, adding that he was ``profoundly
grateful'' to Gore for leading the way.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spoke for 40 minutes. He hardly mentioned the president
but, like Clinton, he infused his speech with flowing hand
gestures, and personalized his stories, mentioning people who had
benefited from empowerment zones. He told several people's stories
at length.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo, a confidant of Gore and his debate adviser in 1996,
visited with reporters after the speech to highlight the
empowerment zones, but the talk turned quickly to Gore's
performance. Cuomo, son of another recognized master orator, said
that while Gore's presentation had been effective, the vice
president had ``a certain amount of work to do'' in his speech and
that the subject matter was ``a very factual, technical area.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the material you have,'' Cuomo said. ``We all have
our own style.''

THE FLEXIBLE ART OF ART CRITICISM
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: This story also moved in the ``a'' national news file)  
 By LEAH GARCHIK  
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes a critic can go both ways:
</P>
<P>
   When the Piazzoni murals in the Old Main Library _ recently
removed from the building that will become the Asian Art Museum _
were unveiled, ``critics who had raised expectations about the
panels fell silent,'' writes  &UR; Anthony Lee &LR;  in his new book,
``Painting on the Left'' (University of California; $50, $24.95
paperback).
</P>
<P>
   ``Their content was difficult to read from a distance,'' writes
the art historian, and the ``murals looked inferior'' to paintings
on display nearby. ``Piazzoni had to wait years for another mural
commission.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee is also author of a letter to the Asian Art Museum pleading
that the murals be allowed to remain. The murals ``immediately
caused great interest,'' he wrote, adding that even the great
muralist  &UR; Diego Rivera &LR;  had realized ``how important they were as
artistic and cultural statements. ... If we today think that San
Francisco holds high status as a significant cultural center, it
was precisely because of works like Piazzoni's, so many years ago,
that such a cultural project began.''
</P>
<P>
   The murals are being prepared for shipment to conservation
laboratories, but a legal suit challenging their move is under way.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &UR; KKK'S OFFER AND PROMISE ARE SPURNED &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Can the Ku Klux Klan help out with highway cleaning? A March 4
letter from an ACLU lawyer in Baltimore to the government of Anne
Arundel County, Md., is reprinted in the latest issue of Harper's.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Dwight Sullivan &LR; , the lawyer, begins by noting that when the
KKK asked to participate in an Adopt-a-Road program, the county
responded by suspending the program.
</P>
<P>
   The KKK agrees, said the lawyer, to replace the ``Ku Klux Klan''
name on the sign with ``The Invincible Empire Realm of Maryland.''
Furthermore, he writes, ``the organization does not plan for its
members to wear robes while engaging in trash collection.''
</P>
<P>
   We talked with Sullivan last week. In response to his letter, he
said, the county changed its suspension of the program to a
permanent shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MIRREN'S SAD TALE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Helen Mirren &LR;  told the Sunday Mail of London that she is sore
that American actresses occupy their own celebrity tier.
</P>
<P>
   ``My status in Hollywood is zero,'' she said. ``I'm certainly
not on any A-list or any B-, C-, D- or E-list. I want to be
incredibly rich and famous. It would be like nirvana starring in a
big Hollywood movie. Think of the unlimited money. Of course, I
could act them off the screen. What  &UR; Demi Moore &LR;  does is not
acting.''
</P>
<P>
   MSNBC's  &UR; Jeannette Walls &LR;  says Mirren is particularly sore that
Moore,  &UR; Michelle Pfeiffer &LR; ,  &UR; Sharon Stone &LR; ,  &UR; Julia Roberts &LR;  and
 &UR; Meryl Streep &LR;  have been named as possibilities to play Jane
Tennison  &LR; in some kind of movie version of ``Prime Suspect.''
Streep has declined the role, writes Walls, saying that Mirren
plays it better than she could.

<P>
   _ In Belgium,  &UR; Noel Godin &LR; , the custard pie-tosser who targeted
 &UR; Bill Gates &LR;  last year, has formed a political party called TARTE
to participate in regional elections in Brussels in June. A
statement said the party promised nothing, stood for no one and was
totally irresponsible.

<P>
   _ The U.S. government has fined Harper's Bazaar $31,000 for
sending  &UR; Naomi Campbell &LR;  and  &UR; Kate Moss &LR;  to Cuba for a photo shoot
last year. The fines, levied by the Treasury, were for violating
the U.S. embargo by ``trading with the enemy,'' paying airfares and
hotel and meal expenses. The government was said by the British
newspaper the Observer to have been particularly annoyed about the
supermodels' having tea with  &UR; Fidel Castro &LR; , after which Campbell
announced that he is ``an inspiration to the world.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a recent Sunday, Robert La Fosse of New York City
Ballet prepared to put on the sleek black wig, orange gloves and
cape of the evil sorcerer Von Rothbart for the final performance of
Peter Martins' ``Swan Lake.'' Monday is the company's one day off,
but his agenda was already full: he was helping to select cast
members for a coming Asian tour of ``West Side Story.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, the elaborate wig and makeup of Von Rothbart
packed away, La Fosse looked more like his wholesome, all-American
self in rehearsals for two of the three new ballets, collectively
called ``Duke!'' and set to Duke Ellington's music, that have their
premiere on Thursday as part of City Ballet's program celebrating
jazz. (Also on the bill is a new ballet by Martins to music by
Wynton Marsalis.)
</P>
<P>
   In one studio La Fosse put a cast of 20 through the vigorous
paces of his own new Ellington work, ``Rockin' in Rhythm,'' while
in another he took direction from Susan Stroman, whose Ellington
ballet, ``Blossom Got Kissed,'' features a central duet in which he
partners Maria Kowroski.
</P>
<P>
   A true day off is a rarity for La Fosse. During his 13 years as
a City Ballet principal dancer, the unusually versatile performer
has also appeared on stages far from Lincoln Center. His projects
have included collaborating with choreographers like Margie Gillis
and John Kelly and appearing at the downtown performance venue
Mother, where he recently performed his own interpretation of
Isadora Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   His Broadway resume includes a stint in Bob Fosse's ``Dancin',''
and 10 years ago he won a Tony Award nomination for his multiple
roles in ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1985, La Fosse has regularly combined performing and
choreographing. The Ellington work will be his seventh for City
Ballet. ``Choreography is not just making up steps,'' he said
during a recent interview at his sunny apartment near Lincoln
Center. ``There's a lot to think about _ music, costuming. I love
the research that goes into a project. I love reading biographies,
and I'm fascinated by digging in, finding out things I didn't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   His current projects have presented ample research
opportunities. He has just begun to plan his choreography for the
Metropolitan Opera's world premiere of John Harbison's ``Great
Gatsby,'' set for December. It will include a tango and a fox trot,
and he is already delighting in the prospect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dance of that period is so identifiable,'' he said. ``I'm
getting to research and explore time periods I would have wanted to
live through. Also, it's exciting to work on a new opera; there are
no other productions people can compare it to.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Ellington piece, set to four early compositions, La
Fosse visited swing clubs and studied all the films with which
Ellington was involved. His dancers wear jazz shoes and are more
likely to thrust their hands in their pockets than to hold them in
an academically correct position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm using the more acrobatic kind of swing dancing, with all
the wild lifts,'' he said. ``I want it to have an underground
feeling; at the time, what these dancers were doing was new and
racy.''
</P>
<P>
   He is working closely with William Ivey Long, the costume
designer for all three Ellington works (Garth Fagan is the third
choreographer), offering his own doodles for costume ideas and
asking Long to ``take the period and do your twist on it.''
</P>
<P>
   This work represents a switch from La Fosse's previous City
Ballet choreography, all of which placed considerable demands on
the dancers' classical technique. But a foray into vernacular and
social dancing represents a homecoming for him, and his inclusion
of a tap duet for the twin brothers Kurt and Kyle Froman is a nod
toward his own roots.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Beaumont, Texas, he began his dance studies with
acrobatics, tap and jazz, working his way to ballet. ``I did
musicals as a kid,'' he said, ``and there was always a question as
to where I would end up. When I was 17 and moved to New York, I
always thought I would end up on Broadway.''
</P>
<P>
   But the ballet world beckoned; that same year he was offered an
apprenticeship with American Ballet Theater. He spent a few busy
years in the corps, taking advantage of the company's labor lockout
to perform in ``Dancin','' and began acquiring more important roles
once Mikhail Baryshnikov became artistic director in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was trying to develop American dancers from within the
company, and pulling away from the star system, which worked to my
advantage,'' La Fosse said. His early featured parts included
Americana roles like the second sailor in Robbins' ``Fancy Free''
and the Champion Roper in Agnes De Mille's ``Rodeo'' (where his tap
background came in handy), but an important rite of passage was the
title role in Balanchine's ``Prodigal Son,'' in which he proved
himself as a performer of both technical and dramatic power.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He remained with Ballet Theater until 1986, taking on most of
the major princely roles in the classics but also proving
especially suited to the works of Robbins and Twyla Tharp. When
Kenneth MacMillan staged his ``Romeo and Juliet'' for the company,
La Fosse was his choice for Romeo on opening night.
</P>
<P>
   Despite flourishing at Ballet Theater, he felt the need to take
a break. Contributing to his decision were burnout from the heavy
touring schedule and his growing interest in choreography. ``There
was an element of wanting to do other things besides the ballet,''
he said. ``I was scared of change, and at the time I didn't know
what I wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   While La Fosse was mulling over his options, an invitation from
Robbins at City Ballet proved irresistible: ``I thought about it
for maybe half a second, and called back the next day,'' La Fosse
said.
</P>
<P>
   A new repertory _ the vast array of works by George Balanchine
and Robbins _ opened to him, as did an increased opportunity to do
more choreographing through City Ballet's American Music Festival
and periodic Diamond Project infusions of new works. He also
choreographed for students at the School of American Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   As his choreographic reputation grew, through works that
reflected sophisticated musicality and craftsmanship, La Fosse
received invitations to create diverse dances like a ``Stars and
Stripes'' spoof for Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo and an
eveninglong ``Nutcracker,'' set in Russia, for the Wilmington-based
Russian Ballet of Delaware, and opera productions at both Lincoln
Center houses.
</P>
<P>
   But his busy schedule as a choreographer has in no way
diminished his enthusiasm for being onstage. Now 39, he has scaled
back his classical roles, but he still dons the sneakers and blue
jeans for Tony in ``West Side Story Suite'' (in which he can be
seen next week), and has continued to perform in Robbins'
``Concert'' and ``Fancy Free.'' And Von Rothbart was just the
latest addition to his repertory of meaty character roles in City
Ballet's few full-evening works, which he discusses with eager
enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be able to look like a 16-year-old Tony one night
and to be an old Dr. Coppelius the next,'' he said. ``I love the
contrast. For Von Rothbart, I made a choice not to be physically
forceful, but to be an all-powerful figure who could do almost
anything with just a look.''
</P>
<P>
   With a dancer's nemesis of a 40th birthday looming, La Fosse has
found a comfortable creative balance. ``I am where I want to be,''
he said. ``I still love performing. I'm past the point of having to
figure out something else to do other than dance. I've decided I'm
going to dance as long as I can, but I won't go onstage and dance
roles beyond my means. It's also fascinating to move people around.
As a choreographer, you have total freedom; you're making other
people look good. You're in control.''
</P>
<P>
   A return to Broadway, this time as a choreographer, may be in
his future; he has been working on a musical version of the 1980
film ``Urban Cowboy.'' ``Musical theater is one of the things I
want to do, but it's been hard finding the right project,'' he
said. ``I hope to work in different venues; I don't want to
choreograph just one kind of dance. I want people to recognize my
choreography, but I want to be able to work in different periods,
different styles. There are all kinds of projects to do as a
choreographer, and it can be boring if you limit yourself. This is
all an education.''

COLLEGE STUDENTS SET OFF ON TRIP TO LEARN FIRMS' SECERETS OF
SUCCESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ENRIQUE RIVERO  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. -- Three Pepperdine University friends are
hitting the road in search of the perfect company.
</P>
<P>
   Starting today, Alissa Andress and childhood surfing buddies
Nathan Gebhard and Michael Marriner are riding into the heart of
corporate America on a three-month search for what makes America's
50 or so best companies tick.
</P>
<P>
   They'll tour the companies and sit down with various company
heads, grilling them on the corporate structure, employee benefits
and anything else that contributes toward creating a successful
business.
</P>
<P>
   They'll be traveling with ease in a recreational vehicle, hooked
up to the Internet and sending out regular missives on their
findings.
</P>
<P>
   They also intend to write a book about the trip.
</P>
<P>
   It's a way to gain insight into successful corporate structures
directly from the people who run the companies, said Andress, 23,
who graduated in April with a degree in international business.
They hope to pass on what they learn to the public and also use
those lessons when they strike out on their own business ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a textbook teaching me, not a teacher, but real
people,'' Andress said. ``Also, it's an amazing opportunity. How
many 23-year-olds get to travel around the country in a RV all
summer, all paid-for? I get to write a book at 23. I can't imagine
anything more fun than that.''
</P>
<P>
   The trip is patterned on a course taught by a former Pepperdine
business professor who has since moved to another university, said
Gebhard, 22, a business administration major who just completed his
junior year.
</P>
<P>
   To finance the trip, the trio obtained sponsorship from a number
of firms, including Monster.com, an Internet job search service
that is providing a link for the trio's Web page. Other sponsors
include Internet service provider Mindspring, and computer and
software giants Sun Microsystems and Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   This won't be the first time Andress, Gebhard and Marriner have
visited companies across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   During their last summer break, Gebhard and Marriner traveled
the western United States, from Los Angeles to Seattle, across to
Montana and on down to Utah, visiting companies such as Boeing Co.
and Nucor Steel's mill in Plymouth, Utah.
</P>
<P>
   And during winter break, Gebhard and Andress visited some
high-tech companies in Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   Each company they visited had its own formula for success. For
example, Nucor Steel had only four layers of management, ``which
translates into: a guy sweeping the floor is only three promotions
away from the CEO,'' Gebhard said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the employee pay system was based on a combination of
straight hourly pay and productivity, which encouraged employees to
work harder. This, they say, has resulted in a $4.2 billion company
that made No. 374 on the latest Fortune 500 list.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was incredible, we learned a lot of stuff,'' Gebhard said.
``Each company had its own individual lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   They learned so much that they wanted to do it again this
summer, only more extensively. The question, however, was how to
finance the trip, which was ``way too expensive'' for some college
students, said Marriner, 21, a biology and sports medicine double
major.
</P>
<P>
   The answer came to Marriner and Gebhard after a day of surfing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sitting in the jacuzzi brainstorming . . . and we came
up with the idea to gain sponsorship, to turn the interviews into a
book and place them on a Web site,'' Marriner said.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site -- roadtrip.monster.com -- will serve as a way to
keep the public up to date on the trio's findings, once it's
operational on Friday. It will also allow Web readers to pose their
own queries to the company heads. Those questions will be taken
into the interviews and answers will posted on the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``So basically it's almost a reader-driven project,'' Marriner
said.
</P>
<P>
   The trio is working with several editors on a book deal.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the three plan to use what they learn to start a
business together someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to take this whole experience and put the best
company in the world together,'' Gebhard said.

   Sometimes a critic can go both ways:
</P>
<P>
   When the Piazzoni murals in the Old Main Library _ recently
removed from the building that will become the Asian Art Museum _
were unveiled, ``critics who had raised expectations about the
panels fell silent,'' writes  &UR; Anthony Lee &LR;  in his new book,
``Painting on the Left'' (University of California; $50, $24.95
paperback).
</P>
<P>
   ``Their content was difficult to read from a distance,'' writes
the art historian, and the ``murals looked inferior'' to paintings
on display nearby. ``Piazzoni had to wait years for another mural
commission.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee is also author of a letter to the Asian Art Museum pleading
that the murals be allowed to remain. The murals ``immediately
caused great interest,'' he wrote, adding that even the great
muralist  &UR; Diego Rivera &LR;  had realized ``how important they were as
artistic and cultural statements. ... If we today think that San
Francisco holds high status as a significant cultural center, it
was precisely because of works like Piazzoni's, so many years ago,
that such a cultural project began.''
</P>
<P>
   The murals are being prepared for shipment to conservation
laboratories, but a legal suit challenging their move is under way.

<P>
   &UR; KKK'S OFFER AND PROMISE ARE SPURNED &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Can the Ku Klux Klan help out with highway cleaning? A March 4
letter from an ACLU lawyer in Baltimore to the government of Anne
Arundel County, Md., is reprinted in the latest issue of Harper's.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Dwight Sullivan &LR; , the lawyer, begins by noting that when the
KKK asked to participate in an Adopt-a-Road program, the county
responded by suspending the program.
</P>
<P>
   The KKK agrees, said the lawyer, to replace the ``Ku Klux Klan''
name on the sign with ``The Invincible Empire Realm of Maryland.''
Furthermore, he writes, ``the organization does not plan for its
members to wear robes while engaging in trash collection.''
</P>
<P>
   We talked with Sullivan last week. In response to his letter, he
said, the county changed its suspension of the program to a
permanent shutdown.

   &UR; MIRREN'S SAD TALE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Helen Mirren &LR;  told the Sunday Mail of London that she is sore
that American actresses occupy their own celebrity tier.
</P>
<P>
   ``My status in Hollywood is zero,'' she said. ``I'm certainly
not on any A-list or any B-, C-, D- or E-list. I want to be
incredibly rich and famous. It would be like nirvana starring in a
big Hollywood movie. Think of the unlimited money. Of course, I
could act them off the screen. What  &UR; Demi Moore &LR;  does is not
acting.''
</P>
<P>
   MSNBC's  &UR; Jeannette Walls &LR;  says Mirren is particularly sore that
Moore,  &UR; Michelle Pfeiffer &LR; ,  &UR; Sharon Stone &LR; ,  &UR; Julia Roberts &LR;  and
 &UR; Meryl Streep &LR;  have been named as possibilities to play Jane
Tennison  &LR; in some kind of movie version of ``Prime Suspect.''
Streep has declined the role, writes Walls, saying that Mirren
plays it better than she could.

totally irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
   _ The U.S. government has fined Harper's Bazaar $31,000 for
sending  &UR; Naomi Campbell &LR;  and  &UR; Kate Moss &LR;  to Cuba for a photo shoot
last year. The fines, levied by the Treasury, were for violating
the U.S. embargo by ``trading with the enemy,'' paying airfares and
hotel and meal expenses. The government was said by the British
newspaper the Observer to have been particularly annoyed about the
supermodels' having tea with  &UR; Fidel Castro &LR; , after which Campbell
announced that he is ``an inspiration to the world.''

FUND-RAISER WHO BROUGHT ASIAN MONEY TO DEMOCRATS TO PLEAD GUILTY TO
CONSPIRACY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ John Huang, the prolific fund-raiser at the center
of the furor over Democratic Party financing of President Clinton's
re-election, will plead guilty in federal court to a single felony
count of conspiring to make illegal contributions, the Justice
Department and Huang's lawyer said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A frequent White House visitor and prominent figure behind
Democratic efforts to solicit millions of dollars in political
contributions from Asian-Americans, Huang was part of a
fund-raising operation later found to be tainted by questionable or
illegal contributions. In at least one case, the money was funneled
through a top Chinese intelligence official.
</P>
<P>
   Huang refused to testify at congressional investigations, and
thus became an absent star at Capitol Hill hearings. Republicans
vilified him as a symbol of abuse. They accused him of using his
fund-raising prowess to launder contributions to the Democrats and
burrow his way deep into the Clinton administration through a job
at the Commerce Department on behalf of his financial patrons, the
Riady family of Indonesia and its Asian-based conglomerate, the
Lippo Group.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of the $3.4 million Huang raised during the 1996
election campaign was returned as potentially improper.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Huang has for years seemed like a pivotal witness
who could jump start the Justice Department's criminal
investigation of political fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday, law-enforcement officials downplayed Huang's
significance, offering a mixed assessment of his cooperation.
Several officials suggested that he had provided no explosive
revelations and emerged as a lesser figure than he seemed after
congressional hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Still, other officials said they wanted to question Huang more
extensively about his relationship with the Riady family and his
dealings with presidential aides like Harold Ickes, a former White
House deputy chief of staff who helped manage fund-raising when
Huang was brought in as a fund-raiser for the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed plea agreement, which Huang is expected to formally
accept in a week or two, is unusual. Under one of its terms,
Justice Department officials said they will acknowledge that
investigators have unearthed no evidence that Huang engaged in any
espionage or violated national security laws, Justice Department
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   That finding would directly rebut and, in effect, dismiss an
important conclusion by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee,
which investigated how the Democrats financed Clinton's
re-election. In its March 1998 report, the panel found that China
wanted to influence political campaigns and policies in Washington
and that Huang ``may possibly'' have had a direct financial
relationship with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Another provision in the deal would grant Huang sentencing
leniency in exchange for his cooperation, which has been underway
for the last six months, Justice Department officials said. Under
the arrangement, he would be spared jail and placed on one-year's
probation. Under the law, he could be sentenced to a maximum of
five years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am greatly relieved for John and his family that his ordeal
is almost over,'' said Ty Cobb, Huang's attorney, who confirmed
that Huang would plead guilty under the terms of the deal outlined
by the Justice Department. ``I also commend the Justice Department
for stepping up to the plate and acknowledging that John is not and
never was a spy.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans scoffed at the deal, accusing the Justice
Department of allowing Huang to escape punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what information they're getting, but it
certainly appears to be a sweetheart deal,'' said Michael Madigan,
the former Republican chief counsel for the Senate investigating
committee. ``It certainly looks like they've got the rug pulled up
and the broom in the other hand. I hope that isn't the case.''
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Department officials said that, in the end, the case
against Huang was weaker and narrower than they initially believed.
The conspiracy charge against Huang dates back to a period between
1992 and 1994 and focuses on two contributions totaling $7,500, one
to a mayoralty candidate in Los Angeles, the other to a California
Democratic fund. He was not charged with any specific act related
to his fund raising for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb would not discuss the nature or extent of Huang's
cooperation, but law enforcement officials said that Huang had been
meeting extensively with investigators from the Justice
Department's campaign finance unit and from the offices of several
independent counsels, including the Whitewater prosecutor, Kenneth
Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Huang did not make an appearance Tuesday. Justice Department
officials, who filed the one-count criminal information in federal
court in Los Angeles, said he would acknowledge wrongdoing in
exchange for a deal in which he will be placed on a year of
probation without a jail sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The deal suggested that prosecutors are re-energizing the nearly
3-year-old campaign finance inquiry. Last Friday, Yah Lin Trie, a
Democratic fund-raiser and longtime Arkansas friend of Clinton,
pleaded guilty in Little Rock to political fund-raising charges and
agreed to cooperate with the Justice Department's campaign finance
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   But with Trie said by some officials to be unlikely to provide
revelations and with Huang shedding little new light on the issue,
it is unclear whether the Justice Department is preparing for a new
prosecutorial assault or is, as some officials predict, nearing the
end of the long inquiry.

DEMOCRACY ACTIVISM A WAR CASUALTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE _ The Western allies want to replace President Slobodan
Milosevic's regime with a more democratic government, but one of
the casualties of NATO's bombing campaign has been the democracy
movement here, pro-Western activists say.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with activists, dissidents, and intellectuals suggest
that those who want Yugoslavia to have a more open, western-style
democracy believe that the NATO bombing has killed what little
credibility they had with ordinary Serbs longing for the
certainties of life they had under communist rule.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of blaming Milosevic for making his country the pariah
of the international community, most people are said to feel that
NATO has unjustifiably targeted them with its bombs, killing
innocent civilians and causing hardship by cutting electricity and
water supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have fought a lonely battle to wean Yugoslavia from
authoritarianism say NATO's bombing campaign has silenced them and
emboldened the Milosevic regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the collateral damage of this war,'' said Dujan Masic,
who heads an association of independent journalists. ``How do you
talk about human rights and building democracy when the world's
leading democracies are bombing you?''
</P>
<P>
   The simple answer, say pro-democracy activists, is that you
don't. Since the war began, the government has passed laws that
allow it to hold people without charge for up to 60 days. People
are wary of saying anything that could be construed as critical of
the government. And still others who want to criticize the
government can't bring themselves to do it because they are
equally, if not more, angry at the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just pro-democracy activists who question NATO's
bombing. Jiri Dienstbier, the United Nations human rights
investigator in the former Yugoslavia, believes the NATO raids have
effectively destroyed the pro-democracy movement.
</P>
<P>
   Goran Milicevic, a professor at the University of Belgrade and a
leading dissident, said the pro-democracy movement ``collapsed
overnight'' when the bombing began.
</P>
<P>
   Public confidence in pro-democracy groups has also declined.
Natasha Kandic, director of the Humanitarian Law Center here, said
people simply stopped coming to her office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people are afraid,'' she said. ``Emergency laws were a
clear sign that everybody is in danger. It is better to be quiet or
focus on the NATO bombardment.''
</P>
<P>
   Dissent was further chilled by the April 11 assassination of
Slavko Curuvija, editor of an influential newspaper and magazine
that was critical of the Milosevic regime. Curuvija was gunned down
on his doorstep in broad daylight.
</P>
<P>
   The government denies that state agents had anything to do with
Curuvija's slaying and suggest that he had crossed organized crime
groups who were determined to get rid of him.
</P>
<P>
   But that slaying, and the selective arrests and interrogations
of those who criticize the government, has led many dissidents to
conclude that discretion is the better course. Many will not talk
on the telephone. Some even changed e-mail addresses, until they
learned the government controls the internet providers.
</P>
<P>
   Vojin Dimitrijevic has spent much of his life advocating for
human rights in a country where to do so was to court arrest. But
Dimitrijevic believes NATO has set the democracy movement back more
than anything Milosevic has done in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long run, the biggest collateral damage of this war is
the shattered possibilities for democracy,'' says Dimitrijevic, a
law professor and director of the Belgrade Center for Human Rights.
``We envy those who are afraid only of bombs.''
</P>
<P>
   In the handful of cities and towns where there has been open
criticism of government policy over Kosovo, people have been
arrested, discouraging other potential critics, human rights
activists say.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear statements that the war should end, but that's as far
as they can go,'' said Milicevic. ``I would be utterly surprised if
there were street protests, even if we didn't have water for a
week. It's not a question of civic courage. It's a question of
valuing your life. No one's died of stinking, but people have died
of bullets.''
</P>
<P>
   Student activists considered holding a street protest against
Milosevic two months ago. But, said one of the student leaders,
Stanimir Miljkovic, the plan was dropped when the students
considered the likely international reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Madeleine Albright would get on television and point to our
protest as evidence that NATO's strategy was working, so we would
be inviting more bombs on our people,'' said Miljkovic, who
contends the bombing is counterproductive and inhumane.
</P>
<P>
   Besides being critical of NATO's bombing campaign, pro-democracy
activists feel the West has paid lip service to their cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no real peace or stability in this region unless
we get on the road to democracy and a market economy,''
Dimitrijevic said. ``But the international community has never
really seriously considered this.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Dimitrijevic said, the West economically and
politically isolated Yugoslavia, a policy that has only helped what
he calls ``authoritarian and xenophobic extremists.''
</P>
<P>
   Pro-democracy groups have dramatically scaled back their
efforts. Instead of holding street demonstrations, as they did in
1996 and 1997, students have created a web site to argue for a more
open society. Miljkovic said the site gets about 2,500 hits a day,
most of them from outside Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Dimitrijevic contends that ``the air strikes in one night erased
10 years of hard work'' by people in the democratic opposition.
</P>
<P>
   But Miljkovic is more hopeful. He said if NATO stops bombing,
the pro-democracy movement can reassert itself immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the war stops, we will go on the streets,'' he said.

REPORT DETAILS ALLEGED N-SPYING BY CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ China has stolen secret information on every
currently deployed warhead in the US ballistic missile arsenal _
and has accumulated details about the neutron bomb, which the
United States has not yet deployed _ according to a congressional
investigation of Chinese espionage.
</P>
<P>
   The three-volume, 700-page report released Tuesday produced
swift and widespread reaction, with Republicans and Democrats
conceding that the allegations were indeed serious, though they
differed over what the long-term consequences would be for
relations between the United States and China.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Christopher Cox, the Republican from California
who headed the House select committee that undertook the
investigation, said the alleged thefts began in the late 1970s,
adding that it is ``exceptionally likely'' that China's spying
``continues to this very day.''
</P>
<P>
   The declassified report detailed what Representative Norman
Dicks, a Washington Democrat on the panel, said was ``no doubt one
of the worst counter-intelligence failures in the nation's
history,'' but the findings were conveyed in a ``worse-case
fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   With US-China relations already frayed by NATO's bombing of the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, the panel's conclusions brought fresh
concerns over such issues as whether China should gain entry into
the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The findings also increased calls among lawmakers, mostly
Republicans, for the resignation of Attorney General Janet Reno and
national security adviser Samuel R. ``Sandy'' Berger. Republicans
accused the administration of being slow to respond to earlier
reports of Chinese espionage. Democrats shot back that Republicans
should also share the blame since they were briefed on the problem
and also failed to act.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials emphasized that since the
report was completed earlier this year steps have been taken to
beef up security at the nation's nuclear laboratories. The report
was not released until Tuesday, and about a third of it remains
classified, including some details about the espionage
investigation at the Los Alamos weapons laboratory in New Mexico
where a scientist was fired in March after being under suspicion of
espionage for more than three years.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, whose agency oversees the
nuclear labs, warned of ``over-sensationalizing'' the report's
findings. ``There is no evidence of a wholesale loss of
information,'' he said. ``Not every allegation is a proven fact.''
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing, the foreign ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao
reiterated the Chinese government's earlier denial of the spying
charge, calling the allegations in the report ``groundless.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhu said the report's authors manufactured the allegations to
poison US-China relations in a ``despicable attempt'' to divert
attention from the May 7 bombing of the Chinese Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, attending an empowerment zone conference in
Texas, said he agreed with the ``overwhelming majority'' of the
committee's recommendations for tightening security at nuclear
labs. He also said he was ``particularly appreciative'' of the way
the bipartisan panel conducted its work.
</P>
<P>
   He said his administration was ``moving aggressively to tighten
security.'' Clinton noted he increased funding for
counter-intelligence in weapons labs to almost $40 million from
$2.6 million through an executive order signed in Feburary, and his
administration has conducted a major overhaul of security at
nuclear labs.
</P>
<P>
   He added that he strongly believes it was in the country's best
interest to continue its relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   But Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana, a ranking Republican on
the Senate Foreign Relations and Intelligence committees, said
Congress and Clinton should recognize that the ``United States may
now be at signficantly greater risk from a Chinese ballistic
missile attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Bob Smith, a New Hampshire Republican who also is a
candidate for president, said the report was devastating.
``Somebody is going to jail over this,'' he said. ``This is not
going to be accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, China ``mounted a widespread effort to
obtain US military technologies by any means _ legal or illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   China's ``insatiable appetite'' for US technology allowed it to
leap ``in a handful of years from 1950s-era strategic nuclear
capabilities'' to a position of having nuclear design information
``on par with our own.''
</P>
<P>
   The stolen information includes classified information on seven
US thermonuclear warheads, the report said. The information was
believed to have been obtained through Chinese espionage activities
that occurred in the 1980s, although the theft was not discovered
until the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Also stolen was classified design information for the ``neutron
bomb,'' which neither the United States, nor any other nation, has
deployed.
</P>
<P>
   The report singled out as particularly damaging the loss of
design material for the W-88, a miniaturized, tapered warhead
believed to be the most sophisticated nuclear weapon the United
States has ever built.
</P>
<P>
   The report also said that two US satellite manufacturers, Loral
Corp. and Hughes Electronics, ignored legal requirements and
allowed China to obtain information critical to its ballistic
missile program.
</P>
<P>
   The committee concluded that China will exploit elements of that
stolen US thermonuclear weapons information in its future design,
including a weapon that could be deployed as early as 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The panel of five Republicans and four Democrats found that most
thefts had occurred at US nuclear weapon labs at Los Alamos,
Lawrence Livermore, Oak Ridge and Sandia.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John F. Kerry said the report would ``make things
rougher'' between the United States and China. ``It has the
potential to have very damaging consequences, and it will depend on
level heads and leadership to avoid allowing us to dig ourselves a
hole here,'' said Kerry, a member of the Foreign Relations and
Senate Select committees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be very careful in how we proceed,'' Kerry
continued. ``China is much too important and the long-term
relationship is much too important to allow short-term politics to
manage this.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Thomas A. Daschle said ``it was too
early'' to determine whether the committee's conclusions would hurt
China's efforts to join the World Trade Organization. ``Clearly
this is not something that has helped us in the effort to move the
trade legislation along,'' he said.

GORE APPEALS TO HISPANICS IN HIGHLIGHTING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
PROGRAM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Upside down question mark needed before C in como) 
 
By ALAN BERNSTEIN 
and BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEBASTIAN, Texas _ ``Como estas?'' the vice president asked, his
Spanish pronunciation only a little bit off.
</P>
<P>
   Just fine, thank you, came the answer in English from some
residents of this mostly Hispanic farming town near the Mexican
border.
</P>
<P>
   They were feeling particularly fine because Al Gore had come to
their one-traffic-light hamlet Tuesday to highlight federal
economic development programs called empowerment zones.
</P>
<P>
   But as Gore began a two-day swing through Texas, another
question concerns the depth of support for the Democratic
presidential front-runner from Hispanic voters across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush is the early front-runner for the
Republican nomination partly because he carried out a plan in his
re-election campaign last year to show that GOP contenders can
appeal to Hispanic voters, capturing about 40 percent of the vote
in his gubernatorial re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Gore and the Democrats have the advantage of
traditional loyalty from Hispanic voters and the government
authority to deliver programs such as empowerment zones to
economically ragged, predominantly Hispanic areas like the Rio
Grande Valley in South Texas.
</P>
<P>
   After chatting with Gore in their front yard, Abelardo and
Martha Oviedo said they would vote for Gore if the presidential
nominees were Gore and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's just more into, like, the empowerment zone. Small
communities, you know,'' Abelardo Oviedo said of Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Oviedo, who works at a Head Start program funded with
empowerment zone money, said she enjoyed seeing both major parties
compete for the Hispanic support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great for the Hispanic voters, getting all the
attention and being recognized,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's trip had an official purpose _ meaning taxpayers pick up
the tab for the trip instead of his presidential campaign
contributors. As vice president, he delivered a speech to the 5th
Annual White House Community Empowerment Conference in Edinburg, a
gathering of empowerment zone participants from across the nation.
The federal government pours loans, tax credits for new businesses,
job training and infrastructure improvements into the zones.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's otherwise routine annual attendance at the conference
got a boost Tuesday with the added participation of President
Clinton, who flew here from Washington before heading to a vacation
in Florida. It was the first joint appearance of the president and
vice president outside of Washington since January, according to
Gore aides _ and the first since Clinton apparently irritated Gore
by telling The New York Times he has advised Gore to relax and have
fun as a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in his remarks to the empowerment zone representatives,
said he was leaving it to Gore to flesh out the details of the
president's creation of a new task force to improve economic
development in vote-rich Texas and California and the states
between them.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also got to announce a new White House policy assuring that
information from immigrants applying for government aid, such as
Medicaid, will not shared with immigration authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the president threw the policy spotlight to his
would-be successor with the national media out in force covering an
event aimed at Hispanic citizens' concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, it's a passing of the baton of sorts,'' said Joe
Garcia, former chairman of the Hidalgo County Democratic Party.
Garcia said Clinton ``is making the rounds to make sure those
alliances are there for Al Gore.``
</P>
<P>
   And Gore may need that help, particularly in Texas where Bush is
the rare Republican with solid Hispanic support.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia said Bush brings a number of advantages to the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is Spanish speaking, he comes to the Valley often,'' he
said. ``I can't point to a specific program that he (Bush) has done
that has been a tremendous benefit to South Texas. But he is
friendly, a great personality and does well with crowds.''
</P>
<P>
   The current Hidalgo County Democratic chairman, Ramon Garcia,
predicted Bush would not do as well as he did in his state race in
1998 because he has a more formidable opponent in Gore than Bush
did in Democratic gubernatorial nominee Garry Mauro.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Garcia said Gore's trip to the Valley was important if he
wanted the Hispanic vote. ``This is his way of saying, `I care,'''
Ramon Garcia said, noting that Gore is not as well known as Clinton
among Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo County, where Tuesday's event was held, is about 85
percent Hispanic. It is also the seventh poorest county in Texas,
with about 40 percent of the population living below the poverty
line.
</P>
<P>
   With the government business of the day out of the way, Gore was
scheduled to attend a ``Hispanic Democratic Unity'' reception, and
an empowerment zone ``fiesta,'' late Tuesday in McAllen.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Gore's campaign announced he had been endorsed by
15 of Texas's 17 Democratic U.S. House members. The only two
Democrats in the Texas delegation who did not endorse Gore were
U.S. Reps. Ralph Hall and Charles Stenholm.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's wife, Tipper, attended a Democratic women's lunch Tuesday
in Austin and touted her husband's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was scheduled to end his Texas trek Wednesday with a
campaign fund-raising luncheon and a forum on school safety in
Dallas, followed by fund-raising dinner in Houston.

BUSINESS TRAVEL: DISCOUNTED HOTEL ROOMS DO EXIST IN NEW YORK CITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Duplication warning: also moving in `t' category) 
(dal) 
 By JANE L. LEVERE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Discounted hotel rates are currently available in New York City,
despite public perception to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   According to Sean Hennessey, New York-based director of the
hospitality and leisure practice of PricewaterhouseCoopers,
occupancy rates at Manhattan hotels in the first quarter of this
year dropped to the high 70 percent range from 83 percent during
the comparable period a year earlier. This has led approximately
one-fifth of New York hotels _ particularly the larger ones _ to
lower their room rates, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some hotels are making their discounted rooms available longer
than they typically would,'' he said. ``If business travelers check
around, they are more likely to find last-minute bargains than they
would a year ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Another way to get a less expensive rate is to stay at one of
the new or refurbished hotels that have recently opened or will
soon; many offer introductory discounts. Following are some of
these hotels:
</P>
<P>
   The Benjamin, at 125 E. 50th St. between Lexington and Third
Avenues, is the newest of the 10 hotels owned by Manhattan East
Suite Hotels. Formerly the Hotel Beverly, the Benjamin has
undergone a $30 million renovation. It now has 209 rooms, including
98 one- and two-bedroom suites; Larry Forgione's restaurant, An
American Place, will move there next month. The Benjamin offers
special rates, good only on Saturdays and Sundays through the end
of the year, that range from $229 to $549 a night.
</P>
<P>
   The Holiday Inn Wall Street, a boutique hotel owned by RD
Management, a New York real estate developer, is situated at 15
Gold St., three blocks north of Wall Street. The hotel, which will
open next month, has 138 rooms, all with high-speed Internet
connections; 8-foot desks; safes; televisions with separate
Internet access, and CD players. Introductory rates, good through
Labor Day, range from $189 to $240 during the week and from $150 to
$225 on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   The Iroquois, a 114-room hotel at 49 W. 44th St. between Fifth
and Sixth Avenues owned by hotelier Shimmie Horn, is undergoing a
$13-million renovation transforming it from what management calls a
``standard'' hotel to a ``luxury boutique'' hotel in the style of a
private European mansion. A gourmet restaurant, whose chef formerly
worked at Lespinasse, will open in September. Rates through the end
of August are $169 for a deluxe room or $299 for a suite; both
include breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   The Time, a 192-room boutique hotel at 224 W. 49th St. between
Broadway and Eighth Avenue, is owned by New York-based Hampshire
Hotels and Resorts. The hotel was designed by Adam Tihany, whose
other projects include New York restaurants Jean Georges, Le Cirque
2000 and Remi. The Time's restaurant is Palladin, run by chef
Jean-Louis Palladin, formerly of Jean-Louis at the Watergate in
Washington, D.C. Rates through Aug. 31 range from $165 to $245.
</P>
<P>
   Although all of the new or refurbished hotels' discounts are
available through the summer, Hennessey warned that other
discounted rates now offered by more established hotels might not
be around much longer. ``Most hotels are saying their summer
tourist business and fall convention business appear strong again
this year,'' he said. &QL;

RAISING THE STAKES IN A PURCELL OPERA  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 30) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When performers make new recording alliances, they often start
by revisiting favorite works. Ideally, they do so for good reasons:
their ideas have changed, or scholarship has yielded new
perspective on a work. Just as likely, though, the motivation is
more mundane.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier recording may have run its course in sales and been
deleted or reduced to midprice, and the new contract may offer more
favorable royalty provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the terms of the new agreement between the conductor
Andrew Parrott and Sony, Parrott's second reading of Purcell's
``Dido and Aeneas'' (Sony Classical SK 62993; CD) is sufficiently
different from his classic 1981 Chandos recording, for better and
worse, that he cannot be charged with reduplication of the more
cynical kind.
</P>
<P>
   The new ``Dido'' may, in fact, be a move to keep big-label
cynicism at bay. When Parrott signed with Sony, there was less talk
of major repertory than of his crossover potential, so perhaps he
reasoned that a success with a work that had been a springboard for
him in the past might forestall the indignity of recording
``Baroque Tango Appalachia: The Film Score.''
</P>
<P>
   When Parrott and the Taverner Players and Choir made their first
``Dido and Aeneas'' recording (now on a midprice CD from Chandos),
period-instrument Purcell was largely uncharted territory. The only
competing gut-string, low-vibrato ``Dido,'' in fact, was a
vigorous, idiosyncratic 1979 recording by Joel Cohen and the Boston
Camerata on Harmonia Mundi France (never transferred to CD).
</P>
<P>
   Cohen took chances: a minimal string complement (one player to a
part) was augmented by flute, oboe and, briefly, tambourine, and
both the Sorceress and the Sailor were assigned to male voices.
Some of these touches seemed eccentric at the time, yet as
period-instrument ``Dido'' recordings have become commonplace,
other performers have adopted them, and musicological
justifications have sprouted, mostly after the fact.
</P>
<P>
   Parrott's 1981 ``Dido'' was more orthodox in its use of strings
only _ the instrumentation given in the Tenbury manuscript of 1777,
the earliest surviving score of this 1689 opera _ with two or three
players to a part, and harpsichord, theorbo and guitar in the
continuo group.
</P>
<P>
   His advances included a realization of the guitar dance
suggested after Belinda's ``Pursue thy conquest,'' the
interpolation of a hornpipe from ``The Married Beau'' as the finale
of the second act, and the execution of the thunder and ``horrid
music'' (ad libitum orchestral noise) called for at the end of the
Witches' scene.
</P>
<P>
   New as they were to disk, these ideas had been floating around
for some time. The ground bass figure for the guitar dance and the
adaptation of the hornpipe are included in the 1961 Novello edition
of the score, prepared by Margaret Laurie and Thurston Dart. The
demand for a thunderstorm is in the libretto. In modern-instrument
versions, conductors were inconsistent about the hornpipe (most
skipped it) and ignored the guitar piece and the storm completely.
</P>
<P>
   The real charm of Parrott's 1981 recording was its cast,
borrowed wholesale from the Consort of Musicke, then a young
early-music group with a superb Dowland series to its credit.
Breaking from the tradition of regal, almost Victorian portrayals
of the role of Dido, Emma Kirkby sang it with an energy, brightness
and vocal compactness that made the doomed Carthaginian Queen sound
almost girlish.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Nelson's equally clear-toned Belinda abetted that
characterization, and David Thomas showed Aeneas to be thoroughly
spineless, a plaything of the Witches and unable to sustain his
resolve after the rebuke from Dido.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on the assumption then current that ``Dido and Aeneas''
was composed for Josiah Priest's school for girls _ a notion
recently supplanted by the theory that the work may have had a more
professional performance for a royal audience a few weeks before _
Parrott made the Sorceress a mezzo-soprano and gave the other roles
to sopranos.
</P>
<P>
   For his new recording, Parrott has reconsidered everything and
nothing. Orchestral textures, vocal assignments and phrasings are
revised, yet the spirit and the overall shape of the recording
closely match those of the 1981 account.
</P>
<P>
   In several details, Parrott now follows Cohen: he has scaled
back the ensemble to single strings (though no winds), and in the
dance that follows the ``Fear no danger'' chorus, he adds a
tambourine to evoke a livelier, more rustic spirit than one hears
on his Chandos disk. And now, with musicological backing that Cohen
didn't have, Parrott has reassigned male voices to the Sorceress
and the Sailor.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Purely in instrumental terms, the new recording is generally an
improvement. Its most strikingly fresh characteristic is its string
timbre. Gone is the comparatively mellow sound of the earlier disk;
here, the Taverner strings play with a bright edge and acidic bite.
The ornamentation, both vocal and instrumental, is also more
florid, and the continuo players are more overtly pictorial; an
example is the rolling harpsichord arpeggiation that evokes the
unfurling flags, streamers and sails the Sorceress sings about.
</P>
<P>
   Both the guitar dance and the ``Married Beau'' hornpipe are
retained: this despite the assertion in the liner notes that the
interpolation was a decision made ``in the edition prepared for
this recording,'' as if it were something new.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the way that almost everything has been magnified
here, these dances appear in versions that are livelier and more
fully fleshed out than their 1981 counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Parrott's casting this time is less felicitous. Emily Van Evera,
one of the Enchantresses in 1981, has been promoted to Dido. She
has in common with Ms. Kirkby a light timbre and a judicious sense
of when to use vibrato, and her Dido is similarly youthful. But
hers is a more mannered portrayal. She is overwrought and
melodramatic both in her opening consultation with Belinda and at
the end, as she heads into her final lament.
</P>
<P>
   She is also given to little slides and dynamic manipulations
that seem interesting at first but quickly grow tiresome,
especially since the recording seems to make her hairpin accents in
the middle of words sound unattractively peaky.
</P>
<P>
   The Aeneas, Ben Parry, has a pleasant, light baritone, but apart
from matching this Dido's exaggerations, he offers little sense of
what Aeneas is about. The rest of the cast sings ably but without
particular distinction, although Hayden Andrews, as the Sorceress,
and Douglas Wooten, as the Sailor, follow the post-Cohen tradition
of characterizing their roles by toying with intonation and
accents.
</P>
<P>
   Where Parrott proves really daring is in his use of sound
effects. Indeed, his innovations here lead one to look back to his
earlier disk, and Cohen's, as the first bids in a curious
musicological poker game.
</P>
<P>
   After Cohen opened with his single strings, winds and male
singers, Parrott raised him a thunderclap and a couple of dances.
Nikolaus Harnoncourt (on Teldec) passed on the thunder but saw
Cohen's winds and raised his colleagues a cast of singers whose
English was nearly impenetrable, evoking memories of the 1951
Kirsten Flagstad recording. William Christie, in the first of his
two ``Dido'' recordings (Harmonia Mundi France), called
Harnoncourt's accented singers and Parrott's storm; in his second
``Dido'' (Erato), he called Cohen's single strings.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Pinnock (Archiv) passed on Cohen's added flute, but saw
his oboe and his male Sorceress, and raised him a bassoon and an
oboe da caccia as well as a full-fledged string section and an
artistocratic Dido in Anne Sofie von Otter.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Hogwood (L'Oiseau-Lyre) saw Pinnock's big string
section and got serious with the sound effects, raising everyone
(including Purcell) a thunderstorm that began (italics)before(end
italics) the Witches' scene and returned as late as ``Haste, haste
to town'' at the end of the subsequent scene.
</P>
<P>
   Parrott, who brought the storm to ``Dido'' recordings in the
first place, was not about to stand for such thunder-stealing. On
his remake, he sees Hogwood's early storm as well as the
recurrences up to ``Haste, haste'' and raises him some birds.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, birds. At the start of the grove scene _ just
after the violent thunderstorm conjured by the Witches and called
for by Purcell, and a few moments before the gratuitous one at
``Haste, haste'' _ he sets the idyllic tone of Dido and Aeneas'
country frolic with a few seconds of chirping.
</P>
<P>
   One of Parrott's colleagues is bound to follow this by recording
the ruffling of the unfurling sails and banners at the start of the
last act. When someone hits on the idea of ending the work with the
sound of Dido roasting on an open pyre, it will be time to cash in
the chips.

REPUBLICAN LEADERS IN HOUSE SHOW READINESS TO CONSIDER GUN
CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs first four graphs to strengthen and to update with
Republicans drafting package) (rm) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republican leaders announced Tuesday that
they were drafting a broad package of gun-control measures similar
to those passed by the Senate last week, and Speaker Dennis Hastert
predicted that at least some of the provisions would succeed in the
House as well.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert signaled his support on Tuesday for one of those
proposals in particular: mandatory background checks on all buyers
at gun shows. He suggested that he also favored some type of
legislation, like the sale of child safety devices with handguns,
to keep firearms away from unsupervised children. These measures
and others are being folded into a juvenile crime bill expected to
come to the floor of the House next month.
</P>
<P>
   Although the House has traditionally been more resistant to gun
control than the Senate, the remarks of Hastert and other
Republican leaders Tuesday were the surest signs yet that the House
would be receptive to new restrictions on firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert's remarks, like those of other Republican leaders
Tuesday, left open the possibility that the provisions the House
votes on could contain details significantly different from those
in the measures approved by the Senate. For example, some of the
leaders prefer a 24-hour waiting period for gun checks, as opposed
to the three days approved by the Senate. But Hastert was more
adamant than ever that a full range of gun-control issues would be
debated on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House will vote trigger locks, background checks at gun
shows and closing the gun purchase loophole,'' Hastert said in a
speech on the House floor. Closing that loophole referred to
Hastert's previously stated support for raising the minimum age for
handgun purchases to 21 from 18, a measure that goes a step further
than the Senate legislation.
</P>
<P>
   But even as House Republicans trumpeted their openness toward
gun control, House Democrats sternly questioned the sincerity of
that attitude in a series of news conferences that underscored the
intense partisan jockeying around the issue. Each party clearly
craves credit for any legislative action on gun control in
Congress, and neither is willing to surrender that prize to the
other.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats complained in particular about Hastert's pledge
to bring gun control to the House floor in the next three to four
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   They insisted on votes this week and plotted a variety of
parliamentary and obstructionist tactics _ none likely to succeed _
to try to force the passage of legislation before the Memorial Day
recess.
</P>
<P>
   Reps. Nita Lowey of New York, Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut and
Steny Hoyer of Maryland appealed to the House Rules Committee
Tuesday night to add several gun-control amendments to an
appropriations bill expected to come to the floor Wednesday. But
the committee's Republican majority denied that request, saying the
amendments were not relevant to the bill.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Explaining Democrats' sense of urgency, Rep. Dick Gephardt of
Missouri, the Democratic minority leader, on Tuesday called gun
violence ``a national crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And we need to treat it that way and move on it that way,''
Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats charged that Republicans were buying time so
that they could soften the provisions passed by the Senate and give
lobbyists with the National Rifle Association a chance to influence
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said they were simply trying to make sure that they
fashioned coherent measures and avoided the confusion that occurred
in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know emotions are running high,'' Hastert said. But, he
added, ``The nation's eyes have turned toward us, looking for
responsible leadership. We must resist the temptation to score
political points.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Hastert first indicated his support for mandatory
background checks for all buyers at gun shows, a measure the Senate
passed, and a raise in the minimum age for all handgun purchases to
21 from 18.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, he seemed to come closer to endorsing a requirement
that child safety devices accompany all handguns sold by licensed
dealers, though his language was a bit vague.
</P>
<P>
   Other House Republican leaders, including Rep. Tom DeLay of
Texas, the majority whip, have signaled support for mandatory
background checks at gun shows in recent days, a gathering drumbeat
for new restrictions that would have been unimaginable a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   More concretely, Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, the Republican
chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and Rep. Bill McCollum
of Florida, the Republican chairman of that panel's crime
subcommittee, announced Tuesday that they were grafting a broad
array of gun-control measures onto a juvenile crime bill in the
committee.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as a week and a half ago, Republicans had insisted
that, for technical reasons, gun control was not ``germane'' to
that bill.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Tuesday morning, Hyde and McCollum said that a revised
version of the bill would include mandatory background checks at
gun shows; a prohibition on gun ownership by anyone who committed a
violent crime as a juvenile; requirements on child safety devices;
a ban on the import of high-capacity ammunition clips, and
tightened restrictions on the possession of assault weapons by
juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   They said those provisions, to be discussed further in a hearing
on Thursday, might contain different details than analogous
measures in the Senate bill. For example, the Senate bill allows
three business days for the completion of background checks at gun
shows; several House Republican leaders favor a 24-hour turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   But Hyde and McCollum also called for new restrictions on
children's ability to purchase rifles and shotguns, a provision not
present in the Senate bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats think they have a hot issue,'' Hyde said,
referring to gun control. ``They think they can put us at a
disadvantage. They can't. It's our issue, too.''

UNILAB SHARES RISE ON NEWS OF ACQUISITION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TARZANA, Calif. -- Unilab Corp. said Tuesday it has agreed to be
bought by a New York investment firm for $565 million in cash and
debt.
</P>
<P>
   California's largest provider of clinical laboratory testing
services said that privately held Kelso &AMP; Co. will pay $420 million
in cash and assume about $145 million worth of debt in the deal,
leaving it in control of 93 percent of Unilab's common stock.
</P>
<P>
   Unilab stockholders will receive $5.85 for each of their shares,
a 20 percent premium over Tuesday's opening price of $4.985. News
of the proposed sale, which has already been approved by Unilab's
board of directors, pushed the firm's shares up 43.75 cents, or
8.77 percent, to $5.3125.
</P>
<P>
   The single analyst actively following Unilab said the deal is
probably good for the company, but that that price is questionable.
Nancy Weaver at Little Rock, Ark.-based Stephens Inc. said the
$5.85 per share offer represents about eight times 1999 cash flow,
but just six times projected 2000 cash flow. If Unilab hits its
2000 projections, the sale price would have to be considered cheap,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Unilab and much of the state's health services sector are
rebounding after nearly a decade of shrinking margins brought on by
the ascendence of managed care. Unilab has operated in the black
since the end of 1997 and has been on a buying spree of late,
acquiring competitors in Sacramento and San Jose in the last eight
months. The company now controls about a quarter of California's
clinical lab testing business, with 1998 sales of about $60
million.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such growth, Melissa Mahoney, Unilab's head of investor
relations, said that given the current state of the stock market, a
sale is the best option for shareholders. ``We're a small-cap stock
and don't get noticed much. You work really hard chasing investors
and analysts and have this great story to tell and still your stock
languishes,'' Mahoney said. ``This takes out the uncertainty (for
shareholders).''
</P>
<P>
   Unilab shares have traded in the $2 to $5 range since January
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the deal, Unilab will be merged with an existing
Kelso company, UC Acquisition Sub Inc., but will continue to
operate as an independent entity under its current name. Kelso
officials said they will then invest roughly $139 million in the
operation.

GANDHI RETURNS TO LEAD THE CONGRESS PARTY

   NEW DELHI, India _ Sonia Gandhi, the Italian-born heiress to an
Indian dynasty, made a triumphant return Tuesday as leader of the
political party that has ruled the nation for most of the last half
century and is now trying to regain power.
</P>
<P>
   Her followers, who came by bus, train and plane from across
India, cheered and chanted in ecstatic celebration.
</P>
<P>
   A combative, impassioned Mrs. Gandhi, who quit as president of
the Congress Party only a week ago after three party leaders
opposed her prime ministerial candidacy because of her foreign
birth, said an outpouring of support from the party's members had
persuaded her to withdraw her resignation.
</P>
<P>
   In a voice choked with feeling, Mrs. Gandhi, 52, staked her
claim to being an Indian patriot. The country adopted her 31 years
ago when she married Rajiv Gandhi, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She recalled the assassinations of her mother-in-law, Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi, in 1984 and her husband, a former prime
minister who was only 46 when he was slain in 1991. And she
witheringly noted that the same three men who now raised questions
about her Italian origins had only a year earlier asked her to head
the Congress Party, then in a slow dance toward oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I became a wife here, a mother here, a widow here, too, right
before your eyes,'' she said, speaking in Hindi. ``The greatest
daughter of this country, Indiraji, breathed her last in my arms.
Every drop of blood in me says this country is mine. This country
is mine.''
</P>
<P>
   She defiantly said she would not reply to those who have
questioned her patriotism. She was apparently alluding to critics
who have asked why she waited until she had been in India 15 years
before she became a citizen and suggested that she may never have
renounced her Italian citizenship (a charge her friends say is
false).
</P>
<P>
   ``The people will give a resounding reply to that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining her resignation, Mrs. Gandhi said she had felt
hurt and betrayed when the three men, who had supported her as
president of the party, publicly opposed having anyone other than a
native Indian serve as prime minister. They sought to sow doubts
about her loyalty to India in her followers' minds, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that this whole fight is mine alone,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the people who have flocked to her residence from all over
the country in the last week convinced her she was far from alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to come to know who my true friends are,'' she said.
``You have again revived my hopes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not let you down.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gandhi arrived at the packed Talkatora Stadium, where
hundreds of members of the All India Congress Committee, a national
body of Congress members, had been waiting for her for an hour and
a half. Thousands of her supporters milled around outside, and
everyone who entered the stadium was searched.
</P>
<P>
   Security precautions delayed her arrival. Congress Party
officials say the government has warned Mrs. Gandhi recently of
threats on her life. The Hindu, a sober, English-language daily,
reported today that the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, a Sri
Lankan rebel group, were suspected of plotting to kill her. The
same group was implicated in her husband's assassination.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gandhi, whose friends fear for her safety now that she is
in politics, did not renounce the possibility that she will be
prime minister if the Congress Party wins in general elections in
September and October against its archrival, the Hindu nationalist
Bharatiya Janata Party.
</P>
<P>
   The Congress members elected to parliament would chose the prime
minister, she said. She did not need to add that they would surely
pick her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now nobody will dare go against her because the grass roots
are with her,'' said Ajay Singh, a Congress assemblyman from the
state of Haryana.
</P>
<P>
   The rage of the audience against the three Congressmen who
challenged her was palpable. The three, led by Sharad Pawar, a
powerful politician from the western state of Maharashtra, were
expelled from the party last week and say they will soon form a new
political party.
</P>
<P>
   When a Congress Party official from Maharashtra, Ranjit
Deshmukh, added a respectful ``ji'' to the end of Pawar's name
while delivering his speech, shouts of protest rose from the
audience. No ``ji'' for Pawar, they demanded. Only when Deshmukh
called the three men traitors did the crowd roar its approval.
</P>
<P>
   The stadium, both inside and out, was strung with banners and
decorated with billboards. ``No Soniaji. No Congress,'' said one.
``For the Sake of the Motherland, Soniaji, Please Come Back,'' said
another.
</P>
<P>
   A larger-than-life likeness of Mrs. Gandhi, clad in a sari,
loomed benevolently over the stadium floor, packed with Congress
men and women dressed in khadi, the white homespun cotton that is
their usual garb.
</P>
<P>
   When she finally arrived on the stage, where dozens of
high-ranking Congress officials sat cross-legged on white pillows,
chants of ``Sonia Gandhi, Zinzabad!'' or ``Long Live Sonia
Gandhi!'' rocked the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   From the dais, she waved to the audience, and it waved back to
her.
</P>
<P>
   A parade of speakers then swore their allegiance to her, each
more extravagant than the last.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wherever your sweat falls,'' vowed Subash Chopra, president of
the Delhi Congress Committee, ``we Congressmen will sacrifice our
blood.''

GORE APPEALS TO HISPANICS IN HIGHLIGHTING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
PROGRAM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Sub to clarify 23rd graf) 
(Eds.: Upside down question mark needed before C in como) 
 
By ALAN BERNSTEIN 
and BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEBASTIAN, Texas _ ``Como estas?'' the vice president asked, his
Spanish pronunciation only a little bit off.
</P>
<P>
   Just fine, thank you, came the answer in English from some
residents of this mostly Hispanic farming town near the Mexican
border.
</P>
<P>
   They were feeling particularly fine because Al Gore had come to
their one-traffic-light hamlet Tuesday to highlight federal
economic development programs called empowerment zones.
</P>
<P>
   But as Gore began a two-day swing through Texas, another
question concerns the depth of support for the Democratic
presidential front-runner from Hispanic voters across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush is the early front-runner for the
Republican nomination partly because he carried out a plan in his
re-election campaign last year to show that GOP contenders can
appeal to Hispanic voters, capturing about 40 percent of the vote
in his gubernatorial re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Gore and the Democrats have the advantage of
traditional loyalty from Hispanic voters and the government
authority to deliver programs such as empowerment zones to
economically ragged, predominantly Hispanic areas like the Rio
Grande Valley in South Texas.
</P>
<P>
   After chatting with Gore in their front yard, Abelardo and
Martha Oviedo said they would vote for Gore if the presidential
nominees were Gore and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's just more into, like, the empowerment zone. Small
communities, you know,'' Abelardo Oviedo said of Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Oviedo, who works at a Head Start program funded with
empowerment zone money, said she enjoyed seeing both major parties
compete for the Hispanic support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great for the Hispanic voters, getting all the
attention and being recognized,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's trip had an official purpose _ meaning taxpayers pick up
the tab for the trip instead of his presidential campaign
contributors. As vice president, he delivered a speech to the 5th
Annual White House Community Empowerment Conference in Edinburg, a
gathering of empowerment zone participants from across the nation.
The federal government pours loans, tax credits for new businesses,
job training and infrastructure improvements into the zones.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's otherwise routine annual attendance at the conference
got a boost Tuesday with the added participation of President
Clinton, who flew here from Washington before heading to a vacation
in Florida. It was the first joint appearance of the president and
vice president outside of Washington since January, according to
Gore aides _ and the first since Clinton apparently irritated Gore
by telling The New York Times he has advised Gore to relax and have
fun as a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in his remarks to the empowerment zone representatives,
said he was leaving it to Gore to flesh out the details of the
president's creation of a new task force to improve economic
development in vote-rich Texas and California and the states
between them.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also got to announce a new White House policy assuring that
information from immigrants applying for government aid, such as
Medicaid, will not shared with immigration authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the president threw the policy spotlight to his
would-be successor with the national media out in force covering an
event aimed at Hispanic citizens' concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, it's a passing of the baton of sorts,'' said Joe
Garcia, former chairman of the Hidalgo County Democratic Party.
Garcia said Clinton ``is making the rounds to make sure those
alliances are there for Al Gore.``
</P>
<P>
   And Gore may need that help, particularly in Texas where Bush is
the rare Republican with solid Hispanic support.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia said Bush brings a number of advantages to the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is Spanish speaking, he comes to the Valley often,'' he
said. ``I can't point to a specific program that he (Bush) has done
that has been a tremendous benefit to South Texas. But he is
friendly, a great personality and does well with crowds.''
</P>
<P>
   The current Hidalgo County Democratic chairman, Ramon Garcia,
predicted Bush would not do as well as he did in his state race in
1998 because he has a more formidable opponent in Gore than Bush
did in Democratic gubernatorial nominee Garry Mauro.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Garcia said Gore's trip to the Valley was important if he
wanted the Hispanic vote. ``This is his way of saying, `I care,'''
Ramon Garcia said, noting that Gore is not as well known as Clinton
among Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo County, where Tuesday's event was held, is about 85
percent Hispanic. It is also the seventh poorest county in Texas,
with about 40 percent of the population living below the poverty
line.
</P>
<P>
   With the government business of the day out of the way, Gore
attended a reception of the Hispanic Democratic Unity political
action committee, and an empowerment zone fiesta late Tuesday in
McAllen.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Gore's campaign announced he had been endorsed by
15 of Texas's 17 Democratic U.S. House members. The only two
Democrats in the Texas delegation who did not endorse Gore were
U.S. Reps. Ralph Hall and Charles Stenholm.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's wife, Tipper, attended a Democratic women's lunch Tuesday
in Austin and touted her husband's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was scheduled to end his Texas trek Wednesday with a
campaign fund-raising luncheon and a forum on school safety in
Dallas, followed by fund-raising dinner in Houston.

DESIGNING FOR A WORLD THAT'S ALREADY FILLED  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 30) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   They say that anyone can nominate candidates for the Pritzker
Architecture Prize. May I propose Gae Aulenti? The great Milanese
architect has just broken ground for her first major project in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   She already has as distinguished a body of work to her credit as
any Pritzker Prize winner. Not incidentally, she is also the most
important female architect since the beginning of time. Think about
it.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Aulenti's current project, the San Francisco Museum of Asian
Art, is the most recent in a series of older buildings that she has
remodeled into art museums. The series includes two in Paris and
one each in Venice, Barcelona, Istanbul and Milan. These projects,
along with her stage designs, are the works for which she is best
known.
</P>
<P>
   Her work can be crudely termed adaptive reuse. It has also been
described as interior design, a loaded term that may help explain
why Ms. Aulenti has been overlooked by the Pritzker jury.
Traditionally, interior design, like interior decoration, has been
considered a woman's profession. Architecture, meanwhile, is a guy
thing: big, new buildings, designed from top to toe.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent decades, there's been a gradual shift away from
these stereotypes. Interior architecture, as it is sometimes
called, has become a specialty for many talented architects. These
include quite a few male-female partnerships, including Williams &AMP;
Tsien, Smith Miller &AMP; Hawkinson, Hodgetts &AMP; Fung, and Morris &AMP;
Saito. Stage and exhibition design are also fields in which
architects have produced inventive work.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Aulenti can now be seen as a pioneer in these fields. She
has helped gain recognition for the interior as a ground where
architects can explore issues of context, history, perception and
public space. In the process, she has developed new ways of
thinking about designing for a built-up world. For an increasing
number of her colleagues, architecture has become a Gae thing.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Museum of Asian Art will be housed in a
Beaux-Arts edifice in the Civic Center. The museum's collection,
now displayed at the de Young Museum in Golden Gate Park, includes
more than 12,000 artifacts, one of the largest holdings of Asian
art in the western world.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled for completion in 2002, the new museum does not easily
lend itself to prior appraisal. Ms. Aulenti's work is spare,
enveloping and experiential. It reckons with light and shade,
openness and enclosure, stillness and procession. But it is not too
soon to reflect on the meanings that the San Francisco project may
reveal about Ms. Aulenti's work as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   In an introduction to ``Gae Aulenti,'' a 1993 monograph, Ms.
Aulenti states the three principles that have guided her work:
analysis, synthesis and what she calls the prophetic capacity.
There is nothing startlingly fresh about the first two, but her
idea of prophecy offers an intriguing clue to what makes her work
distinctive.
</P>
<P>
   On the most literal level, it describes an architect's ability
to foresee a place where none exists, or a new kind of place on the
site of an old one. Beyond that, the prophetic capacity refers to
an architect's ability to see herself as part of a cultural
continuum.
</P>
<P>
   ``If cultural tradition is not something that one passively
inherits but something that one builds day by day,'' she writes,
``then this third ability must be an aspiration to create an effect
of cultural continuity, to construct its forms and its figures with
personal, contemporary content.''
</P>
<P>
   I interpret this to mean, in part, that architects face the
Proustian task of exploring the relationship between duration and
time. Calendar time and cultural memory are different, though they
may overlap. Thus, the gigantic clock that faces visitors entering
the Musee d'Orsay may be something more than a fortuitous relic
from the time when the building was a train station.
</P>
<P>
   It's a reminder of what Ms. Aulenti is up to. People go to the
d'Orsay not to catch trains but to catch up with themselves, to
glimpse the present through the medium of time past.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Aulenti's work has, in fact, been prophetic. No architect
has a keener vision of the industrial city's transformation into a
cultural matrix. None has worked more intelligently to bring that
transformation about. This is the great story of the d'Orsay, her
best known work to date.
</P>
<P>
   Itself an industrial artifact (in effect, the largest object in
the museum's collection), the d'Orsay train station had become
obsolete 30 years after its completion in 1900. The platforms were
too short for the longer trains made possible by technological
advance. For years it stood derelict. Perhaps it was always
destined to be the museum Ms. Aulenti made of it, an unforeseen
consequence of the lofty place to which industrial society elevated
cultural achievement.
</P>
<P>
   One sees that loftiness in works exhibited throughout the
museum, but at two points it strikes with comic force. One is the
model of the Paris Opera and the Haussmann boulevards that radiate
outward from it. Set beneath glass on the ground floor, this
display is a Wim Wenders moment. The viewer commands the aerial
view of the angels, deities and muses with which 19th-century
architects furnished the urban skyline as tributes to the life of
the mind. The Opera was their Apollo Space Program. Coming in for a
landing!
</P>
<P>
   Then, ascending to the museum's restaurant, on a staircase that
leads past the gear box of another huge clock, you go higher into
angel territory, and lunch amid the heavenly creatures of Gabriel
Ferrier's murals. With a glass of wine, you can look past Ferrier's
pompier style.
</P>
<P>
   The industrial society gave birth to these angels, but the
machines are long gone, sacrificed by the cult of progress that
once worshiped them. The muses have taken over the building. In
fact, it has been renamed for them.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Aulenti has been prophetic, too, in recognizing that a major
function of the post-industrial city is to hold opposites together
_ to collapse the dualisms permeating modern culture. At the
d'Orsay she neither avoids nor exaggerates the difference between
old and new.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground floor are few signs that we typically read as
modern. There are no white panels to stop the eye, no floating
partitions, no chrome-plated steel. The free-standing walls take
their spatial rhythm from the building's side arches but in no way
mimic their style. The walls are made of stone, a material that
evokes permanence, but their low height and mazelike organization
suggests the flexibility of a temporary exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In her redesign of the Milan Trienalle galleries at the Palazzo
dell' Arte, Ms. Aulenti renews a truce between neo-classicism and
Rationalism, Italy's warring architectural factions when Giovanni
Muzio designed the building in 1931. Ms. Aulenti's gallery
partitions, aligned with columns and windows in Muzio's building,
take the form of extruded columns. Their silhouette alludes to
Muzio's neo-classicism, but also derive from functional
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The projecting ``capitals'' house lighting, air-conditioning and
security devices. The partitions stop well short of the ceiling.
This emphasizes that they perform no structural function and also
reveals the industrial esthetic of Muzio's coffered concrete
floors.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, at the Guggenheim Museum in New York, Ms. Aulenti
staged an interplay between continuity and disruption. Enormous,
cantilevered chevrons plunged into the heart of Wright's sacred
void. On the ramp, the slabs that supported the chevrons
interrupted a coil that Wright had designed to evoke an ``unbroken
wave.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Aulenti's pointed shapes echoed the hair-pin braces in
the skylight of Wright's rotunda. And her composition, like
Wright's, was as much sculpture as architecture.
</P>
<P>
   I've seen only one of Ms. Aulenti's stage designs, for Rossini's
``Viaggio a Reims.'' As staged at the Vienna Staatsoper, where I
saw it performed in 1989, the production oscillated between the
poles of illusion and fact. Ms. Aulenti used the stage more as a
building site than as a framework for pictorial effects.
</P>
<P>
   There was a fixed set of white platforms and stairs, chairs that
one might see in a contemporary board room and screens for
projecting live-action video of the performers. The performers were
in period dress, but in Ms. Aulenti's straightforward setting a
viewer was more than usually conscious that they were opera singers
as well as characters. Her design was less illusionistic than the
theater.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation of the Week: Does Ms. Aulenti consult the ``I
Ching''? The Taoist yin-yang symbol occasionally appears in her
drawings. This symbolism casts her belief in prophecy in an Eastern
light. And it suggests that the San Francisco Museum of Asian Art
will be something special in her work. Here, visitors will confront
that most powerfully global dualism, East and West.
</P>
<P>
   The museum will be housed in the city's former Main Library,
part of the Beaux Arts Civic Center that includes city hall and the
Opera House. This complex is the Western tradition at its most
grandiose: imperial Rome by the bay. The relocation sets the stage
for encounters between the Western container and its Eastern
contents.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the building and its contents were givens. This is
also true of Ms. Aulenti's other museum projects. Should she be
given credit for effects that result from facts over which she had
no control? Including the fact that these remodelings are the kind
of commissions that have come her way? Or that they reflect
curatorial as well as architectural decisions? These are, after
all, accidents, or coincidences, the circumstances that arise in
the course of any professional career.
</P>
<P>
   But if it does its work properly, a museum of Asian art should
invite alternative ways of thinking about concepts like accident,
coincidence, circumstance and causality. Asian art is religious
art. Its esthetic qualities are inseparable from the spiritual and
philosophical outlook it embodies.
</P>
<P>
   A Chinese landscape painting, for example, is a product of
meditation. The painter goes out to a place and may spend the
better part of a lifetime trying to discern the nature beneath
appearances. The painting records the painter's quest for union
with that nature.
</P>
<P>
   Substitute culture for nature, and you gain insight into Ms.
Aulenti's approach. Her career has led her to contemplate
buildings: cultural fragments, pieces of the city in a dense,
contracting world. Then she has re-rendered these places through
contemporary eyes.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't a more urbane sensibility at work in architecture
today. Or as ``The Book of Changes'' might put it: the Receptive,
changing to the Creative. Sublime success. Furthering through
perseverance.

ASTRONOMERS ESTABLISH MORE RELIABLE RATE FOR UNIVERSE'S EXPANSION 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   After eight years of measurements by the Hubble Space Telescope,
astronomers think they have finally established a reliable value to
the expansion rate of the universe, the indispensable number
required for determining the age, size and fate of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   It is a number that scientists have sought ever since 1929, when
Edwin P. Hubble discovered that the galaxies are flying outward at
velocities that increase with distance. Estimates of the expansion
rate, also known as the Hubble constant, are fundamental to all
theories of cosmic evolution. But they have fluctuated wildly
between numbers that would put the age of the universe anywhere
from 10 billion to 20 billion years.
</P>
<P>
   By the new calculations, announced Tuesday, the universe has
been expanding for at least 12 billion years since its theorized
explosive creation in the Big Bang. Depending on the density of
cosmic matter and the possible existence of a mysterious form of
vacuum energy, the age of the universe could be closer to 13.5
billion or even 15 billion years.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers said they had 90 percent confidence in the
reliability of the basic measurement underlying these age
estimates. The number of the Hubble constant, they concluded, is
70, plus or minus 7. That means that a galaxy appears to be flying
away at a rate of 70 kilometers per second per megaparsec, or
160,000 miles per hour faster for every 3.26 light-years it is away
from Earth.
</P>
<P>
   A team of scientists led by Wendy L. Freedman of the Carnegie
Observatories in Pasadena, Calif., determined the expansion rate by
using the Earth-orbiting Hubble telescope in measuring distances to
800 stars of known brightness, called Cepheid stars, in 18
galaxies. Measuring the expansion rate was the telescope's top
scientific objective.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all these years, we are finally entering an era of
precision cosmology,'' Freedman said in announcing the findings at
NASA in Washington. ``Now we can more reliably address the broader
picture of the universe's origin, evolution and destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a decade ago, astronomers argued over wide differences in
expansion-rate estimates, which resulted in a range of cosmic ages
running from 10 billion to 20 billion years. The first tentative
results by Freedman's group, reported five years ago, seemed to
defy logic. An expansion rate of 80 yielded age estimates ranging
from 8 billion to 12 billion years, which made the universe younger
than its oldest stars.
</P>
<P>
   Freedman said in an interview that the lower value for the
Hubble constant, as well as the team's confidence in the research,
stemmed from an increase in observational data through different
methods and a careful analysis of possible sources of uncertainty
or error.
</P>
<P>
   Now the estimates by rival teams are beginning to converge on
numbers that lead to ages of the universe similar to or greater
than the ages of the stars. But the controversy has not entirely
ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to disagree by a factor of two; now we are just as
passionate about 10 percent,'' said Robert Kirshner of the
Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass. ``A
factor of two is like being unsure if you have one foot or two. Ten
percent is like arguing about one toe. It's a big step forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Freedman's adversary in the Hubble constant wars has been Allan
R. Sandage, also at the Carnegie Observatories. His observations of
distances to certain types of exploding stars have consistently led
to lower values for the Hubble constant, usually less than 60, and
thus greater ages for the universe, from 15 billion to 20 billion
years.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent science conference in Baltimore, Sandage, referring
to his own results, reported: ``At a 99 percent confidence level,
the value is between 53 and 65. The curves are going to intersect
in 2006.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirshner remarked, ``We are no longer talking about a real
conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   As Freedman and others observed, the margins for error in the
two sets of Hubble constant estimates are such that they are not
only drawing closer to each other, but are also beginning to
overlap.
</P>
<P>
   Michael S. Turner, a theoretical astrophysicist at the
University of Chicago, said the refined value for the Hubble
constant represented ``the first act in a grand cosmological drama
that's going to play out in the next two decades.''
</P>
<P>
   In the drama, cosmologists will be trying to answer some
profound questions about the amount and nature of matter
constituting the universe, the possibility that a strange form of
energy is speeding up the cosmic expansion, what was the Big Bang
itself and how will it all end. Uncertainties about the density of
matter in the universe and the existence of a mysterious energy,
called the cosmological constant, contribute to the wide range of
age estimates drawn from the newly determined value of the Hubble
constant.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Freedman, for example, explained an estimated age of 12 billion
years was valid even if the universe is relatively lightweight, as
recent observations suggest. If there is indeed a cosmological
constant, a kind of antigravity force acting to speed up cosmic
expansion, that would increase the age estimate, perhaps up to 15
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion and age of the universe were also subjects of two
articles in the issue of the journal Science that is being
published on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In an analysis of recent observations and other research,
Charles H. Lineweaver, an astrophysicist at the University of New
South Wales in Sydney, Australia, put the age for the universe at
13.4 billion years, plus or minus 1.6 billion. The estimate took
into account low values for the mass density of the universe and
the presence of a ``missing energy'' source like the cosmological
constant.
</P>
<P>
   In a review of ``the state of the universe,'' Dr. Neta A.
Bahcall of Princeton University and three colleagues noted growing
evidence that is ``forcing us to consider the possibility that some
cosmic dark energy exists that opposes the self-attraction of
matter and causes the expansion of the universe to accelerate.''
</P>
<P>
   Such findings suggest the future in store for the universe. It
will probably keep on expanding, almost to the point of vanishing.
As Turner of Chicago said, ``The universe will become a bleaker and
bleaker place,'' and as the galaxies speed away from one another
and the stars grow dimmer, ``in 400 to 500 billion years, we're
only going to be able to see a few neighboring galaxies.''

   INSTALLATION-ARTIST (Undated) _ Ann Hamilton, the installation
artist who will represent the United States in the 48th Venice
Biennale, which opens on June 13, is a slight woman. Dressed in the
art-world uniform, black pants and jacket, her salt-and-pepper hair
closely cropped, she is a casual, earnest person who occasionally
flashes an impish smile. But if she has the look of a pixie, she
also has a mind as imposing as an Oxford don's _ and much more
imaginative. Among the many honors on her resume is a much-coveted
``genius'' award from the MacArthur Foundation. Her works are known
for being sensory and cerebral at the same time. By Judith H.
Dobrzynski.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SHAKESPEARE-FILMS (Undated) _ The Shakespeare thing. Is it out
of control? Like lemmings, Hollywood's bankable are rushing to
throw themselves into the sea. Right now, Michelle Pfeiffer's
Titania, queen of the fairies, is flitting through Michael
Hoffman's ``Midsummer Night's Dream'' in starlit freefall. Soon to
follow are Jessica Lange's Tamora, vicious Queen of the Goths, in
Julie Taymor's cinematic ``Titus Andronicus,'' and Alicia
Silverstone as the by no means clueless Princess of France in
Kenneth Branagh's updated ``Love's Labour's Lost.'' The industry is
smitten, cranking out Shakespeare as if there were no tomorrow. By
Matthew Gurewitsch.
</P>
<P>
   CANNES-FILM-FEST (Cannes, France) _ The top official accolades
at the Cannes International Film Festival were awarded to two
intense, painful French-language films dealing with hard lives in
lonely surroundings. The Palme d'Or winner, the Belgian film
``Rosetta'' by the brothers Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne, offers a
fierce portrait of a young woman trying to eke out a living against
impossible odds. The year's other major winner, Bruno Dumont's
``L'Humanite,'' is self-consciously minimalist. Dumont's would-be
painterly, philosophical film watches a wide-eyed police
investigator respond to stirrings of evil and sexuality in a rural
town, where the filmmaker regards his characters as brutish and
naked in every sense. By Janet Maslin.

   &UR; DANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ROBERT-LA-FOSSE-DANCE (New York) _ On a recent Sunday, Robert La
Fosse of New York City Ballet prepared to put on the sleek black
wig, orange gloves and cape of the evil sorcerer Von Rothbart for
the final performance of Peter Martins's ``Swan Lake.'' A few days
later, the elaborate wig and makeup of Von Rothbart packed away, La
Fosse looked more like his wholesome, all-American self in
rehearsals for two of the three new ballets, collectively called
``Duke!'' and set to Duke Ellington's music, that have their
premiere on Thursday as part of City Ballet's program celebrating
jazz. By Susan Reiter.
</P>
<P>
   ANATASIA-BALLET (New York) _ Not many story ballets are based on
the lives of real people while they are still living. Yet the
ballerina Lynn Seymour recalls that she wasn't surprised when the
choreographer Kenneth MacMillan asked her to create the role of
Anna Anderson, the woman who for years claimed to be the Grand
Duchess Anastasia, a daughter of Czar Nicholas II of Russia, in a
one-act ballet, ``Anastasia,'' that he choreographed in 1967 for
Berlin's Deutsche Oper Ballet. The story of the mysterious woman
who thought she was Anastasia so captivated MacMillan that in 1971
he expanded the work into a eveninglong ballet for Britain's Royal
Ballet, which performed it in New York the following year. Now, on
Thursday, ``Anastasia'' returns to New York in the first of eight
performances to be presented by American Ballet Theater at the
Metropolitan Opera House. By Terry Trucco.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   AVERY-FISHER-PRIZE (New York) _ Calliope, Euterpe and Erato
looked out from the pages of the morning newspaper not long ago.
Daughters of Zeus, goddesses of the arts, photographically
rendered. Well, maybe not the three Muses but certainly violinists.
Their particular Zeus has passed on but left behind a patrimony now
called the Avery Fisher Prize. Women, when I was growing up, were
not known for having pockets, but those of Sarah Chang, Pamela
Frank and Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg are now each jingling with
$50,000. The big news about the prestigious and financially
attractive award is that the present honorees are all female. It
has not happened before. This same-sex recognition serves the
sociological concerns of the music world, though I, for one, can't
hear anything identifiably feminine or masculine in their playing.
They just play, which is, I hope, the reason they won. By Bernard
Holland.
</P>
<P>
   DIDO-RECORDINGS (Undated) _ When performers make new recording
alliances, they often start by revisiting favorite works. Ideally,
they do so for good reasons: their ideas have changed, or
scholarship has yielded new perspective on a work. Whatever the
terms of the new agreement between the conductor Andrew Parrott and
Sony, Parrott's second reading of Purcell's ``Dido and Aeneas''
(Sony Classical SK 62993; CD) is sufficiently different from his
classic 1981 Chandos recording, for better and worse, that he
cannot be charged with reduplication of the more cynical kind. By
Allan Kozinn.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   AULENTI-ARCHITECTURE (Undated) _ They say that anyone can
nominate candidates for the Pritzker Architecture Prize. May I
propose Gae Aulenti? The great Milanese architect has just broken
ground for her first major project in the United States. She
already has as distinguished a body of work to her credit as any
Pritzker Prize winner. Not incidentally, she is also the most
important female architect since the beginning of time. Think about
it. Ms. Aulenti's current project, the San Francisco Museum of
Asian Art, is the most recent in a series of older buildings that
she has remodeled into art museums. By Herbert Muschamp.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV-MARLO-THOMAS (Undated) _ ``That Girl,'' the ABC comedy from
1966 to 1971 ever so judiciously entertained the notion that an
unattached woman in her 20s might have the urge and the right to
lead a life of her own. As is apparent in nine episodes of the show
now on video from Anchor Bay, those were deep waters in 1966. ``If
women were single, they were `Our Miss Brooks,''' Ms. Marlo Thomas
said the other day, referring to the 1950s series in which Eve
Arden played a wisecracking high school English teacher (who rented
a room in an elderly woman's house, rather than really living on
her own). ``That Girl'' was Ms. Thomas's idea. ``I wanted to do a
show about a young woman who lived in her own apartment, trying to
make it, not divorced from her family, but who, like most young
girls at that time and today, still was related to her parents but
not programmed by them.'' By Peter M. Nichols.

<P>
   BEISTEGUI-ANTIQUES (Undated) _ The contents of the Chateau de
Groussay, the circa-1815 house near Paris that Carlos de Beistegui,
a Spanish dandy, transformed into a temple to grande luxe
romanticism during the Nazi occupation, will be sold on site in a
three-day sale beginning on Friday. Sotheby's is conducting the
sale in partnership with a Paris auctioneer, Poulain et Le Fur. The
2,416 lots are an eclectic procession of splendors: a Victorian
side chair made of crystal (presale estimate, $3,200-$4,900); an
ebony and bronze Louis XVI desk once owned by the
pianist-politician Ignace Jan Paderewski ($243,000-$324,000); a
lurid raspberry-pink-and-turquoise-blue Savonnerie carpet made in
1953 for Beistegui's Venetian palazzo ($13,000-$19,500), even a
pair of copper frying pans bearing the arms of a noble Spanish
family ($650-$800). By Mitchell Owens.

STARR WILL NOT SEEK TO RETRY MCDOUGAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: About 350 more words will be filed ASAP.) 
(mk) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kenneth Starr said Tuesday that he would drop all
charges against two women he had accused of hindering his
investigation of President Clinton but was unable to convict in
trials that ended in bitter setbacks for the independent counsel's
office.
</P>
<P>
   Starr said he would not seek to retry Susan McDougal, a central
character in his long-running investigation of Clinton's Arkansas
real estate ventures, and Julie Hiatt Steele, a more peripheral
figure in the White House sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   With the McDougal and Steele cases over, Starr is thought to be
near the end of his far-flung investigations, which began with
murky land deals and bank loans in Arkansas and widened to include
Clinton's relationship with a former White House intern, Monica
Lewinsky, that threatened to engulf his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Starr is still preparing for two trials against another witness
he has accused of being uncooperative: Webster Hubbell, a former
Justice Department official and Clinton friend from Arkansas who
has already served prison time on charges brought by Starr and
faces further counts of tax evasion and giving false testimony.
</P>
<P>
   And Starr's associates have said that the independent counsel's
office may yet consider whether to seek an indictment of Clinton,
either now or after he leaves office, on charges related to the
Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McDougal was acquitted in Arkansas on April 12 of
obstructing justice for refusing to testify before a grand jury
about the financial dealings of Clinton and his wife, Hillary, in
their pre-presidential life. But the jury deadlocked on two charges
of criminal contempt, and Starr's office was thought, until
Tuesday, to be mulling whether to retry Ms. McDougal on those
counts.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Steele's trial on four obstruction of justice charges ended
in a mistrial on May 7, when jurors in Alexandria, Va., pronounced
themselves ``hopelessly deadlocked.'' Starr had accused her of
making false statements that hindered an investigation into
accusations by Kathleen Willey, a onetime White House volunteer,
that the president made an unwelcome sexual advance on her in
November 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's decision brought expressions of relief and vindication
from the defendants and people close to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still kind of numb, but I'm absolutely ecstatic,'' Ms.
Steele said. ``I think he finally realized there was no case. I
didn't do anything wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Steele's lawyer, Nancy Luque, said, ``I'm extremely happy
for Julie and pleased that this decision was finally made.'' Ms.
Luque's firm, Reed Smith of Washington, had represented Ms. Steele
without charge.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Luque said the prosecutor notified Judge Claude Hilton of
U.S. District Court in Alexandria of his decision on Tuesday, and
that a formal motion to dismiss the case was expected this week.
</P>
<P>
   In the McDougal case, Starr did file a dismissal motion with
Judge George Howard Jr. of U.S. District Court in Little Rock,
Ark., telling the court it would be very difficult to empanel a new
jury whose views were not contaminated by extensive publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the April 12 outcome, Starr said in the motion,
``The unwillingness of some jurors to focus on the evidence and
follow the jury instructions weighs heavily in the OIC's decision
that a retrial in this district is not in the public interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McDougal's brother, William Henley, said that pursuing the
case against his sister ``would only have put my family through the
misery of a retrial. I think he did the right thing.''

EXTRAVAGANT FANTASIES A COLLECTOR MADE REAL  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 30) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Mitchell Owens is the senior interior design editor of Traditional
Home magazine.  
 By MITCHELL OWENS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stories abound of millionaires with surly tempers, put-on airs
and bad taste. Few stories, however, tell of anyone like Carlos de
Beistegui, an international dandy whose character flaws were myriad
but whose esthetic sense caused him to be widely admired as a rich
man who deserved to be rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly he was selfish, difficult and snobbish, which can be
said about many successful men and women,'' said Marcus Linell, a
senior director of Sotheby's, which is dispersing the contents of
Chateau de Groussay, the circa-1815 house near Paris that was
Beistegui's home from 1939 until his death in 1970 at 74. ``But
Charlie Beistegui was that rare thing: a rich man whose fantasies
were not only extraordinarily beautiful but who actually realized
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The contents of the house, which Beistegui (pronounced
Bay-ISS-te-gi) transformed into a temple to grande luxe romanticism
during the Nazi occupation, will be sold on site in a three-day
sale beginning on Friday. Sotheby's is conducting the sale in
partnership with a Paris auctioneer, Poulain et Le Fur.
</P>
<P>
   The 2,416 lots are an eclectic procession of splendors: a
Victorian side chair made of crystal (presale estimate,
$3,200-$4,900); an ebony and bronze Louis XVI desk once owned by
the pianist-politician Ignace Jan Paderewski ($243,000-$324,000); a
lurid raspberry-pink-and-turquoise-blue Savonnerie carpet made in
1953 for Beistegui's Venetian palazzo ($13,000-$19,500), even a
pair of copper frying pans bearing the arms of a noble Spanish
family ($650-$800).
</P>
<P>
   Allied to Beistegui's moody palette _ olive, sapphire, slate
gray, mud brown, pale blue _ these relics made Groussay and its
amateur decorator-owner _ a French-born, English-schooled heir to a
Mexican silver-mining fortune _ arguably the single most important
influence on late 20th-century traditional decoration.
</P>
<P>
   The sale's most fascinating souvenirs, however, are not what
Beistegui bought but what Beistegui wrought, often with the help of
his friends and proteges, Alexandre Serebriakoff, a Russian emigre
artist, and Emilio Terry y Dorticos, a Cuban-born architect and
designer.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a weakness for fantasy and a passion for building _
this talent turned into a certifiable mania in the early 1960s,
after a series of psychologically disabling strokes _ Carlos de
Beistegui littered the grounds of Groussay with a magically bizarre
assortment of exotic follies.
</P>
<P>
   Though the seven follies he built between 1955 and 1966 will
remain part of the estate, albeit stripped of their furnishings,
the drawings and three-dimensional architectural models depicting
them, the chateau and several unbuilt follies will be sold. Made of
handpainted wood and paper by Serebriakoff, the 10 models are
relatively intact, considering their resting place for the past
30-odd years: a damp basement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say they are in country-house condition,'' Linell
said, with a laugh. There is a tear in the paper roof of a 1964
model of the scarlet-and-gold chinoiserie pagoda (it was built on
an artificial island in an artificial lake in 1966) and a painted
wood column missing from the model of the Casino Marino (designed
in 1964 after an 18th-century Irish folly but never built at
Groussay).
</P>
<P>
   The models range from a 14{-inch-tall neo-classical arch
intended for the entrance to Groussay's flower garden ($650-$1,000)
to Emilio Terry's 1952 model of the creamy-colored chateau itself,
measuring 5 feet long by 1 foot high ($8,000-$16,000). There is
also a similarly scaled 19th-century architectural model included
in the sale, depicting an unknown public building in England
($3,200-$4,000).
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, though Carlos de Beistegui built for pleasure, the
pleasure was always fleeting. ``Once a project was finished, he
lost interest and moved on to the creation of some new
extravagance,'' said Linell.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly addled and dangerously close to insolvency by the
mid 1960s, Beistegui continued to dream up additions to his
personal theme park: a gothic pavilion, a round temple in the style
of Robert Adam, a gilded gondola for touring the lake. How many
follies the mad maestro of Groussay had up his Savile Row-tailored
sleeve may never be known.
</P>
<P>
   Linell said that extensive plans for a 75-foot-tall masonry
elephant were discovered two weeks ago, at the back of a cupboard.
</P>
<P>
   Not one of these later grandiosities was built (though Alexandre
Serebriakoff was kept busy translating his patron's daydreams into
exquisitely detailed gouaches). But one of Beistegui's late
architectural fancies nearly was. A series of watercolor and
pen-and-ink renderings, variously dated 1966 and 1968, depicts the
Bel Air pavilion, a three-story cottage wrapped in lacy galleries
like an antebellum steamboat ($2,400-$3,200).
</P>
<P>
   Serebriakoff prepared three alternative facades for Beistegui's
delectation: New England neo-classical, English Palladian and, more
amusingly, Garden District Camp, ornamented with New Orleans-style
urns, pineapples and busts.
</P>
<P>
   What remains of that particular dream, however, is a dispiriting
ruin, half-forgotten in Groussay's verdant park: a three-story
cinderblock carcass veiled by a tangle of towering sycamores. Two
years after its construction was begun and then mysteriously
halted, Carlos de Beistegui was dead. His fortune nearly depleted
but his legend was assured.

 &HT;    INDY 500 notebook

 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Arie Luyendyk has raced in the Indianapolis 500
14 times, and not coincidently he holds or shares every
Indianapolis Motor Speedway record.
</P>
<P>
   Among his records, the retiring two-time Indy 500 winner has the
fastest race average speed (185.981 mph, 1990) and fastest official
lap (237.498, 1996). And Saturday he tied Greg Ray for the fastest
official lap by a normally aspirated Indy Racing League car
(225.643).
</P>
<P>
   ``What I will really miss is the sheer pleasure of driving here
or any race,'' Luyendyk said. ``I'll miss the competition _ the
race most.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thrill is always there, but (Pole Day) was even more of a
thrill because of the way the fans reacted. When I came around,
everybody was cheering and waving the towels. It was a great
feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Luyendyk has started the Indy 500 in the front row five times
and is a three-time pole winner.
</P>
<P>
   Seven drivers have won the pole three times, including Mario
Andretti, Johnny Rutherford and Tom Sneva. A.J. Foyt and Rex Mays
won four poles and Rick Mears won a record six.
</P>
<P>
   Luyendyk is the 12th driver to start from the pole in his final
Indy 500 start. Bobby Unser is the only driver to win from the pole
in his final Indy (1981). Beechler bears down:
</P>
<P>
   That Donnie Beechler is in the Indianapolis 500 is a minor
miracle.

   Beechler, who drives for Cahill Racing, which is managed by
Dayton, Ohio resident Mack McClellan, was practicing Saturday
before Pole Day when his engine blew. Then he had a couple of
qualifying attempts waved off because his average speed wouldn't
put him in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were out there today and all I could muster is a 218 flat
out,'' Beechler said. ``We pulled out all the stops and stiffened
everything up. We even went to an option tire from Firestone, a
harder compound for speed in the turns. I thought if we could run
four 220s, I'd be happy.''

   OSUBI, Nigeria _ Palms swaying deferentially before him, J.R.
Udofia of Shell Petroleum strolled onto the tarmac to show off his
company's new $30 million project.
</P>
<P>
   Here was the runway, smooth, unblemished, open only a couple of
weeks, far prettier than most aging runways across this West
African country. There was Shell's twin-engine airplane, being
fueled and loaded with luggage on a recent Sunday morning, ready to
whisk away Udofia, the oil company's general manager in the western
part of the Niger Delta. Here was Udofia, like a proud father
beaming and avidly accepting compliments on a job well done on the
new airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please,'' Udofia said, ``this is an airstrip.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow it was a surprise to hear the executive of a company
that had just spent millions clearing bush in the Niger Delta to
build a runway, roads and buildings insist on this humble term,
airstrip. Commercial and government planes, not only those
belonging to Shell, will fly in and out to get to nearby Warri, one
of the two oil centers in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   So why not call it an airport?
</P>
<P>
   Only the federal government can build airports; everybody else
must be content with building airstrips, which have shorter runways
for smaller aircraft. So the Osubi Airstrip, named after the
village next door, has a runway that is officially shorter than the
1.24 miles that would transform it into an airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is officially a 1.8-kilometer runway,'' or 1.1 mile, Udofia
said, ``and based on that, the government gave us permission to
build an airstrip.''
</P>
<P>
   Underline ``officially.'' For at the beginning and end of the
runway are so-called stop-ways, each measuring 492 feet and pushing
the length of the entire surface to 1.3 miles _ 328 feet beyond the
limit. ``It is the federal government that can build airports,''
Udofia said with the indulgent air of a teacher instructing a slow
pupil. ``So in spite of how it is, it is still an airstrip, because
the official length is 1.8 kilometers.''
</P>
<P>
   Udofia smiled, a smile that conveyed the certainty gained from
years of experience that the impossible is often possible in
Nigeria, so long as certain illusions are maintained. Illusions
were necessary in a country where the federal government had grown
so corrupt over the years, so inept at providing the basic services
for its 110 million people, that individuals and businesses began
fending for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government first drew plans to build an airport here
in the late 1970s, but got nowhere. The president then was a
general named Olusegun Obasanjo, the same man who won the recent
elections and who is to take over as head of the new civilian
government in a ceremony in the capital, Abuja, on May 29.
</P>
<P>
   For the new president, the hardest task might be to persuade
restive Nigerians that their government can accomplish the simplest
tasks _ that instead of pocketing the billions of dollars a year in
oil revenues, the federal government will use the money to rebuild
roads, bridges, schools, a small airport, or put up traffic signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take Care. Dense Traffic,'' warns one of many green traffic
signs in Warri. The message is enough to make a passer-by believe
that a particularly benevolent and nurturing government is behind
it _ until the eye wanders to the bottom right-hand corner, where a
yellow symbol in the shape of a clamshell reveals that the sign was
put up by the oil giant.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, all the traffic signs in Warri were put up by Shell and
the other Western oil companies. In the absence of government, the
companies have increasingly been providing nontraditional services
in the Niger Delta, the source of almost all of Nigeria's crude
oil.
</P>
<P>
   In the hands of the federal government, plans to build the
airport here had languished over the last two decades in a mix of
neglect and corruption, said oil executives and other businessmen
in Warri.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, people coming in and out of Warri continued to use
the old airstrip, in a congested part of the city. Its runway was
so short that whenever a plane took off or landed, the authorities
had to close off an adjacent road to traffic so that a passing car
would not be clipped.
</P>
<P>
   Finding it harder and harder to conduct business with the old
airstrip, Shell finally decided to build one on its own two years
ago, Udofia said. And so Osubi Airstrip was opened to all flights
with a ceremony two months ago, although a permanent terminal
building, helipads and lighting to permit nighttime flights are
still under construction. Shell, which will operate the
installation, expects to recover the construction costs through
landing fees over five years.
</P>
<P>
   Half a mile from Osubi Airstrip, in the heart of the village of
Osubi, people were still talking about the new project.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Morodio, at 98 the oldest man in the village, remembered
how the initial plans to build the airport had filled Osubi with
great expectations. Delays, and even rumors that the location had
been moved to another village, had kept Osubi on edge for two
decades, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the airport was finally here and all the anxieties were
forgotten in this village of yam farmers, whose one paved road was
built by Shell. Wilson Jire, 72, even expressed greater ambitions.
With Osubi Airstrip's opening, factories would gravitate to the
area, Jire predicted, providing jobs for jobless youths.
Restaurants would open. Someone would surely build a hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope for a government hotel _ no, a Shell hotel, not
government,'' Jire said, laughing at his own mistake. ``government
is nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Milling around concrete market stalls recently built by Shell,
younger residents of Osubi recalled with pride the first time they
had visited Osubi Airstrip and referred to it as ``our'' airport.
</P>
<P>
   Venture Esi, 36, was born in Osubi but left for Lagos, Nigeria's
commercial capital, to study electrical engineering and eventually
worked there. But after hearing that ground had been broken on the
long-promised airport, Esi returned to Osubi two years ago with
great hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ties us to the world!'' Esi said of Osubi Airstrip. ``Our
name will be known all over the world!''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Esi was overreaching. Surely the world would be a lot to
ask for, particularly in a town with no airport but a mere airstrip
with a 1.8-kilometer runway.

US AIRWAYS TO BUY QUIETER PLANES AS PART OF SHUTTLE OVERHAUL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., N.Y., Va.)   (jw) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As competition heats up to win over the business
executives, politicians and celebrities who regularly fly between
Washington, New York and Boston, US Airways plans to announce
Wednesday that it will retire its fleet of noisy, 30-year-old
Boeing 727s and replace them by the end of the year with roomier
and quieter Airbus A-320s.
</P>
<P>
   The new airplanes, along with an expanded terminal at La Guardia
Airport, are part of a multimillion-dollar overhaul of the shuttle
that the airline is to announce at a Manhattan news conference.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways said the new, 154-seat airplanes were considerably
quieter than the 727s; the airline expects the new Airbus jets to
generate noise audible over an area 19 times smaller. Aircraft
noise has long generated complaints from residents of the densely
populated Queens County neighborhoods that surround La Guardia, and
from residents of Boston, Washington and Northern Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways' new airplanes will have wider seats and more
overhead storage space, and will feature an electrical outlet for
portable computers at every seat, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning this summer, US Airways also plans to spend more than
$10 million to renovate its shuttle terminal at La Guardia.
Commuter service that shares space with the shuttle will be moved
to another part of the terminal to make room for an expanded lounge
with fully wired, semiprivate work areas. US Airways also plans to
add jetways, a snack bar and a cocktail lounge.
</P>
<P>
   The investment, which counting new planes amounts to more than
$500 million, comes as US Airways, Delta Air Lines and United
Airlines are expanding their service in the Washington-Boston
corridor.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, the Delta Shuttle, which is the market leader, will
begin offering flights every other hour between Ronald Reagan
National Airport outside Washington and Boston's Logan
International Airport. In response, US Airways plans to fold its
existing hourly service between Logan and National into its shuttle
operation starting July 9. It also said that in the fall it planned
to convert its recently introduced hourly service from both La
Guardia and Logan to Dulles International Airport near Washington
into its shuttle operation.
</P>
<P>
   United, which has a hub at Dulles, responded to the challenge
from US Airways by adding its own hourly flights to La Guardia and
Logan from Dulles.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen months ago, US Airways bought the part of the shuttle
it did not already own from a consortium of banks that had
repossessed it from Donald Trump.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Delta flew about 60 percent of the 3.5 million to
4 million annual shuttle passengers.
</P>
<P>
   S. Michael Scheeringa, the vice president in charge of the US
Airways Shuttle, said it had since increased its share to about 44
percent.

RIGHTS GROUPS APPLAUD GORE'S STATEMENT ON IMMIGRANT BENEFITS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Civil rights groups Tuesday praised Vice President
Al Gore's assurance to legal immigrants that they can freely apply
for federal food and health benefits without fear of deportation.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, who heads the House immigration
subcommittee, expressed misgivings with Gore's announcement in
South Texas, saying the vice president has misinterpreted federal
laws designed to help indigent immigrants who do not impose a
severe financial burden on U.S. taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Many poor, legal U.S. immigrants have refused to apply for
health and food benefits, fearing their applications will be used
as grounds for deportation, said Hispanic and Asian rights
organizations. But Gore's statement _ asserting that legal
immigrants can apply for benefits without risk _ will alleviate
that concern, said leaders of the National Council of La Raza and
the National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium.
</P>
<P>
   The immigrants' apprehension is rooted in their confusion
regarding 1996 federal laws designed to reform immigration and
welfare, the groups said. These statutes have led immigrants to
believe that application for any public benefit will cast them as a
``public charge'' under the laws, putting them at risk of
deportation and denial of permanent residency, the organizations
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement, Gore sought to clear the confusion by
listing many of the benefits for which immigrants can apply without
jeopardizing their immigration status. These benefits include
Medicaid, Medicare, health insurance for children, immunizations,
testing and treatment of communicable diseases, nutrition programs,
child-care services, housing and energy assistance, emergency
disaster relief, foster care, adoption assistance, transportation
vouchers, education assistance and job training.
</P>
<P>
   NCLR Vice President Cecilia Munoz said Gore has removed ``a
major fear factor'' for immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``If immigrants are too scared to use these programs, then
eligibility is meaningless,'' Munoz said.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Narasaki, executive director of the Asian consortium, said
her group is ``very pleased'' with the vice president for removing
the confusion that she said has led elderly immigrants to tell
health facilities to delete their medical records, lest the
documents be used against them.
</P>
<P>
   The praise from immigrant groups was in stark contrast to
Smith's criticism of what he characterized Monday as a misguided
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans believe that immigration policy should bring people
to our country who will work hard and contribute,'' Smith said,
``but these rules will increase the number of immigrants on welfare
who will be able to bring in more immigrants to go on welfare and
are an insult to all Americans _ native-born and immigrant.''

SEMINIS TO OFFER SHARES IN JUNE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SATICOY, Calif. -- Backed by blue-chip investment bankers,
Seminis Inc. is planning to make a $250 million initial public
offering in June.
</P>
<P>
   The Ventura County-based producer of fruit and vegetable seeds
will be underwritten by J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Salomon Smith
Barney and Ing Baring Furman Selz.
</P>
<P>
   Seminis will offer 12.5 million common shares at an IPO price
between $20 and $23. After the IPO, total outstanding shares will
stand at 58.6 million. There is an over-allotment of almost 2
million shares, in case of increased demand.
</P>
<P>
   The issue will be listed on the Nasdaq National Market, under
the ticker symbol ``SMNS.''
</P>
<P>
   Seminis hopes to take in between $250 million to $289 million --
based on $21.50 a share, midpoint of the IPO price range, and
depending on demand for the extra 2 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   The IPO market is strong, said Jeff Stacey, chief operating
officer at IPO Monitor, a Calabasas, Calif.-based IPO research and
tracking company.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, six IPOs came to market, ranging from the wildly
successful debut of Santa Monica, Calif.-based eToys to Rubios, the
Carlsbad, Calif.-based restaurant chain. On Tuesday, the IPO for
Barnesandnoble.com rose 27 percent above its offering price.
</P>
<P>
   While Internet stocks continue to attract the most attention,
due to the recent weakness in this sector ``perhaps the market is
looking for alternatives to high-risk Internet stocks,'' Stacey
said.
</P>
<P>
   Seminis will use the IPO proceeds to redeem preferred stock and
pay down some debt. As of March 31, the company carried $443
million of long-term debt. Seminis is negotiating to get an
additional $350 million in loans.
</P>
<P>
   As a comparison, sales for fiscal 1998 were $428.4 million and
earnings from continuing operations were $6.8 million, according to
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Including the
purchase of old Class B redeemable common shares, net loss was
$133.4 million for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials, citing SEC rules mandating a ``quiet'' period
during which they cannot talk publicly about the offering, declined
to comment.
</P>
<P>
   After the IPO, majority shareholder Savia de CV will own 67
percent of the company and control almost 80 percent of the voting
rights. Savia will effectively control management, according to the
SEC filing.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Savia has used as collateral for its loans 48
percent (before the IPO) of Seminis shares. If Savia defaults on
its loans, the lenders can sell off Seminis stock and drive the
price down, the company warned in the filing.
</P>
<P>
   Seminis was created when several companies merged in 1994. The
core business was created through the acquisition of Asgrow from
the Upjohn Co. Later, it added Petoseed and Royal Sluis. These
three formed the company's full-line brands. With a total of 13
acquisitions in the past five years, Seminis also offers nine
specialty brands.
</P>
<P>
   Seminis holds 20 percent of the global commercial market for
fruit and vegetable seeds. It produces more than 8,000 distinct
varieties covering most species of fruits and vegetables. The
company sells to 120 countries; it has 70 research and development
stations in 19 countries and production sites in 32.

DICKS WARNS AGAINST POLITICIZING CHINA REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Saying that there is plenty of blame to go around
for allowing the Chinese to steal U.S. intelligence secrets, Rep.
Norm Dicks Tuesday warned Republicans against making political
mischief with the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Dicks, D-Wash., took particular aim at Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, saying that the presidential aspirant should be careful
because some intelligence losses occurred on his father's watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans need to be very careful, particularly George
W. Bush, whose father was a vice president for eight years and then
president when all this happened,'' Dicks said in an interview.
``People need to be fair here. This started in the late '70s, and
went through the '80s and into the '90s, and there were two Reagan
(administrations) and one Bush administration and they didn't clean
up this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor was one of numerous Republicans who
criticized the Clinton administration's handling of China Tuesday
after the release of a report by a bipartisan special House
committee. The report found that Chinese espionage has led to the
theft of top-secret information about every U.S. nuclear weapon.
China denied the espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Dicks, an expert on intelligence issues, was the top Democrat on
the committee, and along with the other Democrats endorsed its
findings.
</P>
<P>
   The report is likely to cause damage to two causes Dicks cares
about _ the reputation of the Clinton administration and the health
of China-U.S. relations. But Dicks said he believed it was
important to have a unanimous report to make it clear to the
administration and to Congress the importance of following the
committee's recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Dicks, who recently gave up his post as ranking Democrat on the
House Intelligence Committee, called the Chinese espionage ``no
doubt one of the worst counterintelligence failures in the nation's
history.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dicks, who was somewhat taken aback by the media storm that
greeted the report's release, spent Tuesday in a series of
interviews attempting, he said, ``to put it in perspective and keep
the balance.''
</P>
<P>
   He appeared on the News Hour with Jim Lehrer, Crossfire and
Larry King Live, and Wednesday he is to appear on the Today Show
and on C-SPAN's Washington Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Although Dicks praised the Clinton administration's response to
the report, he also acknowledged that he helped force that response
last fall. At that time, Dicks went to see Bill Richardson, the new
energy secretary, and warned him that the House committee was
uncovering a major scandal and that Richardson would be well-served
to follow any recommendations he got to improve his department's
poor counterintelligence operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can rest assured that we're getting this mess cleaned
up, and Congress and the administration are working together,''
Dicks said. ``There are going to be people who want to make
political hay out of this, but I think the American people are
going to be fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Dicks noted that, contrary to the expectations of some
Republicans last year, the committee did not find any impeachable
offenses by President Clinton, nor any concerns about campaign
contributions from China. But he said the Energy Department needs
to ``sanction'' some of its employees who hindered
counterintelligence efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Dicks said he is particularly worried about the report's impact
on U.S.-China relations. Like most elected officials from
Washington state, he is a major booster of the relationship because
of China's importance as a market for the state's exports.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a positive story for U.S.-China relations, and I'm
sure a lot of the people who don't like China are going to seize on
this,'' Dicks said. ``This makes it more difficult in Congress to
make normal trade relations permanent, and to accept China into the
World Trade Organization. It's going to complicate things in the
short term.''
</P>
<P>
   Dicks noted that the report follows an incident last month in
which the U.S. bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. The U.S.
said the bombing was accidental, but China has rejected that
explanation, and Germany has called for a NATO investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a good moment in U.S.-China relations,'' Dicks
said. ``But we need to continue to engage China and trade with
them.''

   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Ohio voters will likely be grabbing their
winter coats instead of spring jackets next year when they head to
the polls for the state's primary election.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio Senate on Tuesday voted to move the 2000 primary up two
weeks to March 7 with the intent of making the Buckeye state a
player in next year's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   The vote broke along party lines; all 21 Republican senators
voted to change the primary date and all 12 Democratic senators
voted against the move. The bill has already has passed the Ohio
House, but will go back there so legislators can make a technical
change. Once the legislation leaves the house, it will be sent to
Gov. Bob Taft who will sign it into law, said the Republican
governor will sign the legislation into law Scott Milburn,
spokesman for Gov. Bob Taft. , said the Republican governor will
sign the legislation into law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will become much more of a political player, (presidential)
candidates will come to Ohio early and often,'' said state Sen.
Gene Watts, R-Dublin. ``This legislation will increase voter
turnout and increase the state's status in the national election.''
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 primary is slated for March 21, but many in the General
Assembly said they are tired of Ohio taking a back seat to states
like New York and California in the presidential race. On March 7,
2000, California, New York and eight other states are scheduled to
have primaries.
</P>
<P>
   In nonpresidential years, the Ohio primary is held in May. In
1996, the primary was moved to late March for presidential years,
but Democrats say they want the primary held in May every election
year.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats predict colder weather, a shortage of poll
workers and confusion about the election date will keep more voters
at home next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters don't want to go to an election in the middle of the
winter,'' said state Sen. Dan Brady, D-Cleveland, before Tuesday's
vote. ``There is no question there will be less people voting on
March 7 than in May. If we really want to encourage people to
participate in the election, this is certainly the wrong way to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats cited the March 1996 presidential primary that had
300,000 fewer voters than a May primary in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans stood by their belief that Ohio's larger role in
the presidential election would draw more people into the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it comes too late, you must change the date,'' Watts said.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jurgen E. Schrempp, the man who reigns over DaimlerChrysler, has
a weak spot for trial movies.
</P>
<P>
   One of his favorites is ``Twelve Angry Men,'' in which one juror
painstakingly reverses the others' views on the guilt of a murder
defendant.
</P>
<P>
   To Schrempp, the tale is, at heart, a training film in
persuasion. ``It helps me put my arguments into words, focus on
people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The power of persuasion is a valuable commodity for corporate
chiefs hoping for a front-row seat in the global marketplace _
people like Schrempp.
</P>
<P>
   Orchestrating complex mergers across borders and cultural
divides takes a lot more than management skills _ it takes the
political knack to win over a wide range of people, often with
sharply conflicting agendas. And Schrempp, the intense German chief
executive who last year brought about the world's largest completed
industrial merger, may best exemplify this blending of skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Running a global, multicultural business is half stomach and
heart, and the other half is brain,'' said Schrempp, who started as
a mechanic, then ran Daimler-Benz divisions in South Africa, the
United States and Germany. ``You've got to see your goal clearly,''
he said. ``But you've got to deliver it just as clearly to clients,
employees, shareholders, politicians, labor unions, analysts, the
media.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, on May 4, 1998, three days before the world learned of
the merger between Daimler-Benz, Germany's largest company, and the
Chrysler Corp., Schrempp, 54, practiced what he preached in a suite
at New York's Four Seasons hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Pacing the room, he made his pitch repeatedly before a dozen
investment bankers, public relations experts and corporate lawyers.
Their task was to critique his soon-to-be-public presentation to
shareholders, the news media and the world _ until he had it right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, every company has many constituent groups,'' said
Gershon Kekst, who has been in public relations 40 years and was
one of that dozen. ``The publicity that is good in America is not
so good in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the era of globalization, the Internet and
multinationals has intensified the need for specialized skills in
communications. ``There are so many interest groups that can
disrupt the process,'' said John D. Bergen, president of the
Council of Public Relations Firms in New York, ``that public
relations now gets in on the strategy level.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor, of course, does the process stop with the merger. Ten
months after the birth of DaimlerChrysler, Schrempp was still
trying to convince his many audiences that it was a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Networking consumes 40 percent to 50 percent of my time,''
Schrempp said in March in an interview in Montreux, the Swiss
resort town. He had just returned from Tokyo, where he had flown
secretly to tell Nissan Motor executives that he was backing away
from a merger. ``Face is important in Japan. You have to do it in
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, he was still thrilled by the success of the initial
public relations campaign for the Chrysler deal. While the merger
has faced some rough patches, that campaign, by all accounts, was
second to none.
</P>
<P>
   The two corporate relations teams worked for months with three
public relations firms: Kekst &AMP; Co. and Golin Harris/International
of New York and Bell-Pottinger Communications of London.
</P>
<P>
   The work was supplemented with soundings from a few top
executives, friends of Schrempp, including James D. Wolfensohn,
president of the World Bank, and Sir John Browne, head of
BP-Amoco-Arco, who sits on the company's board, and influential
people like the Washington lawyer Vernon E. Jordan Jr., the former
Treasury Secretary W. Michael Blumenthal and former Sen. Sam Nunn.
</P>
<P>
   It emerged that the principal concerns included the need to
address the reaction of American Jews to Daimler's involvement with
slave labor during World War II, Chrysler's focus on diversity in
the work place, to which Germans are not as dedicated, and
employees' fear of being ``Germanized'' or ``Americanized.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the advice was bounced back and forth in private
conversations with three advisers _ Christoph Walther, who heads
DaimlerChrysler's corporate communications; Mike Taylor of
Bell-Pottinger, an old friend of Schrempp from his days in South
Africa, and Kekst, whose activism in Jewish causes was a plus.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a confidential 36-page plan that set forth every
detail with military precision.
</P>
<P>
   Drums rolled on May 7 last year when Schrempp and his
counterpart at Chrysler, Robert J. Eaton, made calls to President
Clinton and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl to tell them of the
merger _ the first of 147 big calls, including one to the next
chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   The message was tailored to the audience. To Kohl, Schrempp
described the merger as a great boon to Germany's largest company
and the country's industrial power. But the Socialist-leaning
Schroeder asked, ``But are you laying off any workers?'' To which
Schrempp said: ``I can give you my word there will be no layoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder went on to ask if the company would be German.
Absolutely, Schrempp assured him.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton, meanwhile, was implying to President Clinton that it
would be a merger of equals.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of slave labor was debated in a meeting on April 30
last year attended by Schrempp, Eaton, Walther and Kekst.
</P>
<P>
   Schrempp said that in 1986 Daimler commissioned a study on its
role in slave labor and published the results. It also erected a
memorial at its Stuttgart headquarters. Now, though, he knew that
would not be enough. A few weeks later Schrempp came up with the
notion of creating a compensation fund.
</P>
<P>
   Lower-level executives around the globe made 10,000 more calls
that day to unions, community leaders, managers and politicians.
</P>
<P>
   On the announcement day, Walther's team sent out 140,000
e-mails; letters and gifts like watches were delivered to all
428,000 employees of both companies; briefings for 950 analysts
were held in London, Frankfurt and New York; news conferences,
interviews and television appearances were conducted for 502
journalists on four continents; 5,000 videos were beamed by
satellite to television networks and thousands of champagne corks
popped.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time that day was over, we had spent $25 million,''
Walther said over breakfast during the Geneva Motor Show in March.
</P>
<P>
   Only so much can be done by outside professionals. At a certain
point, much depends on the boss. ``Ego does not drive the effort,
but they couldn't do it if they didn't have the ego,'' Kekst said.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   With Schrempp, the dream of bigger things emerged early. In his
12 years in South Africa, he developed a sense about the politics
of race and the price of ignoring human rights issues.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, he broke away from the technocrat-patrician posture
typical of German business leaders into a high-visibility,
contentious Anglo-Saxon style.
</P>
<P>
   After he became chairman in 1995, he made another splash by
warning that profits would be disappointing _ an implied criticism
of his predecessor's management at odds with traditional German
discretion.
</P>
<P>
   It was no coincidence that he hired Walther in April 1995 from
the tobacco industry _ no stranger to controversy and attacks _
just as he planned a painful restructuring that cost 40,000 jobs.
``If we ever sponsor a professorship, it has to be in political
engineering,'' Walther joked about his boss' style.
</P>
<P>
   Controlling and shaping a corporate image creeps into nearly
every corner of a chief executive's day. Schrempp's speaking
engagements, booked through 2000, are choreographed for the
``highest-leverage effect with the right audience, the right time
and the right topic,'' Walther said. Audiences will range from
those at the Detroit Executive Club to the annual World Economic
Forum in Davos, Switzerland, to top universities and various
foreign affairs forums. Carefully researched speeches, produced
mostly by Bell-Pottinger and the corporate relations department of
DaimlerChrysler, delve into car making, human rights and the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Richard J. Wolff, manager of Golin Harris/International, says
cross-border operations are creating a market for a new kind of
communications skills. ``That is beyond the commodity level of
public relations, the issuing of press releases and arranging
conference calls to journalists,'' he said. ``Look at Schrempp. He
is an international business leader. He needs to be surrounded with
professionals who are comfortable in history and culture, linguists
and thinkers with a broader sphere of knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Kekst and Harris employ partners with doctorates in
history, economics, accounting, marketing and law, and many have
been put at Daimler's disposal.
</P>
<P>
   In the sumptuous surroundings of Montreux and the success of the
initial phase of the merger, criticism was hard to ferret out.
DaimlerChrysler showed every sign of living up to the goals the
merger set forth: innovation, global growth, job creation, social
responsibility and equality.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last couple months, though, the equality goal has taken
a beating. The Americans have murmured ever louder that they are
becoming second-class citizens, and Schrempp has left little doubt
his team is first among equals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a German show,'' said one Detroit-based Chrysler
executive who insisted on anonymity. ``I guess it was inevitable.
Someone has got to run the show, but how are Chrysler's best ideas
ever going to reach Schrempp if they go through an exclusively
German filter?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, top Chrysler managers, including Eaton, have declared
themselves lame ducks, agreeing to leave in a little more than two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Some say the culture mismatch may make no difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two cultures don't even intersect,'' said Jerry Flint, a
longtime automotive journalist. ``They are not even on the same
planet. They have merged, but it doesn't mean they are making each
other's cars or designing or marketing or selling each other.''
</P>
<P>
   But this does not help morale and may, in the end, hinder the
merger. Some American executives argue that while mixing cultures
may not be a requirement, no doing so could brake Chrysler's lean,
dynamic, fast-moving style.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the executives say, they fear being hobbled by the more
deliberate, stodgy German process of management by consensus.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, a close confidant of Schrempp, insisting on
anonymity, said the German chief executive must sooner or later
tell people that he and he alone runs the company.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the heavy reliance on his charisma and the
positive vibes of the merger are coming to an end. To keep it going
now, the other Schrempp has to come out, perhaps swinging. &QL;

WOMAN AVOIDS MURDER CHARGE OVER DAUGHTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ When an Orlando woman chose to end her life last week by
removing herself from a life support system rather than spend her
life paralyzed from the neck down, prosecutors said they would very
likely charge the woman who crippled her, her mother, with murder.
But on Tuesday, the state attorney in Orange County said it would
be ``inappropriate'' to charge Shirley Egan, 68, with the murder of
her daughter, Georgette Smith, 42.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith, who was left paralyzed when her mother, Ms. Egan,
fired a bullet into her neck in an argument on March 8, sued her
Orlando hospital last month for the right to be disconnected from
the ventilator machine that was keeping her alive.
</P>
<P>
   She won that lawsuit last week. On Wednesday Ms. Smith was
disconnected from her life support system at the Lucerne Medical
Center in Orlando and died soon after.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had said they would very likely file murder charges
against Ms. Egan for causing the death, even though it was her
daughter's decision to end her life. A state court judge delayed
Ms. Smith's request to die for more than a day while lawyers
questioned her and gathered evidence in the pending murder trial.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday, the state attorney, Lawson Lamar, said Ms.
Egan's failing health, among other things, had made pursuing the
murder charge inappropriate. Ms. Egan's ``deteriorating health, and
her relationship to the victim, do not provide an appropriate
circumstance'' for a murder charge, Lamar said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith, whose spine was severed at the neck when her mother
fired a bullet into her after hearing that she was going to be
placed in a nursing home, had said she forgave her mother.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Egan's lawyer has said that she did not mean to shoot her
daughter and that it would serve no purpose to pursue a murder
charge against her. Ms. Egan had been charged with attempted
first-degree murder and aggravated battery causing great bodily
harm.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Egan, who also has respiratory problems and gets about
mostly in a wheelchair after a recent automobile accident, saw her
daughter the day before she died. She said she supported her
daughter's decision to end her own life.

 McKesson Cautions Investors About Profits  &HT;       
 By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Four weeks after it was forced to restate its fiscal 1999 earnings,
McKesson HBOC Inc. yesterday warned investors to expect further
revisions, as auditors continue to probe its troubled software
division.
<P>
   Shares in the giant drug wholesaler and hospital software firm
plunged $4.69 cents to close at $33.50 on the news. The company did
not provide any new figures, or say when it would issue its final
earnings statement.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's McKesson first acknowledged problems on April
28, after an audit showed that HBOC, which it had acquired in
January, had prematurely booked $42.2 million in software revenues
for the year ended March 31.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, the company reduced its fiscal 1999 earnings from
84 cents per share to 75 cents.
</P>
<P>
   That news sent the stock plummeting from $65.75 to $34.50,
taking $9 billion of McKesson HBOC's market value.
</P>
<P>
   McKesson HBOC spokesman Larry Kurtz said yesterday that auditors
have now found additional software sales that were recorded before
they should have been. He also said auditors are investigating
possible irregularities in accounting for sales of other HBOC
products and services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that there are in fact other contingent (software)
sales improperly recognized,'' Kurtz said, adding that ``other
financial statement items, in addition to simply software sales,
are now under review.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurtz said auditors have also extended their look into HBOC's
revenues back to calendar years 1996 and 1997. He said McKesson
HBOC hopes to complete its audit in time to file its annual report
on June 30. Its annual shareholder meeting is scheduled for July 28
in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Vietor, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, said yesterday's
revelation ``clearly raises the question about whether any number
can be trusted at HBOC.''
</P>
<P>
   The McKesson-HBOC merger was never popular on Wall Street.
Investors didn't see the wisdom of marrying McKesson _ which earns
razor-thin margins on its $20 billion in drug sales _ to HBOC,
which enjoys fat margins on just $1.8 billion in software and
service revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Pulido, who had been chief executive of McKesson before the
merger, retains that position in the new company. Charles McCall,
who had been chief executive of HBOC before the merger, is chairman
of the combined company. Neither executive has discussed the
situation publicly. Pulido works in San Francisco and McCall works
in Atlanta, where HBOC had been based.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Seelenfreund, former chairman and chief executive of
McKesson and currently a board member, is heading the audit
committee that is directing the investigation of HBOC. More than 30
shareholder lawsuits have been filed against the company.

 How to Give But Not Go Broke  &HT;

 &UR; Question: &LR;  I have a 2-year-old business that is starting to make
money and would like to start giving back to the community but
don't want to jeopardize the future of my business. Do you have any
suggestions for achieving the right balance.

   &UR; Answer: &LR;   &LR; Few businesses go broke by giving away too much. But
there are no hard and fast rules on what is appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies earmark 1 percent or more of pretax profits for
charity. But all the mergers and acquisitions and focus on
cost-cutting in the 1990s have taken a toll on business bounty. The
Conference Board reports that corporate giving has stalled,
dropping to 0.8 percent of pretax income in 1997 from slightly more
than 1 percent in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   One company that might be a role model for you and others is
fittingly named Give Something Back. The Oakland office supply
company has given more than half its net profits to charity since
its start in 1991 and was a finalist in last week's ``Most Generous
Company in America'' contest sponsored by George magazine and
Newman's Own, the company started by actor Paul Newman which gives
all profits to charities.
</P>
<P>
   Give Something Back co-founder Sean Marx, 33, suggests, ``You
should do what you can do without jeopardizing your business and
you should make it part of your mission.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Mike Hannigan, 50, started Give Something Back with the
intention of giving most of their profits to causes they believe
in, principally health and human services organizations. Their
bylaws state that the principals can earn no more than 80 percent
of the ``market wage`` for someone doing a comparable job at a
comparable size company.
</P>
<P>
   With annual revenues approaching $20 million and 75 employees,
Marx figures he and Hannigan could each earn about $160,000 a year,
but the two limit themselves to $72,000. Over the past three years,
Give Something Back has given away $551,342 of its $1.4 million in
profits, paid $479,825 in taxes and reinvested the rest in the
business.
</P>
<P>
   Marx says that Give Something Back is as focused on driving down
costs and improving service as any other company. It reduced
overhead 10 percent to 15 percent by requiring wholesalers to
handle all the warehousing and order packing and labeling.
</P>
<P>
   Marx does not recommend giving away more than you feel
comfortable with. But who knows, you may be able to build your
business by giving money away. Marx said his customers cite Give
Something Back's philosophy as a ``strong secondary reason'' for
buying its products.
</P>

<P>
   Retaining Talent
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Q: I run a small travel agency and find it hard competing for
talent in this tight labor market. What are some strategies for
attracting and holding on to employees?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; A: Small Business Success, a magazine published by Pacific
Bell Directory in partnership with the U.S. Small Business
Administration, focuses on employees as ``your most valuable
asset,'' in its latest cover story. Phone (800) 848-8000 for a free
copy.
</P>
<P>
   Its low- or no-cost employee retention tips include:
</P>
<P>
   _Offer an open management style with little bureaucracy to give
staff a sense of control over their own destiny.
</P>
<P>
   _After a tough project, give team members some time off.
</P>
<P>
   _Be flexible with work hours, dress, work rules.
</P>
<P>
   _Stop being petty. Rules for the sake of rules only anger and
frustrate people.
</P>
<P>
   _Try to make the work challenging or allow individuals to make
an immediate difference.
</P>
<P>
   _Stop micromanaging. If your employees are really incapable of
being trusted, you need new employees. If they can be trusted, you
need a new attitude.
</P>
<P>
   _Have fun. Throw a pizza party for no particular reason. Give
away family tickets to an amusement park.
</P>
<P>
   _Assign coaches or mentors to help employees not ony with
specific jobs but in developing their careers.
</P>
<P>
   _Consider offering an equity stake in the company to key hires.

 Bill Gives Phone Users `Cooling Off' Period  &HT;       
 By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
California consumers would have five days to change their minds
after ordering telephone services like Caller ID or call waiting
under a bill approved by the state Senate yesterday.
<P>
   Customers who order add-on services would get a five-day
``cooling off'' period in which they would not have to pay any
installation charges or fees incurred from using the service. They
could cancel without any penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which passed 24 to 13, would also require the state
Public Utilities Commission to create a system so customers can
compare prices between telecommunications companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill should make it easier for customers to compare
telephone services and should give customers specific rights to
refuse services they haven't ordered or felt pressured into
getting,'' said Debra Bowen, D-Redondo Beach, who authored the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation must still be approved by the state Assembly,
which begins hearing bills in June.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen proposed the legislation after hearing complaints from
customers who said they felt pressured into signing up for
expensive services from Pacific Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, customers who sign up with Pac Bell for services like
call waiting are charged from the day they authorize service. Many
of the services include a one-time activation fee. This bill would
give customers five days in which they could cancel the service
without paying any charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have `cooling off' periods for people who sign contracts
with health clubs, weight loss and dating centers,`` Bowen said.
``It makes sense to extend that same protection to telephone users
who are constantly being hit on and pressured to buy services.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials from Pac Bell said they were still talking to Bowen
about the bill and did not believe the legislation was in its final
form.
</P>
<P>
   John Britton, a spokesman for Pac Bell, said the bill's
``cooling off'' period is unnecessary because the phone company
already lets customers cancel new services within a few days after
placing an order.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody calls up a couple days after ordering a service
and says `We don't want it,' we'll let them out. We're liberal
about that,'' Britton said.

 CNN, IDG's New Venture Shows They're No Dummies  &HT;       
 By Dan Fost  
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Television for dummies?
<P>
   Cable network CNN and tech publishing powerhouse International
Data Group _ which produces the ``... For Dummies'' series of books
_ will launch a new consumer technology TV show as part of a $50
million partnership announced yesterday in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Although most of the deal involves advertising dollars, CNN also
will make an unspecified minority investment in a new, yet-unnamed
Internet company that IDG is forming.
</P>
<P>
   That new company could end up based in or near San Francisco,
where IDG already employs more than 500 people at a range of
magazines and online ventures, including PC World, InfoWorld,
GamePro and The Industry Standard.
</P>
<P>
   The forthcoming television show does not yet have a name or a
host, but it probably will be produced at CNN's headquarters in
Atlanta. It will compete with shows produced in San Francisco at
the Internet firm Cnet and at ZDTV, the cable network launched last
year by IDG's archrival, New York technology publishing giant
Ziff-Davis.
</P>
<P>
   With the CNN show, IDG of Massachusetts is taking a different
approach to broadcasting than Ziff-Davis. While Ziff created its
own national cable channel, IDG instead is lending its brand name
and expertise to one of the most successful channels on cable
television, CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Conlin, IDG president and chief executive, didn't mention
ZDTV by name as he noted its limited reach to 11 million homes.
``After a year of operation, the 24-hour television channel is not
at a level where it's rated by the Nielsens,'' he said. ``One
billion people are reached by CNN.''
</P>
<P>
   The 30-minute weekly show is likely to offer some hard news
about developments in the world of technology, as well as features
on Internet executives, stock market news, cool new gadgets,
favorite Web sites, and software and hardware reviews, according to
CNN Senior Vice President Rob Tolleson. It is due to premiere this
fall on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   IDG is a privately held company with annual revenues of $2.35
billion. It publishes more than 290 computer newspapers and
magazines and 700 book titles. Last year, it offered stock for sale
in its book division, IDG Books.
</P>
<P>
   It's also thinking of a possible stock offering for its
forthcoming Internet division. The company, which will run IDG's
240 Web sites, is being formed with the code name of Web IDG
Networks, or Project WIN, Conlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Although CNN's exact equity stake in that venture was not
disclosed, the executives said it represents about one-third of the
$50 million deal announced yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   IDG also will spend a similar amount, about $17 million, to
advertise on CNN's television shows and Web site, and the rest of
the money will come from cross-promotional ads in each company's
media endeavors.

SHARES AGAIN FALL STEEPLY
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks slumped for the fourth consecutive session on
Tuesday as a selloff continued in technology and Internet issues.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from a further steep drop in Brazilian stock prices,
traders had little fresh news to influence their decisions. While
the threat of higher interest rates continues to hang over the
stock market, bond prices actually edged up on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling that the Fed has moved toward a tighter stance
doesn't give people much optimism, and Brazil is not in great
shape,'' said Bob Gasser, head of U.S. equity trading at J.P.
Morgan Securities. ``But there is nothing on the horizon that would
have suggested we couldn't have rallied back'' from Monday's steep
slide.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, few analysts were willing to view the recent pullback as
more than a long-awaited correction, particularly in technology and
Internet stocks, which have been riding the crest for some time.
The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index has fallen just under
10 percent since its peak on April 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``This correction is largely a function of declining Internet
stocks,'' said Laszlo Birinyi of the research firm Birinyi &AMP;
Associates. ``The market is fine, but for the time being pressure
from Internet selling, both direct and indirect, and the fact there
is no news lets gravity assert itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology and Internet stocks that trade on Nasdaq suffered
most on Tuesday. Led by big declines in market favorites like
Intel, Cisco Systems and Yahoo, the Nasdaq composite index fell
72.76 points, or nearly 3 percent, to 2,380.90.
</P>
<P>
   Internet shares have been harder hit. TheStreet.com's Internet
stock index fell 26.35 points, or 4.6 percent, to 550.33. Since a
peak on April 12, the index has lost 30 percent of its value.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bad day to varying degrees in almost every corner of
the market. On the New York Stock Exchange, losers outnumbered
winners by almost 2 to 1. The Dow Jones industrial average declined
123.58 points, or 1.16 percent, to 10,531.09, while the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index dropped 22.25 points, or 1.7 percent, to
1,284.40. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks slumped
5.94, or 1.35 percent, to 434.45.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly hard hit were issues like Amazon.com, Ebay and
America Online. Amazon fell 5 15/16, to 111 9/16. Ebay dropped 19
5/16, to 163 15/16. And America Online declined 4{, to 115.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Cook, lead portfolio manager of the Munder NetNet Fund,
which has a little more than $2 billion in assets under management,
said profit taking, the threat of higher interest rates and a
supply of new issues were putting pressure on stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fourth and first quarters were particularly strong'' for
these stocks, he said, ``and 38 new names have come public since
the start of the year. And since these are high-multiple stocks,
they are going to suffer if interest rates move higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the weakness in Internet stocks was also a likely
catalyst for a drop in the Dow and the S.&AMP; P. 500 during the final
hour of trading. Investors facing margin calls in Internet stocks
may have been forced to sell Dow stocks to meet them, Birinyi said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Charles Schwab, Mo Shafroth, said: ``In the last
couple of days, when the Nasdaq takes a dip, it is often the case
that there is an increase in margin calls. I can't quantify how
much margin calls are up, but it is more than a little and less
than a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow was led down by weakness in cyclical stocks like Alcoa,
which fell 3{, to 56 13/16, and financial shares like J.P. Morgan,
down 3 11/16, to 133 1/16, and Citigroup, which dropped 2], to 62}.
</P>
<P>
   Intel led the Nasdaq and S.&AMP; P. 500 lower, falling 3 1/16, to
52~. Cisco was another big loser, falling 5, to 104].
</P>
<P>
   Bank and financial service stocks, punished on Monday after an
analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston put out a sell signal on
several money-center banks, were losers again on Tuesday. Bank of
America fell 2~, to 62}. First Union, which cut profit estimates
Tuesday for a second time this year, fell 4 5/16, to 45|.
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette shed 4, to 64|. And Charles Schwab
lost 9}, to 96|.
</P>
<P>
   Utility stocks, often used as a safe haven during times of broad
market weakness, did well again on Tuesday. The Dow Jones utilities
average advanced to a fifth consecutive record, rising 1.05 points,
to 328.48.
</P>
<P>
   Among individual issues, American Electric Power rose |, to 43
11/16. Con Edison gained |, to 49]. And Duke Energy rose }, to
60[. &QL;

 Venture capital firms investing in student startups  &HT;     By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
When Juan Mini and Scott Kucirek graduated from UC Berkeley's Haas
School of Business last Sunday, they had one distinction that
wasn't obvious as they walked to the podium in their caps and
gowns.
<P>
   Mini and Kucirek were the first Berkeley MBAs to get venture
capital financing while they were still in school. They raised $1.7
million for their online business zipRealty.com, including $1.2
million from Palo Alto's Vanguard Venture Partners.
</P>
<P>
   The pair marks the new breed of MBAs.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, only 1 or 2 percent of graduating MBAs wanted to
start out as entrepreneurs. Today, thanks in part to a booming
stock market for high-tech startups, 10 to 20 percent want to be
their own bosses, according to business school officials.
</P>
<P>
   And many aren't waiting until they get a diploma to start. From
Berkeley to Stanford to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
dozens of MBAs are already running businesses. And the venture
capitalists are right behind them.
</P>
<P>
   VC firms are flocking to campus to find and finance the next
generation of high-tech hits. Some venture capitalists are even
teaching classes part time _ a great opportunity to scope out
potential talent.
</P>
<P>
   VC firms are also sponsoring and judging competitions where
students with the best business plans can win thousands of dollars
_ and the attention of VCs with millions more to spend.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``Business plan competitions are really hot,'' said Mark
Gorenberg, a partner with San Francisco's Hummer Winblad Venture
Partners and a judge for contests at Berkeley, Stanford and MIT.
``I feel like a scout going to the Triple-As and looking for the
next Big League players.''
</P>
<P>
   The contests ``help foster entrepreneurship on campus and
encourage cross-pollination between business and other
departments,'' according to Gorenberg. That is important because
successful businesses are typically collaborations between people
in business, engineering, medicine and other disciplines.
</P>
<P>
   From UC to VC
</P>
<P>
   The first business plan competition at Berkeley's Haas School of
Business this year drew 75 entrants. Winners shared $10,000 in
prize money.
</P>
<P>
   The first-place winner, taking home $8,000, was Timbre
Technologies. Its principals, who met in an entrepreneurship class,
are Nickhil Jakatdar, 35, a Ph.D. candidate in electrical
engineering from India, and two first-year MBA students, Pedro
Abreu, 26, from Portugal and American Nick Sturiale, 35.
</P>
<P>
   The company is developing a cheaper, faster way to spot
semiconductor chip defects in the manufacturing process by
measuring the polarization of light traveling through thin films.
National Semiconductor is testing the technology and Timbre is
discussing its product with other chipmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many students are using class projects to build businesses and
get more out of business school,'' said Steve Domenik, a general
partner of Sevin Rosen Funds, which sponsored the Haas School
contest and is hiring Sturiale for the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the classroom, some universities are even setting up
free office incubators where students can turn embryonic ideas into
viable businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ZipRealty co-founders Juan Mini, 31, from Guatemala, and Scott
Kucirek, 33, from Merced, took full advantage of all UC facilities,
including free office space in the basement of the Bancroft Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Kucirek, who flew helicopters in the U.S. Navy, went to business
school because he wanted to pilot his own business. So did Mini,
who previously was a management consultant and turned around
Vecesa, Guatemala's largest bike company.
</P>
<P>
   The two met and decided to start a company that would let people
buy and sell homes over the Internet with the help of online
agents.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the free office space, Mini and Kucirek got
thousands of dollars of free advice from UC faculty and guest
lecturers such as renowned attorney Mario Rosati, a partner with
Palo Alto's Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &AMP; Rosati.
</P>
<P>
   Mini and Kucirek also enlisted more than a dozen classmates who
helped develop zipRealty marketing strategies as part of a class
project.
</P>
<P>
   At least seven other e-commerce businesses have been started by
graduating Berkeley MBAs. They include BusinessPlace, ClubTivity,
jSpan Corp., netRelevance, NoSilence.com, RedLadder.com and the
Utility Corner. Several hope to raise VC financing in the next few
months.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford Startups
</P>
<P>
   Student entrepreneurs have been around even longer at Stanford
University's Graduate School of Business.
</P>
<P>
   Meg Luttrell, 28, started a furniture e-commerce business as
part of a venture capital course assignment. After studying
economics as an undergraduate and working for an information system
software company, Luttrell sought an MBA to bone up on marketing,
operations and other business skills.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thanksgiving, she and two classmates _ Lillian Ho and
Pratima Rao _ decided what 20- and 30-somethings really needed was
affordable, well-crafted furniture that they could buy online.
</P>
<P>
   They honed the concept in a course taught by Sierra Ventures
General Partner Peter Wendell, and are now discussing VC backing
with several firms.
</P>
<P>
   Luttrell said they intentionally picked a made-up name. ``If the
business model changes a little,'' she explained, ``you don't have
to change the name.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bayla women are not among the 68 teams vying for $25,000 in
prizes to be awarded Thursday in the Stanford Entrepreneur's
Challenge. The business plan contest began three years ago in the
engineering school and now includes students in business, law,
medicine, biology and other departments.
</P>
<P>
   ``This started as a way to foster entrepreneurship among
engineering students who often had no idea how to get something on
the market or make a business of it,'' said Ted Acworth, a manager
of the contest who will receive his Ph.D. in engineering next
month. He figures that about 80 percent of this year's entrants
were multidisciplinary teams and most included MBA candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The finalists include:
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; ImaGen.  &LR; Rob Batchco, a Ph.D. candidate in physics, teamed up
with three MBA students to develop live, full-motion highway
billboards using low-cost laser image projection systems developed
in the physics lab.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; MusiCop.com.  &LR; Chief executive Erin Turner, who is earning a
master's degree in engineering, joined three Ph.D. candidates to
use computer algorithms to spot and stop Web sites that are
broadcasting pirated recordings. MusiCop expects to do this by
quickly comparing the digital signature of the broadcast songs with
original, protected recordings and sending cease-and-desist notices
to host servers that violate the law.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Tosk Inc. &LR;  Biology Ph.D. Patrick Fogarty cut short his
postdoctorate work at Stanford's medical school to pursue a venture
that he named after a mythological Star Trek creature.
</P>
<P>
   Tosk hopes to cut months or years off preclinical drug trials by
using specially engineered fruit flies to test the effectiveness of
new compounds.
</P>
<P>
   Fogarty, 32, has raised some money from friends and private
investors and hopes to tap venture capital firms for $3 million
late next year.
</P>
<P>
   Not every student entrepreneur is high tech. At MIT's Sloan
school, where business plan competitions have been going on for a
decade, this year's runner-up was an all-terrain skates company.
</P>
<P>
   MBA student James Page, 28, won $10,000 for Crosskate, which
looks like skis with wheels and can be used on hillsides without
snow. Each skate features nine-inch-diameter pneumatic tires front
and back, plus mountain bike-style brakes and a mechanism that
prevents rolling backward.

SUPERSTARS GRAVITATE TO A SUPER SCRIPTWRITER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 30)

   The Shakespeare thing. Is it out of control? Like lemmings,
Hollywood's bankable are rushing to throw themselves into the sea.
Right now, Michelle Pfeiffer's Titania, queen of the fairies, is
flitting through Michael Hoffman's ``Midsummer Night's Dream'' in
starlit freefall. Soon to follow are Jessica Lange's Tamora,
vicious Queen of the Goths, in Julie Taymor's ``Titus'' (a
cinematic ``Titus Andronicus'') and Alicia Silverstone as the by no
means clueless Princess of France in Kenneth Branagh's updated
``Love's Labour's Lost.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry is smitten, cranking out Shakespeare as if there
were no tomorrow. Tomorrow will come, though, right on schedule,
and with it the reviews and grosses. At which point, the text for
the day may well not be ``Once more unto the breach, dear friends,
once more,'' but rather ``Our revels now are ended.''
</P>
<P>
   In a review of the current ``Midsummer Night's Dream'' for The
Wall Street Journal, Joe Morgenstern wrote of ``the curse of good
actors inadequately trained in Shakespeare.'' He cited the director
Trevor Nunn, whose theatrical credits include innumerable
productions of Royal Shakespeare (not to mention the immortal
``Cats'').
</P>
<P>
   ``If you took the world's greatest Olympic athletes and gave
them all skis,'' Nunn said, ``then put them on the top of a
mountain and sent them racing down, only the skiers would finish
the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Do movie stars deserve Shakespeare or disserve him? It depends.
Plenty of critics and scholars continue to think of Shakespeareans
as a breed apart, distinguished not only by profundity but also by
a specialized technique. But in film, many technical skills of the
theater are wasted _ heightened diction, projection, gesture _ if
they are even tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare, after all, calls for (italics)real(end italics)
acting. From this premise, snobs draw the conclusion that stars _
outsize personalities, as opposed to character actors, the real
masters of their craft _ cheapen a classic, turn it into a circus.
</P>
<P>
   In the view of these detractors, personal magnetism is apt to be
at best a distraction. Shakespeare, practical man of the theater
that he was, might have disagreed. Charisma mattered in the
playhouses of Elizabethan London just as it will until our species
tires of watching players hold the mirror up to nature.
</P>
<P>
   Star quality will never put a capable actor at a disadvantage,
though in material like ``As You Like It'' or ``King Lear'' it will
show up a shallow one. If Laurence Olivier rose from commoner to
knight to a life peerage, it was glamour no less than his chops
that carried him so high.
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare's fatal attraction for filmdom's rich and famous is
not hard to understand. There comes a time in an actor's life when
the money and magazine covers start to pall and the inner artiste
cries for release. At moments such as these, Mel Gibson plays
Hamlet on screen for Franco Zeffirelli or Helen Hunt does ``Twelfth
Night'' onstage at Lincoln Center. ``Brush up your Shakespeare,''
Cole Porter advised, ``And they'll all kowtow.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, really? They did not kowtow much to Gibson's sweet prince,
though Braveheart-to-be got through the role with his figurative
pants on. They kowtowed not at all to Ms. Hunt's Viola, whom the
New York magazine critic John Simon hyperbolically deemed ``as bad
as it gets.'' They did kowtow to Branagh for ``Henry V,'' ``Much
Ado About Nothing'' and ``Hamlet,'' but that was different. Branagh
broke out as a Shakespearean long before he ever set foot on a
sound stage. He had paid his dues.
</P>
<P>
   Selective kowtowing is in order with the current ``A Midsummer
Night's Dream'' from Fox Searchlight, though not necessarily where
one might have anticipated. Kevin Kline, a classically trained
romantic lead with Benedick, Richard III and several Hamlets under
his belt, appears as Bottom the weaver, wooed by the fairy queen
and applauded in tragedy by a duke. He plays a dandy and a
philanderer, an irrelevant conceit that leaves the character's core
of poetic innocence untouched.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pfeiffer's classical resume is thinner, though her pastel
Olivia in the New York Shakespeare Festival's ``Twelfth Night'' 10
years ago did have fans lining up at dawn. As Titania, she presides
over the court like Tinker Bell on the last night of disco,
telegraphing rage and majesty by shaking her ringlets in time to
her lines. Calista Flockhart, a recent Juliet and Cordelia on
regional American stages, plays the masochistic Helena as Ally
McBeal less law degree: not just a flake but a year's supply of
Ivory Snow.
</P>
<P>
   Other performances in the film are more winning. Rupert Everett,
bare-chested, and Stanley Tucci, shiny of pate and pointy of ear,
make a wicked team as the king of the fairies and his sidekick,
Puck. Among Bottom's mostly irresistible cronies, two are drawn
with special felicity. Roger Rees makes a warm-hearted Peter
Quince, affectionate in his enjoyment of Bottom's shenanigans yet
able, in a pinch, to quietly take charge.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Rockwell's Francis Flute has surprises up his sleeve,
delicately modulating the suicidal Thisbe's lament from farce via
pathos to bittersweet comic resolution. As Hippolyta, the bride to
David Strathairn's saturnine Duke Theseus, Sophie Marceau expresses
through her French accent both breeding and a charge of resentment.
</P>
<P>
   Among the quartet of lovers lost in the woods, Christian Bale's
Demetrius stands out for a ferocity that erases the line between
tragedy and comedy: he plays not a genre but the truth.
</P>
<P>
   If the acting styles on view in this ``Dream'' seem to run the
gamut, a visit to the International Movie Database
(http://us.imdb.com/) suggests how narrow the band here actually
is. A search for Shakespeare turns up, as of this writing, 373
entries. To begin at the beginning, at the silent ``King John'' of
1899, starring Herbert Beerbohm-Tree, Shakespeare without words is
not Shakespeare at all.
</P>
<P>
   A few clicks bring you to Marlon Brando's mumbling Mark Antony
in Joseph L. Mankiewicz's ``Julius Caesar'' (1953) and Elizabeth
Taylor's no-holds-barred Kate in Franco Zeffirelli's 1967 ``Taming
of the Shrew,'' two of the more disarming examples of marquee
Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   And how about these items, ranging from the ridiculous to the
sublime? Kurosawa's ``Throne of Blood,'' based on ``Macbeth'';
Kurosawa's ``Ran,'' based on ``King Lear''; ``Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern Are Dead,'' Tom Stoppard's hommage to ``Hamlet'' (and
``Waiting for Godot''); ``Prospero's Books,'' Peter Greenaway's
narcotic fantasia on ``The Tempest''; Paul Mazursky's ``Tempest,''
set in Hollywood; another ``Tempest'' or two in the form of
``Forbidden Planet,'' starring Walter Pidgeon, and the Western
``Yellow Sky,'' starring Gregory Peck; ``Catch My Soul,'' aka
``Santa Fe Satan,'' starring Richie Havens as Othello; ``Quella
Sporca Storia nel West'' (``That Dirty Story From the West'') aka
``Johnny Hamlet''; a beer-soaked ``Hamlet'' from Rick Moranis
entitled ``Strange Brew''; ``Romie-O and Julie-8'' (don't ask);
``West Side Story.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The proportion of Shakespearean dialogue in the films on this
list ranges from not a word to quite a lot. But not one, it seems
safe to say, constitutes by any stretch of the imagination a test
of Shakespearean prowess. Shakespeare without Shakespeare's words
is not Shakespeare either.
</P>
<P>
   Cuts and transpositions are, of course, permissible. With
``Chimes at Midnight'' (1966), stitched together from several of
Shakespeare's histories and source material, Orson Welles made one
of the greatest Shakespeare films of them all, boasting battle
scenes that rank with Eisenstein's. The narrative centered on
Falstaff, played by Welles himself with a sly, deeply sinister
streak: a star performance, not a star turn.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne Moreau did a dubious cameo as Doll Tearsheet, the rumpled
Venus of the tavern, with an incongruous Parisian accent. That
fluttery old bird Margaret Rutherford added Mistress Quickly to her
gallery of classic eccentrics. In other scenes, John Gielgud's
dying Henry IV carried the banner for the Shakespeare of the Old
School, opposite the decidedly modern Prince Hal of Keith Baxter,
who was unmindful of the melodies of the verse.
</P>
<P>
   If, as few would deny, Shakespeare surpasses other dramatists,
it is not in the end that he differs from them in kind. His
imagination was richer than other playwrights', and took in a
vastly fuller range of experience. If others represent points on a
continuum, he represents the continuum in its entirety.
</P>
<P>
   His plays are at the same time the most naturalistic and the
most poetic ever written. An actor hoping to access all this with
some bag of specialized tricks will surely fail. What Shakespeare
requires is not narrow expertise but the most global experience
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Players who move back and forth from television to film to
stage, from Pinter to Euripides, from Shakespeare to ``House of
Cards,'' know this. Film stars whose turf is exclusively
contemporary, action or fantasy material may not. Accustomed to the
love-making of the camera, they see in Shakespeare above all the
tempting shell of artifice. As blind to the challenges as to the
rewards, they ape the superficial traditions of the classical
(read: ``British'') stage: elocutionary diction and fancy accents,
accompanied by gestures appropriate to the requisite wardrobe of
capes and crowns.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, they may, in the most facile sense, claim
Shakespeare as our contemporary, not bothering with accents or
fancy dress at all. Speech patterns that have not yet become second
nature defeat an actor, as do uncomfortable costumes, however
splendid to look at. As for odd clothes, these would seldom have
been a concern for Shakespeare's actors, who dressed as
Elizabethans even in a toga play.
</P>
<P>
   Grandstanding, however, was a temptation, then as now. Hamlet
speaks for Shakespeare in his familiar instructions to the
strolling players:
</P>
<P>
   ``Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you,
trippingly on the tongue; but if you mouth it as many of our
players do, I had as lief the town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not
saw the air too much with your hand thus, but use all gently.''
</P>
<P>
   In the movies, actors with the gift of being real will reach an
audience, even if sketchy training leaves them open to criticism on
technical fine points (the great favorite being niceties of the
verse). The 1995 ``Richard III,'' starring Ian McKellen, featured
Annette Bening and Robert Downey Jr. as Queen Elizabeth and Rivers,
a pair of stars impeccably cast as American-born royals by marriage
into a 1930s house of York.
</P>
<P>
   If Baz Luhrman's whizbang 1996 ``Romeo and Juliet'' failed to
make seasoned Shakespeareans of Leonardo DiCaprio, Claire Danes,
Paul Rudd and John Leguizamo, it didn't have to. The movie's
gangland Verona by the Sea gave the stars a place where
Shakespeare's language could shine as their own, if only for two
hours. Their ``swords'' were brand-name firearms, their
``messengers'' dispatched by the likes of Fed Ex. It was wild, it
was ingenious and it worked.
</P>
<P>
   No such transubstantiation occurred in Gus Van Sant's ``My Own
Private Idaho'' (1991). Keanu Reeves appeared as a rentboy who
periodically spouted lines of Prince Hal's from ``Henry IV'' to an
old lowlife who replied in lines of Falstaff's. What prompted their
little game? Who could tell? Still, Reeves' vacant delivery (and
gawky body language to match) lent the sequences an off-key, spacey
magic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lord, what fools these mortals be!'' Back in a more distant
past, you or I might not have thought of Mickey Rooney for
Shakespeare, which just goes to show that we are not Max Reinhardt.
In Warner Brothers' ``Midsummer Night's Dream'' of 1935 _ the only
sound film of that legendary Austrian theater director's career _
he cast young Master Rooney as Puck. Looking half his 14 or 15
years, Judy Garland's buddy whinnied his lines like a colt hoarse
on moonshine.
</P>
<P>
   More graceful, wittier and funnier still was the ex-vaudevillian
James Cagney, a bright-eyed Bottom who fit right in though making
subtler mischief on a higher plane. ``I have had a most rare
vision,'' he declared with crisp merriment, awakening in the
morning, released from the fairies' spell. ``I have had a dream,
past the wit of man to say what dream it was. Man is but an ass, if
he go about to expound this dream.'' A critic forced to describe
Cagney's performance could do worse than adopt these lines.
</P>
<P>
   Not for an instant was he ``doing Shakespeare.'' He was a
contract player doing his job, to transcendent effect.

   DAYTON, Ohio _ A national study to compare how well two drugs
prevent breast cancer will include about 250 Miami Valley women who
are past menopause and have a high risk for the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The five-year Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene (STAR) announced
Tuesday will include 22,000 women and 400 medical centers in the
United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Tamoxifen, long used for treating breast cancer, already has
been shown to reduce the incidence of breast cancer among high-risk
women by about half in research limited to five years and reported
about a year ago. But the women who used tamoxifen also experienced
a doubling of uterine cancer rates, a tripling of potentially fatal
blood clots in the large veins and lungs and smaller increases in
cataracts and possibly strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Raloxifene is a treatment for osteoporosis that also has side
effects, but does not appear to increase uterine cancer rates.
However, it has been on the market only for a year and a half, with
about five years of clinical trials, compared with 20 and 30 years,
respectively, for tamoxifen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are risks, but in my mind they're very small compared to
what this information will do for all the women out there,'' said
Judy Johnson, who will be part of the clinical trial. She was one
of about 80 women locally and more than 13,000 altogether in the
previous tamoxifen trial.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's high risk for breast cancer surfaced in 1991, when she
was diagnosed with a precancerous lesion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very scary,'' she said. ``You go along, happy-go-lucky,
working and doing all the things you do in life, and it all came to
a screeching halt. I knew I may not be here five or 10 years from
now. You think about your family, what you might be missing, and
you appreciate it all a lot more.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 50, was disappointed only ``for a fleeting moment''
when she learned she was among half the women in the tamoxifen
trial who received a placebo instead of the drug. ``But I did
contribute,'' she said. ``Without that, they wouldn't have had
anything to compare the tamoxifen to.''
</P>
<P>
   No one in STAR will receive only a placebo. Each participant
will take one of the two drugs for five years and be monitored
during and after that period. Neither the women nor their doctors
will know who is taking which drug.
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton Clinical Oncology Program (DCOP) wants to add about
50 women a year to STAR, which it will coordinate locally through
the eight private adult hospitals in Montgomery, Greene and Miami
counties and the Dayton VA Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's exciting about this trial is it's a means to find out
how to prevent breast cancer in patients with high risk,'' Dr.
Daniel McKellar said at DCOP's announcement of the trial's
availability. ``Most breast cancer trials have been about treating
people who already have it.''
</P>
<P>
   Raloxifene is marketed as Evista by Eli Lilly and Co. Tamoxifen
is marketed as Nolvadex by Zeneca Pharmaceuticals.

 &HT;    First Kosovar Albanians arrive in Georgia
 &HT;    By Christy Oglesby and Rebecca McCarthy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Just a few weeks ago, the Hoxha family fled the terror
of war, murder, and ethnic expulsion in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Today they will awaken in the tranquility of a Christian refuge
in north Georgia. Tomorrow, the schedule calls for English lessons
and grocery shopping.
</P>
<P>
   The humanitarian in Yugoslavia reached Georgia in a tangible way
Tuesday afternoon. Hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians have
fled the province of Kosovo. The Hoxhas _ two parents and three
children _ arrived at Hartsfield International Airport, becoming
the first refugees from the conflict to reach this area.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds more are expected to arrive in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   The Hoxhas stepped off the 737 from Newark into Atlanta _ and a
frenzy of media attention. But they seemed at ease answering
reporters' questions. The exception was 20-year-old Arben, who
nervously tapped his heel on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The trip _ from Kosovo to Macedonia to New Jersey to Georgia _
was ``long and very, very difficult,'' said Ilir Hoxha, the father.
``We would like to thank the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia, in terms, has opened its arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting more offers of help than we can use,'' said Don
Mosley of Jubilee Partners, an intentional Christian community in
Comer, Ga., where the refugees will live for the next two months.
``We really don't have any place to store any more help.''
</P>
<P>
   The family lived in Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, where Ilir
Hoxha musical producer for a television station before being booted
out of his job.
</P>
<P>
   `` It was a very hard life there,'' he said through a Albanian
translator. ``They forced us to leave our house. Every moment we
waited, our lives were in danger.''
</P>
<P>
   Also with them were two daughters _ Teuta, who is 15, and
Arbreshe, who is 17.
</P>
<P>
   After collecting their luggage _ new clothes given them at Fort
Dix, New Jersey, because they fled only with what they were wearing
_ the Hoxhas climbed in a van and were driven to Comer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a healing place,'' said Jennifer Drago, Jubilee's refugee
program coordinator who waited at the airport with a sign that read
``welcome'' in Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   The people of Jubilee had been preparing for this day. A
traditional home-cooked Kosovar meal of meats and dough was waiting
for the refugees, and staff at Jubilee had stocked their house with
familiar kinds of food.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a 50-pound bag of flour waiting for them,'' Drago
said. ``They do lots of bread. And there's yeast, fruit and
chicken. And vegeta _ it's like bouillon cubes. They use that to
season meats.''
</P>
<P>
   When the red van carrying the Hoxhas topped the hill near the
Jubilee driveway, Mosley began waving and smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Staff members and their families waved at the van and held aloft
a large sign saying ``Mire es na vini,'' the Albanian equivalent of
``welcome.'' The Hoxhas and their children shook hands with most of
the 25 or so people who live year-round at Jubilee.
</P>
<P>
   Ilir Hoxha, in an atmosphere less pressured than at the airport,
told of being pushed out of his home by Serbian paramilitary
members early last March. The three-mile route that his family and
he were forced to walk to the train station was lined with masked,
armed soldiers, but Hoxha didn't look at them. The family kept
their eyes focused on the ground the entire way.
</P>
<P>
   When the boarded the train, Hoxha said, they didn't know where
they were going of what would happen to them _they only knew they
would be killed if they stayed. They were dumped off the train
right inside the Macedonian border, where they slept on the ground,
in the rain, for seven days, with no shelter or provisions, before
moving into a refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
   Their frightening exit from Kosovo capped 10 years of oppression
and mistreatment by Serbians, Hoxha said. Fired from her clerical
job with a branch of the Kosovar government, his wife, Hyshije,
didn't work for five years, until she landed a job in the
University of Prishtna.
</P>
<P>
   By then, it was almost 7:30 p.m., and the Hoxha family seemed
tired, having been in transit most of the day. The meaty aroma of
the Albanian dinner prepared by the translator's wife wafted into
the parking lot as the Jubilee staff unloaded it from the van. The
family looked at the clear blue sky, the rustling trees and the
smiling faces of their hosts, then boarded the van to go to supper.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In glitzy, futuristic television advertisements, First Union
Corp. has been proudly promoting itself as ``The Mountain.'' But
the ground beneath that mountain is trembling.
</P>
<P>
   First Union, the nation's sixth-largest bank, which was built
through pricey, rapid-fire acquisitions, stunned investors and
employees Tuesday when it warned that profits for the second
quarter and the year would fall far below previous estimates and
that 1999 would be less profitable than 1998. It was the second
time this year that the bank, based in Charlotte, N.C., has had to
revise its earnings estimates sharply downward _ leaving the bank's
credibility in tatters, its financial outlook clouded and its
ability to remain independent in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years I complained about the prices they paid for
acquisitions, but I always said they ran a good bank,'' said Thomas
Brown, a money manager with Tiger Management in New York. ``But now
they're having serious problems running the basic bank _ the wheels
are coming off the cart.''
</P>
<P>
   The bank, citing difficulties generating revenue and looming
problems in its loan portfolio, said earnings for the year would be
$3.3 billion to $3.4 billion, or $3.40 to $3.50 a share. Those
figures are well below revised projections made by the bank in
January that caused bank stock analysts to lower their estimates to
$4.02 a share for the year, from $4.29. Last year, First Union
earned $3.7 billion, or $3.77 a share.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market was unforgiving Tuesday. In almost seven times
the normal trading volume, First Union shares plunged 8.6 percent,
to $45.625, the biggest drop in eight years and well below the
stock's 52-week high of $65.9375.
</P>
<P>
   First Union, along with its rival, Bank of America Corp., has
been one of the most free-spending acquirers in banking. Its
acquisition spree has contributed to a merger boom that has put the
bulk of the country's banking assets at a handful of banks with
national ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   So heated is the competition between First Union's chief
executive, Edward Crutchfield Jr., and Bank of America's chief
executive, Hugh McColl Jr., that each appears to be trying to outdo
the other with ever bigger purchases. Their rivalry even extends to
dueling skyscrapers. First Union is building a 30-story office
tower in Charlotte and has hinted that a 100-story tower may be on
the way. Bank of America is busy erecting a 45-story skyscraper in
Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   But the towering First Union facade cloaks a failure to attain
the financial goals promised in its merger binge, mounting
managerial woes and low morale amid the layoff of thousands of
workers _ layoffs deemed necessary for the bank to meet earnings
goals associated with acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   First Union's $17 billion takeover of Corestates Financial Corp.
last year was one of the most expensive in banking history relative
to the size of the target. First Union acknowledged Tuesday that a
financial payoff from that merger ``lags original expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, First Union also bought Money Store Inc., which lends
to people with troubled credit histories, for $2.1 billion. In a
maneuver criticized by many stock analysts, First Union later took
a $2.2 billion ``accounting adjustment'' for the takeover that
allowed it to spread the cost of the acquisition over 25 years and
thus avoid an earnings hit. First Union said Tuesday that the Money
Store acquisition had also disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, until earlier this year many analysts were willing
to give First Union the benefit of the doubt and accept earnings
projections proffered by the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tale of ego run amok,'' Brown said, ``and it says a
lot about how easily Wall Street buys into whatever earnings
figures management feeds it.'' He was referring to the ego of
Crutchfield, who once derided Brown as ``that little red-haired
boy'' and banned the stock analyst from company headquarters
because of Brown's skepticism about First Union's acquisition
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts were also critical Tuesday of First Union's
performance. ``This company has squandered its credibility with
Wall Street,'' said David Berry at Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods Inc.
``You cannot escape the conclusion that they have trouble doing
budgets over there.''
</P>
<P>
   A First Union spokeswoman said Crutchfield was taking questions
only from analysts Tuesday and declined to be interviewed. But
analysts said he had told them in a conference call that the bank
would now forgo acquisitions because they no longer made economic
sense. But the hunter could become the hunted with Wells Fargo &AMP;
Co., Bank One Corp. or Chase Manhattan Corp. eventually putting the
depressed stock of First Union in their sights.
</P>
<P>
   John Georgius, First Union's president, said in an interview
that his job was secure. He said First Union's board had supported
every acquisition and was ``very confident that our business
fundamentals are solid.'' He also said his bank had had ``many
years of consistent performance'' and planned to meet its revised
earnings projections.
</P>
<P>
   Though First Union said it would add $90 million to $110 million
to its loan loss reserves of $600 million, Georgius noted that that
figure was still relatively small given the bank's $130 billion
loan portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraging investors and analysts to look on the bright side,
First Union made one surprising announcement Tuesday. The bank,
which has invested so heavily in brick and mortar branches through
its acquisitions, said that its best opportunities for growth would
be on the Internet.

WALL STREET STAR-STRUCK OVER HOLLYWOOD OUTFITTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. -- Wall Street is starting to fall in love with
Hollywood rental-equipment specialist Matthews Studio Group.
</P>
<P>
   The Burbank-based company, which has taken advantage of Internet
fever this year by announcing plans for a comprehensive Web site,
saw its stock close at three consecutive all-time highs last week
in a breathtaking 38 percent sprint from $7 to $9.6975. It jumped
to $10.875 Monday after announcing a long-term outsourcing
agreement with Raleigh Studios before profit-taking led to a
25-cent decline. On Tuesday, it gained 12.5 cents to $9.5625.
</P>
<P>
   Those figures are stratospheric compared with stock prices from
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matthews had been one of those hidden little gems that's been
discovered,'' said Peter Cardillo, chief investment strategist at
New York-based Westfalia Investments. ``We still have a long-term
`strong buy' rating. It could go all the way to $18 a share.''
</P>
<P>
   The run-up began in late December when Matthews announced strong
quarterly results and accelerated in January when it rolled out
plans for ShowbizMart.com as a one-stop Web site for producers,
suppliers, crews and equipment. The company, which will formally
launch the site next week, has signed partnership deals with
Amazon.com, Reel.com and Sabre Group's Travelocity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the stock is on a roll and the Internet site is the
sizzle behind it,'' Cardillo said. ``There's a tremendous potential
for revenue growth. Things are still a little soft in the
rental-supply business but when that turns around, it's going to be
incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthews began buying up rivals in 1995 to become the rental
industry's leader and to diversify beyond the volatile feature film
business. It sold off its manufacturing subsidiary late last year
and operates in 14 locations with 400 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Although Matthews reported last week a loss of $3.5 million in
its six months ended March 31, investors focused on a 22 percent
gain in cash flow to $5.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos De Mattos, chairman and chief executive officer, said
broadening Matthews into supplying equipment to special events,
Broadway shows, Las Vegas casino shows and TV specials has made the
company less susceptible to Hollywood's tightened feature film
spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``The diversification has made us more predictable for Wall
Street,'' he said. ``We think features will stay soft for a while
but we are prepared to cope.''
</P>
<P>
   De Mattos said the Web site will enable Matthews to capitalize
on its fundamental strengths along with moving into the consumer
market by selling memorabilia through deals with studios and TV
shows. It also plans to use the site to auction off used equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Bret Weeks, director of marketing, said ShowbizMart.com has
provoked strong positive reaction within the industry. ``We're
seeing more response from majors and indies in our core business,''
he said.

 &HT;    Commissioners vote down West Georgia Indian casino
 &HT;    By Jennifer Brett and Ralph Ellis
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Carroll County Board of Commissioners on Tuesday
voted unanimously to turn down an Indian tribe's proposal to build
a Las Vegas-style casino off I-20 near the Alabama state line.
</P>
<P>
   The vote came before a crowd of about 250, with another 350
vocal opponents outside, in the courthouse parking lot chanting,
``No casinos! No Casinos!''
</P>
<P>
   Marc Curlee, pastor of Kansas Baptist Church, led a prayer of
thanks after the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a conviction that gambling is wrong. Legitimate
business is win-win: gambling is a win-lose situation,'' Curlee
said.
</P>
<P>
   County Commsiionion Chairman Jack Bell said early support from
some area representatives, based on the potential economic gain to
the county, was withdrawn in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will go somewhere else. Someone will accept this, and it
will be a boon to that county,'' Bell said after the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The Oklahoma businessman who wants to help the Kialegee Indians
develop the casino resort, said the tribe, which was forcibly
relocated from Georgia to Oklahoma in the 1830s, is willing to give
state and local government 25 percent of its game machine winnings
from the first 10 years of operation.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Baldwin of the Baldwin Investment Group, the sole
proponent to speak in favor of the casino complex, said that
amounts to about $1 billion, with Carroll County receiving about
$275 million over the 10 years. Baldwin said he wanted to try to
raise the money to build the casino.
</P>
<P>
   The casino and its 350-room hotel, golf course and other
attractions could provide about 11,000 jobs and pump $62 million
into the economy during the two-year construction phase alone. He
predicted the economic benefits would continue for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin's pitch to the Rotary Club of Carrollton on Tuesday
didn't appear to sway many members. Ward Pafford, president
emeritus of State University of West Georgia, said he is
``viscerally opposed'' to the casino.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all economics,'' he said. ``There are values other than
economics we must think about.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal law requires the tribe or its developers to discuss the
project with state and local authorities. Gov. Roy Barnes on
Tuesday reiterated his opposition to the casino.
</P>
<P>
   ``Casino gambling is not a productive addition to the economy,
long term,'' Barnes said. ``We think it has more negatives than it
has positives.''
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin and his Atlanta-based spokesman, Winston Leavell, said
they want local and state cooperation, but don't necessarily have
to have it. Baldwin said they can appeal local and state opposition
through a lawsuit, get approval from the Bureau of Indian Affairs
and end up building the casino anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the legal right to proceed with this project whether
the governor likes it or not,'' Baldwin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a deal killer in the true sense of the word,''
Leavell said.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin said the tribe, along with most other Georgia Indians,
were forcibly relocated to Oklahoma in the 1830s. The tribe doesn't
have its own reservation, but has a ``tribal town'' on a Creek
Indian reservation.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law allows the tribe to set up a reservation if it can
buy land in its ancestral homeland. That area covers most of
Georgia and the east part of Alabama, Baldwin said.

 WASHINGTON: right thing.''   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The McDougal and Steele cases presented public relations
problems, as well as courtroom ones, for the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McDougal became a familiar and unsettling sight as she was
led in shackles from jail to courthouse while serving 18 months for
contempt of court for refusing to cooperate with Starr, who she
said was punishing her for refusing to give testimony that
dovetailed with his theory of the case. Ms. McDougal was convicted
on earlier charges related to the Arkansas deals, as was her late
husband, James McDougal.
</P>
<P>
   Starr told the court Tuesday that a juror who talked to his
office said several members of the panel had simply refused to
follow the judge's instructions during deliberations, and that
``years of extensive press coverage'' may have swayed their views
in any event.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Steele, a single mother with an adopted son, seemed to some
observers an unimportant and unwilling participant in the
sex-scandal investigation. Had she been convicted, she could have
faced 35 years in prison and $1 million in fines.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution maintained that Ms. Steele undercut the
investigation of Ms. Willey's accusations by offering varying
accounts of what Ms. Willey, a longtime friend, told her of her
supposed encounter with the president. The differing accounts
discouraged Starr from including the Willey matter in the material
he sent to the House of Representatives as part of his impeachment
case against the president.

CABLE DEAL FOR $3.6 BILLION IN THE WORKS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Calif., Mo., Ore.)   (jw) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Charter Communications Inc., the cable-television
operator owned by Paul Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft Corp., is
expected to announce as early as Wednesday that it is buying the
cable assets of Falcon Cable Holdings of Los Angeles in a stock
swap valued at more than $3.6 billion, according to people close to
the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at both companies have been in talks for only a few
weeks, these people said. Allen is also negotiating to acquire the
assets of two other smaller cable companies.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of Falcon's cable assets would be the latest in
a springtime spree of deal-making by Allen. Charter has committed
itself to $3.7 billion in cable purchases this year alone,
including last week's announcement that it would agree to buy
Avalon Cable Television for $845 million.
</P>
<P>
   In buying the assets of closely held Falcon, Charter, the
nation's seventh-largest cable operator, based in St. Louis, would
own systems with about 1.2 million subscribers in several small and
medium-sized markets in several states, including Oregon, Missouri
and California, particularly Los Angeles. Some analysts suggested
that Charter would be willing to swap assets with other cable
operators to gain market share in urban Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Charter would not comment on the possible
acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Allen's recent acquisitions may put him in a position to
challenge AT&AMP;T or other major telecommunications concerns that have
been vying for cable assets this year as a way to expand Internet
capabilities into every home.
</P>
<P>
   But any deal with Falcon is sure to be complicated. Last year
Falcon joined with Tele-Communications Inc. to restructure itself
and refinance its heavy debt load, leaving TCI with a 47 percent
stake in Falcon. At that time, the chairman and chief executive of
Falcon, Marc Nathanson, said he was considering taking Falcon
public or remaining an independent company.
</P>
<P>
   But AT&AMP;T has been on its own $90 billion cable buying binge,
first agreeing to buy TCI last year and, more recently, MediaOne.
</P>
<P>
   The deal between Falcon and Charter is expected to be a stock
swap of privately held shares. And one banker suggested that AT&AMP;T
would consider selling its stake _ which it will acquire in the TCI
transaction _ once the privately held Charter begins selling shares
to the public.
</P>
<P>
   That could come as soon as this year. Charter is expected to go
public in the second half of this year as long as the market
remains receptive, and could sell for as much as $2 billion to $3
billion in stock. If successful, the public offering would be the
largest ever in the cable-television industry.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a faltering, hesitant voice, Justin A. Volpe
admitted Tuesday that he rammed a stick into Abner Louima's rectum
and then thrust it in his face, an act, the police officer
acknowledged, intended to humiliate and intimidate the handcuffed
Haitian immigrant.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you tell anybody about this, I'll find you and kill you,''
Volpe said he told Louima moments after the Aug. 9, 1997, assault
in the bathroom of the 70th precinct house in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   By pleading guilty, Volpe hoped to be spared a life sentence for
the assault that cast a shadow on the entire New York Police
Department. But while he offered chilling details about acts he has
long denied, Volpe did not implicate any other officers by name,
even though four others are still on trial in the case.
</P>
<P>
   As he confessed to six federal crimes, Volpe at times struggled
for words when pressed to explain the forces that compelled him to
torture Louima.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you put the stick up towards his face, having shoved it
into his rectum, was that a part of your effort to humiliate him?''
U.S. District Judge Eugene H. Nickerson asked at one point, his
tone quietly insistent.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe paused, then said, ``I was in shock at the time, your
honor.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge repeated the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe what happened,'' Volpe said, again seeming
to fumble. And then: ``I was mad.''
</P>
<P>
   Still unsatisfied, Nickerson tried once more. ``You intended to
humiliate him?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Volpe finally said, averting his eyes from the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe, 27, wept but once, at the end of the 45-minute hearing
when he said to Nickerson, ``Your honor, if I could just let the
record reflect I'm sorry for hurting my family.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge cut him off. ``You'll get a chance to do that when you
come to sentence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe wiped the tears from his eyes, and then turned and looked
into the audience for his most outspoken defender, his father,
Robert Volpe, a retired New York police detective once renowned for
solving art thefts. The son managed a weak smile to his father as
security officers led him from the courtroom and took him into
custody.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are all different kinds of hell,'' Robert Volpe said
later. ``It's not easy seeing your son taken away.''
</P>
<P>
   Volpe did not apologize to Louima, but his lawyer, Marvyn M.
Kornberg, said he was clearly remorseful. ``When you plead guilty,
I think that's a sufficient apology,'' Kornberg said. ``The man's
facing life.''
</P>
<P>
   Even by throwing himself to the mercy of the court, a decision
Volpe made after hearing devastating testimony against him by
fellow officers, Volpe at a minimum faces a minimum of 30 years in
a federal prison, his lawyers said. He also could be fined up to
$1.5 -million for violating Louima's civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   No sentencing date was set.
</P>
<P>
   The plea was seized on by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani as evidence
that the Police Department had turned a corner in its battle with
corruption and brutality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It destroys the myth of the blue wall of silence,'' the mayor
said, alluding to the testimony of Volpe's fellow officers, who
described how Volpe had boasted of the attack after carrying it
out.
</P>
<P>
   With his guilty plea, Volpe was automatically dismissed from the
police force. Since the attack, he had been on modified duty,
meaning he carried neither badge nor gun, but continued to be paid.
Louima was not in court to hear Volpe's guilty plea, but his
cousin, the Rev. Samuel Nicolas, spoke for the family Tuesday,
telling reporters outside the court: ``We just like to thank God
for keeping Abner alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Pastor Nicolas also thanked federal prosecutors and he asked for
healing. He said the Louima family ``looks forward for the rest of
justice to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the four other officers also charged in the case
will return to court as their trial continues. Their lawyers were
conferring with Nickerson Tuesday to decide how best to explain to
jurors Volpe's sudden exit without tainting any juror's impression
of the evidence against the remaining defendants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're obviously very pleased with today's development,'' U.S.
Attorney Zachary W. Carter said, declining to say much more because
the trial is continuing.
</P>
<P>
   The courtroom was so crowded for Volpe's plea that when Robert
Volpe entered, one of the few remaining seats was a few feet down
from Carter. Volpe squeezed in; Carter stood up and moved across
the aisle to another spot.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty minutes before the appointed hour, Justin Volpe slipped
into the courtroom through a side door. Accompanied by his lawyers
and several police officers, he appeared relaxed and polished.
</P>
<P>
   He had spent the night at his parents' home in Staten Island,
eating with with mother and father, visiting with his girlfriend,
as a e half-dozen watchful law enforcement officials decamped
outside with a couple of hecklers. In court, he chatted amiably
with his lawyers and his private investigator.
</P>
<P>
   But minutes before Nickerson walked in, Volpe searched the court
for his father, who, along with an uncle, were the only relatives
to attend the hearing. When their eyes met, Robert Volpe gave him a
smile, and then a clerk called out, ``United States of America
versus Justin Volpe.'' Volpe's poise then began to fade.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by his lawyers, he faced Nickerson, who peered back over
half-glasses and showed none of his usual wit. Nickerson asked him
if he understood what he was about to do, and Volpe, in a low and
throaty voice, said he did.
</P>
<P>
   When the moment of confession arrived, Volpe reached into his
jacket and pulled out a one-page statement. He took several deep
breaths, and rocked back and forth, and read the words until he got
to the phrase, ``I sodomized ...'' Then he paused. Then he took
another breath. Then he sniffled and finished the sentence: ``...
Mr. Louima by placing a stick in his rectum.''
</P>
<P>
   In the audience, his father's eyes were red, and he kept pulling
at his mustache and stroking his chin and rubbing the bridge of his
nose.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``That's it, that's your statement?'' Nickerson asked when Volpe
stopped reading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, Your Honor, if you have any questions,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   Nickerson had many questions. Were Louima's hands in shackles
when he was assaulted in a police car? Yes. Did he ever threaten to
kill Louima's family? No. Was Louima handcuffed when the stick was
shoved up his rectum? Yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you put it to his mouth, close to his mouth?'' the judge
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put it in front of his mouth, yes,'' Volpe replied.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, sitting with Louima's mother near the back
of the courtroom, had a one-word description for Volpe's account:
``Chilling.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, speaking to reporters outside the courthouse, Sharpton
lambasted Volpe's lawyer, Kornberg, for suggesting during his
opening statement that Louima's severe internal injuries could have
been caused by consensual gay sex.
</P>
<P>
   Kornberg never asked Louima about that suggestion during his
testimony for the prosecution. And since Volpe pleaded guilty
before his lawyers began their defense, there was no testimony to
support the contention.
</P>
<P>
   Given Volpe's confession, such a defense theory was tantamount
to ``a second rape,'' Sharpton said at a news conference outside
court. ``This vindicates Abner's character. It vindicates those of
us who stood for Abner.''
</P>
<P>
   A reporter called out one last question to Sharpton: ``Is it
Giuliani time?'' he asked, making a reference to Louima's famous
falsehood about what the police officers told him during the
assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's justice time,'' Sharpton shouted, a rallying cry that was
embraced by a raucous crowd of protesters who hooted and booed when
Kornberg stepped to the microphones, where he has waged a daily
defense for his client.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Kornberg, you bum!'' one man shouted over and over.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters repeatedly asked Kornberg if he owed Louima an apology
for insinuating that his injuries came from gay sex. Not at all,
Kornberg replied, pointing out that he never directly said Louima
was gay.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kornberg, who prides himself as New York's premier lawyer
for police officers in trouble, was clearly on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that he had been caught off guard by some of the
police officers who testified against Volpe and that ``there came a
point in time when the evidence became overwhelming.'' And he
distanced himself from Volpe's aboutface when he said, ``I don't
make decisions for clients to plead guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   But as he said these things, he was nearly drowned out by the
din of the protesters, who heckled him without mercy, and who broke
past the barricades and had to be restrained by police officers
when Kornberg slipped into the passenger seat of his private
investigator's white Jaguar.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the protesters, faces contorted in anger, pounded on
the Jaguar until it pulled away from the courthouse, where Justin
Volpe waited to be taken to jail.

 &HT;    American suit trailed by AirTran complaint
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On the heels of a government lawsuit against American
Airlines for predatory pricing against smaller rivals, AirTran is
lodging fresh complaints of similar behavior by Atlanta rival Delta
Air Lines.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief sent to the Justice and Transportation departments,
AirTran said Delta uses matching fares and extra flights to soak up
low-fare demand on key routes. The carrier said the goal is to
force AirTran to retreat so Delta can raise fares.
</P>
<P>
   ``Delta's competitive response to AirTran over the years, and
increasingly in recent days, has only one objective _ drive a
small-but-growing, successful low-fare carrier out of its
markets,'' the brief said.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran executives, who insisted they were working on the brief
before the May 13 American suit, said they aren't seeking a lawsuit
or specific remedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've done is reviewed the competitive practices,''
AirTran President Robert Fornaro said. ``We want the DOJ and DOT to
pass judgment on them however they see fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Delta spokesman Bill Berry called the charges an ``insulting and
untrue'' rehash of old allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``AirTran, formerly ValuJet, has used such charges for years to
divert attention from its own problems,'' Berry said. ``No
government agency has ever found Delta to be in the wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for AirTran, which is one of the largest discount
carriers in the country, to accept responsibility for its past
marketing failures and stop blaming the competition,'' Berry added.
</P>
<P>
   ValuJet and AirTran have periodically complained of Delta's
tactics, but Fornaro said the AirTran brief contains new details of
intensified activity.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, according to the brief:
</P>
<P>
   _ Delta has raised walk-up fares 52 percent on the
Atlanta-Richmond, Va., route since AirTran withdrew last winter in
the face of intensive fare-matching.
</P>
<P>
   _ Delta last fall began flights to Chicago-Midway Airport, which
it had never before served, and undercut AirTran's average fares by
8 percent. AirTran said it may be forced to withdraw from that
route, too.
</P>
<P>
   _ Delta responded to a recent AirTran sale by not only matching
fares but also dropping round-trip and weekend stay requirements.
The response, which AirTran claims was unprecedented, came after it
announced a first-quarter profit _ only its second in the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
   In the American case, the DOJ charges the carrier drove low-fare
carriers out of its Dallas-Fort Worth hub by flooding routes with
cheap fares. While the suit signals a more protective government
stance toward small airlines, legal experts say the case will be
tough to win because of prior court decisions.

COMMENTARY: SIAMESE SENATORS

<P>
   NEW YORK _ There is no other conversation here.
</P>
<P>
   New York is consumed with watching the renowned gladiators
warily circle one another, two tough cookies ready to rumble.
</P>
<P>
   Surely these A-plus students are already studying oppo-research,
getting ready to exploit every mistake, every gaffe, every weakness
until one or the other is utterly destroyed. You can picture the
first lady and the mayor hunched over their neat desks late at
night, a single light burning, as they peruse briefing papers on
each other.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine Rudy's briefing book on Hillary:
</P>
<P>
   She envisions how things should be and assumes she can make it
so.
</P>
<P>
   Her world is black and white.
</P>
<P>
   She's most sure she's right when she's most wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Her smile is not connected to her face.
</P>
<P>
   She despises the press.
</P>
<P>
   She quickly gets paranoid.
</P>
<P>
   Her marriage is troubled, mysterious to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   She has a nun's lofty air of sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   She's polarizing. People who like her really like her and people
who don't really don't.
</P>
<P>
   Her spouse is probably hoping she becomes a senator and moves
away.
</P>
<P>
   You might admire her but you wouldn't want to hang out with her.
</P>
<P>
   Her aides comport themselves like members of a cult, their faces
a jittery mix of adoration and fear.
</P>
<P>
   She supported Mario Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   She disdains Al D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   She has a temper.
</P>
<P>
   She favors the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   She favors welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
   Her nickname is Saint Hillary.
</P>
<P>
   She runs a secretive ship.
</P>
<P>
   She has a very long memory for political enemies.
</P>
<P>
   She's unwilling to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   She puts ambition ahead of her personal life.
</P>
<P>
   She sometimes mistakes herself for a messianic figure.
</P>
<P>
   She does not get distracted by pleasure. She is superhumanly
single-minded.
</P>
<P>
   She sees the world like a litigator, a take-no-prisoners
attitude that casts things in extreme terms, even when the ideas
are moderate.
</P>
<P>
   She has a conviction that anything she does is the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes she tries to project a softer image, Ms.
Have-a-Nice-Day, but nobody buys it.
</P>
<P>
   She sees the Senate as a stepping stone to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   She has serious hair issues.

ADMINISTRATION PLEDGES ACTION ON IMPROVED SAFETY FOR TRUCKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration on Tuesday set a goal of
reducing fatalities from truck crashes by 50 percent over 10 years,
and promised quick action on safety questions that have stymied it
for years, including revising the 62-year-old rules on how many
hours a day a driver can work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up to this point, very little focus has been placed on the
needs of the drivers,'' said Transportation Secretary Rodney
Slater, announcing the new goal. ``It's always been, for the most
part, the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   The current rules, written long before the age of
transcontinental truck routes, call for drivers to have 8 hours off
after 10 hours of driving or 15 hours of work, which can include
loading and unloading or other duties. The rest hours can be split
into two parts, the shorter as little as 2 hours, and can be taken
in a cab's sleeper berth.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board, which estimates that
750 to 1,500 deaths annually occur in crashes in which trucker
fatigue is a factor, has put new rules on hours on its ``most
wanted'' list of safety improvements since 1990. The Transportation
Department proposed new rules in 1995, but, unable to win consensus
among labor, business and safety groups, has not moved forward.
Slater said on Tuesday that unless the pace was increased, no new
rule would be written before President Clinton's term ends.
</P>
<P>
   And the existing rule is widely disobeyed, Transportation
Department officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Mead, the inspector general of the department, said the
industry's economic structure, with drivers widely paid by the mile
instead of the hour, would have to change to make the system safer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't drive till they're exhausted because they want
to,'' Mead said.
</P>
<P>
   He has detailed a series of problems with the department's
Office of Motor Carriers recently. In 1998, he said, more than
20,000 violations were cited by investigators, but only 11 percent
resulted in fines, and of those, fines paid were only 46 percent of
the dollar amounts initially assessed. The average final payment
was $1,500, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Slater and Kenneth Wykle, the federal highway administrator,
said one step would be bigger fines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will take a more aggressive posture,'' Wykle said.
</P>
<P>
   Under legislation that took effect this year, fines for serious
violations of trucking rules, formerly limited to $1,000 each and
$10,000 per accident or incident, are now set at $10,000 each, with
no ceiling. And fines for record-keeping violations, formerly $500
each with a cap of $2,500, are now $5,000 each, with no ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Federal statistics show that the number of accidents per million
miles traveled has fallen steadily, but the number of deaths is
stubbornly high, because the industry is booming. Slater said on
Tuesday that the number of miles traveled by trucks was up 25
percent in the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,
5,398 people died in crashes involving heavy trucks in 1997, nearly
all of them in a car, van, pickup or other light vehicle, not the
heavy truck. The preliminary number for 1998 is 5,302.

RUSSIAN PREMIER NAMES POINT MAN ON ECONOMIC POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov, an advocate of tough
fiscal policies, will take charge of Russia's economic policy, said
Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Zadornov's promotion to the rank of first deputy prime minister
was one of the few surprises in a series of Cabinet appointments
announced Tuesday by the new prime minister as he returned to
Moscow after meeting with President Boris Yeltsin at the Black Sea
resort of Sochi.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier reports had the job going to Alexander Zhukov, the
moderate chairman of the Parliament's budget committee, whose views
on economic policy are similar to Zadornov's.
</P>
<P>
   By giving broader responsibilities to Zadornov, a 36-year-old
economist well regarded by Russia's Western financial partners,
Stepashin succeeded in convincing the Yeltsin administration that
an experienced finance manager should be put in overall charge of
Russia's debt-ridden economy.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin already has one first deputy prime minister, Nikolai
Aksyonenko, a former railways minister who had also been a
candidate to head the government after the firing of Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Aksyonenko, reportedly a favorite of Yeltsin's inner circle, was
a surprise guest at Tuesday's talks in Sochi, where Yeltsin has
gone for a two-week vacation. After the talks, Stepashin said that
his deputy's appearance had been planned, and said that his new
government would make a ``good team.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin confirmed that Zhukov had also been considered to run
the economy, but he said his support was more important in the
Parliament's lower house, the Duma. ``The Zadornov-Zhukov
combination will be very useful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a few changes in minor ministries, the Stepashin
government _ now 80 percent complete _ looks remarkably like the
one headed by Primakov. The former head of the Tax Service, Georgi
Boos, was replaced by Alexander Pochinok, who previously had held
the post. Mikhail Kasyonov, a deputy finance minister, was promoted
to succeed Zadornov. Yeltsin last week reconfirmed a series of
ministers, including Gen. Igor Sergeyev as defense minister and
Igor Ivanov as foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all the changes that will take place in the Cabinet in the
future are like this, one cannot say that this will be a government
that is new to any serious extent,'' Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of
Parliament's largest liberal party, told reporters Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist speaker of the lower house, Gennady Seleznyov,
welcomed the appointment of Zadornov, whom he described as ``a
professional who knows his job.'' But, he warned that Zadornov
would be successful only ``if he listens to the opinion of
parliamentarians.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Tuesday that Zadornov, a former Parliament budget
chairman and veteran of three previous governments, has the
credentials and the experience needed for the job. The main
question, they said, is whether he _ and the Stepashin government
generally _ will get the political support they need from a
Parliament that is already getting ready for elections in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zadornov knows what needs to be done,'' said David Riley,
director of emerging European market for Fitch IBCA, a New
York-based credit rating company. ``The question mark is whether he
has enough political support to deliver.''
</P>
<P>
   The Parliament is soon due to consider a legislative package _
part of which was already introduced by the Primakov government _
intended to meet the fiscal requirements set by the International
Monetary Fund for a critical $4.5 billion debt relief program for
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's ability to meet these conditions is also crucial for a
restructuring of $90 billion of Soviet-era debts to Western
governments and commercial banks, on which Russia has already
missed several payments this year. Analysts this week were already
predicting that Russia will not pay $216 million in interest due
the London club of commercial creditors on June 2.

thousands built in the 1970's as a defense against foreign
invasion. Some of the bunkers are currently being used as
protective barriers around the NATO encampments. The transformation
from communist outpost to a member of the European community of

TOBACCO INDUSTRY'S TOURISM WARNINGS UNFOUNDED, STUDY SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PHILLIP W. BROWNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Even though smokers are banished to restaurant
patios and sidewalks in California, the statewide smoking ban has
not harmed tourism as the tobacco industry predicted, according to
a study released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Smoking bans in three states and six cities were established at
a time when tourism was on a significant upswing, and those numbers
have risen, according to the University of California, San
Francisco, study.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tobacco industry is full of hot air when they say the
world will come to an end with smoking bans,'' said Stanton A.
Glantz, author of the report that appears today &UR;  &LR; in the Journal of
the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Local governments can institute bans without fear of economic
impact,'' said Glantz, a medical researcher who became a tobacco
industry critic when the smoking debate shifted from health to
economic issues.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles since 1994, hotel revenues have jumped from $450
million that year to almost $600 million in 1998, the study says.
California's restaurant smoking ban became law in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco industry advocates say the latest study is another one
of Glantz's ``scams.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just another advocacy piece masquerading as research,''
said Tom Humber, president of the National Smokers Alliance, an
Arlington, Va.-based group that advocates smokers rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any economist with any knowledge of the hospitality industry
would laugh this research out of the country,'' Humber said.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, the tourism industry's greatest challenge has
been overcoming the 1992 riots and the 1994 Northridge Earthquake
-- not the smoking ban, said Michael Collins, executive vice
president of the Los Angeles Convention and Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Local tourism continues to climb even with the ban in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every single tourism indicator has marched upward with huge
increases,'' Collins said. ``I'm sure the bans have had some effect
on individual businesses somewhere, but tourism and visitor
spending has jumped.''
</P>
<P>
   Humber said all recent smoking ban studies are flawed because
researchers focus on industry revenue data without taking into
account compliance with the ban and other factors.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Los Angeles there's only about a 50 percent compliance to
the ban, so people spend the same money, they just spend it at
places where they can smoke,'' Humber said. ``The businesses that
comply are severely impacted.''
</P>
<P>
   The states included in the study were California, Utah and
Vermont. Cities studied included Los Angeles; San Francisco; New
York; Mesa, Ariz.; Boulder, Colo. and Flagstaff, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   In every case, the data showed that hotel occupancy has
increased dramatically in those cities since the bans became the
vogue in the mid-1990s, the report says.

 &HT;    Man found guilty in fatal Haitian smuggling trip
 &HT;    By Clay Lambert
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ Addison Joseph Hepburn piloted a rickety
boatload of Haitians to the Palm Beach County coastline last August
and forced them out of his boat about a mile offshore, causing the
death of one woman, a federal jury decided Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge William Dimitrouleas set sentencing
for Aug. 13 after a Broward County jury rendered its decision.
Hepburn faces a mandatory 3-year sentence for profiting from his
smuggling plan. Witnesses said they paid as much as $1,500 to be
ferried to the United States from the Bahamas. Attorneys for both
sides said guidelines likely will limit his sentence to little more
than the 3 mandatory years.
</P>
<P>
   The jury found Hepburn guilty of eight counts of smuggling,
eight counts of smuggling for financial gain and one count of
smuggling that resulted in death. While federal prosecutors believe
33 Haitian immigrants were on the 23-foot motor boat piloted by
Hepburn the night of Aug. 10, they could identify only eight
passengers. The jury considered charges related to smuggling those
eight people.
</P>
<P>
   Hepburn, a 45-year-old Bahamian fisherman, dumped his human
cargo on a sandbar about 100 yards from land. Some swam ashore,
where they were picked up by Palm Beach County sheriff's deputies.
Others were rescued from the sandbar. Two Haitians died struggling
between the sandbar and the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Hepburn, who was later nabbed as he slept on his broken-down
boat, was held responsible for the drowning death of Benette
Dorsonne. But the jury found Hepburn not guilty of causing the
death of another drowning victim _ Richard Presendieu. Witnesses
provided conflicting evidence of whether Presendieu was a passenger
on Hepburn's boat.
</P>
<P>
   Before presenting its findings, the jury of seven men and five
women asked Dimitrouleas to define ``resulting'' in the charge of
smuggling resulting in death. He offered little help, sending a
handwritten note imploring them to ``rely on their collective
understanding of what the word 'resulting' means.''
</P>
<P>
   One juror said that was the only point of contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we were all tied up about was whether he was responsible
for the death,'' Janice Freiert said after the verdict. ``He didn't
commit murder.''

CLINTON VOWS CHANGES IN WAKE OF CHINESE SPYING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Faced with a bipartisan congressional report
indicating that China's theft of U.S. nuclear secrets continues
``to this very day,'' President Clinton pledged Tuesday to
implement many of the committee's recommendations for safeguarding
strategic technology.
</P>
<P>
   In an appearance in Edinburg, Texas, Clinton said his
administration already is ``moving aggressively'' to strengthen
security at nuclear laboratories and said he would work with
Congress to safeguard U.S. nuclear secrets. At the same time, the
president said there should be no change in U.S. policy toward
China.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will work very hard with the Congress to protect our
national security, to implement the recommendations, and to
continue our policy of engagement (with China) because both of them
are in our national interests,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   In the long-awaited report, the congressional committee headed
by Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., catalogs Chinese espionage since
the late 1970s. Investigators say the nuclear information stolen
probably gives China the ability to develop weapons ``on a par with
our own.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee's top-ranking Democrat, Rep. Norman Dicks of
Washington, called the security breeches that aided the Chinese as
``a major counterintelligence failure ... one of the worst failures
in the nation's history.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, published in three volumes covering more than 700
pages, brought fresh Republican demands for top Clinton
administration officials to resign for their lax security measures
and slowness to respond to the espionage. It also drew sharp
responses from a variety of GOP presidential aspirants, including
Texas Gov. George W. Bush whose father was vice president and then
president for 12 years while the espionage was occurring.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton ``calls China a strategic partner,'' said
Bush. ``China is not America's strategic partner. China is a
competitor, a competitor which does not share our values but now,
unfortunately, shares many of our nuclear secrets.''
</P>
<P>
   Approved unanimously by the five Republican and four Democratic
members of the committee, the report was released after months of
wrangling among the committee, the White House and intelligence
agencies about how much information, much of it classified, could
be published. About 30 percent of the report remains classified.
</P>
<P>
   It outlines a multilayered espionage effort by China that
yielded crucial data on such items as the highly secret W-88
warhead, as well as secrets on the as-yet undeployed neutron bomb.
The report also listed submarine-detection, space-weapon
information and special nuclear codes among the compromised data.
</P>
<P>
   ``The People's Republic of China has stolen classified
information on every currently deployed warhead in the U.S.
ballistic missile arsenal,'' Cox said. ``It is exceptionally likely
that penetration of our U.S. national weapons laboratories
continues to this very day.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials denounced the report as a ploy to demonize the
Beijing government and divert attention from the bombing of China's
Embassy in Belgrade during the NATO air attacks against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report is full of groundless allegations,'' said Liu
Xiaoming, chief of China's mission to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The report details a web of tactics, including using U.S.
businesses to lobby for looser export standards, exploiting
information available publicly, scientific exchange programs, joint
ventures with U.S. corporations, and old-fashioned espionage at the
nation's nuclear research facilities, primarily at Los Alamos in
New Mexico and Lawrence Livermore in California.
</P>
<P>
   The report says U.S. scientists visiting China often would be
praised for their expertise, feted at elaborate banquets, and
peppered with technical questions, often after ``substantial
amounts of alcohol have been consumed.'' At other times, the report
says, scientists would be taken on sightseeing tours while their
hotel rooms were burglarized.
</P>
<P>
   Cox said international scientific cooperation is laudable, but
everyone must play by the same rule. While U.S. agencies must be
willing to take the blame for lax security and shoddy
counter-intelligence efforts, ``we are not willing to forgive
people engaged in espionage,'' Cox said. ``And if we catch them,
they should be executed.''
</P>
<P>
   Security at the labs ``will not meet even minimal standards
until sometime next year,'' said Cox, whose committee made 38
recommendations for safeguarding U.S. nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to tighter lab security, the committee's
recommendations include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Tighter export controls, especially for the sale of high-power
computers and in helping China's satellite launches.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reports by the president to congressional leaders at least
every six months on actions being taken to respond to espionage by
China.
</P>
<P>
   _ A damage assessment by appropriate agencies of the
implications of the security breaches.
</P>
<P>
   _ Consideration by congressional committees of whether the
Department of Energy should continue to maintain U.S. nuclear
weapons responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   While lauding the Cox committee for its ``good, solid report,''
the Clinton administration and some congressional Democrats,
including members of the Cox panel, dismissed claims about how much
China's nuclear-weapons program was aided by access to U.S.
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said 30 of the committee's
recommendations already have been accepted and many of them are
being implemented. He said there is ``no evidence of wholesale loss
of information,'' or that the U.S. is losing its nuclear edge to
China.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is not up to par with the United States on nuclear
development. It is far behind us,'' Richardson said, adding that he
will announce disciplinary action next week against government
workers responsible for lax security at the agency's Los Alamos
facility.
</P>
<P>
   Dicks, the ranking Democrat on the Cox committee, agreed with
Richardson's assessment of China's nuclear capability. ``As of
today, (China) has not deployed a single new nuclear weapon based
on the information they have obtained,'' he said, urging his
congressional colleagues and the media to keep the report in
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States still possesses overwhelming nuclear
superiority over China with more than 6,000 strategic nuclear
warheads currently in our inventory, compared to China's total of
about two dozen,'' Dicks said. ``It remains to be seen what use
(China) can make of the information it has acquired.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the committee's report prompted renewed calls for the
resignation or investigation of Attorney General Janet Reno and
National Security Adviser Sandy Berger for failure to respond
quickly to reports of spying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sandy Berger has failed in his duty to the administration and
the American people and I think he ought to accept his
responsibility,'' said House Majority Leader Richard Armey,
R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Armey said Berger first learned that China had stolen missile
warhead technology in April 1996 and was briefed again in July
1997. Berger has testified that he notified Clinton of the security
breach later that month. Two months ago, the president said: ``To
the best of my knowledge, no one has said anything to me about any
espionage, which occurred by the Chinese against the labs, during
my presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Armey said, ``I just think Sandy Berger should resign.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Jim Kennedy said the president ``has full
confidence in Sandy Berger, and we would take strong objection to
anything to the contrary.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., had urged Reno to resign
because of the FBI and Justice Department handling of the
espionage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has full confidence in the attorney general and
she is secure in her position,'' White House press secretary Joe
Lockhart said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Tuesday about Shelby's call for her resignation, Reno
said, ``We just respectfully disagree.'' The attorney general
called the Cox report ``very constructive'' and said it offers
``some very important suggestions about what to do about
espionage.''
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, a frequent critic of the
president, said for six years the Clinton administration ``turned a
blind eye while Communist China stole our most classified national
security secrets.'' The Texas Republican questioned whether Clinton
and Vice President Al Gore ``deliberately ignored the reality of
Chinese spying and theft because they had ulterior economic and
political motives'' _ a reference to 1996 campaign contributions
from Chinese interests to the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The committee was organized a year ago after then-House Speaker
Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., initiated an investigation into whether
Chinese contributions to the Democrats, which have since been
returned, influenced the administration's decisions regarding
exports of sensitive technology to China. &QL;

 &HT;    Pulitzer, investor husband defuse divorce plan again
 &HT;    By Tim O'Meilia
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The on-again, off-again marriage of
Roxanne Pulitzer and real estate investor Harald Dude is apparently
on again before it was officially off.
</P>
<P>
   Dude filed for divorce Thursday in Palm Beach County Circuit
Court but Pulitzer won't even be served the official papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've reconciled already. We're fast,'' trumpeted the one-time
Palm Beach socialite from her car phone Tuesday. Dude would have
been ex-husband No. 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that every time we get mad, we file (for
divorce),'' laughed Dude, sitting beside her in the car. ``Then we
kiss and make up.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not the first trip to divorce court for the combative
couple. The last time, in 1996, she filed. She declared she needed
$12,393 a month to live on but had no reliable income.
</P>
<P>
   But they made up then, too, and the petition was withdrawn in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Pulitzer's 1980s divorce trial from newspaper heir Herbert
``Peter'' Pulitzer _ with tales of cocaine, lesbianism and
debauchery _ launched her career as a writer.
</P>
<P>
   Her first book, the autobiography The Prize Pulitzer, was based
on that marriage. Her last book, published in 1995, was a novel
called The Palm Beach Story.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Dude's divorce suit is still in the court system.
Said his lawyer, Charles Cohen of Boca Raton: ``I can't discuss
what I've heard from my client.''

   MARKET CONTINUES ITS SLIDE LED BY TECHNOLOGY SHARES
</P>
<P>
   Stocks slumped for the fourth consecutive session as a selloff
continued in technology and Internet issues. The technology-laden
NASDAQ composite index has fallen just less than 10 percent since
its peak on April 26.
</P>
<P>
   Led by big declines in favorites like Intel, Cisco Systems and
Yahoo, NASDAQ fell 72.77 points, or 3 percent, to 2,380.89. But it
was a bad day almost everywhere. The Dow Jones industrial average
declined 123.58 points, or 1.2 percent, to 10,531.09, while the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index dropped 22.25 points, or 1.7
percent, to 1,284.40.
</P>
<P>
   McKESSON TO REVISE RESULTS AGAIN
</P>
<P>
   McKesson HBOC announced that it would make further revisions to
its fiscal and quarterly earnings because of improperly recorded
sales at HBO and Co., a software maker it acquired in January.
Investors quickly sold the company's shares, which dropped $4.6875,
or 12.3 percent, to $33.50, barely above its 52-week low.
</P>
<P>
   US AIRWAYS TO REPLACE SHUTTLE JETS
</P>
<P>
   As part of a multimillion-dollar overhaul of its shuttle between
Washington, New York and Boston, US Airways plans to announce that
it will retire its fleet of noisy, 30-year-old Boeing 727s and
replace them by the end of the year with larger and quieter Airbus
A-320s. Aircraft noise has long generated complaints from residents
of the Queens neighborhoods that surround La Guardia Airport, which
will also have an expanded terminal.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA TO SHARE COMPANY'S LOSS
</P>
<P>
   Softening its tone toward foreign lenders, China announced a
plan to overhaul a debt-ridden state company, with the banks and
the government sharing the losses.
</P>
<P>
   SOME HOTEL RATES FALL IN NEW YORK
</P>
<P>
   Occupancy rates at Manhattan hotels in the first quarter of this
year dropped, leading approximately one-fifth of New York hotels _
particularly the larger ones _ to lower their room rates despite
public perception of rising rates in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   TOY CONCERNS SETTLE ANTITRUST CASE
</P>
<P>
   Several leading players in the toy industry agreed to pay 44
states $50 million in cash and merchandise to settle antitrust
charges. Toys ``R'' Us, known by its spokesgiraffe, Geoffrey, was
accused of orchestrating the conspiracy to restrict competition. It
agreed to pay the heftiest amount _ toys with a retail value of $27
million and $13.5 million in cash to be used for toys, books and
educational material.
</P>
<P>
   BARNESANDNOBLE.COM GAINS 27 PERCENT
</P>
<P>
   The initial offering of Barnesandnoble.com, the Web business
spun off by the bookseller Barnes &AMP; Noble, gained a mere 27 percent
in its first day of trading, never approaching the 200-percent-plus
first-day multiples of recent offerings by Internet companies.

   YEAR 2000 CONTINGENCY PLANNING
</P>
<P>
   Mutual funds should make year-end payouts to investors before

REPRESENTING AMERICA IN A LANGUAGE OF HER OWN  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 30) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Maine, Ohio)   (af)  
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ann Hamilton, the installation artist who will represent the
United States in the 48th Venice Biennale, is a slight woman who
dresses in the art-world uniform, black pants and jacket, her
salt-and-pepper hair closely cropped.
</P>
<P>
   But if she looks like a pixie, she also has a mind as imposing
as an Oxford don's _ and much more imaginative. Her works are known
for being sensory and cerebral at the same time. They are, she
says, ``an accumulation of gestures'' that speak in a language that
is hers alone.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, Ms. Hamilton fashions a variety of materials _
massive amounts of everything from honey and cut flowers to wool
coats, canaries, peacocks, soot, bread dough and horsehair _ into
complex, evocative installations encoded with layers of meaning.
She (or a stand-in) is often part of the work, and she regularly
includes a text or audio component. Her work is very difficult to
collect, though many museums have shown it.
</P>
<P>
   Much more than with many artists, viewing an Ann Hamilton
creation is like peering into her mind, stepping into a temporary
world she devises in response to a specific site.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the neo-classical United States Pavilion at the
Biennale, which opens on June 13, Ms. Hamilton is placing a veil of
water glass that will frame and distort the image of the building
seen through it. Inside the pavilion, she will have fuchsia-colored
powder sifting down the gallery walls, collecting on Braille dots
that spell out verse about human suffering. Barely audible in the
background is a whispered recording of an excerpt from Abraham
Lincoln's second inaugural address.
</P>
<P>
   The installation, called ``Myein,'' deals with how we know what
we know and what we blind ourselves to, how the invisible affects
us and how the visible can be veiled, how we learn from seeing and
from touching. It is also about dualisms, like our longing to be
alone yet our need to be part of a social unit. And it is about
looking very hard at the things we as humans do to other people.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Hamilton does not explain her titles, ``Myein,'' a
Greek root of the word mystery, refers to an abnormal contraction
of the eye's pupil, and to a rite of initiation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking that I am the American representative, and it's
the eve of the millennium,'' she said in an interview in early
February, when her ideas for the piece were starting to
crystallize. ``I want to bring to the surface the questions we
should be asking.''
</P>
<P>
   If the work sounds strange, well, that is not unusual. Katy
Kline, one of two curators who nominated Ms. Hamilton as the
American representative and thus drafted a proposal, said it was
difficult to describe Ms. Hamilton's work. ``She has an approach
that almost deliberately tries to circumvent the verbal,'' said Ms.
Kline, who is the director of the Bowdoin College Museum of Art in
Maine. ``She invites the viewer into a set of visible and auditory
conditions where their entire bodily experience is activated. They
are swept into a state of awareness beyond that of the normal
viewer. She tries to intrigue the whole body.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, critics are usually engaged, mindful that Ms.
Hamilton reaches beyond her grasp and often _ but not always _
succeeds. At 42, she is acknowledged as a top artist of her
generation and her work, at its best, is lauded as poignant, poetic
and theatrical.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Fund for U.S. Artists at International Festivals and
Exhibitions had to make something of a leap of faith when it chose
her from a field of 15 nominees. Unlike most past representatives _
the painter Robert Colescott, the video artist Bill Viola and the
sculptor Louise Bourgeois in recent years _ Ms. Hamilton was not
offering to fill the pavilion mostly with existing work.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Ms. Kline and Helaine Posner, an independent curator who
collaborated on the nomination, essentially suggested that the
panel commission a work by Ms. Hamilton. First, though, they
described her past work and her general approach, which is about as
distant as one can imagine from a painter putting brush to canvas
or a sculptor casting metal.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the things Ms. Hamilton has been doing over the
last nine months to make the work, as related in a series of
interviews:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm reading wildly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been on the phone for the last three days with makeup
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell people what I'm thinking about, and they send me
things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm gathering stuff on Braille.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made two walls in my studio, with different size dots for
Braille.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent three solid days on the phone talking with chemists.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're figuring out how close the holes should be, how big the
orifices, and the speed of motion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I use the Thomas Register _ it's my bible, it's a registry of
companies and manufacturers.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, she created several parts for ``Myein,'' beginning
with the veil of rippled glass, which spans the pavilion's 90-foot
length and rises 18 feet from the ground to its pediment. Set seven
feet from the entrance, the steel-and-glass wall will distort the
view of the pavilion, making it something of a mirage.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, gallery walls will be covered in a Braille translation
of passages from Charles Reznikoff's ``Testimony: The United States
1885-1915,'' verse that he published in the 1960s recounting court
cases involving random acts of violence. The fuchsia powder will
slowly descend from the top of the gallery walls, dropped by an
auger system normally used by bakeries and pharmaceutical companies
to control the flow of ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   As time passes, the powder will accumulate around the white
Braille dots, making them visible, yet still frustrating the
viewer's ability to read what they say.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, from invisible speakers, Ms. Hamilton's voice will
whisper Lincoln's message about healing the schism caused by
slavery. It, too, is indecipherable to casual visitors because she
spells out his words letter by letter in international alphabet
code (alpha, bravo, charlie, delta and so on).
</P>
<P>
   Compared with earlier works, Ms. Hamilton said, her description
of ``Myein'' _ as it existed on paper and in her mind, for it is
still under construction in Venice _ seemed minimal to some
confidantes. But not to others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this will be quite shocking,'' said Sean Kelly, her
longtime dealer. ``People think of Ann's work as intelligent,
beautiful, demanding, sensorily charged, but not as very sumptuous,
baroque and sexy, as this is. This will be a piece with a real
richness, a voluptuous aspect.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Then again, it is hard to tell in advance: Ms. Hamilton's works
come together only on the scene and often at the last minute, she
said _ recalling times when she had had to run to a hardware store
to fill some unforeseen need.
</P>
<P>
   In early May, however, on the eve of her flight from her home in
Columbus, Ohio, to Venice, Ms. Hamilton gave all indications that
she was pleased with her conception. With much packing yet to do,
she was calm. And despite some early misgivings about working in
Italy for the first time, she seemed comfortable with the ability
of her team of technical advisers, assistants and curators (about a
dozen people at last count) to pull the project together.
</P>
<P>
   She had clearly come a long way since May 1998, when she learned
that she would represent the United States. Then, she said: ``I
felt very mixed. It's an incredibly wonderful recognition and
opportunity, but I was also terrified. It's probably the most
public thing I'll ever do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hamilton said that on getting the nod she immediately told
her husband, Michael Mercil, a sculptor who teaches studio classes
at Ohio State University, to sit down. ``My first thoughts were
that it's going to be a really, really full year,'' she said.
``Initially, I was thinking very practically, because you're in
denial about it. You don't want to look at it, the furiousness of
the responsibility of it. Then I decided it should be a pleasure.''
</P>
<P>
   Also a culmination. Born in 1956 in Lima, Ohio, Ms. Hamilton
grew up in Columbus, where her family _ her father, a businessman,
her mother, a homemaker, and an older brother _ still lives. ``I
don't know if I ever said, `I'm going to be an artist,''' she said.
``I always liked to make stuff in the way you grow up making
things.''
</P>
<P>
   If she had to pin it down, she said, she probably chose her
profession when she left St. Lawrence University, where she had
studied liberal arts, for the University of Kansas, where she
earned a bachelor's degree in textile design.
</P>
<P>
   She began showing her work professionally in 1981, and later
went to Yale to get a master's degree in sculpture. She taught at
the University of California at Santa Barbara, then returned to
Columbus. Nowadays, she shares both home and studio with her
husband, with whom she has a 4-year-old son, Emmett. He spends a
lot of his time in the studio, too. ``It's his life. He will say,
`My mom made that,''' said Ms. Hamilton, a genuinely down-to-earth
person who occasionally brings up the need to reconcile work with
domestic duties like making dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, last summer, the family made a Biennale research trip to
Monticello _ because many people think the United States Pavilion
resembles Jefferson's home.
</P>
<P>
   That trip came after Ms. Hamilton, along with Ms. Kline, Ms.
Posner and Kelly, went to Venice last summer to get the feel of the
place. She came home with basic instincts about the pavilion's
stately civic mien and thus its ties to American social and
Jeffersonian philosophies. Viewing the space and its structure _ a
central rotunda flanked by four galleries _ she immediately wanted
physical changes, as she often does. False ceilings have been taken
down and skylights uncovered to increase the volume and let in
daylight.
</P>
<P>
   But she said in February that there were, last summer, no
thoughts about what materials might go into the piece. Or a clear
idea. ``I started thinking about where it's situated, about
transparency and opacity, blindness, what is invisible,'' she said.
``How do you evoke those things that are actually invisible to us?
Some of the things that influence us most are invisible.''
</P>
<P>
   She discarded one early thought _ using mirrors to wrap the
pavilion _ as too literal. (But she is placing a mirror inside the
building.)
</P>
<P>
   All along, Ms. Hamilton had been reading to stimulate ideas.
Citing people like Ann Carson, the poet, she said that writers
rather than visual artists have been the strongest influences on
her work.
</P>
<P>
   For this project, she devoured philosophy, social history,
poetry. Things by Whitman, Emerson, Thoreau. ``You float yourself
in an atmosphere that makes you think,'' she explained. ``It's not
that you get ideas directly.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hamilton sometimes writes or calls people whose ideas she
admires, and over the years, she has corresponded with some of
them. This time, Susan Stewart, the author of ``On Longing,'' sent
her texts from Lucretius, John Donne and George Herbert. Ann
Lauterbach, the poet, gave her an essay by Philip Fisher called
``Democratic Social Space: Whitman, Melville, and the Promise of
American Transparency.''
</P>
<P>
   After reading Robert Pogue Harrison's ``Forests: The Shadow of
Civilization,'' Ms. Hamilton called him at Stanford University,
where he teaches French and Italian; he sent her a text, ``The
Names of the Dead,'' that he wrote for the fall 1997 issue of
Critical Inquiry, a scholarly journal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You read things and they confirm a direction you're going,''
Ms. Hamilton said. When she sees something particularly resonant,
she may share it with friends. ``I have eight inches of faxed
fragments,'' Ms. Kline reported. Ms. Hamilton explained, ``Friends
help create permission for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in mid-February, Ms. Hamilton did not know exactly what she
would make. ``Everyone's asking me, `Do you know what you're
doing?''' she said. ``And they're all surprised when I say no. But
I've never known at this stage. In some ways, I feel I must know
somewhere in my body. Part of the process is trusting that.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days afterward, Ms. Hamilton made a second trip to Venice
with Kelly to see if her ideas felt right for the space. ``I need
to see, `Does this feel right, now that I'm here?''' she said a few
days before leaving. ``When I come back, I need to have a direct
plan and put some things in production.''
</P>
<P>
   While there, the cold prevented her from spending too long
inside the pavilion, but she walked around and around it, kept warm
by her movement, looking at it from different perspectives. She
took photographs and measurements. She talked to the architects who
were fixing the ceilings. ``I wrote down a lot of words,'' she
said. For fun, ``we ate simply great meals.''
</P>
<P>
   On the airplane back, Ms. Hamilton reflected; she felt that some
of her feelings had been affirmed, others not. She vetoed an idea
about a piece of paper falling, for example, and recalled the image
of a substance falling around the galleries' edges, which she
thought of on the flight to Venice. ``That's when I thought of
sifting,'' she said. ``In Venice the horizon is always shifting up
and down.''
</P>
<P>
   On her return, with her ideas jelling, Ms. Hamilton buckled down
to figuring out ``the how of it.'' On March 3, she again felt
daunted by what she had to accomplish. ``Two days ago, I was
tearing my hair out,'' she said, ``but I talked to someone and I
felt better.'' Then she felt adrenaline kicking in: ``It's a good
adrenaline.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Materials research was a top priority. ``I've spent most of my
time trying to find a powder that is nonstaining, hydrophobic,
nontoxic, not expensive, nonflammable, colorful, and has the
property of falling and catching in the air, but not leaving
particulates in the air,'' she said. ``It has taken me into this
whole world.''
</P>
<P>
   She started looking in the grocery store and soon began testing
things with screens and sifters. ``We ground up rose hips, tried
sands, chalk, starches, all sorts of herbs _ hibiscus leaves are
incredibly beautiful,'' she said. ``I got above a screen on a
ladder and sifted down.'' (Cremora, she said in an aside, fell very
beautifully, but had other problems, like absorbing moisture.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It really looked like amateur science hour in my studio,'' she
added.
</P>
<P>
   For other suggestions, she called some chemists recommended by
friends at the Fabric Workshop in Philadelphia; she called others
cold, without introduction, pulling names from the Thomas Register.
So many recommended others that she soon had ``a labyrinth'' of
sources.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hamilton learned that makeup powders had to be eliminated
because they cake, that many plastic powders don't fall properly,
that others do not bind well with color and other facts that are
not the first thing one might have imagined an artist having to
know. She settled on a vinyl powder: 20,000 pounds of it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, she was experimenting with what the powder would fall
on: Braille, or a cursive writing she had designed for another
project? How high in relief should the dots, or the writing, be?
There were more experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hamilton had also being doing ``extensive'' research on
weather, but she said it did not turn into anything. ``I think
where that has gone is into the presence of voice,'' she continued.
``I will experiment with the recording of whispering from speakers
that aren't visible, but coming like wind. Weather comes from a lot
of things that are invisible to us.''
</P>
<P>
   She also still had to search for a mechanical system that would
sift powder from above. With help from technical advisers, she
found an auger system that could fit flush against a wall, no easy
trick, and could operate on the Italian electricity system. That
required a trip to New Jersey for tests.
</P>
<P>
   Next came work to figure out the size of the holes, the spacing
between them and the pace of the system. The plan is to gently
parcel out 10,000 pounds of the powder over eight hours. (At night,
a vacuum system will sweep up the superfluous powder, which will be
screened and recycled.)
</P>
<P>
   With the mechanical aspects in place, Ms. Hamilton made the
final selections of her text, worked out plans to transfer Braille
dots one by one to the pavilion's walls and began recording the
Lincoln address.
</P>
<P>
   But she was not yet certain that the work was finished. So she
prepared a final gesture, a six-foot-long wooden table with
``massive, big fat legs'' into which she cut slots. Between them,
she plans to suspend knotted white cloth. ``I sense it will be in
the courtyard,'' she said in early May, not quite sure.
</P>
<P>
   By Ms. Hamilton's clock, there was plenty of time to decide once
she saw how her designs came together into a whole in Venice. It
all has to be in place by 9 a.m. on June 9, when the press and
special guests of the Biennale are allowed in for the first look at
the work of participating artists from 59 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hamilton is hoping, she said, that people will be perplexed
and intrigued by ``Myein.'' She worries a little because ``the
piece is best experienced when there aren't crowds,'' an unlikely
occurrence at the Biennale.
</P>
<P>
   But her supporters are confident. ``This piece looks back in a
kind of lament for all the lives and losses that have been
experienced,'' said Ms. Kline. ``Yet it has a sense of redemption,
too, a sense of possibility. It's completely magical and
mysterious.''

 &HT;    Georgia captures NCAA tennis championship
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Disproving the old theorem that the whole is equal
to the sum of its parts, top-seeded UCLA's parts were much more
efficient, smoother, stronger, faster and individually better than
those of Georgia, but nobody put a measure on the Bulldogs' heart.
</P>
<P>
   The scrappy Bulldogs, who were underdogs in talent in as many as
five of the six singles in the finals of the men's NCAA Tennis
Championships Tuesday, proved that sometimes a team effort can
overcome a talent deficiency and Georgia stormed back from behind
to take their third national championship, stopping the No. 1
Bruins 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Spotting the Bulldogs a point by uncharacteristically losing the
doubles point to start the match, the Bruins rocketed out to a
quick start in the singles action, winning straight-sets matches at
No. 2 and No. 5 to take a 2-1 lead. On court No. 2, UCLA freshman
Zack Fleishman stopped Georgia's Talito Corrales 6-3, 6-3, and
Brandon Kramer defeated UGA's Adam Seri 6-2, 7-5 to give the Bruins
a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs rally began with Chad Carlson when the sophomore
from Mableton ousted Jason Cook in straight sets, 6-4, 7-6, at No.
3 singles to hand the Bulldogs a 2-2 tie with three singles matches
still to finish.
</P>
<P>
   On the No. 1 court, UCLA's Jean-Noel Grinda, ranked seventh
nationally, needed three sets but disposed of Georgia's
eighth-ranked Hisham Hemeda 6-4, 6-7 (7-4), 6-4, and UCLA led 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   The deciding points were then relegated to the unlikely
territory on No. 4 and No. 6 courts, where Georgia's Joey Pitts had
come back from a first-set loss to tie UCLA's Jong Min-Lee at No. 4
and on No. 6 where Michael Lang dropped the first set to UCLA's
Marcin Rozpedski, but came back to take the second.
</P>
<P>
   Both Georgia players took early services break in the deciding
third sets knowing that the Bulldogs needed both points to take
their third national title.
</P>
<P>
   Lang was the first to finish, breaking Rozpedski's 17-match win
streak, taking a 2-6, 7-6 (7-4), 6-2 and the score was tied at 3
with Pitts and Min-Lee still playing. But not for long. Pitts broke
Min-Lee in the final game and pulled out a 5-7, 6-3, 6-2 win to
give Georgia its third national title.

ADVERTISING COLUMN: OVERTONES OF THE UNDERWORLD
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., N.J., Calif.)   (jw) 
 BY STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Madison Avenue is getting mobbed up, as gangster and
Mafia imagery and language become increasingly common in
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of campaigns are centered on godfathers,
goodfellas and wiseguys, toughs who talk in patois heavily accented
in the dese-dem-dose tones of the Northeast and dress in sleeveless
undershirts and pinstriped suits. The cornucopia of Corleone
wannabes appears in commercials and print ads and on World Wide Web
sites pitching a variety of products and services in addition to
promoting films and television series with organized-crime themes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're borrowing a recognizability,'' said Dawn Hudson, senior
vice president for strategy and marketing at the Pepsi-Cola Co &UR; . &LR; 
unit of Pepsico Inc. in Purchase, N.Y. ``People get it because they
bring a history to it.''
</P>
<P>
   For the company's flagship soda, a commercial by the BBDO New
York unit of Omnicom Group features the voice of Marlon Brando
emanating from a girl angered that the owner of a pizzeria served
her Coca-Cola instead of Pepsi-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   ``You insulted me and my entire family by offering me this,''
the Brando voice complains as music evocative of gangster movies
plays in the background.
</P>
<P>
   The campaigns are indicative of a widespread belief among agency
executives that stereotyped characters and situations are useful
devices because familiarity breeds contentment among consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are visual symbols that have become part of the cultural
vernacular,'' said Dean Stefanides, partner and creative director
at Hampel/Stefanides in New York, ``so all you have to do is see
the image and you get what we're trying to communicate.''
</P>
<P>
   For Monzu, a restaurant in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan
that serves Italian-French cuisine, Hampel/Stefanides created a
print ad showing a dead mobster sprawled on the floor of a barber
shop, a baguette clutched in his hand. The caption reads
``Sicilian, with a French twist.''
</P>
<P>
   As that example attests, crime-themed campaigns are almost
always meant to be humorous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mafia is getting into advertising because the carting
industry is downsizing,'' said Michael Dweck, chairman and creative
director at Dweck Inc. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   For Top Driver, a driving school, Dweck created a series of
spots intended to mock the instructors employed by competitors. In
one commercial, a thug-like instructor clad all in black asks his
young student for help in disposing of a bulky wrapped object _
resembling a body bag _ in the trunk of the car being used for the
driving lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really 'preciate this,'' the instructor says as he and the
student toss the object into an oversized trash receptacle. ``I
consider you a friend, you hear?''
</P>
<P>
   That use of ``friend,'' mimicking the term uttered by mob
members identifying each other in films like ``Donnie Brasco,'' is
typical in campaigns like these. There are innumerable invocations
of such gangster catch phrases from movies, TV shows and books as
``sleep with the fishes'' and ``it's only business.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, newspaper ads for ``Analyze This,'' the comic film
about a mobster undergoing therapy, used this headline to promote
sneak previews: ``Consider this an offer you can't refuse.''
</P>
<P>
   ```The Godfather' proved there's interest in the subject
matter,'' said Brad Ball, president for domestic theatrical
marketing at Warner Brothers in Burbank, Calif., the unit of Time
Warner Inc. that distributed ``Analyze This.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he added, the studio sought to avoid being ``cliche
driven'' in the campaign because ``as with any good marketing
effort, we wanted to show what's different about this picture, so
people see it as fresh instead of corny.'' As a result, subsequent
ads played down the mob lingo and carried headlines like ``What's
everybody laughing at?''
</P>
<P>
   The developers of an interactive campaign tied to ``The
Sopranos'' _ the series about a New Jersey mobster and his
families, presented by the HBO cable TV unit of Time Warner _ also
sought to serve up their gangsters in an original way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to make sure the show was seen in its own right and
not as an echo of something else,'' said Kevin Dowdell, vice
president for interactive ventures at HBO in New York, who worked
on a series Web site (www.hbo.com/sopranos) with Diane Jakacki,
executive producer at HBO.com.
</P>
<P>
   A contest offering prizes like ``Sopranos'' posters, hats and
T-shirts (``If anybody asks, they fell off a truck'') ends on June
9, when HBO starts reruns of the series.
</P>
<P>
   Are there any deterrents to the trend that can stop it the way
the Untouchables stopped Chicago bootleggers? One potential problem
is negative reaction from consumers who perceive gangland sendups
as slurs on Italian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Bruno Brugnatelli, president at Brugnatelli &AMP;
Partners Advertising in Elmsford, N.Y., sent a reporter a copy of a
letter to Pepsico complaining that the Brando Pepsi-Cola commercial
amounted to ``character assassination that is used to promote
commercial products.''
</P>
<P>
   Another possible difficulty is the association of gangsters,
even comic stereotyped gangsters, with violence. That could hurt if
protests against violent content in entertainment mount in the wake
of school shootings. Already, CBS has shelved a drama series for
the 1999-2000 season, ``Falcone,'' that was to be a TV version of
``Donnie Brasco.''
</P>
<P>
   If those problems don't derail the mob bang wagon, what could be
next? Peter Drakoulias, partner and business development director
at Deutsch Inc. in New York, has long promoted the idea of a cable
TV network devoted to gangster- and crime-related programming,
which could of course also feature compatible commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Drakoulias has even named the network: the Wiseguy Channel.

ALASKA AIR, MECHANICS AGREE ON NEW BARGAINING PROCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL NYHAN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Alaska Airlines Inc. has created a bargaining process
with its mechanics that both sides say could help the airline avoid
the lengthy disputes that forced it to cancel hundreds of flights
in the past few months.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Alaska Airlines struck a tentative deal with more
than 1,000 mechanics and technicians that would create a binding
arbitration process for future negotiations. During the next round
of talks, if the two sides can't settle their differences after 120
days they will be forced to submit to arbitration by an impartial
party on a set of issues, such as pay rates .
</P>
<P>
   The idea, known as interest arbitration, holds the promise of
shortening labor negotiations that can drag on for several years.
So far this year, Alaska Airlines has struggled to negotiate four
contracts and the disputes have disrupted services. In fact, Alaska
Airlines claimed that many of the more than 600 flights it has
canceled since April 26 were the result of a alleged slowdown by
mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the International Association of Machinists and
Aerospace Workers, who are locked in separate and contentious talks
with Alaska Airline on behalf of baggage, freight handlers and
stock clerks, have already expressed interest in the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they offered (the proposal) it would help on the next go
around of negotiations,'' said Stephen Stanczyk,
secretary-treasurer of the International Association of Machinists
and Aerospace Workers' Local 2202. The talks would be ``over and
done by a specific date.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanczyk, however, said the approach will not jumpstart the
effort to renegotiate its current contract. The talks have stalled,
in part, because of disagreements over wage increases and other
benefits changes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some union officials may also be wary of the new approach,
because they could lose one of their most powerful tools, the
ability to strike, according to Glenn Engel, an airline analyst for
Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think management seems much more willing to move to this
model than labor,'' Engel said. ``Labor feels they get more by
using the strike threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, U.S. investors welcomed the news that Alaska Airlines,
the 10th-largest U.S. carrier, had settled its longest running
labor dispute. The stock of Alaska Air Group Inc., which owns
Alaska Airlines, surged to 39 11/16, up 1 9/16, during a day when
the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 123.58.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mechanics have been slowing the airline down. It is
probably the reason why the stock has underperformed,'' Engel said.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association must
still ratify their contract, and a vote is expected in the next
three weeks. The union's local airline representative, Louie Key,
however, has already said he will recommend that members endorse
the $30 million package, which contains an across-the-board wage
increase, and other benefits increases.
</P>
<P>
   While Alaska's negotiations with its ramp service and stock
clerks have run aground, the company is making progress on the
other two contracts with its flight attendants and clerical
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mood at our table is really quite good,'' said Thomas
Lent, a representative at the National Association of Flight
Attendants. Lent added that he is confident the two sides could
strike a tentative deal by July 30.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines president and chief executive officer John Kelly
has also said the company will likely settle its contract with
representatives of the clerical workers.

BUSH CRITICAL OF CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S RESPONSE TO CHINESE
SPYING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush switched gears from governor
to presidential candidate Tuesday, sharply criticizing the Clinton
administration for what he called a slow, insufficient response to
reports of Chinese theft of U.S. nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The balance of power is going to shift as a result of this,
and it is going to accelerate China's emergence as a nuclear
power,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's quick reaction to a congressional report outlining
Chinese spying was a marked contrast to the slow and public
deliberations he undertook in taking a stand on NATO's intervention
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on Clinton also occurred as Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore were in South Texas promoting Gore's bid for the
Democratic presidential nomination. Clinton had made attacks on a
China policy a major element of his 1992 defeat of Bush's father,
former President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bush, so far the front-runner for the 2000 Republican
presidential nomination, acknowledged the report's note that
Chinese spying has been going on since the late 1970s, including
the 12 years his father was vice president and president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate that China has been stealing secrets during
Carter, Reagan, Bush and Clinton (administrations). But there has
only been one administration that has been given the news, only one
administration knew. And that is the Clinton administration,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor noted the evidence that Clinton's national security
staff has known about Chinese spying for several years without
acting on the information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should I run and should be the president, I can assure you
that (if) my national security adviser knew that secrets were being
stolen, I would want to know about it, and I would do something
about it immediately,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   One of Bush's GOP opponents, Elizabeth Dole, echoed Bush's
criticism of inaction by the Clinton administration. But Dole also
said ``previous administrations must share in the blame.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the United States needs to ``reassess our relationship
with China'' and that future presidents must be ``firm and
consistent'' in dealing with the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush, whose father also was U.S. ambassador to China and CIA
director, continued to support the admission of the People's
Republican of China into the World Trade Organization and opening
China up to U.S. producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two are not inconsistent. We can have trade with China, so
long as we have firm export controls to make sure we're not trading
technology that will become part of a Chinese nuclear arsenal,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Another of Bush's GOP rivals, Steve Forbes, demanded an
immediate halt to efforts to get China into the World Trade
Organization. Forbes said the lost secrets show a need to
immediately renew research of missile defense systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton-Gore administrations's national security policy of
hear no evil, see no evil and speak no evil has deeply wounded the
U.S.'s ability to defend itself,'' Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential hopefuls Gary Bauer and Lamar Alexander
also criticized the current administration.
</P>
<P>
   But Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley, who hopes to
wrest the party nomination from Vice President Al Gore, chose not
to join in the criticism of the administration during a
fund-raising visit Tuesday to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason to turn China into an enemy,'' said the
former U.S. senator from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley had not yet read the congressional report, but said
safeguards to protect nuclear secrets should be improved and that
those involved should be punished swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   In criticizing the administration, Bush self-consciously
admitted that he was breaking his self-imposed vow to concentrate
on Texas until the Legislature ends next Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But he said a congressional report on Chinese espionage was so
significant that as a potential presidential candidate ``I thought
it was important to make a clear statement of my view.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been trying to rapidly establish his foreign policy
credentials, meeting several times with policy advisers.
</P>
<P>
   But the difficulty of a governor campaigning on foreign policy
issues was illustrated in 1992 when Bush's father likened Clinton's
foreign policy experience to that of the Bush family dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton-Gore, they've got about as much foreign policy
experience as Millie,'' President Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton attacked Bush's open trade policies, saying the
president was not doing enough to force the Chinese government to
protect human rights.
</P>
<P>
   But since Clinton has been in office, there have been questions
of possible trade security lapses that have allowed U.S. technology
to leak to China as a result of financial contributions to
Clinton's re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the nuclear secrets leaks are believed to have occurred
at U.S. research laboratories.

 &HT;    Bush blames Clinton administration for leaks to ChineseBy Ken
Herman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Sounding more like a presidential candidate than
ever, Gov. George W. Bush on Tuesday moved quickly to stake out a
position on the congressional report on Chinese espionage.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, on other issues, Bush has taken some heat for
being cautiously evasive on presidential campaign issues. On
Tuesday, armed with a prepared statement, Bush jumped in shortly
after U.S. Rep. Christopher Cox issued a 700-page report detailing
Chinese theft of U.S. nuclear weapon technology.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who plans to formally announce his candidacy later this
summer, placed the blame squarely on ``the current
administration,'' a phrase targeted to include Vice President Al
Gore, his potential 2000 opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also allowed room for some blame of previous
administrations, including his father's. But, without mentioning
President Clinton by name during his statement, the candidate-to-be
came down hardest on the current White House resident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's report also shines a glaring light on the current
administration's failed policies toward China,'' said Bush.
``Presented with detailed information about China's espionage, the
administration apparently did not take it seriously, did not react
promptly and is still trying to minimize the scope and extent of
the damage done.''
</P>
<P>
   His quick and decisive comments stood in sharp contrast to the
way he handled his position on another recent foreign policy
question: U.S. troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In March, after Clinton committed troops to the United
Nations-led effort in the Balkans, Bush took heavy criticism for
not weighing in on the decision right away and for being vague in
his comments when he did finally take a stand.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said Tuesday he chose to speak out on the Cox
report because ``I thought it was important to make a clear
statement of my views.'' Bush made his comments after a ceremony in
which he signed into a law a bill prohibiting juveniles who commit
crimes with guns from being released until they appear before a
judge.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of waiting for questions from reporters, Bush took a
proactive stance, announcing at the outset of the ceremony that he
wanted to remark afterward on a Washington issue of importance to
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said later that the governor was
more circumspect about Kosovo because the United States had troops
at risk. She also said Bush has been following the Chinese spying
situation closely and felt obligated to speak out.
``Increasingly,'' she said, ``he will be speaking out more on
issues that have implications for America.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush noted that the report ``makes it clear that for the past 20
years, including the last few years, China has systematically
stolen American nuclear secrets and is after other military
technologies as well.'' The result, according to Bush, has been
thefts that ``have dramatically accelerated China's emergence as a
major nuclear power.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The implications are huge for the balance of power in Asia and
for the balance of power in the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if blame must be shared by other presidents during that
20-year period, Bush said, ``It's unfortunate that China has been
stealing secrets during Carter, Reagan, Bush and Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was only but one administration that has been given the
news,'' he said. ``Only one administration knew, and that's the
Clinton administration. . . I readily concede previous
administrations did not know what was going on. And that is a
problem with U.S. security. Step one is to make sure our security
is tightened at all facilities at which there are sensitive
technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said if he runs and wins ``I can assure you that if my
national security adviser knew that secrets were being stolen that
I would want to know about it and I would do something about it
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the decades of espionage, Bush does not favor economic
punishment of China to through trade embargoes. He remains a
free-trade proponent who believes commerce can change nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is also important for us to realize that the
development of an entrepreneurial class in China will enhance
freedom in that part of the world,'' said Bush, who believes China
should be admitted to the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the Clinton administration has it all wrong when it
refers to China as a ``strategic partner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``China is not America's strategic partner,'' said Bush. ``China
is a competitor, a competitor which does not share our values but
now, unfortunately, shares many of our nuclear secrets.''

MOTHER, THREE SONS KILLED BY TRAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ AND RICHARD WEIZEL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAIRFIELD, Conn _ In total darkness, an Ecuadorian immigrant
followed the railroad tracks, her four young sons by her side.
Carrying children's books, a Bible, and toys stuffed in knapsacks,
the family trudged toward the local commuter station early Tuesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   But looming behind them was an Amtrak train, one that moved
stealthily under electric power. The family could not hear the
muffled rumblings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her last act was an attempt to save her child, that much we
know,'' Metropolitan Transit Authority Police Chief James O'Donnell
said later.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the conductor spotted the human shadows, it was too
late.
</P>
<P>
   The horn blared as the mother rushed to scoop up her children.
She grabbed three, but the fourth darted to the other side of the
tracks. In the seconds before the train sped through, the boy raced
across, to get to his family's side, said O'Donnell. The mother
reached out to pull him. But they ran out of time.
</P>
<P>
   The train slammed into them at more than 70 miles per hour,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   The mother and three of the sons died instantly. One of the
boys, 6-year-old Angel Gabriel Urgiles Toledo, is on life support
at nearby Bridgeport Hospital, suffering from major head trauma.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the mother was in her mid-40s, had immigrated from
Ecuador and had been living in East Bridgeport for about two years.
She was a resident alien, meaning she had a ``green card'' which
permitted her to work in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The children were enrolled in Luis Munoz Marin Elementary School
in a predominantly Latino neighborhood. Her husband was back in
Ecuador; police had not reached him by Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Many neighbors, along with police, could only speculate as to
why the mother was walking alone with her children on the railroad
tracks at night. Some people speculated that the woman must have
been running away from some form of threat or abuse, but police and
other officials said they didn't know if that was the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no evidence that has been uncovered yet,'' said
Fairfield First Selectman Ken Flatto. ``But there may have been a
housing problem.'' Flatto stopped short of saying the family was
homeless.
</P>
<P>
   The accident happened at 2:20 a.m., a few hundred yards from the
Fairfield commuter rail station, the place the family seemed to be
heading, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The station is near the middle of downtown Fairfield, a
picturesque and affluent waterfront suburb of 53,000, just an hour
from New York City. The town borders Bridgeport, the state's
largest, and one of its poorest, cities.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth J. Gambardella, rail safety coordinator for the
Connecticut Department of Transportation, said the accident scene
was ``the most horrific, horrifying I have witnessed in the 15
years I have been on the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Gambardella agreed with O'Donnell that there was no way the
engineer could have stopped the train in time to avoid the
accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 75 miles per hour, which is the speed limit for that track,
it would take a mile or more to stop,'' said Gambardella.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday afternoon, yellow police tape trailed along
finely-manicured shrubs surrounding the outer perimeter of the
tracks. The train, carrying 210 passengers, remained near the
station for at least two hours. The front of the train was covered
in blood.
</P>
<P>
   When paramedics found Angel unconscious, they took him to
Bridgeport Hospital. The train had severed his left leg, up to the
knee, and inflicted a wound to his skull.
</P>
<P>
   Surgeons opened a three-inch hole in the front right side of his
skull to relieve brain swelling, said Dr. Nabil Atweh, who operated
on Angel for more than three hours as neurosurgeons worked on his
leg.
</P>
<P>
   Atweh said that while Angel remained in life-threatening
condition, he was doing somewhat better than expected. His blood
pressure had improved and he responds to pain stimulus, but the
brain pressure remains very high.
</P>
<P>
   An uncle and two aunts watch over the boy, on monitoring devices
in a pediatric intensive care unit, as medical staff stand by to
keep him alive.

BRAZIL MARKETS DOWN AS TRANSCRIPTS WIDEN GOVERNMENT SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Already weakened by concern over troubling
economic developments in neighboring Argentina, Brazilian markets
reeled for a second day following new developments in a scandal
over the government's handling of the privatization of the
country's telecommunications monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   After a nearly 5 percent loss Monday, stocks fell 4.95 percent
on Tuesday on the publication of previously unreported telephone
conversations between Cabinet ministers and President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso. The conversations suggest Cardoso's
administration used public institutions and public financing to
improperly manipulate the July 1998 auction of pieces of the
monopoly, known as Telebras.
</P>
<P>
   The transcripts, from 46 tapes, were published in Folha de S.
Paulo, Brazil's largest newspaper, and the tapes were released on
the newspaper's Internet site. Copies quickly spread to radio
broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   They reveal the government apparently worked in conjunction with
a Rio de Janeiro-based investment company with close ties to
high-ranking officials to enable a consortium led by the company to
purchase part of Telebras. The consortium ultimately lost in its
bid to buy a prized subsidiary of Telebras, although it succeeded
in purchasing other parts of the phone system, which was sold for a
total of more than $22 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations are not new, having first been revealed at the
end of last year. Yet the tapes released on Tuesday indicate
Cardoso, until now untouched by the scandal, may have become
personally involved. In one tape Cardoso, asked by a top aide for
permission to invoke the president's influence to convince a
powerful pension fund to enter one consortium, responded, ``Don't
have doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   Angry over the tapes, Cardoso released a statement from the
presidential palace that said reports about them were
``sensationalist'' and ``obscured the fundamental facts.'' But the
government did not refute the veracity of the conversations and
said they were probably recorded illegally. It was unclear Tuesday
night how the newspaper obtained the tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the very least this damages the dignity of the
presidency,'' said Celso Bandeira de Mello, a law professor who has
often criticized official economic policies and who was disparaged
as a ``monkey'' by one government minister in the tapes. ``In
thesis there is the possibility the president broke the law by not
being neutral.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said it was doubtful that Cardoso or his ministers broke
any laws. ``The possibility of the president personally gaining
anything from all of this is quite small,'' said Ives Gandra da
Silva Martins, another well-known legal scholar.
</P>
<P>
   The government's position on the scandal since it first began to
unfold in November is that its role was in the public's best
interest for public institutions to be used to affect the outcome
of the privatization auction so the national treasury could collect
as much money as possible from the sale of Telebras.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did what we could to ensure a successful privatization,''
Jose Pio Borges, the current president of the National Development
Bank, told reporters in Rio de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Cardoso administration has successfully managed
the world's most wide-reaching privatization program since 1994,
auctioning off everything from railroads to electric utilities, the
uproar over the tapes highlights how large a role the government
still plays in the economy. Banco do Brasil, the country's largest
bank, is still state-controlled, as is the Petrobras oil
conglomerate and the pension funds for the two companies, which
together with other government-linked pension entities form the
largest domestic source of investment capital.
</P>
<P>
   Leftist political leaders, who have been opposed to the
government's privatization program, called for a congressional
inquiry into the taped conversations. Coupled with another probe
into the government's handling of a tumultuous currency devaluation
in January, the possibility of a new investigation could lead to
concern over Cardoso's ability to convince Congress to approve
spending cuts and new tax legislation, widely viewed as critical to
Brazil's long-term economic health.

BOSTON HIRES LAWYERS TO PREPARE SUIT AGAINST GUN MAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE EBBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Riding the nation's wave of antigun sentiment, the
city of Boston intends to hire three heavy-hitting law firms to
file a $100 million lawsuit against gun manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Boston could file as early as this week, becoming the 19th
municipality in the country to sue gun manufacturers and
distributors, after six California cities and two counties joined
the mounting battle Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Straddling the legal theories put forth in claims first filed in
Chicago and New Orleans, Boston will argue that the gun industry
has been negligent in the marketing and distribution of unsafe
products. It also argues that the loose distribution _ particularly
trafficking from states where guns are more readily accessible _
creates a public nuisance, costing the city not only in police,
hospital, and emergency services, but also in dwindling quality of
life and property values in crime-ridden neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of such litigation hope the rising pressure on the
industry and the costs of legal defense will force gunmakers to
bend to broader safety measures and a clampdown on slipshod
distribution.
</P>
<P>
   At a moment of widening schisms within the industry, the school
shooting in Littleton, Colo., and Congress' grappling with the
slippery issue of gun control, officials in Boston think their case
is particularly ripe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems that this is a good time in the country in that there
really has been a shift in both public opinion and the perspective
of policymakers that something is seriously wrong with the
availabilty of guns, and we need to try some new approaches,'' said
John Auerbach, director of the Boston Public Health Commission,
which is spearheading the legal challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Industry representatives, however, maintain the suits are
politically motivated measures that don't recognize the compromises
already made by manufacturers _ including voluntary safety locks,
background checks at gun shows, and a permanent ban on gun
ownership for juveniles with violent records.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our response is, get in line,'' said Jack Adkins, director of
operations for the American Sports Shooting Council, an industry
trade group. ``What's new? It's old news now.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Thomas M. Menino, he said, ``is not going to get any more
out of this industry than the first mayor that filed the lawsuit as
far as financial gain.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, manufacturers argue that cities like Boston have
demonstrated success in reducing crime without antigun measures,
rendering their arguments useless.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's homicide rate has plummeted to 35 last year from 152 in
1990, and 12 in the first five months of 1999. The homicide rate
since 1997 has been lower than any time since 1961.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got these states that already have severe restrictions
on firearms ownership,'' Adkins said. ``Crime doesn't really seem
to be an issue anymore . . . but it's the feeding frenzy as a
result of the tobacco legislation which has now opened the door up
to the next politically correct industry, which happens to be
firearms.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Los Angeles and San Francisco announced they would sue
the gun industry, in conjunction with four other California cities
and two counties. Gun litigation also has been lodged by New
Orleans; Chicago; Miami-Dade County, Fla.; Bridgeport, Conn.;
Cleveland; Atlanta; Cincinnati; Detroit and Wayne County, Mich.;
and St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   After Menino threatened the gun industry with the suit last
fall, the city tread water for a time, due to corporation counsel
Merita Hopkins' concern that the massive undertaking would drain
city resources and staff time, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   City attorneys then embarked on a long search for cocounsel
willing to take on the costly project. Brown Rudnick Freed &AMP;
Geesmer, which led the state's suit against tobacco companies, have
agreed to take on the case, after retreating from talks for a time.
</P>
<P>
   Partner Tom Sobol said the legal team includes Sullivan,
Weinstein &AMP; McQuay of Boston; Lieff, Cabraser, Heimann &AMP; Bernstein
of San Francisco and New York, a leader in diet-pill and
breast-implant suits and partner in the national tobacco
settlement; and Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld &AMP; Toll of Washington. The
Legal Action Project of the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence
Center is also cooperating with the city.
</P>
<P>
   The firms would receive a percentage of proceeds from any
settlement, which would pale in comparison to the sums available
through deep-pocketed tobacco companies. Sobol said the partnership
can absorb the expense of filing the suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that when a laudable public health goal is the reward
of the litigation, one's got to be willing to accept and take the
risks,'' said Sobol.
</P>
<P>
   The city's deliberative effort has included an exhaustive probe
of every shooting injury reported in the city over six years. The
suit will target 25 manufacturers and distributors, including Smith
&AMP; Wesson, Glock, Colt, Bryco, Sundance, Kel-Tec, Mossberg, Taurus,
and Interarms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't intend to lose. We're entering this to win,'' said
Peter Welsh, the mayor's director of policy and planning. ``By
waiting and hopefully signing a deal with some of the top law firms
in the country, we're increasing our chances dramatically.''

 &HT;    Mrs. Gore speaks of husband's accomplishments in Bush's
backyardBy Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In a preseason preview of what could be the 2000
presidential showdown, Gov. George W. Bush's top political aide and
Vice President Al Gore's wife are offering wildly different views
on what the last eight years could mean to the election.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Rove, Bush's longtime strategist, says Gore could pay for
the sins of his president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at the end of eight years of a party dominating the
White House. ... We are at the end of a presidency where people
really want to see it in the rear-view mirror,'' Rove said in a
recent interview. ``Whether they want to admit it or not, they want
it in the rear-view mirror. There is a desire for change.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so, said Tipper Gore, who raised money Tuesday for the Gore
campaign while her husband toured South Texas to tout
administration programs that have promoted economic growth in the
poverty-ridden Rio Grande Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward, and I know that my husband is,'' Mrs.
Gore told the Austin American-Statesman. ``He's talking about a
bold vision for the future of the country and how we need to
prepare to move into the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if we take a look at what's been accomplished by the
administration in these eight years we are very proud of the
economic prosperity people are enjoying.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gore's comments came between Austin fund-raising events and
after she toured Lifeworks, a South Austin-based program that
offers youth and family services. She also attended a midday
fund-raiser at a downtown hotel and spoke at a dinner at the home
of Austin attorney Bill Whitehurst. The evening event raised about
$60,000. Overall, the Gore campaign hoped to raise about $900,000
during five Texas events Tuesday and today.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gore made no mention of Bush during her two speeches here.
But Bush was targeted by people who introduced her. Jane Hickie, a
former aide to Bush's predecessor, Gov. Ann Richards, told Mrs.
Gore to report that there are Austinites ``who are going to be very
happy that we are going to have our candidate for president who is
qualified to become the commander-in-chief on day one, and who has
travelled places other than to Mexico and to Israel to apologize
for the suggestion that only some people get to go to heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Her comment referred to Bush's recounting of a discussion he,
his mother and The Rev. Billy Graham once had about whether heaven
is open to people who do not accept Jesus Christ. Bush has said he
makes no judgments on the topic. The Anti-Defamation League has
said Bush's comments were not offensive to Jews.
</P>
<P>
   In South Texas, Gore presided over a White House conference
reviewing ``empowerment zones'' launched as part of a 1993 economic
recovery that was opposed by congressional Republicans. The program
provides grants, tax incentives and bonding authority to
economically distressed areas. Clinton was on hand to introduce
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   As Gore campaigned in South Texas, his only apparent competition
for the Democratic nomination, former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley,
visited El Paso and Houston. He campaigned with former Texas state
Comptroller John Sharp, who once worked on Gore's ``reinventing
government'' program to cut bureaucracy, will be his Texas campaign
chairman.Ken Herman writes for the Austin American-Statesman,

SPLIT SENATE CLEARS 2 OFFICERS BLAMED FOR PEARL HARBOR
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By PHILIP SHENON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate voted Tuesday to clear the names of the
two senior military officers who were accused of dereliction of
duty as a result of the bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941. The vote
came after an emotional debate among the dwindling number of World
War II veterans left in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The vote, 52-47 on an amendment to the $289 billion military
spending bill, was intended to exonerate Adm. Husband Kimmel and
Lt. Gen. Walter Short, the American military commanders in Hawaii
who were blamed for failing to anticipate the devastating Japanese
attack on Dec. 7, 1941.
</P>
<P>
   After the surprise attack, the two men were relieved of their
commands and forced to retire from the military at reduced ranks,
their reputations in tatters. A panel created by President Franklin
D. Roosevelt accused them of dereliction of duty. Both died decades
ago.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 57 years since one of the nation's worst military
disasters, a number of historians have described Kimmel and Short
as scapegoats for failures among military commanders in Washington
who were aware of intelligence reports suggesting an imminent
Japanese attack.
</P>
<P>
   The intelligence, gathered in late 1941 from decoded Japanese
radio interceptions, was not passed on to commanders in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no longer any reason to perpetuate the cruel myth
that Kimmel and Short were singularly responsible for the disaster
at Pearl Harbor,'' said Sen. William Roth Jr., R-Del., who has led
the struggle to clear the names of the two officers and restore
their wartime ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were denied vital intelligence that was available in
Washington,'' said Roth, who served in the Army in World War II and
is now 77 years. ``We're not rewriting history. We're just
correcting the record.''
</P>
<P>
   Roth was pressed to offer the amendment by Kimmel's only
surviving son, Thomas, who is a constituent. The House is expected
to consider the amendment when it reviews the military spending
bill.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments did not sway another veteran of the war, Sen. John
Warner, R-Va., 72, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, who
strongly opposed the amendment from Roth and his Democratic
colleague from Delaware, Sen. Joseph Biden Jr..
</P>
<P>
   Describing the Senate's action Tuesday as ``tombstone
promotions,'' Warner noted that several formal government
investigations of Pearl Harbor had not cleared the names of Kimmel
and Short.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are faced with here is one generation trying to
provide revisionist history upon another,'' Warner said.
</P>
<P>
   Warner, who volunteered for the Navy in 1944 as a teen-ager and
is a decorated veteran of the Korean War, said it was long
tradition in the armed forces for commanders to be held ``directly
accountable'' for the safety of troops under their commands.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Pentagon study of Pearl Harbor, conducted in 1995 at
the request of Congress, found that fault for the attack went well
beyond Kimmel and Short and should be ``broadly shared.''
</P>
<P>

MYSTERY GROWS OVER PAYMENT BY MORGAN STANLEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Many people on Wall Street are scratching their heads
as to why Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, America's largest securities
firm, would pay $10,000 to a middleman who helped secure the arrest
of a former employee. Now, it turns out, even the middleman had
doubts.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Joseph Luethke, the middleman, early this year asked
Morgan Stanley for instructions on how to return $10,000 paid to
him by the firm within days of the employee's arrest, a
confidential document shows. Luethke says that he decided in the
weeks after last August's sting operation against the former
employee that he wanted to sever his financial ties to Morgan
Stanley and distance himself from the cash payment.
</P>
<P>
   That claim is supported in a letter sent by certified mail to
Luethke by John Cooney Jr., a Morgan Stanley lawyer at Davis, Polk,
Wardwell, a Manhattan law firm. The letter, dated Jan. 11, 1999,
stated that Luethke has ``mentioned his interest in repaying the
$10,000 which was given to you by Morgan Stanley.'' It includes the
number of a Morgan Stanley account at Citibank. The letter was made
available to The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   The letter appears to be part of a dialogue between Morgan
Stanley and Luethke, 29, whose murky role in the complex affair is
at the center of an investigation by the Manhattan district
attorney. That investigation had been focused on Christian Curry,
the former employee. But last week, the district attorney's office
said it was dropping all charges against Curry and instead was
making both Morgan Stanley and Luethke subjects of the
investigation. So far, no criminal charges have been brought.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between Luethke and Morgan Stanley is full of
innuendo, accusations and denials, but it is the linchpin in a huge
discrimination suit filed last week against the firm by Curry. The
lawsuit contends that high-level employees at Morgan Stanley,
including the chairman and chief executive, Philip Purcell, worked
closely with Luethke to plan a sting operation against Curry. Curry
had been fired shortly before and was contemplating a racial
discrimination suit against the firm.
</P>
<P>
   The letter to Luethke is the first tangible evidence that Morgan
Stanley paid $10,000 to Luethke, who acknowledges a role in
brokering the sting operation. It also supports Luethke's
contention that he has held an ongoing dialogue with Morgan Stanley
lawyers that continued many months after that $10,000 payment was
made. He maintains that to this day lawyers working for Morgan
Stanley are seeking to pressure or cajole him to keep silent in the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very eager to work out some kind of arrangement with
me,'' Luethke said Tuesday. ``They have also told me that if I
don't stay silent, they will crush me like a bug. On numerous
occasions they said that: `Crush me like a bug.'''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley, which says it is cooperating with law
enforcement officials, has repeatedly declined to explain the
$10,000 payment publicly. On Tuesday, Martin London, a lawyer for
Davis Polk &AMP; Wardwell who also represents Morgan Stanley,
reiterated that stance. But he added that Luethke was not to be
trusted, and that Luethke's accounts of communications with Morgan
Stanley ``should not be accepted as accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley's contention is echoed by other parties involved
in the case, including lawyers involved in the district attorney's
investigation and Curry, a college acquaintance of Luethke. All say
that Luethke has misled them on more than one occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Even the authorities have had some trouble detecting fact from
fiction. Last September, the district attorney arrested Luethke and
charged him with two crimes. One was a misdemeanor charge of
harassing Curry's girlfriend, Marissa Wheeler. Another was a felony
count of possessing a false identification card that showed him
holding the rank of lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army.
</P>
<P>
   Both charges are still outstanding. On Tuesday, Ms. Wheeler,
Curry's girlfriend, was interviewed by officials in the district
attorney's office who were seeking to get to the bottom of
harassment charges against Luethke.
</P>
<P>
   Even pinning down Luethke's school record proves difficult. He
says he was a full-time student at Columbia. But records at the
school show he was enrolled as a part-time student in general
studies for one semester in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Luethke insists he has told the truth all along and says he is
innocent of all charges.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his credibility, the prevailing mystery in the story is
why Morgan Stanley nursed a relationship of any kind with Luethke,
who has never been an employee of the firm and has no financial
training. Lawyers involved in the investigation say they suspect
that Morgan Stanley was so desperate to avoid being hit with a
racial discrimination suit by Curry, who comes from a
well-connected black family in New York, that it agreed to work
with Luethke to discredit Curry.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley has said that Curry was fired for abusing his
expense account. But his dismissal came several days after photos
of him appeared in a gay pornographic magazine. Curry insists that
he is not a homosexual, and that the photos were taken two years
earlier and showed up in the magazine without his consent. He says
that his dismissal is evidence of discrimination on the basis of
perceived sexual orientation. He has also alleged racial
discrimination at Morgan Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding the nature and chronology of Luethke's
relationship with Morgan Stanley is difficult, in part because
Luethke himself often speaks abstractly, even referring to
``Luethke'' and the ``confidential informant'' in the third person.
The district attorney's office has had no direct contact with
Luethke in months and considers him unreliable, lawyers involved in
the matter said. But the lawyers said that to their knowledge, the
district attorney's office never saw the Jan. 11 letter to Luethke.

 &HT;    Kosovar family exchanges war for North Georgia tranquillity
 &HT;    (EDS: CORRECTED VERSION.)
 &HT;    By Christy Oglesby and Rebecca McCarthy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Just a few weeks ago, the Hoxha family fled the terror
of war, murder and ethnic expulsion in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Today they will awaken to the tranquillity of a Christian refuge
in North Georgia. Tomorrow, the schedule calls for English lessons
and grocery shopping.
</P>
<P>
   The humanitarian crisis in Yugoslavia reached Georgia in a
tangible way Tuesday afternoon. Hundreds of thousands of ethnic
Albanians have fled the province of Kosovo. The Hoxhas _ two
parents and three children _ arrived at Hartsfield International
Airport, becoming the first refugees from the Balkans conflict to
reach this area.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds more are expected to arrive in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   The Hoxhas stepped off the 737 from Newark into Atlanta _ and a
frenzy of media attention. They seemed at ease answering reporters'
questions. The exception was 20-year-old Arben, who nervously
tapped his heel on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The trip _ from Kosovo to Macedonia to New Jersey to Georgia _
was ``long and very, very difficult,'' said Ilir Hoxha, the father.
``We would like to thank the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia, in turn, has opened its arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting more offers of help than we can use,'' said Don
Mosley of Jubilee Partners, a Christian community in Comer, Ga.
where the refugees will live for the next two months. ``We really
don't have any place to store any more help.''
</P>
<P>
   The family lived in Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, where Ilir
Hoxha was a musical producer for a television station before being
booted out of his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very hard life there,'' he said through an Albanian
translator. ``They forced us to leave our house. Every moment we
waited, our lives were in danger.''
</P>
<P>
   The family includes two daughters _ Teuta, who is 15, and
Arbreshe, 17.
</P>
<P>
   After collecting their luggage _ new clothes given them at Fort
Dix, N.J., because they fled with only what they were wearing _ the
Hoxhas climbed into a van and were driven to Jubilee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a healing place,'' said Jennifer Drago, Jubilee's refugee
program coordinator. She was waiting at the airport with a sign
that read ``welcome'' in Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   The people of Jubilee had been preparing for this day. A
traditional home-cooked Kosovar meal of meats and dough was waiting
for the refugees, and staff at Jubilee had stocked their house with
familiar kinds of food.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a 50-pound bag of flour waiting for them,'' Drago
said. ``They do lots of bread. And there's yeast, fruit and
chicken. And vegeta _ it's like bouillon cubes. They use that to
season meats.''
</P>
<P>
   When the red van carrying the Hoxhas topped the hill near the
Jubilee driveway, Mosley began waving and smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Staff members and their families waved and held aloft a large
sign saying ``Mire es na vini,'' the Albanian equivalent of
``welcome.'' The Hoxhas and their children shook hands with most of
the 25 or so people who live year-round at Jubilee.
</P>
<P>
   Ilir Hoxha, in an atmosphere less pressured than at the airport,
told of being pushed out of his home by Serbian paramilitary
members in March. The three-mile route that his family was forced
to walk to the train station was lined with masked, armed soldiers,
but Hoxha didn't look at them. The family kept their eyes focused
on the ground the entire way.
</P>
<P>
   When they boarded the train, Hoxha said, they didn't know where
they were going or what would happen to them _ they only knew they
would be killed if they stayed. They were dumped off the train just
inside the Macedonian border, where they slept on the ground, in
the rain, for seven days, with no shelter or provisions, before
moving into a refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
   Their harrowing exit from Kosovo capped 10 years of oppression
and mistreatment by Serbians, Hoxha said.
</P>
<P>
   Fired from her clerical job with a branch of the Kosovar
government, his wife, Hyshije, didn't work for five years, until
she landed a job in the University of Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   By 7:30 Tuesday night, the Hoxhas were showing their fatigue,
having been traveling most of the day. The meaty aroma of the
Albanian dinner prepared by the translator's wife wafted into the
parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   The family looked at the clear blue sky, the rustling trees and
the smiling faces of their hosts, then headed off to supper.

CHINA UNVEILS PLAN TO OVERHAUL DEBT-RIDDEN GUANGDONG ENTERPRISES 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Softening its tone toward foreign lenders, China on
Tuesday announced a plan to overhaul a debt-ridden state company,
with the banks and the government sharing the losses.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Guangdong Enterprises, is staggering under $5.6
billion in debt and other liabilities. It stopped making loan
payments in t January, after its owner, Guangdong province's
government, announced that it would overhaul operations with the
help of Goldman, Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   China's handling of Guangdong Enterprises is in stark contrast
to its treatment of another troubled state company, Guangdong
International Trust and Investment, known as Gitic. When Gitic
capsized under $4.3 billion in debt last October, Beijing forced it
into bankruptcy and told banks that they would lose most of their
loans.
</P>
<P>
   As the next-most-prominent Chinese corporate casualty, Guangdong
Enterprises has been scrutinized by foreign banks as a test of how
unforgiving the government will be in cleaning up troubled state
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this one went badly, it would have spelled trouble for
creditors generally in China,'' said Gordon G. Chang, a bankruptcy
lawyer in the Beijing office of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &AMP;
Garrison.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, officials of Goldman, Sachs and of Guangdong
outlined a plan for Guangdong Enterprises. It would recapitalize
the company's main Hong Kong subsidiary by selling the subsidiary a
profitable water business. The plan would also swap equity for a
portion of the parent company's debt and would carve out $238
million of bad loans and place them in an asset management company.
</P>
<P>
   In what amounts to a grand exercise in financial triage, the
Chinese government would revive the healthiest parts of Guangdong
Enterprises while asking the banks to accept losses on the
hopelessly sick parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be a mutual sharing of loss,'' said Wang Qishan,
the executive vice governor of Guangdong province, at a news
conference after he presented the plan to several hundred creditors
in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   While Guangdong Enterprises' creditors said in a statement that
the plan was ``not satisfactory on initial inspection,'' their
relief seemed palpable. ``It's definitely an OK place to start
negotiating,'' said Ted Osborn, a partner at
PricewaterhouseCoopers, which is advising the creditors. ``The
Guangdong government didn't have to give anything; these companies
are bankrupt.''
</P>
<P>
   Osborn said the creditors would certainly negotiate on the finer
points of the proposal, such as how to value the debt-for-equity
swaps and the water plant that the Guangdong government would
contribute to Guangdong Enterprises' publicly listed Hong Kong
flagship, Guangdong Investments Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   But he added: ``The Guangdong government has put down its
marker. Now at least the banks know where they stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman, Sachs, which has labored since January to make sense of
Guangdong Enterprises' tangled finances, said that if the new stock
issued to the creditors performed well, some of them could wind up
with no losses over the long term.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no forced loss for any of the creditors _ none,''
said Steven M. Shafran, a Goldman managing director in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Shafran was particularly enthusiastic about China's contribution
of the Dongshen Water Supply Co., which supplies 75 percent of Hong
Kong's water and which he said was worth more than $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Still, creditors are skeptical about Guangdong Enterprises,
given that many of its assets are in sad shape and some former
executives are suspected of corruption. One executive who advises
the creditors estimated that the plan would result in 20 percent to
40 percent losses to the banks on their loans.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Gitic, the banks are likely to recover less than
20 percent of their loans. Wang said that if the government had
chosen to liquidate Guangdong Enterprises, its banks would have
received a similarly paltry return.
</P>
<P>
   As with Gitic, Guangdong Enterprises' creditors are a who's who
of global financial institutions, including Sumitomo Bank,
Citigroup, Banque Nationale de Paris and Deutsche Bank. All told,
Chinese, Japanese and French have greater exposure than U.S. banks.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gitic and Guangdong Enterprises bear similarities,
there are crucial differences. Gitic is an investment trust
company, while Guangdong Enterprises is a state-owned enterprise
whose main subsidiary is a ``red chip'' company listed on the Hong
Kong Stock Exchange. The Chinese prime minister, Zhu Rongji, has
expressed his distaste for investment trusts, which he contends are
outmoded vehicles to raise capital.
</P>
<P>
   Red chips, on the other hand, remain China's most dependable way
to tap global capital markets. Wang said he took special care with
Guangdong Enterprises because he did not want to throw Hong Kong's
red-chip market into turmoil. Shares in Hong Kong eased on Tuesday,
as investors waited for the Guangdong Enterprises proposal to be
announced, after having risen Monday as initial details of the plan
leaked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of the province,'' Wang said, ``we feel we should
make a contribution to the stability of Hong Kong.''
</P>
<P>
   Wang, who was appointed last year by the prime minister to rein
in the freewheeling financial practices in Guangdong province, gave
a freewheeling performance of his own Tuesday. By turns playful and
scolding, he reiterated Zhu's campaign to reform China's economy
and banks.
</P>
<P>
   And he switched seamlessly between free-market evangelist and
dutiful party functionary.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether China would suffer more corporate failures, Wang
said, ``The fundamental principle of a market economy is that the
winners win and the losers lose.''

IMPACT OF SUDDEN GUILTY PLEA UNCLEAR FOR OTHER DEFENDANTS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Until now, the spotlight in the Abner Louima trial
has largely been on the actions of Officer Justin Volpe. But with
Volpe's guilty plea Tuesday, the focus of the explosive case shifts
immediately to the three other officers and a sergeant still on
trial.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the evidence presented against them ranges from
relatively substantial to seemingly flimsy. And people close to the
case say the prosecution has largely presented the heart of its
evidence against three of the four.
</P>
<P>
   But now the remaining defendants have one more thing to contend
with: Volpe's guilty plea. Although it is common for jurors not to
be told that a defendant's disappearance from a trial was the
result of a guilty plea, it appeared Tuesday that the Louima jurors
might be told of Volpe's plea when the trial resumed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   John Patten, the lawyer for Sgt. Michael Bellomo, one of the
remaining defendants, said he believed that the plea could be so
harmful to his client that he planned to ask the judge Wednesday
morning to declare a mistrial in his client's case so that he might
be tried anew.
</P>
<P>
   Yet one of the defense lawyers and some legal experts said that
Volpe's guilty plea cut both ways.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, they said, the jurors may subconsciously
believe that if he pleaded guilty, the other defendants must also
be guilty, and the evidence presented against him may linger beyond
his presence to taint the remaining defendants.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, they say, with the most notorious defendant _
the man whom the prosecution has portrayed as Louima's chief
brutalizer _ standing convicted, the jurors may resolve any doubts
about the evidence against the remaining defendants in favor of
those defendants, believing that justice has been done.
</P>
<P>
   One thing seems clear: Volpe is highly unlikely to appear as a
witness for either side. His guilty plea does not involve a deal
with the prosecution, which last week rebuffed his overture for a
plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Although Volpe made statements while pleading guilty Tuesday
that seemed helpful to two of the remaining defendants, Officer
Charles Schwarz and Sgt. Michael Bellomo, lawyers for both of these
men swiftly made clear that they considered Volpe poison.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz is charged with holding Louima down in the restroom
while Volpe tortured him with the stick. But in giving his account
of the restroom attack to Judge Eugene Nickerson of U.S. District
Court in Brooklyn, Volpe said the other officer in there _ whom
Volpe did not name _ merely ``saw what was going on'' and ``did
nothing to stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   While this ascribes a far lesser role to the other officer _ and
while people familiar with Volpe's full account say the other
officer is not Schwarz _ Schwarz's lawyer said emphatically that he
had no plans to call Volpe as a witness for Schwarz, despite his
seemingly helpful account. ``Justin Volpe _ the man who has
admitted torturing an individual?'' the lawyer, Stephen Worth
declared, making clear his belief that Volpe's testimony would be
damaging, even if his words would seem to help Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
   Bellomo is charged with trying to cover up another assault
against Louima _ what prosecutors have described as a beating in a
police car _ and Volpe's assault of a second man, Patrick Antoine,
by arresting him on false charges. But Volpe told the judge on
Tuesday that he had ``no understanding with Sgt. Bellomo'' about a
cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   The sergeant's lawyer, John Patten, said that while he would
``love to have'' Volpe's testimony on that point, ``at the same
time I think he's damaged goods.''
</P>
<P>
   Patten, in saying that he planned to ask the judge to declare a
mistrial Wednesday for Bellomo, added that with Volpe's having
pleaded guilty, the jurors would think that ``everything Louima
ever said is true.''
</P>
<P>
   While the jurors were not in court Tuesday to see Volpe plead
guilty, the prosecution and the defense were seeking to work out an
agreement Tuesday under which Nickerson would tell the jurors of
Volpe's plea, but not of the charges he pleaded guilty to or what
he said in court Tuesday. The judge would further instruct the
jurors that they were not to consider his plea as evidence of the
remaining defendants' guilt.

 &HT;    State officials dismayed over size of budget shortfall
 &HT;    By Lynn Hulsey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The first strong sign of financial trouble at
Dayton City Schools came a year ago when administrators canceled
purchase orders in order to balance the budget, Assistant
Superintendent Carol Hauser said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But district officials failed to make budget cuts needed to head
off a June 30 deficit estimated at $19 million, Hauser said, and
only now are canceling all non-essential purchases and looking to
borrow money, transfer funds and put off some financial obligations
to make it through the end of the school year.
</P>
<P>
   Officials are also considering long-term cuts and may close five
school buildings, outsource busing and cut staff.
</P>
<P>
   School officials are still trying to determine how they ended up
spending $213 million instead of the $181 million budgeted in June
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Carryover funds from last year and unexpected revenue kept the
deficit from growing even larger when the district failed to cut
staff in response to declining enrollment, Hauser said.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of a damning state audit of the district's finances
and performance, a local legislator said he may propose a law to
allow the Dayton City Commission to take temporary control of the
city's public school system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are just terrible, terrible figures,'' said State Rep.
Robert Corbin (R-Washington Twp.), citing auditors' conclusions
that Dayton's deficit could rise to $40 million by 2003 unless
officials take corrective measures.
</P>
<P>
   State Auditor Jim Petro issued the first state-mandated
performance audit of Dayton schools on Monday. The audit showed
that although the school board had approved a budget surplus for
fiscal year 1999, the district actually faces a $14 million
deficit. Updated projections by the district's new budget director,
Jan Schultz, put that figure at $19 million. She discovered the
shortfall after she took over from former budget director Judy Peck
in February. Schultz said she does not know how the looming deficit
escaped school officials' notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only speculate. I cannot provide an answer for that,''
said Schultz. ``I look at things differently than the past budget
director.''
</P>
<P>
   Petro slammed the district's financial planning, record keeping
and business practices. The audit also found Dayton teachers
instructing far below the maximum levels of instructional time
allowed by their contracts. Auditors noted high levels of
absenteeism by drivers, teachers and non-teaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   The audit prompted County Auditor A.J. Wagner to question the
district's official certificate of estimated resources, approved by
the three-member County Budget Commission in March. Wagner,
Montgomery County Prosecutor Mathias H. Heck and Montgomery County
Treasurer Hugh Quill make up the commission. They will ask district
treasurer Kennon Goff to clarify documents that seem to conflict
with Petro's findings. Wagner said it is the first time the
commission has had to make that kind of request.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never encountered a surprise like this,'' said Wagner,
expressing disbelief that Dayton schools did not have a better
system of checks and balances to catch budget mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``As fiscal officer of the county, all kinds of bells and
whistles would be going on, actually years before now, that we were
approaching trouble,'' Wagner said.
</P>
<P>
   School board members are dismayed at the size of the deficit.
They say Superintendent James A. Williams had been assuring them
since January that financial problems were under control.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were being given wrong answers or no answers,'' said Ricky
Boyd, board vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Board member Nancy Brown said she did not trust Williams'
assurances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got hesitant answers from (Treasurer) Ken (Goff) so I
suspected that everything was not right,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she is not ready to see Goff leave the district but
``would not be unhappy'' if Williams were to find another job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he owes us some explanations but I don't think we're
going to get them,'' said Brown. ``I think he doesn't think he owes
us any.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said Monday he is not to blame for the budget shortfall
because his staff gave him inaccurate information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not taking this beating,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams and Goff did not return calls on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Board members said both Williams and Goff will answer to them
during their evaluations in June. Goff has a year left on his
contract and Williams has a contract through July 31, 2000.
Williams gets an automatic two-year extension unless the board
issues written notice of unsatisfactory performance by Aug. 16.
</P>
<P>
   Board member Clayton Luckie said firing both men is an option.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fourteen million dollars in debt right now is very serious and
I'm not ruling out anything,'' Luckie said.
</P>
<P>
   In Columbus, Corbin said he has discussed with House Republicans
introducing legislation to allow city government to take control of
a struggling or unresponsive school district, hire and fire
employees, close schools and freeze salaries for a year.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leadership in the House did not embrace Corbin's idea,
deeming it ``too controversial,'' Corbin said.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. J. Donald Mottley, R-West Carrollton, said such
legislation would likely face constitutional challenges if it
became law. Mottley said current state law allows for outside
takeover of a school district with chronic financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Charles Horn, R-Centerville, said Corbin's idea ``is
worth discussion,'' but added that he would ``have to think twice''
before turning districts over to some city commissions or councils
in Ohio, because of the potential for the problems to become even
more politicized.
</P>
<P>
   Mottley called the audit projections ``a great surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason it was such a shock is that there is a perception
of Dayton as one of the better-run districts,'' Mottley said. ``I
personally have a certain degree of confidence that at the
administrative level, they'll get on top of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Mottley, Horn and Corbin all said the revelations in the Dayton
audit illustrate the wisdom of legislators' insistence on the
state's 21 largest districts undergoing performance audits.
</P>
<P>
   In response to claims by Dayton school officials that they are
losing enrollment to charter schools, Gov. Bob Taft said Dayton
schools must do a better job if they want to keep students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a challenge of Dayton schools to improve the
product they're offering and attract students,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If the schools face budget cuts, Taft said, they should not
emphasize protecting jobs or school buildings over classroom
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not providing education just to perpetuate certain
schools,'' he said. ``It is to educate children.''

SAMPRAS, CHASING HISTORY, REFUSES TO FADE AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ On his first match point on Tuesday, Pete Sampras soared
like Superman to hit a forehand stretch volley that would have
ended his first-round ordeal at the French Open. But Sampras wound
up on his belly in the red dirt as his shot, and his noble
intentions, buried themselves in the net.
</P>
<P>
   So he soldiered on.
</P>
<P>
   On his second match point, Sampras, covered with clay,
double-faulted on the 18th point of the fourth-set tie breaker. He
then glared in disgust as his dogged opponent, 88th-ranked Juan
Antonio Marin of Costa Rica, sent their standoff into a fifth set
by converting his eighth set point with a forehand that glanced off
the corner tape.
</P>
<P>
   So Sampras, very much against his will, soldiered on a little
longer and eventually won the war.
</P>
<P>
   Another French Open, another torturous outing for Sampras, the
man who would love to become a king of clay but continues to fumble
around like a court jester on the stuff of his Grand Slam
nightmares. A title here at Roland Garros, the only Grand Slam
tournament to confound him, would bring the 27-year-old Californian
a 12th Grand Slam crown and tie him with Roy Emerson's career
record. But Sampras knows better than to focus on that finish line.
Now, in his 10th year here, he has advanced no closer than the 1996
semifinals, and merely surviving the opening round has required
something close to an act of God.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday it took him forever, or 4 hours 18 minutes _ which
felt like one and the same thing to Sampras _ to escape from Round
1 with a 6-7 (10-12), 6-4, 7-5, 6-7 (9-11), 6-4 victory. Sampras
and Marin began in stark sunshine and concluded with center court
shrouded by evening shadows.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's the fifth set, it comes down to the heart, and
obviously I wanted to win this match, want to do well here,'' said
Sampras, now 23-9 at Roland Garros and 27-10 in career
five-setters. ``It's a tough way to open, but I got through it,
that's the bottom line. It's welcome to Paris, I guess.
</P>
<P>
   ``How did I survive it? Grace of God, I guess,'' said Sampras,
who also gave thanks for his serve, with the exception of a few
ill-timed double faults. ``At match point is not recommended,'' he
joked. ``Losing that fourth-set tie breaker kind of killed me a
little bit, but the fact that I hung in there, it pleases me. It's
never good to play four and a half hours in the first round, but
I'm still alive.''
</P>
<P>
   In the final set, Sampras and Marin traded early breaks, then
Sampras, after holding for 5-4, hunkered down and ambushed his
intrepid challenger in the 10th game. Though his hangdog body
language and frequent knee bends hinted at physical distress,
Sampras had closure on his mind. He brought the game to deuce with
a forehand pass, pelted a buoyant forehand winner into the corner
for his third match point and ended the marathon with another bold
forehand that provoked a halfhearted backhand into the net from
Marin.
</P>
<P>
   ``That last game he played well; any mistake you make, and it's
the match,'' said Marin, who dismissed the notion that Sampras
performs on clay with all the ease of a fish in a frying pan.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I play indoors or on grass, I'm not gonna
serve-and-volley,'' said Marin, a tried and true baseliner. ``Maybe
on this surface he's not as good as on other surfaces, but he
knows. He's been six years No. 1; he knows what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras littered the match with 74 unforced errors, including 14
double faults, the most consequential of them the angry double
fault that spoiled his first match point and the double fault, his
fourth of the match, that gave Marin possession of the tie breaker
in their 52-minute opening set.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy can play some really good tennis, came out and made me
work extremely hard and probably should have beaten me,'' said
Sampras, who faces Andrei Medvedev next. ``If I'm going to lose,
I'm going to lose playing my way. I just told myself this year I'm
going to come in, be aggressive. Today I just kind of hung in there
and scrapped it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared with Sampras, the other top seeded players in action on
this sunny afternoon advanced without much scrapping or trauma:
Gustavo Kuerten, the eighth-seeded Brazilian who won his first
career title here in 1997 and is heralded as this year's favorite,
put on a clay court clinic and annihilated Galo Blanco of Spain,
6-4, 6-4, 6-3. Patrick Rafter, the runner-up to Kuerten last week
at the Italian Open and the third-seeded man here, topped Roger
Federer of Switzerland, 5-7, 6-3, 6-0, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening act on the center court program, the five-time
champion Steffi Graf thrashed Magdalena Maleeva of Bulgaria, 6-2,
6-0. Lindsay Davenport, seeded second, disposed of 67th-ranked Jane
Chi, 6-3, 6-1, and last year's runner-up, Monica Seles, seeded
third, overwhelmed Fang Li of China, 6-2, 6-4. Mary Pierce, seeded
eighth, gave Joannette Kruger of South Africa a 6-4, 6-3 pounding
and then acknowledged that part of her power comes with the help of
creatine, the controversial training supplement favored by weight
lifters and baseball players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a science person, but it just helps you recover
quicker and build lean muscle mass, just gives you a little bit of
extra energy,'' she said. ``It's been a very small part of my
supplementation and training, probably 3 percent.''

   MATCH POINTS
</P>
<P>
   The short list of seeded players who lost was headed by
10th-seeded Mark Philippoussis, last year's U.S. Open runner-up,
who continues to sputter on clay. As his paltry trio of aces
testified, the big-serving Australian lacked his necessary
artillery and fell to his countryman Jason Stoltenberg, 7-6 (7-4),
6-4, 6-1. The loser's 63 unforced errors included 16 double faults.
The other seeded man to depart was 11th-seeded Karol Kucera of
Slovakia, who made his fifth first-round exit in seven visits.
Kucera was ousted, 6-2, 6-3, 6-2, by Magnus Larsson of Sweden. On
the women's side, 14th-seeded Amanda Coetzer was dispatched by Ai
Sugiyama, 7-5, 6-1. ... Jennifer Capriati, who won her first title
in six and a half years at Strasbourg on Saturday, defeated
Virginia Ruano-Pascual of Spain, 6-2, 6-3.

ANTHONY P. RIOS, 84, AN ORGANIZER IN POLITICS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: California)   (dal) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anthony P. Rios, a veteran political organizer among Hispanic
Californians, died on May 19 at Kaiser Permanente Hospital in
Baldwin Park, a suburb of Los Angeles. He was 84 and lived in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Rios joined Saul Alinsky, the Chicago sociologist and organizer,
in founding the Community Service Organization in California in
1947. Their purpose was to marshal Hispanic Californians and turn
them into a political and social force to reckon with.
</P>
<P>
   He was a mentor to former Rep. Edward R. Roybal, a social worker
and public-health educator whose political career the group
championed. Roybal won election to the Los Angeles City Council in
1949 and went on to Washington in 1963, where he stayed until 1992,
serving in important committee posts and as chairman of the
Congressional Hispanic Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Rios, a native of Calexico, Calif., and a former labor organizer
himself, was also an early supporter of Cesar Chavez and his
campaign to organize farm workers in California. Rios started
organizing as a teen-ager in the 1930s when he and his fellow lemon
pickers were left without jobs in the winters. He became involved
in organizing steelworkers in Los Angeles and, in 1947, helped to
form the a group that rallied people to register and vote.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next decades the organization inspired chapters across
California, especially in rural areas. Chavez, a migrant worker,
became active in the movement in 1952 and was serving as its
general director in 1962, when he left to form the United Farm
Workers union.
</P>
<P>
   As the Community Service Organization grew, Rios' long-term goal
remained what it had been at the start, involving Hispanic
residents in the political process.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Rosie Vasquez; three daughters,
Geraldine, of Montebello, Calif., Senda, of Hayward, and Donna, of
San Luis Obispo; two sons, Fernando, of Whittier, and Tony Jr., of
Los Angeles; a brother, Armando; 10 grandchildren; and six
great-grandchildren.

MCKESSON EARNINGS REVISION SENDS STOCK PLUNGING
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In what is becoming a serial calamity, McKesson HBOC
Inc. announced Tuesday that it would make further revisions to its
fiscal and quarterly earnings because of improperly recorded sales
at HBO &AMP; Co., a software maker it acquired in January.
</P>
<P>
   The news frightened investors, who quickly sold the stock.
Shares of McKesson dropped 12.3 percent, or $4.6875, Tuesday to
close at $33.50, barely above its 52-week low. McKesson's stock
plunged nearly 48 percent last month when it first announced
accounting irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's announcement, released early in the morning in a terse
statement, raised the ire of investors and analysts alike.
McKesson, the nation's largest drug wholesaler, said last month
that it had found $42.2 million in sales transactions that had not
been fully completed.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the company insisted that the audit should go back
only one year. But Tuesday, McKesson said that additional instances
of improper revenue recognition had been discovered and that
results for prior years at HBO might have to be restated.
</P>
<P>
   As with many dealings with McKesson in the last year, this one
comes with its share of complexities. Analysts, for example, openly
pondered the future of Charles McCall, McKesson's chairman, and
Mark Pulido, the chief executive, after neither man was quoted in
Tuesday's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board of directors at McKesson has clearly taken control
of the company,'' said Mike Krensavage, an analyst with Brown
Brothers Harriman. ``The company's management has no credibility.
Heads will roll at McKesson.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Kurtz, a company spokesman, said, ``The process is still
ongoing, and I don't have a comment at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   The release did not provide any dollar amounts to the new
improper sales or say what negative effect the recalculation would
have on earnings.
</P>
<P>
   A series of large options trades has preceded each of the
McKesson announcements about its accounting woes, raising
additional questions. Around noon on Monday, 1,285 options were
traded in three transactions at prices of 62 cents to 75 cents
each. With McKesson's stock droop, those options were trading
Tuesday at $2.25, a gain of 200 percent. A week before McKesson's
first announcement last month, some 1,400 options were traded.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that McKesson executives must have feared that
information was leaking into the financial markets and rushed out a
statement about the progress of the audit.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and investors were puzzled as to why the company was
just discovering the irregularities. When McKesson first announced
the troubles, the company said that many of the questioned sales
transactions occurred when HBO recorded the sale before the
contract for it was signed.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts accepted this explanation. McKesson even reassured
investors that many of the sales would be recorded later, once the
contingencies to these contracts had been met. But with Tuesday's
announcement, some analysts are no longer comfortable with
McKesson's explanation and have begun to suspect that the company
may have been duped by HBO.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as last summer, when McKesson first began its
acquisition talks, questions about HBO's accounting practices had
begun to surface. In two reports, one in April 1997 and another in
August 1998, the Center for Financial Research and Analysis, an
institutional research company in Rockville, Md., warned investors
that HBO was booking revenue too fast.
</P>
<P>
   Among the center's concerns was how aggressively HBO booked
sales from its long-term contracts. For example, in a 10-year
contract for $10,000, HBO could decide that it had completed
one-quarter of the contract's obligations and book $2,500 in
revenues the first year.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem, the center said, was that HBO could collect
only $1,000 that year, according to terms in the contract. While
this practice is common among software makers, the center worried
that HBO used it too often.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and investors are riled that McKesson did not catch
these accounting problems before it bought HBO. Angry investors,
many of whom have joined several class-action lawsuits against
McKesson over the battered stock price.
</P>
<P>
   With Tuesday's news, McKesson will have plenty to explain beyond
the findings in the audit. Analysts question whether the company
did its due diligence when buying HBO. With the selloff in
McKesson's stock, the market has valued HBO at nothing, making many
wonder whether the purchase was more trouble than it was worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``McKesson should have realized what was going on at HBO,'' said
Christopher Teeters, an analyst at the Center for Financial
Research and Analysis. ``Drug delivery is a cash-and-carry
business. Software doesn't work that way. When McKesson's
executives reviewed how HBO's sales work, they didn't understand
what they were looking at.''

NFL APPROVES $800-MILLION PURCHASE OF REDSKINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The tortuous, sometimes bitter, process of selling the
Washington Redskins concluded Tuesday when the National Football
League unanimously blessed the $800 million acquisition by Daniel
Snyder, a 34-year-old communications entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an incredible journey,'' said Snyder, whose company,
Snyder Communications, is in Bethesda, Md. ``I woke up this morning
and I felt strange and wonderful. I'm a fan. A huge fan. It's that
simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder and his partners, Mortimer Zuckerman and Fred Drasner,
the owners of The New York Daily News, paid more for the Redskins
than anyone before for a sports franchise, ending a process that
began last September when Jack Kent Cooke's estate put the team up
for sale.
</P>
<P>
   The league's 31 owners approved the bid in the only action taken
on the first of two days of meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder was originally a partner in a bid by Howard Milstein, the
New York real estate developer. Milstein withdrew his bid last
month and subsequently sued two Redskins officials, saying they
lobbied NFL owners against his $800 million offer, which was deemed
too debt-heavy by the league.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder brought in Zuckerman and Drasner, who have helped finance
his past business ventures, soon after Milstein unhappily backed
out. ``It came together in about a week,'' Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   He had no comment on Milstein's suit against John Kent Cooke,
the Redskins' president and son of the late owner, who bid $680
million to buy the Redskins, which his father refused to will to
him, and general manager Charley Casserly. Both denied the
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue said that in a conversation with
Milstein two or three weeks ago, ``I told him I thought the
understanding is there would be peace and no lawsuits, but he said
he felt Cooke acted improperly and I said I felt he was
misguided.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Redskins, a bedrock NFL franchise, proceed under new
ownership, the prospective owners of an expansion Los Angeles team
brought their competing plans for redeveloping the Los Angeles
Memorial Coliseum to the meeting. But the deciding factor between
plans from Michael Ovitz, the entertainment deal maker, and Eli
Broad, an insurance services billionaire, may not be luxury suites,
fountains, reflecting pools or lavish landscaping. It won't be
which man can name the members of the Fearsome Foursome fastest.
</P>
<P>
   It may all come down to parking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mission here is, how do you do parking?'' said John
Semcken, executive vice president of New Coliseum Partners, the
group formed by Broad and Ed Roski Jr., a real estate developer.
``It's boring, but it's what they asked us to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Parking is crucial because of its importance to the so-called
fan experience at the often-maligned Coliseum site, which the Rams
and the Raiders have abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz's plan calls for building 60 acres of grassy parkland
above a series of two- to five-story parking garages. There would
be 16 garage entrances, and each game ticket would designate which
one to enter. The garages would cost an estimated $225 million.
``The NFL asked us for 25,000 spots, and we've suggested 27,000,''
Ovitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Broad offered four parking options, one as expensive as $240
million to build 24,150 underground spaces, but he recommended a
modest $67 million garage with 7,500 spaces that would be added to
10,000 spaces now in place or to be built.
</P>
<P>
   ``We presented certainty,'' Semcken said. ``We feel we can get
public funding for $67 million, with all the parking revenues
dedicated to paying off the bond.''
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue all but endorsed the scope of Ovitz's stadium
redevelopment plan, which is more elaborate and grandiose than
Broad's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is exactly the kind of vision we feel is necessary to
transform the venue that is in the best interests of fans and the
city of Los Angeles,'' Tagliabue said.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue and several owners said the league hoped that Ovitz
and Broad merge. ``That would be in the best interests of the
league and the people of Los Angeles,'' said Wayne Weaver, the
owner of the Jacksonville Jaguars. ``Together they'd have a lot of
leverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Wellington Mara, the Giants' co-owner, said: ``Certainly, it
would be desirable. Each is a strong group.''
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate pessimist is Al Davis, the Raiders' chief who left
the Coliseum for Oakland. He says he believes that the Los Angeles
market is his, and that he wants to build a stadium at Hollywood
Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if they know where they're going here,'' he said.
``We're a professional football league and we're talking about
parking lots.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as Ovitz pursues ownership in Los Angeles, he said he was
not certain that local fans would flock to football after losing
two teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not 100 percent convinced they'll embrace football,'' he
said. ``There's a lot of apathy. They're up with football. If you
want to see a game, you can turn on the TV or go to San Diego. We
have to give them an appropriate facility and an appropriate
experience.''

AN UNREMARKABLE OFFICER, AN UNSPEAKABLE ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What Justin Volpe did to Abner Louima in the bathroom
of the 70th Precinct station house on Aug. 9, 1997, is now as plain
as the words Volpe spoke in court on Tuesday. Why he did it,
however, remains painfully, perhaps permanently, inscrutable.
</P>
<P>
   Other officers, and young men on the streets of the Brooklyn
neighborhood he patrolled, intimated after Volpe's arrest in 1997
that he had a short temper and an occasionally bullying demeanor.
Some acquaintances called him arrogant, an adjective consistent
with testimony that the officer boasted of his brutality.
</P>
<P>
   But the picture painted by most of those who know him was of an
unremarkable man who led an unremarkable life. He was, they say, a
dutiful teen-ager, an average cop who was by turns quiet and
sociable, who lifted weights and rode his Harley-Davidson through
the city at night.
</P>
<P>
   Justin A. Volpe was born in March 1972 in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn,
the youngest of three brothers. Shortly after his birth, the family
moved to Eltingville, on Staten Island, living in a stylishly
landscaped, two-story white wood-and-brick house _ the same one
where Volpe spent Monday night under house arrest before his plea
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Both of his parents are artists. His mother, Grace, paints and
teaches art at St. Joseph by the Sea High School on Staten Island.
His father, Robert, became a police officer _ a career move he has
often described as illogical for an artist _ but he fused his
interests by becoming a one-man unit specializing in art theft. He
retired from the force 12 years ago, after making a name for
himself by cracking a number of high-profile cases of stolen art.
</P>
<P>
   He has spent his retirement writing screenplays, painting,
lecturing _ and, for the last year and a half, maintaining his
son's innocence. As recently as a month ago, he asserted that his
youngest son was the victim of a ``modern-day lynching.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Justin and his older brother Damian followed their father
on the force. At the time of the Louima incident, Damian was also
assigned to the 70th Precinct, where he was a delegate of the
Patrolmen's Benevolent Association. He has since been transferred.
The oldest brother, Robert, who is in his 30s, also toyed with
becoming a police officer, but instead became an English teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Volpe attended St. Joseph by the Sea, and, like his two
brothers, enrolled at the Staten Island campus of St. John's
University. He joined the force in August 1993, and received his
degree in criminal justice in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from the academy, he was assigned to the
midnight shift at the 70th Precinct, where Damian worked on the day
shift. Police officials have described Justin Volpe's police record
as unexceptional. He was decorated with six medals for good police
work, mainly for arresting suspects with guns. On one occasion, in
September 1995, he was the subject of an unsubstantiated complaint
to the Civilian Complaint Review Board that he ``pinched, kicked
and cursed'' a man. Several officers familiar with him have said he
tended to be hot-tempered and arrogant.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say he's arrogant,'' Robert Volpe said after his son's
arrest. ``I say proud.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Louima incident appeared to have undercurrents of
racial bigotry, Justin Volpe was not overtly prejudiced, friends
and acquaintances said. For several years, he has dated Susan
Lawson, a black woman who was working as a clerk at the 70th
Precinct, and the two became engaged.

2 TOY MAKERS, ONE RETAILER SETTLE ANTITRUST CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DANA CANEDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Several leading players in the toy industry agreed
Tuesday to pay 44 states $50 million in cash and merchandise to
settle antitrust charges.
</P>
<P>
   Toys R Us, which was accused of orchestrating the conspiracy to
restrict competition, agreed to pay the heftiest amount _ toys with
a retail value of $27 million and $13.5 million in cash to be used
for toys, books and other educational material.
</P>
<P>
   Toys R Us, which is based in Paramus, N.J., and is one of the
largest toy retailers in the world, agreed to make the donations
and cash payment to settle a lawsuit in which attorneys general in
44 states accused the company of using its power to persuade toy
makers to limit the amount of some popular items, including Barbie
Dream House and Fisher Price Nursery Monitors, distributed to
warehouses and price clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Two manufacturers also agreed Tuesday to donate toys to settle
similar charges in the suit, filed in federal court in 1997 by the
New York attorney general's office. Mattel Inc., in El Segundo,
Calif., agreed Tuesday to pay $8.2 million in cash and toys and
Little Tikes Co. agreed to pay $1.3 million in cash and toys.
Little Tikes, a unit of Newell Rubbermaid Inc., is based in Hudson,
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The toys will be distributed to needy children by the Marine
Corps `Toys for Tots' program over three holiday seasons beginning
this year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the $50 million combined value of Tuesday's
settlement, Hasbro Inc., Pawtucket, R.I., agreed last December to
pay $6 million in cash and toys to resolve its portion of the case.
None of the companies admitted wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The donations and cash payments are intended to penalize the toy
makers and retailer for what the attorneys general say was a
far-reaching conspiracy to limit distribution and restrict
consumers' ability to compare prices. The companies are expected to
claim tax deductions to reflect their costs.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, which is subject to court approval, is
nonetheless a victory for consumers, according to the New York
state attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, who took over the case
brought in federal court by his predecessor, Dennis Vacco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although toy makers and sellers like to view themselves as
Santa's helpers, in this case these companies were nothing more
than modern-day Scrooges,'' Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   Toys R Us said it settled the suit to avoid protracted
litigation. As part of the agreement, New York will receive $2.2
million in toys and $850,000 in cash, which will be used to provide
books and other educational material to needy youngsters. Overall,
the toys will go to children in all 50 states, Washington and
Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   The product mix is at the discretion of the companies within
certain guidelines. ``The bottom line is they wanted as much leeway
as possible to decide which toys went and the states tried to rein
them in on that,'' said Linda Gargiulo, an assistant attorney
general in New York who was involved in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the donated goods must include toys for girls as
well as boys, and items for children of all ages. The goods must be
among items currently for sale at Toys R Us and cannot include
recalled items or products that depict violence.
</P>
<P>
   The price of individual items was left largely to the discretion
of the companies. Only 10 percent, however, can be of a value
greater than $30 so that the donation will generate enough toys to
distribute to a large number of children.
</P>
<P>
   Toys R Us said it had not decided what toys to donate but ``I
think we will try to put together a broad selection of toys,'' said
Rebecca Caruso, a company spokeswoman.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A long-awaited congressional report that details a
pattern of systematic and successful Chinese espionage to learn
American nuclear secrets was released Tuesday, President Clinton
said he agreed that national security should be improved.
</P>
<P>
   The contents of the report, which had begun seeping out in
recent days, were unanimously approved by the five Republicans and
four Democrats on the Select Committee on U.S. National Security
and Military/Commercial Concerns with the People's Republic of
China.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at an event in Texas, the president praised the
committee's ``careful and bipartisan'' approach and said his
administration agreed with the `the overwhelming majority'' of the
report's 38 recommendations, which call for strengthening
intelligence, security and export control programs.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the politically sensitive investigation has already
added new strains in relations between the United States and China,
which has denied any espionage. The committee's criticisms of the
Clinton administration's policy of easing technology exports to
improve political relations could also become a campaign issue. The
report already drew a call from House Majority Leader Richard Armey
for the resignation of the president's national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The 909 page, three-volume report concludes that China has
stolen design secrets for all seven nuclear warheads currently
deployed on American missiles, enabling Beijing to leap years ahead
and modernize its nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The ``systematic'' Chinese espionage began 20 years ago and
almost certainly continues today, but it has not immediately
altered the strategic balance between Washington and Beijing,
according to the report. Still, the committee warns that China is
exploiting stolen U.S. design secrets to develop a modernized and
more mobile nuclear capability that could threaten U.S. troops and
allies in the Asian-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the committee's battle to maintain its bipartisan
spirit, at Tuesday's unveiling, one of the Democrats on the panel
questioned a key conclusion of the report, that the thefts had put
China's nuclear weapons design information on a par with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The report contains new details of recent Chinese nuclear
espionage. It also criticizes the export policies of the Clinton
administration and the practices of two American satellite
companies _ Hughes Space and Communications International Inc. and
Loral Space and Communications Ltd. _ for sometimes subordinating
national security to the ``bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   And it offers a new view into efforts by the Chinese military to
funnel money to a Democratic fund-raiser in 1996. The report
concludes that the money given by a Chinese military officer, Liu
Choa-ying, who met President Clinton at a fund-raiser in 1996,
``was an attempt to better her position in the United States to
acquire computer, missile and satellite technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday's crowded news conference, members of the committee
took pains to maintain a united front, stressing how issues of
national security took priority over partisan rancor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our final report shows Congress can work well together,'' said
Christopher Cox, the California Republican who chaired the panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris Cox and I agreed that nine members could be Americans
first, putting aside partisan considerations,'' said Norm Dicks of
Washington, the ranking Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   However, another Democratic member, Rep. John M. Spratt, Jr., of
South Carolina, questioned the accuracy of the report's alarming
finding that stolen American nuclear secrets had put China's
nuclear weapons design capabilities ``on a par with our own.''
</P>
<P>
   In his Texas remarks, the president also pledged to work with
Congress to protect national security and continue his policy of
engagement with Beijing. His promise to improve security was backed
up by Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who said, ``I am trying to
clean up a mess.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton and his administration were criticized by two
Republicans seeking a Presidential nomination, George W. Bush and
Elizabeth Dole, both of whom said he should have reacted more
quickly to initial reports of Chinese spying.
</P>
<P>
   At its core, the report tells two intertwined stories: China's
``insatiable'' appetite for American technology to upgrade its
military capability and Washington's laxity over sensitive exports
and security at the nation's weapons laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   The committee began its inquiry looking at a narrow subjectwhat
was China learning from American companies who used Chinese rockets
to launch satellites? But midway into its inquiry the committee
discovered the nuclear espionage, which became its most serious
avenue. In recent weeks, the report and the leaks of some of the
report's discovery of Chinese nuclear espionage have caused a furor
in Congress. In advance of the report, the White House made a point
of emphasizing that the leaks of nuclear secrets from the weapons
laboratories happened under Republican and Democratic
administrations.
</P>
<P>
   The report criticizes loosened controls on exports of sensitive
technologies, a cornerstone of Clinton's trade policies and
commercial diplomacy, but does not pinpoint blame for the two
decades of lax security at the weapons laboratories. But a
principal finding of the committee is that the United States did
not become ``fully aware of the magnitude of the problem'' until
1995.
</P>
<P>
   The committee interviewed some 150 witnesses and reviewed
500,000 pages of documents. But it criticized the cooperation it
received from the Clinton administration and two satellite
manufacturers. Specific complaints in the report include the
failure of some Cabinet departments to turn over some documents or
allow some interviews, a premature tip off by the Central
Intelligence Agency that acted as an ``impediment'' in one area,
and Berger's answer _ which took 40 days _ to a written question
about when Clinton was informed about China's nuclear spying.
</P>
<P>
   Berger originally told the committee that the president was
informed in early 1998. But this month, long after the report was
completed, Berger changed his account and said he briefed Clinton
in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A senior aide to Berger attributed the delay and inaccuracy to
poor staff work and distractions from U.S. bombing of Iraq, which
began a few days before Berger's reply.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The committee relied on Berger's first account, noting that the
president was not briefed until early 1998 ``even though'' the
depth of the problem was first uncovered by intelligence officials
in 1995. The officials then briefed Berger in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Berger is not considering Armey's request that he resign, a
White House aide said. Other Republicans and even some Democrats
have also sharply faulted Attorney General Janet Reno and the
Justice Department's handling of the espionage investigation.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 percent of the report remains classified. The version
made public often uses words such as ``may'' or ``could'' or
``possibly.'' Cox said that is a byproduct of the declassification
process, which kept some details secret in order to protect
intelligence gathering methods and law enforcement investigations
</P>
<P>
   Some of the report's findings and conclusions about China
include the following:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Chinese government has some 3,000 ``front'' companies in
the United States, but U.S. agencies have little knowledge about
their existence or activities. In the 1990s, China stepped up its
use of front companies for espionage.
</P>
<P>
   _ China stole unspecified thermonuclear weapons information,
possibly from a national weapons laboratory, in the mid 1990s. This
is in addition to China's acquisition of design secrets on seven
U.S. nuclear warheads, including the neutron bomb and the W-88, the
most advanced, miniaturized warhead.
</P>
<P>
   _ China has also stolen information relating to American
re-entry vehicles, which shield warheads as they re-enter the
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   _ China illegally obtained ballistic missile guidance technology
which it has subsequently exploited for its own weapons.
</P>
<P>
   _ China illegally obtained U.S. research and development work on
electromagnetic weapons technology related to satellites in the
late 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   _ China's agreement to allow checks on its use of American
exports, announced at the presidential summit in Beijing in 1998,
is ``wholly inadequate'' in general and ``useless'' in the case of
advanced computers.
</P>
<P>
   The report said Washington's policy of allowing corporations to
self police their technology sales, a significant initiative of the
first Clinton administration, has not worked because ``protecting
the national security interest simply may not be related to
improving a corporation's bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   On the subject of aid by U.S. satellite manufacturers for
Chinese scientists the committee found that in 1993, 1995 and 1996
the companies transferred missile design information and know-how
to China without obtaining the legally required licenses. The
information has improved the reliability of China's civilian and
military rockets and is useful for future Chinese ballistic
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   President Reagan first approved the launching of American
commercial satellites on Chinese rockets. The committee found that
his 1988 decision was based on two outdated factors: ``insufficient
domestic launch options in the aftermath of the Challenger
disaster'' and the belief that China ``was a strategic balance
against the Soviet Union in the context of the Cold War.''
</P>
<P>
   The report calls for improving American rocket launching
capabilities, strengthening the monitoring at foreign launch sites
and tightening federal scrutiny of commercial space insurers and
satellite exports.
</P>
<P>
   Buried in the report is a prescient warning. The committee noted
the lack of procedures to detect or prevent the movement of
classified nuclear weapons information to less secure unclassified
computer systems at the weapons laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until last month that the Energy Department, which
owns the labs, took drastic actions to begin to address that issue.
That came days after officials learned that a scientist at Los
Alamos National Laboratory, suspected of spying for China, had
several years earlier downloaded to an unsecure computer system
virtually the entire history of U.S. nuclear weapons testing and
development.

L.A. GROCERY CHECKER `STAR' OF CANCER TESTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ROBERT MONROE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Even world-class cancer researchers have heroes,
and Sue Merriam of suburban Arleta is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   The grocery store checker from the city's San Fernando Valley
northwest of downtown is among 22,000 women who medical centers
began recruiting Tuesday to compare two breast-cancer prevention
drugs, tamoxifen and raloxifene. The study, launched nationwide and
by five local medical research centers, is one of the largest
trials of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   After announcing the start of the study, Dr. Cary Presant,
chairman of the St. Vincent's Medical Center Los Angeles Oncologic
Institute, waded through a crowd of his colleagues to pay his
respects to 58-year-old Merriam.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really are one of the stars,'' he told her. ``People
throughout the United States don't realize these heroes are in
their midst.''
</P>
<P>
   Merriam only smiled in reply but later said that such tests are
the only way women like her ``are going to get some answers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel like you're doing something instead of waiting to be
a victim,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the second time Merriam has taken part in a cancer
study. She and other women at high risk for breast cancer were
asked to take a leap of faith that they would get tamoxifen -- not
a placebo -- in the hopes of determining the drug's value.
</P>
<P>
   But she took what turned out to be sugar pills for six years and
said she didn't care because it was a necessary part of the drug's
testing. She said she did it for her daughter, her daughter-in-law
and every woman who will come after them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's anybody who doesn't want to contribute
something in life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Merriam will get one of the two drugs, thanks in part
to the first test of tamoxifen showing the risk of getting breast
cancer cut in half by the drug. The Study of Tamoxifen and
Raloxifene or STAR trial, will compare its risks and benefits with
the lesser-known raloxifene over the next five years. The latter
drug, approved to treat osteoporosis in 1997, also has been found
to reduce the risk of breast cancer in some women.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers said both increase the risk of uterine cancer and
blood clots, but trial participants are monitored and the results
for cancer trackers could be invaluable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drugs' use for preventing cancer can help us understand
the malignant process,'' said Dr. Patricia Ganz, director of the
Cancer Prevention and Control Research Division at the Jonsson
Cancer Care Center at the University of California, Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Merriam's doctor had found precancerous tumors in her breast
three times before 1992. A surgeon suggested that she take part in
the tamoxifen trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just respect her for stepping out and doing this,'' said
Cathy Tracy, Merriam's daughter. ``I think for her, the fear of the
cancer is greater than the risks involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Merriam figures that despite receiving only a placebo, she
gained knowledge about herself, which she feels has kept her tumor
free since 1992. She's also glad she's had access to Ganz, whom she
couldn't have afforded otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``To walk in and see Dr. Ganz at UCLA is $265 the minute you see
her,'' said Barbara Kahn, the coordinator of the STAR project at
that medical center.

SPORTS COLUMN: WIN OR LOSE, VAN GUNDY IS ON THE HOT SEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What a fine time for pro basketball fans here. The
Knicks, after a five-year wait, are playing for a conference
championship beginning Sunday. The team has taken on a sleek,
fast-moving style of play and the franchise, which has seen dark
days, is enjoying a triumphant moment.
</P>
<P>
   But at a time when the organization, the city and the fans
should be dancing in the aisles, the franchise is ensnarled in a
bizarre drama involving the head coach, the team's top executive,
the players and even the news media. The joy of what the team has
accomplished shares the stage with this never-ending drama, and
it's too bad.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before the Knicks completed an impressive sweep of the
Atlanta Hawks on Monday, the Madison Square Garden crowd, instead
of being gripped by pre-game electricity, was digesting the news
that Garden president Dave Checketts admitted that he had indeed
met with Phil Jackson and that he had lied about it, not simply to
the news media but also to his head coach, Jeff Van Gundy.
</P>
<P>
   Fans reacted a number of ways. For some, the idea of being lied
to by the boss or lying to an employee was not such a big deal. For
others, the idea of Phil Jackson in New York was not revolting. For
many in attendance Monday night, the news seem to demand a
response. In the waning moments of the Knicks' victory, fans began
to chant _ instead of chanting for the team or the players, they
chanted for the coach, in sing-song style: ``Jeff Van GUN-dy, Jeff
Van GUN-dy.''
</P>
<P>
   In their minds the fans were giving Van Gundy the vote of
confidence that Checketts refused to give.
</P>
<P>
   But this Knicks franchise has become so fragmented and so
polarized in this lockout-shortened season, there could easily have
been at least two more groups of fans chanting their support at the
Garden. One group could have chanted ``Ernie GRUN-feld'' to pay
homage to Grunfeld's role in bringing Marcus Camby and and Latrell
Sprewell to the Knicks. Another group, considerably smaller, could
have chanted David CHECK-etts.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been no hue and cry for Van Gundy to stay on as head
coach; rather, there have been pockets of support. The greater
sense is one of wait-and-see curiosity: what direction does the
Garden want to take _ Grunfeld's big-name approach or a more
grass-roots approach to rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy is a fine basketball coach, but there's more to
coaching than staying up all night watching film or diagramming
plays. There's more to it than being loyal, so loyal to your
``guys'' that you nearly let the ship sink. Van Gundy's unearned
good fortune _ and I'm not sure he understands this _is that
Sprewell is an outstanding basketball player, and the versatile
Camby has been gracious in ignoring the coach's early-season
innuendos about his lack of work ethic. Camby has held his tongue
and played outstanding basketball.
</P>
<P>
   In victory after victory, the coach has seemed reluctant to
praise the two players. On Monday he said in response to a question
about Sprewell: ``He helped us win. That's all I care about.''
</P>
<P>
   But Van Gundy also cares about his job, and Sprewell and Camby
have played as crucial a role in helping him keep it as Oakley and
Ewing and Starks played in helping him get it.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy proved he can win in the first round and that he can
beat a Hawks team depleted by injuries in Round 2. Indiana
represents a major challenge for Van Gundy's career. This series
will be his best audition yet.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks have the talent to beat Indiana. But to do so, Van
Gundy will have to deploy personnel and use a wide-open style to a
greater extent than he has to this point. In this series, Sprewell
will not be the automatic genie in the bottle; the Pacers have
their own genie in Jalen Rose.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-11-inch Camby is the wild card. How will Van Gundy
use him? Will he break from rigid substitution patterns? Will he
turn the offensive players completely loose?
</P>
<P>
   For the Knicks, it's all part of a vicious and unfortunate
cycle. Van Gundy is reluctant to praise Sprewell or Camby;
Checketts is reluctant to praise Van Gundy.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone talks about this playoff series and ties it to the
Knicks' future. But this season is not about the future. It's about
the here and now. The wheels are about to fall off this wagon, and
no one is sure who is going to be around to put them back on. The
Knicks are playing for now.
</P>
<P>
   Let's make it clear and simple: if the Knicks win the Eastern
Conference championship _ or lose valiantly in seven games _ Van
Gundy crosses the burning sands. He stays. If the Knicks lose, we
keep our options open. &QL;

 &HT;    Braves notebook: Smoltz encouraged by pitching session
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Milwaukee _ The news couldn't have been much better for John
Smoltz _ and the struggling Braves starting rotation _ Tuesday
after he spent 30 minutes throwing from a mound for the first time
since going on the disabled list May 17.
</P>
<P>
   He threw about 75 pitches in the bullpen at what he estimated
was 80-85 percent and reported afterward he was feeling good and
was still on track to return when he comes off the disabled list to
start either June 1 or 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lot more pleasant than I expected,'' said Smoltz,
whose pain level was his biggest concern. ``That's all I care about
right now. I feel more rusty (than anything).''
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz said he was just glad to be back out there pitching. ``I
couldn't wait any longer. I've been thinking about it for three or
four days. `What am I going to do?' and `How am I going to do
it?'''
</P>
<P>
   Next is another throwing session Friday or Saturday in Atlanta,
and this time he'll face hitters in some sort of simulated game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was just a small hurdle,'' Smoltz said. ``Next thing is
to throw to hitters when they don't know what's coming, more like a
game, refamiliarize myself with the strike zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Nomo's back
</P>
<P>
   The Braves are curious what they'll see tonight when they face
pitcher Hideo Nomo, who has apparently returned to form with the
Brewers after being released by the Mets and Cubs earlier this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo, 1-1 for Milwaukee with a staff-best 2.21 ERA, is 2-0 with
a 1.94 ERA in seven career starts against the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves hit him hard in spring training before he was
released by the Mets. After winning the NL Rookie of the Year award
in 1995, Nomo started to struggle with his control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the league adjusted to him, he started having problems,''
said Chipper Jones, who's 0-for-19 against Nomo. ``You're a little
bit apprehensive because obviously something changed. We'll find
out pretty early what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   At his best, Nomo mixes a fastball and a split-finger fastball,
while hiding the ball in a strange delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Hunter replaced Ryan Klesko in the lineup Tuesday against
Brewers left-hander Jim Abbott. Klesko has not started against a
left-hander since the Padres' Sterling Hitchcock on May 9. Klesko
is hitting .158 (3-for-19) with one home run against left-handers
and .303 (27-for-89) with five home runs against right-handers. . .
. Jones' 455-foot home run off Horatio Estrada Monday night tied
Greg Vaughn and Cecil Fielder for the fourth-longest homer hit at
County Stadium since stadium officials began recording distances in
1987. The homer was the longest the switch-hitter remembers hitting
from the right side and it brought his season total from the right
to five, along with five homers from the left. His career high in
home runs from the right side in a season is six, in 1996.

 HMOs SEEN LIMITING MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT 
 (jw) 
 By RANDY KENNEDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Robert Payton's mother had a premonition that she
would never see her son again when she dropped him off at the ferry
in Weehawken, N.J., that muggy day last summer. ``She turned around
to wave goodbye to him from the car,'' recalled Payton's sister,
Maureen Hussey, ``and she didn't see him. She told me later that it
seemed like an omen to her.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton was 42, a tall, athletic Manhattan lawyer with dark brown
eyes and a fast, bright smile. He had been his family's quick
study: magna cum laude from Boston University, a law degree and
what looked like a promising legal career ahead. But it never took
off, and his family discovered one reason why on a horrible day in
January 1998, with a call from a hospital. He had accidentally
overdosed on a mix of alcohol, cocaine and other drugs _ his
private demons, apparently, for years _ and he lay unconscious for
nearly two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   When Payton finally woke up, he knew he was lucky to be alive,
and he wanted to start fighting his addictions. But first, it
turned out, he had to fight something else: his managed-care
company, Aetna U.S. Health Care, which would not approve his
requests for in-patient drug rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   Eight months later, after dozens of letters and hundreds of
phone calls, he won _ a grievance committee for Aetna recommended
in a Sept. 8 letter that the coverage be approved. But Payton was
not there to get the letter. He had died three weeks earlier, of
another accidental overdose.
</P>
<P>
   Payton's story may be extreme. But his case occupies a new and
active battlegrounds in the national debate over managed care and
patients' right to treatment. To many medical professionals across
the country, particularly in mental health, as well as several
state attorneys general, Payton's case illustrates a growing
problem: managed-care companies hindering access to mental health
and substance abuse services covered in patients' plans.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations _ of administrative tangles, stonewalling and
lack of information _ are akin to those levied by patients and
doctors who deal with managed-care companies on issues of physical
illness. But critics of the managed-care companies say those
problems are magnified when mental illness and substance abuse are
involved because health maintenance organizations consider those
conditions to be a lower priority and more vulnerable to costly,
possibly unnecessary, treatments.
</P>
<P>
   State attorneys general _ who solicited testimony on the issue
last month at a hearing in Chicago _ also contend that managed-care
companies hinder those seeking mental health and drug abuse help
because there is less chance they will resist. Over the last three
years or so, the attorneys general say, they have received
increasing numbers of such complaints from doctors, clinics and
patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're dealing with a population that is especially
vulnerable,'' said Eliot Spitzer, the state attorney general in New
York, whose office has set up a health care bureau to pursue
complaints against managed-care companies. And because of that
vulnerability, he said, ``We believe they think they have a greater
latitude to deny care and escape the sanctions that should be
imposed on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizations that represent the managed-care industry deny any
such intent, and contend _ though the statistics to back it up are
several years old _ that the advent of managed care has made those
services, especially for mental health care, available to a wider
population by helping to bring down prices of visits to
psychologists and stays in clinics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the states' attorneys general are going to make this
assertion, we would certainly like to see how they plan to back it
up,'' said Pamela Greenberg, executive director of the American
Managed Behavioral Healthcare Association, which represents
managed-care companies specializing in mental health and substance
abuse care.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Payton, Joyce Oberdorf, a spokeswoman for Aetna,
said Tuesday that the company still maintained that his individual
policy did not cover what he was seeking. He was finally granted
coverage, she said, because ``a decision was made to make an
exception _ that his case was such that it warranted one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But by then unfortunately his drug problems were such that
this happened,'' she said, ``and it was a tragedy.''

 NEW YORK: a tragedy. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Payton _ whose mother, Dolores, has filed a lawsuit seeking $800
million in damages from Aetna and from two doctors who work there
as medical directors _ was not officially denied the coverage for
in-patient drug rehabilitation, which can cost tens of thousands of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But Aetna did not provide the authorization for the treatment,
and Payton, a lawyer in private practice, was forced to write
letters and make dozens of calls and then to begin a grievance
procedure, all of which his family's lawyer, David Trueman, says he
meticulously documented in a journal. Payton pursued the case with
his typical lawyerly persistence, his family said, even though they
began to suspect that he was using drugs again.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, on June 15, five months after he began seeking help and
after three grievance procedures, he was informed by Aetna that he
had not bought a rider to his individual health plan that would
provide him with a period of in-patient rehabilitation, and so he
was not eligible. Payton later asked the New York attorney
general's office for help, and in August, 10 days before he died,
officials there wrote Aetna that they were ``unable to understand
the basis for your denial.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Payton's contract,'' the letter said, ``plainly covers
in-patient substance abuse rehabilitation.'' A month later, Aetna's
grievance committee sent its letter, saying that ``the committee
has found information to substantiate a change in the company's
position regarding your request,'' though it did not say what that
information was.
</P>
<P>
   One of the exhibits in the suit filed by Payton's mother is a
letter found on the IBM computer in his Chelsea apartment where his
body was found several days after he died. It was dated Aug. 17,
the day authorities believe he overdosed. It was an unfinished
letter, which ended in the middle of a sentence, informing Aetna
officials that he planned to attend his grievance hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could feel near the end that he was getting very
depressed,'' said Ms. Hussey, his sister, who lives in Closter,
N.J., near their mother. ``I would speak to him on the phone, and I
could more or less tell he was using. Or I would visit him in his
apartment, and I knew he needed help.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who accuse managed care of restricting access to mental
health services and drug rehabilitation contend there is a cruel
irony at work that causes the situation to persist. Those who are
in most need of such help _ often people depressed or addicted _
are the ones least likely to venture into the maze of regulations
and grievances to figure out whether they are entitled to it.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, say officials with the New York state attorney
general's office, this causes the percentage of grievances _ red
flags that could indicate problems with access _ to be low. And
this, in turn, has kept it off the front burner as a managed-care
issue.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as Payton's family likes to point out, if there was
anyone who should have been able to negotiate the fine print and
get quick answers from his HMO it would have been a lawyer like
him.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Oberdorf, the spokeswoman for Aetna, said Tuesday that she
could not comment on why it took eight months for Payton's claims
move through the system because those issues are part of the
litigation. The case, in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, alleges
wrongful death, breach of contract and negligence, among other
things, against Aetna, and negligence and medical malpractice
against the doctors. Aetna has filed a motion to have most of those
claims dismissed and to remove the doctors as defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Greenberg, the spokeswoman for the managed-care companies,
said that often in disputes between insurers and patients over
mental health and drug abuse care, difficult decisions must be made
because clients' plans clearly do not include the type of help they
are asking for, even though a doctor may have given them referrals.
``There are many situations where someone cannot get the care,''
she said, ``because it is simply not a covered benefit and that
piece of it is always ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   But she contended that there was evidence to show that so-called
behavioral health-care organizations, which deal with mental health
and substance abuse, make such help more available. While some
national experts say that only 2 percent of the entire population
has recently received mental health care, data from eight large
mental-health managed-care companies in 1993 showed that 5.3
percent of their clients had received this care.
</P>
<P>
   But this stands in sharp contrast to a study commissioned by the
National Association for Psychiatric Health Systems last year. The
study shows that while dollars for general health-care services
provided by employers _ most of them provided through managed care
_ dropped by 7.4 percent from 1988 to 1997, the percentage drop for
mental-health and substance-abuse benefits was 54.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically there's been a huge disparity with coverage of
these kinds of services,'' said Gayle O'Brien, director of legal
and regulatory affairs for the New York State Psychological
Association, ``and with the rise of managed care, it looks like
we're seeing that increase.''

SPREWELL KEEPS APPEARING OUT OF NOWHERE FOR KNICKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the cover of the Knicks' playoff guide is a figure
that looks like a life-sized cardboard cutout from a supermarket
display standing between a stoic Jeff Van Gundy and the
broad-shouldered Chris Dudley.
</P>
<P>
   Latrell Sprewell's image in the team photo is a little flatter
and stiffer than the rest of his teammates. He was late to practice
a month ago, so a computer superimposed a photo of Sprewell into
the space that was left for him.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, what was captured on film April 22 was another
moment in the evolution of the once disjointed Knicks. At his own
speed, Sprewell began to blend into a team that has closed their
gaps, smoothed over their seams and formed a unit at the right time
to face the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   It is a playoff distance never traveled by an eighth-seeded
team, and the first time the Knicks have gone this far since 1994.
Their path has not always been blissful, not even during their
crushing four-game sweep of the Atlanta Hawks.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the day before Game 3 of that series, a shouting
match erupted at practice between two players, according to a
person who requested anonymity. One player was upset over how hard
Van Gundy was pushing them, and the other was trying to stop the
complaining to get through the workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up, 2-0, against Atlanta, and this is what's going on?'' the
person said. ``They almost came to blows.''
</P>
<P>
   Teetering on self-destruction has become a way of life for the
Knicks. They have grown accustomed to their dysfunction and thrived
in spite of it. Through it all, Van Gundy has been able to focus on
the game despite the cloak-and-dagger operations at Madison Square
Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a struggle this year,'' Larry Johnson said. ``We
could have been done and folded in this tent and not focused in on
our goal last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Jeff, he is the toughness one on this team because of
everything that he has to cope with and the criticism he had to put
up with. He not only kept himself together but made sure he kept
his team together and made sure we were prepared every night. I
think his focus was always on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy's vision has not been shared by everyone, but his
strategies have paid off in the playoffs. Sprewell may never
embrace his sixth-man role, but he played it to perfection as he
turned up the pace on the slow dance the Hawks had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Camby may want steadier minutes, but he pounced on each
chance like a cat on yarn and was not shy about challenging Dikembe
Mutombo.
</P>
<P>
   Together, Camby and Sprewell have formed a dynamic second team
that routinely beats the Knicks' first team in practice.
</P>
<P>
   Almost in the shadow of the bench's play, Allan Houston has not
always responded as aggressively as he should, but he has shown he
can coexist with Sprewell and still be a star (34 points in Game
1). Patrick Ewing has groaned a time or two when he has been lifted
from a playoff game, but with his injury situation, Van Gundy's use
of him as a spot-up shooter pulled Mutombo away from the basket.
</P>
<P>
   The injury-plagued Hawks were hardly a good measure for the
Knicks' turnaround. Meet the Pacers. They possess a counter to each
Knick impact player: Jalen Rose, Antonio Davis, Reggie Miller and
Rik Smits.
</P>
<P>
   But Indiana will face a team different from the one that clawed
its way into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything works so much better when we're looking for each
other,'' Camby said. ``When we're swinging the ball around, trying
to get open looks, cutting to the basket, we're at our best.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we had more patience within our team,'' Van Gundy
said. ``We played very well the last three weeks of the regular
season, and we have played well to date in the playoffs. Hopefully,
we can continue.'' &QL;

STRAWBERRY TO BE ARRAIGNED ON DRUG AND PROSTITUTION CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)   (bl)  
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Darryl Strawberry is scheduled to be arraigned on charges of
possession of cocaine and solicitation of prostitution Wednesday
morning in Tampa, Fla., with his immediate baseball future hanging
in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry has maintained he is not guilty and if he pleads that
way, it may be two months before his jury trial begins. If he
pleads guilty or no contest, he almost certainly will prompt Major
League Baseball to suspend him as a multiple offender of its drug
aftercare program.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens Wednesday, however, the calendar
continues to present a formidable threat to Strawberry's baseball
career. After Strawberry, 37, was charged in April, the New York
Yankees ended his workouts at their minor league facility in Tampa,
and he was later placed on administrative leave by Major League
Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Strawberry was allowed to play immediately after his
case was resolved, it could be weeks before he was ready to play
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't given any thought on the Strawberry thing
whatsoever, given the fact that he's out of our control and he's
not under our guidance,'' said Yankees general manager Brian
Cashman. ``If you asked me today who are the left-handed options
for the Yankees in the future, I would say Tony Tarasco and Ricky
Ledee, because Strawberry is not an option right now.''
</P>
<P>
   And there remains the matter of how George Steinbrenner, the
team's principal owner, will react to any resolution other than a
verdict of not guilty. When Strawberry was charged, the Yankees
believed language in his $2.5 million contract gave them the right
to void what is left on his deal. If Strawberry is suspended again
by Major League Baseball, his contract will be voided and he will
be left without a job.

BATTLE GROWS OVER BUDGET AS SPEAKER THREATENS THE GOVERNOR'S PAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Because the state budget is late, legislators
have gone almost two months without pay, and some angry and
frustrated Democrats want to make Gov. George Pataki do without,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver is considering blocking an
emergency spending bill that contains the salaries of the governor
and other statewide elected officials for the next two weeks,
Silver's aides said on Tuesday. If the Assembly does not pass the
spending bill, it could further inflame a budget stalemate that has
already turned bitter and personal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We laid the bill aside, and he's weighing his options and
talking to the members of his conference about how to proceed,''
said Patricia Lynch, a spokeswoman for Silver, D-Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, a Republican, said, ``I would hope that they would just
concentrate on and pass the budget and not look at petty things.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republican officials said it might be illegal to withhold
the officials' pay.
</P>
<P>
   In December, lawmakers approved a 38 percent salary increase for
the state's elected officials, their first increase in 10 years.
But as a condition of approving the raise, Pataki and Joseph Bruno,
the Senate's Republican majority leader, insisted on a law
providing that if the budget was late, pay would be withheld for
the 211 members of the Legislature until the budget was passed.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators received their last paychecks on March 31, the last
day of the old fiscal year. For the 15th year in a row, New York
did not have a budget in place on time.
</P>
<P>
   The government has been kept running through a series of
two-week emergency bills, including one in each cycle providing the
salaries of Pataki, Lt. Gov. Mary Donohue, Comptroller H. Carl
McCall and Attorney General Eliot Spitzer.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed the latest such bill on Monday. The officials
are scheduled to be paid Wednesday, so if the Assembly passed the
bill Wednesday, checks would not be interrupted. But if not, the
Legislature is not scheduled to convene again until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disruptive, it's not helpful, it's not productive,''
Bruno said of Silver's threat. ``We ought to be focused on passing
a budget.''

   Since March, Bruno, Silver and Pataki have traded accusations
over the budget, but there have been few talks and no progress. The
legislative leaders have blamed each other for their failure to
agree on an overall spending cap, and for the fact that conference
committees on the budget have not yet been convened.

GAMBLING PACE UNABATED AT RIVERBOAT CASINOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Kansas City's torrid gambling pace continued
for a second consecutive month in April, as gamblers set a record
for dollars left behind in riverboat casinos.
</P>
<P>
   The $42.8 million record probably won't stand for long, with the
approach of the summer tourist season. In addition, pending changes
in casino regulations later this year would make gambling in
Missouri easier and quicker.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Missouri Gaming Commission, combined April
gambling revenue at the four Kansas City area casinos edged past
the $42.4 million mark set in March. Revenue statewide topped $80
million in April.
</P>
<P>
   Harrah's North Kansas City Casino &AMP; Hotel led all Missouri
casinos with an April tally of $15.4 million, stretching its local
market lead over Station Casino Kansas City to almost 2.5
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Harrah's 1 percentage point increase in market share in April,
to 35.95 percent, came almost entirely at the expense of Station,
which fell back to 33.52 percent. Last fall, Station seized the top
spot for 30 days but couldn't keep up the pace in an expanding
market.
</P>
<P>
   Argosy Riverside Casino in April continued its reign as home of
the market's ``loosest slots.''
</P>
<P>
   Argosy's average jackpot payback rates to players have been
Kansas City's most generous for months in the most popular 5 cent,
25 cent and $1 denomination machines.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Gaming Commission meets today in Maryland
Heights, Mo., to consider abolishing the state's rules on two-hour
cruises and restricted boarding times.
</P>
<P>
   It also is expected to revisit whether to legalize blackjack
card-counting.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, those changes will not go into effect until this
fall, unless the commission acted under its emergency rule-making
procedure, which is not expected.
</P>
<P>
   The commission today also is scheduled to discuss an amendment
to the state's gambling law approved in the waning hours of the
1999 Missouri General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   That three-word change could significantly speed up slot machine
play and, thus, players' average rate of loss.
</P>
<P>
   If signed by the governor, the change will allow players to
receive ``physical or electronic'' tokens when they first buy in to
play. Under current law, when cash is inserted into a slot machine,
the device discharges metal tokens that must be played by hand, one
at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Gambling experts routinely advise slot players to feed coins by
hand to slow down their play, and thus their rate of loss.
</P>
<P>
   Under the change, players' buy-in automatically would be
converted to electronic credits, which are the same as the jackpot
credits paid to players when they win. Electronic wagers can be
made as fast as players can punch the machines' keyboard buttons.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Ryan, executive director of the Missouri Riverboat Gaming
Association, disputes the notion that electronic tokens will hasten
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's strictly a customer-convenience factor as far as we're
concerned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said the open-boarding issue was more acute in St. Louis.
Illinois lawmakers this week are taking steps toward abolishing
river-cruising requirements for floating casinos in that state,
including two on the Mississippi River near St. Louis. The change
would result in open boarding on the Illinois boats.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Taylor, executive director of the Missouri anti-gambling
group Casino Watch, said his organization had taken no position on
electronic tokens but had urged the commission to allow the General
Assembly next year to debate the open-boarding issue.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor suggested that lawmakers next year might challenge any
easing of boarding times allowed by the commission.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Mel Carnahan has until July 14 to sign or veto the gambling
bill.
</P>
<P>
   That legislation, House Bill 793, also:
</P>
<P>
   Stiffens penalties for underage gambling, including misdemeanor
convictions for those under 21.
</P>
<P>
   Extends riverboat gambling licenses from two to three years
between renewal hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Establishes regulatory guidelines for sweepstakes and raffle
gambling legalized by voters last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Clarifies that arcade games and other amusement devices that
award points and prizes valued under $250 shall not be regarded as
gambling.  &LR; brk:Open boarding  &LR; tx:The commission heard testimony in
Kansas City and St. Louis last month from casino executives,
security officers, players and others urging that gamblers be
permitted to enter casinos at any time. Only a handful opposed the
change.
</P>
<P>
   Most said open boarding would be more convenient to players and
make it easier for casino workers to check for underage, inebriated
or compulsive gamblers.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor and others argued that the change represented one more
step in a continuing campaign by casino operators to remove
restrictions placed on the industry when voters approved riverboat
gambling in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic scanner cards, already in use statewide, would
continue to monitor adherence to the state's $500 loss-limit rule.
 &LR; brk:Counting cards  &LR; tx:Blackjack card-counters have sought for
three years to legally ply their trade in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Casino operators routinely bar known or suspected card-counters
from their tables, saying their systems for mentally keeping tabs
of high and low cards played gives them an unfair advantage. Kansas
Citian Robert Cherry filed a formal objection to the practice in
1996 after he was barred from the tables at Harrah's North Kansas
City Casino &AMP; Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The commission late in 1997 voted 2-1 to legalize counting, but
three votes were needed for passage. Two commissioners were absent
that day, and the window for making rules closed shortly
thereafter.

GORE PREACHES VALUES _ AND ASHCROFT'S FOE CRINGES DURING SERMON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore certainly hoped that the
speech he gave Monday about values would boost his presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever good he did for himself, he also tossed a political
bouquet to Missouri's Sen. John Ashcroft, who faces a battle for
re-election against a Gore ally, Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the Salvation Army in Atlanta, the vice president
trumpeted the use of faith-based groups to help the government
solve social problems.
</P>
<P>
   He endorsed a ``little-known provision'' in the 1996
welfare-reform law signed by President Clinton, known as
``charitable choice.''
</P>
<P>
   The provision allows religious organizations to use government
money to provide social services as long as they do not proselytize
and a secular alternative is available. Many see that as a
violating the separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether they are religious or not, most Americans are hungry
for a deeper connection between politics and moral values; many
would say `spiritual values,' '' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   The author of charitable choice, however, was Ashcroft, a
Republican. And he was quick Tuesday to seize the political
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the ``growing bipartisan support,'' Ashcroft proposed
legislation that would extend charitable choice to federally funded
social services across the board.
</P>
<P>
   The political fallout from Gore's speech for Carnahan, however,
may not be so inviting. Gore's blessing of a major Ashcroft
initiative could muddy the governor's ability to continue to paint
the senator as too conservative for Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's having the mantle of the vice president and a Democratic
administration given to John Ashcroft in what promises to be a very
difficult and tough re-election effort,'' said Ralph Reed, a
Republican strategist and occasional Ashcroft adviser.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're certainly not doing any favors for Governor Carnahan
by doing this, or at least by not giving him an opportunity to
share in it, or maybe get ahead of it a little.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy Temple, a political adviser to Carnahan, downplayed the
significance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not necessarily shocked,'' he said. ``Of all the ideas
Ashcroft has proposed, he had one good idea from Gore's
perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Temple added, however, that it would have been nice to have been
warned. he said.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan's office apparently called the White House on Tuesday
to discuss the vice president's speech. And the Gore campaign tried
to point up the differences it had with Ashcroft, one of the early
critics of the president in the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Inside political circles, the view among both Democrats and
Republicans was that the Gore campaign, which had been preparing
the values speech for several weeks, had slipped up by not giving
Carnahan an early warning.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the governor's record as a strong, longtime supporter of
the Clinton administration, Missouri is often a key battleground
state in presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
   The episode adds to the impression that the Gore campaign, which
has been traveling a much smoother road lately after a rocky patch,
is still not yet a finely tuned political machine. But it also
foreshadows the kind of tensions in the Democratic Party that lie
in wait when the 2000 campaign is fully engaged.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats still resent the Clinton White House for
embracing welfare reform and a balanced budget before the 1996
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   While no Democrat would publicly express that view, Reed, who is
advising Texas Gov. George W. Bush's GOP presidential campaign,
summed it up when he said: ``It's the prototypical Clinton-Gore
tactic _ whatever they have to do to advance their message without
regard to how it might impact the rest of the party.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's speech to the Salvation Army was an attempt to take the
lead in the political debate over violence and culture. Amid the
national soul-searching after two recent high school shootings,
presidential hopefuls are all trying to give voice to the public
mood.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, a Baptist who spent a year in divinity school, has been
outspoken since the murders of 14 students in Littleton, Colo., on
stricter access to guns, the need for more character education and
parental involvement. But the Atlanta speech, in which he talked
about his own religious convictions, was an attempt to weave the
threads of faith, family and government into a common strand.
</P>
<P>
   By saying, ``our severest challenges are spiritual, not
material,'' Gore waded into uncharted territory as far as Democrats
are concerned. Religion and politics has long been a province
inhabited largely by Republicans. Democrats stayed away because any
discussion of ``values'' evoked connections to the religious right
wing.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Littleton, however, values and their place in
society are emerging as a political issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Gore has done is try and say values are critical to him
personally,'' said Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster and Gore
adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said Gore's support of faith-based programs is not new. He
dealt with them in 1997 when he worked with welfare-to-work groups.
Other presidential contenders, including Democrat Bill Bradley and
Bush embrace them, also.
</P>
<P>
   And now the issue of religion's role in social policy could be
felt in the Missouri Senate contest, which, apart from a possible
race in New York by first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, is
considered one of the hottest in the country. As for Ashcroft's
reaction to Gore's speech?
</P>
<P>
   Said spokesman Steve Hilton: ``He was just delighted.''

TWO GUNS AT JESSE JAMES MUSEUM TOO NEW TO HAVE BEEN OUTLAW'S 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY BERRIOS  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ There's been a goof involving America's most
famous gunslinger.
</P>
<P>
   Two guns that have been touted by the Jesse James Farm and
Museum for 11 years as the legendary outlaw's weapons _ including a
Colt .45 revolver James was supposedly wore right before he was
killed _ are not the real things.
</P>
<P>
   The two guns actually were made /{after/} James was shot in the
back of the head by Robert Ford in St. Joseph in 1882.
</P>
<P>
   The archival error was discovered after a tourist from England
asked an innocuous question about the rifle. That question prompted
Elizabeth Gilliam Beckett, the director of the Kearney museum, to
review acquisition records.
</P>
<P>
   She noticed the revolver and the Winchester rifle, which the
museum /{thought/} James used in a train robbery, did not have
authenticity documents.
</P>
<P>
   Using serial numbers to research the guns' lineage, Gilliam
Beckett discovered the revolver was made in 1883 and the rifle was
made in 1890.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked and surprised,'' she said Tuesday. ``The public
needed to know these weren't Jesse's guns.''
</P>
<P>
   The two guns were donated to the museum in 1988 by Ethel Rose
Owens, a deceased granddaughter of James, and James R. Ross, James'
great-grandson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am utterly mystified,'' Ross said Tuesday. Ross said he
remembers James' son, Jesse Jr., shooting the weapons and reveling
about their heritage.
</P>
<P>
   John Hartman, Clay County's director of parks, recreation and
historic sites, said an archival search should have been done when
the guns were donated. But, he added, it's not unusual for a museum
to accept items on good faith based on oral history.
</P>
<P>
   Gilliam Beckett said according to the James family history, both
guns were used in ``Under the Black Flag,'' a 1921 film about a
James robbery that starred Jesse Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Ross said he thinks the only time the guns were out of the
family's possession was during that filming.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether he thought the guns might have been switched,
Ross said, ``I don't know of any other explanation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartman said the museum is researching other artifacts. So far,
no other discrepancies have been found.
</P>
<P>
   There are five weapons at the museum, including the revolver and
rifle, which have remained on display.
</P>
<P>
   Gilliam Beckett said two guns belonged to the James gang.
</P>
<P>
   The only gun the museum now believes was Jesse James' is a
shotgun, made by a London company that was in business between 1876
and 1879, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gilliam Beckett said most guns used by Jesse James are now owned
by collectors. The museum does not buy its artifacts; it relies on
donations.
</P>
<P>
   Hartman said these historical errors are rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a real demonstration of their professionalism
that they caught this one,'' Hartman said. ``You try to be accurate
to the best of your ability.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first time a gun linked to the notorious bank
robber has been questioned.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Jesse James scholars and enthusiasts debated whether a
.44-caliber Smith &AMP; Wesson sold at an auction in England was indeed
the weapon Bob Ford used to murder James.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the ultimate debate over authenticity involved Jesse
James himself.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, a team of scientists conducted DNA testing on remains
exhumed from James' Kearney grave.
</P>
<P>
   Their conclusion? It was Jesse James.

U.S. TO HEAR COMPLAINTS ABOUT POLICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The U.S. Civil Rights Commission on Wednesday will
focus a national spotlight on police practices here by holding a
public hearing on police treatment of minority groups in a city
still reeling from a white officer's admission that he tortured a
black man in a station house restroom.
</P>
<P>
   The panel is preparing to stay late into the night to allow what
it expects might be hundreds of black and Hispanic people to
describe their own encounters with the police, said commission
chairwoman Mary Frances Berry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will stay there as long as there are people who want to be
heard from,'' Ms. Berry said. ``Part of our responsibility is to be
a safety valve for people who have not been heard from.''
</P>
<P>
   The daylong hearing at a Manhattan hotel, at which Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir are also scheduled to
testify, was prompted by the police shooting of Amadou Diallo and
by longstanding complaints that the city's largely white police
force often ignores the civil rights of citizens, especially
members of minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to try to get attention for cases where the police
officers have done things and they get away with it and no one is
held accountable,'' said Iris Baez, who fought until she secured a
federal civil rights conviction against a police officer who killed
her son, Anthony, in 1994. ``I want the commission to take this
very seriously because no one is doing their job,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Commission officials said that in addition to hearing sworn
testimony from witnesses, the panel would review thousands of
police documents for evidence that disproportionate numbers of
black and Hispanic people are searched, and for signs of lapses in
police sensitivity training, discrimination in hiring and promotion
as well as gaps in the current oversight of officers who abuse
their powers.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is a fact-finding, not a prosecuting agency, and
by the fall, Ms. Berry said, it hopes to have prepared a report for
the president and Congress that will include recommendations on how
the New York police might repair their strained relations with
members of minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing, at the Doubletree Guest Suites, on Broadway near
West 47th Street, could not come at a more contentious time. Only
yesterday, Officer Justin A. Volpe pleaded guilty to federal
charges that he violated the civil rights of a Haitian immigrant,
Abner Louima, by sodomizing him with a stick in a station house
restroom. Just weeks ago, four white officers were charged with
second-degree murder in the death of Diallo, an unarmed black man
who was fired upon 41 times.
</P>
<P>
   Those incidents and others have led to investigations of police
conduct by state Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, the City Council
and federal prosecutors in Manhattan and Brooklyn. Giuliani, who is
scheduled to be the lead witness in an hour's appearance, has
argued that so much scrutiny is far out of proportion with what he
describes as isolated problems within the police force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the most restrained Police Department of any in the
United States,'' the mayor said Wednesday, adding nonetheless that
he welcomed the chance to testify. ``This is an opportunity for
both the commissioner and for me to make a much more complete and
full picture, rather than the sometimes abbreviated picture that is
presented.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's position as he approaches his appearance resembles
that of one of his predecessors, Ed Koch, who testified 16 years
ago before a congressional committee investigating possible police
abuses in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Among those also scheduled to testify are the Rev. Al Sharpton;
the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union,
Norman Siegel; the Rev. Calvin Butts, pastor of the Abyssinian
Baptist Church in Harlem, and Public Advocate Mark Green.
</P>
<P>
   Safir will testify late in the morning, in a group with the
chairman of the Civilian Complaint Review Board, the state's
criminal justice coordinator and the president of the Patrolmen's
Benevolent Association. The decision to hear Safir with other
witnesses disappointed police officials, who had hoped to make a
full presentation on the department's enhanced recruiting efforts
and other innovations.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Mode, a police spokeswoman, said: ``Certainly the
commissioner would have preferred to spend more time and would have
preferred to have an opportunity to discuss what we at the Police
Department have been doing, and to do it one on one with the
commission. But he understands their time constraints.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Berry said she had been surprised by how much jockeying for
exposure there had been. ``Usually people will argue that they
can't be on at a time because they have other things to do,'' she
said, ``not because they are worried about what kind of stage they
are going to be on.'' She warned that witnesses should not try ``to
make speeches about how great they are,'' adding, ``We will bring
them up short if anyone tries to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the general public are to begin testifying at 6 p.m.
after the officials have left the hearing, which will be held in
the hotel's sixth-floor ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   The scope of the commission's inquiry in New York is evident in
the broad nature of its subpoenas, which have requested hiring
statistics, training materials and all disciplinary proceedings,
complaints of abuse and discrimination, and civil suits filed
against officers since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-member commission, an independent, bipartisan panel
established by the Civil Rights Act of 1957, voted 3-2 in March to
investigate the police practices in New York. Earlier this month,
the commission released its review of police operations in Los
Angeles, where it began a long-term review in 1993, two years after
the police beating of Rodney King.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Berry said the commission would likely study a second city,
possibly Washington, where there is considerable concern about the
frequency of police gunfire. She also said the panel had hoped
that, by scheduling its New York hearing in the late spring well
after the Diallo shooting, the controversy over police conduct
might have died down a bit. ``But I guess not,'' she said.

SCHOOL'S GRADUATION DRESS CODE CHAFES SOME PARENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATT STEARNS and DONALD BRADLEY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Kevin Cerveny looked pretty spiffy. Just not
spiffy enough to get into his big sister Patricia's graduation from
Raytown High School on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Cerveny's short-sleeve plaid dress shirt, pressed and pleated
navy-blue shorts and brown bucks didn't meet the newly imposed
graduation dress code in the Raytown School District.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what he wears to school,'' said his exasperated mother,
Geralyn Cerveny. ``He's 12 years old. He looks fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, clearly printed on the back of the graduation ticket were
the rules. Among them, no shorts. So Cerveny was hustled home
before the ceremony to put on some pants. About 10 others found
themselves in the same predicament.
</P>
<P>
   District officials said the dress code was not meant to torture
12-year-olds. They wanted to restore some decorum to graduation
ceremonies, which in recent years had become more rowdy at Raytown
schools and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The code was agreed to months ago by a special graduation
committee of seniors, parents and staff.
</P>
<P>
   Few people at the First Baptist Church of Raytown, where
graduation ceremonies were held Monday and Tuesday night, seemed to
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be a little dignity and honor injected into the
ceremony,'' said Randy Frymire, whose son Nathan was among the 266
graduates Tuesday night. ``If they're not dressed appropriately,
they feel they can act inappropriately.''
</P>
<P>
   Graduating senior Mike Shaw hoped the dress code would curb bad
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``In past years, they've had people bring in beach balls and air
horns,'' he said. ``That's just not showing respect to the people
who are graduating.''
</P>
<P>
   Geralyn Cerveny said she understood respect. But, she said, the
invitation spelled out rules for men and women _ not for kids.
</P>
<P>
   She was especially upset that a couple of toddlers had been
allowed in wearing shorts and sandals while Kevin was turned away.
Cerveny said she would write a letter to district officials
complaining about the code's enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   School district spokeswoman Shirley Wurth conceded that the new
system wasn't perfect, and would be evaluated before next year.
Still, she said those who were turned away Tuesday seemed to
understand and simply went home to change.
</P>
<P>
   That staid response differed mightily from Monday night's drama
during Raytown South High School's graduation ceremony, when an
incident helped ignite public controversy over the new dress code.
</P>
<P>
   A man in blue jeans didn't like being told he couldn't get in
because his outfit didn't fit the rules. He complained. He cursed _
loudly, according to witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Officials escorted him out the door. A handful of other guests
also were turned away because their T-shirts, shorts or athletic
shoes didn't comply. Some returned after changing clothes.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday morning, phones were ringing at the district's
central office when employees arrived at work.
</P>
<P>
   /{How in the world,/} some callers wondered, /{could the
district prevent parents from attending graduation just because of
the clothes they wore?/}
</P>
<P>
   The answer: To cut down on hooting, outbursts and the
aforementioned noisemakers and beach balls.
</P>
<P>
   Other districts have dealt with the issue, too _ just not in the
same manner as Raytown.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, graduations in the Kansas City School District
were marred by raucous crowds and over-zealous family members.
Student speeches and instrumental performances were drowned out,
and one relative of a graduate was even arrested.
</P>
<P>
   So in 1996, the Kansas City district took some steps to make
sure such chaos would never happen again.
</P>
<P>
   To control disruptions, the district opted to hold smaller
ceremonies on school grounds, issued admission tickets to some
celebrations and provided more security.
</P>
<P>
   But the district does not impose a dress code on the family
members and well-wishers of its high school graduates.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators do, however, expect proper decorum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We communicate to the guests that they should act and dress in
a dignified manner that would be respectful of all the graduates,''
said district spokeswoman Roxane Johnson. ``Because they've worked
really hard for this honor and this day.''
</P>
<P>
   Several districts require seniors to wear something nice under
those caps and gowns, but Raytown may be the first to go to a dress
code for those attending the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The Olathe, Shawnee Mission, Lee's Summit, Park Hill, North
Kansas City, Hickman Mills and Kansas City, Kan., districts have no
dress codes for graduation guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's my place to tell adults how to dress,''
said Hickman Mills High School Principal Charles Greene.
</P>
<P>
   At Oak Park High School in the North Kansas City School
District, commencements have a history of seniors bouncing beach
balls through the air during the reading of students' names.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to express to them it's both a celebration and a
ceremony,'' Principal Benny Cain said. ``After all the names are
read, then it's time to celebrate.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as noisy disruptions, Shawnee Mission principals ask
parents before graduation each year to treat the occasion with
dignity, spokesperson Shelley Bartkoski.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a really special ceremony,'' Bartkoski said. ``They want
to make it special for the graduates.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the real purpose behind Raytown's dress code, Watkins
said. When discussing how to calm down graduations, a senior on the
committee said: ``We act better when we dress up.''
</P>
<P>
   The 30-member graduation committee also limited the number of
guests per graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins said three letters had been sent home with graduates
explaining the new rules. The dress code was clearly spelled out on
the ticket to the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you were blind, you knew what was expected,'' said
Sharon Logue, a parent who attended the Raytown South's ceremony
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Kurtenbach, executive director of the American Civil
Liberties Union of Kansas and Western Missouri, thought officials
may have overreacted to those who didn't meet the school district's
dress code.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should have expected that some folks wouldn't abide by
it, and try to make some accommodation,'' he said. ``Their sons and
daughters only graduate once, and to bar them from the ceremony
seems pretty drastic.''
</P>
<P>
   But guests who made a scene at the door objecting to the dress
requirement disturbed Logue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a defiance of rules and they set a very poor
example for our children,'' Logue said.
</P>
<P>
   Logue, a 1966 graduate of Raytown South, remembers another age _
when people dressed up for graduation because it was a special
night and deserved respect.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the years of shorts, tank tops and ball caps. Along
with the casual dress came noise and rowdiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we're trying to get back to where we should have been all
along,'' Logue said.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Schmiedeler, father of a graduate, took an opposing
view.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can that school district dictate what adults should wear
to a public event?'' Schmiedeler asked. ``What if someone can't
afford nice dress clothes?
</P>
<P>
   ``People wait their kid's whole life to go to graduation and I
don't think it's fair to be turned away because of the clothes they
wear.''
</P>
<P>
   Watkins sees the man's point. He points out, though, that these
days blue jeans and other casual clothes often cost more than dress
wear.
</P>
<P>
   He also emphasized that the man escorted from the Raytown South
ceremony wasn't ushered out because of his clothes. The man was
hostile and verbally abusive, Watkins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the way he was dressed. It was the way he acted.''

WOMAN AND 3 CHILDREN ARE KILLED BY AN AMTRAK TRAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAIRFIELD, Conn. _ A woman and three of her four young sons were
killed early Tuesday morning when they were hit by an Amtrak train
as the woman crossed the tracks in a last-second attempt to rescue
one of the children from the locomotive's path, the State Police
said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the boys who was struck survived, but remained
unconscious and was in gravely critical condition at Bridgeport
Hospital Tuesday night after surgery to repair a deep head wound
and several bone fractures, hospital officials said. The boy, whom
police identified as Angel Gabriel Urgiles Toledo, 6, also
underwent emergency surgery to amputate what remained of his left
leg.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday, police investigators were still trying to
determine why the woman, an Ecuadorean immigrant in in her 40s, was
walking with her four sons along a series of four parallel train
tracks about 2:20 a.m. The woman and the boys, ages 3, 6, 10 and
12, had been living for the past week at Families-In-Transition, an
emergency shelter operated by the YMCA in Bridgeport, police said.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Chief James O'Donnell of the Connecticut
State Police said investigators would not be able to identify the
victims until the bodies are examined by state's medical rxaminer's
office.
</P>
<P>
   The woman's husband, identified by the Ecuadorean Consulate in
New York City as Carlos Urgiles, had returned to Ecuador more than
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell offered a rough explanation of how the woman and her
four sons were struck by the electrically powered train, an Amtrak
Twilight Shoreliner carrying 210 people between Boston and Newport
News, Va.
</P>
<P>
   He said the woman and three of her four sons were walking on one
side of Track 3, the northernmost of the four tracks just west of
Fairfield's rail station. A fourth boy was apparently walking on
the other side of Track 3, the police said, when the train
approached and the locomotive's engineer pulled on the horn and
engaged the emergency brake.
</P>
<P>
   According to police interviews with the engineer, a 20-year
veteran operator for Amtrak and Conrail, the woman heard the
train's horn and, her three other children in tow, tried to run
over Track 3 to retrieve her fourth child. The child ran toward her
onto Track 3. The train struck all five family members as they
huddled on the track, O'Donnell said.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak officials did not know how fast the train was moving at
the time of the crash, but said locomotives are allowed a top speed
of 70 miles per hour. At that speed, a train takes from one to two
miles to grind to a halt, even with the emergency brake employed.
``There was nothing, absolutely nothing, the engineer could have
done,'' said Kenneth J. Gambardella, an investigator with the
Connecticut Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   The engineer was so distraught after the accident that
paramedics took him to Bridgeport Hospital, along with the train's
conductor, to be treated for shock. Both men were later released,
police said.  &QL;

FAMILY OF WRESTLER KILLED IN FALL CRITICIZES STUNT ORGANIZERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RUTH E. IGOE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Days after their youngest son plunged to his
death in Kemper Arena, Canada's first family of professional
wrestling assailed a sport they think is relying on
ever-more-dangerous stunts for increased TV ratings and revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Family members said what was once a small-time regional show
circuit has become dominated by two national organizations, the
World Wrestling Federation and World Championship Wrestling, which
emphasize over-the-top theatrics that put wrestlers at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a campaign to out-do each other,'' said Smith Hart,
50, said Tuesday from the family home in Calgary, Alberta. ``There
is no respect for the sport anymore. There used to be (wrestling)
heroes for children. I don't see any heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   During a Sunday WWF show dubbed ``Over the Edge,'' Hart's
brother, Owen Hart, fell from a 90-foot-high catwalk preparing for
a aerial descent into the ring.
</P>
<P>
   All seven Hart boys followed their father Stu, a former Olympic
wrestler, into the sport as amateurs and professionals. Owen Hart,
34, was the youngest member of the prominent family. On Sunday,
Owen Hart _ a WWF wrestler known as the ``Blue Blazer'' _ bled to
death internally from blunt chest trauma after he plunged into the
ring.
</P>
<P>
   His brother Bret Hart is a star known as ``The Hitman'' on the
rival World Championship Wrestling circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from both the WWF and the WCW declined to respond to
the family's criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Stu Hart, 84, who promoted the sport for years after his own
wrestling career ended, also thinks his son was exposed to
unnecessary risks. He said his youngest son had harbored doubts
about being lowered by a cable into the ring during Sunday's show.
But, Stu Hart said, someone persuaded him to do it, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put you into compromising positions where they let you
know you have no choice,'' he said. ``They should make sure
everything is safe and that they have good equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, WWF President Vince McMahon has been quoted as
saying that federation wrestlers would stop performing the aerial
move that killed Owen Hart. But on Tuesday, WWF Publicity Vice
President Jim Byrne said he was not sure exactly which stunts would
be prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's being evaluated right now,'' he said. McMahon was
unavailable for further comment.
</P>
<P>
   At World Championship Wrestling, a team of professional stunt
coordinators carefully choreographs each move, said spokesman Alan
Sharp. An aerial descent, like the one Owen Hart was attempting
Sunday, is the signature entrance for a WCW wrestler dubbed
``Sting.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City police are investigating what might have gone wrong
Sunday night. A leading theory, police have said, is that Owen Hart
lost his balance while preparing for his drop and somehow activated
a quick-release that detached his harness from the cable. Police
plan to perform strength testing on the equipment he was wearing,
said Capt. Jerry Gallagher.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
also are investigating whether they might have jurisdiction in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   It is only in recent years, the Harts said, that professional
wrestling has grown into the often-outlandish sport that it is
today.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, most everyone had a background in either
wrestling or other sports, Smith Hart said. Today, he said, that
isn't always the case.
</P>
<P>
   WWF and WCW ``are starting to train some of their own guys
now,'' Smith Hart said. ``There is a lot lacking there. They are
not very good wrestlers. They do more crazy things and there are
more injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith Hart remembers when professional wrestling was more like
old silent movies: melodramatic expressions, wide-sweeping
movements, creative plots involving heroes and villains. Today, he
said, the outfits are wilder, the plots more violent, the
characters brasher.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's far-fetched, ludicrous storytelling,'' he said. ``I don't
watch it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, there are now some Kansas Citians who have abandoned
the sport after Sunday's incident. Kevin Brice of Blue Springs used
to watch what he thought were ``lighthearted'' shows with his
10-year-old daughter, Kelly. But after attending Sunday's WWF
event, which continued after Owen Hart was taken from the ring,
Brice has vowed never to watch professional wresting again.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was human sacrifice,'' he said about Owen Hart's death.
``It turned out to be all about the bucks.''

FORD TO BUILD LUXURY PICKUP AT PLANT IN KANSAS CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Ford Motor Co. today is expected to
announce today that a new ``luxury pickup'' will be built at its
Claycomo plant, marking the third new product planned for the
facility.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Ford planned to unveil the Lincoln Blackwood,
being billed as a hybrid of a luxury sport-utility vehicle and a
pickup truck that could sell for more than $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has scheduled a news conference at the Westin Crown Center
hotel for this afternoon. Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan is expected to
attend.
</P>
<P>
   This would be Ford's third announcement within a year regarding
a new vehicle to be built at Claycomo. The plant employs nearly
5,000 hourly and salaried workers, making it Ford's biggest
factory, in terms of workers, in North America.
</P>
<P>
   Local union officials said several hundred jobs could be added
at Claycomo as a result of the new products.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the changes and new products coming up are definitely good
for us,'' said Jerry Kline, president of United Auto Workers Local
249.
</P>
<P>
   But Ford spokesman Mike Vaughn disputed the jobs claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any net gain (in jobs) would be minimal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the automaker said it would begin building a compact
sport-utility vehicle there to replace the Ford Contour and Mercury
Mystique cars. Production of the SUV is expected to begin next
year. In addition, Ford will add to Claycomo's F-series truck line
the F-150 SuperCrew, a four-door pickup with a bigger back seat.
</P>
<P>
   The Claycomo plant is undergoing extensive renovations and an
expansion that will add at least 122,000 square feet to produce the
sport-utility vehicle. Some construction also is being done to
accommodate the F-150 SuperCrew and apparently the Blackwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blackwood will be built on the same basic platform as the
SuperCrew,'' said Michael Robinet, director of forecast services
for CSM Worldwide, an automotive consulting firm in Farmington
Hills, Mich. ``So we think it'll be built in Kansas City.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford unveiled a concept Blackwood in December at the Los Angeles
International Auto Show. The four-door, four-passenger vehicle is
based on the design of the Lincoln Navigator luxury sport-utility
vehicle but adds an enclosed, wood-paneled box similar to a truck
bed.
</P>
<P>
   The truck would come only in black. The exterior trunk area
would be covered with more than 20 square feet of wood sealed in a
clear epoxy, recalling the ``woody'' look of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The hard top of the enclosed trunk would open hydraulically to a
45-degree angle, exposing an aluminum-finished interior. A global
positioning system is integrated into the center console. The four
bucket seats will be trimmed in leather.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be the ultimate luxury pickup available on the market,''
Robinet said. He expects the Blackwood to sell for more than
$40,000.
</P>
<P>
   Wes Brown, an analyst with Nextrend, a marketing research firm
in Thousand Oaks, Calif., estimates that Ford's Lincoln Mercury
division will sell about 5,500 Blackwoods in 2000 and as many as
8,500 in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's Vaughn declined to comment on speculation about today's
product announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Reports last year indicated that Ford was spending up to $750
million on construction at Claycomo in preparation for the new
vehicles. A state enterprise zone was expanded to extend a variety
of tax incentives for the project.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials said more construction could keep the plant
closed longer than the traditional two weeks this summer for model
changeovers.

 &HT;    Reds down Dodgers 3-2
 &HT;    By Marc Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Kevin Brown wore a commemorative Sandy Koufax patch
on the left sleeve of his Los Angeles Dodgers uniform and pitched
like Koufax most of the game.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't quite good enough, especially since Steve Parris of
the Cincinnati Reds was also pitching like Koufax. And the Dodgers
defense let Brown down.
</P>
<P>
   It all led to a 3-2 Reds' win in front of 18,203 at Cinergy
Field on Tuesday night, extending Cincinnati's winning streak to
three games. The Reds have won eight of their last nine.
</P>
<P>
   None of it could have happened without some faulty Los Angeles
fielding plays, despite the fact Brown struck out a career-high 12.
</P>
<P>
   When Barry Larkin struck out to seemingly end the fourth, he
made it to first on catcher Todd Hundley's passed ball. Hundley
magnified the mistake by throwing the ball away trying to get
Larkin at first. Dmitri Young, who had walked, took third on the
error.
</P>
<P>
   Larkin then stole second without a throw, and would have been
out there had first baseman Eric Karros come up with Michael
Tucker's grounder that sliced under his glove. It was ruled a hit
as two runs scored, giving the Reds a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Thus Brown _ the costliest player in baseball with a 7-year,
$105 million contract that pays him more per game than Parris makes
this season _ trailed despite striking out six, walking one and
allowing only a third-inning double by Larkin prior to Tucker's
hit.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds tacked on another run when Mark Lewis and Eddie
Taubensee led the fifth with back-to-back doubles.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is not used to such abuse, especially against the Reds. He
entered the game 6-0 with a 1.58 ERA against Cincinnati. He was 5-2
with a 2.54 ERA this season, and his ERA was not hurt in this game.
The two runs allowed in the fourth were both unearned.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Parris _ who is playing for $275,000 this season _ was
more than a match for Brown. Although Devon White led off the game
with a single and Gary Sheffield led the fourth with his 10th
homer, Parris made a nearly spotless appearance in only his third
start of the season. He allowed a second hit in the fourth _ a
single _ and another single in the fifth. In the sixth, he walked
Sheffield.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, Parris gave up an infield hit to Adrian Beltre.
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, that was it for the Dodgers, and it for Parris, who
completed seven innings with nine strikeouts and five hits. He
walked just one. Danny Graves came on to start the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Graves was greeted by a Sheffield single, but got Raul Mondesi
and Hundley to fly to center before he caught a line drive to the
mound by Eric Karros.
</P>
<P>
   Graves was not so lucky in the ninth. Beltre was out on a
sensational play by second baseman Pokey Reese, who flagged a
bouncer into the hole and threw to Graves for an out.

NFL PUTS STING ON L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER   
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is a setup, a sting worthy of Redford and Newman, a superb
example of the long con. The NFL is starring in a remake of ``The
Grifters,'' and Los Angeles is its mark.
</P>
<P>
   League owners are meeting in Atlanta and receiving an update on
stadium designs and business plans from the two groups seeking an
expansion franchise in Los Angeles, Michael Ovitz and the Eli
Broad/Ed Roski team.
</P>
<P>
   Befitting his background in entertainment, Ovitz arranged a
sneak preview of his Coliseum vision for several owners before the
meetings began, and it elicited more ohhs and ahhs than the new
Star Wars film. Carolina owner Jerry Richardson, head of the
expansion committee, called it ``extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   Other words also apply.
</P>
<P>
   What the NFL ostensibly is doing is putting Los Angeles and its
political leaders against the wall in search of the league's
favorite kind of money, public money.
</P>
<P>
   If the league leaves Atlanta with a mandate or leaning in favor
of the Ovitz plan, and every indication is it will, state and city
officials will have to deal with a plan that calls for $225 million
in public money to build several parking garages in Exposition
Park.
</P>
<P>
   This is a classic scam. For three years, L.A. City Councilman
Mark Ridley-Thomas and Kings owner Ed Roski carried the Coliseum's
flag and worked diligently on a proposal that could bring football
back to L.A. at a reasonable cost. Roski and Broad were prepared to
pay for most everything, with a minimal $40 million public
investment of new money via the sale of bonds.
</P>
<P>
   But after signing off on the Coliseum, seemingly giving the
councilman his victory, the NFL retained the right to select a
developer and owner rather than accept the Roski/Broad proposal
that had hard financial commitments with government.
</P>
<P>
   That day, Ovitz was asked when he would meet with city and state
officials about his Coliseum plans. ``That's a good question,'' he
said. ``I haven't really thought about it yet.''
</P>
<P>
   He still hasn't. There hasn't been any discussion, much less an
agreement, between Ovitz and any of the groups involved. They
include: the Coliseum Commission, which has a lease for the stadium
through 2005; the state, which owns the land; civic groups involved
in the overall downtown makeover; several conservancies, including
one that protects the Coliseum; the federal Department of the
Interior; the museums in Exposition Park; and USC.
</P>
<P>
   One presumes this is the way the NFL wanted it. Richardson,
talking about the Ovitz proposal earlier this week, said he expects
L.A. to make whatever adjustments it needs to consider Ovitz's
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``My assumption is they will be given a fair hearing to whatever
the ruling bodies are, particularly if it enhances that park in a
significant way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So clearly, if the deal falls apart, it will do so on the head
of civic leaders who couldn't make it work to the league's
satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly won't fall on the league, which can say it gave
L.A. a conditional franchise and six months to make it happen. The
league can point to other cities and their investments in new
stadia Pittsburgh ($147 million), Cleveland ($166 million), Detroit
($180 million), Nashville ($292 million), Seattle ($300 million),
Cincinnati ($404 million) and say L.A. is getting off cheap for
parking garages that will also benefit its museums.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly won't fall on owner Ovitz, who came up with a
genius stadium and park vision and has, since the beginning, said
``I will do whatever they want.'' This is especially so considering
the league has asked Broad to join Ovitz's team.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine how Mayor Richard Riordan, councilman Ridley-Thomas and
governor Gray Davis will look if they can't strike a deal. Ovitz's
plan, planted in the downtown newspaper Sunday before anyone in
City Hall or Sacramento could respond, incorporates the park way
beyond the mere renovation of a football stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the masses understand the finances, Riordan, Davis and
company will be left a somewhat empty and dreary park, and
remembered as the latest L.A. team to fumble away the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Ridley-Thomas listened to these scenarios calmly and tried to
pick it apart. He said it ``wouldn't be very smart'' for the league
to pick the Ovitz plan and then tell L.A. to make it work. To be
blunt, he said ``They can forget that.''
</P>
<P>
   To date, said Ridley-Thomas, they have met every request by the
league. When the league asked for a new stadium design, they
produced one. When it said Roski needed a partner, Broad showed up.
Per the league's request, its most recent business plan has four
different parking solutions, although none of them as
all-encompassing as Ovitz's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of parking sports just popped up on us,'' said
Ridley-Thomas. ``Every time we satisfy one request, another pops
up. But our track record has been that we keep satisfying (their
requests).''
</P>
<P>
   That said, Ridley-Thomas tried to speak reasonably and
positively about being able to make things work should Ovitz's plan
get the bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to know what this request is, not having seen
it,'' said the councilman. ``It's hard to be supportive when you
don't know what it entails. And the clock is ticking. It's pretty
late for us to be talking about things like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there are a number of funding sources that could be found.
We first have to see how it would benefit (the area). We (meaning
all of the agencies) would be looking for some revenue streams.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, so might Ovitz and the NFL.

EDITORIAL: A BLUE WALL OF WITNESSES 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is too soon to suggest that the Abner Louima case has finally
brought down the ``blue wall of silence'' that has long prevented
New York City police officers from testifying against their
colleagues. But a crack of potentially seismic proportions began to
open when the sickening testimony of a series of his colleagues
forced Officer Justin Volpe to plead guilty on Tuesday to charges
that he tortured Louima two years ago in a Brooklyn police station
bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   The police witnesses, whose appearance clearly surprised defense
attorneys, pointed to Volpe as the one who had sodomized Louima in
August 1997 with a stick and then bragged about it to colleagues.
In court on Tuesday Volpe admitted the attack and said he had also
threatened to kill Louima if he told anybody about it. After Louima
was hospitalized for a torn rectum, a nurse persisted in demanding
answers about his unusual injuries. As the Louima case became
public, it forced New Yorkers to demand answers about how anyone
charged with protecting the public could commit such a sadistic
act.
</P>
<P>
   The police witnesses emerged more slowly than necessary, and
there are those who suggest that they were talking only because
they were afraid of being implicated themselves in this
high-profile case. But those officers who testified deserve credit
for speaking out in court. Once back in the station house, they
will undoubtedly encounter colleagues from the old school who will
label them unfairly as ``rats'' or persecute them in other
unsanctioned ways.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first officers to talk to investigators, Eric
Turetzky, found himself quickly transferred from the 70th Precinct
in Brooklyn, where the incident took place, to the Internal Affairs
Division, which investigates police misconduct. Joseph Armao, chief
counsel to the Mollen commission that investigated police
corruption in the early 1990s, said this transfer signaled to the
police force that Turetzky was no longer fit for any duty except
investigating his colleagues. ``You have to spread the culture of
integrity throughout the department,'' Armao correctly pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   Some have raised the hope that with better-educated officers,
New York's Police Department is not the closed society it once was.
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir prefer
the idea that the blue wall of silence is a media-driven myth that
the Volpe plea has destroyed. But Volpe's attack did not trigger
the usual closing of ranks from fellow officers because it was so
barbaric. The real test of whether the blue wall is finally
breached must await less dramatic cases of corruption or police
abuse.

FEAR AND LOATHING ARE LITERAL ON SOUTH AFRICA'S CAMPAIGN TRAIL

<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ The campaign procession for
President Nelson Mandela's African National Congress began in the
rural town of Nongoma on Friday with an armored vehicle leading the
convoy and ended with a truckload of soldiers in bulletproof vests.
</P>
<P>
   As it wove through the streets, women smacked their thighs and
thrust their buttocks at it insultingly. Men walked through crowds
slapping stickers for the rival Inkatha Freedom Party on people's
chests without even asking permission.
</P>
<P>
   From the back of a pickup truck festooned with ANC posters,
Senzo Mchunu spoke to the crowds over a megaphone. He did not tout
the party's accomplishments. He merely assured voters that they
could vote for the party on June 2. Their ballot would really be
secret. They would be safe, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he himself was surrounded by bodyguards _ their Uzis just
visible under their jackets, the bright sun glinting off their dark
glasses.
</P>
<P>
   In some parts of South Africa, political freedom is still more
of an ideal than a reality. As the country nears its second
post-apartheid national elections, there is far less tension than
there was in 1994, when thousands died in bloody clashes.
</P>
<P>
   But political violence and intimidation are not gone. Nowhere
was that clearer than in Nongoma last week. For the first time, the
African National Congress took its campaign to this Inkatha Freedom
Party stronghold deep in the heart of the lush province of
KwaZulu/Natal on the country's east coast. It was eventually forced
to leave in a hurry by a fierce mob shouting abuse and stomping out
the rhythmic war dance of a Zulu battalion.
</P>
<P>
   In April two ANC organizers were killed in this town _ one in
broad daylight on a crowded street, though no witnesses have come
forward. Within hours of the campaigning on Friday, the party's
posters had been ripped down and the house of another supporter, a
Zulu prince, had been firebombed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, party officials called the excursion a success. In 1994
they would not have dared to come at all. ``We achieved the purpose
we came for,'' boasted Mchunu, the party's deputy secretary in the
region, once he was safely out of town. ``The ANC made clear they
were going to fight to take their campaign everywhere, even
Nongoma.''
</P>
<P>
   Some South Africans will experience this year's elections as
voters in any Western country would. They will go to meetings,
listen to radio ads (television ones are banned), talk to friends
and make up their minds. But for many others _ particularly in
rural areas and in the squatter camps in black townships _
violence, intimidation and a lack of information will hobble their
freedom of choice.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the long-standing conflict between the governing
African National Congress and the Inkatha Freedom Party, there has
been tension between the governing party and the upstart biracial
United Democratic Party, led by a former ANC official, Bantu
Holomisa.
</P>
<P>
   That has been especially true in the Cape Town area and the
Eastern Cape, where even a rally featuring Mandela was disrupted by
United Democratic Party supporters in April.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights organizations say that officials from both parties
have been shot at near Cape Town while putting up election posters,
and that there has been a resurgence of paramilitary training.
There have been deaths as well, including four in March within 48
hours that appeared to be tit-for-tat killings of officials of both
parties.
</P>
<P>
   In the same areas, gang violence _ and Muslim vigilante groups
crusading against it _ may also be factor in the elections. A
conservative Muslim group has called on its followers to boycott
the voting because no party deserves its support. That could make
it hard for some Muslims to go to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Then, over the weekend, the seven Muslim members of the
country's election commission from the Cape area resigned, saying
they had been threatened with death if they continued their work.
</P>
<P>
   But it is KwaZulu/Natal _ where the ANC and the Zulu-based
Inkatha party have clashed for years _ that still appears to be the
most volatile. Peace negotiations have been under way since 1997,
and rumor has it that the ANC, which is expected to win the
elections in a landslide, will give Inkatha a place in its
government when the elections are over.
</P>
<P>
   Yet suspicions abound between the two groups, and local
officials are not necessarily as enamored of peace as their
national leaders. The police uncovered a seven-ton arms cache
belonging to Inkatha two weeks ago, but said it hardly made a dent
in the arsenals believed to be kept by both sides. Most experts say
an explosion of violence is still possible.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, killings are down. The human rights groups say at
least 120 people have died in political violence in the last few
months, compared with more than 300 in 1994.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some say the number of bodies may not reflect the true level of
fear. Even without hundreds of deaths, the voting population can be
intimidated. ``You can maintain pressure without stepping up the
violence,'' said Mary de Haas, a social anthropologist at the
University of Natal who publishes a newsletter on political
violence. ``A killing here and a killing there, and it sends a
message that most people will listen to. Just an odd death or two
is enough to get anybody scared.''
</P>
<P>
   In some villages, Ms. de Haas said, people sleep in the grass at
night for fear of being attacked in their homes. Many will vote
exactly as their local chiefs tell them to. In fact, privacy in the
voting booth becomes something of a joke in the rural areas, where
illiteracy is high and many people rely on others to show them
where to make their mark.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Inkatha campaigners have felt their share of
intimidation as well. When Inkatha's leader, Chief Mangosuthu
Buthelezi, tried to hold a rally in the governing party's territory
along KwaZulu's south coast last week, he met up with its
supporters, who shouted abuse and padlocked the stadium to keep out
his luxury campaign bus.
</P>
<P>
   Around Durban, KwaZulu's largest city, there have also been
several incidents of violence during the campaign, including the
shooting of an African National Congress organizer in the Umlazi
district last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   At his funeral on Sunday, the police had to rescue an Inkatha
supporter who was being beaten by a mob.
</P>
<P>
   But the oratory between the longtime enemies is not nearly as
heated as it was in 1994. Buthelezi, 71 and suffering from
diabetes, has been wooed by the ANC over the last five years _ and
allowed to be ating resident when Mandela and his heir apparent,
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, were both out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Buthelezi is coy about whether he will accept a role in a
coalition government, but it is clear that he is not campaigning
with the ardor of 1994. At a recent rally near Johannesburg, he
even included a cheer for Mandela and the ANC And the two parties
signed a pact saying they would allow each other to campaign freely
throughout the province.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the arms cache has raised tensions, and Buthelezi and
Mbeki backed out of a joint appearance at a prayer meeting
scheduled for last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday, a kind of history was made when the ANC went
campaigning without incident in Lindelani township, a former ``no
go'' area. Pius Mkhize, 24, accepted a flier but tucked it quickly
into his jacket.
</P>
<P>
   He said he could take the flier only because he did not actually
live in Lindelani. He was visiting his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, if they catch you with this, they shoot you,'' he said.
``It is very dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   But David Shabalala, the township's fierce self-proclaimed
Inkatha ``warlord,'' was certainly not in a fighting mood. At one
point he surprised the campaigners by arriving in their midst. From
the trunk of his car, he pulled out handfuls of his own party's
fliers and threw them in the air in what appeared to be friendly
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Shabalala said he would be campaigning in ANC territory soon.
``They can come here,'' he said of the governing party's workers.
``But I will beat them on election day.''

A TURF BATTLE OVER HANDLING OF FRAUD CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A purloined prisoner in an important state securities
fraud case has put two powerful prosecutors on a collision course.
</P>
<P>
   At one end of the tarmac is Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan
district attorney, and at the other is Zachary W. Carter, the U.S.
attorney in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle sits Victor Wang, the former chairman of Duke &AMP;
Co., a defunct New York brokerage firm. On May 5, Wang, along with
Duke and 17 former colleagues, was indicted for securities fraud by
Morgenthau's office. He was unable to raise the $1.25 million cash
bail set by Justice William Wetzel of State Supreme Court and thus
resided in prison.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, apparently with no notice to Morgenthau, federal
marshals spirited Wang from his cell on Riker's Island at the
request of Carter's office. Michele Adelman, an assistant attorney
in that office, declined to comment on Wang's whereabouts or what
federal prosecutors might be discussing with him.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly upset over the twist in a case that reflects nearly two
years of work by his office, Morgenthau said, ``We were surprised
that they would remove from state custody a prisoner under state
indictment for any reason, but particularly without notifying the
district attorney or getting our consent.''
</P>
<P>
   In the indictment of Duke and its employees, Morgenthau said
Wang oversaw the manipulation of six stocks underwritten by Duke
between 1995 and 1998. If found guilty, Wang faces up to 30 years
in state prison.
</P>
<P>
   Now that case could be threatened. Under New York's double
jeopardy law, someone pleading guilty to a federal crime _ and Wang
may be discussing such a prospect with Carter's office _ cannot be
prosecuted for a similar crime by the state.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors are not barred from securing a guilty plea
following a state prosecution, but the Petit Rule says that they
should generally not prosecute where a state prosecution already
exists. To do so, a federal prosecutor usually must get approval
from the Department of Justice. The U.S. attorney declined to
comment on that matter on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Wang's exit from Riker's Island _ under a writ requested by
Carter's office _ may signal that the former broker is trying to
reach a plea agreement with federal prosecutors that would trump
Morgenthau's indictment. In their writ, the federal prosecutors did
not state whether they sought Wang as a witness in a case or as a
defendant.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Wang's lawyer, Lawrence V. Carra of Mineola, N.Y.,
said, ``It is not in my client's best interests to discuss his
transfer.''
</P>
<P>
   If a plea is being discussed, it indicates that cooperation
between the U.S. attorney's and the district attorney's staffs,
which have previously worked together, is near a low. The
maneuvering for control of high-profile cases is usually conducted
by prosecutors behind the scenes, not in the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Jack S. Hoffinger, a criminal defense lawyer at Hoffinger,
Friedland, Dobrish &AMP; Stern, called the apparent squabble
unfortunate. ``It's irregular to writ out a state prisoner without
notifying the district attorney who put him away. Especially when
the DA is Bob Morgenthau, whose competence and integrity are models
for the rest of the country,'' he said. ``Is this a grab for
publicity?''
</P>
<P>
   Since Morgenthau began investigating Duke &AMP; Co. almost two years
ago, four former employees of the firm have pleaded guilty to
securities violations. Earlier this month, a grand jury returned
indictments against the firm and 18 individuals for enterprise
corruption, grand larceny, antitrust violations and evidence
tampering.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors contend that Duke employees colluded with at least
two other brokerage firms to maintain artificially high prices of
six stocks underwritten by Duke between 1995 and 1998. About 34,000
clients invested $171 million with Duke, according to Morgenthau.
The firm was the subject of 26 regulatory actions before it closed
in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Because Duke had offices in Manhattan and on Long Island, the
case could fall within the domain of either Morgenthau or Carter.
But Carter's intervention in a case under a state grand jury's
review for more than 18 months is unusual.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time a federal prosecutor has interfered
with a case brought by Morgenthau. In December 1997, he brought
securities fraud charges against Marisa Baridis, a former
compliance officer in the legal department at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter ho had fed confidential information about companies to
acquaintances. About a month later, Mary Jo White, the U.S.
attorney in Manhattan, took control of the case, arguing that
serious federal securities crime was her territory, not the
state's. Morgenthau's office had to dismiss its case against Ms.
Baridis, but prosecuted 10 others in the matter.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Baridis pleaded guilty to federal conspiracy and securities
fraud charges; she has yet to be sentenced.
</P>
<P>
   Defendants caught in a turf battle between state and federal
prosecutors can benefit by essentially choosing to be prosecuted by
the office providing the best deal. Federal prisons are generally
considered more appealing than state jails. In Wang's case, the
dispute may also result in a lesser sentence even if he admits to
having swindled investors.
</P>
<P>
   Securities lawyers say that as more investors jump into stocks,
opportunities rise for securities swindlers. Prosecutors well
understand the publicity that accrues from success in fraud cases,
and the battle to mount them is hotter than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors often say that they are better equipped than
their state counterparts to prosecute complex securities cases and
that prosecuting such crimes under state law diminishes their
seriousness.
</P>
<P>
   But Morgenthau's office has pursued white-collar crime and
securities fraud cases in recent years. In the last 18 months
alone, his office has brought 8 securities fraud cases against 61
individuals. The Duke case is one of the largest, but others
include the case against A.R. Baron, a brokerage firm, now defunct,
whose employees, prosecutors said, swindled investors out of $75
million.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's office is also investigating Stratton Oakmont, a
brokerage firm that attracted several regulatory actions before
being shut in 1996. Stratton's principals, Jordan Belfort and
Daniel Porush, were indicted on federal securities fraud and
money-laundering charges in September. Before starting Duke &AMP; Co.,
Wang was an executive at Stratton Oakmont.

ABC AND PANASONIC ANNOUNCE HIGH DEFINITION TV BROADCAST DEAL
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The ABC television network and the Panasonic Corp.
said on Tuesday that Panasonic would lend the network millions of
dollars worth of new equipment so that ABC can broadcast its Monday
night football games and the Super Bowl in high definition starting
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, expected to cost Panasonic about $10 million, is
the second cooperative arrangement between a network and an
equipment manufacturer announced this month. On May 9, the
Mitsubishi Electric Corp., a large maker of television sets, agreed
to underwrite CBS's costs to broadcast most of its prime-time
schedule in high definition beginning this fall.
</P>
<P>
   In late April, NBC began broadcasting ``The Tonight Show'' in
high definition with help from the Sony Corp. All of the
manufacturers hope the deals will help them sell more
high-definition television sets and broadcast equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Panasonic, a unit of the Matsushita Electric Industrial Corp.,
will build and equip a new mobile production truck used to televise
football games and equip it with high-definition cameras, switchers
and related equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ABC will use the gear to broadcast 17 Monday night football
games in high definition from Sept. 13 through Jan. 3, plus a
wildcard playoff game on Jan. 8 and the Super Bowl on Jan. 30.
</P>
<P>
   ABC agreed to give Panasonic free advertising in exchange for
the equipment. At the beginning of each game, said Preston Davis,
president of broadcast operations for ABC, the network will mention
Panasonic in an on-screen message. And Panasonic will get free
advertising time during the high-definition programming. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   More than half of all fourth-graders across New York state
failed the new English test given last January, which replaced an
old-fashioned multiple choice test with a three-day marathon that
required children to read long passages and write essays.
</P>
<P>
   The test _ a model being watched by educators across the country
_ was designed to set new, higher standards for reading and writing
that will help prepare children for high school graduation
requirements being phased in during the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   But the results left even some leaders of elite districts
smarting from results that showed only a small fraction of
students, 5 percent statewide, achieving advanced levels. In New
York City, two out of three students failed to meet the state
standards, and in a great many schools, the results were abysmal.
</P>
<P>
   The state education commissioner, Richard Mills, who imposed the
new test with the approval of the state Board of Regents, suggested
that the low statewide passing rate confirmed his prediction that
the new test would expose weaknesses in many schools that had been
papered over by the test it replaced. On that test, which measured
minimum competency, affluent suburban districts were accustomed to
seeing more than 90 percent of their students pass. On the new
test, many of those districts saw the percentages plunge into the
60s and 70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an exercise in truth telling,'' Mills said. ``Where do
we go from here? We have to go up, obviously.''
</P>
<P>
   The test was preceded by months of worry and feverish cramming.
Some teachers warned that it was too abstract for 9-year-olds.
Schools virtually suspended their normal curriculums to brush up on
concepts like ``the main idea,'' and some parents invested in
private tutoring.
</P>
<P>
   The results confirmed some of their worst fears.
</P>
<P>
   The test was scored in four levels, with students in levels 3
and 4 performing at or above the state standards for reading,
writing and listening and those in levels 1 and 2 failing to meet
the standards. The standards, developed by a panel of fourth-grade
teachers last fall, require students to read long passages of
literature and nonfiction, then answer questions and write essays
about them. Children must also listen to a passage read out loud,
take notes and then recall what they have heard. They are also
evaluated on spelling, grammar and punctuation.
</P>
<P>
   The new fourth-grade test replaces a multiple-choice test that
was given in third grade. The old test simply required children to
read short passages and fill in missing words. Statewide, 84
percent of third-graders passed the old test, which measured a
minimum level of competency; in New York City, 65 percent passed.
</P>
<P>
   On the new test, 48 percent of the state's 210,000 public-school
fourth- graders, including special education students, scored at or
above the standards, while 11 percent scored in the worst category,
meaning that they showed ``no evidence'' of performing at the
standards.
</P>
<P>
   The picture was even bleaker in New York City, which has always
lagged behind the rest of the state. Only 33 percent of the city's
65,000 fourth- graders passed the test, while 21 percent fell into
the worst category, compared with 6 percent in the rest of the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Mills recommended Tuesday that all students in the bottom level
be sent to summer school this year.
</P>
<P>
   In an indication of the how hard the test was, only 3 percent of
New York City's fourth-graders and 6 percent in the rest of the
state fell into the highest category.
</P>
<P>
   The scores include special education students, because, state
officials said, they wanted to make sure that no students were
excluded as a way of improving results.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Elmore, a professor of education at Harvard University,
said the test was one of the most challenging in the country, and
that New York students had done better on it than students in other
states, like Kentucky and Texas, that have aggressively used
testing to measure schools and students.
</P>
<P>
   ``What worries me is it brings out the anti-testing people,'' he
said. ``At this stage of the game, I think we have no option to
choose not to test. This test is much better than tests they've
been using in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   New York City's schools chancellor, Rudy Crew, contended that
the city had some cause to celebrate, because it had scored
slightly higher than the state's other big cities, Buffalo,
Rochester, Syracuse and Yonkers.

<P>
   Following are excerpts from the transcript of the guilty plea
entered by Justin Volpe in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, N.Y.,
Tuesday before Judge Eugene Nickerson. In making the plea, Volpe
was required to disclose details of his participation in the crime.
</P>
<P>
   The Attack and Prelude
</P>
<P>
   Volpe: At the Club Rendezvous I got into a fight with Abner
Louima. During this altercation I was struck by an individual and
knocked to the ground. When I regained my composure, I saw this
individual, whom I believed to be Abner Louima, running towards the
corner of Farragut and Flatbush Avenue. I now know that this
individual was not Abner Louima. I gave chase but I never seen him
again. The next time I saw Louima was at the location of Glenwood
and Bedford Avenue, where in the presence of other officers I
struck Louima once while we proceeded in the patrol car.
</P>
<P>
   While in the bathroom _ while in the bathroom at the precinct,
in the presence of another officer, I sodomized Louima by placing a
stick in his rectum. I then threatened to kill him if he told
anybody.
</P>
<P>
   For Patrick Antoine, while I was chasing Louima in the area of
Glenwood and Flatbush, a man who I later learned to be Patrick
Antoine was chasing me and I yelled at him, ``Why are you chasing
me?'' I pushed him and was knocked to the ground by another
officer, Officer Schofield. I then continued running after the man
who I thought was Abner Louima. I then caused the complaint to be
issued from the D.A.'s office against Patrick Antoine charging him
with assault on me.
</P>
<P>
   2nd Officer
</P>
<P>
   Volpe: While I was in the bathroom, there was another police
officer in the bathroom with me. That police officer saw what was
going on, did nothing to stop it. It was understood from the
circumstances that that police officer would do nothing to stop me
or report it to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Intent to Humiliate
</P>
<P>
   Judge Nickerson: Going back to the assault in the bathroom and
when you put the stick out towards his face, having shoved it into
his rectum, was a part of your effort to humiliate him?
</P>
<P>
   Volpe: I was in shock at the time, your Honor.
</P>
<P>
   Nickerson: You did intend to humiliate him, did you?
</P>
<P>
   Volpe: I intended to show it to him because _ I couldn't believe
what happened. Yes, if that humiliating him, I'm sure it did.
</P>
<P>
   Nickerson: Well, you intended to humiliate him, did you? You
thought you were mad at him?
</P>
<P>
   Volpe: I was mad at the time, yes.
</P>
<P>
   Nickerson: You intended to humiliate him?
</P>
<P>
   Volpe: Yes.

MATCHED SET: 2 JUDGES, 2 WEDDINGS, 2 SHOWS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By JAN HOFFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ O joy, O wretched excess: five bathrooms for two
people!
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Sheindlin, who schlepped to the Bronx criminal courts for
16 years, twinkles through a tour of his Sutton Place duplex on
Manhattan's East Side, delighted and dazed. He and his wife had
been public servants. But this? This is the house that TV bought.
</P>
<P>
   ``The white tornado decorated the whole place just like that,''
he whispers, snapping his fingers, referring to the woman he has
wed twice, known to millions as Judge Judy.
</P>
<P>
   Her Judgeship pads by, in tights and a sweater set, chasing a
yapping powder puff, ``Baby, baay-bee.''
</P>
<P>
   He: ``And this is our kitchen!'' Glares at her back. ``Too bad
you can't cook.''
</P>
<P>
   No response. He repeats the jab.
</P>
<P>
   Not bothering to look over, Judy waves her wrist and zings, ``I
ignore him; he's retired.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheindlin gazes heavenward. ``It's not easy being me,'' he
sighs.
</P>
<P>
   They crack up laughing, because the joke is too, too good. On
May 15, Gerald Sheindlin, 65, did retire as an acting justice of
New York's state Supreme Court. And like his wife, the former Judge
Judith Sheindlin of Manhattan Family Court, he has begun a TV
career. In September, he will make his debut as Judge Jerry of
``The People's Court,'' replacing Edward Koch, who named both
Sheindlins to the bench. Taping has started.
</P>
<P>
   But Jerry was a serious jurist! A man who published 65 opinions,
presided over 86 murder trials and thinks big thoughts about the
admissibility of DNA evidence! From this to small-claims silliness
on daytime TV and inevitable comparisons with his tempestuous soul
mate, star of the top syndicated daytime show?
</P>
<P>
   He settles into an armchair in a living room tastefully
appointed save for a 53-inch TV screen (his) and limns a life with
a trajectory from the heavy to the helium:
</P>
<P>
   Savage Bronx childhood. Immigrant parents. Father painted
houses, mother toiled in a tie factory, both punished their
ne'er-do-well son with fists, ropes, hangers, wooden spoons. Jerry
fell into petty crime and started a gang. Having reached his full
scrapper's height of 5 feet 6, he restricted membership to tough
guys no taller than 5 feet 7. They called themselves the
Kingsbridge Munchkins, and they said it with a swagger. He finished
school with a 68 average and joined the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   A Navy doctor became his mentor, imploring him to lose the Bronx
accent and find his brain, which he did. Long Island University
accepted him on probation. He got straight A's, graduated in 21/2
years, president of his class, and flew through Brooklyn Law
School.
</P>
<P>
   For someone bright and smoldering, criminal defense trials are a
fine outlet. Over the next 22 years, he built a booming practice
with Herbert Adlerberg, a law school buddy who is now also a judge.
``We had a feeling for the disadvantaged,'' Jerry recalls. He was
aggressive, meticulous and immodest.
</P>
<P>
   There was a first marriage, 12 years, two sons and a daughter,
and then a divorce. He rode motorcycles, was single for five years,
and his warm brown eyes still glow with memory.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976 at a bench-and-bar tavern, he met Judy, a hellacious
Family Court prosecutor, recently separated with two children. The
repartee began upon introduction and they married the following
year. His judgeship was approved in 1983. In the Bronx, he was
known as a strict, productive, impatient judge, but a sweetheart
when he took off the robes.
</P>
<P>
   Her Judgeship pads into the room and curls up with Lulu the
Baby.
</P>
<P>
   Judy: ``Is he nicer than me? No. He gives a nicer impression. I
am easier to live with.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry shakes his head softly. An entire nation has watched his
wife on television, and he knows he has an entire nation's
condolences.
</P>
<P>
   Judy: ``Who made the bed this morning?''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry: ``Whose dog peed on it? And you're supposed to be the
nicer person just because you made the bed?''
</P>
<P>
   They giggle. Weep not for Judge Jerry, who gives as good as he
gets. She's more confident and constant, middle-class, a Brooklyn
daddy's girl. He's moodier, sensitive, still scarred by childhood.
In 1991 they divorced, and in 1992 they remarried. She likes to
say, ``I have a lot of patience for him.'' Then, ``I need
interesting and Jerry's interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   So why did Sheindlin retire early and take the TV gig, which in
New York will be the lead-in show to his wife's? He used to love
being a judge, he says, but the passion dimmed. For starters, the
infamous acquitting Bronx jury does exist:
</P>
<P>
   ``Open-and-shut apartment burglary case,'' he says.
``Overwhelming evidence. Jury acquits. Afterward I said: `The
defendant has indicated he would like to thank you for your
verdict, and he asked me to give him your home addresses so he can
visit each of you and express his appreciation. So I did.' '' (He
didn't.)
</P>
<P>
   The nadir was the 1996 nonjury trial of Officer Francis Livoti
in the choking death of a Bronx man. Sheindlin was widely
criticized for acquitting the officer and for speaking to the
press.
</P>
<P>
   Repeating his explanation _ the prosecution's evidence was
conflicting _ Sheindlin looks mournful. ``I ruled in favor of
someone I couldn't stand and devastated the family that already had
a loss. It was the most difficult, disturbing, devastating case,
and it took its toll.''
</P>
<P>
   So this year, a TV producer appears: neither the cases nor the
verdicts are about life and death, and the salary jumps from
$135,000 a year to over a million. You have to ask?

GUILTY SOUL RETURNS CASH LOST IN TURNPIKE MISHAP
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Here's one for the faith-in-humanity file.
</P>
<P>
   A suspicious-looking package that arrived Monday at the office
of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey contained more
than $14,000, toll proceeds that fell off the back of an armored
truck last week on the New Jersey Turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   The money, in small bills and coins, was determined to be a part
of the $30,000 to $100,000 that authorities say spilled across the
southbound lanes on May 17, sparking a frenzied grabfest involving
dozens of drivers who ran from their cars as cash fluttered through
the air.
</P>
<P>
   State troopers gathered $2,236, and another $743 was later
turned in by people who said they had second thoughts about keeping
it.
</P>
<P>
   The money was from three days of tolls at the Holland Tunnel,
which is run by the Port Authority, and was headed to a
Philadelphia bank, said Sgt. Al Della Fave, a spokesman for the New
Jersey State Police.
</P>
<P>
   The armored car was owned by Coin Depot Corp. of Elizabeth,
N.J., whose drivers told officials that the back doors just swung
open without warning. Its executives did not return calls for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   When the cardboard box arrived at the Port Authority's offices
at the World Trade Center, workers were suspicious because the
parcel listed no name and the police initially said that the return
address was false. Bam Bam, a bomb-sniffing dog, was called in. The
dog expressed no interest, and the box was opened.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a pleasant surprise,'' said Greg Trevor, a Port
Authority spokesman, who added that the loss was insured.
Investigators are trying to track down those less forthcoming
through license numbers and videotape by cameras in police cars.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever sent the box had no interest in glory. A simple note
said, ``This money was found on the shoulder of the NJTP in very
torn bags.'' There was the return address of an Orthodox Catholic
church in Little Italy, St. Anthony of Padua.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, St. Anthony is the patron saint of lost things.
The Rev. Michael Verra, the pastor, said he knew nothing about the
cash, but that people do approach him: ``They give me things and
say: `I took this and I'm feeling very guilty about it. Would you
return it for me?'''

FORMER VOLUNTEERS SUE AOL, SEEKING BACK PAY FOR WORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LISA NAPOLI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two former volunteers for America Online have filed a
lawsuit in federal court in Manhattan in an attempt to obtain back
wages, saying that they and thousands of other volunteers should
have been compensated for their work.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs, Kelly Hallisey of Nassau County, N.Y., and Brian
Williams of Dallas, allege that AOL violated the Fair Labor
Standards Act, a federal law that mandates a minimum hourly wage
for employees, by using volunteers to perform work for the online
service.
</P>
<P>
   They and their lawyer, Leon Greenberg, said they were hoping
other volunteers for the online service would join the suit, which
was filed Monday. The amount of damages sought was not specified.
</P>
<P>
   The volunteers, called community leaders, perform a variety of
tasks for the service, like moderating online discussions and
overseeing other volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see it as a very simple case,'' Greenberg said Tuesday.
``AOL is a for-profit business. What community leaders did was very
essential to the service in terms of what they were selling to the
public. The minimum-wage laws require people get paid a minimum
wage. When AOL says, `These people were volunteers so we didn't
have to pay them,' I don't see it.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for AOL, Ann Brackbill, said no one at the company
had seen the complaint or could comment on it. But, she added, ``I
can tell you the company believes the community leader program
reflects industry practices and that community leaders are
volunteers.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit comes six weeks after several former volunteers,
including Ms. Hallisey, said the U.S. Labor Department was
investigating AOL for its use of unpaid labor in response to at
least seven separate complaints filed beginning last fall. AOL said
at the time that it had 10,000 volunteers.

FUND-RAISER WHO BROUGHT ASIAN MONEY TO DEMOCRATS TO PLEAD GUILTY TO
CONSPIRACY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to add sentence in 4th graf, clarifying the guilty plea.)  (rm) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ John Huang, the prolific fund-raiser at the center
of the furor over Democratic Party financing of President Clinton's
re-election, will plead guilty in federal court to a single felony
count of conspiring to make illegal contributions, the Justice
Department and Huang's lawyer said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A frequent White House visitor and prominent figure behind
Democratic efforts to solicit millions of dollars in political
contributions from Asian-Americans, Huang was part of a
fund-raising operation later found to be tainted by questionable or
illegal contributions. In at least one case, the money was funneled
through a top Chinese intelligence official.
</P>
<P>
   Huang refused to testify at congressional investigations, and
thus became an absent star at Capitol Hill hearings. Republicans
vilified him as a symbol of abuse. They accused him of using his
fund-raising prowess to launder contributions to the Democrats and
burrow his way deep into the Clinton administration through a job
at the Commerce Department on behalf of his financial patrons, the
Riady family of Indonesia and its Asian-based conglomerate, the
Lippo Group.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of the $3.4 million Huang raised during the 1996
election campaign was returned as potentially improper. The
specific charge to which he is expected to plead guilty, however,
relates to contributions raised earlier for campaigns in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Huang has for years seemed like a pivotal witness who could jump
start the Justice Department's criminal investigation of political
fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday, law-enforcement officials downplayed Huang's
significance, offering a mixed assessment of his cooperation.
Several officials suggested that he had provided no explosive
revelations and emerged as a lesser figure than he seemed after
congressional hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Still, other officials said they wanted to question Huang more
extensively about his relationship with the Riady family and his
dealings with presidential aides like Harold Ickes, a former White
House deputy chief of staff who helped manage fund-raising when
Huang was brought in as a fund-raiser for the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed plea agreement, which Huang is expected to formally
accept in a week or two, is unusual. Under one of its terms,
Justice Department officials said they will acknowledge that
investigators have unearthed no evidence that Huang engaged in any
espionage or violated national security laws, Justice Department
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   That finding would directly rebut and, in effect, dismiss an
important conclusion by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee,
which investigated how the Democrats financed Clinton's
re-election. In its March 1998 report, the panel found that China
wanted to influence political campaigns and policies in Washington
and that Huang ``may possibly'' have had a direct financial
relationship with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Another provision in the deal would grant Huang sentencing
leniency in exchange for his cooperation, which has been underway
for the last six months, Justice Department officials said. Under
the arrangement, he would be spared jail and placed on one-year's
probation. Under the law, he could be sentenced to a maximum of
five years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am greatly relieved for John and his family that his ordeal
is almost over,'' said Ty Cobb, Huang's attorney, who confirmed
that Huang would plead guilty under the terms of the deal outlined
by the Justice Department. ``I also commend the Justice Department
for stepping up to the plate and acknowledging that John is not and
never was a spy.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans scoffed at the deal, accusing the Justice
Department of allowing Huang to escape punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what information they're getting, but it
certainly appears to be a sweetheart deal,'' said Michael Madigan,
the former Republican chief counsel for the Senate investigating
committee. ``It certainly looks like they've got the rug pulled up
and the broom in the other hand. I hope that isn't the case.''
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Department officials said that, in the end, the case
against Huang was weaker and narrower than they initially believed.
The conspiracy charge against Huang dates back to a period between
1992 and 1994 and focuses on two contributions totaling $7,500, one
to a mayoralty candidate in Los Angeles, the other to a California
Democratic fund. He was not charged with any specific act related
to his fund raising for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb would not discuss the nature or extent of Huang's
cooperation, but law enforcement officials said that Huang had been
meeting extensively with investigators from the Justice
Department's campaign finance unit and from the offices of several
independent counsels, including the Whitewater prosecutor, Kenneth
Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Huang did not make an appearance Tuesday. Justice Department
officials, who filed the one-count criminal information in federal
court in Los Angeles, said he would acknowledge wrongdoing in
exchange for a deal in which he will be placed on a year of
probation without a jail sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The deal suggested that prosecutors are re-energizing the nearly
3-year-old campaign finance inquiry. Last Friday, Yah Lin Trie, a
Democratic fund-raiser and longtime Arkansas friend of Clinton,
pleaded guilty in Little Rock to political fund-raising charges and
agreed to cooperate with the Justice Department's campaign finance
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   But with Trie said by some officials to be unlikely to provide
revelations and with Huang shedding little new light on the issue,
it is unclear whether the Justice Department is preparing for a new
prosecutorial assault or is, as some officials predict, nearing the
end of the long inquiry.

A TALE OF TWO JALEN ROSES: WHICH ONE WILL SHOW UP? 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two coaches named Larry observed at different times two players
named Jalen Rose. The two coaches were separate entities, while
Jalen Rose was solely the party of the third part.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shouldn't be in the league,'' Larry Brown, his former coach
with the Indiana Pacers, had said at one point about Rose, a
talented, 6-foot-8-inch player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of confidence in Jalen,'' said Larry Bird, his
present coach. ``He's a very good player and he could become one of
the better players in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, and for several days following, the Knicks will get a
good opportunity to view Rose as they open the Eastern Conference
finals against the Indiana Pacers in Market Square Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Rose got into a scrape with Patrick Ewing in the Knicks' lone
victory over the Pacers in three games. But he will not be Ewing's
problem, though he may well be Latrell Sprewell's. Rose is the
Pacer who may likely take advantage of Sprewell's periodic lapses
on defense.
</P>
<P>
   But which Rose will appear? Will it be the one who blooms into a
slasher and scorer, who can also flower as an outside scorer? And
on defense, will it be the one demonstrating his prowess by nipping
the speedy Sprewell in the bud? Or will this particular Rose fade
into the floorboards?
</P>
<P>
   A pair of Jalen Roses were apparent in the Pacers' sweep of the
Philadelphia 76ers, the team now coached by Larry Brown. In Game 1
on May 17, Rose _ who has the speed, strength and versatility to
play point guard, shooting guard or small forward, and does all
three when called upon by Bird _ led his team in scoring with 27
points on 9 baskets on 16 attempts after coming off the bench and
playing 30 minutes. In the fourth and final game on Sunday, he
scored 5 points on 1 basket in 11 tries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rode him too long,'' said Bird, who had played Rose for 21
minutes. ``Usually, with Jalen, if he doesn't start quickly, he
doesn't have it the whole game. It was probably one of his worst
games all year. He really got nothing accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Bird said nothing to Rose. He didn't have to.
``Larry believes that you're a professional and he treats you like
one,'' Rose said. ``You're supposed to know what's expected of you,
and when you screw up, he knows you know. What's there to be
said?''
</P>
<P>
   There were times when Brown didn't have much to say about Rose,
either. And there was a period during Brown's tenure with the
Pacers when he didn't allow Rose to play for 14 straight games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had said to Larry, `You've got to work with this kid and
help him,''' recalled Donnie Walsh, the Pacers' general manager.
``But they got off on the wrong foot. And I think that Larry
learned something having to coach Allen Iverson. Some of these
younger kids have a sing-songy little act. You have to get to
understand it. And I have seen Jalen grow and mature.''
</P>
<P>
   This season, Brown admitted a mistake with the Pacers. ``I
mishandled Jalen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers had traded Mark Jackson to the Denver Nuggets for
Rose after the 1996 season. Rose had entered the NBA as one of the
cocky Fab Five crew from the University of Michigan, and in his two
years with Denver did little to dispel a reputation as a spoiled
brat, arguing at times with Dan Issel, his coach there.
</P>
<P>
   When Walsh traded for Rose, it was anticipated that he would be
the Pacers' point guard. But that didn't work to Brown's
satisfaction. The Pacers traded again with the Nuggets, bringing
back Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rose never talked back to Larry,'' Walsh said, referring to
Brown, ``but he pouted. It wasn't so much what he said that
bothered Larry, it was the body language. That kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   When Brown left Indiana to take the job in Philadelphia two
seasons ago, and Bird arrived on the scene, Rose believed that he
would get another chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was eager and ready for a fresh start,'' he said. ``I
embraced the idea of learning from the best. I remember that when
Larry played he had ice water in his veins. And he's the same as a
coach. He's the same person regardless of the score, the situation
or the environment. It seems impossible to do, but he succeeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose still doesn't start, nor does Sprewell. In contrast to
Sprewell, who still bridles about not starting, Rose has acquiesced
to the situation. His attitude, according to Bird, is highly
professional, and he has led the Pacers' bench in scoring with 11
points a game, the highest average of his five-year career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Jalen wants to be a point guard, and wants to lead a
team,'' Bird said. ``And one day I think he will. He's still only
26 years old. But right now Mark Jackson is doing a great job for
us there, and I've told Jalen that he is most valuable to us in his
versatility. And he's accepted that. He's our best player on the
wing, because he's a better dribbler than Reggie Miller, and when
Jalen penetrates he can pass better than Reggie, rather than having
to force a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird was asked how he keeps Rose happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give him minutes,'' he said, with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Rose is usually off the bench and into the game before
the end of the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But what happens when Rose has a game like the last one against
Philadelphia?
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems he sometimes loses focus,'' Walsh said. ``You can see
it on his face. When he's into it, his shot selection is sharper,
his passes are sharper, and so is his defense. In the conference
finals last year against the Bulls, when we took them to seven
games, I thought Jalen did a very good job on Michael Jordan. I
thought he kept him from driving to the basket. But then in
Philadelphia Sunday, the first thing Jalen did when he came into
the game was throw the ball away. I said, `Oh, oh, this doesn't
look good.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``But we need him focused for the Knicks. He makes a big
difference for us.''  &QL;

LYNDON LYON IS DEAD AT 94; A BREEDER OF AFRICAN VIOLETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lyndon Waldo Lyon, a horticulturist who was turned into an
African violet fanatic by a single leaf and who played a major role
in making the African violet one of the country's favorite
houseplants, died May 19 at Little Falls Hospital in Little Falls,
N.Y. He was 94.
</P>
<P>
   Lyon's passion for the exotic and hardy purple-flowering plant,
which was introduced to the United States around the turn of the
century, led him to develop about 800 varieties, including the
spectacular double-pink and star flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Professional botanists say his cross-breeding, or hybridization,
established him as the world's most important breeder of African
violets. He also built a thriving international mail-order
business, and his greenhouses in Dolgeville, N.Y., 25 miles east of
Utica, became a mecca for thousands of plant fanciers.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bartolomei, an official at the New York Botanical Garden
in the Bronx, who knew Lyon in the late 1970s and early 1980s, said
that most of the African violets seen today are varieties bred by
Lyon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He created the ideal houseplant,'' Bartolomei said. ``They
will flower most of the year. They're small in size, only about 6
inches tall, so you can fit several on a windowsill. Unlike
orchids, they don't require much humidity. And they can suffer
abuse. If you forget to water them and they wilt, you can usually
bring them back.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyon's devotion to the African violets, species of the genus
Saintpaulia, began in 1949 with the gift of a single African violet
leaf from his niece. An African violet leaf placed in water or damp
soil soon sprouts roots and becomes a full-fledged plant.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, he set up an African violet nursery under artificial
lights in his home; there he studied the plant and experimented
with hybridization through cross-pollination. When the seeds of a
plant that has received the pollen of another variety are grown,
the offspring may share the characteristics of the parent plants.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1950s, Lyon was operating a greenhouse with 5,000
plants, including the double-pink, a flower with multiple layers of
petals, which created a sensation at the 1954 national convention
of the African Violet Society of America in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Next, in 1956, came the star, an African violet with all five
points about equal in size. Previously, African violets had three
lower petals larger than the upper two. Two years later, Lyon
developed stars in many colors, some of which were frilled. Later
came miniatures.
</P>
<P>
   By 1982, Lyon was selling more 100,000 plants a year, both
retail and wholesale. That same year he sold the business to his
grandson Paul Sorano, who continues to operate the Lyndon Lyon
Greenhouses in Dolgeville.
</P>
<P>
   Lyon made an important breakthrough by breeding the single
pure-red star-shaped African violet, Bartolomei said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became a basic plant we use as a breeding stock,'' he said.
``The red is recessive, so when we breed it with blue we get a very
good, a very pure, blue.''
</P>
<P>
   When his family moved to Dolgeville in 1921, Lyon completed the
ninth and 10th grades at the Dolgeville High School but then
dropped out of school to work on the family farm.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he became a machinist and held a number of odd jobs, but
soon began breeding African violets in his home.
</P>
<P>
   In recognition of his ingenuity and constant search for new and
different colors and forms, Lyon was showered with awards,
trophies, ribbons and plaques. In 1984, he was awarded honorary
life membership in the African Violet Society of America. Last
month he was inducted into the society's hall of fame in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Lyon's wife of 70 years, the former Ruth Adelaide Pierce, died
in 1995. Lyon is survived by a daughter, Betty Sorano of
Dolgeville; a son, Robert of Arlington, Va.; two brothers, Murray
of Dolgeville and Theodore of Cobleskill; a sister, Rosalyn Lein of
Dolgeville; seven grandchildren; 12 great-grandchildren, and four
great-great-grandchildren.

EDITORIAL: AMERICA'S STOLEN SECRETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, May 26:
</P>
<P>
   A devastating pattern of security lapses is laid out in the
congressional report on China's acquisition of America's most vital
nuclear and missile secrets. Beijing remains far from nuclear
parity with the United States. But a bipartisan House committee,
headed by Christopher Cox, R-Calif.,, found that China has
systematically exploited poor security at American nuclear weapons
labs, lax satellite licensing and weak export control laws to speed
work on a new generation of nuclear weapons and missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Though some of the committee's findings have been outlined in
news accounts over recent months, the report adds fresh detail and
serves as a powerful indictment of failed security and law
enforcement by Democratic and Republican administrations dating
back to the 1970s. The Clinton administration, in particular, has a
great deal of explaining to do about its anemic response when it
first learned of possible Chinese espionage. The Cox committee has
performed an invaluable public service with its unsparing
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The committee found that China had obtained classified
information on seven of America's most modern thermonuclear
weapons. These include the miniaturized bombs used in
multiple-warhead missiles as well as in missiles launched from
mobile platforms and from submarines. With this information, China
may be able to produce similar weapons of its own. The stolen
material, including computer codes that are essential to warhead
design, most likely came from supposedly secure computers at
America's nuclear weapons laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   The report also found that Beijing had exploited commercial
deals with American aerospace companies to learn how to avoid
launch failures and design missiles more capable of delivering
multiple warheads. The committee specifically found that two
companies, Hughes Electronics and Loral Space and Communications,
improperly advised the Chinese on rocket design in the mid-1990s
without obtaining State Department licenses for such discussions.
Despite these breakdowns, the Clinton administration shifted
authority for licensing satellite sales from the security-minded
State Department to the business-oriented Commerce Department, a
decision wisely reversed by Congress last year. Though earlier
administrations also failed to secure America's nuclear secrets,
the Clinton administration's performance seems especially abysmal.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the failure of the national security adviser,
Samuel Berger, to respond more vigorously when first briefed about
possible nuclear espionage three years ago requires further
inquiry. At a minimum Berger should have informed President Clinton
and Vice President Gore, coordinated investigative efforts and made
sure that his request for tightened security at the labs was
carried out immediately. He also played an important role in the
mistaken decision to give the Commerce Department lead authority in
satellite licensing decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Republican calls for Berger's resignation feel premature, but
his fitness is in question and must be carefully weighed in the
days ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly disturbing is the failure two years ago by Janet
Reno's Justice Department to authorize government investigators to
pursue a wiretap of the principal suspect, Wen Ho Lee. Justice's
handling of the Lee investigation was lackadaisical. This is but
the latest in a series of law-enforcement lapses or political
blunders that would have led to Ms. Reno's removal in any recent
administration other than this one. Serious lapses also occurred at
the Energy Department, which, at least until Bill Richardson took
over as secretary last fall, failed to assert managerial control
over the national weapons labs.
</P>
<P>
   Congress must continue investigating these issues of
responsibility, taking care, as the Cox committee did, to avoid
sensationalism and undue partisanship. Together with the
administration, it should also move quickly to assure better
protection of America's national security secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Better coordination is needed among the various intelligence and
law-enforcement agencies in detecting, investigating and
prosecuting nuclear espionage. The Energy Department must clearly
demonstrate that it can manage the labs. Otherwise it may make
sense to transfer them to Pentagon control. Whichever department is
in charge, more rigorous security screening is needed for those
engaged in the most sensitive weapons work.
</P>
<P>
   Export-control laws, excessively relaxed at the end of the Cold
War and further loosened as part of the Clinton administration's
efforts to encourage commerce with China, must be significantly
tightened, particularly with regard to satellites and
supercomputers.
</P>
<P>
   The Cox report makes clear the seriousness of Chinese efforts to
acquire militarily sensitive technology and underscores America's
vulnerability to such efforts. Stricter export laws and tighter
security at nuclear weapons laboratories will help safeguard
American secrets. But at least as important is a more careful
approach on the part of the Clinton administration to dealings with
China. Beijing is worth cultivating as a diplomatic and commercial
partner. But its potential threat to American national security
should never be ignored or underestimated.  &QL;

THE KNICKS' AMAZING RUN 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, May 26:
</P>
<P>
   The dreaded Indiana Pacers come next, so now is the time to
savor the advance of the New York Knickerbockers, who seemed dead
in April, to the Eastern Conference finals. The Knicks first beat
the heavily favored Miami Heat, exacting delightful revenge against
former coach Pat Riley, then swept the Atlanta Hawks in four games.
They did it with their crippled superstar, Patrick Ewing, playing
at half speed; with a creative second unit that has outplayed
everyone else's first team, and with Latrell Sprewell, a talented
player and erratic personality best known for choking his former
coach before the Knicks brought him to New York.
</P>
<P>
   They also did it despite some off-court distractions that simply
make the on-court heroics more delicious. Back when the Knicks were
21-21 and in danger of not making the playoffs, Dave Checketts, the
president of Madison Square Garden, demoted the team's general
manager, Ernie Grunfeld, who had assembled this team, and met with
Phil Jackson, who before retiring had coached the Chicago Bulls to
six league championships. This was not a dumb thing to do, since
Checketts is paid to think about the organization's future. What
was dumb was that he lied about the meeting after The New York
Times revealed it. Checketts has since apologized to all concerned,
including Jeff Van Gundy, the present coach, but he still looks
bad.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy, though, is looking good, at least for now. Checketts
may not believe in him, but the fans are behind him. When Ewing
tires, Van Gundy puts in Chris Dudley, a plodder whose role is to
do a Jesse Ventura number on the other team's big man while the
rest of the Knicks' second unit, chiefly Sprewell and Marcus Camby,
run like crazy and find open shots. Beginning Sunday we will learn
whether this works against Indiana, a team with a good second unit
of its own and, of course, Reggie Miller, who seems put on earth to
torment Spike Lee and the rest of the Madison Square Garden
faithful.

STRUGGLING RACING BODIES MAY DECIDE TO REUNITE 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four years after Championship Auto Racing Teams and the Indy
Racing League split up, damaging the appeal of open-wheel racing in
the United States, the two rival series may be secretly planning a
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Craig, CART's chairman, and Tony George, the IRL
president, have had face-to-face meetings as recently as last week,
according to a high-ranking motorsports executive. Bill France, the
president of Nascar and the new owner of four tracks where CART has
races, was also present.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent meeting was in Indianapolis, and the sides
discussed the parameters of a reunification, which could happen by
the end of this year, the executive said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Both CART and the IRL have suffered since they parted company in
1995, when conflicting egos and differing ideals led CART to leave
the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, home of the Indianapolis 500. The
series differed over the engines used and the cost of operating the
teams.
</P>
<P>
   But it has become clear to both sides that to thrive, the two
series must be unified.
</P>
<P>
   Fans are not filling seats at the tracks for either series'
races, and television ratings are also poor. A prime example of fan
apathy was the abundance of hotel rooms available in downtown
Indianapolis on Tuesday, four days before the Indianapolis 500,
which is supposed to be open-wheel racing's premier event. The
500's luster has been dulled by the rift, and the reason is simple:
CART won't be there. The cars are different, and the drivers'
contracts keep them from racing in each other's series.
</P>
<P>
   CART's drivers will be racing Saturday in the Motorola 300 at
Gateway International Raceway in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   While fans want all of the best open-wheel drivers competing in
the same race, that won't happen Sunday when the green flag is
waved at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. But if the talk in
Gasoline Alley is true, there is that possibility for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Here is what has been fueling the speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Roger Penske, one of CART's founders and
ardent supporters, sold four tracks to the International Speedway
Corp., which is owned by France. So now International Speedway is
the promoter of four CART races (in Brooklyn, Mich., Nazareth, Pa.,
Fontana, Calif., and Homestead, Fla.) and one IRL race (in
Phoenix).
</P>
<P>
   France has kept his intentions quiet, but he now has a vested
interest in open-wheel racing's success. France may try to broker a
deal between CART and the IRL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Promoting open-wheel racing is not going to hurt Nascar,'' a
Nascar official said. ``In Bill France's eyes, strengthening
motorsports in America helps everyone, including Nascar.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, ABC secured the rights to the Indianapolis 500 and
the IRL for five years, even as television ratings have continued
to slump. ABC already owns the rights to CART. ABC's executives
might expect something drastic to reverse the trend of low ratings
for both series.
</P>
<P>
   And there are other less significant hints that something is in
the works. CART has not released its plans for an engine formula
for next season, meaning any plans could be changed with relative
ease. Also, the most successful chassis builder in CART, Reynard,
recently acquired Riley &AMP; Scott, which builds IRL chassis.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are many obstacles that stand between a CART-IRL
merger, thus making it expensive and complicated. The biggest
potential snag concerns the engine manufacturers: CART engine
suppliers lease the engines to teams, while IRL engine builders
sell them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants to make a $20 million commitment on an engine
program if we're never going to make it,'' said a motorsports
executive who is affiliated with CART. ``But even if the CART and
the IRL were to reach a compromise, it's probably too late for
engine suppliers to have something ready for 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``There are signs all around that something is in the
works. After all this time, I don't want to get my hopes up. But
you would have to be blind or an idiot not to realize that these
guys need each other.''  &QL;

BAFFERT'S FILLY RUNS 6 FURLONGS IN 1:10 4/5 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Silverbulletday, the best 3-year-old filly in racing, worked a
sizzling six furlongs at Churchill Downs on Tuesday. But her
trainer, Bob Baffert, would still not say that she would try to
thwart Charismatic's bid to sweep the Triple Crown in the Belmont
Stakes one week from Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're out of it till we say we're in it,'' Baffert said in the
cryptic style he used before the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness.
``But right now, it's looking better. I want to see how she came
out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert watched his star filly fly six furlongs in 1:10 4/5 at
Churchill Downs, but then declined to commit her to the Belmont
although he seemed to be holding the door open. He played a similar
guessing game before the Derby, then ran her the day before in the
Kentucky Oaks, which she won. Two weeks later, he entered her in
the Preakness, then scratched her after she drew a bad post
position. Instead, he ran her in the Black-Eyed Susan, which she
also won.
</P>
<P>
   Silverbulletday now has won 11 of her 12 starts, but has not yet
tested colts.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just did her work,'' Baffert said, describing Tuesday's
workout. Then, sounding ambivalent again, he added: ``It was an
amazing work. A little too fast for me. Look, there were too many
horses in the Derby, and she drew a bad post position for the
Preakness. The Belmont may suit her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, the down side is the distance, a mile and a half. But if
you're going to take a shot, now's the time. If I think she can do
it, we'll take the shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Pegram, Silverbulletday's owner, was on hand for her
workout on Tuesday and afterward seemed to be tilting toward the
Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's pretty fast, huh?'' he said of his star horse. ``If we
go to New York, we want to win the race.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, said Pegram, if Silverbulletday ships to New York, it
will be for only one reason _ to run in the Belmont, even though
the Acorn, a marquee race for 3-year-old fillies, will be run the
day before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't going to cross-enter her in anything,'' Pegram said.
``If she goes to New York, she's going to run the Belmont, nothing
else. I guarantee that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Churchill Downs track took on an all-star tone yesterday
when Charismatic also worked out, but he did it without great
expectations or great speed, just an easy six furlongs in
1:16 &LR; gffraction &LR; 3 5 . His trainer, D. Wayne Lukas, said his colt
would work once more before shipping to Belmont next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was more to give him a mental or energy edge,'' Lukas
said of the workout. ``When this whole thing started, I had hoped
he'd move forward from the Derby to the Preakness, then I just
wanted him in condition for the Belmont. But I think we're going to
move forward again.''
</P>
<P>
   The horse's owner, Bob Lewis, said from Los Angeles that the
slow time of the workout did not concern him, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we need to put a strong workout into him at this
point,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Then he punctuated the point by saying: ``Charismatic dropped
from 31-1 in the Kentucky Derby to 8-1 in the Preakness. So, I
guess he's moving in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was asked whether he thought Baffert was waffling on
entering his filly in the Belmont, and he noted that Baffert had
trained many horses for him, including Silver Charm, who won the
Kentucky Derby and the Preakness in 1997 before losing the Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd been with Bob as a trainer for nine years, and with Wayne
for seven,'' he replied. ``People can change their minds. If they
feel confident, I hope they'll be there. I would like to see
Silverbulletday in the race. But I know Mike Pegram will make the
right decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The Belmont Stakes presented a strange twist of fate for
Baffert. Twice in the last two years, he won the Kentucky Derby and
the Preakness but both times lost the Belmont in the final strides
and also the chance to sweep the Triple Crown. Now, he was watching
Lukas standing on the doorstep of the Triple Crown with
Charismatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Silver Charm was beaten by Touch Gold, who was fresher and ran
a great race,'' Baffert recalled. ``Last year, Real Quiet lost with
an unlucky bob of the head. Charismatic is just a race horse. He
gets there and grinds it out.''

ELWAY HUDDLES WITH L.A. MAGNATE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- John Elway, the man in the middle of the
ownership fight for Los Angeles' pro football franchise, views the
warring bidders as being at ``opposite ends of the spectrum,'' his
agent said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Elway, the retired Denver Broncos superstar quarterback who
would bring a marquee name to the L.A. market, has gradually
arrived at that conclusion following a series of meetings with
billionaire Eli Broad and entertainment mogul Michael Ovitz, the
leaders of the competing groups, said Marvin Demoff, a Los Angeles
attorney.
</P>
<P>
   The latest meeting, a 2{-hour session between Elway and Broad in
Fort Lauderdale on Sunday, was the longest to date, with Elway
indicating a deepening comfort level with the local billionaire,
according to Demoff, who spoke with Elway after the session.
</P>
<P>
   Broad said no commitments were made but he came away with the
impression that if Elway comes back to Los Angeles as part of a
football expansion franchise, the Granada Hills native will come as
part of Broad's ownership group.
</P>
<P>
   ``He indicated that if he does anything, he'd do it with us,''
Broad said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Demoff said Elway told Broad he is growing more comfortable with
him, and the possibility of joining his group.
</P>
<P>
   The courting of Elway illustrates some of those differences,
with Broad to date spending considerably more time in both casual
and business talks with the football great.
</P>
<P>
   Broad said he offered Elway the presidency and an investment
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz has held ``preliminary'' discussions with Elway and would
be willing to meet with him again, according to the ownership
group's adviser, attorney Mark Fabiani, a former deputy mayor under
Tom Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Demoff said Elway might meet with Ovitz at some point ``for
clarification.''
</P>
<P>
   Broad and Demoff said the Florida meeting, in an airport
conference room outside the media spotlight, covered a wide range
of topics and addressed several business aspects that could impact
Elway's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``John had a much greater opportunity to find out from Eli Broad
how he might fit into the plans, including his opportunity to
invest,'' Demoff said. ``All of that was clarified.''
</P>
<P>
   Broad said the meeting was a chance for him and Elway to ``get
to know one another, to find out what he's interested in.''
</P>
<P>
   The conversation ranged from Elway's college and professional
careers to family concerns, and business and investment
opportunities and interests, Broad said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The meeting was very constructive and John was encouraged by
Broad as to where he would fit into his operation,'' Demoff said.
``Both parties were encouraged how they might work together.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway, however, indicated he is in no hurry to make a final
decision, wanting to take time with his family first and to
carefully consider what and where he should begin a new career,
Demoff said.
</P>
<P>
   Broad said Elway's business acumen impressed him, and that he
had strong recommendations from Pat Bowlen, owner of the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   Sources suggested, too, that Elway would not want to commit to
an L.A. team until he could be assured of its success.
</P>
<P>
   ``John is in the exploring stage,'' Demoff said.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Soboroff, Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan's point person
in bringing professional football back to the Los Angeles Memorial
Coliseum, said Elway would play an important role.
</P>
<P>
   ``He adds passion for the sport,'' Soboroff said. ``That's a
huge factor to the NFL. You can have passion for the economics, for
the community, for the pizazz of it, but it's the passion for the
sport that's going to be one of the main components, and Elway
provides that.''

<P>
   ATLANTA -- In the belabored soap opera that has become the NFL
granting an expansion franchise to Los Angeles, league owners came
up with yet another twist Tuesday when they suggested the two
competing ownership groups get together at the eleventh hour.
</P>
<P>
   Again impressed by the glitz and scope of Michael Ovitz's new
Coliseum plan presented Monday, but apparently recognizing all the
site know-how belonged to the two-year effort of the Eli Broad-Ed
Roski Jr. group, NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said at the owners
meetings that he had urged the two rivals to make happy and merge.
</P>
<P>
   Although the idea has been floated before -- and rejected by
Ovitz -- this was the first time the NFL had directly pushed for a
joint effort.
</P>
<P>
   Broad, who flew back to Los Angeles on Tuesday, said he had yet
to speak with Tagliabue or anyone else from the NFL about the
proposed merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ovitz brought a very nice model, which some of them liked very
much,'' Broad said. ``The problem is really very simple. They
realized during our presentation that it couldn't be built. Plus,
there's no way the state is going to fund their $225 million for
parking structures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they thought, although we like the Ovitz plan, Roski
and Broad know all the rules of engagement. . . . Our door is open
if he wants to suggest some things. I have always said our main
priority is to get a first-rate stadium and an NFL team, and we'll
do whatever it takes to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Few, however, have been able to visualize the two strong-willed
men coming together. Ovitz, the Hollywood super agent, is renowned
for wanting to be in control and has shown no interest in taking a
subordinate role in team ownership.
</P>
<P>
   And Broad made it clear that although he was still open to Ovitz
joining his group, it would be in a minority ownership role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to remain the principal owner,'' Broad said. ``Mike has
a lot of talent. I have always had great respect for his abilities.
But I think my business and financial accomplishments are second to
none. He could have a very significant role, possibly in marketing
and promotions, something he is very good at.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL requires that a team's principal owner have at least 30
percent of the team. Broad said he and Roski can provide 100
percent of the franchise cost, but are willing to take the 30
percent minimum each, leaving 40 percent of team ownership
available to others.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already been talking to some people in the entertainment
industry and (former Broncos quarterback) John Elway about being
part owners,'' Broad said. ``If Ovitz wants to join us, there is 10
to 20 percent available to each.''
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz was flying back to Los Angeles on Tuesday night and could
not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue all but endorsed Ovitz's splashy plans for renovating
the Coliseum in a press conference at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the plan offered by Michael Ovitz presents exactly the
kind of vision that we feel is necessary to transform the venue in
the best interest of the fans and the city of Los Angeles, which
would also be in the best interest of the National Football
League,'' Tagliabue said.
</P>
<P>
   But when the two competing groups presented an update of their
Coliseum plans to the expansion committee Monday night, Broad
stressed that his group had been working with the multiple agencies
involved in redesigning the Coliseum for more than two years and
was the only plan that could get built.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz originally planned a new stadium in Carson, and had only
six weeks to formulate a new design for the Coliseum after it was
selected as the franchise site last month.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz has yet to meet with any of the agencies that have control
over the Exposition Park area. And his optimum plan calls for seven
parking garages at an estimated $225 million that would require
state funding.
</P>
<P>
   But Tagliabue said the two groups had come together on the
general stadium size and the need for at least one parking garage
and said it was time they examined combining forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked to both groups coming together and unifying their
efforts,'' Tagliabue said. ``We think whether it's a merger,
whether it's a consolidation, whether it's working together in the
next phase, that's what has to be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the site development plans, everybody can work together and
come out with THE plan, then we think we'd be better off than going
on two different tracks, which involve two different plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any specific thinking about what form their
working together would take on. What we're trying to do is move
ahead in a constructive way, rather than having a competition which
can be both time-consuming and counterproductive.''
</P>
<P>
   The day had not begun well for Broad. Both groups were invited
to make a shortened version of the plans they presented Monday
night to the expansion committee to all team owners Tuesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz was told to return Monday night, but the league did not
inform Broad of its plans until Tuesday morning, by which time he
was already flying home.
</P>
<P>
   John Semcken, the group's executive vice president, and John
McKay, its director of football operations, were forced to step in
for Broad.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Raiders owner Al Davis -- who moved his team from the
Coliseum to Oakland four years ago -- continued to bemoan the
league turning down his plans for a privately financed stadium at
Hollywood Park and to maintain a claim on the Los Angeles area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The L.A. opportunity does belong to us,'' Davis said. ``That
doesn't mean some other team can't move there, but they certainly
owe us the difference in the L.A. opportunity and the Oakland
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can speculate on the amount. If you speculated $700
million, you wouldn't be wrong.''

next phase, that's what has to be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the site development plans, everybody can work together and
come out with THE plan, then we think we'd be better off than going
on two different tracks, which involve two different plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any specific thinking about what form their
working together would take on. What we're trying to do is move
ahead in a constructive way, rather than having a competition which
can be both time-consuming and counterproductive.''

   The day had not begun well for Broad. Both groups were invited
to make a shortened version of the plans they presented Monday
night to the expansion committee to all team owners Tuesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz was told to return Monday night, but the league did not
inform Broad of its plans until Tuesday morning, by which time he
was already flying home.
</P>
<P>
   John Semcken, the group's executive vice president, and John
McKay, its director of football operations, were forced to step in
for Broad.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Raiders owner Al Davis -- who moved his team from the
Coliseum to Oakland four years ago -- continued to bemoan the
league turning down his plans for a privately financed stadium at
Hollywood Park and to maintain a claim on the Los Angeles area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The L.A. opportunity does belong to us,'' Davis said. ``That
doesn't mean some other team can't move there, but they certainly
owe us the difference in the L.A. opportunity and the Oakland
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can speculate on the amount. If you speculated $700
million, you wouldn't be wrong.''
