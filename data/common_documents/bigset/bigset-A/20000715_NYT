PLAN WOULD GIVE BOOST TO MIDDLE-CLASS TEAMS
</HEADLINE>
  By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seeking to correct a mushrooming competitive imbalance because
of payroll disparity, baseball's latest economic study committee
presented a plan Friday that would seem to take from the rich and
give not to the poor but to the middle class.
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, did not
attend the owners meeting, where the 87-page report was presented,
but it was primarily his money _ as well as Fred Wilpon and Nelson
Doubleday's and that of a few other owners _ that the four-man
panel took aim at in one of the major elements of its plan.
</P>
<P>
   Following an 18-month study, the panel members recommended that
the owners share 40 to 50 percent of their local revenue, levy a 50
percent competitive-balance tax on portions of payrolls above $84
million, encourage clubs to have a minimum payroll of $40 million
and withhold central-fund money from clubs that did not reach the
minimum.
</P>
<P>
   As ways of enhancing the talent on weaker teams and keeping
wealthy teams from gobbling up the best amateur players, the report
also advocated a worldwide draft of amateur players, changes in the
existing drafts of amateur and minor league players, allowing the
trading of draft choices and elimination of compensation picks for
lost free agents.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also said financially troubled clubs should be
permitted to relocate more readily. No Major League Baseball team
has moved since 1972.
</P>
<P>
   The four independent members of the panel were George Mitchell,
the former Senate majority leader; Paul Volcker, the former
chairman of the Federal Reserve; Richard Levin, the president of
Yale University; and the columnist George Will.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball, Will said at a news conference at the Waldorf-Astoria
in Manhattan, ``can get well by deciding to get well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Failure to act promptly will have grave consequences,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the panel's recommendations are enhancements of
practices already in place. In negotiations for the last collective
bargaining agreement, for example, the clubs increased the amount
of revenue they share, with money being transferred from the
highest-revenue clubs to the lowest. But the panel cited the
so-called local revenue as perhaps the biggest component of the
disparity in the teams' economic status.
</P>
<P>
   The committee said that local revenue _ gate receipts, local
television and radio contracts and stadium signage _ was really
industry revenue and should be shared more liberally with all
teams.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, according to one of the many charts in the report, the
Yankees received $175.94 million in local revenue. At the other end
were the Montreal Expos, with $11.97 million.
</P>
<P>
   The panel would take 40 to 50 percent of each club's local
revenue, put it into a pool and divide the pool evenly among the 30
teams. The existing plan has a two-tiered payout that benefits
clubs below the industry's average local revenue. The panel's plan
would remove that benefit from the poorer clubs and treat the
middle-level teams the same as those below them economically.
</P>
<P>
   A baseball lawyer said at least some baseball officials have
wanted to benefit middle-level clubs at the expense of the poorest
clubs and at the same time take a huge chunk of money from the
wealthiest teams.
</P>
<P>
   Although no panel member acknowledged knowing of any such desire
_ Mitchell said the recommendations were exclusively the panel's _
Levin talked about the benefits the middle teams could gain from
the revenue-sharing plan.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought a bottom-tier team would sign a free agent
passed up by a top-tier team because of the steep tax proposed, he
said: ``Yeah, or a team in the middle. I actually think it will be
a pronounced effect on midrange teams, second- and third-quartile
payroll teams, because I think they will now see their playoff
chances are going to be better if they invest in players. I think
that's where you'll see more bidders in the market for the talented
players.''
</P>
<P>
   And while most owners chose not to comment on a report they said
they had not yet read, Drayton McLane of the midlevel Houston
Astros said he was ``encouraged very much'' by the report.
</P>
<P>
   A person who attended the meeting said some representatives of
low-level teams grumbled about the suggestion of a minimum payroll.
But that grumbling does not figure to be any louder than the
behind-the-scenes outrage certain to be expressed by Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   A Yankees official said Steinbrenner would have no comment on
the report, but the owner is certain to make his feelings known to
Commissioner Bud Selig.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are expected to pay about $25 million in revenue
sharing this year under the existing formula. That sum would
escalate significantly under the proposed plan.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone efforts to reach Wilpon were unsuccessful, but the
Mets would be hit hard, too. They were second in local revenue last
year with $132.32 million.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed competitive-balance tax would also hit the Yankees.
If the proposed 50 percent tax were in effect this year, the
Yankees would have to pay about $16 million.
</P>
<P>
   The luxury tax that existed for the previous three years under
the 1996 labor agreement used a 35 percent and 34 percent rate and
a floating threshold determined by the average of the fifth and
sixth highest payrolls. That tax, which is not in effect this year,
``failed to moderate the rapid escalation of club payrolls,'' the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that only the Yankees ($64.5 million), the
Cleveland Indians ($45.92 million) and the Colorado Rockies ($12.44
million) were profitable operations over the past five years, 1995
through 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Giants, it said, were the biggest losers
($97.02 million).
</P>
<P>
   The panel was appointed by Selig and, unlike the last committee,
had no members selected by the players' union. Asked about the
report, Donald Fehr, the union head, said, ``We always get some
report like this before a negotiation.''
</P>
<P>
   The union is expected next month to exercise an option in the
current labor agreement to extend the contract until the end of the
2001 season.

RUSSIAN PUZZLE: WHAT DOES THE WAR ON TYCOONS MEAN? 
</HEADLINE>
   (CORRECTS name to ``Vladimir'' in 13th graf)  
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ No one outside the Kremlin is quite sure why, or what
it portends, or even whether it will last very long. But after nine
long years of fabulous high living and seeming immunity from the
rules that govern mere mortals, Russia's infamous tycoons have
suddenly found themselves marked men.
</P>
<P>
   At least, some have. Whether they continue to be targets will
say much about whether President Vladimir Putin's much-vaunted
``dictatorship of the law'' is in fact that or is more in the mold
of the last Kremlin, where the rich played by their own laws.
</P>
<P>
   In the last week, Russia's government has launched public
campaigns of legal and political pressure against the titans who
run five of the nation's most powerful business combines, including
the largest oil company, automaker, metals processor and power
utility.
</P>
<P>
   In short order, government agencies have lodged tax-evasion
charges against the No. 1 petroleum company, Lukoil, and the
automaker AvtoVAZ.
</P>
<P>
   They demanded in a letter that the tycoon who owns 38 percent of
Norilsk Nickel, a vast Siberian mining company, repay $140 million
supposedly shorted the government when the company was privatized
in the early 1990s. A similar complaint was filed against Tyumen
Oil, another big petroleum company, in late June.
</P>
<P>
   And Friday, the Russian parliament's Audit Chamber took aim at
the electricity monopoly RAO-UES, accusing it of illegally selling
a stake to foreigners when part of the state-owned company was
auctioned to the public in 1992. The chairman of RAO-UES is Anatoly
B. Chubais, who was former prime minister under President Boris
Yeltsin and who oversaw the early privatization of Russian
industry, including UES.
</P>
<P>
   Chubais is reviled by many average Russians as the symbol of
Russia's economic collapse. But he remains the godfather of
right-wing politics here and an icon of the very free-market
policies Putin has demanded that parliament enact this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Chubais called the accusations against RAO-UES unfounded
_ a ``red revanche'' led by parliament's communists, he said _ but
added that he was worried by their political implications.
</P>
<P>
   Whether founded or not, it would be hard to find in the gold
rush that was Russia's early transition to capitalism anyone who
did not play fast and loose with the few rules of the time.
</P>
<P>
   But the political implications of this new campaign have left
almost all scratching their heads. For it is hard to tell, yet,
whether the rash of attacks on the so-called oligarchs is the
payoff on Putin's longstanding pledge to apply the same laws to
both the tycoon and the kiosk operator, or the beginning of some
darker and more subtle bloodletting.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are looking for clarity on this,'' said Thomas Graham,
a former U.S. diplomat who is now a Russia scholar with the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``On one hand, everybody wants to see the thievery stopped,'' he
said Friday, ``and I think most people realize these oligarchs'
empires were built in an illicit fashion. But if it looks like this
is being politicized, it creates problems for investors in Russia
and for the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Politics has been high on most observers' minds since May, when
the first major attack was sprung against Vladimir Gusinsky and his
Media-Most empire, a collection of print and broadcast outlets that
are among the Kremlin's most influential critics.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two months, various government offices have staged
armed raids on Gusinsky's offices, seized a gun once awarded him by
Yeltsin, accused him of swindling the government in the sale of a
television station, and briefly jailed him in one of Moscow's most
notorious prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has chided his government for being overly enthusiastic in
its pursuit of Gusinsky, but he has otherwise been silent, leaving
the question of whether he has approved such assaults or is simply
tolerating them because he lacks the political power to call them
off.
</P>
<P>
   To some experts, the challenges are distinguished by two traits:
Many involve owners of powerful media companies, and none touch
those tycoons who are said to be closest to the Kremlin and the
people who made Putin president, the friends and relatives of
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Lukoil has extensive interests in newspapers and local
television. The power behind Norilsk Nickel, Vladimir Potanin, is
an investor in the national daily Izvestia. The man behind AvtoVAZ,
the much-maligned tycoon Boris Berezovsky, took control last year
of Russia most respected and powerful business newspaper,
Kommersant.
</P>
<P>
   Yet to feel the government's sting is Roman Abramovich, a
Yeltsin-family intimate whose Sibneft oil empire was formed from
one of the most notorious privatization schemes in the mid-1990s.
Nor has Putin's government been especially cooperative in
Switzerland's investigation of another Yeltsin family friend, Pavel
Borodin, who oversaw a Kremlin restoration project that has become
the object of a sprawling bribery and money-laundering
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   After Yeltsin resigned, Putin moved Borodin out of the Kremlin
to an honorific job as head of a body overseeing a slow-moving
economic union of Russia and Belarus.
</P>
<P>
   But there are other theories as to why the tycoons are suddenly
under assault. One is that the tycoons themselves are jockeying for
advantage in the new Putin government, using their remaining power
to muscle various state agencies into persecuting their rivals. By
that explanation, Putin is at least in part a bystander in a fight
that is not entirely under his control.
</P>
<P>
   Putin himself seems of two minds. In an interview Friday in
Izvestia, he said ``tax evasion and other abuses acquired a mass
scale and became routine'' in Russia's early years, and so it was
natural for those who benefited from the loose rules of the time to
oppose a crackdown now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many businessmen today have found themselves in the `zone of
risk,' in potentially difficult relations with the law,'' Putin
said. ``So, how can't they be but nervous?''
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, he said, ``businessmen are now trying to
settle scores with one another by using state structures and law
enforcement bodies.'' He added: ``An end should be put to this.
Otherwise, further damage will be inflicted by such actions.''
</P>
<P>
   One longtime political expert, Vyachaslav Nikonov, a former
member of parliament, said in an interview Friday that an internal
battle among the tycoons was a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   But it is equally likely, he suggested, that Putin has simply
given his government free rein to go after the tycoons, both for
political gain and for the immense riches that the tycoons control,
which the government would like to tap.
</P>
<P>
   And if that is not enough, he said, the Kremlin has an obvious
reason to soak the very richest Russians: The very poorest ones,
who vastly outnumber them at the polls, have been salivating at the
prospect for close to a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just popular,'' Nikonov said. ``It's absolutely perfect
politics. People in the streets are absolutely delighted with
this.''

EMPLOYEES HAVE RIGHT TO WITNESSES FOR MEETINGS WITH BOSSES, LABOR
BOARD SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal agency's ruling this week that any employee summoned
into a boss's office can take a fellow employee as a witness is
being derided by management lawyers and praised by labor advocates.
But both sides say the decision is unlikely to alter the dynamics
of the workplace immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1975, any union member called into a disciplinary meeting
has had the right to be accompanied by a co-worker. On Monday, the
National Labor Relations Board extended that right to all workers.
And the initial reaction from management ranks was dismay.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, where the rights were limited to 10 percent
of the work force, now they're 100 percent of the work force,''
said Randel Johnson, vice president for labor policy at the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce. Some employment lawyers say the ruling
represents a new tripwire for managers as they conduct the routine
business of running offices and factories: disciplining employees,
handing out performance evaluations, sorting out misunderstandings
and, of course, firing employees. Supervisors generally prefer to
handle such matters privately, but under the new ruling, any
employee who anticipates trouble is entitled to take along a
co-worker of his choice as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be very unworkable if every time you wanted to talk
to one of your employees, you had to get somebody to come into the
room and get involved in the conversation,'' said Thomas Walsh, a
partner at the law firm of Jackson Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   There are also concerns that the ruling could hamper employers
as they try to investigate embezzlement, sexual harassment and
other wrongdoing at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the hallmarks of a good investigation is whether the
company is able to keep it confidential,'' said Paul Salvatore, a
partner at the law firm of Proskauer Rose, which represents
managers in employment disputes. If the witness ``spreads the word
that they're investigating everybody in the department for theft,
that compromises the employer's investigation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For a decade, management lawyers have been counseling employers
to investigate sexual harassment assertions privately, to avoid
compounding such matters with accusations of managerial
insensitivity. Now, the lawyers are wondering how their clients
will be able to hold such discreet, one-on-one interviews if
accused gropers, say, are allowed to bring colleagues into the
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   They are also wondering about the practicalities of choosing
witnesses. In unionized workplaces, workers take their union
steward along when they expect a confrontation with a supervisor.
``Shop stewards can't object like a lawyer would, but they're able
to add some guidance because a unionized workplace is covered by
the collective bargaining agreement,'' Salvatore said. He added
that it was unclear who would fill this role in a nonunion
workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the concerns of management, advocates for workers say
the new ruling could be a plus for both sides. Steven Platt,
president of the National Employment Lawyers Association, whose
members represent employees, said the presence of a co-worker
during a dismissal might defuse some of the tension and rage that
now prompt some fired employees to come back with guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we see workplace violence, it usually happens because
people feel like they have no recourse,'' Platt said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for both sides said there would not be a wave of demands
for witnesses any time soon. Even under the ruling, employers will
not have to invite witnesses to meetings unless the employees ask
them to. And nonunion workers are not likely to be aware of their
right to do so. But if an employee does ask for a witness in a
meeting, the supervisor must agree.
</P>
<P>
   The case promting the labor board's decision involved the
Epilepsy Foundation of Northeast Ohio and two employees, Arnis
Borgs and Ashraful Hasan. Borgs and Hasan had a falling- out with
their supervisor and sent memorandums complaining about him to the
executive director of the nonprofit foundation. The executive
director was furious and demanded that Borgs meet with her and the
supervisor. Borgs, knowing that a reprimand was on the way, said he
wanted to take Hasan along. The director refused and later fired
Borgs, who then took the matter to the labor relations board.
</P>
<P>
   This was not the first time that the agency had been asked to
consider the issue. In 1982, it ruled essentially the same way it
ruled this week, that nonunion workers could take co-workers to
disciplinary meetings. But the composition of the board changed
over the course of the Reagan and Bush administrations, and the
board began to rule in subsequent cases that the right to a witness
was limited to union workers.
</P>
<P>
   Platt said the new ruling reflected the waning influence of two
Republican administrations and a shift in philosophy resulting from
eight years of Democratic appointments and financing decisions.
</P>
<P>
   In Cleveland, Steven Moss, a lawyer who represented the Epilepsy
Foundation, said he would appeal the ruling to federal circuit
court. Although the labor board ordered the foundation to give
Borgs and Hasan their jobs back, Moss said his client would not do
so until all legal remedies had been exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   Because the board was divided, with a three-member majority and
two strong dissents, the law is likely to change again, Moss said,
depending on which party wins the presidential election this fall.

ABRAHAM HORWITZ, 89; LED PAN AMERICAN HEALTH ORGANIZATION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Chile)  By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Abraham Horwitz, the director of the Pan American Health
Organization from 1958 to 1975, died on Monday at his home in
Washington. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   Horwitz led the health organization through a period of
political, social and technological change. He also was chairman of
the committee on international nutrition programs of the National
Academy of Sciences from 1978 to 1986 and was chairman of a U.N.
nutrition panel from 1986 until five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   At his death, Horwitz, an expert on vitamin A deficiency, headed
an international consulting group on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``The persistence of vitamin A deficiency anywhere in the world
is cruel because it exposes mothers and children to great risks,''
Horwitz said, according to the Pan American Health Organization.
``It is immoral because it ignores basic human values; and it is
unacceptable because it is preventable.''
</P>
<P>
   Vitamin A is in foods like egg yolks, butter and carrots.
Deficiencies can lead to night blindness and serious illness.
</P>
<P>
   Horwitz, who was born in Santiago, Chile, also was chairman of
the Pan American Health and Education Foundation, for which he
created a program to supply medical students in Latin American and
the Caribbean with textbooks and instruments.
</P>
<P>
   He earned his medical degree at the University of Chile in 1936,
focusing on communicable diseases and public health. He came to the
United States to work as a Rockefeller Foundation fellow on
infectious diseases in the early 1940s and earned a master's degree
in public health at Johns Hopkins University in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   He then was named a professor at the University of Chile,
directed its School of Public Health, and began his work with the
Pan American Health Organization, an affiliate of the World Health
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Chile reclaimed him to help reorganize its national health
service in the 1950s. He was elected director of the
Washington-based Pan American Health Organization in 1958, and
served four terms.
</P>
<P>
   He published many papers on epidemiology, communicable diseases
and preventive medicine, and on education in health, nutrition and
public health administration.
</P>
<P>
   His contributions were widely recognized in Latin America, the
Caribbean and the United States, and he won numerous awards.
</P>
<P>
   Horwitz's survivors include his wife, Cecilia, and five
stepchildren.

BUSH AND N.Y. SENATE CANDIDATE LAZIO APPEAR TOGETHER, CALL FOR
MISSILE DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas flew to New York Friday
to offer his support for Rep. Rick Lazio's bid for the U.S. Senate,
belittling Hillary Rodham Clinton with a familiar critique before
an audience of Conservative Party donors in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see, he's from here,'' Bush said of Lazio, a sarcastic
edge to his voice. ``This is his state. He knows New York well. He
also doesn't have to wear a Yankee cap to play like he's a Yankee
fan.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time that Bush, the likely Republican
presidential candidate, had campaigned along side Lazio since Lazio
was chosen to run against Clinton. Lazio, a Suffolk County
Republican, and Bush used their back-to-back appearances to praise
each other's records and credentials, and Lazio used his first
joint appearance with his party's presumed presidential nominee to
state his support for an anti-missile defense shield that Bush
backs.
</P>
<P>
   In another speech, New York Gov. George Pataki praised Bush's
conservative ideals.
</P>
<P>
   Both Lazio and Bush were restrained in their comments about
Clinton and the Senate race in New York, in what appeared to be an
attempt not to draw too much attention to their joint appearance
before a Conservative Party fund-raiser. The event posed a
complication to Lazio's candidacy because Clinton has recently
sought to tie Lazio to Bush, and repeatedly challenged Lazio's
attempt to portray himself as a moderate Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even before Lazio followed Bush into the ballroom at the
Sheraton New York Hotel in Midtown, Clinton, at an early-morning
news conference on Long Island, was assailing Lazio for taking
Conservative Party support and appearing at its fund-raising
luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to its Web site, Clinton ran through the party's
positions on several issues, including school vouchers and abortion
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opponent has some questions to answer about his being a
Republican-Conservative candidate, about his commitment to issues
that he claims to support and about his record,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The joint appearance of Bush and Lazio came during one of Bush's
rare trips to New York. Although Bush said Friday that he believed
he can win New York state against Vice President Al Gore in
November, many Republicans and Democrats in the state have said
they consider that unlikely, given the Democratic registration edge
in New York. For the same reason, Lazio probably does not stand to
gain much politically by campaigning with Bush, who he addressed as
Buddy in his speech.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's remarks about Clinton's residency may be the latest
indication of the extent to which her opponents believe a
carpetbagger attack is effective against her. The host of the
luncheon, Michael Long, the chairman of the state Conservative
Party, drew laughs and cheers when he said, ``I admit sometimes
when I hear people arguing about the horrible foreign menace that
has suddenly appeared in New York, I don't know if they're talking
about the West Nile virus or Hillary Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio returned to the same theme, if in a more subtle way, with
his own speech a few moments later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make this promise to you: I will be a senator from New York
and for New York,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio devoted most of his speech to talking, not about Clinton,
but about the need for an missile defense shield.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a dangerous world, ladies and gentlemen,'' Lazio
said. ``We have enemies. And the technology for mass destruction is
spreading. My friends, I'm proud to announce today that I will be
working with Gov. Bush to make sure that we implement an effective
missile defense system for America.''
</P>
<P>
   And Bush devoted only a small part of his speech to Lazio and
his race with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I like about Rick is that he is a decisive person,''
Bush said. ``When he made up his mind to run, he entered the race.
He didn't need a listening tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio had deferred his campaign for Senate last year at the
request of party leaders who wanted Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to be
their candidate. When Giuliani abruptly withdrew in the spring
because of health reasons, Lazio eagerly hopped into the race.

 &HT;    MUTINY AT BOOT CAMP FOR KIDS RAISES QUESTIONS(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By DENNIS WAGNER(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Your story goes here.
</P>
<P>
   Did some troubled kids mutiny at a juvenile boot camp on the
White Mountain Apache Reservation or were they victims of abuse?
</P>
<P>
   Criminal investigators, tribal authorities, social workers and
families are still trying to sort out the mess in Whiteriver, where
a group known as America's Buffalo Soldiers Re-enactors Association
conducts a camp for wayward youths.
</P>
<P>
   This much is undisputed: The Phoenix-based organization runs a
strict program for children ages 7 to 17, most of whom were
enrolled by their parents. The Summer Endurance Youth Camp regimen
includes forced marches, black uniforms, in-your-face discipline
and a daily diet limited to an apple for breakfast, a carrot for
lunch and a bowl of beans for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-three juveniles, about half of them Apaches, attended the
program. On Tuesday, some of the youths reported that they had been
kicked, choked and subjected to other cruelty by drill instructors.
They also told of being handcuffed together.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said no juveniles were injured, and no arrests have
been made.
</P>
<P>
   The White Mountain Tribal Council voted to close the operation
Tuesday, but rescinded that order a day later after hearing from
Buffalo Soldiers administrators and supporters. By Friday, nearly
half the boys and girls had left the program.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Charles Long II, founder and president of the Buffalo
Soldiers, has not responded to interview requests.
</P>
<P>
   Grateful Jones, a sergeant in the organization, said the
controversy was created by a group of boys who made death threats
against camp leaders and concocted stories of mistreatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no abuse going on up there,'' Jones said. ``These kids
all plotted to get their stories together. (They) have their own
rap sheets. It's not as if they're angels.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones emphasized that the program deals with hard-core kids who
benefit from a ``no-nonsense'' approach. In addition to exercise,
camp leaders use drama therapy, history lessons and bonding
methods. Parents, who pay $4,250 for the 35-day camp, sign papers
consenting to the methods.
</P>
<P>
   A photograph on the Buffalo Soldiers Web site shows boys bound
together and being led on a march with their hands tied and with
bags over their heads. The exercise, according to the Web site, is
designed to ``discourage runaways and deepen the group cohesion and
trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said one boy was punished beneath a legendary hanging tree
where a rope dangled from a branch, but she denied a report that
the noose was around the youth's neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid spit in the colonel's face and called him a (racial
epithet),'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said a few boys started the trouble by persuading Apache
children to run away and make claims of mistreatment. More than
half the youngsters remain in the camp, and some parents lend vocal
support for the Buffalo Soldiers and Long.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program has kept many children out of jail, and my son is
one of them,'' said Harriet Fontenot, a Glendale teacher whose
16-year-old twins have participated for more than two years.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Silver, who also put two children through Long's camps,
said, ``He's tough as nails with them, but he's fair. It's tough
love.''
</P>
<P>
   Long founded the Buffalo Soldiers 10 years ago as a historical
re-enactment group based on African-American cavalrymen who served
in the Army 120 years ago, mostly as Indian fighters. The
association initially focused on education and film productions,
but also developed a branch involved with youth rehabilitation. It
also conducts boot camps for Roosevelt School District and at a
camp near Cave Creek.

ANALYSIS: CONFERENCE MARKS TURNING POINT IN GLOBAL RESPONSE
TO  AIDS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SABIN RUSSELL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa _ It won't make a mark as a very important
gathering of scientific minds, but the 13th International AIDS
Conference that closed here Friday may well be remembered as a
historic turning point in the global response to the 20 year-old
plague.
</P>
<P>
   For unlike previous international AIDS conferences, this one was
infused from the start by deeply divisive political issues that put
the spotlight on the differences between have and have-not nations,
continents and cultures.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first such meeting ever to take place in Africa, and
for this reason alone it accomplished its purpose. For one week,
the world's attention was focused on the enormity of human
suffering that has and will come down on this troubled continent,
where nearly 25 million of the world's 34 million HIV-infected
reside.
</P>
<P>
   And like a hero warrior who has at last heard the cries for
help, Nelson Mandela himself _ perhaps the most admired world
figures alive today _ belatedly but decisively became engaged in
his country and Africa's plight.
</P>
<P>
   His call during his closing ceremony address for an immediate
and grand-scale campaign to save the continent was a challenge to
his own government, to neighboring African states and to the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is, as I understand it, a gathering of human beings
concerned about turning around one of the greatest threats
humankind has faced, and certainly the greatest after the end of
the great wars of the previous century,'' the former South African
president said.
</P>
<P>
   ``AIDS is clearly a disaster, effectively wiping out the
development gains of the past decades and sabotaging the future.
Something must be done as a matter of the greatest urgency.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a far cry from the lackluster response of the South
African government, including Mandela's own administration. The
leadership has ignored and trivialized the AIDS threat, even as it
grew to the point where 1 in 5 adults is believed to be infected
with the virus, for which there are costly treatments, but still no
cure.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela ended on a high note a meeting that began with president
Thabo Mbeki's reiteration of his own skepticism about the nature of
the epidemic, and his insistence that there is nothing about this
disease that eradication of poverty would not cure.
</P>
<P>
   The anger many of the 12,000 conference delegates felt toward
Mbeki was transformed by the inspiring keynote address by Justice
Edwin Cameron, a high court judge who is gay, white and
HIV-positive. He explained how he was able to ``pay for life
itself'' by purchasing antiviral drugs, and he demanded that his
poor, black fellow countrymen be afforded the same opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``My presence here embodies the injustice of AIDS in Africa
because, on a continent in which 290 million Africans survive on
less than $1 a day, I can afford monthly medication costs of about
$400 per month,'' the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron's address set a high moral tone for the remainder of the
week, and assured that the questions of access would dominate
discussions. Demonstrators badgered drug company representatives
and called on developing nations to sidestep patents and import
cheaper, generic forms of the AIDS drugs otherwise so costly they
were beyond the reach of their people.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of AIDS15 (106277 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  The challenge laid down by treatment access advocates applied to
the scientists reporting the latest findings of their own research.
``The development of new drugs does not mean anything without a
discussion of how the broader community will get access to them,''
said Mandeep Dahliwal, a Ugandan lawyer who runs an AIDS service
organization in Kampala.
</P>
<P>
   Dahliwal was one of dozens of female African women  &LR; leaders,
whose high profile at the conference underscored one of its
lessons: that the heterosexual epidemic decimating Africa is
disproportionately afflicting women, who are being infected and
dying in greater numbers, and at a younger age than their male
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of powerful female voices assured that the
sensitive issues of male violence against women, and the
subservient role of women in many African societies, would be
openly discussed at the conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that the customs and practices associated with male
and female roles and sexuality in many societies today are
compromising the rights and freedoms of individuals and promoting a
cycle of illness and death. This must stop,'' said Geeta Rao Gupta,
president of the Washington, D.C.-based International Center for
Research on Women, during a plenary address.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be no more powerful reason for change _ gender roles
that disempower women and give men a false sense of power are
killing our youth and women and men in their most productive years.
This must change. That is the message that must be communicated _
without any caveats, ifs, or buts.''
</P>
<P>
   In the scientific forums, one of the most disappointing moments
was the disclosure that a commonly available contraceptive gel used
as a microbicide to kill the AIDS virus actually increased HIV
infection rates among prostitutes. This was a set-back for women's
rights advocates, who are desperately seeking ``women controlled''
methods of HIV protection.
</P>
<P>
   But there was good news, too. Trials of short courses of an
inexpensive antiviral drug, nevirapine, seemed to prove that there
is an affordable way to cut in half the number of babies who would
contract the AIDS virus from their HIV positive mothers in the
birth canal.
</P>
<P>
   Studies showed that AIDS prevention efforts such as providing
HIV tests are both affordable and effective means of getting people
to practice safer sex. ``People who know their HIV status change
their behavior,'' said Tom Coates, director of the University of
California at San Francisco AIDS Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Reports on drug research touched on many themes. Studies showed
that low-cost treatments with broad-spectrum antibiotics such as
Bactrim could be used in African settings to improve the health of
HIV-infected men, women and children. Efforts to find new
antivirals turned up promising results for ``fusion inhibitors,'' a
new class of antiviral drug that targets a different mechanism of
the AIDS virus than two other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   There was universal belief that the ultimate solution to the
world AIDS crisis is a vaccine. And for the first time, there was
enough good news on vaccine research that the topic was placed on
the agenda of the international conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the start of the epidemic, no one knew enough about the
virus or immunology to know even what questions to ask,'' said Dr.
Margaret Liu, vice president of vaccine research at Emerville-based
Chiron, addressing a plenary session.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of AIDS15 (106277 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Today, however, immunization research is highly focused. Numerous
approaches are being studied and all are yielding promising
candidate vaccines. Liu would not predict that the world would meet
President Clinton's goal of an effective AIDS vaccine by 2007, but
she said it is clearly within reach.
</P>
<P>
   The contrasting worlds of high-power pharmaceutical research and
village-level community health care were ever present at the Durban
conference. This coastal resort and shipping port embodies the
contradictory worlds of South Africa, which is both a wealthy
industrial power and an impoverished developing nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You meet in a country to whose citizens freedom and democracy
are but very new gifts,'' President Mbeki reminded delegates. ``For
us, freedom and democracy are only 6 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco General Hospital AIDS clinician Dr. Donald Abrams
marveled at the contrasts of Durban itself. ``You look around, and
it could be Southern California,'' he said at the modern
International Conference Center, surrounded by glass-walled luxury
hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Yet only hours before, Abrams had visited Mariannhill Hospital,
serving the HIV-infected population of the tin-roofed shantytowns
that dot the countryside outside of Durban. Here, the wards are
full of the gaunt, skeletal casualties of HIV, just like it used to
be in the worst days of the epidemic at San Francisco General.
</P>
<P>
   This young and restless democracy, a study in contrasts, is the
place where the culture of the modern industrial state meets the
culture of the Third World. It is a tumultuous, fascinating,
frustrating and inspiring place. There were many researchers who
frankly did not want to come here, either to protest the views of
Mbeki or out of concern for personal safety. Yet this week showed
that both cultures have common ground, as they do in this very
city, and will continue to when all the delegates leave.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stefano Vella, president of the International AIDS Society,
which put on the $10 million conference and will sponsor another
one in Barcelona in 2002, said that those who stayed home made a
mistake. ``This was a conference we should have brought our
children to,'' he said. ``We need to teach a new generation how to
fight AIDS.''

KEITH HIGHET, 67, DIES; PRACTICED INTERNATIONAL LAW FOR 40 YEARS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Mass., D.C.)  By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Keith Highet, a lawyer who handled more cases before the
International Court of Justice at The Hague than any other U.S.
lawyer, died Wednesday at his home in Washington. He was 67.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was complications from esophageal cancer,
said his wife, Margel Lindzey Highet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He must have handled at least 15 cases before the
International Court of Justice, and always with great scholarship,
insight and legal flair,'' said Stephen M. Schwebel, a former judge
and president of the International Court of Justice, who retired
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Highet began his 40-year career in international law as counsel
to Liberia and Ethiopia, which argued before the international
court beginning in 1963 that South Africa's policy of apartheid
violated its 1920 League of Nations mandate to administer the
former German colony of South-West Africa, now known as Namibia.
</P>
<P>
   After several years, the case was lost, but it persuaded Highet
to devote his professional life to international law.
</P>
<P>
   Until his death, Highet was in the thick of international
disputes. He had acted as adviser to the government of Peru in
resolving its border conflict with Ecuador, a dispute that had
several times erupted into armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
   After the fall of the government of Ferdinand Marcos in the
Philippines, he was chairman of the panel of legal experts of
President Corazon Aquino's Commission on Good Government.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his death, Highet was serving as counsel to the
government of Indonesia and the Republic of Cameroon in cases
pending before the international court.
</P>
<P>
   He was also adviser to the Azerbaijan State Oil Co. on the
division of the Caspian Sea and its oil resources. This year, he
was a member of the Committee of International Law Experts
appointed to advise the prime minister of the Federation of Bosnia
and Herzegovina on fighting corruption in that country.
</P>
<P>
   Although Highet mainly kept out of the public eye, in 1986 he
was a leader of a group of 40 international law experts who
publicly deplored the decision of the Reagan administration to
withdraw from the general compulsory jurisdiction of the
International Court of Justice; compulsory jurisdiction means that
a country submitting a matter to the court agrees to abide by its
decision.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to The New York Times, Highet and Anthony A.
D'Amato, a professor of law at Northwestern University, argued that
the United States ``should re-establish its long-standing
commitment to international law and the peaceful settlement of
international disputes by carefully considering the adoption of a
new or amended instrument of general adherence to the World Court's
compulsory jurisdiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Born on May 20, 1933, in Oxford, England, Gilbert Keith MacInnes
Highet was the son of Gilbert Highet, a well-known professor of
Latin language and literature at Columbia University, and Helen
MacInnes, the author of spy novels including ``Above Suspicion,''
and ``The Venician Affair.''
</P>
<P>
   Highet earned a bachelor's degree magna cum laude from Harvard
in 1954 and then entered the Marine Corps. After his discharge, he
was a Fulbright Fellow, studying at Balliol College at Oxford
University, and then earned a degree from the Harvard Law School in
1960.
</P>
<P>
   Highet later taught international law at the Fletcher School of
Law and Diplomacy, the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced
International Studies, the University of Paris, the George
Washington School of Law and the Ghana School of Law in Accra.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote chapters in 13 books on international law and more than
30 articles.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Highet is survived by his children, Ian
Douglas Highet of New York City, Eliot Highet Patty of South Salem,
N.Y., and Mary Marshall Highet of Edgartown, Mass.; and two
grandchildren.

EDITORIAL: A SOLID REPUBLICAN DRUG PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, July 15:
</P>
<P>
   William Roth, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, rattled
his fellow Republicans this week by offering a plan to add
prescription drugs to Medicare that resembles proposals by
congressional Democrats and the White House. The Roth plan
repudiates the ill-conceived Republican bill that passed the House
and provides a plausible platform for a bipartisan agreement _
though probably not before the elections.
</P>
<P>
   Under the House bill, only private insurers would offer coverage
to the elderly. But even some private insurers regard the bill as
unworkable. Roth concedes as much by proposing instead a plan that
would have the government, as well as private plans, offer drug
coverage. Roth's bill goes far beyond offering a drug benefit,
however, embracing a reform for the entire Medicare program that
mirrors proposals by President Clinton, a majority of the
bipartisan congressional committee on Medicare reform and a wide
swath of health experts.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of a drug benefit is only one of Medicare's
problems. In the last few weeks, for example, many private
managed-care plans have dropped out of the program in some regions,
leaving enrollees to scramble for new coverage. The reason, they
say, is that government reimbursement for covering the elderly is
too low for them to survive. The simple truth is that under the
current rules the government cannot possibly know how much it needs
to pay plans to keep them active participants.
</P>
<P>
   Roth proposes major revisions. The government would continue to
offer existing Medicare coverage, as well as offer a second option
that would be expanded to include coverage of drugs. Managed-care
plans would be invited as well to offer the same two options. For
each enrollee, the government would pay the managed-care plans an
amount approximately equal to the cost per person of its
fee-for-service coverage. Managed-care plans that could offer the
same benefits for less cost would be allowed to offer their
customers rebates.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to harness market-driven competition to force plans
to provide innovative care and hold down costs. Like the Clinton
plan, the Roth formulation would not need to raise premiums in the
government-run fee-for-service plan faster than planned under
current law except to cover the cost of additional drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   There are flaws in the Roth plan, but they are remediable.
Enrollees in the government plan who decide to buy the new drug
coverage would pay more for home health care and some other
benefits. That threatens to fragment the insurance market, driving
people into or out of drug coverage based on their expected needs
for home health care and other benefits. Also, the drug policy that
Roth appears to have in mind would be far less generous than what
Democrats have proposed and what the elderly need. But to correct
these and the other flaws requires only the commitment to spend
more money. No structural redesign is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats attribute Roth's decision to side with them to
his need to firm up support for his re-election bid in Delaware.
Perhaps. But whatever the motive, Roth has offered an attractive
plan for giving reliable, affordable drug coverage to the elderly
as part of a vastly improved overall Medicare program.

 SENATE VOTES TO ABOLISH TAX ON INHERITANCES  &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With support from key Democrats _ including
California's Dianne Feinstein _ the Senate voted to repeal the
inheritance tax Friday, signaling a seismic shift in political
attitudes about wealth in America.
</P>
<P>
   Although President Clinton again promised to veto the measure
Friday, the 59-to-31 vote for repeal included backing from nine
Democrats. A similar measure, which was passed overwhelmingly by
the House last month, picked up support from nearly half of
California's Democratic delegation, including Walnut Creek's Ellen
Tauscher and Silicon Valley's Anna Eshoo and Zoe Lofgren.
</P>
<P>
   The repeal would phase out the current inheritance tax, which
applies to estates of more than $675,000, over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   A Clinton veto would make the inheritance tax an instant
election year issue. Vice President Al Gore, the presumptive
Democratic nominee, opposes repeal, while George W. Bush, his
Republican challenger, favors it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton denounced the repeal as irresponsible, calling it ``a
budget-busting bill that provides a huge tax cut for the most
well-off Americans at the expense of working families.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a sign of how far sentiment has swung against the estate
tax _ derided by opponents as the ``death tax'' _ Clinton and other
Democrats scrambled to propose their own relief plan, offering rate
reductions and exemptions for the farmers and small business people
who have been the biggest opponents of the estate tax.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans rebuffed Clinton's alternatives, declaring that
nothing but repeal will do.
</P>
<P>
   Americans ``know double taxation when they see it,'' said Rep.
Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark. ``They know that if they've paid income tax,
they've paid capital gains tax, they've paid sales tax, that it's
absolutely fundamentally, inherently wrong to make death another
taxable event.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans insisted that even though only about 2 percent of
Americans who die each year leave an estate large enough to be
taxed, the tax is inherently unjust.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a very basic and fundamental level, I believe that the
estate tax is unfair,'' Feinstein said in a statement. ``It amounts
to double taxation, taxing _ at times at a confiscatory rate in
excess of 50 percent _ assets that were already taxed when the
income was earned.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein is among the wealthiest members of the Senate. She and
her husband, Richard Blum, reported assets of at least $27 million
in her most recent financial disclosure statement. But she said it
was constituents who convinced her to support repeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a family works for years to establish and grow a business
or farm, an heir should not be forced to sell the business or farm
simply to pay taxes on it,'' she said. ``That is not fair, not
right and not what the American dream is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing soaring California real estate prices, Feinstein said the
tax is threatening many middle class people who were never intended
as its targets. She warned that her vote signals ``that the ball is
now in the administration's court'' to come up with a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The estate tax, first enacted in 1916 during the Progressive
Party era, now tops out at 55 percent, with a 5 percent surcharge
on especially large estates. The tax exempts the first $675,000 of
an inheritance per person, or $1.35 million for a couple, with that
exemption set to rise to $1 million per person and $2 million per
couple in 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Becker, who with his wife owns Beckers' by the Beach, a
grocery store in Stinson Beach, said the combination of a home and
a small business in high-priced real estate markets such as the Bay
Area can easily force heirs to sell the property to pay the taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking about the Bill Gateses of the world,''
Becker said. ``If you come to Stinson Beach and you walk down the
main street, you'll see a surf shop, a real estate company, a
restaurant or two. You'll see my grocery store, a video store _
these are all operated by the people who own them. These are their
livelihoods.''
</P>
<P>
   The estate tax was long been supported on fairness grounds, as a
way to prevent an aristocracy of inherited wealth. Democrats have
traditionally denounced efforts to reduce it as a GOP giveaway to
the rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is it that Republicans are so prepared to protect the
financial interests of the wealthiest individuals?'' asked Sen.
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sign of the growing shift against the tax, Kennedy was
careful to acknowledge ``the legitimate concerns'' of small
businesspeople and farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, California Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer said, ``There
are some inequities we can fix and that we should fix, that deal
with family farms and smaller businesses and individuals. But to
repeal the entire estate tax is helping those at the very top of
the ladder.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have proposed estate tax reductions that would have
been unthinkable for the party just two years ago and that some tax
experts say would provide faster and more certain relief than the
GOP's 10-year phase-in of repeal.
</P>
<P>
   The House Democratic version would have quickly slashed rates by
20 percent, and the Senate version would have raised the personal
exemption to $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Rising sentiment against the tax has been fueled by
small-business lobbies that have assiduously broadened their
coalition, attracting the National Association of Women Business
Owners, the National Black Chamber of Commerce and the U.S.
Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, increasing stock ownership and soaring real estate
prices have made people wealthier and their assets more likely to
fall under the inheritance tax, especially as the parents of the
vast Baby Boom generation begin to die.
</P>
<P>
   Estate tax repeal is part of this year's GOP strategy of passing
the most popular elements of the $792 billion tax package that
Clinton vetoed last year.
</P>
<P>
   With the Treasury awash in surplus revenue _ projected now at
$1.87 trillion by 2010, not counting excess Social Security payroll
taxes _ Republicans argue that the time is ripe for tax cuts, and
they are finding significant Democratic support.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than simply opposing GOP tax cuts, the White House is
countering with offers to accept ``reasonable'' tax cuts if
Republicans support some of Clinton's key proposals, like a
Medicare drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   But the political dynamics of the approaching election undermine
the chances for any such grand compromise. With both the White
House and the House up for grabs, both parties are concentrating
more on collecting political ammunition for November than enacting
legislation.

EDITORIAL: CRUELTY-FREE DIAMONDS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, July 15:
</P>
<P>
   Sunday in Antwerp, the World Diamond Congress will meet to write
new rules for the treatment of diamonds from war zones. Diamond
traders and manufacturers are reacting to public concern about
diamonds mined illicitly by warlords in Angola, Sierra Leone and
Congo to finance wars fought largely for control of their country's
mineral wealth. The industry, realizing that bad publicity could
devalue a product whose only worth comes from consumer perception,
is eager to certify that it sells only clean stones.
</P>
<P>
   An effective certification system, however, requires independent
monitoring, which the industry has so far resisted.
</P>
<P>
   The diamond controversy began in Angola. When the United States
cut off its Cold War aid to the rebel leader Jonas Savimbi, he
turned to diamonds. Since 1992 at least $2.5 billion in diamonds
have emerged from territory Savimbi controlled, the majority
purchased eventually by De Beers, the diamond giant, which had a
policy of buying and hoarding excess diamonds to keep the price up.
De Beers denies that it bought diamonds from the rebels knowingly,
but few experts believe this.
</P>
<P>
   Angola's diamonds have extended a war that has killed half a
million people in the last decade and made the country one of the
world's most miserable. Diamonds also finance a vicious rebel
movement in Sierra Leone and a war in Congo that has drawn in
countries from across the continent.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has led an international effort to curtail
the trade in diamonds from areas convulsed by war. In 1998, the
Security Council banned the purchase of Savimbi's diamonds,
although the embargo was widely violated. Last March, the Security
Council published a surprisingly strong report that accused several
African leaders of sanctions-busting and said that the central
diamond clearinghouse in Antwerp _ the world's largest market for
rough diamonds _ had ``extremely lax controls.'' Recently, the
Security Council banned the purchase of diamonds from Sierra Leone.
Global Witness, a London nongovernment group, has also been
important in raising public concern about conflict diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   In March, De Beers said it would guarantee that its diamonds did
not originate in war zones. This week it told its 125 major trading
partners that they had to do the same, or lose De Beers' business.
This shift is part of De Beers' overall attempt to rescue its
sinking profits. Its diamond stockpile is now seen as a drain of
its capital, and De Beers faces increased competition. It will stop
hoarding diamonds and try to become known as a brand name for clean
diamonds. The announcement will also keep trading partners from
working with the competition.
</P>
<P>
   The diamond industry plans to follow De Beers' lead, setting
rules that would establish a paper trail accompanying diamonds from
the mine onward. Legitimate exporters like South Africa and
Botswana are particularly enthusiastic about reform.
</P>
<P>
   But a certification system will not be effective unless
governments pass the necessary laws, prosecute sanctions-busters
and solve technical challenges like preventing certificate forgery.
This is likely to happen, but the industry so far has resisted the
important step of having independent experts monitor the
certification process.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other industries accused of bad global citizenship, the
diamond trade has been quick to decide that reform can serve its
members' interest. But the industry is secretive and insular, and
members have lied in the past about traffic in diamonds from war
zones. Their embrace of new rules is welcome, but should not be
trusted without verification.

 ELEVEN LEGISLATORS ASK CLINTON TO QUIT BOY SCOUTS POST  &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Eleven members of Congress have signed a letter
asking President Clinton to resign as the honorary head of the Boy
Scouts of America now that the Supreme Court has upheld the
organization's legal right to ban homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   The request, supported by several Bay Area Democrats, puts
Clinton in the prickly political position of either renouncing an
organization that has symbolized patriotism and wholesomeness for
nearly a century or turning his back on allies in the fight against
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The White House had no immediate response to the letter Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said Clinton does not agree with the Boy Scouts' practice
of excluding what the group calls ``avowed homosexuals.'' At the
same time, they provided no indication that he is giving serious
thought to abdicating his honorary title, which has been granted to
every president since William Howard Taft.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent to Clinton Thursday, Petaluma Democrat Lynn
Woolsey called the Boy Scouts' policy on gays ``unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to disavow this policy of intolerance, as well as to
clarify any misperception of implicit presidential approval, we
urge you, the leader of our nation, to resign as the honorary head
of the BSA (Boy Scouts of America),'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   It was signed by Woolsey and 10 other Democrats who have worked
closely with Clinton in the past, including Reps. Nancy Pelosi of
San Francisco, Barbara Lee of Oakland and George Miller of
Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Few organizations are held in higher political regard than the
Boy Scouts, a group that boasts 6.2 million members and 100 million
alumni. Among their alumni are 66 U.S. senators and 209 members of
the House of Representatives. In fact, three of those who signed
the letter _ Miller, and Reps. Barney Frank, D-Mass., and Bob
Filner, D-Calif. _ were Boy Scouts in their youth.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the Supreme Court struck down a New Jersey law
that required the Scouts to include gays as leaders and members. In
a 5-to-4 decision, the court ruled that such a law violates the
group's First Amendment rights of ``expressive association,'' the
right of a group to choose members who share an ideology or a set
of values.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of GAYS14 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  The Scouts had testified, during the years of litigation that led
to the decision, that being an ``avowed homosexual'' is
inconsistent with the Scout Oath, which requires members to strive
to be ``morally straight.''
</P>
<P>
   The House members did not take issue with the court decision,
but noted that ``we still believe intolerance is unacceptable and
that the federal government should not condone, play a role in or
be a partner to this policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's role with the Boy Scouts is largely symbolic. His
signature appears on certificates given to boys when they qualify
as Eagle Scouts, and he is invited to speak at the group's
quadrennial ``jamboree.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton last addressed the Boy Scouts in 1997 in Bowling Green,
Va., noting that since 1910, ``every president has proudly served
as your honorary president.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every president has recognized what a great contribution
Scouting has made and is making to the character of our young
people, and therefore to the character and future of the United
States of America,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics contend that such statements are inconsistent with
Clinton's opposition to discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``For him to associate himself with the Scouts really
contradicts everything he has ever stood for,'' said Scott Cozza, a
former Petaluma troop master.
</P>
<P>
   Cozza _ who said he was ousted as a troop leader after his
position on accepting gays became known _ and his teenage son
founded an organization known as Scouting for All, which is
dedicated to getting the Boy Scouts to rescind its policies on
gays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that the Boy Scouts have been outed as a bigoted
organization,'' Cozza said, ``Clinton definitely has to relinquish
his honorary postion. He's supposed to be a voice for human rights
and people who have been discriminated against.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House referred reporters to comments made by Clinton
shortly after the Supreme Court decision two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of GAYS14 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Asked during a news conference how he could justify his role as
honorary president of the Scouts, Clinton said, ``I'm generally
against discrimination against gays.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on to say that he is proud of the nation's efforts to
end discrimination in other areas, adding: ``The Boy Scouts still
are _ they're a great group, they do a lot of good.''
</P>
<P>
   Boy Scout officials say the controversy has had little effect on
their organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had tremendous support both before and after the
decision,'' said Boy Scouts' spokesman Greg Shields from the
group's headquarters in Texas. ``Boy Scouts is a voluntary
organization. We respect everyone's opinion and right to hold an
opinion. We simply ask other people to respect our right to hold
opinions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Scouts do not inquire as to their members' sexuality, nor do
they automatically dismiss gays. However they reserve that right,
stating in their organization's Web page: ``We believe an avowed
homosexual is not a role model for the values espoused in the Scout
Oath and Law.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to calling on the Clinton to abdicate his honorary
title, Woolsey plans to introduce legislation next week that would
revoke the organization's 84-year-old congressional charter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scouting should help boys grow and learn how to be leaders and
good citizens,'' said Woolsey. ``But intolerance is not a value we
want our children to learn, and it's not a value that the president
of the United States should support.''

A FEW CLOSE BRUSHES, BUT CLEMENS KEEPS HIS COOL INTACT
</HEADLINE>
  By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Preston Wilson flung both hands into the air, raised
onto his toes and jumped back from a fastball thrown by Roger
Clemens in the first inning Friday night, and there must have been
a sense of relief in the Yankees' dugout.
</P>
<P>
   It was Clemens' first start since he beaned the Mets' Mike
Piazza and was accused of doing so intentionally, and some of his
teammates _ and manager Joe Torre _ were not sure how he would
react, if Clemens would become tentative, for fear that he might
hit somebody again and raise more allegations.
</P>
<P>
   But Clemens brushed back Wilson in the first inning, pitched
inside a few more times and pitched effectively, allowing only two
runs over seven innings and earning his third victory in his last
three starts as the New York Yankees dumped the Florida Marlins,
6-2, before 35,332 fans at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw a few inside,'' Torre said. ``I'm not sure he was as
aggressive as he was, or wanted to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams and David Justice slammed back-to-back home runs
in the first inning, and in the fourth, Ryan Thompson ripped a
three-run homer, extending his audition to become the Yankees'
regular left fielder, at least for another day or two.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens strolled into the Yankees' clubhouse about two hours
before Friday night's game dressed in black slacks, one of his
primary wardrobe colors, with a Western-style belt, a dark blue
shirt and a beard one or two days' old, a major league pitcher
disguised as John Wayne. He is not the type to reveal his feelings.
</P>
<P>
   But Torre indicated obliquely that he sensed Clemens was hurt by
the fallout of the pitch he threw to Piazza _ the direct
accusations made by Piazza and some of the other Mets, as well as
some reporters.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the reaction, on Sunday night at Shea Stadium,
Torre saw Clemens sitting in the Yankees' training room and asked
him how he was holding up, and Clemens answered that he was OK
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was no way of knowing how Clemens would react until
he pitched again. Torre and the pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre had
encouraged him for more than a year, since he joined the Yankees,
to be more aggressive pitching inside, and Clemens had done so in
his first two starts in July and won.
</P>
<P>
   That was before the Piazza fallout, though. Clemens went to the
bullpen about 15 minutes sooner than he normally does, before
pitching against the Marlins Friday night _ he was anxious, Torre
thought _ and immediately was in trouble. The Marlins had a runner
at second and Clemens needed 10 pitches to strike out Cliff Floyd.
Wilson, who had a couple of hits Thursday, leaned across the plate
on a 1-1 pitch, and then Clemens threw inside, driving Wilson back.
It was a good sign.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens needed 33 pitches to get through the first inning, but
after the Yankees scored three runs in the bottom of the first, he
could be more aggressive with his fastball _ ``more efficient,'' he
called it. The Marlins scored twice in the third, when Wilson drove
a low fastball to the opposite field, to the right-field stands,
but Thompson hammered a hanging slider from Florida's Ryan Dempster
(9-6) for a three-run shot in the fourth. Clemens was more
comfortable thereafter, his fastball consistently reaching 95 mph,
and he shut out the Marlins in his last four innings.
</P>
<P>
   His beard had been shaved into a goatee after the game, the same
hard face. But Clemens' voice seemed to sink a bit when asked about
the reaction to Piazza's beaning. Clemens reiterated that he would
never say exactly what his plan was in pitching to Piazza that
night, but he indicated that he did have a plan _ to pitch inside,
surely _ that went awry. Others in the organization believe Clemens
meant to knock down Piazza, who had seven hits in 12 at-bats
against Clemens, but not hurt him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt awful about it when everything went down,'' Clemens
said Friday night. ``I'm not going to tell you how I'm going to
pitch to you or try to get him out, but obviously with the game
plan, we had to do something different. But it obviously wasn't to
that extreme. It looked awful.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens said he was told about the adverse reaction from family
and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it bothered them as much, because they know me
personally as an individual,'' he said. ``Some guys that don't know
me write about it, and portray you in the media as someone you're
not when they don't really know me personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens said the only reactions he really cares about are in
this clubhouse. He added: ``Each man, to a man, said `We've got
your back and continue to be aggressive and do what you have to
do.' It's great to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   For his teammates, it was great to see him pitching inside
again.

FLU VACCINE TO BE LATE, MAY BE RATIONED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT MONROE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Flu vaccine will be late this fall and possibly in
short supply because of production problems at four pharmaceutical
companies across the country, federal health officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are
recommending that the most vulnerable get flu shots first and that
public health agencies delay drives - from October to November -
for others to get shots. The CDC also advised health agencies to
create contingency plans for vaccine shortages.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's primarily a matter of delay, and if people are able to
follow recommendations, things should go well,'' said Dr. Keiji
Fukuda, chief of the influenza branch of the CDC's epidemiology
section.
</P>
<P>
   In California, where the flu season usually doesn't peak until
late December and early January, a month's delay is not expected to
cause a major problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about a two- to three-week delay in our flu clinics, and
that's about the biggest thing,'' said Gary Wong, regional
coordinator of preventive care for Kaiser Permanente Southern
California, which gave more than 600,000 flu shots to members last
year and will begin its anti-flu campaign Nov. 1. ``Fortunately,
California generally has a later flu season anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the Los Angeles County Department of Health
Services plan to postpone vaccinations scheduled in the latter half
of October. They plan to give the vaccine first to people 65 and
older who have heart disease or other conditions that make them
especially vulnerable to flu complications, according to an
internal department memo released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswoman Maria Iacobo said, however, that the CDC has sent
out contradictory information in recent weeks about how long public
health agencies should wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still awaiting news from (the CDC), so we'd prefer to
wait to have something clearer to impart to the general public,''
Iacobo said.
</P>
<P>
   Supplies are expected to be late because the producers, which
last year made about 85 million doses, have not been able to make
enough of the vaccine, reformulated to fight a new flu strain
expected to circulate this season. In addition, two of the
companies, Parke-Davis and Wyeth-Ayerst, are experiencing
unspecified production problems under review by the Food and Drug
Administration, Fukuda said.
</P>
<P>
   Wyeth-Ayerst spokesman Doug Petkus said delays in reproducing
cultures of the virus will set delivery of the vaccine back about
four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The news comes even as the CDC is recommending that more
Americans than ever should get flu shots. In years past, the agency
had limited the recommendation to people 65 and older and to others
with certain health problems, but this year recommended shots for
all people over 50.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is no vaccine shortage, it shouldn't be a big
complication,'' Fukuda said. ``If there is a vaccination shortage -
and that's a big if - then what we're suggesting is that it's
appropriate to focus on people within that group who have high-risk
conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Fukuda said the vaccine will include killed forms of the
B/Yamanashi and A/New Caledonia strains, as in last year's batches.
But the drug manufacturers did not produce a hoped-for yield of a
third vaccine, known as A/Panama H3N2, he said. Drug manufacturers
told CDC officials they would need more time to make supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC is issuing no new recommendations about the use of new
antiviral drugs, such as Tamiflu and Relenza. Health authorities
said the drugs, taken at the first sign of flu, should not be
regarded as substitutes for the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, the flu kills about 20,000 people and hospitalizes
110,000 across the country.

Spring's Beckett shrugs off injury, turns heads with gifted arm
<TEXT>
<P>
   By RICHARD JUSTICE
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   Josh Beckett runs a finger over the top of his right shoulder
and points to the spot where the pain began. Three months have
passed since then, and Beckett can afford to call it a learning
experience.
</P>
<P>
   He was sidelined for 44 days _ he counted all of them _ but this
day he's once more healthy and trading playful barbs with Sean
Burroughs, Josh Hamilton and many of baseball's other best
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so frightened I couldn't sleep,'' he said. ``I thought I
was going to have to have surgery. I really did. It hurt that
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   He's standing outside the clubhouse used for last weekend's
Futures Game. It's an hour or so before game time, and before the
afternoon is over, Beckett will take the mound and show dozens of
scouts and general managers why they loved him so much last year
when the Florida Marlins made the former Spring High School star
the second overall pick of the summer baseball draft.
</P>
<P>
   There's the 97-mph fastball that overpowered even some
major-league hitters this spring. There's the Bert Blyleven
curveball that will lock your knees and freeze your bat. And
there's the 6-4 frame and the confidence and the maturity that go
way beyond his 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   And, oh yes, a few weeks ago, there was that terrifying stabbing
pain in his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   He recalls no sign of trouble during a spring training in which
he spent 24 days in the big-league camp and was thrilled just to
share a clubhouse with Alex Fernandez, Cliff Floyd and others. The
Marlins sent him to the mound twice, against the Royals and Braves,
and Beckett more than held his own, compiling a 1.80 ERA while
striking out four and walking none in five innings.
</P>
<P>
   After watching him throw two perfect innings against the Royals,
Marlins manager John Boles gushed: ``That's big-time stuff. They
were late with their swings. He had composure. You don't want to go
crazy with your praise, but my goodness gracious.''
</P>
<P>
   Beckett looked so good and so poised that some wondered if the
Marlins might not change their mind about sending him to the
minors. They didn't. Because he'd never had a full season of
professional baseball and because the roadside is littered with
young flameouts like David Clyde and others, they saw the risk as
too high.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's clear he might not be in the minors long. The
Marlins might have promoted him from a low Class A league to Class
AA by the end of the summer, with a big-league debut projected for
around 2002. For now, he's pitching for Kane County, Ill., in the
Class A Midwest League. He's on a 75-pitch limit. And he's being
told again and again to enjoy the ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last year has just been awesome,'' he said. ``It's been
the most unbelievable experience. I went to big-league camp, and
there's no feeling like it. I learned why people spent 12 years in
the minor leagues to get there. It was awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   He also learned a lesson about how fragile it all is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went down to the minor-league camp, and that might have been
where I overdid it,'' he said. ``I was trying to prove too much.
When you think about the outcome, you corrupt the whole process. I
know it's a cliche, but you've got to take it one pitch at a
time.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows everywhere he goes baseball people nod at one another
and whisper that this guy can't miss, that he's the best pitching
prospect in the minors. In the next breath, they almost always
compare him to some other Texas legend _ to Nolan Ryan or Roger
Clemens or Kerry Wood.
</P>
<P>
   Scouts who have seen both pitchers said Beckett throws harder
and has more polish than Wood at a similar age. So with that kind
of billing, Beckett did the only thing he could do. He kept
throwing hard and ignored the fact his right shoulder was on fire.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth inning of his first start, when the discomfort
worsened, Beckett's only thought was: ``Maybe it'll go away. Maybe
it's just some soreness.''
</P>
<P>
   He never had experienced anything similar at Spring, so he had
nothing to measure it against. He went back to the mound a few days
later and pitched the final four innings of a five-inning start
with the shoulder ``killing me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally told my trainer how bad it was,'' he said. ``I tried
to go out and throw the next day, and it was just so tight I
couldn't throw. It was scary because I didn't know what was going
on with my body.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you learn a lot about what happens with your body
during your first pro season. It's such a long season and you start
to learn the things you need to do before a start, the day after
you start, stuff like that. You've got to take it in stride. You
can't rush it. You've got to take that first year to learn all that
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins, as worried as Beckett, sent him to Chicago for one
exam and then to Fort Lauderdale for another.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me nothing was torn, so I kind of relaxed,'' he
said. ``I was pretty stressed out about it. I got the MRI and all
the tests. They told me I had some inflammation of the biceps
tendon. That was causing the pain.''
</P>
<P>
   He was told to take two weeks away before throwing again, but
ended up on the sideline for more than six.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was still bothering me a little bit when I came back,'' he
said. ``After about four days of long toss, it was great. It's back
to normal now. I don't think it's going to be a recurring thing. If
it does, I'll know what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Beckett has won just one of his eight starts, but his statistics
are those of someone special: a 2.12 ERA with 39 strikeouts and 11
walks in 34 innings. Opponents are hitting .210 against him. In
short, he has been every bit as good as advertised. His fastball
and curveball are big-league-caliber pitches even as he struggles
with a changeup and the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coach Jeff Andrews wants about 10 of his 75 pitches to
be changeups. Beckett said he's trying even though ``there are
times you get so mad you want to give it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrews didn't know what to expect when he was assigned to care
for Florida's top prospect. He's as much a father figure as a
pitching coach, so along with teaching Beckett simple things like
holding on runners, he watches the overall development.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask about his personality,'' Andrews said. ``Well, it's
still developing. He's changing a little bit every day. He's got a
good work ethic and is very single-minded in what he wants to
accomplish. He's got All-Star-caliber stuff, but really, he just
needs to pitch. That's what this season is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Beckett's life has been lived at a fast pace since last summer
when he signed a four-year, $7 million contract that included a
$3.62 million signing bonus. He's using some of that money to build
a home in Spring and donated $100,000 to help Marlins owner John
Henry fund a baseball tournament for 500 South Florida children. He
invested most of the rest.
</P>
<P>
   If he has had trouble adjusting to life away from home, he
hasn't shown it. He has dedicated himself to a weightlifting
program that has added 20 pounds and has tried to soak up as much
knowledge from as many different sources as possible.
</P>
<P>
   During spring training, Beckett refined his pre-game routine by
watching Fernandez. And he has learned again and again the
importance of throwing that first pitch in the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get behind in the count at this level, you're going to
get hit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's Chipper Jones reminded Beckett of that lesson with a
scalding line drive off the wall in spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just needs to keep going out there,'' Andrews said.
``People associate his draft status with his experience. He's a
high school kid 40 innings deep into his pro career. People want a
rush to judgment. They want to know why he doesn't strike out 20
every game. Why does he give up home runs? Those things are unfair
to ask of anyone starting his career in a new environment. He's
just getting started.''
</P>
<P>
   Back home in Spring, his parents, John and Lynn, listen to
Josh's games via the Internet or on a 50-cents-per-minute telephone
line. They have seen him pitch once in Kane County and for an
inning during the Futures Game. They've visited him during spring
training and saw him when he returned home for his girlfriend's
high school graduation and his brother's wedding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a whirlwind and it's still a whirlwind,'' his
mother, Lynn, said. ``If you'd told me two years ago, I'd be doing
interviews I wouldn't have believed it. But you prepare for things
as they come along, and we've tried to prepare for the next step.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a good learning experience for him. He complains
about the travel every once in a while, but he loves baseball. He'd
do anything to play baseball. We're so proud of him, and he has
handled this year excellently.''

ACTIVISTS PRACTICE AT PROTEST CAMP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JORDAN SMITH 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ The revolution began this week, not at a
demonstration at City Hall or an attack on a police station but on
a secluded parcel of land with a sweeping view of the Pacific Ocean
nestled high in the Santa Monica Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 150 activists from across the country have converged on a
beautiful piece of Malibu property for a six-day Democracy Training
Camp that the nonprofit, Berkeley-based Ruckus Society is
sponsoring to prepare activists for protests during next month's
Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're nonviolent revolutionaries, citizen activists, people of
conscience,'' said Ruckus director John Sellers. ``We are looking
to replace the system. We don't want to tweak it, we want to
replace it. People deserve better, they deserve more.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, Ruckus has sponsored such camps to organize
disparate activist groups. Ruckus-trained protesters flooded
Seattle for the World Trade Organization meetings in 1999, and
swamped Washington, D.C., for meetings between the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund this spring.
</P>
<P>
   The activists, who represent a host of concerns and affiliations
- from Earth First and the Direct Action Network to the Los
Angeles-based Youth Organizing Communities - came to the quasi boot
camp to learn how to take direct, nonviolent actions against what
many present consider a corporate takeover of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two-party system is owned by corporate elites and
big-business interests. We really don't have much access to those
who claim to represent us,'' said Han Shan, Ruckus' 27-year-old
program director. ``Give us real democracy, free from corporate
interests. That's what citizenry is supposed to be, what democracy
is supposed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   And the way to replace the you-name-it industrial complex is
through direct actions, he said. While Shan admits Ruckus is known
for its ``more sexy'' protest techniques - such as scaling tall
buildings to hang gigantic protest banners and forming human chains
with PVC pipes - he stressed that most of what Ruckus teaches
activists are techniques of communication and empowerment, skills
to strengthen their larger communities.
</P>
<P>
   So from now until Tuesday evening, activists will learn to tie
knots and scale 60-foot structures, create and maintain human
blockades, begin social change campaigns and consensus building,
defuse tense situations and even talk to the media.
</P>
<P>
   While many said they were at the camp for long-term skill
building, many had their eyes on the more immediate prize -
organizing effective protests during the convention of Aug. 14-17,
as was the case with 29-year-old Pasadena resident Shawn McDougal.
</P>
<P>
   A community organizer for the American Friends Service Committee
and a volunteer with the Bus Riders Union, McDougal said it is
important to be prepared for August's convergence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to get the word out, to explain the ways in which
democracy has been shanghaied by corporate interests,'' he said.
``Our biggest fear is out-of-control police. We're concerned about
the LAPD being provocateurs. Looking at Rampart and the killing of
Margaret Mitchell, I mean, if they said killing her was an
appropriate use of force, then ...''
</P>
<P>
   Uncertainty about Los Angeles Police Department reaction to the
assembling of an expected 50,000 protesters next month was palpable
among the group - many of whom experienced the effects of
police-administered tear gas and flash-bang grenades in Seattle
last winter - when they discussed their fears during a nonviolence
workshop Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on metal folding chairs underneath a hazy midday sun,
activists said they have been misrepresented in the media as
brick-wielding, crazy mayhem-makers bent on destruction and that
they are concerned that the police see them that way as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's not true,'' McDougal said. ``We have clear action
guidelines that say if you want to be a part of our actions you
must sign a nonviolence agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Sellers and Shan agree they can't speak for every protester's
actions. They are committed to helping weed out rogue elements from
their ranks, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do trainings in how to de-escalate situations, how to
approach and interact proactively, to say our message is not to be
co-opted and people are not to be brutalized,'' Sellers said. ``We
just want the cops to do the same, to say that they are not going
to use an escalation of force unless people's safety and health are
in jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   LAPD spokesman Cmdr. Dave Kalish said police believe the
majority of protesters coming to the city next month will
demonstrate peacefully and will obey the laws. But, he added,
police are on the alert for rogue troublemakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often those with the intention to cause major disruptions
become integrated into nonviolent groups and that is difficult for
all involved,'' he said. ``Our intent is to extract, if possible,
those involved with inciting the violence within the nonviolent.
The reality is, that is really difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in camp, a group of 50 protesters lined up for a
role-playing exercise called ``hassle line.'' The scenario: a group
of people with varied interests - National Rifle Association
members, police organizing groups, members of the ``prison
industrial complex'' - are going to a convention delegate-sponsored
dinner. Outside the hotel where the event is to be held, protesters
are forming a chain to block entry. Twenty-five activists each
represent members of the two groups. The objective is to try to
imagine and vocalize what each side would say and do in the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   Then veteran activist trainers Cathie Berrey and Sarah Seeds
debrief the group. How did it feel? What did you say? How did you
react?
</P>
<P>
   Standing in parallel lines, the groups meet in the center.
Tension runs high and body language gets defensive.
</P>
<P>
   Two minutes later, Seeds called time.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, how did it feel?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frustrating,'' McDougal said, an answer given by a majority of
the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Even as members of the dinner-bound group - a representation of
the elements most protesters said they do not support - players
said they felt their intentions to get through the line of
protesters was misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   Engaging in such role play, said Seeds and Berrey, are important
to keeping things cool when push comes to shove. It is important to
try to understand the other side's position and to try to keep
things cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's these discussions that get us to our larger goal,''
Berrey said. ``Confrontation in itself is not violent, but you have
to be aware of your behavior because you don't want your actions to
hurt someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   While ultimately, neither protesters nor police are sure what
will happen downtown next month, there is one thing that is for
sure: This revolution will be televised.

PIAZZA ERASES ANY DOUBTS WITH 2 HOMERS
</HEADLINE>
  By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The New York Mets came back to beat the Boston Red Sox
Friday night, but a more significant comeback took place. Mike
Piazza, it turns out, is just fine.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Mets' catcher played for the first time after
suffering a concussion from a Roger Clemens fastball to the head
last Saturday. He went 1 for 4, and answered countless questions
about whether he had feared anything or felt awkward in the
batter's box.
</P>
<P>
   He answered no on Thursday, and his bat talked for him Friday
night. Piazza blasted two home runs, the second one a game-winner,
as the New York Mets came from behind to beat the Boston Red Sox,
6-4, in a game delayed 62 minutes at the start because of a power
outage at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike's the MVP,'' said Mets catcher Todd Pratt. ``I don't know
how far we're going to go, but right now, he's doing everything
we've always known he could do. It's incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   After blowing the lead to the Boston Red Sox in an ugly seventh
inning, the Mets needed a jolt in the eighth. Red Sox reliever
Hipolito Pichardo had retired all eight batters he faced, but with
two outs in the eighth, Red Sox manager Jimy Williams called on
Derek Lowe, his all-star closer, to face the Mets' two offensive
all-stars.
</P>
<P>
   Edgardo Alfonzo singled, and Piazza _ who missed the All-Star
Game because of the concussion _ came to the plate. He drove a 1-1
curveball from Lowe off a giant cola bottle mounted on the light
tower above the high left field wall, giving the Mets a 5-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``For myself personally, I didn't really worry about any sort of
questions,'' Piazza said. ``I was happy about myself, health-wise,
that I'm OK That sort of has a way of mediating my expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   The homer earned a victory for Pat Mahomes, who got the last out
in a seventh inning in which the Red Sox took the lead with two
runs off three Mets relievers.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' starter, Glendon Rusch, has not walked a batter in his
last 33 2/3 innings. But as soon as he was removed from the game,
the Red Sox drew their first walk, by Jose Offerman off Turk
Wendell to lead off the seventh. After a sacrifice, Dennis Cook
relieved and faced Brain Daubach, who won Thursday's game with a
two-out, two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   Cook had fanned Daubach on a nasty slider on Thursday, and
Williams _ a former Atlanta Braves coach _ had the ball checked
before Cook's first pitch. Cook got ahead in the count, 0-2, and
Williams came onto the field to complain about the way Cook was
rubbing the baseball with his hands between pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been checked probably 50 times between these guys and the
Braves, and every time I get the ball back,'' said Cook. ``I've
been rubbing the ball up for 15 years the same way, and the only
teams that seem to have a problem with it are the Braves and Red
Sox.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook stepped off the rubber and backed away from the mound, then
got back on and stared in for several seconds. It was gamesmanship,
and Daubach did not like it. Annoyed, he stepped out of the
batter's box and walked away from catcher Todd Pratt, who became
irate and confronted Daubach, with umpire Marty Foster coming
between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me to `Save it,''' Pratt said. ``I just said, `Who are
you to tell me to save it?' I couldn't believe a guy who's got one
year in is telling me to save it. I told him how I felt about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The benches and bullpens emptied, but no punches were thrown and
several Red Sox and Mets players joked with each other. Foster
still warned both benches, and on the next pitch, Daubach lined a
single to right, scoring Offerman to tie the score, 3-3.
</P>
<P>
   Cook then walked Nomar Garciaparra, and two pitches later, he
hit Carl Everett in the back of the shoulder. Foster ejected Cook,
who was livid and stalked to the plate pointing, claiming Everett
was crowding the plate.
</P>
<P>
   It got worse one pitch later. Left-hander Rich Rodriguez came
in, and in his first game back from a five-game assignment to
Triple-A Norfolk, Rodriguez allowed a bloop single to Troy O'Leary
that scored Garciaparra to put the Red Sox ahead, 4-3. It was the
third time in the game that O'Leary singled home Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra had kept Rusch in trouble for much of his six
innings. The Red Sox shortstop entered the game with a major
league-leading .391 average, and he was 4 for 4 in the game,
pulling his average to .400 as he chases his second batting title
in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Rusch had left with a 3-2 lead, courtesy of Piazza's first homer
_ which he sent onto Landsdowne St. beyond the left field wall _
and a two-run shot by Mora.
</P>
<P>
   Mora's error on Thursday prolonged the ninth inning and made
possible the Red Sox's comeback victory. Mora was shaky at
shortstop again Friday night, losing the ball on a transfer from
his glove to his hand as he tried to throw to first on a potential
double-play grounder in the second.
</P>
<P>
   But his obvious advantage over his predecessor, Rey Ordonez, is
his offensive ability. Mora bashed one high into the netting above
the Green Monster in left field. It was his sixth homer _ Ordonez
had none _ and it gave the Mets a 3-1 lead.

STABBING DEATH RAISES QUESTIONS OF RACISM IN RESORT TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HECTOR CASTRO  
 and ROBERT L. JAMIESON Jr.  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OCEAN SHORES, Wash. _ In a flash it was over: One man was dying,
three men were fleeing a bloodied parking lot in fear, and this
quiet beach community, where residents don't lock their bicycles,
was left struggling for words.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the July 4 stabbing death of Christopher Kinison, a
20-year-old white man _ allegedly at the hands of two Asian men _
has attracted attention aside from the tourists who flock here in
the summer. White supremacist groups have lined up on one side,
human rights organizations on the other, and townspeople, caught
uncomfortably in between, insist their community is not racist.
</P>
<P>
   But Kinison's death has done more than spark civic
soul-searching. Only the second homicide in the Ocean Shore's 30
years, the case has forced the small police department to juggle
detective work with media scrutiny. Just three days before the
killing, authorities learned that Kinison had joined friends at a
mall, allegedly taunting Asian visitors.
</P>
<P>
   County prosecutors, in the face of criticism, stand by their
decision to charge Minh Duc Hong, the 26-year-old man accused of
killing Kinison, with first-degree manslaughter, not murder.
Prosecutors did not charge Hong's brother, Hung Duc Hong, who
allegedly held Kinison during the attack, or De Qiang Chen, their
friend. Minh Duc Hong is free on $20,000 bond.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, police shed light on the events of July 4 by releasing a
911 dispatch tape; terror resonates in the voice of Hung Duc Hong
who fled with his brother and friend to a hotel after the fight at
a Texaco gas station.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to try to get something to eat and we were getting
harassed by some American kids, '' Hung Duc Hong told the
dispatcher. ``They were like racist stuff. Calling us gooks and
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the group was ``yelling white power and punched me in
the face.''
</P>
<P>
   Kinison's death perplexes some in his town. They are trying to
balance the Hongs' claims of self defense with Kinison's 22 stab
wounds _ balance memories of their friend who had a wild side and a
tender soul.
</P>
<P>
   Kinison once bought long-stemmed roses for a good friend's wife,
and could be counted on if a friend needed to move furniture.
</P>
<P>
   ``His reward was just a smile and a thank you. He was content
with that, never asking for money or saying, `you owe me one' ''
said Jenni Helm, a friend.
</P>
<P>
   One friend said he wasn't surprised Kinison might have started
the fight, or even that he used racist jibes to do it. He was
surprised Kinison was killed. ``I did not think he would ever go
down,'' said James Bohrn. ``I've seen him take down 40-year-old
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never anybody else after them,'' said Randy Deibel,
a friend who witnessed the fight. ``There was just two people
against their three. They could easily have beat him up, got in
their car and left.''
</P>
<P>
   But Monte Hester, the defense attorney for Minh Duc Hong, said
the young Asian men faced a rapidly escalating situation of ``sheer
terror.''
</P>
<P>
   And even Kinison's friends say other factors could have made the
threat appear greater than it was intended. For one, Kinison waved
a Confederate flag _ viewed by some people as a symbol of racism.
And Kinison showered the Asian men with sharp taunts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did not know him,'' Deibel said. ``They did not know
Chris was just a small town, local boy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kinison also had a rap sheet. In October 1997, he was
convicted of possession of marijuana and of having a dangerous
weapon _ a butterfly knife. Also in 1997, he was investigated for
racially harassing a group of African American youths; no charges
were filed. In 1999, Ocean Shores police said, he and a friend were
arrested for using a gun to shoot out street lights.
</P>
<P>
   White supremacist groups said Kinison's history of trouble _ and
even his taunting of the Hongs _ was no reason for getting stabbed
22 times; they lambasted the Hong brothers claim of self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have a situation where if you are a minority you can
murder a European American and walk free,'' said David Jensen,
spokesman for the Western Washington chapter of the National
Organization for European American Rights.
</P>
<P>
   The local chapter, which claims more than 200 paid members, is
part of the national group started by David Duke, a former Ku Klux
Klanman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what's right and what's wrong, and so far I have seen a
violation of (Kinison's) rights,'' said Jensen, who plans to attend
the trial this fall. If need be, he said, Duke could come to
Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   However, Eric Ward of the Northwest Coalition for Human Dignity
said the group is exploiting bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's their goal. Our best defense is to demand that our
community, our public officials, deal fairly and honestly with the
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Grays Harbor Prosecutor H. Steward Menefee said Friday night
that the charges filed were appropriate. ``I don't think it is
appropriate for any group to try to use this situation to inflame
racial tensions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many people here do not see a broad-based racial problem. ``We
are a small town. We'd see signs of something if it was building
up,'' said detective Sgt. Dave McManus. ``Everybody knows
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The feeling is not universal. Kinison's tauntings of the Hongs,
witnesses said, were steeped in ignorance and post-adolescent
brashness.
</P>
<P>
   Kinison, friends said, did not mind a fight _ and sometimes used
his mouth to start one. ``They didn't believe what they said,''
Deibel said of Kinison and his friends. ``They would say anything
to start a fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Around town, Kinison and his friends were part of crew that
frequented local establishments _ to drink and have fun. Other
options for young people, they said, are few.
</P>
<P>
   Ask a young person what it is like in Ocean Shores past midnight
most evenings. ``Dead,'' said 18-year-old James Troyell, as he hung
out with friends by the closed bowling alley late one recent
evening.
</P>
<P>
   The main drag, Chance ala Mer, begins at the Pacific Ocean and
rolls into the heart of the town. Most business along it are in the
first half-mile, beginning with the massive Shilo Inn, and ending
at Point Brown Avenue, where the 24-hour Texaco gas station and
market sits.
</P>
<P>
   In between are shops selling kites, renting scooters, and
catering to tourists.
</P>
<P>
   The street most nights is quiet until 1:30 a.m. _ until last
call arrives at The Legend Inn, a bar on Chance ala Mer. Then, the
rush is on. Bar patrons make a quick dash to the Texaco for beer
before sales end at 1:45 a.m. ``The only thing going on is the
24-hour Texaco,'' said 18-year-old Philip Tanguy, a friend of
Kinison's.
</P>
<P>
   But, several locals said, the nights leading up to the Fourth of
July tend to be different; Ocean Shores becomes a party town.
``It's always a local's worst nightmare,'' one resident said.
Authorities said the town's population swells during the holiday to
80,000.
</P>
<P>
   This last holiday was no different.
</P>
<P>
   Deibel, a 27-year-old construction worker, was out that night to
retrieve his truck, which had broken down at the Texaco when his
wife went there to get something to eat.
</P>
<P>
   Walking to the gas station, he ran into Kinison and three of
Kinison's friends; Kinison had a Confederate flag draped around
shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why those guys had that flag,'' Deibel said.
</P>
<P>
   Deibel went to The Legend, a tavern, to get a relative to help
him get the truck. Then he went to the Texaco, where Kinison was
with perhaps 20 people, all mingling in a holiday party atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Kinison soon stood apart from the crowd, witnesses said _ and
that's when Minh Duc Hong, his brother and a friend drove up in
their gold Honda.
</P>
<P>
   Kinison began to taunt the trio, even when friends told him to
stop because a police officer had passed by moments earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But to the Hongs, their defense attorneys say, the taunts were
threats.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said inside the market, Minh Duc Hong grabbed a pair
of 4-inch kitchen knives, packaged for sale and hooked on a peg
board near a kite display.
</P>
<P>
   Hong, his brother and friend left the store and got into the
car. Hong's defense attorney Monte Hester said three wanted to
leave, but Kinison blocked the car's path.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said Kinison stepped close to the car and waved his
flag, but did not block it. The taunts continued, and witnesses
said the men stepped out of the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could hear Chris say, `I'll take both of you on,' '' Deibel
said.
</P>
<P>
   Away from the main crowd, one of Kinison's friends fought Chen;
meanwhile Kinison allegedly fought with the two brothers. Many of
Kinison's friends, who were several dozen feet away, were unaware
of the severity of the fight.
</P>
<P>
   It was soon clear Kinison was losing the fight, and Deibel
thought his friend had ``had enough'' so he walked toward him. At
the same time, Kinison broke free and ran toward Deibel's truck,
less than 50 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   The Hongs stared at Deibel and, with Chen, ran to their car.
</P>
<P>
   Only then did people realize Kinison was hurt. Some girls
screamed. Friends took off their shirts to stop bleeding from
Kinison's wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Kinison then leaned over the bed of his truck, and uttered what
were among his last words: ``It hurts.''

MOSS COMPLETES THREE-GAME SHOT AT BASKETBALL 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SEAN KEARNS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH _ Randy Moss became bored this summer. So the
Minnesota Vikings' wide receiver decided to evaluate his basketball
abilities against the professional talent at the Southern
California Summer Pro League.
</P>
<P>
   Without any preparation, Moss threw on his Michael Jordan
sneakers for three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came out here, just (on) straight talent,'' Moss said.
</P>
<P>
   The talent didn't really show through until Friday when Moss
finished up his three-day basketball run. In front of Vikings coach
Dennis Green and a smattering of Viking fans at the Long Beach
State Pyramid, Moss scored 18 points, including four 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, I just wanted to see where my talents were,''
said Moss, who broke a two-day silence on his basketball
intentions. ``I just wanted to come out here and play and give
myself a good look.''
</P>
<P>
   Moss didn't rule out a future attempt at the NBA but he didn't
think he was ready to make the jump yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say that (I'm ready),'' Moss said. ``It's still a
lot &QL;
</P>
<P>
   of work. I just wanted to play out here against some guys that
are capable of going to the NBA. I already have a job, to have a
second job would be nice. I'm not going out here trying to make
myself become a basketball player knowing that I'm a football
player.''
</P>
<P>
   Moss, playing for the Magic Johnson All Stars, entered the game
against Play 2 Win and hit his first shot, a 3-pointer, almost
right in front of Green's seat. The Viking coach let out a large
grin after the shot went in.
</P>
<P>
   Green, in town after vacationing in San Diego, told Moss' agent
that he would catch a game if he could.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy made the decision a long time ago to play football,''
Green said. ``If he wanted to go play basketball he could have done
that. He chose not to. So I don't have any problems with him going
out there and having fun and competing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get afraid of injuries any time he goes on the football
field but you can't operate from fear. You have to remember players
get hurt all the time in sports. It's not because he's out here
playing basketball. It's because freak accidents happen. That did
not make me hesitate supporting him in his decision to compete and
have some fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Moss played high school basketball in West Virginia with
Sacramento point guard Jason Williams. The two won a state title
together.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Moss said that he would be interested in playing with
the Minnesota Timberwolves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are two things that Randy is focused on now:
having a great year and getting a great contract,'' Green said. ``I
think anything about the Timberwolves is going to be down the
road.''
</P>
<P>
   Viking training camp opens on July 23. Moss has spent much of
his summer in preparation for the football season, working out with
quarterback Daunte Culpepper and wide receiver Cris Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Moss followed his first 3-pointer with a second 3. Then he
floated in for a finger roll on a fast break. It was a far cry from
his previous performance, in which he scored 9 points on 4-of-13
shooting and even airballed a free throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all right,'' Moss said of his performance. ``I needed
to come out here and do something. The first two games I came out
here and was really not too hot. I just wanted to come out here and
do a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Moss was tied for high-point honors in leading his team, owned
by Magic Johnson, to a 88-75 win.
</P>
<P>
   For his three games, Moss averaged 13.3 points and impressed
players and scouts with his athleticism. Scouts agreed that Moss is
not ready to play in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pro Bowler was noticed for his work on the football
field.
</P>
<P>
   When Moss entered Friday's game, teammate Wilson Stevens
remarked, ``Let's go get a touchdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Former UCLA guard Kris Johnson covered Moss for much of Friday's
game. Johnson is a big Moss fan and while lining up defensively
made a point of telling him so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, you're the man in football,'' Johnson told Moss.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who played in the CBA last season, was surprised how
well Moss shot the ball but said that he needed to improve his ball
handling. Overall, he said Moss was an OK basketball player.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are incredible athletes,'' Johnson said of football
players. ``That's why a guy like Randy Moss can come out here and
look more than halfway decent. ... I'm sure if this was his main
thing from day one he would probably be in the NBA right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Moss clearly hasn't given up the dream and even said that a goal
of his would be to play in the summer league on a more full-time
basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, throughout the years,'' Moss said.

MARION JONES CRUISES AT OLYMPIC TRIALS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ It is a long process that will not be
resolved for two and a half months, but Marion Jones took her first
fleet steps on the long journey toward five gold medals Friday
night, cruising through the 100-meter preliminaries in 10.92
seconds at the U.S. Olympic track and field trials.
</P>
<P>
   Later Friday night she qualified in her weakest event, finishing
fifth in the preliminary round of the long jump with a leap of 21
feet 6} inches. Jackie Joyner-Kersee came out of retirement and
also qualified for Sunday's final by jumping 21}, her first attempt
in two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long jump, it's all about making the final,'' said
Jones, who added about the 100: ``I think I can run faster than I
ever have before.''
</P>
<P>
   The world's fastest man, Maurice Greene, ran this year's
second-fastest time of 9.93 seconds in his 100-meter preliminary.
Michael Johnson ran the opening round of the 400 meters winning his
heat in 45.16 seconds as he seeks to repeat his Olympic double with
gold medals at 200 meters and the quarter-mile. But the focus of
this meet is on Jones and her attempt to do what no female athlete
has ever done _ win five gold medals in track and field at the same
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not looking to win silver or bronze,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   And the more people tell Jones that she cannot win five golds at
the Summer Games in Sydney, Australia, the more convinced she is
that she can. She has been accomplishing the extraordinary all of
her life: nine state high school championships in California, a
collegiate basketball title at North Carolina as a freshman point
guard, a pair of world championships at 100 meters, 36 consecutive
victories running and jumping in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, going for five golds is continuing to achieve what
doesn't seem reasonable to some or what people told her she
couldn't do,'' said Ron Rapoport, who wrote Jones' biography, ``See
How She Runs.'' ``This is one more. When people say, `You can't do
that,' she puts it to the farthest reach. I think it helps her with
the events that she's been able to dominate.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones has not lost a foot race since the end of the 1997 season.
And she is not likely to lose at 100 meters at the Olympic trials.
Her personal best of 10.65 seconds is the fastest time run by any
woman except Florence Griffith-Joyner, whose world record of 10.49
seconds was allowed to stand at the 1988 Olympic trials despite the
widespread belief that a strong tail wind was not properly recorded
by a faulty wind gauge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm ready to run my personal best at any time,''
Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Is there anyone who can beat her at 100 meters? Inger Miller,
the 1999 world champion at 200 meters and Jones' chief sprinting
rival, struggled recently in the 100 in Europe, finishing fifth at
a meet in Athens and sixth in Rome. Friday night, she ran her
seasonal best of 11.04 seconds, while the two-time Olympic champion
Gail Devers ran a 10.99. Both will compete in Saturday's
semifinals; the final is also Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was just training,'' Miller said of her mediocre
performances overseas. ``I was trying to see what I could do when I
was tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Bolstered by her world 200 title in 21.77 seconds last year at
the world championships in Seville, Spain, Miller has been saying
that women's sprinting ``is no longer a one-woman show.'' Jones
pulled up with back spasms at the event.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of Lennox Miller, a two-time Olympic sprint
medalist from Jamaica, Inger Miller has a beautifully fluid stride.
This technical proficiency aids her significantly in maintaining
her form through the grind of running rounds. But one of her
training partners, Ato Boldon, the 1996 Olympic bronze medalist at
100 and 200 meters, believes that she has become distracted by her
fixation on beating Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has shown me yet that they are ready to run with Marion
in the latter half of the 100 meters,'' said Boldon, who trains
with Miller under the sprint coach John Smith in Los Angeles and
who is considered one of the more astute students of sprinting. ``I
think Inger has to have more vision than, `I just want to beat
Marion here.' I think her focus should be on `getting my act
together, and qualifying, then dealing with Marion.' She'll face
Marion a lot in Europe. That's when you work your magic.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones' form in the 100 suggests the rawness of power and speed
more than the silky grace, say, of Carl Lewis, but there is a
tremendous resolve and control evident in the way she runs. Unlike
most women, Johnson noted, Jones does not cross her chest with her
arms as she sprints but is strong enough to keep them
piston-pumping straight up and down in rhythm with her legs.
</P>
<P>
   Boldon said: ``Technically, she's not as good as she was in the
past, but she's gotten stronger so it doesn't matter. People who
know the sport do not use Marion as the textbook example of
technique. You look at Marion as an athlete, her ability to
compete, how she focuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Her form in the long jump is more troubling, and, some believe,
more susceptible to injury. She has decided to let speed carry her
to great distances, rather than to rely on any intricate technique.
Her best jump this season is 22 feet 10{ inches, fifth on the world
list. But she is erratic and prone to fouls. Many experts,
including Mike Powell, the men's world record holder at 29-4{,
believe that Jones should be jumping 24 feet regularly and
threatening 25 feet, which is four inches beyond the women's world
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``She may be jumping badly, then she can put a far jump out
there if she does something right,'' Powell said. ``She can jump 23
feet by accident, she's so talented. But she shouldn't have to rely
on accident.''

are as powerful as ever _ even though, like most bystander videos,
they do not present a full or clear picture of precisely what
happened. That is usually the main issue when cases involving
videotaped evidence come to trial: defense lawyers argue, as they

GRANT SAVORS A TASTE OF NEW YORK
</HEADLINE>
  By STEVE POPPER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ On Wednesday afternoon, Brian Grant and his wife,
Gina, arrived at Newark International Airport like other harried
tourists, setting their itinerary for New York City. But between
the usual attractions, Grant found himself being courted by the New
York Knicks. By the time he was eating a final piece of New York
cheesecake as he waited for his flight home to Portland, Ore., he
was ready to turn the two-night vacation into a permanent home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming out, I was all Portland,'' Grant said as he signed
autographs from fans who lined up to tell him to stay. ``But coming
back, it's a toss-up, 50-50. I could come to New York or I could
stay in Portland. New York sold me.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they work something out, then I will come to New York.''
</P>
<P>
   More difficult than the recruiting process for the Knicks is
actually figuring out a deal to get Grant to New York. Although he
opted out of his contract with the Portland Trail Blazers, the
Knicks are over the salary cap and can only offer him a $2.25
million midlevel exception. The way the deal can be done is through
a sign-and-trade agreement between the Blazers and the Knicks. But
until the Knicks can figure out a package that will appease the
Blazers, the pursuit of Grant is just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we may say, `Yeah, we want to come to New York,'
they don't have to trade me,'' Grant said of the Trail Blazers.
``It's up in the air. Just because I say I want to be in New York,
doesn't mean necessarily that they would bring me to New York.''
</P>
<P>
   He also cited speaking with Charlie Ward and Allan Houston, who
share his religious beliefs, as a key selling point.
</P>
<P>
   Grant's agent, Mark Bartelstein, said his client would not try
to pressure Portland into making any trades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian is not one to go around issuing ultimatums,''
Bartelstein said. ``He just doesn't work that way. The Blazers are
a great opportunity for Brian, and the Knicks are a great
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the teams' general managers, Bartelstein said,
``Scott Layden and Bob Whitsett are going to talk, and they'll see
if they have something to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant did see some of the typical attractions, like the Statue
of Liberty, during his New York stay, but unlike the tourists who
crowd onto the Circle Line, he saw it from the deck of the yacht of
James L. Dolan, the president of Cablevision. Rather than taking in
a show, he was solicited by the stars of the shows. But it was the
pastoral country homes of Westchester County and Connecticut and
the promise of a vital role on a contending team that convinced
Grant that he could adjust to life in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I say I'm scared of living in the city, I don't mean I'm
scared of the people,'' Grant said. ``I just mean that I'm from a
small town of 2,500 people. Portland is a smaller city and it's
easier to get adjusted to, so I never thought I'd be able to adjust
to living in New York City. Actually, you don't have to live in New
York City, but yet you still can travel in and out of New York City
being a part of the Knicks.''
</P>
<P>
   He had praise for the Knicks' management and its impression of
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything they've said has been right on time as far as
factual stuff,'' Grant said. ``It's not like they're just blowing
me up. It's things you can look at and say, `You're right, you're
right.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I would make a great fit here as far as adding to the
great team that they already have here. Do I make this team that
much better? Who knows? But I'm a similar-type player as far as
what they bring to the table. They're a very hard-nosed defensive
team that plays well together.''
</P>
<P>
   While the NBA rules prohibit teams from actually negotiating
until Aug. 1, the Knicks accomplished their goal of proving to
Grant that he could be a vital piece of the team and town. ``It's a
recruiting process and I know that,'' he added. ``But it just feels
good to have all that going on.''

JOHNSON DOESN'T PLAN TO CHANGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Dodgers manager Davey Johnson understands the
pressure is mounting to have a strong second half and make a push
for the playoffs, but that doesn't mean he's going to do anything
different.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job doesn't change from day to day. I try to do what's best
for today as well as tomorrow,'' Johnson said. ``Whatever comes
down, you try to solve the problems you have on a daily basis. The
bottom line is to give us a chance to be in position to win the
division.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I do, and I've been successful at it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past 10 days it's become clear that changes could be
coming if the Dodgers don't improve on their 44-42 mark they had at
the All-Star break. Before the break, managing general partner and
CEO Bob Daly traveled to San Diego and spoke with Johnson. Daly
said the Dodgers need to play with more fire and urgency.
</P>
<P>
   During the All-Star break, general manager Kevin Malone said
everyone in the organization had to improve, starting with
management, Johnson and the coaching staff. On the field, Malone
said the Dodgers need to hit behind runners more often, manufacture
runs and do the little things to win ballgames instead of relying
on the home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it's injuries, or suspensions or poor performance or
whatever, you have all those things in the course of a season,''
Johnson said. ``Having injuries that cut into your depth, that's
when you need to be able to do things within the system, and I feel
like we've come a long way. We're better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we have a chance? Yeah, we have a chance. You say, 'Can you
do things better?' Well, you can always do things better. We have
young players who are learning who they are (Adrian) Beltre, (Alex)
Cora. You have some veterans who have struggled at times, that's
part of the game. Getting past this short-handed period (with Todd
Hundley and Mark Grudzielanek hurt), to me, this is probably the
toughest part of our season.''
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek better: The Dodgers' plans to put second baseman
Mark Grudzielanek on the disabled list went awry, particularly
because of an oversight and partly because Grudzielanek's condition
improved enough that he believes he'll be able to play Sunday or
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek missed the last five games due to a viral
infection, and though his condition improved he's only hopeful for
the series with Pittsburgh. But keeping the Dodgers from placing
Grudzielanek on the disabled list is circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   The team had planned on recalling infielder Mike Metcalfe from
Triple-A Albuquerque, and Grudzielanek's move was going to be
retroactive to last Friday. However, since Metcalfe wasn't sent
back to the minors until after Sunday's game in Seattle,
Grudzielanek would have to be placed on the disabled list
retroactive to Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, since Grudzielanek believes he'll be ready by the end
of the weekend, the Dodgers elected not to put him on the disabled
list and lose him for an additional week.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Grudzielanek's injury, shortstop Alex Cora made his
second start of the season at second base.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to realize you have more time over there so you take
more time,'' Johnson said. ``I feel safer with (Cora) over there
than Elster, than teaching a new dog, new tricks.''
</P>
<P>
   Spring training decision: An announcement about an agreement
that would keep the Dodgers in Vero Beach, Fla., for the next 20
years was delayed until next week because of a snag. The Dodgers
weren't sure whether the designs of the new stadium were compliant
with the Americans with Disabilities Act, so research had to be
done, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers were slated to announce an agreement with Vero Beach
and Indian River County (Fla.), but it was put off until the
stadium questions could be answered. However, that should be taken
care of and an announcement is likely within a week, a source said.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield appeal: Jim Naeder, the agent for Gary Sheffield, said
his client plans to go through with the appeal of his five-game
suspension, though the commissioner's office hasn't set a date for
the hearing. Dodgers officials believe commissioner Bud Selig will
hear the appeal when the club is in Philadelphia July 28-30.

STONEMAN WELCOMES MORE REVENUE SHARING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON VERRELL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Bill Stoneman, the Angels' general manager, said
Friday night at Dodger Stadium he's not opposed at all to a
revision in Major League Baseball's revenue-sharing plan.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he said he's all for it, and added that he needs to
look only as far as his former team, the Montreal Expos, for a
reason why.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a team with little or no money coming in from (English)
radio-TV, so where's the money going to come from without shared
revenue?'' wondered Stoneman, who pitched five years for the Expos
(1969-73) and was a member of the club's front office for the past
17 years until joining the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Stoneman played for the Expos when their home was cozy and
intimate Jarry Park, not the vast Olympic Stadium where they play
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Olympic Stadium hasn't worked out the way they thought it
would,'' conceded Stoneman, noting the Expos' are averaging a
National League-low 7,444 fans for their 85 home games.
</P>
<P>
   Freeway Series SigAlert?
</P>
<P>
   So far, the interleague Freeway Series between the Angels and
Dodgers has had nowhere near the impact at the turnstiles as
interleague series between the Mets and Yankees in New York and the
Cubs and White Sox in Chicago, where packed houses are the norm.
</P>
<P>
   The three games between the Angels and Dodgers last month in
Anaheim averaged a shade under 40,000. The first game of the
current series at Dodger Stadium Thursday night was played before
35,456, meaning more than 20,000 seats went unused.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of dynamics go into attendance . . . why and why not
fans come out,'' said Angels manager Mike Scioscia, wisely taking a
diplomatic stance inasmuch as the question had to do with his
current employer as well as his former.
</P>
<P>
   ``Southern California is a baseball hotbed, I know that,'' he
said. ``I've seen it. With the Dodgers we'd always get our 3
million (annual attendance), and I remember going to Anaheim for
the (exhibition) Freeway Series and there'd be 60,000 fans out
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why there aren't more now, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night's Dodger Stadium crowd --- 53,115 --- was the
biggest yet for this year's Angels-Dodgers Freeway Series, although
it was lured in part by a giveaway. It was Sports Watch Night.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even with smart new timepieces the fans were late in
arriving.
</P>
<P>
   Angels left-hander Scott Schoeneweis, on a minor league rehab
assignment, hurled 4 fr 2/3 innings Friday night for Lake Elsinore
in a Class-A California League game at San Bernardino.
</P>
<P>
   Schoeneweis, disabled since June 27 because of a strained muscle
in his right rib cage, gave up just one run on three hits. He
struck out three and walked three.
</P>
<P>
   He'll likely make one more minor league start before he's
activated. Before he was hurt Schoeneweis was 5-5 with a 5.08
earned run average in 14 starts.

JOYNER-KERSEE ISN'T QUITE FINISHED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO - ``Fair jump,'' proclaimed public address announcer
Scott Davis after Jackie Joyner-Kersee struck sand in her first
competitive leap in two years. Davis wasn't taking editorial
license; he was simply letting the swooning Hornet Stadium sellout
crowd of 23,211 know the four-time Olympian's long jump was legal.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, there really was no better way to sum up
Joyner-Kersee's jumping on this first day of the 2000 Olympic Track
and Field Trials.
</P>
<P>
   It was fair.
</P>
<P>
   The reigning American record holder in the long jump mustered a
leap of 21-0 on her third and final attempt to become the eighth
qualifier in the 12-woman final on Sunday. Former Thousand Oaks
resident Marion Jones, the woman whom Joyner-Kersee was supposed to
have passed the torch to three years ago at the U.S. nationals, was
fifth with a jump of 21-6 after leading all qualifiers in the 100
meters roughly two hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The past and future queens of U.S. track and field were assigned
to different pits, which had the same effect as a mist machine,
effectively cooling off any rivalry that exists between them.
</P>
<P>
   When the 38-year-old Joyner-Kersee was introduced at the start
of the competition, the crowd's applause lasted longer than had
Jones' 100 meters run. It was a fitting way to welcome back the
woman whose grace and graciousness had remained unparalleled
throughout the 1990s even after her world records in the heptathlon
and long jump were surpassed.
</P>
<P>
   Joyner-Kersee, jumping 13th (talk about bad omens) in her
flight, attacked the runway on the first jump as though running in
shower shoes. Her strides weren't eating huge chunks of the runway
as they once did and, predictably, her leap left her hungry. It
measured 20-7, which was four inches less than her jump at a meet
in her hometown of East St. Louis in 1998 that had sent her into
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   As she dusted herself off, Joyner-Kersee engaged in a dialogue
with herself. ``Girl,'' she said, disgusted, ``you've got to come
back with something better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, she would say, ``I was hoping to only take one jump. When
that plan didn't work out, all you can do is shake your head and
come up with another plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Running through the pit for a foul was not what Joyner-Kersee
had in mind. Yet that's what happened on her second attempt. All of
the sudden the thermometer trackside might as well have read 120
degrees for all the sweat gathering on Joyner-Kersee's brow.
</P>
<P>
   The heat she felt was intense because she knew her first jump
wouldn't land her in the finals. It was do-or-go-home-and-cry time
for Joyner-Kersee, who has a history of prospering under such
pressure. She leaped from seventh place to third on her final
effort in the 1996 Olympic final with a jump that covered 22-11.
Her last try Friday, while not as prodigious, represented progress.
</P>
<P>
   On this night, that was good enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby (Kersee, her coach and husband) said I wasn't
attacking,'' said Joyner-Kersee, who has been training for her
comeback since April. ``I told him, `What do you expect?' The more
I was jumping, the better I felt. That made me feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodness knows Joyner-Kersee has nothing left to prove on the
track. She is the most decorated U.S. female track athlete with six
Olympic medals, three of them gold. She has set world records, seen
the world and influenced a generation of athletes that includes
Jones, who calls Joyner-Kersee her idol.
</P>
<P>
   Joyner-Kersee said she wants to make a fifth Olympic team not so
much because it would give her a place in history alongside
American long jumper and sprinter Willye White, but because it
would give her one more chance to have fun at an Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never enjoyed an Olympics,'' Joyner-Kersee said.
</P>
<P>
   The regimented routine required to be a champion didn't leave
any room for frivolity. She had to stay in her room, stay off her
feet, stay focused.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the next thing I know I'm on an airplane going back
home,'' Joyner-Kersee said.
</P>
<P>
   She vowed it'll be different next time. That is, if there is a
next time. One athlete who knows her well cautioned against
counting Joyner-Kersee out.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinter/hurdler Gail Devers, who trains with Joyner-Kersee in
St. Louis, said, ``I tell people all the time, if Jackie says she's
coming back and you see her warming up, you better watch out.
That's the bottom line.''

BIG NAMES STAND OUT AT TRIALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL OBERJUERGE  
 San Bernardino Sun 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO -- Maurice Greene made a statement in 9.93 seconds,
Michael Johnson answered with the greatest of ease, and Marion
Jones and Jackie Joyner-Kersee set up a May-December women's
long-jump final.
</P>
<P>
   The sport's biggest names made the biggest waves Friday in Day 1
of the U.S. Olympic Track and Field Trials at Sacramento State.
</P>
<P>
   Greene clocked a quick, 9.93-second time in the first round of
100-meter qualifying, and he did it despite glancing back at
pursuers at the 70-meter mark, and practically jogging the final
five meters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people thought I came in here not ready to
run,'' Greene said. ``I ran a couple of bad races (in Europe), but
those were practice. This is serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not completely. Had Greene run full speed through his race
Friday he might have threatened his own world record of 9.79
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a lot left,'' he said. ``My coach (John Smith) thinks
I can run a 9.6. We'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene's 9.93 was the 27th sub-10-second clocking in his career,
extending his own record, and was the second-fastest in the world
this year to his 9.91.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, Greene's rival for alpha male in the world of
sprinters, practically coasted to a day's-best clocking of 45.18
seconds in the first round of the 400 meters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's supposed to feel as smooth and easy as it looks,'' said
Johnson , who wore a pair of ``chameleon green'' shoes. ``At this
point, I don't think I need to work on anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene and Johnson have the 100 and 400, respectively, to take
care of first, but each already seems to be looking forward to a
showdown in the 200-meter final on July 23.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what he hopes to accomplish here, Greene said, ``Get
Michael Johnson, that's what I want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyner-Kersee and Jones, divas of American women's track past
and present, each qualified for Sunday's long-jump final, but
neither overawed the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' best jump was 21 feet, 6 3/4 inches, more than 2 feet shy
of her personal best, and put her fifth in the qualifying field of
12.
</P>
<P>
   Joyner-Kersee, competing for the first time since 1998, was
eighth in 21-0 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why am I here? Because I want to try to make my fifth Olympic
team,'' said Joyner-Kersee, heptathlon world-record holder. ``I
want to go to one and just have fun. All the other times, it was
`Get off your feet and rest' during the heptathlon, and the next
thing I knew I was on the plane home.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones is 24 and headed for her first Olympics, where she hopes
to win five gold medals. Joyner-Kersee is 38, and resumed training
in earnest only a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get a chance to compete against her, my hero, is
wonderful,'' Jones said of Joyner-Kersee.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones was the top qualifier in the women's 100, at 10.92
seconds. She believes she could approach her personal best of 10.65
in today's semifinals and finals.
</P>
<P>
   In other competition Friday:
</P>
<P>
   -- American-record holder Jeff Hartwig became the first victim
of the top-three-or-else nature of the U.S. trials, no-heighting in
pole-vault qualifying. He set the U.S. record of 19-9 1/2 exactly
one month before he failed to clear 18-2 at Hornet Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   -- Marla Runyan, the legally blind middle-distance runner,
overcame a knee injury to finish second in her heat and qualify for
the women's 1,500-meter final Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   -- DeDee Nathan leads the heptathlon after four events, with
3,747 points, narrowly ahead of Tracye Lawyer with 3,723 points.
</P>
<P>
   -- Mebrahtom Keflezighi of UCLA, a native of Eritrea, won the
men's 10 ,000-meter qualifying in an Olympic-qualifying time of 28
minutes, 3.32 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   -- In the day's other final, Deena Drossin won the women's
10,000 in 3 1:51.06.

DODGERS LOSE GAME, POSSIBLY BROWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Gary Sheffield continued his assault on the
Dodgers' home run record and Darin Erstad assaulted the Dodgers
with a two-run homer in the seventh inning. But much of that was
lost in Anaheim's 5-3 win Friday at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, everyone associated with the Dodgers had a sleepless
night wondering how badly staff ace Kevin Brown's right shoulder is
strained.
</P>
<P>
   Brown left the game after throwing his first pitch in the top of
the eighth inning. The preliminary diagnosed was a mildly strained
right shoulder. However, Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said the
extent to which Brown injured his shoulder won't be known until
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``My shoulder really has been out of whack since San Diego,''
Brown said. ``I was sliding around on the mound, kind of strained
it a little bit. Thought there was nothing to it and I felt a lot
better the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, in the second year of a seven-year, $105 million
contract, told pitching coach Claude Osteen he experienced
discomfort in his right shoulder during his July 6 start in San
Diego. But Johnson said he wasn't alerted to it.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who allowed nine hits and four runs and fell to 8-3, is
listed as day to day. He will be re-evaluated today, but his start
Wednesday against Colorado is in question.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first I heard of it (the injury),'' Johnson said.
``Normally, I would hear something about that. He didn't say
anything during the ballgame about it. I don't know why I didn't
know about it. I'm going to find out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, 'Why am I hearing it after the fact?' Sometimes they
don't want to say something about it, but I wish I would have know
that was bothering him going into the All-Star Game. I wouldn't
have let him throw.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield hit a pair of solo homers to give the Dodgers leads of
1-0 and 2-1, and in doing so, became the second-fastest Dodger to
reach the 30-homer mark. He did it in 88 games while Duke Snider
did it in 87 games in 1955 when the Dodgers were in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   But Sheffield's offensive exploits were of little consequence,
especially given what happened with Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him wince and at first I thought it might just be a
blister,'' Sheffield said. ``Then I thought about the All-Star
Game, and how they rushed him in and there was no real chance for
him to get ready. I just hope it's not serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who walked three and gave up a run during his one shaky
inning at Tuesday's All-Star Game, missed two weeks in April when
he broke his right pinkie attempting to bunt against the Mets. He
was pitching Friday instead of Thursday because Johnson wanted to
give him an extra day to rest after the All-Star appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He remarked in the San Diego game, after he a threw a pitch
and slipped a little bit, but I don't think it was to the point
where he couldn't pitch or anything like that,'' Osteen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see anything warming up where he was restricted or
anything. All the pitches were going for him in the bullpen, and he
had them all in the game until the fifth or sixth inning. We
thought we saw a pitch in the sixth inning that looked out of sync,
that didn't look like a normal delivery.''
</P>
<P>
   Troy Glaus started the Angels' three-run seventh inning with a
homer into the left-field bleachers. Adam Kennedy lined out to Eric
Karros at first and Matt Walbeck grounded to short, but pitcher
Kent Bottenfield got his second hit, a single to right field.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad continued to pound the ball, hitting a 1-1 pitch deep
into the Angels bullpen in right field to give them a 4-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad also made a diving catch for the first out in the ninth
inning with Alex Cora on first and Sheffield on deck. Angels closer
Troy Percival then walked Sheffield but got Shawn Green to ground
into a game-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Erstad) has to be close to the MVP in the league,'' said
Bottenfield, who improved to 6-7 after allowing three hits in seven
innings. ``He gets us started, he has great clutch RBI, he's all
over the field doing everything.''

SPARKS RALLY TO BEAT COMETS

   INGLEWOOD _ The Sparks showed just how bad they can play and how
good they could play Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It was the biggest game of the season, a possible preview to the
WNBA Championship, No. 2 vs. No. 1, the Sparks and three-time
defending champions and the Sparks didn't appear ready for prime
time.
</P>
<P>
   Even though they seemingly had the advantage when Houston's star
Cynthia Cooper was advised by the Comets trainer less than an hour
before the game not to play on a severely sprained right ankle she
suffered in Wednesday's game against Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   But just when it look as if the Sparks' hopes were dashed, the
team which had one 12 consecutive games at one point, resurfaced
and reversed the roles of fortune.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks turned up their defense with seven minutes remaining
to erase a 15-point deficit and send a season-high Forum crowd of
11,378 into a frenzy with an amazing 63-58 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our players just decided they wanted to start playing,''
Sparks coach Michael Cooper said. ``I got kind of verbal with them
at half time, but still that didn't work. It was just that they had
been pushed around and slammed and Houston was beginning to stick
their chest out and they just started to play. Maybe fatigue caught
up to Houston because their two big players were playing a lot of
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Sheryl Swoopes and Tina Thompson, alone, were giving the Sparks
all kinds of fits and the Sparks had no solution until late in the
game. Swoopes had 17 of her 26 points in the first half, and
Thompson had 11 of her 17. At one point, those two had more points
(35) than the Sparks total (32) with 11:42 to remaining as the
Sparks trailed 47-32.
</P>
<P>
   But it was just around that time when the momentum shifted from
the Comets to the Sparks, who went on a 26-10 run to take a 59-57
with 1:06 to play.
</P>
<P>
   One big difference came when Tamecka Dixon switched with Mwadi
Mabika to play defense on Swoopes and the change made a big
difference. Dixon came up with a couple of big steals and Mabika
made some big offensive plays. She scored eight her team-high 15
points during the spree, including a three-pointer to tie the game
at 55-55 with 3:04 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Leslie, who struggled with the physical play of the game
and was benched much of the second half for lack of defensive
effort, assisted DeLisha Milton for a layup to give the Sparks the
lead for good (57-55) at the 2:15 mark. Dixon stole the ball from
Swoopes and DeLisha Milton knocked down a 18-foot jumper to make it
a four-point game and the eventual Sparks victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give L.A. credit, they did a great job,'' Houston coach Van
Chancellor said. ``The game got physical They just stepped it up a
notch. The crowd got into the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory pulls the Sparks (17-3) within a game of the
first-place Comets (19-3), whose 10-game win streak was snapped. It
could have been a game to give the Sparks the Western Conference
lead, but the Sparks 12-game win streak was snapped Tuesday by
Portland. Nonetheless, it gives the Sparks a possible home-court
advantage in the playoffs and their first real shot at the WNBA
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they had no idea it would take this type of unusual
game to reach this point.
</P>
<P>
   SPARKS NOTES: The Sparks plays host to Minnesota Lynx today at
7:30 p.m. They defeated the Lynx, 82-75, in their second game of
the season. Minnesota lost Portland Friday 65-54.

HERSHISER APPLAUDS MOVE BY SCIOSCIA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON VERRELL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For just an instant the other night Orel Hershiser
admitted he shed his tried-and-true Dodger Blue for a swatch ---
albeit a small one --- of Angels periwinkle.
</P>
<P>
   It was Thursday night, in the bottom of the 10th inning, when
Mike Scioscia, Hershiser's old batterymate with the Dodgers and now
the Angels' manager, employed the six-man infield.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he did that I said, Yes! Way to go Sosh,''' Hershiser was
saying Friday night at Dodger Stadium before the second game of the
interleague Freeway Series between the Angels and Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to try that,'' Hershiser said, smiling. ``I'm
a ground-ball pitcher. I wanted to do that. But we (the Dodgers)
never did.''
</P>
<P>
   To recap, the Dodgers had the winning run on third base in the
bottom of the 10th inning of a 3-3 tie, only one out and Kevin
Elster at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia brought in his left-handed-throwing left fielder, Darin
Erstad, and stationed him behind the pitcher, just to the shortstop
side of second base.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, of course, from Scioscia's perspective, was not to
lose the game on a roller getting through the infield. Elster
played right into Scioscia's hands when he grounded to Erstad, who
threw out Elster, with an assist from first baseman Mo Vaughn, who
dug Erstad's throw out of the dirt. Score it 7-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can even play shortstop,'' Scioscia said of Erstad, of whom
he said recently, ``He can do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't go entirely the way Scioscia envisioned; the next
batter, Jim Leyritz, drove a ball to right-center and the Angels
lost anyway, 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   But the move, admittedly a daring one inasmuch as it left the
Angels with only two outfielders, only confirmed what Hershiser
already knew: Scioscia is already one heckuva manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very intelligent guy, and someone with great people
skills,'' Hershiser said of Scioscia. I always thought he'd be a
terrific manager . . . if he wanted to. Even when he was playing he
was like a manager on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   What Hershiser --- now retired and awaiting word on just where
he's going to fit into the Dodgers' coaching and instructing scheme
--- meant was that Scioscia routinely called the defensive plays
with runners on base, even occasionally working a hit-and-run on
his own.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, when the Angels evened the current series at a
game apiece, 5-3, Scioscia was again at the forefront.
</P>
<P>
   First, he left his pitcher, Kent Bottenfield, in the game to bat
in the top of the seventh inning even if he hadn't been to the
plate all season and even if the Dodgers were leading at the time,
3-2. Maybe it was Bottenfield's fifth-inning single that swayed the
manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it was,'' said hitting coach Mickey Hatcher.
``I had 14 guys ready to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry. Bottenfield singled. And Darin Erstad followed with the
decisive blow, a two-run homer into the right field seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's his job,'' Erstad said of Scioscia, when asked if he
was surprised Bottenfield was allowed to hit.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia had one more ringer. When Garret Anderson tweaked his
right knee running in the eighth inning, Scioscia replaced him the
next inning in center field with Erstad, and he stationed Orlando
Palmeiro in Erstad's spot in left.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dodgers' ninth, with a runner on first, Erstad made a
remarkable diving catch of a drive to right center by Paul LoDuca.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made a putout at shortstop, he's made a game-saving catch
in center, he plays left field better than anyone in our league,''
Scioscia of Erstad. ``There's nothing this guy hasn't done this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia paused, then smiled and said, ``We could use another
lefty in the bullpen.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Hershiser wouldn't be surprised if Scioscia tried that
one.

OLERUD DELIVERS A `DO-OVER' AGAINST PADRES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN HICKEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Jose Paniagua winced.
</P>
<P>
   He'd been warming up, throwing a ball against a wall in the
bullpen during the top of the sixth inning Friday night at Qualcomm
Stadium, when a throw went awry. The ball flew over his head and
rolled onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   Umpire Jim Wolf saw the loose ball rolling around in right
field, just as San Diego pitcher Brian Weathers prepared to pitch
to John Olerud with one out and two on. Olerud doubled off the
left-field wall and would have driven in the tying run, but Wolf
said his timeout call came first.
</P>
<P>
   Paniagua saw the double and figured he'd be the goat.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get a big hit like that,'' Paniagua said, ``it's not
that easy to get another one.''
</P>
<P>
   It was for Olerud. Told that he had to hit again, he did. He got
in the batter's box and hit Meadows' first pitch, a fastball, hard.
Not for a double this time, and not to left field. Olerud pulled
the ball and jacked it deep into the seats in right-center.
</P>
<P>
   The three-run homer, Olerud's ninth of the year, gave the
Mariners a 4-2 lead and put Seattle ahead to stay. The Mariners won
7-5 and, coupled with Oakland's 4-2 loss to San Francisco, moved
four games ahead of the Athletics in the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   ``That makes Paniagua the MVP of the game,'' closer Kazuhiro
Sasaki said. ``Olerud's really the MVP, but Paniagua is, too.''
</P>
<P>
   What Paniagua mostly is is relieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to get the ball back before anything happened,''
Paniagua said. ``But I didn't and he (Wolf) called time out. And
then we lost the double. After the home run, I was the happiest
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   No happier than Olerud, who would wind up matching his career
high with five RBIs. And certainly no happier than manager Lou
Piniella, who was so upset by Wolf's call that he came close to
getting thrown out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The game was held up for about five minutes while the Mariners,
in the person of Piniella, protested the call. Short of offense
with four regulars not in the lineup, Piniella wanted that run
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been scrambling for runs,'' Piniella said. ``I wanted
that one.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't get it.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud, however, did his manager three better, hitting the next
pitch from Meadows into the seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was standing at second base (after the double), I
didn't know what had happened,'' Olerud said. ``I thought maybe
there'd been some kind of interference or something. I never saw
the umpire call time out, never heard him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you, it's disappointing to lose a big hit,
especially for us with hits tough to get lately. I wasn't happy,
but there's really nothing you can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes there is. You can hit the ball higher and farther and
out of the park, which is the course Olerud ultimately took.
</P>
<P>
   The three-run shot was notable in that it gave the Mariners more
than two runs for the first time in three games. With Alex
Rodriguez, Edgar Martinez, Rickey Henderson and Dan Wilson all out
of the lineup, runs have been exceedingly difficult to come by.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud added a second homer in the eighth inning, going
back-to-back with Mike Cameron as part of a three-run Seattle
uprising. And it had been Olerud who'd started the game's scoring
with a first-inning RBI double _ one that actually counted. It was
his 33rd double, tops in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   The win went to starter Jamie Moyer (9-3), who is 5-0 when
starting a game after a Mariners loss. Moyer went six innings and
pitched out of a couple of jams to keep the Mariners closer until
Olerud could offer the only antidote that would take the pain out
of Wolf's bite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what was going on,'' Moyer said. Told that
Paniagua was the culprit, Moyer broke into a half-grin,
half-grimace. ``I'm glad that things went in our favor. It (the
loose ball) was unfortunate, but to turn out the way things did was
very fortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Piniella was fortunate to be around to see the play.
</P>
<P>
   Denied the tying run and, possibly, the chance for a big inning,
Piniella went nuts. He got in Wolf's face, and when the other three
umps tried to run interference, Piniella did the Seattle sidestep
and went after Wolf again. And again.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf wouldn't change his call, but neither did he throw Piniella
out. It was fortunate for both Piniella and Paniagua that Olerud,
who spent the entire Piniella Pirouette standing on second base,
took the news much more calmly. And it was fortunate for the
Mariners that Wolf didn't start throwing people out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard him call time, and I saw him raise his hands,''
pitching coach Bryan Price said. ``He made the right call.''
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Paniagua made the wrong call.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow, Olerud has to buy me dinner,'' Paniagua said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it should be the other way around. One suspects that
Olerud wouldn't mind paying, even so.
</P>
<P>
   NOTES: Oakland manager Art Howe said that when he set his
rotation to pitch Kevin Appier Friday and Gil Heredia Saturday, it
was so that Appier and Heredia would face the Mariners when Seattle
visits Oakland next Wednesday and Thursday. That should come as no
surprise, since the Mariners' best bets to win, Jamie Moyer Aaron
Sele, are poised to face the A's in those games, which will match
the first- and second-place teams in the West. ... After batting
cleanup Thursday and third Friday, center fielder Mike Cameron now
has started in every spot in the batting order except eighth.

WILLIAMS MAKING AN IMPACT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE WERSTINE  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH _ Shammond Williams made a name for himself in the
NBA last season - with his hair.
</P>
<P>
   Over the first week of the 2000 Summer Pro League, the Seattle
SuperSonics guard is again making a name for himself - but this
time with his prowess on the court.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who averaged just 5.2 points in 43 games for the
Sonics last season, has been arguably the best player at the SPL so
far, scoring nearly 27 points per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to show the people what I am capable of doing,''
said Williams, whose hairstyles - pin curls, corn rolls and Afro -
gave him some notoriety while playing behind the likes of Gary
Payton and Brent Barry. ``I'm just trying to make a name for
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's doing just that as teams are beginning to key on him,
like Dallas did Friday afternoon in a 105-104 victory over Seattle.
The Mavericks' double-teams held Williams, the North Carolina
record-holder in 3-point shooting, to just 25 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no surprise that he's scoring,'' Seattle head coach Paul
Westphal said. ``If he even gets a little look, he can put the ball
in the basket.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who played the entire 48 minutes because of assorted
Sonic injuries, scored 19 points in the first half, then was forced
into passing off the rest of the game, recording most of his six
assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``They double-teamed him, trying to take him out of the game,''
Westphal said. ``But he was able to get other guys involved.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of on-the-floor leadership the Sonics want to
see from Williams, who is shooting 62 percent from the field and 86
percent from the free-throw line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I play with some of the best players in the game and I'm not
the No. 1 option offensively, so I have to show my offense and that
I can run the team,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal, as many others, have been impressed, saying, ``When he
gets his chance (in the NBA), we will do well.''
</P>
<P>
   West end?
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of NBA kinds at the SPL with some kind of link
to Lakers GM - or is that ex-GM? - Jerry West. And most of them
find it hard to believe that West is finally hanging up his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known Jerry since he was a player, watched his whole
career,'' said Lakers longtime assistant coach Bill Bertka. ``Over
the last three years, there have been rumors that he might retire,
and here we are again. It's just a rumor right now and we will have
to wait and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a close relationship over the years and it's too bad
... a loss for the game if it happens,'' said Portland Trail
Blazers coach Mike Dunleavy, whom West gave his first pro head
coaching job in 1990. ``That's his choice, and I support whatever
is best for him. I'm sure he will still be with organization in
some way. They will take care of him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been at it for 40 years,'' said Del Harris, who coached
the Lakers from 1994 to 1998. ``Everybody has to have some time off
and certainly he deserves it. Maybe he will take some time off and
decide to come back.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Alone and heavy-hearted, Ana Maria Ordaz Gonzalez on Friday
prepared for the 27-hour bus trip back to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The death in the desert of her boyfriend, Roberto Arturo Olvera
Morales, had ended her hopes of a better life and decent care for
her sick child.
</P>
<P>
   The two had wandered in the killing heat for two days without
water or clear directions. Olvera Morales became the 73rd person
this year known to have died crossing the Arizona-Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had so many plans, so many illusions,'' Ordaz Gonzalez said
hours before she was to bid farewell to Olvera Morales at a Douglas
funeral home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to get ahead, he wanted to have his own home and a
job,'' she said. ``More than anything, he was thinking of my son.''
</P>
<P>
   The two set off Monday on the last leg of a border crossing they
hoped would eventually take them to jobs in Baltimore. But after
shuffling disoriented in the desert for two days, Olvera Morales,
38, collapsed near Arizona80 just west of Douglas and later died of
heat exposure at a Bisbee hospital.
</P>
<P>
   They were less than five miles north of the barbed-wire fence
that marks the U.S.-Mexican border.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never told me that he was feeling badly,'' Ordaz Gonzalez
said. ``He simply fell, and I couldn't get him to respond. He never
woke up again.''
</P>
<P>
   Ordaz Gonzalez said the two had been planning the trip north
from their hometown of Toluca, near Mexico City, for at least a
month. She said Olvera Morales was hoping to make enough money to
get adequate medical treatment for her 3-year-old son, Jonathan,
who is paralyzed because of a brain hemorrhage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had plans to try to make things better for my boy,'' she
said. ``He wanted to give him better medicine and a better
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Ordaz Gonzalez left the boy with relatives. The two took a bus
to Agua Prieta, across the border from Douglas. A man told them how
to get across the border and assured them he would meet them by
Arizona80 near the town.
</P>
<P>
   They started walking but didn't know the way, according to
Mexican Consul Miguel Escobar Valdez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they were duped,'' Escobar Valdez said. ``There is so
much naivete. They didn't know the directions. They just started
walking.''
</P>
<P>
   Ordaz Gonzalez said they took nothing with them, not even water.
They weren't worried because they thought the walk wouldn't be
long.
</P>
<P>
   But after two days of wandering, Olvera Morales fell ill. Then,
he couldn't breathe. Ordaz Gonzalez tried to revive him. She ran to
the road trying to flag people down, but the cars whisked by.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was running along the highway,'' she said. ``No one wanted
to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a Border Patrol agent stopped and returned to where
Olvera Morales lay unconscious. Rob Daniels, Tucson sector
spokesman, said the agent and his partner used water to cool Olvera
Morales off and succeeded in getting a pulse. But 10 minutes later,
the man stopped breathing again. The agents began CPR, continuing
as an ambulance came and drove Olvera Morales to Copper Queen
Hospital in Bisbee. He was pronounced dead minutes after his
arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Border Patrol officials say 239 people have died this year
trying to cross the U.S.-Mexican border. California's El Centro and
Arizona's Tucson sectors tied for the lead this week, which reached
53 when Olvera Morales died. Daniels said deaths like this are why
the agency has poured planes, helicopters and personnel into the
area in the past few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more, we keep hearing about people who are without
food or water at a fairly close proximity to the border,'' Daniels
said. ``That gives an indication that they have probably traveled
from the interior without any provisions. And they're already in
pretty bad shape when they get to the border.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the deaths keep happening, they're something that
Escobar Valdez never gets used to.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's becoming more common, more typical,'' he says. ``But we
will never get used to human tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, deaths of border crossers in the Arizona sectors have
risen steeply in the past two years. In 1998, 19 border crossers
died in Arizona. In 1999, the figure was 39. Rescues have become a
daily occurrence. Since October1999, agents have rescued almost
1,000 people, up from 600 the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Back home, Olvera Morales worked as a bar manager, one of
several jobs he worked to get ahead, Ordaz Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He worked at everything,'' she said, sobbing. ``He supported
me so much with my son. He was my support and my all.''

   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Sunday, July 16:
</P>
<P>
   INTERNATIONAL
</P>
<P>
   (Coded i)
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-TALKS (Washington) _ While it is impossible to know what
is going on at the negotiating tables at Camp David, the
delegations themselves offer a road map to the process. Israelis,
Palestinians and Americans, their political, military and
diplomatic careers have been interwoven and, in some cases, steered
exclusively toward this goal: the supposed endgame of the
Israeli-Palestinian peace effort and the resolution of 52 years of
conflict. By Deborah Sontag and Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-WEAPONS (Nizhny Tagil, Russia) _ Stung by meager defense
orders from an impoverished army at home, Russia's military
industrial establishment is engaged in a major effort to increase
arms sales to Asia, the Middle East and Africa and is expanding its
share of the lucrative global arms market. By Michael R. Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   SAFRICA-AIDS-ASSESS (Durban, South Africa) _ When the former
South African president Nelson Mandela issued his forceful call for
action to stop the AIDS epidemic that is ravaging his country and
much of the continent, it was a great relief to the 12,500
participants at the 13th international AIDS conference, which ended
here on Friday. They were bitterly disappointed when the current
South African president, Thabo Mbeki, did not acknowledge
forthrightly that HIV causes AIDS, emphasizing instead social
factors like poverty as a major force behind the epidemic. In a
way, however, Mandela's call for immediate action and Mbeki's
emphasis on poverty were making similar points. A news analysis. By
Lawrence K. Altman.
</P>
<P>
   HAITI-ELECTION (Port-au-Prince, Haiti) _ Haitian officials
continued to insist on the legitimacy of their recent parliamentary
and local elections despite warnings from the international
community that foreign aid would be suspended if the Haitian
government installs a new legislature whose members won their seats
through a vote-counting method that has been deemed unfair and
unacceptable. By David Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   CANADA-SRILANKA (Toronto) _ Fund-raising for the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the guerrillas embroiled in the bloody
secessionist war in Sri Lanka, is illegal in the United States. But
Canada has no such prohibition, and Canadian intelligence officials
and Sri Lankan diplomats say it has become an increasingly
important source of support for the Tigers, who are seeking to
carve a Tamil homeland out of Sri Lanka, an island nation off the
southern tip of India. By Somini Sengupta.
</P>
<P>
   CANADA-ABORTION (Yellowknife, Northwest Territories) _ Canada,
traditionally North America's liberal bastion in abortion wars, is
suddenly gripped by a polarizing debate that has gone beyond
ideology to an array of violent attacks and threats. By James
Brooke.
</P>
<P>
   ITALY-BLACK-SOLDIERS (Sommocolonia, Italy) _ The tiny Tuscan
town of Sommocolonia is honoring black American World War II
veterans who heroically defended the town from the Nazis in 1944.
By Alessandra Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   HONGKONG-POLLSTER (Hong Kong) _ In a case that has stoked fears
about academic freedom in this former British colony, a prominent
pollster said on Friday he was warned by the head of Hong Kong
University not to publish surveys critical of the Beijing-appointed
chief executive of Hong Kong. By Mark Landler.
</P>
<P>
   POLITICS
</P>
<P>
   (Coded p)
</P>
<P>
   GORE-CLINTON (Washington) _ At a time when polls show Vice
President Al Gore trailing his Republican rival, Gov. George W.
Bush, in several battleground states, a rising tide of Democrats
contend President Clinton should play a prominent role stumping for
Gore this fall _ even if it reminds voters that he, and not his
protege, remains the party's pre-eminent performer. By James Dao.
</P>
<P>
   GORE-DLC (Baltimore) _ Gore addresses the Democratic Leadership
Council; speech scheduled for 1:30 p.m. By Katharine Q. Seelye.
</P>
<P>
   NATIONAL
</P>
<P>
   (Coded a)
</P>
<P>
   AIRLINE-DELAYS (Undated) _ Last summer was the worst on record
for airline delays, prompting the airlines and the Federal Aviation
Administration to swing into action to try to ease the burden on
weary passengers. Yet despite those efforts, this summer is turning
out to be even worse. By Laurence Zuckerman.
</P>
<P>
   LABS-ASIAN-SCIENTISTS (Undated) _ Asian and Asian-American
scientists are staying away from jobs at national weapons
laboratories, particularly Los Alamos, saying that researchers of
Asian descent are systematically harassed and denied advancement
because of their race. The issue has long simmered at the
laboratories, but it came to a boil last year with the arrest of
Dr. Wen Ho Lee, who is accused of mishandling nuclear secrets at
Los Alamos. Though officials vehemently deny it, many
Asian-Americans said Lee, a naturalized citizen born in Taiwan, was
singled out because of his ethnicity. By James Glanz.
</P>
<P>
   FLA-TOBACCO (Undated) _ Even if cigarette makers succeed in
getting the $145 billion award handed down Friday in Miami sharply
reduced or even thrown out, as many experts expect, the staggering
size of the damage figure _ nearly 30 times higher than the
previous record _ stunned some industry observers. By Barry Meier.
</P>
<P>
   PHILLY-CONVENTION (Philadelphia) _ Before its current downtown
revival and upbeat remake as a major convention site, this city
spent some years indulging the advertising of self-abnegation.
``Philadelphia isn't as bad as Philadelphians say it is,'' went the
slogan, followed by a variety of punch lines about local
attractions. There is soon to be a great test in the form of the
Republican National Convention of whether this city is safely
beyond such gloomy habits of self-promotion. By Francis X. Clines.
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-DOTCOM-RUSH (Nevada City, Calif.) _ In sleepy places like
Sonoma and Nevada City, an old gold rush town in the Sierras, towns
are meeting up uneasily with dotcomers who are moving in. Sonoma
County is struggling with this new trend, and so is Salinas, a farm
town that has seen some explosive growth. Basically, the towns are
being jolted awake and caught off-guard about how to deal with the
dotcomers. By Evelyn Nieves.

`RECKONINGS': WHO'S ACQUIRING WHOM?
</HEADLINE>
 By PAUL KRUGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For those of us who remember the great wave of foreign
investment in the United States between 1986 and 1990, it's
starting to feel like deja vu all over again. Lately hardly a week
goes by without news that yet another American business icon has
become part of a foreign-based corporate empire. Some of the
acquirees are the very companies that in the past tried to use
their all-American identity as a marketing tool. For example, in
the days of Lee Iacocca, Chrysler tried to convince people that
there was something patriotic about buying mediocre cars festooned
with chrome and simulated wood paneling. But now the minivan has
married the Mercedes: Chrysler has become the junior partner in
DaimlerChrysler. Seagram (strictly speaking a Canadian company, but
with its center of gravity well south of the border) is being
absorbed by the French firm Vivendi. And most recently, Union Bank
of Switzerland has announced that it is acquiring PaineWebber _
that symbol of America's belief that it is both possible and good
to become rich.
</P>
<P>
   Yet history is not quite repeating itself. In the 1980s we
reacted badly to the prospect of large-scale foreign ownership of
American companies _ a reaction that was all the sillier because
America had always ridiculed foreigners who expressed similar
concerns about  &UR; our  &LR; multinationals. This time, the American public
seems to be taking foreign investment rather calmly.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the difference may be that Americans just don't
find today's European acquirers as sinister as the Japanese
investors of the '80s. Is this racism? No doubt. But Japan a decade
ago did seem to be playing by its own rules, in a way that the
Europeans don't. (Actually, you do hear occasional complaints about
France that echo what we used to say about Japan _ that while
French companies are free to buy up competitors in Britain or
America, when it comes to things like telecommunications the French
government makes sure that the national team has a home advantage.
But somehow ``France SA'' doesn't sound as scary as ``Japan Inc.'')
</P>
<P>
   Probably more important is that whereas in the 1980s America
seemed to be selling itself to foreign companies out of weakness,
this time foreigners seem to be buying into America because of its
strength. The last foreign investment boom began after the dollar
plunged against the yen and Europe's currencies in 1985-86; this
made American investments look cheap, especially to Japanese
companies whose stocks sold at the time at multiples worthy of a
millennial dot-com. (Only later would the Japanese realize that
this was the era of the ``bubble economy.'') Now, of course, the
dollar is strong and so are U.S. stocks _ though the Europeans seem
to be buying mainly companies whose valuations are not that far out
of line with tradition.
</P>
<P>
   So why are the Europeans buying? Partly because America, with
its amazing ``new economy,'' is where the growth prospects are. And
partly also because the foreign buyers hope that they are buying
not just bricks and mortar but also know-how, that they can take a
bit of that new economy back to headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   And that is surely the really big difference between today and
the late 1980s. It's hard to believe now, but a decade ago America
was afflicted with severe self-doubt. These days we are so
self-confident that, like Chinese conquered by barbarians in
centuries past, we tend to assume that in a very short time our new
rulers will be assimilated _ that a foreign firm that acquires a
big chunk of corporate America will soon be an American firm in all
but name. After all, hasn't DaimlerChrysler decided to adopt
English as its corporate language? (And Vivendi _ sacre bleu! _
intends to do the same.)
</P>
<P>
   So it's possible that the public acceptance of this new wave of
foreign investment is mainly just a matter of complacency _ that we
are currently so full of ourselves that we feel that in effect we
are acquiring them, not the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   But I'd like to think that there's more going on here than good
old-fashioned American arrogance. We are a more sophisticated
nation than we used to be _ better traveled and more aware of the
world outside. And maybe, just maybe, we are even sophisticated
enough to understand and accept the idea that globalization is a
two-way street.

`LIBERTIES': THE $7 MILLION MAN 
</HEADLINE>
  By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I ask Jack Welch what could possibly make his book worth $7.1
million.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any sex in it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Very little,'' he says, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Authors used to be lavished with money for writing scintillating
love scenes. But the Valley of the Dolls has been replaced by the
Silicon Valley of the dot-coms. The sexiest thing in America is no
longer sex. It's money.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Harry Potter had to make room for some adult
fantasies: not about conjuring up pin cushions from hedgehogs, but
about conjuring up cash _ lots and lots of cash.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the literature of lucre, the Bildungsroman of the bottom
line. First Random House gave Robert Rubin, the investment banker
and former treasury secretary who masterminded the new culture of
wealth, $3.3 million for his story. Then Time Warner ponied up $7.1
million to Welch, the chairman of GE, who has been described by
Fortune Magazine as ``the leading management revolutionary of the
century.''
</P>
<P>
   Welch's book auction broke the record for a nonfiction book. It
was $4 million more than Paula Barbieri got for describing life
with O.J., and half a million or so more than either Colin Powell
got for his heroic saga or the pope got for writing about
spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   Welch, raised in a good Irish Catholic family in Salem, Mass.,
was a little embarrassed that he trumped the pope.
</P>
<P>
   Calling Friday night from the locker room after a golf
tournament, he confided: ``I got an e-mail from a friend about the
bidding that said, `You should have cut it short at the pope. Now
you're dead. Didn't your altar boy days teach you that?'''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Welch _ who says he will give all the earnings from
his book to charity _ did have the same agent as the pope. His
literary agent was Mark Reiter at Mark McCormack's International
Management Group. McCormack, a prominent sports agent, handled the
promotion of some of the pope's trips abroad.
</P>
<P>
   We may have a numbing presidential contest between a couple of
beta males, two pampered scions of famous families whose paths were
laid out for them.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Neutron Jack'' is ready to spill all his alpha secrets.
``This guy is the Vince Lombardi of business,'' says John Huey, the
Fortune editor. The stock price of GE from the time the 64-year-old
took over the company 20 years ago is a vertiginous vertical line
that has made him the most widely aped and studied executive in the
land.
</P>
<P>
   Publishers, who see the pilots of the new turbo-charged economy
as the hot celebrities, are clearly hoping for another Iacocca.
</P>
<P>
   Welch says he hopes his Scout's-oath style of advice will be
uplifting _ ``Be true to yourself, be honest with others, say what
you think, go with your instincts, teach people that you can
stretch and grow in ways you never thought possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a dinner party with 12 people. You bring as many
intellects together as you can and then take the best ideas out of
each. The leader who gets the most ideas from the most sources will
have the most success.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as Bob Rubin has been mentioned as a Democratic
vice-presidential prospect, Donald Trump used to say he might have
chosen Jack Welch.
</P>
<P>
   But Welch, who says he is ``a Republican fiscally but a Democrat
on many social issues,'' demurs. ``I don't touch politics,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``In government, the best ideas don't always win. The president
has to deal with Congress. In government, you're always
compromising. You sell out on some principle and get something else
for it. In business, you're not. You can be totally free. In a
company, we have the luxury of being able to remove values we don't
like.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not worried about the dot-com bubble bursting. ``I think
we've handled the shakeout quite well,'' he says. ``There's no new
economy. It's the same old economy with new technology. We get rid
of some of the numbing, boring jobs and make society better and
more creative.''
</P>
<P>
   He rejects the notion that our national fixation on money and
easy millions is unhealthy. He thinks America has grown more like
the earnest '50s _ when housewives were snapping up GE's
new-fangled appliances _ than the greed-is-good '80s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The young kids we're hiring today are focused and excited,''
he says. ``They believe in hard work and giving back to the
community and in having balanced lives. I don't see more greed or
less greed now. A lot of people have participated in this market.
It's not confined to a narrow group of fat cats. The boats have
risen everywhere.''

AFRICA'S AIDS CRISIS: FINDING COMMON GROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa _ When former South African president
Nelson Mandela issued his forceful call for action to stop the AIDS
epidemic ravaging his country and much of the continent, it was a
great relief to the 12,500 participants at the 13th international
AIDS conference, which ended here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting in the most-infected province of the most-infected
country on the most-infected continent, they were bitterly
disappointed when the current South African president, Thabo Mbeki,
did not acknowledge forthrightly that HIV causes AIDS, emphasizing
instead social factors like poverty as a major force behind the
epidemic. In a way, however, Mandela's call for immediate action
and Mbeki's emphasis on poverty were making similar points.
</P>
<P>
   For while a virus causes AIDS, social conditions feed the
epidemic. Patterns of behavior _ fed by poverty, ignorance and
despair _ have resulted in a disease so widespread that it has left
millions of orphans and threatens to destroy much of Africa's
economy and to wipe out a generation of young people.
</P>
<P>
   But what is implicit in the remarks of both Mbeki and Mandela is
the idea that some AIDS problems can be attacked now, even without
the vaccines and cures that have yet to emerge from laboratories in
the developed world.
</P>
<P>
   Just 10 miles from the plush surroundings of the conference
center, many South Africans live in squatter camps and earn meager
incomes as migrant workers. As they have traveled seeking jobs in
mines and other industries, they have brought HIV home to their
families to fuel what has become an explosive epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela cited two African countries, Uganda and Senegal. The
first turned around a major epidemic of AIDS. The second prevented
a small one from becoming larger. Those successes, using relatively
inexpensive public health tools like education, suggest that other
countries severely affected by HIV might do as well, if they can
only muster the political will to act.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela challenged the world to focus on what health workers
know works in preventing AIDS. Though the use of drugs to prevent
transmission of the virus from mothers to infants is mandatory in
any HIV control plan, Mandela said, ``Promoting abstinence, safe
sex and the use of condoms and ensuring the early treatment of
sexually transmitted diseases are some of the steps needed and
about which there can be no dispute.''
</P>
<P>
   These are steps that could be carried out immediately and at a
relatively low cost.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the conference, other participants stressed similar
steps, the kind of old-fashioned public health work that has shown
good, if not spectacular, results.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Dr. Hoosen M. Coovadia, a leading AIDS expert in
Durban and the conference chairman, cited the way political and
religious leaders from diverse parts of Uganda and Senegal spoke
out about AIDS, both to reduce the stigma of the disease and to
encourage counseling, testing and the aggressive promotion of
condom use.
</P>
<P>
   The results have been encouraging. Uganda's infection rates have
dropped to 8 percent from 14 percent in the early 1990s, according
to U.N. statistics for the most recent years available. Rates in
Senegal, where the country's then-president, Abdou Diouf, began
speaking out forcefully more than a decade ago, have stayed below 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where prostitution is legal, Senegalese health
officials have set up free clinics to treat sexually transmitted
infections, and have organized a vigorous education campaign on the
virus.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela also pointed to Thailand, which acted relatively quickly
to set up an aggressive program to offer condoms and treat sexually
transmitted diseases, which enhance the spread of the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   Thailand was one of the first countries to commit its own
resources to fight the epidemic, said Dr. Helene Gayle, who directs
the HIV program for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC worked with Thailand to set up sophisticated infection
surveillance systems that allowed it to track the path of its
epidemic. Thailand used the systems to respond quickly when it
spotted rising HIV rates in specific areas.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, South Africa, which at the start of the epidemic
had a relatively low infection rate, is now seeking ways to help an
estimated 20 percent of adults infected with the virus. Because few
have access to tests for the virus, most are ignorant of their
condition. And almost none have access to the drugs that have
helped control the infection in richer countries.
</P>
<P>
   The AIDS epidemic is ``depleting health services and robbing
schools of both students and teachers'' as it undermines the
country's economy, Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
   And Zola Skweyiya, the South African minister of welfare and
population development, was quoted in the nation's newspapers as
offering an even more drastic assessment: If the AIDS trend goes
unabated, South Africa could eventually revert to a white majority.
</P>
<P>
   In South Africa, HIV rates rose slowly during apartheid and
surged late in Mandela's presidency and during Mbeki's first year
in office. In the last two years, they have risen by more than 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela acknowledged that HIV flourished when it could have been
prevented. Now, he said he is instructing his private foundation to
consult experts about the best way to conduct anti-HIV campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Though the meeting was held in Africa to encourage the world's
AIDS experts and government leaders to focus on the dire conditions
here, participants looked beyond the continent, repeatedly calling
on leaders of countries elsewhere to show the political will to
beat AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   They cited the rapidly worsening epidemic of HIV in Russia and
voiced particular concern about the threat to the world's most
populous countries, India and China.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the emphasis on public health efforts stems from the
belief that the drugs that have greatly improved life for AIDS
patients in the developed world are out of reach of the third
world's poor.
</P>
<P>
   But UNAIDS, a joint U.N. agency, and five drug companies are
negotiating steep drops in the price of AIDS drugs for Africa and
other poor regions afflicted by the disease. For example, the
German company Behringer-Ingelheim announced that it would offer an
anti-HIV drug, nevirapine, free for five years for the prevention
of mother-to-child transmission in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   Still, health officials at the conference stressed that lowering
prices is only part of the battle. For example, the combination
drug therapies used extensively in rich countries require testing
for HIV, measuring the level of the virus in the blood, and
preventing and dealing with the complications that often occur with
such therapy _ much of which is beyond the health care
infrastructure in the third world.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stefan Vella, the president of the group that organizes the
AIDS conferences, warned of ``the dangers of parachuting drugs''
into countries that have no health infrastructure because ``you may
do more harm than good.''
</P>
<P>
   In education efforts about the basic facts of AIDS, a major goal
will be to destroy widespread myths in Africa. One is that having
sex with a virgin will cure AIDS, a belief that often leads to
violence and rape, said Dr. Zweli Mkhize, the health minister of
KwaZulu/Natal province.
</P>
<P>
   But the educational programs will not be effective unless they
focus on men, said Dr. William M. Makgoba, the head of the South
African equivalent of the U.S. National Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always target young females,'' Makgoba said. Instead, he
urged, efforts must be made to educate men about how risky sexual
practices spread the virus and that, overall, men have done more
than women to spread the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Coovadia said that the meeting he led provided a range of
options for governments to make decisions about how to combat AIDS,
but that it was up to them to carry out those policies.
</P>
<P>
   That will not be easy. ``Anybody who claims they have a simple
solution for such a complex problem is either naive or a liar,''
said Dr. Peter Piot, the director of UNAIDS.

   Book critics can be a pompous, self-important lot. Many people
gripe that they are out of touch with the common reader and that
their highfalutin academic tastes have no relation to what the
masses might enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   As with every other aspect of modern life, the Internet _
specifically Amazon.com _ has leveled the literary playing field.
The Web site's customers can review books and post their critiques,
and thousands of them have tapped out their thoughts and donated
them to the digital universe. (Amazon even ranks its most prolific
critics, with the current No. 1 spot held by a former librarian,
Harriet Klausner, who at last count had weighed in on 545 titles.)
</P>
<P>
   In addition to taking best sellers and popular pulp to task,
many of these unpaid arbiters of literary greatness feel it is
their duty to take a crack at the classics.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; James Joyce's ``Ulysses'' is often hailed as the greatest novel of
the 20th century, but many cybercritics are not so charitable:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   (``Ulysses'' is) a babbling, senseless tome upheld by ``literary
luminaries'' who fear being cast into the tasteless bourgeois
darkness for dissent. Joyce rambles and, moreover, Joyce doesn't
say a blessed thing (save what literary critics assign him but
that's what literary critics do: They find profundity _ not to
mention the occasional phallic symbol _ in the midst of absolutely
nothing.) The poor trees who gave their lives that Ulysses might
gather dust on countless shelves would have been put to nobler use
as toothpicks.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Even the ``Odyssey'' has its detractors: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   There is no other word than awful. For school, we had to read
this book, and I was kind of excited, I think Greek mythology is
very interesting. I knew that it would be somewhat of a challenge,
knowing it was poetry and since it was assigned in my Honors
English class. Now that we are done with the book, I am forced to
write a five-page paper on it. All that I can possibly say is that
it bored me and I could not even finish it, because it was not
written a way that you could understand it. I am warning you if you
like to waste your time you should read this book, otherwise stay
clear!
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Young people and students who have been forced to read the classics
are among the most impassioned critics. Here's one take on ``War
and Peace'':  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Im 11, thatas probably why i really dont like the book, but my
point made is, my mom grounded me and made me read war and peace,
and it was the worst punistment i have ever been through, i asked
my family to read a page of it, and they all fell asleep, sorry to
all the people who like it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Online reviewers, like their professional brethren, can have wildly
divergent points of view, as in these two entries on ``The Catcher
in the Rye'':  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   I love to read it. I love to just sit down and let this book
take me on an adventure through the mind of one young man, Holden
V. Caulfield, as he manages to reveal tremendous truths about,
well, about just about everything. Congress should pass a law
requiring everyone to read this book at least once and maybe twice.
No joke.
</P>
<P>
   I entered into this book expecting the timeless classic everyone
talks about. But . . . the writing is so-so, the story is a bore,
the characters are dated and the twists are so overly perfect that
it couldn't be real life. The connections Salinger makes throughout
the story are so obvious and forced that it made me want to laugh,
I could write better then this. A complete waste of an hour!
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Flashes of intellectual arrogance and snobbery come with the
territory. Even ``Macbeth'' is not immune to the baleful gaze of
one reviewer:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Having researched great authors as part of my Ph.D. at
Princeton, it is surprising how poorly Shakespeare has written this
particular book. The plot is weak and lacks imagination, the
character development is all over the shop and writing style is
quite muddled in places. Interesting read though!
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Inevitably, some literati play it for laughs:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   While Nabokov's literary gymnastics are impressive, the overall
experience of reading ``Lolita'' is an empty one. You're better off
listening to the audio version (narrated by Liberace) or watching
the Disney cartoon musical featuring the voices of Val Kilmer, Anna
Paquin and Red Auerbach.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; No title is out of bounds for critical appraisal. Consider this
rave for one classic (whose average grade on Amazon.com, by the
way, is 4{ out of 5 stars).  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   What can I say about the Bible? The greatest book ever, it is
more than a book. If you buy one book EVER, this is the one.
Nonbelievers need to read this in any form. I don't want to spoil
the end, but let's just say YOU NEED TO READ THIS BOOK AS SOON AS
POSSIBLE.

LAWMAKERS IN THE MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Week in Review) 
(NOTE TO INTERNATIONAL CLIENTS: For use by special arrangement
only. Asian and European points: Call Karl Horwitz in Paris for
details and prices, phone: 47 42 17 11; fax: 47-42-80-44.) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It is the new risk for the politician in this new
economy: Lawmakers who actively invest are discovering that their
stock portfolios have become yet another area of their personal
lives that is vulnerable to attack.
</P>
<P>
   In years past, scandals were fueled by a public official's
indiscretions, either sexual (like adultery) or financial (like
bribery), and the consequences were rarely in doubt. Today, a
scandal can be set off by vaguer questions about the propriety of a
politician's use of complex financial transactions.
</P>
<P>
   The public cannot always agree on what the consequences should
be for politicians who used their position to get a taste of a
particularly sweet IPO. Often, it is almost impossible to determine
whether their market moves have crossed an ethical or legal line.
Yet on the national stage there is a growing crowd of
investor-politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert G. Torricelli, D-N.J., behaving at times like a day
trader, bought and sold stocks more than 100 times last year.
During one frenzied week, Torricelli dipped in and out of a
basketful of high-technology stocks, owning shares of DrKoop.com
and Novell for a matter of hours. Critics have accused Torricelli
of parlaying his connections to corporate leaders to make
investments that have paid off handsomely.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rick Lazio, the New York Republican now running for the
Senate, purchased stock options in the Quick &AMP; Reilly brokerage
firm in August 1997. Days later, the company announced it was
seeking a buyer, its stock price soared and Lazio's first-ever
options investment netted him a 600 percent profit. The Securities
and Exchange Commission is investigating whether he violated
insider trader laws.
</P>
<P>
   Both Torricelli and Lazio say they have done nothing wrong, and
there is no evidence either man did anything illegal, or violated
any congressional ethics rules.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Ralph Nader, who is the Green Party presidential
nominee, disclosed that he owns $1.2 million worth of stock in
Cisco Systems, one of many technology companies in his portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress _ and even Nader, an outspoken critic of
corporate wealth and power _ are pursuing personal fortunes in the
market with as much zeal as many of their constituents. The
question is whether those successes are the product of good timing,
savvy or something else.
</P>
<P>
   Government scholars and former lawmakers are increasingly
questioning whether aggressive investing by elected officials is
appropriate behavior since politicians are often privy to corporate
secrets. And a politician's own action or inaction on legislation
can easily move individual stocks and even whole markets.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Simon, the former Illinois senator, said lawmakers have so
much access to inside information that only their own
``self-restraint'' guards against any urge to use the information
when making personal investment decisions. ``I suspected that it
was happening while I was in the Senate,'' said Simon, who left the
Senate in 1997. ``I think this is going to be a growing abuse if we
don't put up some safeguards.''
</P>
<P>
   The safeguard mentioned most often is a blind trust, in which a
professional manages stocks, shielding their identity from the
holder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a real purist, and I believe that when people move into
the Senate or the House, they ought to put everything they own in a
blind trust,'' said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg
School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and past presidents have used blind trusts, as
have some senators and House members. But in recent years, a
greater number of members of Congress have actively bought and sold
individual stocks. Some enter the Senate already rich, but scholars
wonder how many become millionaires while serving there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our elected officials are in a position to influence stock
prices and get special access to information that is potentially
useful to their personal interests,'' said Jamieson, who wrote
``Everything You Think You Know About Politics _ And Why You're
Wrong'' (Basic Books, 2000). ``And you don't want them to make
public policy decisions about something they have a self-interest
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli, one of the Senate's most active stock traders, has
not been accused of that, but he has taken advantage of
opportunities not generally available to the investing public,
which has raised issues about whether the favor givers will want
something in return. For example, the senator invested $5,000 last
year in an Internet startup named e.Volve and the value of his
stock skyrocketed to $225,000 within a few months.
</P>
<P>
   In Lazio's case, he bought stock and options in Quick &AMP; Reilly,
whose top executives were major contributors to his past campaigns.
Some of them also served as executives of the Securities Industry
Association, which actively lobbies the House Subcommittee on
Finance, on which Lazio serves; the congressional group has
jurisdiction over many issues directly affecting the brokerage
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Self-enrichment is not a new trend in politics. But the recent
explosion in stock trading has provided many more opportunities for
it. Pork is an old tradition, with legislators delivering rich
contracts to their districts. In rare cases, some make money in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers are steeped in inside information. If they don't hear
stock tips in the executive session of a committee meeting, they
can pick them up after hours at fund-raising events, where wealthy
corporate leaders often speak freely about their businesses.
</P>
<P>
   But it is one thing to hear the tips and quite another to act on
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We first noticed this during the health care debate in 1994,''
said Charles Lewis, the executive director of the Center for Public
Integrity. ``Forty members of the five key committees all had
health care stocks, and some were selling and buying stocks during
the markup session.'' The best safeguard to such behavior, Lewis
argued, is public outrage and the vigilance of watchdogs and
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress are required to file annual financial
disclosure forms listing their assets and debts. The forms, though,
provide the haziest of pictures because lawmakers need only list
their assets according to very wide ranges, from $2,001 to $15,000,
for example. When the information is released each June,
journalists write brief reports summarizing the net worths of the
wealthiest senators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average American does have a right to know that their
lawmaker is basically a day trader,'' Lewis said. ``Most people who
watch the Hill closely believe this happens, and I'm one of those
people. I think lawmakers have made money from their inside
knowledge of the inner workings of government. But I can't prove
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another problem with such matters is their complexity. The
Clintons' Whitewater land deal, for example, was so complicated
that very few Americans understood it; most Americans' response was
probably shaped by the fact that the Clintons lost money. The real
estate deal seems quaint when compared with politicians'
participation today in highly intricate transactions. Hillary
Rodham Clinton's $100,000 profit in the commodities market was
easier to grasp, but failed to enrage most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone seems to be doing well in the market, and everyone
hears stock tips,'' said Joel Silbey, a professor of history at
Cornell University. ``In this atmosphere, why should any of the
elected officials who are doing it really worry that their actions
might affect them adversely on election day?''
</P>
<P>
   James Carville, the Democratic consultant, said there is only
one way to curb the potential for legislators to use inside
information to enhance their investment portfolios. ``But the
public will never agree with it,'' Carville cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer is to pay them more salary, pay them $300,000 a
year,'' he said. ``And make it mandatory that all their investments
go in a blind trust. The cheapest thing is to pay them some real
money, and take away the temptation to do something wrong.''

   WASHINGTON _ It is the new risk for the politician in this new
economy: Lawmakers who actively invest are discovering that their
stock portfolios have become yet another area of their personal
lives that is vulnerable to attack.
</P>
<P>
   In years past, scandals were fueled by a public official's
indiscretions, either sexual (like adultery) or financial (like
bribery), and the consequences were rarely in doubt. Today, a
scandal can be set off by vaguer questions about the propriety of a
politician's use of complex financial transactions.
</P>
<P>
   The public cannot always agree on what the consequences should
be for politicians who used their position to get a taste of a
particularly sweet IPO. Often, it is almost impossible to determine
whether their market moves have crossed an ethical or legal line.
Yet on the national stage there is a growing crowd of
investor-politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert G. Torricelli, D-N.J., behaving at times like a day
trader, bought and sold stocks more than 100 times last year.
During one frenzied week, Torricelli dipped in and out of a
basketful of high-technology stocks, owning shares of DrKoop.com
and Novell for a matter of hours. Critics have accused Torricelli
of parlaying his connections to corporate leaders to make
investments that have paid off handsomely.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rick Lazio, the New York Republican now running for the
Senate, purchased stock options in the Quick &AMP; Reilly brokerage
firm in August 1997. Days later, the company announced it was
seeking a buyer, its stock price soared and Lazio's first-ever
options investment netted him a 600 percent profit. The Securities
and Exchange Commission is investigating whether he violated
insider trader laws.
</P>
<P>
   Both Torricelli and Lazio say they have done nothing wrong, and
there is no evidence either man did anything illegal, or violated
any congressional ethics rules.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Ralph Nader, who is the Green Party presidential
nominee, disclosed that he owns $1.2 million worth of stock in
Cisco Systems, one of many technology companies in his portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress _ and even Nader, an outspoken critic of
corporate wealth and power _ are pursuing personal fortunes in the
market with as much zeal as many of their constituents. The
question is whether those successes are the product of good timing,
savvy or something else.
</P>
<P>
   Government scholars and former lawmakers are increasingly
questioning whether aggressive investing by elected officials is
appropriate behavior since politicians are often privy to corporate
secrets. And a politician's own action or inaction on legislation
can easily move individual stocks and even whole markets.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Simon, the former Illinois senator, said lawmakers have so
much access to inside information that only their own
``self-restraint'' guards against any urge to use the information
when making personal investment decisions. ``I suspected that it
was happening while I was in the Senate,'' said Simon, who left the
Senate in 1997. ``I think this is going to be a growing abuse if we
don't put up some safeguards.''
</P>
<P>
   The safeguard mentioned most often is a blind trust, in which a
professional manages stocks, shielding their identity from the
holder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a real purist, and I believe that when people move into
the Senate or the House, they ought to put everything they own in a
blind trust,'' said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg
School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and past presidents have used blind trusts, as
have some senators and House members. But in recent years, a
greater number of members of Congress have actively bought and sold
individual stocks. Some enter the Senate already rich, but scholars
wonder how many become millionaires while serving there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our elected officials are in a position to influence stock
prices and get special access to information that is potentially
useful to their personal interests,'' said Jamieson, who wrote
``Everything You Think You Know About Politics _ And Why You're
Wrong'' (Basic Books, 2000). ``And you don't want them to make
public policy decisions about something they have a self-interest
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli, one of the Senate's most active stock traders, has
not been accused of that, but he has taken advantage of
opportunities not generally available to the investing public,
which has raised issues about whether the favor givers will want
something in return. For example, the senator invested $5,000 last
year in an Internet startup named e.Volve and the value of his
stock skyrocketed to $225,000 within a few months.
</P>
<P>
   In Lazio's case, he bought stock and options in Quick &AMP; Reilly,
whose top executives were major contributors to his past campaigns.
Some of them also served as executives of the Securities Industry
Association, which actively lobbies the House Subcommittee on
Finance, on which Lazio serves; the congressional group has
jurisdiction over many issues directly affecting the brokerage
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Self-enrichment is not a new trend in politics. But the recent
explosion in stock trading has provided many more opportunities for
it. Pork is an old tradition, with legislators delivering rich
contracts to their districts. In rare cases, some make money in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers are steeped in inside information. If they don't hear
stock tips in the executive session of a committee meeting, they
can pick them up after hours at fund-raising events, where wealthy
corporate leaders often speak freely about their businesses.
</P>
<P>
   But it is one thing to hear the tips and quite another to act on
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We first noticed this during the health care debate in 1994,''
said Charles Lewis, the executive director of the Center for Public
Integrity. ``Forty members of the five key committees all had
health care stocks, and some were selling and buying stocks during
the markup session.'' The best safeguard to such behavior, Lewis
argued, is public outrage and the vigilance of watchdogs and
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress are required to file annual financial
disclosure forms listing their assets and debts. The forms, though,
provide the haziest of pictures because lawmakers need only list
their assets according to very wide ranges, from $2,001 to $15,000,
for example. When the information is released each June,
journalists write brief reports summarizing the net worths of the
wealthiest senators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average American does have a right to know that their
lawmaker is basically a day trader,'' Lewis said. ``Most people who
watch the Hill closely believe this happens, and I'm one of those
people. I think lawmakers have made money from their inside
knowledge of the inner workings of government. But I can't prove
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another problem with such matters is their complexity. The
Clintons' Whitewater land deal, for example, was so complicated
that very few Americans understood it; most Americans' response was
probably shaped by the fact that the Clintons lost money. The real
estate deal seems quaint when compared with politicians'
participation today in highly intricate transactions. Hillary
Rodham Clinton's $100,000 profit in the commodities market was
easier to grasp, but failed to enrage most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone seems to be doing well in the market, and everyone
hears stock tips,'' said Joel Silbey, a professor of history at
Cornell University. ``In this atmosphere, why should any of the
elected officials who are doing it really worry that their actions
might affect them adversely on election day?''
</P>
<P>
   James Carville, the Democratic consultant, said there is only
one way to curb the potential for legislators to use inside
information to enhance their investment portfolios. ``But the
public will never agree with it,'' Carville cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer is to pay them more salary, pay them $300,000 a
year,'' he said. ``And make it mandatory that all their investments
go in a blind trust. The cheapest thing is to pay them some real
money, and take away the temptation to do something wrong.''

<P>
   ``Where Have All the Footnotes Gone?'' the historian Gertrude
Himmelfarb asked in a 1991 essay.(1) At that point, footnotes lucky
enough to survive at all had moved to the backs of books and turned
into less scrutinized endnotes. Annotation was out; breezy,
uninterrupted prose was in.
</P>
<P>
   At around the same time that historians were getting upset at
the decline of footnotes in journals and books, a physicist felt
there had to be a way to improve the referencing system on the
Internet. Instead of just getting upset, Tim Berners-Lee did
something about it: He created the World Wide Web, writing the
world's first browser and releasing his software as open-source
code in 1991.(2)
</P>
<P>
   Soon the missing footnotes would have a home.
</P>
<P>
   The reading process mourned by scholars who thought footnotes
superior to endnotes _ who preferred the process of interruption,
midstream re-evaluation and jumping around _ is the natural process
of reading on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Small children who would normally not read books with footnotes
until secondary school know their way around bright blue
hyperlinks.(3) They learn early that a Web site isn't complete
without references to other sites, and that the cooler the site,
the cooler its links.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed the Web has not only revived the footnote but also
spawned a cross-referencing craze that renders the formerly
complete media event into a reference-laden, link-dependent,
list-spewing wallflower waiting to be courted by the next available
annotator.
</P>
<P>
   Television shows, newspaper articles and radio programs refer to
Web sites, and those sites in turn refer to books, magazines and
software. Networks like MSNBC have even asked viewers to watch
television and the Internet simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   The original glorious goal of such cross-referencing was hip
media convergence: The actual result is fans running from the
living room to the den in a frustrated effort to view the computer
and television at the same time. One newspaper, The South Carolina
Post-Courier, now publishes hyperlinks _ not just Web addresses but
actual bar codes that readers can scan using laser pens provided by
the newspaper and, yes, attached to their PCs.
</P>
<P>
   In the old-media world, the question was how to get the audience
to stay with you. In the new-media world, it is how to get the
audience to leave and come back again. After all, it is not
readability that makes for greatness on the Web: It is
clickability.
</P>
<P>
   Obeying the Cartesian principle of new media _ ``I link,
therefore I am'' _ the popular search engine Google ranks its
results by popularity, measured in quantities of links. The best
sites, then, are the ones most often cited.
</P>
<P>
   Citing is a kind way of putting it _ it can also be rehashing.
It can be cannibalizing. Or, in the case of recent copyright
disputes, stealing.
</P>
<P>
   There are entire publications on the Web that are just indexes
of other publications. The review Arts &AMP; Letters Daily, for
example, culls entertaining articles from a wide variety of
newspapers and magazines.(4) Its originality lies in its extremely
clickable headlines and in its rearrangement of already published
materials.
</P>
<P>
   In a realm where an index is hailed as a publication, the
pressure to be original is outweighed by the heavier pressure to be
well connected. Some of the connections grew out of strategic
alliances between visionary new-media companies and terrified
old-media companies. But since many 12-year-olds know enough html
to create hyperlinks between sites, much cross-referencing has
arrived unannounced, raising questions about the right to link.
</P>
<P>
   A daily Internet newspaper, The Shetland News, published
headlines that linked directly to stories in the electronic version
of the weekly newspaper The Shetland Times, without mentioning the
source. The News used ``deep links,'' connecting to the articles
themselves and bypassing the competition's home page. The Shetland
Times sued for copyright infringement. The parties reached a
settlement that called for a redesign of the links.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, cyberlaw was in its infancy, and anything seemed
possible. A site operated by Total News Inc. had no original
content, just links to 1,350 news outlets.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, The Washington Post, Time Inc., CNN, Reuters New Media,
the owners of the Los Angeles Times, and the owners of The Wall
Street Journal sued Total News, a five-person operation in Phoenix,
over multiple copyright and trademark violations. The attorneys for
the plaintiffs called Total News a ``parasitic Web site.''
</P>
<P>
   In the settlement, Total News was prohibited from using
``frames,'' a technology that did make its site look particularly
parasitic: CNN or Reuters items would pop up, conveniently bordered
by the Total News logo and ads. Like deep links, frames can make
another site seem like your own. Such connecting devices don't
merely link; they also claim credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inline'' linking runs even deeper, bringing information inside
a site. In 1996, a graduate student at Princeton, Dan Wallach, used
this technique to import the daily Dilbert comic strip to his home
page. United Media, which syndicates the strip, threatened to sue,
and he removed it.
</P>
<P>
   Wallach argued that he had designed the page so that the
company's content did not reside permanently on his server, and
that if he was guilty of copyright infringement, so was any search
engine. He wrote to the syndicate's attorney, ``Technically, I
present a directory of pointers in much the same way as Yahoo,
Lycos or Alta Vista.''(5)
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's hard to imagine an intellectual-property lawsuit
against one of those engines. But smaller search engines have come
under attack, just as hyperlinking has, for ``pointing'' to
copyrighted material in currently pending cases in the film and
music industries.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Link suits have proved legally complex, involving claims of
false advertising, misappropriation, fair use and the hyperlink's
friend, the First Amendment. They have also proved morally complex,
raising questions of originality, and of whether pointing to
another's work can be a work in itself.
</P>
<P>
   An imaginatively hyperlinked site should ideally have the beauty
of a collage, or at least of a gallery exhibit. Its references
should resonate the way good literary allusions do _ even more so,
because literary references speak to an elite readership, while
cyberallusions are for everybody.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, they are so universally accessible that the lines
between allusion and authorship, between curating and creating, can
become blurred. Problems arise when the curators see themselves as
artists, or worse, when they hang other people's art in their own
galleries without permission.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, it is only huge Big Brother-like corporations that wield
enough clout to prosecute creative plagiarists and defend the
individual creator, often making cyberpirates seem like sympathetic
underdogs.
</P>
<P>
   On the Web, artworks can be summoned by the push of a button,
much the way the hero makes paintings appear in his mansion in the
movie ``The Thomas Crown Affair,'' but without the bother of
building trick walls or breaking into the Metropolitan Museum.
Those who push the buttons online are considered not international
art thieves but designers and entrepreneurs; and there collecting
aspires to be an art.
</P>
<P>
   The decline of originality may not be illegal, but it is
upsetting. You don't have to go far to find an unauthorized copy of
Gertrude Himmelfarb's essay on the Web: A quick search, and there
it is, electronic reprint rights presumably not paid, linked to a
syllabus.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the missing footnotes have resurfaced, scholars have
other things to worry about.

   NIZHNY TAGIL, Russia _ Stung by meager defense orders from an
impoverished army at home, Russia's military industrial
establishment is engaged in a major effort to increase arms sales
to Asia, the Middle East and Africa and is expanding its share of
the lucrative global arms market.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and western Europe dominate the international
weapons bazaar. But last week, on a once-secret test range in the
Ural mountains, the men who fashioned the formidable arsenal that
once made NATO anxious and was paraded with pride by the Kremlin
each May Day showed that they could attract plenty of customers _
and had plenty to sell, too.
</P>
<P>
   Defense officials from India and China _ Russia's major
customers for weapons _ Kuwait, North Korea, South Korea and dozens
of other nations watched attentively as a T-90 tank, one of
Russia's newest weapons, sent a laser-guided missile streaking
toward a target more than two miles away. South Korean officials
kept a watchful eye on any weapons that piqued North Korean
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Baton-twirling majorettes paraded along the range's esplanade as
Russian officials toasted their guests from vodka bottles bearing
the imprint of a Russian tank. And Mikhail Kalashnikov, the
80-year-old designer of the AK-47, strolled through the crowd,
posing for pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Executives from General Dynamics, the American defense
contractor, were also there, scrutinizing the Russian tanks.
Russian officials say that General Dynamics is discussing the
purchase of a revolutionary Russian system to protect tanks from
missile and grenade attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exports are the most important thing for us because they bring
in real money,'' said Viktor Yamov, the chief of advertising for
Uralvagonzavod, manufacturer of the T-90 tank. ``We don't see much
real money from the Russian army.''
</P>
<P>
   There are two ways to calculate arms sales: agreements made and
actual deliveries. In terms of deliveries last year, the real money
from the rest of the world totaled $2.8 billion, putting Russia
fourth, behind the United States, France and Britain, in weapons
sales. Russian weapons accounted for 6 percent of all arms
delivered _ compared with 49 percent for the United States _ but
Terence Taylor, assistant director of the Institute of Strategic
Studies in London, says that Russia is now expanding that share
toward 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   During Soviet times, the military sector had first claim on
resources here and defense plants churned out thousands of tanks,
artillery pieces and air defense missiles. Weapons production was
surrounded by intense secrecy, and, although the Soviets dispatched
tons of weaponry to friendly nations, a fair to sell arms to the
world was unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   With the Soviet collapse, Russia's defense complex plunged into
depression. Defense orders dried up. Debts to suppliers and
utilities mounted. Conversion to civilian production remained
largely a pipe dream. Exports became a vital, if tenuous, lifeline.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, the Russian armed forces are buying very
little,'' Taylor said in a telephone interview. ``Virtually all of
the production is going for export.''
</P>
<P>
   Yamov's factory, a sprawling complex near this test range that
used to employ 45,000 people, is a case in point. It produced all
of the Soviet tanks, from the legendary T-34 of World War II to its
T-72, operating under the cover story that it turned out mere
railroad cars. Now, it lives for exports.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is on the verge of announcing a major arms deal with
India under which it would buy about 300 T-90 tanks. One hundred of
them would be manufactured at the Uralvagonzavod plant, with some
200 assembled in India. Russian press reports estimate the deal is
worth some $700 million.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the Russian Army has just two T-90 tanks in the
European part of its territory, according to data Moscow supplied
in January under the treaty limiting conventional forces in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   And despite President Vladimir Putin's pledge to boost weapons
procurement, the Russian Army is scheduled to receive only 30 T-90
tanks this year. That is a small fraction of the 350 new tanks Col.
Gen. Anatoly Sitnov, the weapons chief for the Russian armed
forces, says are needed each year.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Russian air force is buying just 12 SU-30 fighter
and attack planes, although with exports in mind, about 50 are
being produced. In 1998, the air force did not acquire a single new
fighter.
</P>
<P>
   While exports are vital to Russia's military complex,
competition is stiff. Western nations can offer more generous
financing, have long-standing customers and better maintenance and
spare parts service after sale. And former Soviet states like
Ukraine, which also inherited Soviet defense plants, compete for
orders Russia covets.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the Russian military has fielded so few new
weapons does not help either; many customers like only to buy
systems that have been put to the test.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Russians have some advantages. Low labor costs make
their weapons cheaper than those of Western counterparts. They also
have a reputation for producing high-quality armored systems,
anti-tactical missile systems and artillery.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's weapons trade has consequences for its foreign policy,
according to some experts here. The defense establishment is still
dominated by men reared in Cold War enmity; the competition for
sales has reinforced the notion that America is an unfriendly rival
whose success comes at Russia's expense, particularly since NATO
has expanded its membership and hence its arms clientele into the
former Soviet bastion of Central Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes the defense establishment even more anti-American,''
said Dmitri Trenin, the deputy director of the Moscow Carnegie
Center. ``This is not just the abstract notion of competition. It
is a confrontation over money.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of Russia's arms exports go to two nations,
China and India. Their primary interest is in acquiring the means
to make weapons, not just to buy the weapons systems themselves, a
development that contributes to the spread of advanced military
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's major deals with China include a licensing agreement
permitting Beijing to help produce SU-27 aircraft and the sale of
two destroyers. In addition to the pending tank contract with
India, another deal under discussion would provide the Indians with
the Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Gorshkov and the MIG-29 planes
that would be on it.
</P>
<P>
   Measured in terms of agreements, Russia counted for 40 percent
of weapons sales to Asia between 1995 and 1998, according to
Richard F. Grimmett of the Congressional Research Service in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians are highly dependent on arms contracts with those
two countries,'' Grimmett said. ``China and India have tremendous
leverage in terms of getting the advanced equipment they are
seeking.''
</P>
<P>
   With a younger, more dynamic president now in the Kremlin and
sales at stake, the Russians appeared to go all out to make this
week's arms fair in the Urals _ the second annual event here _ a
prestigious occasion. Putin himself showed up.
</P>
<P>
   And there were several new pieces of weaponry. One notable new
item was a tank support vehicle, which has a crew of five. It has
the protection of a tank but is outfitted with a unique set of
weapons, including grenade launchers, a 30-millimeter cannon and
four anti-tank missiles. The Russians appear to have designed the
weapon with an insurgency like the one in Chechnya in mind, but it
was a big hit with the Chinese, who clustered around it.
</P>
<P>
   Another novel system that attracted attention was Nakidka,
basically a tarpaulin that is draped over equipment to foil weapons
guided by radar and heat-seeking devices that create images from
the heat of objects.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign military officials also seemed impressed by the Iskander
surface-to-surface missile, which was shown for the first time, and
the S-300 system, which is designed to shoot down Scud-type
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Among the hits of the arms fair were the T-80 and T-90 jumping
tanks, which zoomed up a ramp and leaped through the air.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of foreigners who identified themselves only as defense
attaches, intelligence experts or trade officials but often
declined to give their names, prowled among the exhibits. Many
carried sophisticated cameras and snapped detailed pictures of
firing mechanisms, artillery tubes and weapons chassis.
</P>
<P>
   While Kuwait may owe its freedom from Iraqi occupation to the
coalition of troops the United States assembled to fight the war in
the Persian Gulf, Kuwaiti military officials eagerly talked with
the Russians about their tanks.
</P>
<P>
   An Iranian delegation wanted to see executives at
Uralvagonzavod. Iran has a fleet of T-72 tanks and is interested in
upgrades, said Yamov, the advertising director.
</P>
<P>
   General Dynamics, for its part, has been exploring the idea of
acquiring Russia's Arena system, which uses a radar to detect
anti-tank missiles or grenades and destroys them by firing
munitions, according to Alexander Kobin, the general director of
Rosvooruzheniye, the Russian arms sales agency. He indicated that
Putin would have to decide whether the system could be provided to
the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the American corporation, based in Falls Church,
Va., declined to discuss their interest in Arena, but they were
certainly taking a close look at the Russian tanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one country has the corner on good ideas,'' said Philip W.
Lett, the former program manager for the U.S. Army's M-1 tank
program and a General Dynamics consultant.
</P>
<P>
   And despite their long alliance with Washington, the South
Koreans expressed interest in exploring production with the
Russians. As a South Korean defense attache put it, ``Business is
business.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Given the total seclusion of the Camp David peace
talks, photographs issued by the White House offer the only glimpse
inside the presidential retreat. They present frozen images of men
in shirtsleeves, pens poised over note pads, their faces absorbed
in thought.
</P>
<P>
   While it is impossible to know what is going on at those
negotiating tables, the delegations themselves offer a road map to
the process. Israelis, Palestinians and Americans, their political,
military and diplomatic careers have been interwoven and, in some
cases, steered exclusively toward this goal: the supposed endgame
of the Israeli-Palestinian peace effort and the resolution of 52
years of conflict.
</P>
<P>
   For the three members of the U.S. peace team, for instance, this
summit meeting marks the culmination of a professional life spent
shuttling between Israelis and Arabs, a career that became a
personal mission.
</P>
<P>
   In negotiations that will surely go right to the wire, and then
trip it, everything will eventually come down to the leaders
themselves. But the fabric of relations is knitted by the
negotiators, by, say, the interaction between Shlomo Ben Ami, the
popular Labor Party politician who is a potential future challenger
to Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel, and Abu Ala, the
Palestinian parliament speaker, who is a potential future heir to
Yasser Arafat, president of the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, leader of the Labor Party and a general turned
peacemaker, brought the smallest delegation, a relatively lean,
mean team of mostly military men and center-left politicians like
himself. This fighting trim was not intentional; it reflects the
defection of the rightist parties in his government on the eve of
his departure. But it could serve to streamline his approach, since
he will not have to answer to the deep-seated reluctance of those
ministers who would otherwise have come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barak is so intent he is like a horse with blinders, and this
will make it simpler here, although harder when he returns home,''
an adviser to the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Arafat traveled to the United States not only with
his senior negotiators, security professionals and economic
advisers but with some opposition party leaders and with a vocal
critic as the appointed spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Barak, a democratic leader, Arafat, who is often
considered to be an authoritarian, has surrounded himself with a
consensus-building organism. The opposition leaders are not inside
Camp David _ in fact, the Americans would not admit them when they
banged at the gate last week _ but even within the group inside,
there is a spectrum ranging from the more pragmatic to the more
cynical, from money men to ideologues.
</P>
<P>
   Some U.S. and Israeli officials think Arafat would not have made
the journey in such complete Palestinian company if he were not
intent on reaching some kind of deal.
</P>
<P>
   But an adviser to Arafat cautioned that the Palestinian leader
has always ``tried to bring people inside his tent'' _ and that has
been a strength and a weakness. Sometimes, hard-liners have kept
him ``too pure,'' an Israeli official said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the main opposition leaders, like Sheik Ahmed Yassin of
the radical Islamic group Hamas, did not accept his call for unity
behind the peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time,'' a former diplomat said, ``Arafat will only make a
deal when it is to his advantage, and he won't let artificial
deadlines force him into something he doesn't want to do.'' The
artificial deadline that the former diplomat is citing is President
Clinton's scheduled departure for Okinawa on Wednesday for the
meeting of major industrial nations.
</P>
<P>
   Behind Clinton at Camp David, there is a triptych of diplomats
who _ sometimes symbiotically, sometimes competitively _ have
devoted themselves to the Middle East since the 1980s: Dennis Ross,
52, chief Middle East peace envoy; his deputy, Aaron D. Miller, 51;
and Martin Indyk, 49, who is now on his second tour as ambassador
to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For all three men, their formative experience was the 1973
Arab-Israeli war. Miller and Indyk were graduate students in
Israel; Ross had just left. And as young Jewish intellectuals,
colleagues say, they came away believing that Israel needed peace
with its neighbors as badly as it needed to be protected from
another devastating war.
</P>
<P>
   From that conviction, their concept of Israel grew, fortified by
a strong security relationship with the United States, making peace
with its neighbors through incremental steps. These ideas were
developed by Indyk, who became the first director of the Washington
Institute for Near East Policy, an offshoot of the American Israel
Public Affairs Committee, and by Ross, who perched there briefly in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton became president, he gave the three men a chance
to turn position papers into policy. Indyk, an Australian, became a
U.S. citizen to seize the moment.
</P>
<P>
   The three began with the 1993 Oslo interim peace accord. Miller
cultivated relations with Arafat, whom he had first met in Tunis,
and his key aides. Ross and Indyk concentrated on the Israelis. And
when Barak was elected prime minister last year, the three made
little secret of their pleasure at having an Israeli leader whose
peacemaking platform matched theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians, who think U.S. policy has long been skewed toward
Israel, frequently note quietly that all three U.S. negotiators are
Jewish. But over the course of their repeated trekking to Gaza and
Ramallah to visit Arafat, the three have come to be seen as fair _
although this judgment could fray in the heat of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving for the summit meeting, one of the three said
that it was the most ``extraordinary development'' he had
experienced in 20 years. ``The stakes are incredibly high,'' he
said _ and it was clear he was talking both personally and
diplomatically.
</P>
<P>
   Stakes are high, of course, for all present.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There is not a single Palestinian official with the stature of
Arafat. But in the speculation about who will succeed the
70-year-old leader, his long-time deputies, Abu Ala and Abu Mazen,
are the top contenders. They are formally positioned to split his
two roles: Abu Ala to succeed him as president of the Palestinian
National Authority and Abu Mazen as chairman of the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
</P>
<P>
   As such, they have an investment in negotiating a final peace
accord that could stand the test of time. And yet, while they are
both relative moderates within the Palestinian world, the
delegation's official position is that the summit meeting is being
held too soon, without the proper groundwork laid for a full or
even partial resolution of outstanding problems.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Camp David, Abu Ala, 63, a gritty pragmatist and strong
strategist, is certain to be playing the visible lead role.
Although Arafat occasionally considers him a bit too independent,
he has relied on Abu Ala for the hands-on part of all key
negotiations. Abu Mazen, 65, who was the godfather of the
breakthrough Oslo talks in 1993, is more the overseer.

<P>
   Palestinians think of Abu Ala, a forceful white-haired
politician who comes from the town of Abu Dis, adjacent to
Jerusalem, as a businessman for his role overseeing PLO
investments, and consider that the key to his negotiating skill. He
negotiated the 1995 interim peace agreement, Oslo II. But, on the
plane ride to Washington for the signing ceremony, Arafat informed
him that Abu Mazen would sign the agreement and deliver the speech.
Abu Ala was crestfallen, and withdrew to the sidelines of the
negotiation process for some time.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Abu Ala was accorded no official role in the present
final-status peace negotiations. But he played the more important
unofficial part in back-channel talks that eventually moved to
Stockholm this spring and then materialized into the main channel.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Abu Mazen, whose West Bank villa in Ramallah has
been the site for late-night meetings of Israeli and Palestinian
leaders, was in charge of the Israeli file of secret contacts
between the PLO and progressive Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the relationships he nurtured, Israeli doves and
U.S. peace negotiators regarded him as the most flexible
Palestinian official. This made it difficult for him to play a
central role, because it discredited him on the Palestinian street.
But Abu Mazen, anyway, prefers to be behind the scenes, thinking
the big thoughts.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Saeb Erekat, a political scientist who is almost 20 years
younger, has been most visible to the Americans, since he makes
media appearances and whispers English translations into Arafat's
ears. He was not an original member of the PLO, never lived in
exile and is thus considered to be in better touch with popular
sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   Erekat made his diplomatic entrance by defying his superiors'
orders in the Madrid peace talks in 1991, when the Palestinians
were trying to keep a low profile. He walked into the talks with a
kaffiyeh draped over his shoulder. Arafat scolded him later, but
Erekat disarmed him by saying, ``Mr. Chairman, I felt I was
carrying a piece of you inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat is also accompanied by his senior security chief,
Mohammed Dahlan;his information minister, Yasser Abed Rabbo, who
plays the role of house skeptic; and his senior economic adviser,
Mohammed Rachid, who is an Iraqi-born Kurd.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Rachid is the most pragmatic and the least ideological of the
delegation, and Arafat is said to feel indebted to him for creating
the monopoly businesses that generated the first income for the
Palestinian Authority _ along with allegations of cronyism and
corruption. Before the summit meeting, Rachid was preparing the
Palestinians' compensation demands _ $40 billion, mostly for
refugees _ and making clear that if he had sufficient influence, he
would steer Arafat toward the practical.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli delegation is not a well-oiled peace team, like the
Americans and the Palestinians, but a disparate, experienced group
of politicians, lawyers and generals. At the last minute, after the
summit meeting had already begun, Barak summoned Dan Meridor, a
right-leaning legislator, to round out the center-left delegation.
</P>
<P>
   Elyakim Rubinstein, a religious Jew and the attorney general,
was reportedly reluctant to come. But he is there as the
government's lawyer, and as the only delegate who participated in
the original Camp David in 1978, bringing with him the accumulated
experience of all the peace agreements from then on. Insiders say
that he also tells the jokes.
</P>
<P>
   The two central negotiators are Ben Ami and Gilad Sher, a
private lawyer who used to be a lawyer for the military. Barak
trusts Sher, who negotiated the most recent interim agreement last
September, precisely because he is apolitical.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Ami, on the other hand, is a Moroccan-born Israeli. He rose
from humble beginnings to become an Oxford-educated historian and
Israeli diplomat who, in the most recent Labor Party primary, shot
up from political obscurity to the top spot behind Barak. Insiders
say that it signals Barak's keen desire for an agreement that he is
willing to use him as a resource, to tolerate his meetings with
Clinton on the back porch of the Aspen Cabin, which surely raise
Ben Ami's political capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, as Barak sees it, the team is not essential,'' said an
Israeli Cabinet minister. ``They fill the chairs, make the
atmosphere. He's so sure of himself. At Camp David, Barak is
everything.''

MASRY RETURNS TO PRACTICE - ON TV
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECILIA CHAN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. _ Westlake Village attorney Edward Masry sat
patiently as the makeup artist at Empire Studios dabbed on
foundation and powder and trimmed his gray eyebrows and sideburns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want you to be confused,'' said Masry, known to
moviegoers as the real-life boss in the recent film ``Erin
Brockovich.''
</P>
<P>
   ``About?'' the woman asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``That I'm Tom Cruise,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   Portrayed by actor Albert Finney in this year's Julia Roberts
blockbuster, Masry is now starring in his own courtroom drama.
``Power of Attorney'' - sort of a cross between ``Judge Judy'' and
``L.A. Law'' - debuts Aug. 28, featuring Gloria Allred, Christopher
Darden and other high-profile attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   For Masry, 67, it was the first time in a decade that he was
back in the courtroom. After suffering a heart attack while arguing
a 1990 case in federal court, his wife made him promise to leave
the trial work to others.
</P>
<P>
   But in his new half-hour show, Masry and a corps of 22 other
attorneys will represent clients in misdemeanor and civil cases
heard by former New Jersey Judge Andrew P. Napolitano, who will
issue binding decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am doing this because people don't understand the role we
attorneys play in life,'' said Masry, of Thousand Oaks. ``I think
it's good for them to have a program like this. This is as close to
realism as they can get here.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way I miss the courtroom. I am looking forward to it.
It's a challenge,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Masry was selected for the show from a pool of 40 attorneys,
most of whom were chosen after a test shot. The partner in Masry &AMP;
Vittitoe, however, didn't have to go through a tryout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed was one of the few people we did not test,'' said John
Rizzotti, a spokesman for Twentieth Century Television, a division
of Fox, which is producing the show. ``We felt confident enough he
could handle himself in front of the camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``After `Erin Brockovich,' he was bombarded by the press and he
handled himself well in interviews, travel and speaking
abilities,'' Rizzotti said.
</P>
<P>
   During a taping early Friday, Masry went head-to-head against
Boston attorney Wendy Murphy in a civil dispute between two
sisters. A session scheduled for today pits him against Darden, one
of the prosecutors in the O.J. Simpson criminal case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris has been up against the best, so Chris is a very good
lawyer,'' Masry said. ``But I'm more concerned with Wendy because I
am dealing with an unknown. I've seen Darden in court and can
pretty much predict what he will do. I don't know if Wendy is
laid-back or aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Masry said in his typical pit bull style, ``I'm
looking forward to totally destroying that woman.''
</P>
<P>
   During his first taping, Masry represented Jessica, who was
suing her sister for $5,000 for damage to her truck. Murphy
represented Rachel, the defendant, who admitted she accidentally
crashed the truck, but didn't think she should have to pay because
the vehicle was uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   After some feisty exchanges, tears and objections raised by both
sides, Napolitano awarded $5,000 to Masry's client.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the studio's Green Room, Masry critically assessed his
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really rusty,'' he said. ``It's been 10 years since I've
been in a courtroom. I felt it. It took me awhile to start to get
back into it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Murphy gave high praise to Masry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt he did a great job,'' she said. ``Obviously, he is
experienced and he is someone I admire.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is an icon in the legal community and a hero. I've always
admired him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, of course, I loved `Erin Brockovich.'''
</P>
<P>
   The movie, which has grossed more than $120 million, starred
Roberts as Brockovich, a fledging file clerk who with Masry, waged
a legal battle against Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric Co. The duo won a
record $333 million settlement for residents in the High Desert
town of Hinkley, Calif., after determining the utility had
contaminated the water supply.
</P>
<P>
   ```Erin Brockovich' made him,'' Rizzotti said. ``I mean, taking
into consideration that Ed is an exceptional lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In law circles he was fairly well known, but the nation did
not know him until `Erin Brockovich' came out,'' Rizzotti said.
``We are putting him back in front of the camera so his 15 minutes
of fame is not over yet.''
</P>
<P>
   And although his face has been plastered all over television,
newspapers and magazines such as ``People,'' the notoriety hasn't
gone to his head, said Joey Masry, who accompanied her husband of
10 years to the first taping.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the same,'' she said. ``He's a workaholic. In the car
he's on the phone, in the house he's on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1975, I've gone with him and have seen him in papers and
on TV,'' she said. ``This is a little more publicity, but I am used
to him being a public figure.''
</P>
<P>
   Masry also said fame hasn't changed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still that good-looking, attractive, handsome young man,''
he said with a grin.

IMPLANTS COULD RESTORE SIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT MONROE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Encroaching on the domain of miracles, a
biotechnology firm hopes to restore long-term vision to blind
people as early as next year.
</P>
<P>
   The name of the company, Second Sight, extends a promise made
when the first blind patients reported _ with a mix of elation and
confusion _ seeing basic shapes during university experiments nine
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now the company joins a small field of competitors racing to be
the first to create replacements for damaged retinas that are
suitable for widespread use. Second Sight President Dr. Robert
Greenberg said such use of his implant is a ``when'' rather than an
``if'' proposition now that a key threshold _ wireless transmission
of images to the retina _ appears to have been crossed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we'd like to be able to do is send patients home with
these devices,'' Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   If key problems are solved, researchers estimate that implants
could be available to the general public within a decade. The
potential market for Second Sight's retinal implant, which works on
the same basic principle as a television, could number as high as
20 million, the estimate of how many people worldwide have
degenerative retinal diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gerald Loeb, director of the Medical Devices Development
Facility at the University of Southern California, thinks Second
Sight and its collaborators stand the best chance of success among
research groups attempting retinal implants. The size of the eye
and its delicacy, however, makes Loeb think that implants directly
onto the brain's visual cortex _ also under research _ stand a
better chance.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Loeb said, people said cochlear implants would never
help deaf people hear, an successful invention he helped create 20
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going into the eye, the way they're doing it is the
right way in my opinion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the artificial sight might never become as good as
the real thing, some of the 20-odd people who have had basic sight
restored for mere hours have signed up to be experiment subjects
again and again.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Churchey, a 72-year-old Sharpsburg, Md., resident has
undergone three implant surgeries since 1992. Retinitis pigmentosa
has stolen all of what little sight he had to begin with as a
child.
</P>
<P>
   ``About the only way I know the sun is shining is I feel the
heat,'' said Churchey, who ran a snack bar in a state physical
rehabilitation center for 33 years before retiring in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In the first experiment, he saw a burst of light. In the third
surgery, four years later at Johns Hopkins University, he was able
to make out the letter H after electrodes in that shape were
stimulated. He called the experience a blessing and said if
researchers want him for a fourth try, he's ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a routine but I'd be happy to change that routine if I
could see,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Retinal disease foundations are as excited as Churchey. Tom
Hoglund, spokesman for the Foundation Fighting Blindness in
suburban Baltimore, said implants' potential to at least allow
people to function without seeing-eye dogs is ``in itself just
fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been watching this field grow immeasurably,'' Hoglund
said. ``There's clearly commercial interest in developing this and
when there is, that shows that somebody believes there is a viable
product out there.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of 18-month-old Second Sight, the commercial
interest has come from local high-tech inventor and financier Al
Mann, whose other ventures include insulin pump maker MiniMed and
cochlear implant maker Advanced Bionics. Mann leads a trio of
investors interested in commercial results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Universities don't always have the same objectives, the same
methods,'' he said. ``They don't really know how to make
products.''
</P>
<P>
   Eye researchers have pursued artificial vision through devices
like Second Sight's for 20 years, borrowing ideas from the first
cochlear implants that restored hearing in deaf patients. The eye
implant Greenberg envisions would include a camera mounted on a
pair of glasses. It would break down images like pixels on a
television screen and transmit them to a panel of electrodes
positioned over the retina.
</P>
<P>
   To date, human recipients have had a power source attached to an
electrode array by a wire that protrudes from the sclera, or white
of the eye. The exposed wire would make the device too hazardous
for everyday use. And the best resolution researchers have been
able to produce allowed patients to distinguish letters on stark
backgrounds like Churchey's H, but no more.
</P>
<P>
   So far, researchers have made an electrode panel that produces a
mere 25 pixels of sight, compared with about 300,000 that make up
images on a basic computer screen. Imagine everything in your field
of view limited to 25 blocks, each filled with a blob of a single
color.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the slow process, problems that might have taken
several decades to solve have already been overcome. Greenberg
credits an infusion of cash by Mann and other investors for the
creation of a new prototype _ one without dangerous wires
protruding through the eye.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL 2ND TAKE FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The company, situated in a suburban Santa Clarita business
complex that lies in the shadow of the Magic Mountain amusement
park, joins at least three other research groups in the United
States and Germany attempting to make various implants work. There
is a faint atmosphere of espionage as players try to guess if there
are still more competitors and closely guard data about their own
products.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg covered up chalkboards full of calculations as he
talked to a reporter in his office last week. He would not say when
exactly the wireless implant was developed, but it was sometime
this year and has been fitted in an animal. The device transmits
the signal via radio waves, the glasses-mounted camera being the
television station beaming images to the TV set that is the
implant.
</P>
<P>
   The device's safety is tested first, then its effectiveness. A
clinical trial for humans would be next.
</P>
<P>
   It's in the nature of experiments to have downsides and the
implants are no exception.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, researchers decided that people who have never had
sight before do not make the best candidates. Greenberg recounts
the story of an early experiment, in which an implant recipient was
disturbed by the strange bursts which his brain had never had
reason to comprehend before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was as if he had ESP,'' Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   And there are several problems to be resolved before the
previously sighted can have some vision restored. Greenberg hopes
to be able to make a 33-by-33-electrode array so recipients can
improve resolution but the means must be found to fit more
electrodes on the same 2-by-3 millimeter panel.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, implant chips, being electronic, could pose a
hazard to surrounding eye tissue by the heat they produce. They
also need a place in the inner eye on which to anchor. Greenberg,
whose company announced a formal research collaboration with five
universities at the end of June, has yet to figure out how to keep
it from floating around in the fluid-filled center of the eye.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenberg said a study not yet published will show that the
heat generated is not sufficient to cause damage and that the
collaboration is exploring methods such as tacking the implant onto
the surface of the retina.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've assembled the best and brightest minds to work on these
problems,'' Greenberg said. ``There are thousands of patients who
have no hope of vision by any other means.''

LEUKEMIA VICTIM HELPS SICK KIDS

<P>
   PALMDALE, Calif. _ Eleven-year-old Brittany McDaniels is a
fighter.
</P>
<P>
   When she was diagnosed with leukemia two years ago, Brittany
vowed to battle the disease and has since expended her formidable
energies on raising thousands of dollars to find a cure and helping
others like her who are afflicted with illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her outlook is, `I want to live, I don't want to die.' That's
what it was from day one: `cancer is not going to beat me,''' said
Brittany's mother, Barbara McDaniels.
</P>
<P>
   Brittany's latest crusade is to raise money to buy Nintendo 64
video games to replace the ones stolen from the pediatric oncology
clinic at the Kaiser Permanente Hospital in Woodland Hills, where
she receives chemotherapy treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The games provide a vital diversion for young cancer patients,
who at times spend up to eight hours a day at the clinic getting
blood drawn, waiting for lab results, and undergoing treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are there for a long time, and you are very bored. It
helps to have something to do,'' said Brittany, whose hair started
growing back four months ago. ``I was really mad (about the theft)
because I couldn't think why somebody would take our things.''
</P>
<P>
   The theft of the five games a couple weeks ago was not the first
time the pediatric oncology clinic has been hit. A donated Nintendo
game system was stolen a while back and was replaced by the
volunteer department, according to staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``That people would steal from children is unthinkable,
especially children who are fighting for their lives,'' said Alicia
DeGroff, a registered nurse at the clinic.
</P>
<P>
   To raise money, Brittany and her friends in her west Palmdale
neighborhood are having a bake sale. They've made cookies,
cupcakes, brownies, breads, cakes and candy. So far they've raised
$100.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me and my friends were selling lemonade. I was thinking we
could use money for the video games. Then we were like, `Let's have
a bake sale,''' Brittany said.
</P>
<P>
   Brittany's efforts are typical of her generosity and warm
spirit, said her mother and staff members at the clinic.
</P>
<P>
   She raises money for the Leukemia Society, including $3,000 last
year on a fund-raising walk. She gives talks to local schools as
part of the society's ``Pasta for Pennies'' campaign: the class
that collects the most change wins a free outing to the local Olive
Garden restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   She's raised money for the Ronald McDonald's camp, appeared on
the Donny and Marie Show to publicize her cause, and made a
commercial for the Make-a-Wish Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   On a more personal level, she wrote to and got tickets from
Legoland theme park for a 3-year-old boy who is a fellow patient at
the clinic, and recently donated a chest of her own toys to be
given to children who undergo particularly difficult procedures,
such as having bone marrow samples taken or spinal taps.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a very special and warm-hearted child. She's made little
things for the staff,'' DeGroff said.
</P>
<P>
   DeGroff recalled Brittany having a painful experience when she
had to have an IV needle stuck in her hand. ``It was very
traumatic, and yet the next day, she left a bookmark for me that
said, `Love comes from the heart.' The child had a traumatic event
and she brings you something,'' DeGroff said.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Mendoza, a campaign manager for the greater Los Angeles
chapter of the Leukemia Society, describes Brittany as a ``little
angel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a little fighter,'' Mendoza said. ``It's amazing that
even after chemotherapy and debilitating drugs she has to take that
she finds the time and energy to do stuff for other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara McDaniels said Brittany, the third of her four children,
is her hero. Brittany is not bitter despite having to endure
numerous hospitalizations and exhibits incredible spirit and
strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so proud of her. It really comes from her heart. She never
asks for anything for herself. She's the biggest trooper and
doesn't really complain,'' the mother said. ``That's what inspires
me.''

SOAKING THE RICH ISN'T WHAT IT USED TO BE 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Week in Review) 
(NOTE TO INTERNATIONAL CLIENTS: For use by special arrangement
only. Asian and European points: Call Karl Horwitz in Paris for
details and prices. Phone: 47 42 17 11; fax: 47-42-80-44. 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The belief that anyone can grow rich in America took root even
before the colonies decided to become a nation. This faith has
outlasted innumerable depressions, recessions, inflations and
deflations, and today, with somewhere between 4 million and 5
million millionaires in the country, over 4 percent of all
households, it seems stronger than ever.
</P>
<P>
   It's wise to keep this fiscal theology in mind when you are
trying to understand the push that congressional Republicans are
making to repeal the estate tax _ and the unexpectedly wide support
they've garnered, both in Congress and among many Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted 59-39 on Friday to repeal the tax over 10
years, at an estimated cost of $104 billion in lost revenue over
the next decade, and $750 billion the decade after. In June the
House, including 63 Democrats, voted 279-136 for repeal.
</P>
<P>
   President Woodrow Wilson signed the estate tax into law in 1916
to help finance World War I and, to some degree, soak the rich. Its
supporters extended from Theodore Roosevelt to Franklin D.
Roosevelt to Lyndon B. Johnson, who believed the tax would narrow
the chasm between rich and poor.
</P>
<P>
   In this tradition, President Clinton has vowed to veto a repeal
as a handout to the rich, money that he says could be better used
to pay for prescriptions for the elderly. But the Republicans are
betting that the days are over for class warfare over taxes, and
they may be right. Attitudes have changed as the investor class has
swelled and ordinary Americans play the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Even though only the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans who die
each year would benefit if the tax were repealed, a remarkable 60
percent of Americans support repeal, according to a Gallup poll in
June. In another example of optimism outrunning reality, 17 percent
of those polled thought the tax would apply to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people who do not have estates large enough to be
taxed are worrying that someday down the road they will,'' said
Bruce Bartlett, a senior fellow at the National Center for Policy
Analysis, a conservative research group. The ranks of the worried
are swelling along with real estate prices in prosperous suburbs
and urban neighborhoods from Florida to Boston to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nydia Velazquez, a liberal New York Democrat who might have
been expected to oppose repeal, instead embraces it. ``Maybe five
and 10 years ago it didn't make sense, but it does make sense
today, given the reality of the real estate market and the
fast-growing values of small business,'' she said. ``This
represents a real financial burden on a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   It is another measure of how popular the issue has become that
the Democrats felt compelled to offer a compromise, which would
have reduced the tax, not abolished it. That was voted down on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, estates are generally exempt from federal
taxation up to $675,000, an amount scheduled to climb to $1 million
by 2006. Family-owned businesses and farms are exempt up to $1.3
million. The tax, which hit 47,596 estates in 1997 (out of the 2.3
million Americans who died), starts at 37 percent and climbs to a
maximum of 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of the tax see it as a tool for raising revenues and,
more fundamentally, for narrowing the nation's economic inequities.
To hear them talk, the only people who pay it are billionaires like
Warren Buffett and Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists for repeal, however, condemn what they see as a death
tax that socks mostly farmers and small businesses, hard-working
people who have pulled themselves up, creating wealth and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought government was supposed to protect our property, not
confiscate it, not penalize someone because they've been
successful,'' said Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the tax point out that estate tax payments by
farmers represent only 1 percent of the taxes paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other side has done a pretty good job of selling it, in
pretending that it's the little guys who pay it,'' said Robert
McIntyre, executive director of Citizens for Tax Justice, a
Washington-based advocacy group that wants to retain the tax.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Davenport, a tax expert at Rutgers University in Newark,
N.J., said that repealing the tax would mean a $7 million tax cut
for the top 0.1 percent of families. ``Why is it that the people
who have enjoyed the greatest run-up in wealth in the last decade
deserve a tax break now of this amount?'' he said. ``There's no
compelling argument.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of repeal make their own arguments about fairness.

SOAKING THE RICH ISN'T WHAT IT USED TO BE

 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The belief that anyone can grow rich in America took root even
before the colonies decided to become a nation. This faith has
outlasted innumerable depressions, recessions, inflations and
deflations, and today, with somewhere between 4 million and 5
million millionaires in the country, over 4 percent of all
households, it seems stronger than ever.
</P>
<P>
   It's wise to keep this fiscal theology in mind when you are
trying to understand the push that congressional Republicans are
making to repeal the estate tax _ and the unexpectedly wide support
they've garnered, both in Congress and among many Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted 59-39 on Friday to repeal the tax over 10
years, at an estimated cost of $104 billion in lost revenue over
the next decade, and $750 billion the decade after. In June the
House, including 63 Democrats, voted 279-136 for repeal.
</P>
<P>
   President Woodrow Wilson signed the estate tax into law in 1916
to help finance World War I and, to some degree, soak the rich. Its
supporters extended from Theodore Roosevelt to Franklin D.
Roosevelt to Lyndon B. Johnson, who believed the tax would narrow
the chasm between rich and poor.
</P>
<P>
   In this tradition, President Clinton has vowed to veto a repeal
as a handout to the rich, money that he says could be better used
to pay for prescriptions for the elderly. But the Republicans are
betting that the days are over for class warfare over taxes, and
they may be right. Attitudes have changed as the investor class has
swelled and ordinary Americans play the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Even though only the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans who die
each year would benefit if the tax were repealed, a remarkable 60
percent of Americans support repeal, according to a Gallup poll in
June. In another example of optimism outrunning reality, 17 percent
of those polled thought the tax would apply to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people who do not have estates large enough to be
taxed are worrying that someday down the road they will,'' said
Bruce Bartlett, a senior fellow at the National Center for Policy
Analysis, a conservative research group. The ranks of the worried
are swelling along with real estate prices in prosperous suburbs
and urban neighborhoods from Florida to Boston to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nydia Velazquez, a liberal New York Democrat who might have
been expected to oppose repeal, instead embraces it. ``Maybe five
and 10 years ago it didn't make sense, but it does make sense
today, given the reality of the real estate market and the
fast-growing values of small business,'' she said. ``This
represents a real financial burden on a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   It is another measure of how popular the issue has become that
the Democrats felt compelled to offer a compromise, which would
have reduced the tax, not abolished it. That was voted down on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, estates are generally exempt from federal
taxation up to $675,000, an amount scheduled to climb to $1 million
by 2006. Family-owned businesses and farms are exempt up to $1.3
million. The tax, which hit 47,596 estates in 1997 (out of the 2.3
million Americans who died), starts at 37 percent and climbs to a
maximum of 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of the tax see it as a tool for raising revenues and,
more fundamentally, for narrowing the nation's economic inequities.
To hear them talk, the only people who pay it are billionaires like
Warren Buffett and Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists for repeal, however, condemn what they see as a death
tax that socks mostly farmers and small businesses, hard-working
people who have pulled themselves up, creating wealth and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought government was supposed to protect our property, not
confiscate it, not penalize someone because they've been
successful,'' said Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the tax point out that estate tax payments by
farmers represent only 1 percent of the taxes paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other side has done a pretty good job of selling it, in
pretending that it's the little guys who pay it,'' said Robert
McIntyre, executive director of Citizens for Tax Justice, a
Washington-based advocacy group that wants to retain the tax.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Davenport, a tax expert at Rutgers University in Newark,
N.J., said that repealing the tax would mean a $7 million tax cut
for the top 0.1 percent of families. ``Why is it that the people
who have enjoyed the greatest run-up in wealth in the last decade
deserve a tax break now of this amount?'' he said. ``There's no
compelling argument.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of repeal make their own arguments about fairness.
They charge unfair double taxation, noting that much of the wealth
hit by the inheritance tax has already been subject to income tax
and capital gains tax.
</P>
<P>
   More ingeniously, repealers make what might be called a
stupidity argument. They claim the tax is unfair because, as the
economists Henry Aaron and Alicia Munnell once wrote, it is
``imposed on those who neglect to plan ahead or retain unskilled
estate planners.'' Bartlett, the tax expert, said, ``It's a tax on

WORD FOR WORD: AL GORE'S SENIOR THESIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Week in Review) 
(Eds: Words in bold should be set in italics. Double parentheses
should be set as brackets.) 
(NOTE TO INTERNATIONAL CLIENTS: For use by special arrangement

<P>
   Ah, the lessons learned in youth. About love, faith, family and
yes, the power of television to define the modern presidency. This
last issue weighed especially heavily on at least one young person,
Albert Gore Jr., as revealed in the topic he chose for his senior
thesis for the history department at Harvard in 1969. Its title:
``The Impact of Television on the Conduct of the Presidency,
1947-1969.''
</P>
<P>
   The 84-page paper sheds light on an aspect of political life
that would preoccupy Gore in his career in public office and into
the current presidential campaign. Often perceived by voters as
stiff and overrehearsed, the vice president has sought advice from
image-makers conventional (the media consultant Carter Eskew) and
not so (the feminist author Naomi Wolf) for ways to improve his
image before the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that he was a senator's son probably didn't hurt the
research process: Those who granted him interviews included Arthur
Schlesinger Jr., who served as special assistant to President John
F. Kennedy; Bill Moyers, a former press secretary to President
Lyndon B. Johnson; and James Reston, a columnist and senior
executive at The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   _ PETER MARKS
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Shades of earth-tone suits: Every president since Harry Truman,
Gore writes, has had to adjust his image to the demands of the
television screen, even those with a special distaste for the
process, like Dwight D. Eisenhower: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   He was even persuaded against his will to change to a different
style of glasses so that he would come across better, and before
long he was using the TelePrompTer to be what he hated most _
artificially sincere.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; For Gore, John F. Kennedy was the closest thing to a political
TV star: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A large part of the credit for Kennedy's success on television
was due to his personality. Not everything can be explained in
terms of formats and camera work; there is no objective proof but
it is generally agreed that President Kennedy was simply better on
television than most. He was equipped with an understanding of the
medium and its exigencies, and he knew how to use the visual
rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; If Kennedy had the small-screen wattage of George Clooney, his
successor, Lyndon B. Johnson, was more akin to Drew Carey. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   President Johnson, according to Bill Moyers, often rehearsed TV
appearances and watched them on videotape, and after one such tape
had run for two minutes, ``the president jumped out of his seat,
turned off the monitor and exclaimed, `God damn, even I can't stand
that.''' He often said, ``I was born with these ears, these eyes,
this nose, this drawl; what can I do about it?''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Even if he couldn't fix the ears, Gore observes, President
Johnson was determined to influence the filming of them. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Johnson tried to control as many of the mechanics of the
broadcasts as he could. He began by advising television cameramen
that his best side is his left and he prefers to be photographed on
that side at angles of no less than 45 degrees. Stewart Alsop ((a
journalist)) commented that ``anybody but Johnson would have known
in advance that the photographers would vie with each other to get
pictures on his right side, preferably in the act of stroking his
long nose or pulling his ear.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Johnson's efforts to bend television news to his will clearly
fascinated Gore. The president's failure to grasp the subtleties of
the task is a recurring theme of the paper, as Gore illustrates in
an anecdote about Johnson's building of a television studio in the
basement of the White House. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Once this studio was set up, it presented irresistible
possibilities to Johnson. He began to use it ``at any moment,'' not
only for major speeches but for all manner of minor announcements.
Many of his appearances didn't even carry a bulletin slug on the
wire service reports. This practice had unfortunate consequences:
it overexposed the president, it produced friction with the
networks and it conflicted with the established expectations of the
viewing audience.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Gore also analyzes the decision by Richard M. Nixon, who had
taken office just two months before Gore submitted his thesis, to
forgo giving a State of the Union address just after his
inauguration. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Nixon may be quite correct and quite sophisticated. The State of
the Union address is not good television; it draws a large audience
because it pre-empts all three networks, but it is a dull show.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Of the changes wrought by the televised news conference, he
writes: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Before the advent of television, the president was much less
guarded in his statements. He had the prerogative of giving
background and going off the record completely. If he made a
mistake, he could correct it before it got into print; and if a
mistake was printed, it was still attributed to a ``White House
spokesman,'' or some such euphemism. ...
</P>
<P>
   Because there is no longer a margin for error, the president is
forced to view the conference much more seriously, and to prepare
himself more adequately. Luckily, it is easy to anticipate
questions .... But in order to do so, the president must prepare
for 10 times as many questions as are asked.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Which leads Gore to this observation: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The result of this for the president is that he is able to get
away with pre-polished answers lacking any depth. It has stripped
the press conference of any value it might have once had for
putting the president on the spot and probing his thoughts. He now
tells the press only what he wants to.

   ``Where Have All the Footnotes Gone?'' the historian Gertrude
Himmelfarb asked in a 1991 essay.(1) At that point, footnotes lucky
enough to survive at all had moved to the backs of books and turned
into less scrutinized endnotes. Annotation was out; breezy,
uninterrupted prose was in.
</P>
<P>
   At around the same time that historians were getting upset at
the decline of footnotes in journals and books, a physicist felt
there had to be a way to improve the referencing system on the
Internet. Instead of just getting upset, Tim Berners-Lee did
something about it: He created the World Wide Web, writing the
world's first browser and releasing his software as open-source
code in 1991.(2)
</P>
<P>
   Soon the missing footnotes would have a home.
</P>
<P>
   The reading process mourned by scholars who thought footnotes
superior to endnotes _ who preferred the process of interruption,
midstream re-evaluation and jumping around _ is the natural process

<P>
   Small children who would normally not read books with footnotes
until secondary school know their way around bright blue
hyperlinks.(3) They learn early that a Web site isn't complete
without references to other sites, and that the cooler the site,
the cooler its links.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed the Web has not only revived the footnote but also
spawned a cross-referencing craze that renders the formerly
complete media event into a reference-laden, link-dependent,
list-spewing wallflower waiting to be courted by the next available
annotator.
</P>
<P>
   Television shows, newspaper articles and radio programs refer to
Web sites, and those sites in turn refer to books, magazines and
software. Networks like MSNBC have even asked viewers to watch
television and the Internet simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   The original glorious goal of such cross-referencing was hip
media convergence: The actual result is fans running from the
living room to the den in a frustrated effort to view the computer
and television at the same time. One newspaper, The South Carolina
Post-Courier, now publishes hyperlinks _ not just Web addresses but
actual bar codes that readers can scan using laser pens provided by
the newspaper and, yes, attached to their PCs.
</P>
<P>
   In the old-media world, the question was how to get the audience
to stay with you. In the new-media world, it is how to get the
audience to leave and come back again. After all, it is not
readability that makes for greatness on the Web: It is
clickability.
</P>
<P>
   Obeying the Cartesian principle of new media _ ``I link,
therefore I am'' _ the popular search engine Google ranks its
results by popularity, measured in quantities of links. The best
sites, then, are the ones most often cited.

materials.
</P>
<P>
   In a realm where an index is hailed as a publication, the
pressure to be original is outweighed by the heavier pressure to be
well connected. Some of the connections grew out of strategic
alliances between visionary new-media companies and terrified
old-media companies. But since many 12-year-olds know enough html
to create hyperlinks between sites, much cross-referencing has
arrived unannounced, raising questions about the right to link.
</P>
<P>
   A daily Internet newspaper, The Shetland News, published
headlines that linked directly to stories in the electronic version
of the weekly newspaper The Shetland Times, without mentioning the
source. The News used ``deep links,'' connecting to the articles
themselves and bypassing the competition's home page. The Shetland
Times sued for copyright infringement. The parties reached a
settlement that called for a redesign of the links.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, cyberlaw was in its infancy, and anything seemed
possible. A site operated by Total News Inc. had no original
content, just links to 1,350 news outlets.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, The Washington Post, Time Inc., CNN, Reuters New Media,
the owners of the Los Angeles Times, and the owners of The Wall
Street Journal sued Total News, a five-person operation in Phoenix,
over multiple copyright and trademark violations. The attorneys for
the plaintiffs called Total News a ``parasitic Web site.''
</P>
<P>
   In the settlement, Total News was prohibited from using
``frames,'' a technology that did make its site look particularly
parasitic: CNN or Reuters items would pop up, conveniently bordered
by the Total News logo and ads. Like deep links, frames can make
another site seem like your own. Such connecting devices don't
merely link; they also claim credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inline'' linking runs even deeper, bringing information inside
a site. In 1996, a graduate student at Princeton, Dan Wallach, used
this technique to import the daily Dilbert comic strip to his home
page. United Media, which syndicates the strip, threatened to sue,
and he removed it.
</P>
<P>
   Wallach argued that he had designed the page so that the
company's content did not reside permanently on his server, and
that if he was guilty of copyright infringement, so was any search
engine. He wrote to the syndicate's attorney, ``Technically, I
present a directory of pointers in much the same way as Yahoo,
Lycos or Alta Vista.''(5)
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's hard to imagine an intellectual-property lawsuit
against one of those engines. But smaller search engines have come
under attack, just as hyperlinking has, for ``pointing'' to
copyrighted material in currently pending cases in the film and
music industries.

   ``Where Have All the Footnotes Gone?'' the historian Gertrude
Himmelfarb asked in a 1991 essay.(1) At that point, footnotes lucky
enough to survive at all had moved to the backs of books and turned
into less scrutinized endnotes. Annotation was out; breezy,
uninterrupted prose was in.
</P>
<P>
   At around the same time that historians were getting upset at
the decline of footnotes in journals and books, a physicist felt
there had to be a way to improve the referencing system on the

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The slow-moving low pressure system that has brought flooding
rains to parts of the Middle Atlantic and Northeastern states
during the past two days will continue to meander near the
Northeast coast. The steadiest, heaviest rain is expected to shift
into the central and northern New England where a flow of moist air
from the Atlantic will be strong. Elsewhere in the Northeast,
scattered showers will linger in the unseasonably cool air.
</P>
<P>
   Cooler air will spread south across the northern parts of the
Rockies and Plains in the wake of a cold front. Ahead of the front,
scattered thunderstorms will develop from the central Rockies to
the lower Missouri Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Heat will persist across the Southern tier of states. Sunshine
will be plentiful from the southern Plains to the Gulf Coast states
while scattered afternoon thunderstorms will develop in the deserts
of the Southwest.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: HEAT INDEX
</P>
<P>
   The heat index, a warm season analog to wind chill, is an
attempt to quantify the effects on humans of the combination of
warmth and high humidity. In the Northern states, a heat warning is
usually issued when the heat index is forecast to rise above 100 on
consecutive days. When the air has a high moisture content, cooling
by evaporation from the skin is reduced and the stress on the human
body is increased. However, the heat index does not account for
variables such as wind or sunshine, which can contribute to heat
stress. &QL;

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the beginning of this year, the Federal Communications
Commission announced that it was setting up hundreds of free,
low-power radio stations for nonprofit groups across the United
States, in an attempt to increase the diversity of voices on the
airwaves. People were invited to submit requests for a license.
</P>
<P>
   ``Radio is our most ubiquitous mass medium,'' said the FCC
chairman, William E. Kennard, who championed the program. ``People
don't feel they have a local voice'' on the airwaves anymore, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   The response exceeded almost everyone's expectations. Thousands
of groups wrote to the commission expressing interest, and some 750
applied for the 200 or so licenses in the first 10 eligible states.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC envisions as many as a thousand microstations, each with
a broadcast range of 7 miles, and with a combined audience of
millions for an entirely new group of broadcasters. Analysts called
the program potentially the biggest change in the radio industry
since the growth of FM in the 1960s. Perhaps for that very reason,
it has touched off a huge battle in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress, most of them Republican, say that Kennard
is arrogantly trying to create a personal legacy, and they are
seeking a way to block the plan.
</P>
<P>
   They have been joined by the nation's large broadcasters,
including National Public Radio and the National Religious
Broadcasters Association, who claim the new stations would
interfere with the signals of existing stations. Kennard has called
the opposition's arguments a smoke screen designed to shield the
broadcasters from competition.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the fight is the fact that AM and FM radio lack
the variety they had two decades ago, in part because stations
today are likely to be owned by corporations that are located far
away and are relatively indifferent to local issues.
</P>
<P>
   To Gary Williams, the director of music and technical services
at the Good News Church in Augusta, Ga., which has applied for a
license, radio has become nothing but the same ``handful of people
who have a great voice all over our country.''
</P>
<P>
   The applicants for low-power licenses, who want to restore a
local and regional element to the airwaves, are a diverse lot.
Nearly half are churches, and most of those are the kind of
fundamentalist groups often active in conservative politics.
Schools make up about 10 percent of the list, according to Media
Access Project, a Washington law firm. Other applicants include
immigrants' rights groups and a few jazz societies.
</P>
<P>
   Their collective frustration at not hearing their interests and
values on the air is hardly limited to radio; people often tell
pollsters that they feel prosperous but not particularly connected
to their communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a parallel phenomenon to the political one, in which
people don't feel the parties represent them,'' said Michael
Janeway, a Columbia Journalism School professor and the author of
``Republic of Denial'' (Yale University Press, 1999). ``It may take
a populist left turn or a populist right turn, but it's rooted in
the vast distancing that people feel from the mainstream
institutions that used to represent them.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Microradio _ a term popularized by operators of unlicensed,
``pirate'' radio stations and picked up by Kennard, whose agency
had spent years prosecuting them _ offers a chance for people to
set up community broadcast institutions, something that has become
increasingly hard to come by in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Telecommunications Act relaxed ownership rules in
1996, more than half of all radio stations in the United States
have changed hands, said Reed E. Hundt, the FCC's former chairman.
The number of station owners has declined by about 1,000 over the
same period. Last year the largest owner of stations, Clear Channel
Communications, agreed to buy its nearest rival, AMFM Inc., which
will create an 800-station giant.
</P>
<P>
   The companies' new size has given them truly mass audiences for
the first time, making them much more attractive to advertisers.
Deregulation, in turn, has loosened the rules about advertising,
and some stations, having added 10 extra minutes per hour, now
spend almost half of their time broadcasting advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, community groups say, they have a much harder time
getting on the air. ``There are a lot of needs that fall through
the cracks of your commercial radio stations,'' said the Rev. James
A. Burkett of the ChristLife Community Church in Athens, Ga.,
another license applicant.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Puesan, the founding director of a jazz and blues
organization in Washington that is another microradio hopeful,
wants to broadcast jazz 24 hours a day and also help aspiring
musicians in the city raise money and gain exposure. No commercial
radio station in Washington does either now, he said. ``It's
important that we as American citizens get a chance to put
information out there,'' Puesan added.
</P>
<P>
   The debate is particularly important, low-power advocates say,
because of radio's historical mission. When the government first
established rules for television and radio broadcasters earlier in
the century, it limited the number of national networks in order to
set aside a large part of the spectrum for local broadcasters. That
decision, said Akhil Reed Amar, a professor at Yale Law School, had
its roots in the founders' desire to stitch a number of smaller
democracies into a large one.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently the FCC even required stations seeking a renewal
of their licenses to explain how they were filling a need in their
community, noted Ben H. Bagdikian, a prominent critic of media
consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is a chance that low-power radio will quickly
become a moot issue. As more people get access to the Internet and
broadband connections allow for rapid transmission of video and
speech, people seeking a platform for their views will not need a
government license.
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, posting a message in a chat room remains a
poor substitute for broadcasting onto a device that the average
American owns five of.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a radio in every car in the United States,'' said
Hundt, now a consultant at McKinsey &AMP; Co. ``There isn't the
Internet in every car.''

<P>
   At the beginning of this year, the Federal Communications
Commission announced that it was setting up hundreds of free,
low-power radio stations for nonprofit groups across the United
States, in an attempt to increase the diversity of voices on the
airwaves. People were invited to submit requests for a license.
</P>
<P>
   ``Radio is our most ubiquitous mass medium,'' said the FCC
chairman, William E. Kennard, who championed the program. ``People
don't feel they have a local voice'' on the airwaves anymore, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   The response exceeded almost everyone's expectations. Thousands
of groups wrote to the commission expressing interest, and some 750
applied for the 200 or so licenses in the first 10 eligible states.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC envisions as many as a thousand microstations, each with
a broadcast range of 7 miles, and with a combined audience of
millions for an entirely new group of broadcasters. Analysts called
the program potentially the biggest change in the radio industry
since the growth of FM in the 1960s. Perhaps for that very reason,
it has touched off a huge battle in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress, most of them Republican, say that Kennard
is arrogantly trying to create a personal legacy, and they are
seeking a way to block the plan.
</P>
<P>
   They have been joined by the nation's large broadcasters,
including National Public Radio and the National Religious
Broadcasters Association, who claim the new stations would
interfere with the signals of existing stations. Kennard has called
the opposition's arguments a smoke screen designed to shield the
broadcasters from competition.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the fight is the fact that AM and FM radio lack
the variety they had two decades ago, in part because stations
today are likely to be owned by corporations that are located far
away and are relatively indifferent to local issues.
</P>
<P>
   To Gary Williams, the director of music and technical services
at the Good News Church in Augusta, Ga., which has applied for a
license, radio has become nothing but the same ``handful of people
who have a great voice all over our country.''
</P>
<P>
   The applicants for low-power licenses, who want to restore a
local and regional element to the airwaves, are a diverse lot.
Nearly half are churches, and most of those are the kind of
fundamentalist groups often active in conservative politics.
Schools make up about 10 percent of the list, according to Media
Access Project, a Washington law firm. Other applicants include
immigrants' rights groups and a few jazz societies.
</P>
<P>
   Their collective frustration at not hearing their interests and
values on the air is hardly limited to radio; people often tell
pollsters that they feel prosperous but not particularly connected
to their communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a parallel phenomenon to the political one, in which
people don't feel the parties represent them,'' said Michael
Janeway, a Columbia Journalism School professor and the author of
``Republic of Denial'' (Yale University Press, 1999). ``It may take
a populist left turn or a populist right turn, but it's rooted in
the vast distancing that people feel from the mainstream
institutions that used to represent them.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Microradio _ a term popularized by operators of unlicensed,
``pirate'' radio stations and picked up by Kennard, whose agency
had spent years prosecuting them _ offers a chance for people to
set up community broadcast institutions, something that has become
increasingly hard to come by in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Telecommunications Act relaxed ownership rules in
1996, more than half of all radio stations in the United States
have changed hands, said Reed E. Hundt, the FCC's former chairman.
The number of station owners has declined by about 1,000 over the
same period. Last year the largest owner of stations, Clear Channel
Communications, agreed to buy its nearest rival, AMFM Inc., which
will create an 800-station giant.
</P>
<P>
   The companies' new size has given them truly mass audiences for
the first time, making them much more attractive to advertisers.
Deregulation, in turn, has loosened the rules about advertising,
and some stations, having added 10 extra minutes per hour, now
spend almost half of their time broadcasting advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, community groups say, they have a much harder time
getting on the air. ``There are a lot of needs that fall through
the cracks of your commercial radio stations,'' said the Rev. James
A. Burkett of the ChristLife Community Church in Athens, Ga.,
another license applicant.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Puesan, the founding director of a jazz and blues
organization in Washington that is another microradio hopeful,
wants to broadcast jazz 24 hours a day and also help aspiring
musicians in the city raise money and gain exposure. No commercial
radio station in Washington does either now, he said. ``It's
important that we as American citizens get a chance to put
information out there,'' Puesan added.
</P>
<P>
   The debate is particularly important, low-power advocates say,
because of radio's historical mission. When the government first
established rules for television and radio broadcasters earlier in
the century, it limited the number of national networks in order to
set aside a large part of the spectrum for local broadcasters. That
decision, said Akhil Reed Amar, a professor at Yale Law School, had
its roots in the founders' desire to stitch a number of smaller
democracies into a large one.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently the FCC even required stations seeking a renewal
of their licenses to explain how they were filling a need in their
community, noted Ben H. Bagdikian, a prominent critic of media
consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is a chance that low-power radio will quickly
become a moot issue. As more people get access to the Internet and
broadband connections allow for rapid transmission of video and
speech, people seeking a platform for their views will not need a
government license.
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, posting a message in a chat room remains a
poor substitute for broadcasting onto a device that the average
American owns five of.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a radio in every car in the United States,'' said
Hundt, now a consultant at McKinsey &AMP; Co. ``There isn't the
Internet in every car.''
</P>
<P>
   That suggests that even if the opponents of low-power radio win
the current argument over technical problems, the larger question
of who gets to have a voice in a democracy will not go away.

   They mislead each other, although they are supposedly on the
same side. They make decisions that shape the economies of the
world based on disturbingly imperfect information. If they were a
U.S. conglomerate, they would be market pariahs and serious
candidates for Chapter 11.
</P>
<P>
   The subject under discussion is not a failing Eastern European
car manufacturer, but the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, the group that controls the global supply of crude oil,
the commodity that runs the world.
</P>
<P>
   As gasoline prices rose this summer, along with predictions of
how high heating-oil costs would rise this winter, OPEC became a
convenient focus for consumer anger and political point scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas complains that the Clinton
administration has failed to persuade OPEC to ``open the spigots,''
while in Congress lawmakers propose legislation to allow the
Justice Department to investigate the cartel for antitrust
violations. Vice President Al Gore, meanwhile, suggests that Bush
is a tool of the oil industry, which, he says, is gouging
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the angry words, however, the price of oil is
notoriously difficult to micromanage. Controlling oil prices is
``like trying to fly a jumbo jet across the ocean without any
instruments,'' said Leonidas Drollas, chief economist for the
Center for Global Energy Studies, a London research center. ``You
just look out the window and hope for land. You can do it, but it's
rather hazardous.''
</P>
<P>
   OPEC nations have 75 percent of the globe's known oil reserves
and are responsible for 60 percent of the world oil trade.
Nonetheless, OPEC is a fractious and fallible operation, composed
of 12 sovereign states with varied national interests.
</P>
<P>
   The organization has been rife with intrigue and conflict. Nor
does it control the psychology of the world's commodities markets,
a motley community of play-it-safe refineries and airlines and
bet-it-all hedge funds that has a notoriously unpredictable mind of
its own.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC has stumbled many times because the markets weren't willing
to follow its lead. This occurred most recently after OPEC's June
decision to raise output. Contrary to the laws of supply and
demand, raising production actually caused crude oil prices to
increase because the market expected more oil than it got.
</P>
<P>
   ``Price judgments are more an art than a science,'' said Gary N.
Ross, chief executive of PIRA Energy Group, a New York consulting
firm. ``It's a leap to go from the data to the price outlook. You
look not just at inventories, but at market psychology.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest hopes that OPEC might help ease high fuel prices were
stirred two weeks ago when Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of the
cartel, said that it would begin producing an additional 500,000
barrels a day. The rest of OPEC balked, and hurried negotiations
yielded a statement from OPEC and the Saudis that was worded with
the ambiguity of a fortune-cookie message.
</P>
<P>
   As with most OPEC-related decisions in the past, few besides the
Saudis themselves know how they arrived at the
500,000-barrels-a-day calculation. And perhaps no one is certain
how that increase will be reflected in the price of crude oil,
other than the consensus that prices will decline.
</P>
<P>
   When OPEC nations mull over changes in production, they don't
rely on one another for information, because cartel members,
anxious to protect their standing, do not provide reliable
statistics about output and capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want anyone to know that you are at full capacity,
because without excess production you are not a player in OPEC,''
explained Ross. ``You can't threaten anyone. You can't hurt the
price with more production. So what kind of say can you have?''
</P>
<P>
   Even if a member nation is caught cheating, there is no
enforcement mechanism to bring it back into line. For example, in
1997, Venezuela claimed to be producing its allotted 2.3 million
barrels of oil a day, but independent firms had evidence that
Venezuela actually was pumping closer to 3.2 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Saudi oil minister isn't going to publicly call the
Venezuelans a bunch of liars,'' said one European oil economist,
who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Instead, OPEC raised
Venezuela's overall output, a bit of sleight of hand that allowed
the cartel to save face.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the OPEC nations have attempted to act in a more
consultative, cohesive manner, but it remains difficult for the
group to manage the oil market, or even measure it accurately.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much oil is produced in the world? No one knows for
sure,'' said a senior economist with a Western oil company, who
also spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``It's like asking how
many cabbages are sold in New York every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Many oil-producing nations are in the developing world, and they
lack the interest and resources to gauge oil production accurately.
They report data months, if not years, late. Private companies
track exports by following how much crude oil is bought from
producing nations by major oil companies, or by following the
tanker traffic in major ports. All have secret industry sources as
well, but the resulting figures are merely estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The industrialized nations, too, must regularly revise their
data for production, demand and inventories of crude and refined
fuels, a critical indicator of the balance between supply and
demand.
</P>
<P>
   Daily inventory figures may be off by 1.6 million barrels a day,
according to David Knapp, head of the oil division at the
Paris-based International Energy Association. It's a troubling
discrepancy ``when the markets are swinging based on decisions to
increase output by a few hundred thousand,'' Knapp said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Of course, no one ever has perfect information about any market;
guessing is part of the game. But since oil is so important and the
price so volatile, the price of guessing wrong can be enormous. For
example, OPEC increased production in late 1998, just days before
the Asian financial crisis. As Asian demand for oil dried up, the
production increase flooded the world with crude and prices went
into a free fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought Asia would always stay a dynamo,'' said Falah
Aljibury, a California-based oil analyst close to OPEC. ``They
didn't ask the right questions. If they had had more timely
information, it might have made a difference.''

<P>
   A collective groan rose up from the United Airlines check-in
line at La Guardia Airport at 8 a.m. Monday as the announcement
sounded from a loudspeaker. Because of heavy thunderstorms in
Chicago, the disembodied voice intoned, flights to O'Hare
International Airport would be delayed one to four hours.
</P>
<P>
   For Sharon Mantel, a drug saleswoman on her way to a meeting in
Chicago, the day had already had a bad start. She hit a deer on her
way to the airport from her home in Stamford, Conn., shattering her
car's windshield.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days earlier, Jacqueline and Philip Clinton and their
daughters, Caitlyn, 2, and Victoria, 3 months, had arrived four
hours late _ without their luggage _ on their way to Long Island
from their home in Spokane, Wash. Now, rescheduled onto an
afternoon flight to Denver, they faced an even longer trip back.
</P>
<P>
   But for Cindy Miller, an advertising executive who has been
flying at least once a week for four years, it was business as
usual. ``It's just absolutely horrendous,'' she said. ``You just
get used to it after a while. What can you do?''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer was the worst on record for airline delays,
prompting the airlines and the Federal Aviation Administration to
swing into action to try to ease the burden on weary passengers.
Yet despite those efforts, this summer is turning out to be even
worse.
</P>
<P>
   Delays in June rose 16.5 percent from June 1999, according to
the FAA's latest statistics. So far this year they are up 12.7
percent. And with air traffic continuing to expand at a time when
few new airports or runways are on the drawing board, delays may be
a fact of life for years to come, airline executives and government
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   No group of passengers has suffered more of late than those
flying United, the world's largest airline. Just under 57 percent
of the carrier's flights arrived on time in May, far worse than the
performance of its closest competitors, according to the latest
figures compiled by the Department of Transportation. Of the 33
flights that were late more than 80 percent of the time in May, 27
were United's. And United canceled more flights in May _ nearly 9
percent of its schedule _ than any other airline.
</P>
<P>
   May was also the month that United agreed to buy US Airways, the
country's sixth-largest carrier, for $4.3 billion, a deal that
would make it responsible for carrying 25 percent of the country's
air passengers. Many politicians and consumer advocates oppose the
deal _ which has set off a frenzy of merger negotiations among the
other major airlines _ saying it will lead to a decline in both
competition and service.
</P>
<P>
   United blames a stretch of unusually bad weather and an outmoded
air traffic control system that it and other airlines complain is
not up to the task of managing an air transport network carrying
twice as many passengers as it did 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But there is more at work, too _ United's deteriorating
relations with its employees, for example. Six years ago, the
airline's pilots led a group of employees that traded deep wage
cuts and other concessions for stock in United's parent company,
the UAL Corp., making UAL the world's largest employee-owned
company.
</P>
<P>
   Without a new contract since April, many of the pilots have
refused to fly overtime, forcing the airline to cancel thousands of
flights. Both sides say they want to reach an agreement, but the
labor picture could get worse before it gets better: On Wednesday,
the contract covering United's mechanics, gate agents and ramp
workers expired.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything our folks are doing is inconveniencing passengers,
I am truly sorry,'' said Herb Hunter, a 777 captain and spokesman
for the United branch of the Air Line Pilots Association. ``That
can all be fixed if the company would step up and try to take care
of its employees.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for United's difficulties, according to
conversations with dozens of employees and executives over the last
week, is that many of its internal systems, from its arrival and
departure information boards to its baggage handling operations,
have not kept pace with the airline's fast growth.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday was a typical example of United's travails. At 5:30
a.m., violent thunderstorms converged on O'Hare, and the FAA
quickly reduced the number of arrivals there to 40 an hour from the
normal 100.
</P>
<P>
   With that information in hand, under a new program that puts the
FAA and the airlines in closer contact, United began canceling
flights. Like other major airlines, it uses a sophisticated
computer program that determines which flights will cause the least
disruption to passengers and the system if they are grounded.
Ultimately, United canceled 354 of its 2,300 scheduled flights on
Monday, 231 because of weather and air traffic control delays and
the remainder for mechanical problems, unavailable flight crews and
other reasons.
</P>
<P>
   By acting early, said Peter D. McDonald, United's vice president
for operations, United can get word out to passengers about delays
and cancellations. But it does not always work out that way. The
Clintons _ she is a freelance artist, he is an Air Force pilot _
checked with the airline at 6 a.m. Monday before heading to La
Guardia from Wading River on Long Island, where they were staying,
and were told there were no delays. By then, of course, storms were
threatening Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can predict four hours into the future,'' asked
Clinton, ``why couldn't they tell us at 6 a.m.?''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald said that even if United could have correctly forecast
the storms, it would not have been able to anticipate every delay.
``You can predict the weather and you can predict a thunderstorm,
but you can't predict what the FAA will do with the arrival rate,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Customer surveys conducted by United have found that the top
priority of passengers, after arriving safely on time, is getting
accurate information from the airline. Yet because many of United's
computer systems do not communicate with one another, its
front-line employees often are in the dark when flights are
delayed.
</P>
<P>
   Asked at 8:40 a.m. how long the Clintons' original 9 a.m. flight
would be delayed, Willy Pena, a United customer service
representative at La Guardia, looked at a computer screen and said
20 minutes _ despite the earlier warning of delays up to four
hours.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the flight took off more than two hours late, at
11:40 a.m. ``It is difficult to prove the point that we are not
lying,'' acknowledged Graham Atkinson, United's senior vice
president of marketing. ``But it may be that certain people at the
airline may not know what other people know.''
</P>
<P>
   United plans to introduce a system _ at O'Hare by the end of the
summer and systemwide next year _ that will link customer service
representatives, gate agents and arrival and departure monitors
directly to its main operations center in Chicago. Now, the
information they receive has to be updated manually _ which means
that visitors to United's Web site or customers who sign up for its
new paging service, both already connected to the new system,
receive more current information than United's own call center and
airport personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Antiquated systems are also the reason United loses more baggage
than any other airline. In May, it mishandled 6.71 bags per 1,000
passengers, more than twice the number lost by top-rated Alaska
Airlines, according to the government.
</P>
<P>
   John Johnson, who is in charge of deploying baggage handlers at
O'Hare and has worked at United for 31 years, recalled a big
celebration a few years ago when the airline handled a record
51,000 passengers at the airport in one day. Now United routinely
handles that many at O'Hare, its busiest hub, and 55,000 to 60,000
a day is common, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen it this bad before,'' Johnson added. ``This
year is incredible, and I said the same thing about last year.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In April, United began trying to hire another 600 baggage
handlers at O'Hare. Frontline workers there are being outfitted
with radios, and the company is installing scanners around its
system to let it more closely track bags. Also, a new baggage
connection center that is due to open at O'Hare early next year
will link baggage operations directly to customer service. The goal
is for bags to accompany passengers rerouted because of delays,
something that rarely happens now.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask the Clintons. After their flight from Spokane to Denver
was delayed on July 1, the family was put on a later connecting
flight to La Guardia. But their luggage _ including car seats for
their daughters _ did not make it to the new flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't leave the airport,'' Clinton said. Not, at least,
until her parents arrived with car seats they purchased on the way
to La Guardia (which the Clintons returned to the store after their
luggage was delivered by United the following evening).
</P>
<P>
   Their trip home last Monday was even more harrowing. To avoid
the delays at O'Hare, they were taken off the 9 a.m. flight to
Chicago and rebooked on a 2:40 p.m. flight to Denver. After waiting
at La Guardia for nearly four hours, they were delayed more than
five hours more in Denver before taking off for Spokane. The family
finally landed _ with luggage, this time _ after midnight Tuesday
morning, more than 10 hours late.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the experience has not dimmed her husband's enthusiasm
for the skies; he hopes to work for an airline after he finishes
his service in the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won't be flying with a 2-year-old and a baby,'' his wife
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Clinton said. ``That's why I might try to fly for
Fedex. No passengers.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There is a dirty little secret in American arms
control circles these days: No one really knows where the nation's
nuclear doctrine is headed.
</P>
<P>
   The principal arguments heard here are for or against missile
defenses, and about strategies to fight the spread of nuclear
weapons. One might think that underlying all of them is a solid
understanding of why the United States and Russia have the number
and types of nuclear-tipped missiles that they have.
</P>
<P>
   But that is hardly the case. The United States and Russia are
still pointing thousands of missiles at each other (setting
examples for imitators from Pakistan to India), even though Moscow
and Washington no longer fight for the world's hearts and minds and
threaten global extinction in the process.
</P>
<P>
   These missiles were designed for a different age, and no one has
exactly figured out how many are still needed, how to think about
them and where the Pentagon should point them today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't rethought the purposes of nuclear weapons since the
end of the Cold War,'' said Michael Krepon, president of the Henry
L. Stimson Center, a research group.
</P>
<P>
   That is in the background as President Clinton prepares to
decide whether to begin building a $60 billion defensive system to
protect the United States against limited missile attacks, and as
he weighs last week's failed test of the system.
</P>
<P>
   If one could design a system from scratch to defend against a
resurgent Russia some day, it would presumably look quite different
from the one in place now. Krepon said he would allow for a system
of unlimited defenses and tightly constrained offensive weapons.
Other experts would recommend a defense that intercepted missiles
just after launching, rather than in space. The notion of nuclear
deterrence _ and, by implication, massive retaliation _ still
enjoys bipartisan support, but some critics say the uncertainty
about what might deter a so-called rogue state makes missile
defenses necessary. Others say deterrence is immoral.
</P>
<P>
   Those options illustrate how the question of the
Russian-American missile balance affects every aspect of nuclear
proliferation and defensive missile strategy. Imagining a different
balance among the nuclear superpowers, one can also imagine how
differently a potential little nuclear power like North Korea _or a
medium-size one like China _ might see itself fitting in.
</P>
<P>
   Not that there is any wide agreement on what effect an effort to
create a missile defense might have. Many experts say it would just
complicate efforts to stop proliferation, by tempting potential
enemies into building up their forces to overwhelm the defense.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there has never been anything obvious about the proper
nuclear strategy to adopt. Even during the Cold War, American
strategic doctrine steadily evolved, from one of large-scale
retaliation in the 1950s to a focus on obtaining arms control
accords, starting in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Today, just as NATO's relevance came under scrutiny after the
collapse of Communism, so too have traditional theories of arms
control.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive Republican
presidential nominee, suggested a break from decades of strategic
theology when he said he would consider deep unilateral cuts in
American warheads while building robust defenses to be shared with
European allies and, perhaps, one day with Russia or China.
</P>
<P>
   In suggesting that, Bush repudiated a governing assumption of
American arms control that the ability of each side to annihilate
the other created a safer world by making the temptation to use
nuclear weapons unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you agree with missile defenses or not, what Bush did
was quite important,'' said Robert A. Manning, the director of Asia
Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, who said he has
informally advised the Bush campaign. ``He was overturning a
paradigm of the Cold War, and saying Russia is not a problem, why
target them?''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the roughly 2,200 Russian targets in the Pentagon's
strategic war plan are based on assumptions about the way
policy-makers expect Russia to behave. The United States still
presumes a series of nuclear exchanges based on exceptionally deep
rivalries and differences. That may have been true 20 years ago,
but is it still true now?
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration acknowledges the paradox, but says
it's still prudent to keep a hedge. In a report last September, the
intelligence community concluded: ``The Russian threat, although
significantly reduced, will continue to be the most robust and
lethal.''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the Pentagon brass is wary of cutting America's atomic
stockpile below 2,000 to 2,500 warheads, as proposed under the
strategic arms agreement known as Start III. ``These forces
represent our nation's ultimate insurance policy,'' Adm. Richard W.
Mies, who heads the military's strategic forces, told senators in
June. ``Nuclear weapons help keep the Cold War cold.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a curious phrase. Is there still a Cold War? Does the
strategy still work the same way?
</P>
<P>
   One thing that has certainly changed is the clear American
advantage in conventional weaponry over all its potential
adversaries, and even over its allies. Some conservatives who are
eager to erect an extensive missile defense have begun to argue
that deterrence as a strategy is immoral, and irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would we really incinerate every Iraqi because of some action
by Saddam Hussein?'' asked Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz. ``I'm not sure we
would, and I'm not sure we should.''
</P>
<P>
   For many conservatives, missile defense has become a new
orthodoxy. But they say Clinton's proposal to shield the United
States from only a handful of missiles _ from countries like North
Korea, Iran and Iraq _ is ill conceived.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., a staunch supporter of arms control,
counters that so long as an effective missile defense does not
create more diplomatic problems than it solves, it could lessen the
ability of a small, hostile nuclear power to threaten the West with
nuclear blackmail.
</P>
<P>
   But critics argue that any missile defenses will upset
deterrence's delicate balance. Moscow fears that even a small
system would be a step toward a larger one that Russia could not
afford to match. So it is threatening to freeze arms cuts if
Washington bolts the treaty, as Bush has suggested he might do.
</P>
<P>
   And China's top arms control negotiator warned last week that
Beijing's arms control and nonproliferation agreements with the
West could be imperiled. China now has only a handful of long-range
missiles; an American missile defense might encourage the Chinese
to seek parity with the American and Russian arsenals, many experts
say, adding that if China ratchets up its nuclear arsenal, it's a
safe bet that India and Pakistan will quickly follow. Which leads
back to why Russia and America have their arsenals. Without an
obvious rationale for that, it is only more difficult to persuade
New Delhi or Islamabad to curb their own nuclear appetites.

   Startling as life in the subatomic realm can seem, with
particles existing both here and there or darting to and fro at the
same time, people have been able to take some small comfort in
knowing that the ``real'' world doesn't work that way. Though made
of the very same stuff that marches to the dictates of quantum
theory _ the laws that explain how particles behave _ solid objects
obediently occupy one place at a time and are never seen moving in
two directions at once. It may be hard to tell whether a torpid
cat, barely blinking its eyes, remains among the living. But that
is a far cry from the mythical cat in the physicist Erwin
Schroedinger's oft-recited thought experiment, which is placed in a
state of being dead and alive at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   When quantum rules are applied to the domain of creatures and
things, the result is nonsense. ``When I hear about Schroedinger's
Cat,'' Stephen Hawking once grumpily declared, ``I reach for my
gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the taunting feline (along with the image of Hawking
pulling a revolver from a holster on his wheelchair and blasting
the poor kitty to bits) was evoked once again. Experimenters at the
State University of New York at Stony Brook showed more decisively
than ever that quantum effects can indeed exist in the larger world
_ you just have to know how to look for them.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most pressing questions in science is why the
universe seems to operate according to two sets of laws. If
scientists are so sure of quantum theory, one of their proudest
creations, then why is it so flagrantly spurned here in the
ordinary world? The new experiment may nudge theorists closer to an
answer.
</P>
<P>
   While physicists have yet to produce a quantum cat or even a
quantum microbe, the Stony Brook team showed that a tiny wire loop
a little wider than a human hair _ but monstrous by subatomic
standards _ can indeed hover in the kind of ambiguous state
Schroedinger puzzled over. As reported in the British journal
Nature, the researchers cooled the ring to near absolute zero and
showed that a current consisting of billions of electrons could be
coaxed to spin around it in two directions at once, clockwise and
counterclockwise.
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists had already demonstrated that single atoms or
molecules could be placed in the catlike condition known as quantum
superposition. By achieving what is known in the trade as a
macroscopic quantum state, the Stony Brook researchers have raised
the bar much higher. As a headline in Nature put it,
``Schroedinger's cat is now fat.''
</P>
<P>
   Most physicists, in fact, are surer than ever that everything,
no matter how portly, is quantum at heart. Why then don't we see
these weird juxtapositions?
</P>
<P>
   In Schroedinger's fantasy, a cat is placed in a box with a vial
of deadly hydrogen cyanide gas and a lump of some radioactive
substance like uranium. If the uranium decays, it will shoot out a
piece of nuclear shrapnel, triggering a Rube Goldberg device that
smashes the vial and releases the poison. With a 50-50 chance that
this reaction will occur, Schroedinger proposed, the cat could be
thought of as being simultaneously dead and alive.
</P>
<P>
   Schroedinger was perfectly aware that when he opened the box and
peered inside, the cat would have to be one way or the other. Some
physicists have proposed that it is the very act of observation
that conjures up the hard edges of the familiar world. Most
theorists insist that the observation need not be made by a
conscious being _ an insentient measuring device will do. Hook an
electroencephalograph to the cat to monitor its brainwaves and the
continuous act of measurement would keep it from slipping into
quantum limbo. Or would the EEG itself fall into an ambiguous
state, its needle twitching out ``dead'' and ``alive'' at the same
time? Then something would have to observe  &UR; it &LR; . Dr. Hawking, get
your gun.
</P>
<P>
   It has been tempting to think that as things get bigger, quantum
effects somehow disappear on their own. But that begs the question
of where nature draws the line. With more and more evidence that
size doesn't matter, other ideas are gaining ground. Maybe the
quantum fuzz snaps into focus when a collection of particles passes
some threshold of complexity.
</P>
<P>
   Most bets now are being laid on a different possibility: that it
is simply the interaction with an environment that solidifies the
macroscopic world. The particles that make up the cat are
constantly jostling each other and being bombarded with air
molecules and photons of light. These tiny ``measurements'' may be
all that's needed to keep Schroedinger's Cat at bay.
</P>
<P>
   The feline would be in good company, with everything in the
universe _ stars and trees as well as scientists _ engaged in a
buzzing orgy of mutual measurement, keeping the cosmos in line.

</P>
<P>
   When quantum rules are applied to the domain of creatures and
things, the result is nonsense. ``When I hear about Schroedinger's
Cat,'' Stephen Hawking once grumpily declared, ``I reach for my
gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the taunting feline (along with the image of Hawking
pulling a revolver from a holster on his wheelchair and blasting
the poor kitty to bits) was evoked once again. Experimenters at the
State University of New York at Stony Brook showed more decisively
than ever that quantum effects can indeed exist in the larger world
_ you just have to know how to look for them.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most pressing questions in science is why the
universe seems to operate according to two sets of laws. If
scientists are so sure of quantum theory, one of their proudest
creations, then why is it so flagrantly spurned here in the
ordinary world? The new experiment may nudge theorists closer to an
answer.
</P>
<P>
   While physicists have yet to produce a quantum cat or even a
quantum microbe, the Stony Brook team showed that a tiny wire loop
a little wider than a human hair _ but monstrous by subatomic
standards _ can indeed hover in the kind of ambiguous state
Schroedinger puzzled over. As reported in the British journal
Nature, the researchers cooled the ring to near absolute zero and
showed that a current consisting of billions of electrons could be
coaxed to spin around it in two directions at once, clockwise and
counterclockwise.
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists had already demonstrated that single atoms or
molecules could be placed in the catlike condition known as quantum
superposition. By achieving what is known in the trade as a
macroscopic quantum state, the Stony Brook researchers have raised
the bar much higher. As a headline in Nature put it,
``Schroedinger's cat is now fat.''
</P>
<P>
   Most physicists, in fact, are surer than ever that everything,
no matter how portly, is quantum at heart. Why then don't we see
these weird juxtapositions?
</P>
<P>
   In Schroedinger's fantasy, a cat is placed in a box with a vial
of deadly hydrogen cyanide gas and a lump of some radioactive
substance like uranium. If the uranium decays, it will shoot out a
piece of nuclear shrapnel, triggering a Rube Goldberg device that
smashes the vial and releases the poison. With a 50-50 chance that
this reaction will occur, Schroedinger proposed, the cat could be
thought of as being simultaneously dead and alive.
</P>
<P>
   Schroedinger was perfectly aware that when he opened the box and
peered inside, the cat would have to be one way or the other. Some
physicists have proposed that it is the very act of observation
that conjures up the hard edges of the familiar world. Most
theorists insist that the observation need not be made by a
conscious being _ an insentient measuring device will do. Hook an
electroencephalograph to the cat to monitor its brainwaves and the
continuous act of measurement would keep it from slipping into
quantum limbo. Or would the EEG itself fall into an ambiguous
state, its needle twitching out ``dead'' and ``alive'' at the same
time? Then something would have to observe  &UR; it &LR; . Dr. Hawking, get
your gun.
</P>
<P>
   It has been tempting to think that as things get bigger, quantum
effects somehow disappear on their own. But that begs the question
of where nature draws the line. With more and more evidence that
size doesn't matter, other ideas are gaining ground. Maybe the
quantum fuzz snaps into focus when a collection of particles passes
some threshold of complexity.
</P>
<P>
   Most bets now are being laid on a different possibility: that it
is simply the interaction with an environment that solidifies the
macroscopic world. The particles that make up the cat are
constantly jostling each other and being bombarded with air
molecules and photons of light. These tiny ``measurements'' may be
all that's needed to keep Schroedinger's Cat at bay.
</P>
<P>
   The feline would be in good company, with everything in the
universe _ stars and trees as well as scientists _ engaged in a
buzzing orgy of mutual measurement, keeping the cosmos in line.

   An Enormous Award for Smoking Damages
</P>
<P>
   After a two-year trial, a six-member jury in a state circuit
court in Miami ordered the tobacco industry to pay $145 billion in
punitive damages to Florida smokers who have become ill. The award
shattered previous records for the size of a punitive damages
verdict, and a lawyer for the plaintiffs in the class-action suit
called it a ``day of reckoning'' for Big Tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   But spokesmen for the tobacco companies quickly predicted that
the sheer size of the award, which they said they could not pay,
would make it untenable. Philip Morris Inc. was ordered to pay the
largest amount, $73.96 billion; the other defendants were Lorillard
Tobacco Co., Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.,
Liggett Group Inc. and the industry's defunct Council for Tobacco
Research and Tobacco Institute.

investment rules that most of its Asian neighbors follow. Hanoi
hopes the agreement will lift its stagnant economy and allow the
communist bureaucracy to develop a more investor-friendly image.

   Concert promoters had high hopes for what was billed as the

They paid the former Supreme Diana Ross a guarantee reported to be
between $15 million and $20 million and set a top ticket price
around $250.
</P>
<P>
   But none of Ross' surviving former bandmates deigned to join her
on the tour, claiming that their pay was too minuscule compared

<P>
   Though a date at Madison Square Garden on July 8 sold out, other
arenas have been half or even three-quarters empty. Last week, Ross
issued a press release stating that the tour had been canceled
against her will. But SFX, the tour's promoter, despite calling off
almost every concert at the last minute since then, claims that the
tour is still happening, leaving ticket-holders grumbling, ``You

   A New Old Building
</P>
<P>
   Seventy years after it was built in New York as the tallest
building in the world (a title it held only briefly), the 77-story
art deco masterpiece known as the Chrysler Building may get a
chance to reclaim proper title to its name.
</P>
<P>
   The skyscraper was built by Walter P. Chrysler, founder of
Chrysler Corp., who once had offices and a private dining room
there. But after he died in 1940 the company's use of the building
fell off and it was sold. Now, DaimlerChrysler AG, the
predominantly German-managed company into which Chrysler Corp. was
merged in 1988, said it was hoping to rent and renovate space in
the building as a ``virtual headquarters'' where its board would
meet and investor and public relations staffs would work.

McKenzie, to be elected a bishop of the African Methodist Episcopal
Church, the nation's oldest black denomination and now the first to
have a woman bishop. As one of 20 AME bishops, she will have a
prestigious post that she will likely hold until mandatory
retirement in 20 years. She will spend her first four years
supervising AME churches in southern Africa. Triumphant after the
election at the church's quadrennial convention in Cincinnati, she
said from the podium, ``The stained glass ceiling has been
pierced.''

   A Grim AIDS Conference
</P>
<P>
   Dashing the hopes of thousands of scientists gathered in Durban,
South Africa, for the 13th International Aids Conference, President
Thabo Mbeki singled out extreme poverty, rather than AIDS, as the
biggest killer in Africa. Mbeki has stirred a furor by entertaining
the theory that poverty, not the HIV virus, causes AIDS _ an
argument that most scientists say was debunked years ago.
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes the link between poverty and AIDS. But many
scientists fear that Mbeki's comments will fuel confusion among
ordinary people who may assume they can continue risky sexual
behavior because the president has questioned whether HIV causes
AIDS.

   Go Play With Your Food, Dear
</P>
<P>
   Some child-development theory has long held that children's play
is their work and their food is their play. So when executives at
H.J. Heinz wanted to sell more ketchup, they zeroed in on its
potential entertainment value. They came up with not just a bottle
that is easier to squeeze (and draw pictures with), but also
another color _ leafy green.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate America being what it is, the subject of playing with
one's food was presented not very playfully at all. ``Kids had a
particular need at mealtime that wasn't being met,'' said Deb
Magness, a spokeswoman for Heinz. ``It was about having better
control and more fun.''
</P>
<P>
   It's one more sign of how children are driving decisions large
and small, from the purchase of the family car to the packaging of
food. But at Heinz, the ketchup (which is still made from tomatoes)
seemed to have some appeal to grown-ups, too. A board meeting last
week featured a few bottles of green ketchup, all of which seem to
have gone home with the directors. ``I never saw a product
disappear out of a boardroom so fast,'' said Ted Smyth, a
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Not far off: a rainbow of ketchup. ``We felt green had a little
more kitchen logic to it,'' said Casey Keller, Heinz's managing
director for ketchup, ``but the idea is to keep it fresh. Over
time, we'll look at other colors.''

A SPECIAL REPORT: FALLOUT IN ARMS RESEARCH  
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES GLANZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Asian and Asian-American scientists are staying away from jobs
at national weapons laboratories, particularly Los Alamos, saying
that researchers of Asian descent are systematically harassed and
denied advancement because of their race.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has long simmered at the laboratories, but it came to
a boil last year with the arrest of Wen Ho Lee, who is accused of
mishandling nuclear secrets at Los Alamos. Though officials
vehemently deny it, many Asian-Americans said Lee, a naturalized
citizen born in Taiwan, was singled out because of his ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Asians and Asian-Americans said, security
procedures implemented after Lee's arrest fall hardest on them.
Since the arrest, some scholarly groups have even called for a
boycott of the laboratories, urging Asian and Asian-American
scientists not to apply for jobs with them.
</P>
<P>
   Whether because of the calls for a boycott, the underlying
claims of discrimination or both, all three national weapons
laboratories _ Los Alamos, Lawrence Livermore and Sandia _ have
seen declines in Asian and Asian-American applicants for
postdoctoral positions, according to their own statistics. Other
Asian and Asian-American scientists have left voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   Los Alamos, for example, has seen the number of Asian applicants
(those granted formal reviews by committees) dwindle to three in
the first half of 2000 from an average of 28 in 1998 and 1999. The
number accepting jobs at Los Alamos fell from 18 in 1998 to nine in
1999 to three in the first half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The combined acceptances of Asians and Asian-Americans at Sandia
and Livermore, which compile statistics by fiscal years ending in
late September, are similar to Los Alamos, falling to three so far
in 2000 from 21 in 1998. At Los Alamos, the number of Asians
applying for jobs declined in percentage as well, to 4 percent of
total applications from 12 percent in 1998. Over all, postdoctoral
appointments of Asians and Asian-Americans fell to 7 percent from
14 percent when the three laboratories, with their slightly
different record keeping, are combined.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, this is an indicator that some of the best have decided
either not to apply, or even when they do apply, not to come when
they're offered a position,'' said John C. Browne, director of Los
Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   The decline is troubling for two reasons. First, Asians and
Asian-Americans represent a huge pool of talent _ more than a
quarter of all Ph.D.s awarded in science and technology at U.S.
universities each year. Second, postdoctoral appointments, which
are generally filled by researchers who have recently earned
Ph.D.s, are an essential source of candidates for permanent
positions. The appointments constitute ``the primary means of
recruiting future scientists and engineers for Los Alamos,'' said
Jim Danneskiold, a spokesman for the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the National Science Foundation, a major source of
research money, reported that ``heightened security concerns'' at
the laboratories were hindering efforts to recruit and retain Asian
and Asian-American scientists.
</P>
<P>
   And this month, speaking before a panel of the House Armed
Services Committee on reorganizing the Energy Department, Rep.
Ellen O. Tauscher, D-Calif., referred to suspicions of racial
profiling at Livermore and Sandia.
</P>
<P>
   Tauscher said there was ``the sense that Asian-Americans are
targeted or scapegoated as potentially coming to work at the labs
because they can spy,'' adding that the problem ``has a deleterious
effect on our ability to recruit and retain.''
</P>
<P>
   Observers say they are not surprised by the comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question in my mind that the Asian-Americans are
conscientiously avoiding working in Los Alamos and the other labs
like the plague,'' said Prof. L. Ling-chi Wang, chairman of the
department of ethnic studies and director of the Asian American
studies program at the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Two organizations, the Asian Pacific Americans in Higher
Education and the Association for Asian American Studies, have
called for a boycott, urging Asian-Americans not to work at the
laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Wang, who helped organize the boycott calls, is not alone in
thinking that they have contributed to the flight from the
laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Browne said that an ``overall black cloud'' caused by the
boycott was driving Asian and Asian-American scientists away, but
said that he did not believe racial profiling had occurred at Los
Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to say whether anger over security measures is
the sole reason for the sharp drop in Asian and Asian-American
applicants, particularly with laboratory budget cuts and a booming
economy creating lucrative jobs in private industry. But the impact
is apparent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The labs are falling apart,'' said Jonathan Medalia, a
specialist in national defense at the Congressional Research
Service and the author of a study on the laboratories, which he
presented at a conference but has not yet delivered to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The loss of talent is most severe in computer science, Medalia
said, and if it continues, could threaten the nation's ability to
ensure the safety and reliability of its nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   He said that tightened security measures increased the losses
among all ethnic groups, but that the economy and other effects
contributed.
</P>
<P>
   Accusations of racism have also led to formal complaints.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In December, nine Asian-American scientists and engineers at
Livermore filed a discrimination complaint with the state of
California that the California Department of Fair Employment and
Housing is investigating.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has also
begun an investigation, said officials at the laboratory and a
lawyer for the scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson, whose agency oversees the
laboratories, conceded that political pressures from Congress had
created ``an atmosphere of fear'' among foreign-born scientists.

   A year ago, Richardson named a committee to investigate
complaints of racial profiling, and he appointed Jeremy Wu, a
former official in the Agriculture Department's office of civil
rights, as the department's ombudsman to review diversity issues
and hear employee complaints. But the problems are so ingrained,
scientists said, that those measures are not enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, a lot of these things have festered, and it was
typical of the Asian way to say nothing,'' said Kalina Wong, a
U.S.-born scientist of Chinese and Hawaiian descent who tracks
inventories of nuclear materials at Livermore, and one of the
employees who filed the complaint. Now, Wong said, ``Pandora's Box
is open.''
</P>
<P>
   Laboratory officials deny any systematic discrimination. If
anything, they said, administrators are eager to promote members of
ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   The new security directives do not explicitly mention
Asian-Americans or any other group; moreover, Richardson
accompanied the directives with a warning that they should not be
seen as an excuse to question the ``loyalty and patriotism'' of
Asian-Americans as a group.
</P>
<P>
   But the directives required scientists to report ``close and
continuing contact'' with nationals of sensitive countries _ a
designation that covers Russia and most countries in Asia, but few
countries in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have relatives in sensitive countries, you are under
the microscope,'' said Aaron Lai, a climate researcher at Los
Alamos and a naturalized citizen born in Taiwan. ``Before the Wen
Ho Lee case, the chance of getting promoted was very low,'' Lai
said. But with the new rules, he said, ``it's getting worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel Wong, an engineer at Livermore, who is from Hong Kong and
is now a U.S. citizen, said, ``They associate foreign-born with
being a threat.''

   The 19-member committee appointed by Richardson issued a report
earlier this year based on interviews with workers. Its
recommendations included appointing an ombudsman, as Richardson has
done, and compiling data on minority groups across the department.
Existing data are sketchy at best. The report also described
pervasive feelings of unease and fear.
</P>
<P>
   In October, the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus
heard from several scientists who said Asian-Americans faced
discrimination at the laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Wong, the Livermore scientist, told the group of a lagging
salary, racially insensitive comments from officials, her removal
from sensitive projects and an unexplained erosion of authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole Chinese spy allegation has set us back further,''
said Wong, whose family has been in the United States for five
generations and who has worked at Livermore for more than two
decades. ``It seems now that there is license to do as was done to
me because we Asians are potential spies.''
</P>
<P>
   Livermore officials said racial bias has not played a role in
the treatment of scientists, either before or after the Lee case.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no underlying discrimination,'' a Livermore
spokeswoman, Susan Houghton, said. ``If anything, it's the
opposite. It is still very much a goal to increase minority
representation in management.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Houghton and Tommy Smith, a mechanical engineer
who is the laboratory's director of affirmative action and
diversity, said Livermore had established goals for increasing the
numbers of Asians and other minorities in management and held a
one-day workshop for employees in April. ``Obviously, we can always
do a better job,'' Houghton said.
</P>
<P>
   She also noted that the investigations into discrimination
claims were not proof of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Los Alamos has about 7,000 employees, including 3,500
scientists, said Danneskiold, the laboratory spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Asians or Pacific Islanders make up 2.4 percent of the
staff and about 4 percent of the scientists, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But of 99 senior managers, only one is of Asian descent,
Danneskiold said. And of 322 leaders of technical groups, a lower
rung in management, only three are Asian-American.
</P>
<P>
   Similar if somewhat less pronounced disparities exist at
Livermore; at Sandia, the proportion of Asians in management and
the laboratory are nearly the same.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Trujillo, the equal employment opportunity officer at
Los Alamos, also rejected the idea that Asian-Americans' relatively
low representation in management was a result of bias. But Trujillo
said he could not offer an explanation. ``I don't think that
there's an easy answer on that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department ombudsman, Wu, said in an interview that
he believed new security rules had infringed on ``individual rights
and scientific freedom'' and added that he hoped he could improve
the situation.
</P>
<P>
   He has been on the job since January, but he began visiting the
laboratories last year and has already investigated several bias
complaints. In two cases, involving the loss of a security
clearance and the termination of a grant, rulings against Asian and
Asian-American scientists have been overturned, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Edward J. Curran, who directs the Energy Department's
counterintelligence office, said a review almost two years ago led
to increased reporting requirements for many employees and to
polygraph testing of some scientists. He said the rules were
intended to make intelligence officials aware of any unusual
inquiries from foreign nationals and to help catch any U.S.
scientists who were spying, whatever their ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   Among the directives are two that Richardson issued last July in
which scientists are required to report certain ``close and
continuing contact'' during unclassified visits with people from
countries deemed sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   Al West, a security director at Sandia, said that at least one
Asian-American scientist, whose fiancee was from Hong Kong, left
for a longstanding job offer in private industry ``because they got
tired of dealing with all the inquiries into their personal
affairs'' as a result of the new rule.
</P>
<P>
   And Shao-Ping Chen, a physicist at Los Alamos, criticized a
requirement to list all contacts and relationships with people in
sensitive countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where it should stop is not easy to tell,'' said Chen,
originally from Taiwan but now a U.S. citizen. ``If you have a big
family, those people are large numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry Tang, chairman of the Committee of 100, a group of
Chinese-Americans engaged in public policy issues, said that in
enforcing the new rules, security officials ``are no different than
a highway patrolman suspecting someone merely by virtue of their
physical characteristics.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul D. Moore, who was the FBI's chief of Chinese
counterintelligence analysis for more than 20 years and is now at
the Center for Counterintelligence and Security Studies, a
nongovernmental training center in Alexandria, Va., said that
belief was mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   But Moore said that it had ultimately taken root because, in his
view, the Chinese government specifically courts ethnic Chinese in
the United States when looking for potential spies. As a result, he
said, counterintelligence agents focus on Chinese-Americans. ``It's
unfair,'' he said, ``but what are you going to do?''
</P>
<P>
   As racism accusations simmer, the moves that have sparked the
most discussion _ and dissension _ are the calls for a boycott.
</P>
<P>
   Shujia Zhou, who left Los Alamos last year, said, ``The Asian
people feel hit hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhou published research in journals like Science and Physical
Review Letters but said he had left the laboratory because
officials made continuing his work difficult, revoking his computer
access, for example, and because the atmosphere had soured for
Asians.
</P>
<P>
   He easily found another job. Browne, the Los Alamos director,
said that revoking computer privileges for some Asian scientists
was an ``unfortunate'' overreaction and that fairer procedures had
been put in place.
</P>
<P>
   The calls for a boycott have generated mixed reactions at the
laboratories. Manvendra K. Dubey, a Los Alamos scientist and
chairman of its Asian-American Working Group, said he opposed a
boycott ``because if we disappear from within, we will have no
voice.'' Some say the heightened sensitivity to race may eventually
help the laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, the security concerns about Asian countries, the
lack of data on where and how Asian-American scientists work and
the near-absence of Asians in upper ranks are hindering progress at
the laboratories, many Asian-American scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more pernicious, they add, is the idea, prevalent among
some Americans of European descent, that rational scientists must
be immune to ordinary racial bias. That visceral difference in
viewpoint may pose the most elusive but enduring barrier to
improvements, some Asian scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's hard for a white person to appreciate the bias,''
said Huan Lee, a Chinese-American scientist at Los Alamos.

CLINTON'S HELP IS BEING SOUGHT IN FALL ELECTION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Mo., N.J., Ore., Ill., Mich, Pa., Wis., Mich. )  By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At a time when polls show Vice President Al Gore
trailing his Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, in
several battleground states, an increasing number of Democrats
contend President Clinton should play a prominent role stumping for
Gore this fall _ even if it reminds voters that he, and not his
protege, remains the party's pre-eminent performer.
</P>
<P>
   In closely contested states from Washington to Missouri to New
Jersey, state Democratic leaders and strategists say Clinton could
bring much-needed charisma and excitement to a campaign that has
often seemed leaden and uninspiring, even to many of its allies.
</P>
<P>
   More important, those Democratic leaders say, Clinton is still
revered by important Democratic constituencies, particularly black
voters. Several recent polls suggest that a substantial number of
those core Democrats seem either disengaged from the contest or
disenchanted with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than having Clinton fade into the sunset after the
national convention, a la Ronald Reagan in 1988 or Dwight D.
Eisenhower in 1960, these Democrats want the president to play a
lead role in the party's vital get-out-the-vote efforts leading to
Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bill Clinton could carry this state for Al Gore,''
said Jim Edmunson, the chairman of the Oregon Democratic Party, a
traditionally strong Democratic state where a recent poll shows
Gore trailing Bush. ``My counsel would be to use the president
wherever and as often as they can.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's role in the post-convention campaign is the subject of
discussions between White House officials and aides to Gore,
including William Daley, the campaign chairman. Both sides say
Clinton has made it clear that he will bow to Gore's judgment on
how he should be involved, a decision the vice president is not
expected to make until after the convention.
</P>
<P>
   But the pressure to use Clinton has placed the Gore campaign in
a bind. The vice president's advisers acknowledge that Clinton's
artful touch with a crowd could energize Democratic voters for
Gore. But they worry that the president will outshine Gore on the
trail, making the nominee seem more like the campaign's understudy
than its star.
</P>
<P>
   For that very reason, the Democrats have scheduled Clinton to
address the Democratic National Convention on its first evening
next month, thereby leaving the spotlight to Gore for the next
three nights. Most Democrats view the convention as the moment when
Gore must step decisively out of Clinton's shadow and stake his
claim as the party's undisputed chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of Gore's real deficits, in terms of public image, is the
leadership question,'' said an informal adviser to the Gore
campaign. ``Curing that is more important than using Clinton's
magic with the base. The question is, would Clinton's efforts in
the fall undermine Gore's leadership image. It's a delicate
question that can't be answered yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Already an array of assignments for the first campaigner are
being kicked around. Which one the Gore camp selects will depend
largely on whether it believes the vice president has sufficiently
separated himself from Clinton immediately after the August
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Those assignments run the gamut. There is the minimal: Having
Clinton address only targeted, core Democratic groups, like
abortion rights advocates or black voters. And then there is the
expansive: Having him crisscross the most closely contested states
where he remains most popular, including Illinois, Michigan,
Pennsylvania, Missouri and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   While the Gore campaign clearly wants to keep its options open
for Clinton, Democratic leaders in many of those battleground
states have not been shy about voicing their opinions to the Gore
campaign and to Clinton himself: They would like to see the
president campaigning early and often on their home turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no one like the president who can communicate to
voters,'' said Paul Berendt, chairman of the Washington State
Democratic Party. ``I think he's the secret weapon of the Gore
effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Terri Spring, chairwoman of the Wisconsin Democratic Party,
said: ``I would welcome him to Wisconsin. He has done wonderful
things for the country. No American can deny that America is better
off now than eight years ago. And it's because of President
Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas P. Giblin, chairman of the New Jersey Democratic Party,
said Clinton remains popular in that state, where several polls
have shown the race very close. Though he acknowledged that using
Clinton extensively ``might be viewed as a dicey move,'' he argued
that the president's popularity with core Democrats and even some
independents would outweigh any risks he might pose.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might be the person it takes to activate people,'' Giblin
said. ``They seem to respond better to Bill Clinton than to Al
Gore.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Giblin's remarks underscore a concern usually expressed
privately by Democrats: That Gore is not connecting emotionally
with Democrats as well as Bush is with Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Several recent polls seem to confirm that worry. A Gallup survey
in late June showed 75 percent of Democrats supporting Gore,
compared with 91 percent of Republicans saying they would vote for
Bush. And a poll released on Thursday by the Pew Research Center
for the People and the Press shows that Republican support for Bush
is more intense than Democratic support for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats discount such early polls, arguing that their core
voters historically get interested in campaigns later than
Republicans. Once those Democrats and Democratic-leaning
independents become focused on the contest, they will quickly unite
behind the vice president, Gore's allies assert.
</P>
<P>
   But many of those same Democrats also say that Gore has suffered
from the widespread perception, fair or not, that he is not
particularly warm, engaging or likable.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Bill Clinton, I think anyone would seem to face a
letdown in terms of enthusiasm,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y.
``Clinton has been electric among the minority community. Gore,
unless he is turned on, can be stiff and awkward.''
</P>
<P>
   Though warm-and-fuzzy biographical commercials for Gore and a
feel-good Democratic convention could help him in the personality
contest, many Democrats say they are also counting on Clinton to
transfer some of his popularity to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can use his charm to get people to listen,'' said Roy
Temple, executive director of the Democratic Party in Missouri,
where a recent poll shows Bush leading Gore. And when he gets them
to listen, he can say: ``Who do you want to lead the country?
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore doesn't have to have Bill Clinton campaigning to
win,'' he added. ``But if you've got a resource like that, you use
it to the fullest extent possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if they were worried that Clinton would overshadow Gore on
the stump, most of the Democratic leaders said no. Voters, they
argued, would learn to accept the vice president for who he is once
they focus on the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charisma doesn't necessarily carry the day,'' said Spring, the
Wisconsin party chairwoman. ``Charisma may have gotten President
Clinton into some problems. The American people will be looking at
who can do the job. It's not who you want as your fishing buddy,
but who is competent.''
</P>
<P>
   But some Democrats argue that Clinton will bring too much
troublesome baggage to the campaign. They assert, for example, that
liberal Democrats who are disenchanted with administration policies
on health care, the environment and trade, and consequently leaning
toward Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate, are unlikely to
change their minds because of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Clinton helps among the traditional liberals,''
said Amy Isaacs, national director of Americans for Democratic
Action, a liberal group that has endorsed Gore.
</P>
<P>
   And some political analysts contend that Clinton could provide a
constant reminder of impeachment, Monica Lewinsky and campaign
finance abuses that could drive conservative Democrats and
independent voters into the arms of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``My belief is they've always wanted to punish Bill Clinton
somehow, and they are going to do that by punishing Al Gore,'' said
Ed Sarpolus, a Michigan-based pollster whose most recent survey
shows Bush with a 12-point lead in Michigan. ``Until Gore separates
himself, he'll be in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic leaders say they are less worried about those issues
than about Clinton's irrepressible fondness for the campaign,
which, they say, could make him difficult to control. Once
unleashed, will he follow the Gore script? Will he be willing to
sing in the chorus and not interrupt the vice president's solos?
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a racehorse and when the elections roll around, he's
eager to get out on the track,'' said David Axelrod, a Democratic
strategist who talks to both the White House and the Gore campaign.
``But it will be Gore's call. I think Clinton wants to do what is
best.''

<P>
   NEVADA CITY, Calif. _ The regulars at Moore's Cafe are holding
court at the counter, nursing refills of coffee. Cars amble down
Broad Street beside the horse-drawn carriages. Tourists browse the
pottery and jewelry stores. Hunch-shouldered teen-aged boys stand
on random corners, looking a little bored.
</P>
<P>
   These are the good old days, fading fast. Change is in the air
in this Gold Rush-era town (population: 2,900) 150 miles northeast
of San Francisco. Rush hour on Broad Street has become a bear.
Housing prices have jumped higher in a year than almost anywhere
else in California. McMansions are springing up near old hippie
cabins in the woods. Next door in Grass Valley, a Starbucks has
opened in the historic district.
</P>
<P>
   The old Gold Rush has met the new Gold Rush, and they are not
exactly hitting it off. The high-tekkies have arrived here with a
splash, jolting the pretty country towns along the Sierra Nevada
foothills like ice-water in the face. ``Some people just don't get
it,'' said Mayor Kerry Arnett of Nevada City, who runs a video
store. ``They choose to come here because of the unique ambience,
then they start asking for a 7-Eleven.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gold Rush towns, 200 miles from San Jose and the center of
the dot-com universe, are witnessing firsthand the infinite reach
of the new technology. Companies and individuals are branching away
from the congested, hyper-expensive burgs of Silicon Valley in
recent years, inexorably altering life in towns that have worn the
label ``sleepy'' with pride and joy. The Route 101 corridor of
Sonoma County, wine and farm country two hours north of Silicon
Valley, is now known as ``Telecom Alley.'' Technology has surpassed
grape growing as the No. 1 industry.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas, an old working-class farm town an hour's drive south of
Silicon Valley, is growing at twice the statewide pace, with 20
percent of new home buyers moving in from Silicon Valley. Near
Salinas, Gilroy, the self-proclaimed ``garlic capital of the
world,'' has become a prime bedroom community for high-tech
commuters from San Jose, 35 miles (but an hour in traffic) away.
</P>
<P>
   Some change is welcome. Real estate brokers, of course, are
giddy. And the tax bases are expanding faster than the towns can
estimate. But along with the new wealth comes a new fear among
longtime residents that their bucolic landscape and easy pace will
be eaten alive by development and traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one of our census tracts,'' said Mayor Anna Caballero of
Salinas, ``we have the density of Manhattan.''
</P>
<P>
   Limiting growth has become the No. 1 issue in towns through
northern and central California experiencing an influx of Silicon
Valley refugees. And as locals tell it, getting along with new
people who usually have more money and bigger cars and more demands
is a close second.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime residents say it was probably inevitable that Nevada
County would be discovered by dot-com escapees. Long a mecca for
small electronics manufacturers, the county is now home to 66
high-tech companies, says its Economic Resource Council, and real
estate brokers say at least 30 percent of new home buyers are
high-tech employees or telecommuters.
</P>
<P>
   As home not only to picturesque Nevada City but also the wild
and scenic Yuba River, an eye feast of falls and swimming holes
that evoke both Mark Twain and Club Med, this is a place where
people aspire to live. A generation ago, the county began seeing a
flood of artists and writers and hippies, who were eyed
suspiciously by the loggers and working folks until the newcomers
proved their mettle as good citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Bridwell, who restores antique cars, moved to the woods in
the San Juan Ridge, just outside of Nevada City, and was one of
those newcomers when he moved here 20 years ago. At the time, he
said, he was looking around the state for a place where he and his
wife could raise their 4-year-old daughter, Skye, and live in
peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew as soon as we saw it that this was the place,'' said
Bridwell, now 60. He and his wife built a solar-heated cabin which
is nearly halfway ensconced in earth. After the couple divorced,
Bridwell remained in the house. He likes to say he lives
underground, though a wall of windows offers an up-close view of
deer, owls, foxes and raccoons.
</P>
<P>
   He sees some advantages to the arrival of big companies like
3Com Corp., the computer modem manufacturer. ``But you get the
traffic and the development and you wonder when will it end?''
</P>
<P>
   Sonoma County is hoping it has that answer. The single most
momentous change in the county in recent times occurred when Cisco
Systems of San Jose plunked down $7.3 billion in 1999 to buy the
Cerent Corp. in the Victorian town of Petaluma. The largest
high-tech buyout of the year meant pay dirt for the employees of
Cerent, then a struggling start-up with technology to speed up the
Internet. Employees split a jackpot of $2.2 billion and began
building huge houses and starting up companies in the county.
</P>
<P>
   The wave of telecommunications companies attracted to the county
by Cisco's investment (the company also bought Fibex Systems in
Petaluma in 1999 for $320 million) has reached a critical mass _ at
least two dozen companies have moved in over the last two years,
much to the dismay of many residents.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Sonoma County still boasts the rolling hills and green
landscape that attracts the city slickers and soothes the locals'
souls. But corporate architecture and the oversized houses are
springing up faster than the eye can process.
</P>
<P>
   This month, a coalition of conservation-minded groups won the
right to place a measure limiting growth on the November ballot.
The measure, called the rural growth initiative, would require that
any changes for the next 30 years to the county's general plan on
rural and agricultural lands be approved by a countywide vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are sick of standing by and watching greenbelts and
open space paved over,'' said AnnaLis Dalrymple, a member of the
Greenbelt Alliance, which helped draft the initiative, at a hearing
where the county board voted to place the initiative on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   In Salinas, which for so long has been described as
``struggling'' that the word seems part of its name, big home
developments, new malls and chain stores are replacing farms and
open land at such a pace that it is beginning to look like a
suburb.
</P>
<P>
   For the Chamber of Commerce, the news is all good. But the
low-wage workers, many of them immigrants who have counted on one
day buying a home here are frustrated by the prices and the
seemingly easy money of their new neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Gonzalez Jr., a 31-year-old father of four who works on a
vegetable farm, says he drives out of the way to avoid the shiny
new white houses along the highway. That way, he said, his children
don't ask why they can't live there, and ``I avoid the envy for
gaudy material things.''

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ David Trimble, the leader of Northern Ireland's new
power-sharing government, paid a brief visit here recently, shortly
before Ulster re-erupted into flames last week and Middle East
negotiators hunkered down for endgame peace talks in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   As one veteran peacemaker to another, he held a comradely chat
with Yossi Beilin, the Israeli justice minister who helped lay the
groundwork for the Camp David summit, and another with Oded Eran,
who ran Israel's preliminary negotiations with the Palestinians.
Earlier, in Gaza, he met with Yasser Arafat and other senior
Palestinian officials.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli reporter buttonholed him and asked him to contrast
the parties in conflict here with the two sides of the Ulster
dispute. Trimble refused. ``There is no room for comparison,'' he
said flatly. ``The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is much more
complex than ours.''
</P>
<P>
   The disappointed Israeli pressed on: Isn't the Irish problem far
more entrenched, with enmities dating back 500 or 600 years?
</P>
<P>
   Trimble wasn't buying it. The present Irish troubles began
barely three decades ago, he replied, while ``your conflict is
3,000 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. From Ulster or from here, peace seekers tend to see the
other conflict as one inherited from the past, and their own as one
based in the more manageable present.
</P>
<P>
   Returning home, Trimble was quickly pulled into the peculiar
dynamics of the Ulster ``marching season,'' which celebrates the
defeat of the Catholic King James II by the Protestant King William
III 310 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians and Israelis, meanwhile, were ensconced in the
Catoctin hills, confronting seemingly intractable issues _
refugees, borders, the ownership of Jerusalem _ which are rooted
not in ancient history but in Israel's victory over Arab forces
here just half a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh wounds, however, are the most painful, noted Meron
Benvenisti, one of Israel's leading social commentators. ``The
conflict here is much more raw, and even among intellectuals there
is less understanding of the other side's position and history than
you would find in Northern Ireland,'' said Benvenisti, who wrote
his Harvard doctoral thesis on Ulster politics 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most Israelis who have compared the conflicts, Benvenisti
agrees with Trimble that the dispute between Israelis and Arabs _
whatever its timeline _ is inherently more difficult. The religious
and ethnic division and distrust is more profound, the economic and
political disparities are far greater, and at the explosive heart
of the conflict are mutually exclusive territorial claims, he
notes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all those reasons, he and others here say, Israelis and
Palestinians should look at Northern Ireland for instructive
parallels, warning signs and, more recently, practical lessons in
how to resolve conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the lessons are encouraging. The riots that raged
through Northern Ireland last week could be seen as a foreshadowing
of the internal problems many expect Israel and the Palestinians
will confront after a settlement. With the staunchly loyalist Royal
Ulster Constabulary faced off against Orange Order marchers, the
parades that had long been a flashpoint for friction with Catholics
instead exposed deep rifts within the Protestant community.
Similarly, Israeli troops are braced to confront militant Jewish
settlers, while Palestinian police are prepared to battle radical
Islamist opponents of a peace pact.
</P>
<P>
   The bloody terrorist bombings by breakaway Irish Republican
factions after the Good Friday agreement was reached in 1988 offer
another object lesson for the future here, some observers believe.
And the fierce resistance within the Irish Republican Army to
unequivocal disarmament is likely to have its parallels in the
Fatah movement and other armed Palestinian factions after an
accord, Beilin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the two longest-running conflicts since the Second
World War,'' said Beilin, who visited Belfast in January. ``In both
cases we now seem close to a solution, but in Northern Ireland this
week we saw the fragility of the process. Good Friday can be
followed by Bad Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   In April, Beilin convened a workshop here where Israeli and
Palestinian officials traded insights with Irish and British
experts in the Ulster conflict. What struck him most forcefully, he
said, is the need for peace agreements to reflect the power of
``symbols and rituals,'' along with more tangible things like
political institutions and economic benefits. An example: Beilin
believes Israel should let a Palestinian flag fly over the Dome of
the Rock, the crowning monument of Jerusalem's Old City _ an image
shocking to many Israelis, but to Palestinians a powerful statement
of their national identity.
</P>
<P>
   Beilin particularly admires the artful blurring of sovereignty
lines in the Good Friday accord. The Republic of Ireland now has a
formal consultative role in the Northern Irish government, a
concession that for many Protestant loyalists struck at the core of
their British identity. Yet in return the Republic withdrew its
historic claim on the province and formally recognized the United
Kingdom's rule there for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has also repeatedly drawn comparisons. In
speeches in Northern Ireland he pointed to the Oslo accord as a
sign of the possibility of cooperation between once-bitter enemies,
and when visiting Israel and the Palestinian territories, he cited
the Good Friday accord as an example of what he hoped negotiators
could achieve in final-status talks here.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant parallel is the critical mediation of
Clinton himself, said David Scannell, a veteran Irish diplomat, who
worked on the Northern Ireland settlement before being sent to
Israel as Dublin's ambassador four years ago. But when looking at
the political backdrop to both negotiations, Scannell is
discouraged about Clinton's chances for securing a settlement here.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli polls still show a solid 40-percent-plus opposition to a
peace accord, he noted. In the referendum approving the Good Friday
pact, support was overwhelming in the Irish Republic _ it passed 94
percent to 6 percent _ and still resounding in the predominately
Protestant North, where it carried by 71 percent to 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Benvenisti is similarly pessimistic, saying that in the critical
``emotional aspects of the conflict,'' Israelis and Palestinians do
not appear ready for a lasting, binding compromise. Yet he adds
that the increasing normalization of life in Belfast, with its two
long-warring communities, may offer hope for a resolution of the
dispute over ethnically divided Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be said that if you know the solution to the Irish
question, you don't know the question,'' Benvenisti said. ``The
same could still be said here.''

FLORIDA AWARD CLOUDS FUTURE TOBACCO ACTION IN SUITS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Conn.)   By BARRY MEIER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For more than a week, a six-member person jury in a Miami
courtroom heard the song of the new cigarette industry.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, the chief executives of Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds
and other major tobacco companies appeared before the jury to tell
how they had turned over a new leaf. They had agreed to pay $246
billion to states to fight teen-age smoking and help pay for the
ills of injured smokers. Some executives told jurors of their
efforts to develop less dangerous cigarettes. And, they said, the
need to punish their companies with punitive damages was past.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami jury, when it reached its verdict on Friday, seemed to
respond as if it had not heard a word of the executives' testimony
or, perhaps worse, as if the industry's arguments had infuriated
the jurors more. After five hours of deliberations, they meted out
a stunning $144.8 billion punitive award to members of a
class-action lawsuit brought on behalf of all Florida residents
made sick by smoking.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the tobacco industry's arguments in the Miami
case could haunt it in future lawsuits or spur it toward an overall
settlement. But even if cigarette makers succeed in getting the
award sharply reduced or even thrown out, as many experts expect,
the staggering size of the damage figure stunned some legal experts
and sounded alarm bells.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am perfectly willing to believe that the industry has done
all the things that the jury believes it has done,'' said Peter
Schuck, a Yale Law School professor who has testified as an expert
witness for a cigarette maker. ``But as a constitutional matter
this is a terrible way to govern ourselves. To let six people
decide how society should punish a company as distinguished to
simply compensating plaintiffs.''
</P>
<P>
   But others said that the tobacco industry had only itself to
blame for the verdict, given its decadeslong fight against
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This jury's verdict is probably a reflection of frustration at
the failure of other branches of government to hold this industry
accountable,'' said Matthew Myers, the president of the Campaign
for Tobacco-Free Kids in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   A juror, Gary Chwast, 30, a postal worker, told The Miami Herald
on Friday, ``You can't just say you're sorry after 50 years.'' The
Herald quoted other jurors as saying they wanted to ``send a strong
message based on the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts had another explanation: That a panel of six tired
people, who heard the case over two years, wanted to go home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury had his case for a really long time,'' said Clark
Freshman, an associate professor at the University of Miami Law
School. ``I suspect they had figured out that the punitive damages
could be reduced on appeal and that's why they went with a high
amount.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Miami jury's award is likely to be hotly debated by legal
experts and others for months. But in many ways, its size also
reflected the unique nature of the Florida case and how it
proceeded.
</P>
<P>
   For one, a class-action case against the cigarette industry had
never previously gone to trial. And the jury heard the case in
segments. Last year, for example, it found that cigarette producers
had conspired to mislead the public about the dangers of smoking.
In April, based on that decision, it awarded a record $12.7 million
in compensatory damages, or those intended to cover medical costs
and pain, to three smokers chosen to represent the class.
</P>
<P>
   Those findings set the stage for the latest part of the trial in
which the jury was asked to decide punitive damages, or those
intended to punish a company for its conduct, on behalf of the
entire class, a group estimated at 300,000 to 700,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The potential for a huge damage award had not been lost on the
cigarette makers. In May, they succeeded in getting a bill passed
by the Florida Legislature limiting to $100 million the amount of
money that a defendant had to post to appeal a verdict in a Florida
state case. Previously, defendants had to post the entire amount of
an award.
</P>
<P>
   The companies, along with state officials, had argued that
posting a bond to cover huge punitive damages in the case could
both bankrupt cigarette makers and jeopardize the $246 billion in
payments they are paying states as a result of lawsuit settlements
with the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the potential for immediate financial disaster
apparently averted, the stakes were still high as the punitive
damages phase of the trial unfolded. And as it did, tobacco
producers rolled out an argument against punitive damages that they
had been refining over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, it was that the industry had repented. Not only is
it paying the states billions, it no longer sends its top
executives to Congress to argue that smoking is not addictive and
does not cause cancer. It is open. It is honest. It is different.
The message did not play with the jurors.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman of the University of Miami said that he believed that
cigarette producers might have undercut themselves when they
testified they could not afford to pay substantial damages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the tobacco companies blew it when they argued
they had no money to pay for punitive damages,'' Freshman said.
``That probably made the jury disregard all their arguments.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Robert Rabin, a law professor at Stanford University, said he
believed the Miami jury turned a deaf ear to the industry, a sign
that could spell trouble for the industry as it faces punitive
damages in other cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``They shifted course and it didn't help them,'' Rabin said.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco industry lawyers like Gregory Little, associate general
counsel for Philip Morris, said they believed the structure of the
trial was so unfair and the jury's verdict so absurd that the
entire case will be thrown out on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   And while other class-action lawsuits are looming, Little said
he believed that they would never get to trial because class-action
lawsuits are a flawed legal vehicle for resolving smokers' claims.
</P>
<P>
   Others said that the Miami case would encourage more lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, anti-smoking advocates offered differing views.
While some expressed concern that the cigarette industry could use
the size of the award to cast itself in the role of legal whipping
boy, others, like Dr. David Kessler, the former head of the Federal
Food and Drug Administration, saw it differently
</P>
<P>
   Kessler, now the dean of Yale Medical School, said that no
matter what spin the industry or anti-smoking advocates put on the
award, the message of the jury was clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury award is less important for the money or whether any
group of smokers will see any of the damages,'' Kessler said,
``than it is for the future of the industry.''

<P>
   SOMMOCOLONIA, Italy _ Albert O. Burke, 80, silently strolled
around the ruins of a medieval fortress in the village where dozens
of black servicemen were killed on Dec. 26, 1944, and broke down.
``I felt I owed it to the fellows to come back,'' he sobbed as two
other frail veterans held him up. ``But I don't think I want to
come back here anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The place that stirred him so deeply was Sommocolonia, a
poignant footnote in both World War II military history and the
uncompleted story of America's black war veterans. Among Burke's
comrades killed here was a lieutenant named John Fox, who died
shortly after ordering his own men to fire on his position because
it was about to be overrun by advancing Austrian and German
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   A hero of the black 92nd Infantry Division in a segregated U.S.
military, Fox was awarded a Medal of Honor by Congress only in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Burke, Otis Zachary, 83, and Richard O. Hogg, 80, toured
Sommocolonia on Friday, their first visit to the battle zone in
almost 56 years, seeking to close the most vivid chapter of their
lives. And the anguish they relived was echoed among the Italian
war survivors who welcomed their return.
</P>
<P>
   The black veterans and their Italian hosts have more than war
memories in common.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Burke and his comrades and relatives cannot shed their
bitterness over the United States' long refusal to fully recognize
the combat records of black servicemen, many Italian veterans
cannot forgive their own countrymen who fought against them more
than 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sommocolonia, a dying mountain village of fewer than 50
inhabitants that overlooks Barga in Tuscany, wants to forge out of
its ruins some sort of peace memorial to honor Fox and all those
who died: black soldiers, village civilians, Italian partisans, and
Italian and German troops. But that still hazy plan has resurrected
old rancors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peace is always won through liberation from oppression, and
you cannot put together oppressors and liberators,'' said Moreno
Salvatori, 67, who withdrew from the ``Fortress of Peace''
committee in protest. His father was taken prisoner by the Germans
during the war and died in captivity. ``It's a mixing of memories
that I cannot share.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the only thing that everyone agrees on is that Fox is a
hero all sides must hurry to honor here before those few left who
remember his heroism die themselves.
</P>
<P>
   It was that sense of urgency that led Solace Wales, an American
writer who has commuted between Marin County, Calif., and
Sommocolonia since 1972, to invite ``Buffalo Soldiers,'' the name
first given to black servicemen in the 1860s, back to Sommocolonia
for a memorial ceremony on Sunday, even before the town had agreed
on what kind of monument to build.
</P>
<P>
   Wales, who began 20 years ago to research the history of Fox and
the other black soldiers who fought around Sommocolonia, is a
little like Frances Mayes, author of ``Under the Tuscan Sun,'' only
in addition to fixing up her 16th-century villa and garden, Wales
wanted to restore Sommocolonia's place in history. ``Somebody had
to tell the story,'' she said. ``It had been in the shadows too
long.''
</P>
<P>
   Unrooting the story of Fox and his comrades was not difficult
here, where survivors warmly recall the black soldiers. They were
part of the Allied forces seeking to keep Axis troops behind the
so-called Gothic Line, which in 1944 stretched from the Ligurian
Sea to the Adriatic.
</P>
<P>
   On the Piazza Martiri della Resistenza, a memorial in a wooded
park at the top of Sommocolonia, seven stone slabs commemorate
slain Italian resistance fighters. Next to them another memorial
reads, in Italian, ``John Fox. Lt. American Army. 26.12.44'' It was
erected in 1979, three years before the U.S. Army, under pressure
from black veterans associations, awarded Fox the Distinguished
Service Cross.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were wonderful, so nice to us,'' said Irma Biondi, now
77. ``My little brothers followed them like shadows.''
</P>
<P>
   Remembering the chicken, rabbits, chocolate and cheese that the
more than 60 black servicemen stationed here gave out on Christmas
Day, 1944, she said: ``We had never seen so much food,''.
</P>
<P>
   Biondi also vividly recalled the sound of the stomping boots of
Austrian soldiers under German command who stormed the town that
night. ``We fled out into the streets, passing over the bodies of
dead Americans and Germans.''
</P>
<P>
   At least seven civilians died that day. German war records show
that 43 members of the Austrian 4th Mountain Division died in the
fighting. U.S. Army records are more spotty, but historians say
about 40 black American soldiers died here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have fellows who should be recognized now,'' said
Burke, president of the 92nd Infantry Division World War II
Association, a Buffalo Soldiers veterans association.
</P>
<P>
   Reminiscing earlier at their hotel in Barga, the three men joked
as they recalled petty injustices inflicted by their senior
officers, who were white. But when Zachary, still cocky at 83,
reached the tower, he too was overcome. After trying to console
Burke, he collapsed himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Burke,'' he keened, ``I see him in the tower, I see John.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's widow, Arlene Fox, accompanied by her sister-in-law, her
daughter and two grandchildren, arrived on Thursday to stay with
Wales in Sommocolonia. But Mrs. Fox did not accompany her husband's
three comrades on their first tour of the crumbling fortress at the
top of the hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of unresolved feelings about being here,'' she
explained. ``It's so beautiful, and people have been so kind, and
that helps. But it is not easy.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That was what Antonio Nardini, 79, said, only he was talking
about dealing with his own experience as a soldier in Mussolini's
army. Nardini, who volunteered in 1939, was taken prisoner by
Italian partisans in 1945, and said he was rescued from execution
by American army officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before 1943, Italy had 40 million Fascists,'' he said, citing
the year Mussolini was overthrown and Italy switched sides in the
war. ``Afterward,'' he said sarcastically, ``there were 40 million
anti-Fascists. Except one: me.''
</P>
<P>
   Several former partisans said that it was time to get over
wartime enmities and to honor all the dead, including the Fascists
and Germans. Nardini, who is president of the Barga chapter of the
Lucca Historical Society, agreed. He, like most other former
Fascists, mourns his fallen comrades in private ceremonies quietly
organized by fellow veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of demagoguery about the resistance,'' he said.
``But there is no debate about Fox.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His gesture may have been futile,'' he said, noting that the
Germans took the town anyway. ``But he acted like a real soldier.''
</P>
<P>
   In Sommocolonia, which even at the height of the war had more
than 200 inhabitants, the desire for a monument is not just about
Fox, or even about the war. It is about surviving postwar
demographic shifts that have turned a once vibrant village into an
almost deserted retirement home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need something alive, for the town, not a museum for the
dead,'' said Dario Giannini, who is coordinating the weekend
activities. ``The bombs didn't just destroy the fortress, they
killed the hope of the entire village.''

IN CANADA, ABORTION WAR GROWS VIOLENT
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   YELLOWKNIFE, Northwest Territories _ Canada, traditionally North
America's liberal bastion in the abortion war, is suddenly gripped
by a polarizing debate that has gone beyond ideology to an array of
violent attacks and threats.
</P>
<P>
   In the space of one week, a right-wing politician with strong
anti-abortion views was elected leader of Canada's main opposition
party, a Vancouver gynecologist who performs abortions was stabbed
in the back and a death threat was telephoned to the leader of
national trials of an abortion drug. A man claiming to represent
the ``Baby Liberation Army'' called a newspaper to claim the
stabbing and to warn other abortion doctors to ``watch their
backs.''
</P>
<P>
   Only days earlier, Dr. Ellen Wiebe, the physician who leads the
clinical trials of the French morning-after pill RU-486, was seen
on national television, discussing tests of the drug that started
recently on women in Vancouver and three other cities.
</P>
<P>
   Now, she has retreated behind a police guard, refusing all
interviews. Her earlier television appearances prompted one
anti-abortion group to criticize RU-486 strongly.
</P>
<P>
   Police say her public statements may also have spurred an
anti-abortion activist to attack Dr. Garson Romalis as he entered
his Vancouver clinic. The assailant, believed to be in his 20s,
escaped.
</P>
<P>
   Romalis, whose gynecological procedures include late-term
abortions for women whose fetuses show signs of severe birth
defects, was attacked once before, by a sniper outside his house in
1994. After that shooting, two other Canadian doctors who perform
abortions were shot and wounded. The suspect in all three cases, an
American anti-abortion activist named James Charles Kopp, is on the
FBI's 10 Most Wanted List for the 1998 killing of a Buffalo, N.Y.,
doctor, Barnett Slepian.
</P>
<P>
   Two violent attacks on the same doctor is ``unprecedented,''
said Vicki Sapporta, executive director of the National Abortion
Federation, which includes 350 abortion clinics in North America.
Romalis is in stable condition and under police guard in a
Vancouver hospital. In ``Nuremburg Files,'' an American
anti-abortion Web site that lists North American doctors who
perform abortions, the Romalis' name and those of several other
doctors appear in gray, a code for ``wounded.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Henry Morgentaler, a gynecologist whose insistence on
performing abortions led Canada's Supreme Court to legalize
abortion fully in 1988, said last week that this violence had had a
chilling effect on doctors. In Canada, abortion is not available in
Prince Edward Island and access has been reduced in five provinces.
Recently, he said, two doctors in Guelph, Ontario, a university
city, stopped performing abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, about 115,000 abortions were performed in Canada. One
conservative commentator, Ted Byfield, wrote last month that
Canada's Liberal government, instead of promoting the immigration
of 200,000 people a year, should rejuvenate Canada's aging
population by encouraging women to bring unwanted pregnancies to
term and to place the babies up for adoption.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, anti-abortion forces won a political boost when the
Canadian Alliance, the nation's largest opposition party, chose as
its leader Stockwell Day, a former evangelical youth pastor. Day,
who most recently was Alberta's provincial treasurer, has played
down the abortion issue lately, suggesting it could be decided in
an unusual national referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Some abortion-rights activists charge that Day's rise has given
a green light to the violent fringe of Canada's anti-abortion
movement.
</P>
<P>
   After the stabbing of Romalis, Day condemned the use of
violence, saying: ``I've been very clear, very clear on this. How
would you like me to spell it out? Denounce, condemn, outrageous,
untenable.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics were unmoved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have Stockwell Day, an evangelical minister, a very
religious-right person, signing up members from the anti-choice
movement in Canada and spouting anti-choice, anti-abortion
rhetoric,'' Marilyn Wilson, president of the Canadian Abortion
Rights Action League, said from her office in Ottawa. ``Also, he
has to take some responsibility for people taking action who share
his beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   Day's campaign manager, Jason Kenney, a member of Parliament for
the Alliance, called the accusations ``really outrageous.''

MONEY FROM EXPATRIATE SRI LANKAN TAMILS IN CANADA FLOWS TO ISLAND
REBELLION 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Map is being sent to NYT graphic clients. Nonsubscribers

<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ At Queens Park, a swath of green in front of the
legislative building downtown, thousands gathered one recent
Saturday for a festive celebration. A band played. Children danced.
Volunteers bearing cardboard piggy banks trolled the crowd for
donations. Wads of cash were enthusiastically stuffed inside.
</P>
<P>
   But these were no ordinary festivities. The revelers had come to
celebrate the latest ``victory'' of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam, the guerrillas embroiled in one of the world's bloodiest
secessionist wars in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
   A colossal effigy of the cherub-faced guerrilla leader,
Vellupillai Prabhakaran, stood on the stage. Videos of the rebels'
latest exploits were on sale. And, of greatest concern to the Sri
Lankan government, the donations collected here by Canadian Tamils,
it is believed, would ultimately find their way to support the
Tamil insurrection.
</P>
<P>
   Fund raising for the Tigers is illegal in the United States, but
Canada has no such prohibition. Canadian intelligence officials and
Sri Lankan diplomats say it has become an increasingly important
source of support for the Tigers, who are seeking to carve a Tamil
homeland out of Sri Lanka, an island nation off the southern tip of
India.
</P>
<P>
   Since it began in 1983, 62,000 have died in the war and
displaced 1 million people, including about 150,000 Tamil refugees
who have poured into this city, making it home to the largest
concentration of Sri Lankan Tamils outside Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
   So, oceans away from the mass graves and suicide bombers that
have become hallmarks of the civil war, the Tamils of Toronto hold
pledge drives on Tamil radio, fill tills on shop counters, and
solicit money door-to-door in Tamil neighborhoods and workplaces.
Experts estimate they send from $7 million to $22 million a year in
direct and indirect support for the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Among the many seemingly improbable champions of the guerrilla
cause is Sitta Sittampalam, 66, a former schoolteacher with a patch
of silver hair and a gold pen tucked smartly in his breast pocket.
</P>
<P>
   What much of the world might consider terrorism, Sittampalam
calls a liberation struggle for Sri Lanka's Tamil minority, which
he says has suffered years of repression by the island's majority
Sinhalese.
</P>
<P>
   If that struggle results in ``incidental'' civilian deaths, said
Sittampalam, who now heads a Tamil immigrant aid agency here, it is
part of the regrettable but inevitable logic of war. He regards the
Tigers' suicide bombers, known for blowing up politicians and
civilians alike, to be ``heroes'' of the highest order; indeed, the
Black Tigers, as they are called, are commemorated here every July.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do all that I can to support Prabhakaran, to see that this
struggle matures to the stage where we have one free nation
recognized in the international community,'' said Sittampalam, who
like many overseas Tamils became politically active long after
leaving Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
   Like other Tiger supporters, he insists his money goes toward a
charity that provides humanitarian aid, though that too, relief
workers say, is controlled by the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the efforts of the Jewish diaspora that made Israel a
free country,'' Sittampalam said. ``Why shouldn't Tamils do that?''
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by the potent idea of a homeland, Tamils overseas have
been vital to drumming up political and financial support for the
separatist cause _ much like Jewish, Arab and Irish expatriates
have for their own struggles. And while the Tigers certainly have
other lucrative means of support, many scholars and Sri Lankan
diplomats say the scope of the insurgency could not be sustained
without expatriate aid.
</P>
<P>
   Tamil nationalist fervor was on full display a few weeks ago,
after the Tigers captured the strategic gateway to the northern
Jaffna peninsula, a part of Sri Lanka that the Tamils would like to
see as their own.
</P>
<P>
   One Tamil radio station, announcing its pledges over the
airwaves like a public radio fund-raising drive, took in more than
$600,000, said Nehru Gunaratnam, a spokesman for the World Tamil
Movement, the group that sponsored the rally in June and is
effectively the political arm of the Tigers in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, pro-Tiger activists went door-to-door, coaxing
regular donors to make special offerings. They appeared at the home
of one such donor, who requested anonymity for fear of both
Canadian law enforcement and World Tamil Movement organizers. He
chatted with the solicitors over a cup of tea. They filled him in
on the news from home, and left with $250. That was in addition to
his regular $100 monthly contribution, deducted directly from his
checking account.
</P>
<P>
   No, he chuckled, he does not claim it on his tax returns. And
no, he does not ask how the money is spent. He would feel guilty
asking, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here, having a good job, eating well, having a car,
going for parties,'' explained the man, who came here after a mob
chased his family out of their home in Colombo, the capital of Sri
Lanka, in 1983. ``When we are living like this and giving a little
money, to ask questions, it's not correct.''
</P>
<P>
   Such voluntary contributions make up the bulk of the money
raised for the Tigers, law enforcement authorities and Tamil
Canadians say. But sometimes, they say, a bit of polite coercion is
used, and occasionally Tamil gang members are deployed against
Tiger critics.
</P>
<P>
   The police say proceeds from immigrant smuggling and heroin
trafficking may also make their way into the Tiger treasury. In
recent years, dozens of Tamil street-gang members have been
convicted on immigration and drug charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them, we believe may be giving money to the Tigers,''
said Sgt. Fred Bowen of the drug section of the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police. ``Because it's not a criminal offense, we don't
devote our resources there.''
</P>
<P>
   That may soon change. Canada does not keep a list of proscribed
terrorist groups, as the United States does, but it is a signatory
to a recent U.N. convention that urges countries to monitor and
ultimately freeze the collection or deposit of money that may be
used to buy arms for, or otherwise support, terrorists abroad.
Canadian lawmakers are currently considering how to amend their
criminal code to comply with the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Canada has also tried to deport known members of the
Tigers, notably Manikavasagam Suresh, the former spokesman for the
Federation of Associations of Canadian Tamils, an umbrella group
that includes the World Tamil Movement, arguing that he posed a
risk to national safety. The case of Suresh, a key fund-raiser, is
being appealed before Canada's Supreme Court.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the charity the World Tamil Movement says receives
much of its money, the Tamil Rehabilitation Organization, is itself
controlled by the Tigers, according to officials with several
independent nongovernmental organizations in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my mind, and to most people here, they are basically the
development wing of the LTTE,'' said Simon Harris, acting country
director for poverty aid agency Oxfam in Sri Lanka, using the
Tigers' initials.
</P>
<P>
   By law, Americans cannot contribute to any group linked to
organizations on the State Department's terrorist list, like the
Tigers. But those links are not always clear.
</P>
<P>
   Tamil-Americans can, and do, raise money for the Tamil
Rehabilitation Organization, which is not on the State Department's
list. The group has a fund-raiser scheduled for July 23 in Edison,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of how much money leaves Canada in support of the
Tamil cause vary widely. Peter Chalk, a researcher with the
Washington office of the Rand Institute, offers a ``very rough''
estimate of about $600,000 to $1 million each month.
</P>
<P>
   Rohan Gunaratna, a research associate at the Center for Study of
Terrorism and Political Violence at the University of St. Andrews
in Edinburgh, says Canadians raise up to $22 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Some of it trickles out, Gunaratna contends, through a web of
bank accounts that are used to procure arms. But much of it, he and
others say, is dispatched through an informal, paperless
money-lending system, through which money deposited at a Tamil shop
in Toronto can end up halfway around the world in a matter of
hours, leaving no record of the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, those who take up collections here, chiefly the
World Tamil Movement, cannot, or will not, explain how the money
they collect is transferred or spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are different avenues I can't talk about,'' Gunaratnam,
the group's spokesman, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Relief reaches there,'' he said simply. ``It is distributed.''

PHILADELPHIA HOPES TO BE STAR AND STAGE OF GOP MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Before its recent downtown revival and upbeat
remake as a major convention site, this city spent some years
indulging self-abnegation in its advertising. ``Philadelphia isn't
as bad as Philadelphians say it is,'' went the slogan, followed by
a variety of punch lines about overlooked local attractions.
</P>
<P>
   There is soon to be a great test in the form of the Republican
National Convention of whether this city is safely beyond such
gloomy habits. In two weeks, the first of 45,000 delegates,
political attendants and news media from around the world will
arrive to see for themselves whether the city's new renaissance
gleam might finally eclipse the old put-down by one native son, the
comedian W.C. Fields, who observed that, if nothing else,
Philadelphia offers preferable shelter to the grave.
</P>
<P>
   With the nomination of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas a foregone
conclusion and the four-day Republican agenda a predictable
exercise in free media exposure and party boosterism, one of the
few honest novelties to be discovered by the conventioneers will be
this city and the true extent of its proclaimed metamorphosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say brotherly love; it's more like push and
shove,'' said Jakai Bishop, a 20-year-old Philadelphian who prefers
not Fieldsian misanthropy but a hip-hop lilt in her celebration of
the spirit of hustle she now finds in her city. Bishop is laboring
with an army of other overtime workers to transform the First Union
Center from a high-tech sports arena to a first-class political
hall.
</P>
<P>
   Hammering and sawing the podium into place, workers report
everything on schedule for the show that begins on July 31. The
electrical workers in this fiercely pro-union Democratic city,
after a jurisdictional skirmish or two, are finally snaking miles
of fiber-optic cables into the sky boxes of the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Souvenir gift packages are being assembled, with each delegate
to receive a convention Barbie doll in red suit and red heels, just
as Democratic conventioneers will receive blue-suited Barbies in
August in Los Angeles. Contract laborers can be found scuttling at
midnight along moonlit sidewalks to hurriedly drill handsome green
bus kiosks into place for visitors who will be the city's first
national political conventioneers since 1948.
</P>
<P>
   The evening skyline is stridently patriotic with buildings
already aglow in added hues of red, white and blue. Newly trained
busboys, chambermaids and legions of other fresh recruits are
polishing up the 4,500 new hotel rooms furiously built in the last
four years in the city's gamble to become a top-tier convention
city.
</P>
<P>
   In sum, Philadelphia is exuding the anxious headiness of a
theater production in the final throes of rehearsing a command
performance for the nation. And, indeed and alas, a piece of rosy
civic scenery did come crashing to the stage this week in the form
of the televised snippet replayed round the world of some of the
Philadelphia Police Department's officers flailing away at a
fugitive suspect at the end of a bullet-punctuated street chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, they don't have conventions in Ames, Iowa, or other
places where there's no crime,'' said David L. Cohen, co-chairman
of the convention host committee. With this variation on the theme
that the show must go on, Cohen, a principal in the administration
of former Mayor Edward Rendell, which led the city's comeback,
served notice that Philadelphia resolves not to slide back to the
old self-abnegation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to see another example of Philadelphians'
maturity in this, their ability to deal with this incredibly
difficult and wonderful city,'' Cohen said, predicting that the
police incident would be investigated and the citizens would lose
neither faith nor face in the process.
</P>
<P>
   But out beyond the downtown towers where the power roosts, that
piece of television videotape is giving an entirely different sort
of hope to Cheri Honkala, director of the Kensington Welfare Rights
Union, a self-help neighborhood organization for the poor and
homeless. ``Those TV pictures finally offered a window on what poor
people here have to deal with on a daily basis,'' declared Honkala,
who said the videotape was prompting more calls from people
interested in joining the union's protest march on the opening day.
</P>
<P>
   Although a half-dozen protests in behalf of myriad causes are
being planned for the visiting Republicans, the Kensington group is
the one organization that has been denied a permit for its plan to
march 3 miles through the city's heart, from City Hall to the
convention hall. Honkala insists that her group nevertheless will
proceed. If so, clearly an early test of the city maturity
mentioned by Cohen will be at hand, with more than one television
news helicopter watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, people evolve,'' said Abdul-Rahman Salaam, a city
native who lives in the Overbrook section. ``There's social
progress. We get to see things with a clearer vision.'' As a black
man, he described the sense of pessimism, even despair, in years
past in his neighborhood when political candidates routinely
polarized the city _ a time summoned forth instantly for him by the
television tape. ``Some of those old ugly things creep back,''
Salaam said. ``But believe me, this city is better, absolutely,
positively, no question. I'd even say there's some spirit of
brotherhood,'' Salaam said with a tinge of amazement at what he had
just said about the city.
</P>
<P>
   This affection of Philadelphians for their city seems even more
at stake in the coming test than the concern for the city's new
hotel and convention ventures and the outsiders' confirmation of a
fresh image.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city's history always seems to include some event that
held each generation back, from the 1790s and the yellow fever
epidemic onward,'' said Kenneth Finkel, cultural director for WHYY,
one of the city's public radio stations. A respected chronicler of
city history and an unabashed Philadelphia lover, Finkel journeys
back and forth to his Mount Airy neighborhood each day, carefully
noting the masked-over graffiti and other touches of the
approaching rendezvous with the Republicans and with the watching
nation.
</P>
<P>
   The tape of the police beating must unavoidably join the city's
iconography, Finkel concedes. But, like the rest of this city, he
wonders what lies beyond that. Will Philadelphia show itself safely
beyond the old era of self-doubt? ``There's the sincerest hope that
we are,'' he said.

HAITI REFUSES TO BACK DOWN ON ELECTIONS
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti _ Haitian officials say they will stand by
the results of their recent elections despite threats from
international donors to suspend aid because of a vote-counting
method they deemed unfair and unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Asselin Charles, a spokesman for Prime Minister Jacques-Edouard
Alexis, said outside countries had misunderstood the counting
method and that the results could not be changed because elections
are the responsibility of the Provisional Electoral Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government feels that democracy is a question of
institutions, and the government cannot interfere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The impasse began after the first round of elections on May 21,
when the electoral council gave a near-total sweep to the
candidates of Fanmi Lavalas, the political party of former
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Electoral observers criticized
the council's tallying method, which, instead of requiring
candidates to win with an absolute majority, counted only the votes
received by the top four finishers in each race. The count thus
ignored many votes received by minor candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The disputed count gave Lavalas 18 of the 19 Senate seats in the
first round. Leon Manus, the president of the electoral council,
resigned after the first round and fled the country, fearing for
his life after accusing the government of pressuring him to approve
questionable results. When the Haitian government refused to
recalculate the first-round results, the Organization of American
States withdrew its election observers for the runoff last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization of American States, the European Community and
the United States have been considering what steps to take,
including a suspension of aid, if the Haitian government seats a
new legislature whose legitimacy is questioned. Some $500 million
in foreign aid has already been untapped for several years because
of a political deadlock that has left this country without a
Parliament since January of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the threats, Haitian officials have refused to budge,
and last week they began to swear in mayors and local council
members. Electoral officials said the vote was fair, and that more
than 30 percent of the electorate voted. Opposition parties, who
boycotted the runoff, said many polling places were ghost towns
while others were reportedly the targets of armed thugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CEP's mission is to run elections transparently and
fairly,'' said Roland Sainristil, the spokesman for the Provisional
Electoral Council, using its French acronym. ``This is what has
been done on May 21, and this is what we have continued to do, to
put in place democratic institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles echoed the recent statements of the prime minister when
he said that any suspension of aid would have little impact, since
Haiti had already been grappling with a lack of international aid
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are ready to use our internal resources to implement
national programs that the government feels are necessary,'' he
said. ``Eventually, the international community will keep
explaining what is happening until Haiti is understood by all.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the recent elections said they already understood
what was happening: a consolidation of power by Lavalas that would
culminate in Aristide's election in November. They alleged that the
voting irregularities were carried out by Lavalas because it was
unsure of its support, even though it was the only party with any
sustained campaign presence.
</P>
<P>
   Protests by opposition parties outside of the capital have
resulted in arrests by police. Calling the new legislature
``illegitimate,'' they feared worse times ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this is a totally irresponsible attitude,'' said
Danile Supplice, a Senate candidate for the Espace de Concertation
party. ``What is going to happen is that Haiti is going to pay for
this. We cannot afford in the year 2000 to isolate ourselves. It
does not make any sense.''

HONG KONG UNIVERSITY WARNINGS THREATEN ACADEMIC FREEDOM, POLLSTER
SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ In a case that has stoked fears about academic
freedom in this former British colony, a prominent pollster said on
Friday he was warned by the head of Hong Kong University not to
publish surveys critical of the Beijing-appointed chief executive
of Hong Kong, Tung Chee-hwa.
</P>
<P>
   The pollster, Robert Chung, said the university's
vice-chancellor, Cheng Yiu-chung, told him through a deputy that
the university would ``dry up'' the financial support for his work
if he did not stop conducting polls on the popularity of Tung or
the post-colonial government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it was a very clear message,'' said Chung, at an
emotional news conference in which he broke down twice.
</P>
<P>
   Chung's disclosure capped a week of bitter accusations and
denials that began on July 7, when he wrote a column for the South
China Morning Post describing how he was pressured.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than once, I was given a clear message from Tung via a
special channel that my polling activities were not welcomed,'' he
wrote. `` Tung did not like me polling his popularity, or the
government's credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   A government spokesman, Stephen Lam, said Saturday that neither
Tung nor anybody on his staff had instructed the university to stop
polling.
</P>
<P>
   With Chung's decision to name names, a personal dispute has
escalated into a furious debate over whether Hong Kong is stifling
academic freedom. Such questions have been raised about press
freedom and the legal system since Hong Kong reverted to Chinese
rule in 1997. But its eight publicly funded universities have been
generally untouched by political pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is potentially more serious than those other disputes,
because Hong Kong's future depends on the free flow of
information,'' said Michael DeGolyer, a professor at Baptist
University who also conducts polls about the government. ``If Hong
Kong gains a reputation for limiting or restricting its news flow,
any hope of making this the financial center of Asia are gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Chung's surveys have revealed a marked deterioration in the
popularity of Tung _ a trend that DeGolyer's polls also show.
Although Hong Kong has rebounded from the Asian financial crisis,
this normally tranquil city has been disrupted by protests over
falling real estate prices and the lack of government reform.
</P>
<P>
   DeGolyer said Chung's polling methods were sound. But he noted
that the professor brought a ``pro-democracy'' perspective to his
work. Chung did not return calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute is a keen embarrassment for Hong Kong University,
one of the most highly regarded institutions in Asia. The
university said it would set up a commission to investigate Chung's
allegations. But student groups marched on the hilly campus,
calling for the vice-chancellor to resign.
</P>
<P>
   As chief executive of Hong Kong, Tung is the chancellor of the
university. But it is a ceremonial job, and the vice-chancellor
runs things.
</P>
<P>
   Academic freedom is not the only civil liberty in question here.
In April, a senior mainland Chinese official urged the local news
media not to report about the independence movement in Taiwan.
Another official said Hong Kong companies should not get involved
with pro-independence Taiwanese companies.
</P>
<P>
   For some here, the dispute is fresh evidence that Hong Kong is
adopting a Chinese-style political culture, where threats to civil
liberties are rarely made openly. They say that university
officials, knowing of Tung's unhappiness with the polls, may have
taken matters into their own hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a new culture in Hong Kong of second-guessing the
boss,'' said Martin Lee, a pro-democracy leader. ``That's what Tung
has been doing with the bosses in Beijing. And now we have the
practice here.''

BASEBALL NOTEBOOK: DUSTY BAKER'S SECRET; REDS GIVE UP; POOR YEAR
FOR ASTROS; ISRINGHAUSEN HAVING FUN 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The second month of the season had not ended, and the San
Francisco Giants were nine games from first place. Is that any way
to maintain a reputation for always being in the race? No, but look
again. The Giants are very much in the National League West race.
</P>
<P>
   It's the old Dusty Baker hocus-pocus. It is becoming a cliche
that Baker always has his team in contention, that he gets more out
of his players than most managers do out of theirs. But it is all
true. And now Barry Bonds has unveiled Baker's secret: It's the
food.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always brings food in every day,'' Bonds said. ``I got to
have my greens, macaroni and cheese. He always brings something. He
takes care of everybody. When he knows you're down and out, he does
something to perk you up. When you're struggling, he'll say: `Here,
I brought you lunch. You're looking a little weak. I want you to
get strong. You need to eat better.' He takes care of you.''
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing fancy about the food Baker provides his players,
Bonds said. ``Latin food, soul food, regular food. Dusty knows
every restaurant in every city, and he can get you whatever you
want in any city. I know that for a fact.''
</P>
<P>
   When Baker was informed that Bonds had blown his secret, he
readily acknowledged his nutrition contribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started when I was in Atlanta and Los Angeles,'' Baker
said, referring to his playing days. ``I learned it from Hank.''
That would be Aaron.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hank would get on me about eating better, more
nutritionally,'' Baker said. ``I learned from him, especially about
breakfast time before day games. In the seventh inning you wondered
why your legs were wobbly after a triple. You got to stay strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker said when he began coaching, ``I'd see guys coming in with
a bag from McDonald's or Arby's or Taco Bell, and they'd wonder why
they were tired late in the game. I believe in the guys eating
right. Especially on the road. It's more important on the road
because guys don't eat right on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker said he offered the players a variety of food, mentioning
collard greens, black-eyed peas, macaroni and cheese, grits, hash
browns, bacon, eggs, sausages. He estimated that he spends $50 or
$60 a day.
</P>
<P>
   The manager has another reason for bringing food to the
clubhouse for his players. ``I don't like to share my food with
anyone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Bonds' claim that Baker knows every restaurant in every
city, he said: ``That's close. They're not all the prettiest, but
they serve the best food.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of the job,'' he said of his one-man food delivery
service. ``You've got to be nutritionally strong. In the end only
the strong survive.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants survive nicely under Baker. This season is an
example.
</P>
<P>
   A seven-game losing streak in April? A seven-game winning streak
the first eight days of May. An eight-game losing streak in May? An
eight-game winning the first eight days of July. The Giants have a
way of canceling out their mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just steady,'' said Bonds, who in the first two games
after the All-Star Game hit his 29th and 30th home runs, giving him
475 for his career. ``We're a 200,000-mile car. We're a team that
just keeps going. We'll always be in the yard. Do we get through
the door? I don't know, but we're going to be in your yard.''
</P>
<P>
   And where there's a yard, there's a house.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have guys who like to play every day,'' Bonds said. ``We
don't have the best talent on the field. We don't have the best
team. We don't care that we don't. We care that when you come into
our house or we go into your house, you got a fight; you got a
game. You got to play. Then whatever comes, comes.''
</P>
<P>
   SLUMPING REDS CONCEDE
</P>
<P>
   When the Reds acquired Ken Griffey Jr. last February, they and
their fans figuratively (maybe some literally) danced in the
streets. Next stop, the World Series. Or at least the first round
of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Proving once again that there is no sure thing and that no one
player can single-handedly produce a division championship, the
Reds conceded their playoff chances last week by trading their best
pitcher to the Yankees. They kept their best hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics might place some of the blame on Griffey for the
disappointing season. He had difficulty getting out of the low
.200s the first two months of the season, and began post-All-Star
Game play hitting only .238. But he also was tied for second in
home runs and tied for fourth in runs batted in among National
League batters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's complaining, saying I'm having the worst year of
my career,'' Griffey said. ``But if you look at my numbers, the
only thing that's down is my batting average.''
</P>
<P>
   A .299 career hitter, Griffey hit .300 or better in seven of his
11 seasons with the Mariners. Two of his sub-.300 seasons came the
last two years when he hit .284 and .285. Why has he struggled with
his average this season?
</P>
<P>
   ``Just trying to do too much,'' he said. And why would that be?
``That's how it works. You want to get off to a good start in a new
atmosphere. You want to go out there and do some things. Sometimes
it works, sometimes it doesn't and you find yourself in a situation
you don't want to be in. You go out and work hard and do things to
try to get yourself better. That's all I can do. That's what I've
been doing.''
</P>
<P>
   But even a .300 Griffey average would most likely not have been
able to overcome the Reds' pitching deficiencies. Except for Denny
Neagle, now at a new address in New York, the Reds' starters have
struggled. The earned run averages tell the tale: Pete Harnisch
7.52, Ron Villone 5.98, Steve Parris 5.26. The staff ERA, 4.81,
placed the Reds halfway between the NL's lowest (Arizona's 4.21)
and highest (Houston's 5.41).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   REVERSAL FOR ASTROS
</P>
<P>
   They trade their 22-game winner, and the pitching staff falls
apart: Cause and effect?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hambone definitely had a great year,'' Shane Reynolds of
Houston said, speaking of Mike Hampton, now with the Mets. ``He was
our leader last year. Losing him definitely made a difference. But
to say that was the problem this year, I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds cited Enron Field, the Astros' new home, as the primary
culprit. ``We went to a new stadium that was hitter friendly,'' he
said. ``It took a little time to get adjusted to it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the All-Star Game break the Astros had a 30-57 record. They
played the same number of games before the All-Star Game last year
and had a 50-37 record. This season and last, Jose Lima pitched the
last game before the break. Last year he emerged from the game with
his 13th victory against four defeats en route to a 21-victory
season; this time he gained only his second victory against 13
defeats.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers attached to Lima's name this season are eye-opening.
Besides having the most losses in the league, he has allowed the
most runs, earned runs and home runs. His 7.36 ERA is more than
twice his season's 3.58 last year. The 29 home runs he gave up in
18 starts and 106 1/3 innings before the break were one shy of his
1999 total of 30 in 35 starts and 246 1/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has no physical problems, no mental problems,'' Reynolds
said. ``He still has the confidence. He got on a bad streak and
couldn't get off. He pitched seven good innings for us Sunday and
got a win. He said the second half is going to be different. He's
going to start over. He hasn't changed at all. I think that's
great, especially for a guy who goes from 21 wins to having a year
like this. He's still Jose Lima.''
</P>
<P>
   AN `AMAZING' EX-MET
</P>
<P>
   No player at the All-Star Game last week was more excited about
being there or more unlikely to be there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how it's possible that I'm here, especially all
the stuff I've been through,'' Jason Isringhausen said. ``I'm
pretty excited about this. It's an amazing feeling. I didn't know
if this day would ever come.''
</P>
<P>
   Isringhausen once upon a time was part of the foundation of the
Mets' future. He was a starting pitcher then. Now, one shoulder
operation and two elbow operations later, he is a relief pitcher
and the Oakland Athletics closer. Nineteen saves earned him a spot
on the American League All-Star team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun,'' Isringhausen said of his new job. ``I blew three
saves in a row, but it was still fun. That's part of the game. The
failure and the success all come together. I'm really enjoying this
role. I like it better than starting. I enjoy going out there for
one inning. I'm either going to succeed or fail. There are no
no-decisions out there.''
</P>
<P>
   It would seem to have been a master stroke by the Athletics to
have traded for Isringhausen last season with the idea of making
him their closer, but the Mets also had thought about the
possibility, even though they had John Franco.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had talked about it in the minor leagues,'' the 27-year-old
right-hander said. ``They thought I had the right makeup for it.
But with the guys in the big leagues at the time, there was no
sense in even fathoming it then because the guy with 400 saves is
ahead of you and it's hard to sneak in when you've never even
proven yourself.'' &QL;

SENATE DEMOCRATS EYE PENNSYLVANIA   SEAT; ILLINOIS PAPER CLIP
TRAIL; UTAH'S CONCERNED REPUBLICANS; A FLOOD OF BALLOT INITIATIVES
IN OREGON 
BY B. DRUMMOND AYRES JR.  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Ill., Utah, Ore.)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Democrats looking to regain control of the U.S. Senate this fall
had high hopes in the spring that they could deny a second term to
Rick Santorum, a Republican freshman from Pennsylvania. He squeaked
into office in 1994 with 49 percent of the vote, and the
conventional wisdom was that he was too conservative for a state
with more Democrats than Republicans and had done little since his
election to improve his standing with voters.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton flew into Philadelphia on Monday to campaign
for the Democratic challenger, Rep. Ron Klink, a moderate from
suburban Pittsburgh. He raised some money for him, roughly
$200,000, and gave Democratic hopes an extra boost when he labeled
the Santorum seat ``worth fighting for.''
</P>
<P>
   But those hopes slumped on Wednesday with the release of a poll
that showed Santorum with a 2-to-1 lead over Klink. And they sagged
even lower on Thursday with the release of a campaign finance
report that showed Santorum with nearly an 8-to-1 lead in campaign
funds, $4.3 million to $564,500.
</P>
<P>
   Putting the best face possible on the new reports, Democratic
leaders noted that the finance report did not include the
just-raised $200,000, and they pointed out that the poll found
almost a third of all voters still undecided _ many because they
knew little or nothing about Klink.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are right on track,'' Mary Keirnan, Klink's campaign
manager, declared.
</P>
<P>
   John Brabender, one of Santorum's political advisers, countered
that the poll and finance report showed that Klink ``has minimal
support from within his own party.''
</P>
<P>
   TALE OF A PAPER CLIP HAUNTS A CANDIDATE
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1980, when he was one of the newer members of the
Illinois House, state Rep. Timothy V. Johnson, a Republican from
the Champaign-Urbana area, rigged a paper clip so that it held the
``Yes'' voting button on his desk in the down position. When a
picture of the clip hit the newspapers, he first denied installing
it but later backtracked, saying such rigs were ``accepted
practice'' in the legislature and enabled members to vote on
legislation even when absent from the House chamber, especially at
times when votes were called while members were meeting with
constituents or working on other pressing matters.
</P>
<P>
   That explanation apparently satisfied voters in Johnson's
district. He still represents it 20 years later.
</P>
<P>
   But now he has his eye on a larger district, the 15th
Congressional, which has an open seat this year, and the photo of
the paper clip has come back to haunt him.
</P>
<P>
   His Democratic rival, Mike Kelleher, has dredged up the shot and
contends it says much about Johnson's worthiness to serve. He has
posted newspaper articles about it on the Web _ timspaperclip.com _
and is running ads about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows a pattern of behavior by Tim Johnson to avoid his
responsibilities and violate the trust his constituents placed in
him,'' Kelleher said last week. ``Voting is the reason you are
elected, and he delegated that responsibility to a piece of office
supply. This goes to character.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson says he is guilty of no wrongdoing and calls the
resurrected picture and stories ``a silly little red herring''
raised by ``a desperate candidate who is far behind.''
</P>
<P>
   GOP IS CONCERNED AT A CHANGE OF HEART
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Merrill Cook, a two-term Salt Lake City Republican, is
about as outspoken and unpredictable and controversial as any
legislator in Washington _ so outspoken and unpredictable and
controversial that even in a year when his party desperately needs
to re-elect every House incumbent, he was denied re-nomination in
last month's primary. His angry response to rejection: He just
might run in the fall as a write-in independent.
</P>
<P>
   That threat left Republican leaders deeply concerned. They
reasoned that while Cook had paid a high political price for loudly
and publicly feuding with them, members of his office staff and
even his campaign manager, he still had a following and just might
win running as an independent.
</P>
<P>
   Equally bad, they figured, if he did not win in his own right,
he might draw away enough votes to assure the defeat of the new
Republican nominee, Derek W. Smith, a little-known businessman up
against a formidable Democratic nominee, Jim Matheson, son of
former Gov. Scott M. Matheson.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Cook announced last week that he wanted to remain a member of
the Utah Republican Party. In fact, he said, he wanted to be
chairman of the Utah Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could help expand its base, bring peace to the party,'' he
explained.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker of the Utah House, Marty Stephens, one of the
state's leading Republicans, was left all but speechless by Cook's
change of mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to say,'' he told The Deseret News of Salt
Lake.
</P>
<P>
   But after a moment of reflection on a fellow politician he knows
well, he offered this: ``I would counsel Merrill to take his time.
He's had a bitter, bitter defeat.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook's response: He remains prepared to jump in the House
contest as an independent should Smith falter.
</P>
<P>
   BALLOT INITIATIVES HIT NEW HIGH IN OREGON
</P>
<P>
   Roughly half of the states authorize citizen ballot initiatives,
and more and more are showing up every election day as frustrated
voters and advocacy groups become more and more adept at gathering
the petition signatures required for ballot access.
</P>
<P>
   Debate is building around the country about whether initiatives
are being overused, or whether they are a reasonable substitute for
too little or too much legislative action. But in the absence of
any consensus on that, the petition process continues to pick up
speed.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is there more petitioning under way than in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, election officials say, Oregonians will be asked to
vote on at least 25 ballot measures. The issues include huge tax
cuts, forbidding teachers to speak favorably of homosexuality,
repealing the death penalty, banning animal trapping, requiring
background checks to buy firearms at gun shows and limiting the
amount of money spent on political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the initiatives are the work of perhaps the most
accomplished ballot petitioner in the country, Bill Sizemore,
director of Oregon Taxpayers United, a conservative group that sees
government, especially the Oregon Legislature, as a money
squanderer unresponsive to normal citizen complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Does Sizemore worry that he and his group are perhaps overdoing
the petition process by submitting half a dozen initiatives for a
single election?
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's counting?'' he replied the other day as he turned in
another batch of signatures.
</P>
<P>
   One person who was counting was Oregon's top elections official,
Secretary of State Bill Bradbury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll have the largest voters' pamphlet in history,''
Bradbury said. ``It'll be huge, like a phone book. I'm afraid that
voters will look at it as overwhelming.''

FLORIDA AWARD CLOUDS FUTURE TOBACCO ACTION IN SUITS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Conn.)   (DELETES ``person'' from lede)  
 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For more than a week, a six-member jury in a Miami courtroom
heard the song of the new cigarette industry.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, the chief executives of Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds
and other major tobacco companies appeared before the jury to tell
how they had turned over a new leaf. They had agreed to pay $246
billion to states to fight teen-age smoking and help pay for the
ills of injured smokers. Some executives told jurors of their
efforts to develop less dangerous cigarettes. And, they said, the
need to punish their companies with punitive damages was past.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami jury, when it reached its verdict on Friday, seemed to
respond as if it had not heard a word of the executives' testimony
or, perhaps worse, as if the industry's arguments had infuriated
the jurors more. After five hours of deliberations, they meted out
a stunning $144.8 billion punitive award to members of a
class-action lawsuit brought on behalf of all Florida residents
made sick by smoking.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the tobacco industry's arguments in the Miami
case could haunt it in future lawsuits or spur it toward an overall
settlement. But even if cigarette makers succeed in getting the
award sharply reduced, as many experts expect, or even thrown out,
the staggering size of the damage figure stunned some legal experts
and sounded alarm bells.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am perfectly willing to believe that the industry has done
all the things that the jury believes it has done,'' said Peter
Schuck, a Yale Law School professor who has testified as an expert
witness for a cigarette maker. ``But as a constitutional matter
this is a terrible way to govern ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   But others said that the tobacco industry had only itself to
blame for the verdict, given its decadeslong fight against
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This jury's verdict is probably a reflection of frustration at
the failure of other branches of government to hold this industry
accountable,'' said Matthew Myers, the president of the Campaign
for Tobacco-Free Kids in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   A juror, Gary Chwast, 30, a postal worker, told The Miami Herald
on Friday, ``You can't just say you're sorry after 50 years.'' The
Herald quoted other jurors as saying they wanted to ``send a strong
message based on the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts had another explanation: That a panel of six tired
people, who heard the case over two years, wanted to go home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury had his case for a really long time,'' said Clark
Freshman, an associate professor at the University of Miami Law
School. ``I suspect they had figured out that the punitive damages
could be reduced on appeal and that's why they went with a high
amount.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Miami jury's award is likely to be hotly debated by legal
experts and others for months. But in many ways, its size also
reflected the unique nature of the Florida case and how it
proceeded.
</P>
<P>
   For one, a class-action case against the cigarette industry had
never previously gone to trial. And the jury heard the case in
segments. Last year, for example, it found that cigarette producers
had conspired to mislead the public about the dangers of smoking.
In April, based on that decision, it awarded a record $12.7 million
in compensatory damages, or those intended to cover medical costs
and pain, to three smokers chosen to represent the class.
</P>
<P>
   Those findings set the stage for the latest part of the trial in
which the jury was asked to decide punitive damages, or those
intended to punish a company for its conduct, on behalf of the
entire class, a group estimated at 300,000 to 700,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The potential for a huge damage award had not been lost on the
cigarette makers. In May, they succeeded in getting a bill passed
by the Florida Legislature limiting to $100 million the amount of
money that a defendant had to post to appeal a verdict in a Florida
state case. Previously, defendants had to post the entire amount of
an award.
</P>
<P>
   The companies, along with state officials, had argued that
posting a bond to cover huge punitive damages in the case could
both bankrupt cigarette makers and jeopardize the $246 billion in
payments they are paying states as a result of lawsuit settlements
with the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the potential for immediate financial disaster
apparently averted, the stakes were still high as the punitive
damages phase of the trial unfolded. And as it did, tobacco
producers rolled out an argument against punitive damages that they
had been refining over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, it was that the industry had repented. Not only is
it paying the states billions, it no longer sends its top
executives to Congress to argue that smoking is not addictive and
does not cause cancer. It is open. It is honest. It is different.
The message did not play with the jurors.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman of the University of Miami said that he believed that
cigarette producers might have undercut themselves when they
testified they could not afford to pay substantial damages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the tobacco companies blew it when they argued
they had no money to pay for punitive damages,'' Freshman said.
``That probably made the jury disregard all their arguments.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Robert Rabin, a law professor at Stanford University, said he
believed the Miami jury turned a deaf ear to the industry, a sign
that could spell trouble for the industry as it faces punitive
damages in other cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``They shifted course and it didn't help them,'' Rabin said.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco industry lawyers like Gregory Little, associate general
counsel for Philip Morris, said they believed the structure of the
trial was so unfair and the jury's verdict so absurd that the
entire case will be thrown out on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   And while other class-action lawsuits are looming, Little said
he believed that they would never get to trial because class-action
lawsuits are a flawed legal vehicle for resolving smokers' claims.
</P>
<P>
   Others said that the Miami case would encourage more lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, anti-smoking advocates offered differing views.
While some expressed concern that the cigarette industry could use
the size of the award to cast itself in the role of legal whipping
boy, others, like Dr. David Kessler, the former head of the Federal
Food and Drug Administration, saw it differently
</P>
<P>
   Kessler, now the dean of Yale Medical School, said that no
matter what spin the industry or anti-smoking advocates put on the
award, the message of the jury was clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury award is less important for the money or whether any
group of smokers will see any of the damages,'' Kessler said,
``than it is for the future of the industry.''

BASKETBALL A BIG CONCERN FOR MOSS
</HEADLINE>
  By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is the time of year in the NFL when many players pack their
bags, kiss their wives and kids goodbye, give up their luxury homes
and move into a dormitory for a month. Oh, do players hate training
camp! The constant pounding, the bad food and the twice-a-day
practices in 100 percent humidity with coaches screaming at them.
Lovely.
</P>
<P>
   That may be why Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Randy Moss is
seemingly trying to delay the inevitable. With the Vikings' camp to
start next Sunday, Moss on Friday played the last of a handful of
basketball games in the Southern California Summer Pro League.
While most players try to get their last full nights of sleep, Moss
was working on his jump shot.
</P>
<P>
   Moss, who played high school basketball in West Virginia, has
never hidden his desire to play the sport professionally one day.
Surprisingly, the Vikings took a laid-back approach to their star's
participating in the summer hoops league. That attitude is
different from the one most organizations would take. Many coaches
would stay awake at night sweating out nightmares that Moss, the
best wideout in the game, was twisting an ankle or blowing out a
knee on the court.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a great personal risk for Moss. He is looking for
a contract extension worth more than the $56 million Keyshawn
Johnson received from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in April. Nothing
like a torn knee ligament after a dunk to ruin contract
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   As training camps begin in earnest this week, Moss and the
Vikings are among a number of interesting stories coming into the
summer practices. Minnesota has handed the reigns of its offense to
the second-year quarterback Daunte Culpepper. A risk, to be sure,
but Coach Dennis Green has taken risks before, and most have paid
off. After all, he drafted Moss, who was considered a risk because
of his off-the-field problems in high school and college. But Moss
has been a solid citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Here are 10 things to watch as camps open (sweat not included):
</P>
<P>
   1. THE BALTIMORE RAVENS
</P>
<P>
   The owner, Art Modell, is excited about his team, saying, ``This
is the most optimistic I have felt going into a training camp in
years.'' He should be thrilled. The team already has one of the top
defenses in the league, so the Ravens spent the off-season
upgrading the offense by adding the free agent tight end Shannon
Sharpe and by drafting Tennessee running back Jamal Lewis and
Florida wideout Travis Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore might be the surprise of the league this season, but
only if quarterback Tony Banks becomes a consistent leader.
</P>
<P>
   2. CHEMISTRY IN BUFFALO
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Rob Johnson took Doug Flutie's job at the end of
last season, and make no mistake, Flutie wants it back, and he is
not one to stay quiet if Johnson struggles. That situation could be
a running soap opera for much of the season.
</P>
<P>
   3. GIANTS MOVES
</P>
<P>
   Quietly, General Manager Ernie Accorsi had a tremendous
off-season. He has gotten the team's salary cap complications under
control, while completely revamping the offensive line and drafting
Ron Dayne. He also added Michael Barrow to pair with his pal Jessie
Armstead at linebacker. The Giants have more of an edge now, and if
they win, which will depend largely on the play of quarterback
Kerry Collins, Accorsi should be strongly considered for executive
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   4. THE DEFENDING CHAMPIONS
</P>
<P>
   With so much attention focused on the spending by the Washington
Redskins, it is easy to forget that St. Louis is still the Super
Bowl champ. The Rams' only significant change was drafting the
burner Trung Candidate, a wide receiver out of Arizona, giving them
even more speed. The challenge for the Rams is that the team will
surprise no one, and toward the end of last season, defenses had
begun to decipher quarterback Kurt Warner.
</P>
<P>
   5. TOM COUGHLIN'S LAST STAND?
</P>
<P>
   The Jacksonville Jaguars have been one of the more successful
franchises of the last few years, but Tennessee has outclassed them
in the playoffs. Time is short for the head coach, Tom Coughlin,
and the quarterback, Mark Brunell, who has not played a full season
since 1996 because of injury. If the Jaguars do not advance deep
into the playoffs, look for those rumors about Coughlin going to
Notre Dame to start yet again.
</P>
<P>
   6. BRAIN DRAIN
</P>
<P>
   The league lost quarterbacks Dan Marino and Steve Young to
retirement, and John Elway left the year before, but there is still
plenty of talent at the position. Troy Aikman, Drew Bledsoe and
Brett Favre will look to rebound from average seasons. Then there
is Peyton Manning, considered the best quarterback in the game.
</P>
<P>
   7. STAR RUNNERS
</P>
<P>
   The keys to two franchises are coming off devastating knee
injuries. The knee of Denver's Terrell Davis seems to be doing
fine, while Atlanta's Jamal Anderson is having some problems after
his reconstructive surgery. Both players must be completely healthy
if their teams are to make it back to the postseason. Meanwhile,
Atlanta coach Dan Reeves said he planned to run a more physical
training camp than last season. Reeves did the same thing on
occasion when he was in New York, to mixed results.
</P>
<P>
   8. THE WORST FRANCHISE
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland was the only team in the league not to score a
touchdown on an interception, kick, punt or fumble return last
season. But the Browns had an excuse. They are an expansion team.
Cincinnati, perhaps the worst franchise in sports, has no such
excuse. Wide receiver Carl Pickens wants out of town, and running
back Corey Dillon hates the team so much he has vowed to play only
six games next year, the minimum required to earn his fourth year
of eligibility and thus become a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   9. MERRY-GO-ROUND
</P>
<P>
   Seven teams changed coaches, but the coach with the toughest job
may be the Jets' Al Groh, who is following Bill Parcells. Coach Jim
Haslett in New Orleans also has a difficult task. He must get
inside the head of Ricky Williams, the space cadet running back who
has managed to alienate most of his teammates. If Williams starts
to run and stops complaining, the Saints could do some damage in
the average NFC West.
</P>
<P>
   10. THE BUCCANEER
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the single best free-agent acquisition was Tampa Bay's
signing of wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson. When their training camp
begins next Sunday, the team will see that Johnson is brilliant,
selfish and tough. Most of all, he's a winner.
</P>
<P>
   Agreement by Redskins
</P>
<P>
   Washington is closing in on signing its top two picks,
linebacker LaVar Arrington and offensive tackle Chris Samuels. The
team has basically agreed on the signing bonus language, which
would pay Arrington about $10.5 million and Samuels about $500,000
less.
</P>
<P>
   There is still work to be done, but agreeing on the bonus is
half the battle. Getting their two draft picks in camp would be a
major coup for the Redskins, a team many believe will make a run at
the Super Bowl.

ON THE OLYMPICS: SHATTERING BARRIERS FOR WOMEN IN TRACK
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Netherlands)  By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A half-century before Marion Jones, the greatest female
track-and-field athlete was Fanny Blankers-Koen of the Netherlands,
whose four gold medals at the 1948 London Olympics set a record
that Jones will try to break with five at the 2000 Summer Games in
Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Just as significant as Blankers-Koen's medals were the cultural
barriers she hurdled, the barriers that said women should not
compete in anything as vigorous and sweaty as track and field, that
they were unwomanly if they did, that they would not be able to
have children or would not succeed in sports as mothers, that their
careers would be or should be washed up long before the age of 30.
</P>
<P>
   She would not consider herself a feminist _ she admitted to
crying and wanting to leave the London Games because she missed her
two young children so fiercely _ but Blankers-Koen stood as an
important bulwark against the capsizing discrimination female
athletes experienced then, and to a lesser agree, today.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, she was named by track and field's world governing
body as the sport's top female athlete of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 30 in London, and people said I was too old, that it was
not good to be running if you had a baby, that you should do the
housekeeping rather than running in shorts in a stadium,''
Blankers-Koen, now 82, said last week from her home in Hoofddorp,
the Netherlands, outside of Amsterdam. ``They were not used to it,
but I was not listening to them. I did what I wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Her Olympic career actually began as an 18-year-old at the 1936
Berlin Games, when the unmarried Fanny Koen finished tied for sixth
place in the high jump and participated on a Dutch relay team that
took fifth. She did meet Jesse Owens in Berlin, marveled at his
four gold medals, got his autograph and even had a drink with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it must be nice to have just one medal,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   World War II intervened, however, and the Summer Games were
shelved for 12 years. She remained in the Netherlands during the
war, Blankers-Koen said, obtaining food from an uncle who had a
farm, thankful just for surviving, never thinking about training
for the Olympics. Finally, the Summer Games were renewed in London
in 1948. By then, she had married her coach, Jan Blankers, and was
the mother of a 7-year-old boy, Jan, and a 2-year-old daughter,
Fanny.
</P>
<P>
   Societal bias against female athletes was withering. Babe
Didrikson and other track athletes had been allowed to enter only
three events at the 1932 Los Angeles Games. Officials were so
alarmed by the exhausted conclusion of the 800-meter race at the
1928 Amsterdam Olympics that women would not be permitted to run
longer than 200 meters again until the 1960 Rome Olympics. Not
until 1984 would a women's marathon be added to the Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   Athletes who were mothers faced the accusation that they were
unfit parents whose place was in the home, not the homestretch.
Blankers-Koen ignored the complaints. She began competing again
when her daughter was 6 months old, taking her to meets around
Europe, carrying her in a little basket, breast-feeding in the
locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked my doctor about taking up sport and he said, `You are
breast-feeding, but try it,''' Blankers-Koen recalled. ``I had more
and more food for the girl than before.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the nine track and field events held for women at the London
Games, she won four _ the 100 meters, 200 meters, 80-meter hurdles
and the 400-meter relay. Her time in the hurdles, which have since
been extended to 100 meters, was an Olympic-record 11.9 seconds.
Before the 200 meters, she said she began crying, telling her
coach/husband that she wanted to return home to see their children,
who were staying with her parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not necessary for me that you are running,'' she said he
told her. ``But if you don't run, I'm sure you will be sorry for it
later on.''
</P>
<P>
   She remained in London, set an Olympic record of 24.3 seconds in
the 200-meter semifinal, won the final in 24.4, then anchored the
Dutch relay to her fourth gold medal, taking the baton in fourth
place and crossing the finish line first. She would undoubtedly
have won a fifth gold medal, considering that the winning distance
in the long jump was 22 inches shorter than her world record of
20-feet 6\ inches, but Blankers-Koen skipped the event because it
conflicted with the 200 meters.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband said it was better to win one gold medal than two
silvers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Blankers-Koen's long-jumping ability was so extraordinary that
Jones' first attempt this season _ 52 years later _ was only
three-quarters of an inch farther at 20-7. The two have met once,
and will undoubtedly meet again when Blankers-Koen travels to
Sydney to watch Jones try to eclipse her record for gold medals.
``I told her she should win more medals than I did,'' Blankers-Koen
said. ``She can do so many things.''

 &HT;    As church memberships grow, numbers of clergy decline
 &HT;    By Kim Sue Lia Perkes
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAYLOR, Texas _ Nobody sneaks in late for Sunday service at St.
James Episcopal Church.
</P>
<P>
   The pews creak loudly when congregation members take their
seats, a sign that the centuries-old country church with its
missing shingles and interior tiles needs a facelift.
</P>
<P>
   Repairs will come slowly as St. James' physical problems mask a
deeper wound that is cutting a wide swath through rural Central
Texas and the nation: A shortage of clergy in mainline
denominations, the lack of financial resources and the fact that
most seminary-trained ministers do not want to serve rural areas
have left many small-town congregations without full-time pastors
and declining membership.
</P>
<P>
   Presbyterians, Lutherans, Methodists and Episcopalians are
looking for solutions to the growing problem that is overshadowed
by the publicity surrounding the priest shortage in the Roman
Catholic Church. Without their female clergy and ecumenical deals
to share pastors, the pulpits in these denominations could be even
harder to fill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a huge shortage in the Presbyterian Church,'' noted
the Rev. E. Quinn Fox, vocation and admissions director at Austin
Presbyterian Theological Seminary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like being in a hot real estate market,'' he
added. ``People are not having difficulty finding positions who are
graduating from seminary, and that's a bit of an understatement.''
</P>
<P>
   The competition for clergy has left small churches in a bind.
Less than a fourth of the Presbyterian Church (USA) churches with
under 50 members have full-time pastors, according to statistics
provided by the denomination, which is affiliated with the Austin
seminary.
</P>
<P>
   Auxiliary Bishop Gregory Aymond of New Orleans, who has been
named the next bishop for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Austin,
said the decline in rural membership came as a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We build churches and we use the demographics of the time and
the rest of it is a guess,'' he said. ``You can have a thriving
parish in the 1950s and all of a sudden in the 1990s, no one is
living out there.''
</P>
<P>
   It is part of vicious circle with no easy solutions. Rural
congregations that lose full-time pastors usually experience a
membership decline. The fewer the congregation members, the less
likely it is the church will ever see a full-time pastor again.
Meanwhile, the number of rural congregations with fewer than 50
members is growing.
</P>
<P>
   Aymond, who until recently headed a New Orleans seminary, was in
Canada in June to attend a meeting of the Association of
Theological Schools, which includes Protestant, Catholic and Jewish
institutions. One of the things they all talked about during
informal discussions was their dwindling clergy, Aymond added.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all denominations there is a smaller number of people who
are willing to give a number of years to study and then to serve in
general and particularly in rural areas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The median salary range for Protestant pastors is around
$36,000, but rural ministers usually make less. If the church
provides a housing allowance, reimbursement for the pastor's
expenses, medical insurance and a retirement package it is not
unusual for a church to need more than $40,000 to $50,000 for a
full-time pastor.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Claude Payne of the Episcopal Diocese of Texas, which
includes the Hill Country, said no diocese is immune from the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been in the survival-nature culture for years and
years,'' he added. ``The same reason that a young person moves away
from a rural area for greater opportunities, so would clergy not
want to serve a rural area.''
</P>
<P>
   RURAL CHURCHES STRUGGLING
</P>
<P>
   A century ago in Texas, 90 percent of the population lived in
rural areas. Today, that number is less than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some young families living on the outskirts of urban areas, such
as Austin, drive to city churches that offer large, vibrant
congregations. As a result, mainline denominations struggle to keep
rural churches operating.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, members of the Dessau Cemetery Association, whose
ancestors are buried next to what was Dessau Lutheran Church, are
opposing a proposed sale of the church, which was built by German
settlers in 1876.
</P>
<P>
   Dessau Lutheran Church members voted to disband in 1994 because
they could not afford a full-time pastor and regular church
attendance had plummeted from a high of 130 five years earlier to
around 15. Today, the church is rented to a Baptist congregation
and the Southwestern Texas Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church
in America wants to sell the building and more than eight acres
surrounding the cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   ``My great-great grandparents are the ones that sold the
property for $1 an acre to begin with,'' said Charles Mueller, the
cemetery association president. It was the home church for both
sets of his grandparents and his mother and father, all of whom
were buried in the cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   The emotional pain felt by those whose heritage is tied to a
dying church is devastating, and can tamper with their faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``A church building is sacred space and has special
significance,'' Aymond said. ``It's small communities that have
developed not only in familiarity and family but in terms of their
faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Mainline denominations are doing everything they can to hold
onto their small churches, even if it means sharing social
ministries, clergy and the buildings themselves.
</P>
<P>
   At the triennial Convention Episcopal Church this month in
Denver, delegates passed a unity agreement that was approved last
year by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. It means, for
instance, that a Lutheran pastor in a rural area also could serve
as the pastor for the local Episcopal Church, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Hammering out the details, though, will take time _ a commodity
many small-town churches don't have.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Chrisman, 54, who runs a public relations firm in Austin,
is the lay vicar for St. James and plans to bypass seminary to
become a priest. He will be the first person in the diocese
ordained under a little-used church law, Canon 7, that will put him
on equal footing with seminary-trained priests.
</P>
<P>
   Chrisman will attend a new two-year academy developed by Payne
that will offer occasional weekend study for Canon 7 candidates who
will be able to pastor at more than one rural parish.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, Payne began making priests out of lay vicars
under another church law that restricts those ordained from working
for any parish other than the one they are assigned.
</P>
<P>
   Prebyterians and United Methodist have similar rules that permit
them to install pastors who can serve only a particular rural
church.
</P>
<P>
   Mainline denominations also rely on seminary students to fill
the pastor role in rural churches. ``We have several in small
congregations serving within 45 miles of Austin in all
directions,'' said Douglas Cannon, spokesman for the Southwestern
Texas Conference of the United Methodist Church. Many of the
conference's seminarians attend Austin Presbyterian Theological
Seminary. About 25 percent of the Presbyterian seminary's students
are Methodists.
</P>
<P>
   In one very basic example of a denominational agreement, the
Southern Baptist Church and the United Methodist Church in
Driftwood, in northern Hays County, worship together as one
congregation. Eighty-three years ago, the Baptist church was blown
away in a storm and the United Methodists invited them in. The
Baptists never left.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Joe Trull of Wimberley, a retired Southern Baptist
ethics professor and the editor of Christian Ethics Today magazine,
and the Rev. Floyd Vick of Austin, a retired United Methodist
minister, perform the service on alternate Sundays for the
congregation that numbers less than 50 people.
</P>
<P>
   The pastors' combined annual salary is $13,200.
</P>
<P>
   SEMINARY COSTS PROHIBITIVE
</P>
<P>
   The cost of becoming a minister also makes it harder for
small-town churches to find and keep pastors.
</P>
<P>
   While Austin's Presbyterian and Episcopalian seminaries try to
help students graduate without racking up big debts, that education
on top of what a student may owe for undergraduate school is
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, a seminary education is four years of college and
four years of seminary,'' said Vick. ``There are ministers going
out into ministry $70,000 to $80,000 in debt.''
</P>
<P>
   The dropout rate for newly ordained Protestant clergy is high in
their first year, even among those who secure positions in big-city
churches. Low salaries make it almost impossible to meet their
financial obligations, Vick added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say what you want about a matter of faith, but the reality is
you have to pay your debt,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Starting salary for seminary graduates is usually less than
$30,000 a year, and many rural churches cannot afford to pay even
that, Vick said.
</P>
<P>
   At least one mainline denomination, the Lutheran church, is
looking into the possibility of buying student seminary loans that
can be repaid at low or no interest if the pastor will take a rural
congregation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly not a profession that gives you monetary
rewards and it's not as secure as it used to be,'' Trull said.
</P>
<P>
   There are some financial bright spots. The average age of those
entering seminary is around 38, meaning they are second-career
people and do not have the burden of an undergraduate debt. And
alternative programs, like the Episcopalians' lay vicars, do not
drain the financial resources of small congregations or dioceses.
Lay vicars work for free.
</P>
<P>
   However, as in the huge Roman Catholic Church, the average age
of mainline clergy is graying. Besides older seminary graduates,
many denominations have tapped their retirees to help take the
burden off rural congregations.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion of growth in the Southwest and the South has
further burdened the clergy load. New and growing churches create a
bigger need for ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Without female clergy, mainline denominations would be
experiencing a clergy crisis similar to the one in the Roman
Catholic Church. Today, there are fewer than 50,000 priests serving
the nation's 62 million Catholics _ and their average age is 58.
</P>
<P>
   The number of men entering seminary has significantly declined
in other mainline denominations as well. For instance, the
Evangelical Lutheran Church in American has seen a 25 percent drop
in male seminarians. Many seminaries _ including the Episcopal
Theological Seminary of the Southwest and the Austin Presbyterian
Theological Seminary _ have as many or more female seminarians as
they do males.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the major reasons Methodists, Lutherans and
Episcopalians allow women pastors is because they can't get enough
men to answer the call to pastor,'' said the Rev. Harold O'Chester,
pastor of Great Hills Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   Great Hills is part of the nation's largest Protestant
denomination, the Southern Baptist Convention, which in June barred
ffemale pastors. O'Chester believes the Bible makes it clear women
do not have the authority to teach over men, excluding them from
the role as pastor.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders in mainline denominations disagree, saying they believe
women and men are equally called by God to ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Baptists do not require ministers to have seminary
training. Any Southern Baptist pastor or congregation can ordain a
minister into the fold.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was pastoring in Dripping Springs, we ordained a young
man who is right now going to some correspondence theological
courses in San Antonio,'' said David Smith, the executive director
of the Austin Baptist Association. However, he added, it is not
unusual for a rural Baptist pastor to also have a full-time secular
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to or he'd starve to death,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the future, parishioners can expect to see more small
congregations merge, more itinerate clergy serving rural
congregations and more non-seminary-trained ministers pastoring
country churches.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine with most congregation members as long as they can
keep their doors open.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were down to very few people here,'' said Becky Kelley, a
parishioner at St. James in Taylor. ``We were worried it would
close.'' Since Chrisman came to the church, Kelley said, she has
not missed a Sunday except because of illness or vacation. Under
Chrisman's leadership, the church has more than doubled its
congregation to 50, Payne said. But it isn't just numbers that
count, he added.
</P>
<P>
   St. James now has a vibrant social ministry and Bible discussion
group. Congregation members said after years of worrying about
their future, they now look forward to Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dale's being here is an experiment and it's worked,'' said
parishioner Bob Lindquist. ``He's doing a fantastic job here.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Sunday, an acolyte pulled the rope of the
high-pitched bell that has rung out at St. James since 1885.
Chrisman processed to the altar and said, ``Good morning and
welcome to St. James on another beautiful day.''

 &HT;    More families are choosing cremation when looking for a
meaningful way to say goodbye
 &HT;    By Julie Ardery
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ ``It's an irreversible decision,'' Chet Robbins
advises me.
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes. To stretch this body out and bake it for two hours at
1,600 degrees reduces my decision-making powers, and me, to about 4
pounds of crumbled bone. There goes the figure-skating career. . .
.
</P>
<P>
   At the subject of cremation even Robbins, who as executive
director of the Texas Funeral Service Commission should be used to
this type of thing by now, clicks off the joviality and turns a
dour, professional gray. It wasn't so long ago, he says, ``People
would have asked, `What's cremation?' '' Traditional funerals, with
embalming, caskets, religious services and ground burial in a
family plot, weren't really matters of choice. They were the rule.
</P>
<P>
   Not so today. More and more people are choosing to be cremated.
The state's Bureau of Vital Statistics reports that in Texas the
rate of cremation almost doubled between 1989 and 1998, rising from
7 percent to nearly 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Funerals, too, are changing. Grieving families, rather than
turning to church liturgy, increasingly want to design rituals all
their own, eccentric ceremonies that find mourners perched on bar
stools or gathered at the pole of Enchanted Rock. Says Lamar
Hankins, president of the Austin Memorial and Burial Information
Society, ``People have learned that there's no correct way to do
it, that you can do many, many things to help family and friends
work through the grief process, so a lot of creativity has begun to
enter into this.''
</P>
<P>
   As the final acts of our just-lost lives, funeral practices have
been bound by iron traditions. The fear and permanence of death
tended to drive even the most freewheeling survivors back to ``the
green, green grass of home,'' to religious sacraments and to a
funeral parlor in the old neighborhood. Bigger than the senior
prom, sadder than a wedding _ or most weddings, anyway _ funerals
have resisted vagaries of fashion, taste, even price. Death has
never been when we've exercised what Hankins calls ``creativity'' _
at least never before. But now the goopy organ music is fading and
the stolid oak coffin is giving way. The rising incidence of
cremation glows as proof. We are special, and we want special ways
to be dead.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Deckert a native of San Antonio, died two years ago. His son
Bryan, who manages Mezzaluna restaurant in Austin, said his father
had made known to the family his wish to be cremated. ``He'd had a
love affair with the Bay Area, with all the sports teams out there.
And he knew he was dying,'' Bryan Deckert says. ``He asked if when
he died he could be cremated and left in San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulfilling these wishes was awkward for some family members
``who have strong religious ties,'' Bryan Deckert admits. More in
keeping with custom, a small ceremony was arranged in San Antonio,
at the graveside of Ron's parents. And then Bryan flew to San
Francisco, meeting his mother and brother to carry out his father's
request. ``We took him to Candlestick Park.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryan explains, ``In the south end zone at Candlestick, Dwight
Clark caught a touchdown pass that's kind of lore.'' In the last
minute of the NFC Championship game, Jan. 10, 1982, Clark leapt up
and into the history books, making what fans ever since just call
``The Catch.'' With that miracle snag, the 49ers beat the Dallas
Cowboys by one point. Deckert calls it ``one of the great comebacks
of all time.''
</P>
<P>
   Thoroughly modern mourners, the Deckerts did what pilgrims do.
They traveled to a ``sacred'' place to pay their respects. And
while Bryan Deckert didn't talk about theology or faith in
recounting this story, isn't some inkling of the afterlife really
``the great comeback of all time''?
</P>
<P>
   Many cemeteries and some local churches have special niches or
gardens for the committal of funeral urns. But, like the Deckerts,
a lot of families today want utterly personal ceremonies in quirky,
unchurchy places. Cremation makes these one-of-a-kind rites
possible. In and around Austin, such unconventional services happen
all the time as ashes, more properly called cremains, are scattered
at the Umlauf Sculpture Garden, the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower
Center, the Zilker Botanical Gardens _ really, anywhere that
survivors find fitting.
</P>
<P>
   Texas does not clearly regulate the scattering of cremains.
``Apparently the laws about ashes are pretty broad,'' says Janet
Maykus director of spiritual care and bereavement services at
Hospice Austin. ``The only thing you can't do with ashes is harass
someone.''
</P>
<P>
   Hankins, of the burial information society, adds that cremains
are ``nontoxic, so there really are no environmental issues to be
concerned about.''
</P>
<P>
   Scattering ashes IS illegal in national parks, according to Rob
Trippet park manager at the Enchanted Rock State Natural Area.
``You basically have to sneak in and do it without telling anybody.
And if it's happening out here, then that's probably what they're
doing.'' In the year and a half since Trippet became supervisor of
the big, mystic purple outcropping in Llano County, only one park
visitor has ``actually called up and said, `Is it OK if we come and
bring Uncle Jim out and sling him out over the back side of the
rock?' Most of it is `Don't ask, don't tell,' on a lot of this kind
of stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Peel, director of Austin-Peel and Son Funeral Home, says
he often hears about memorials at ``Town Lake, the river, Mount
Bonnell, or like up on Lake Travis, somewhere up in that area where
maybe the old gentleman that's cremated has been fishing a lot.''
Peel knew a UT science professor who asked that his ashes be
scattered around the biology building and another friend whose
widow surreptitiously sprinkled his remains over a local golf
course. ``We've had 'em take 'em to Hawaii, we've had 'em take 'em
down to the coast. It kind of goes back to the person and what they
enjoyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Enjoyed? Whatever happened to dirges, to pulling over as a
hearse, two limousines and a line of cars, lights beaming at
midday, roll past? What happened to Jackie Kennedy, looking blank
beneath a sheer black veil? Today's bereaved seem to want something
else, an upbeat occasion that deflects sorrow and dwells on ``the
good times.''
</P>
<P>
   Hankins respects, even advocates, these new funeral rites.
``Most people who have memorial services find them to be far more
important ways to remember the life of someone who has died. The
focus of the memorial service is more on the life of the deceased
rather than on the dead body.'' From this perspective, the
vanishing act of cremation makes sense. It takes the corpse out of
the picture and frees survivors to carry out any kind of memorial
in any place, or places, they choose.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone shares this view.
</P>
<P>
   ``This society is a death-denying society,'' says Barry J.W.
Franklin manager of King-Tears Mortuary. Franklin contends that
it's important for mourners to view the deceased: ``It helps set in
the reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Peel agrees. ``Part of the grief process is to view. I've
had people come in here where we've even had a closed casket, and
they leave and they've said, `Well, I didn't know if that was my
friend Joe in that casket or just a casket sitting there,' because
they didn't get to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Among African-Americans and Hispanics, cremation has never been
popular. The Cremation Society of North America, reported that of
cremations in 1996-97, 88 percent of the decedents were white, 6
percent were African-Americans, 3 percent were Asians and 3 percent
were Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   In part, these are religious differences. The Roman Catholic
Church forbade cremation until 1962, in keeping with its creed of
the body's resurrection. Under Vatican II, the church approved a
new Canon Law lifting the ban but still recommends burial of the
dead. Even under the revised canon, the Catholic Church does not
condone the scattering of ashes; cremains are to be buried intact.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Charles Villasenor II director of Mission Funeral Home
in Austin, says his largely Hispanic clientele continues to prefer
traditional burial. He estimates that less than 10 percent of his
customers choose cremation and says that the practice is even rarer
south of the border; Villasenor adds that families may choose to
precede cremation with more familiar rites _ embalming, viewing and
visitation _ and many families do.
</P>
<P>
   At Franklin's funeral home, with its majority African-American
clientele, the number of cremations has ``about stayed the same if
not gone down.'' Of 325 decedents at King-Tears Mortuary last year,
``we probably had about 12 cremations,'' he says. ``A lot of my
cremations are Anglo.''
</P>
<P>
   Among blacks, too, there are religious reasons why people choose
caskets and ground burial. According to Franklin, ``There are some
churches in the African-American community that say cremation is
contradictory to the Bible. A lot of preachers put that out, saying
that if you're cremated, you're going to hell.'' Yet, he says, the
preference for traditional funeral services is even more a matter
of social custom and cultural importance.
</P>
<P>
   African Americans tend to go all out for weddings and funerals,
Franklin says. ``They have that support from family, friends and
especially churches.'' He says that the black community pulls
together in force for people in bereavement. ``Some churches have
benevolent committees that come to the house, clean up. They answer
the phone, do the chores,'' sitting with the family ``all the way
until the day after the funeral.''
</P>
<P>
   Cremation has always been a far less expensive means of
disposition than conventional burial practices. According to
Hankins, three companies in Austin offer direct cremation for about
$800, while a full-service funeral with embalming and a casket plus
gravesite expenses costs thousands more. And now, funeral directors
say, clients are more cost-conscious than ever. ays Peel, ``To
call funeral homes and find out prices _ people didn't do that.
They just had a particular traditional funeral home they used, and
they went to it. But now there's hardly a day goes by we don't have
people call and ask'' about costs.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, though, it's the more affluent person who tends to
choose cremation. ``The more highly educated people are, the more
cremation is done,'' says Peel. It takes more than thrift to
disrupt formidable burial rituals. Forces other than price are
obviously driving the change.
</P>
<P>
   Maykus, of Hospice Austin, thinks dwindling church membership
has had a dramatic effect on funeral rites. ``For people who are
involved in a religious body, to veer from the tradition would be
difficult. This is what happened with your ancestors. This is what
you hope will happen with your children. It's this real binding
experience.'' But, she says, ``For people who aren't
tradition-bound and that's not their worshipping community, I think
that oftentimes very liturgical ceremonies are empty. That's when
it becomes important to personalize your services.''
</P>
<P>
   Hankins notes, too, that ``The baby boom generation is getting
into their 50s now, and they're beginning to think about traditions
with respect to their own parents. They're used to not necessarily
doing things the way that was expected just a few years ago.''
Others choose cremation, he says, as the ``environmentally sound
thing to do'' and ``for the simplicity of it.''
</P>
<P>
   But as California and Florida tellingly lead the nation, it
seems cremation is here to stay, a drastic but logical solution to
the problem of last rites in a mobile society. In former
generations, relatives visited and tidied up the family plot every
other week or so. In these times, who recognizes Decoration Day?
</P>
<P>
   With cremation, Maykus says, unless religious beliefs proscribe
otherwise, the ashes can be split among survivors and left at
several meaningful places: Austin, Boston, the Biltmore Hotel and
Hamilton, Ohio, too. For the loss of handkerchiefs and solidarity,
creativity is rushing in with condolence in a thousand forms.
</P>
<P>
   For highly religious people, these roll-your-own rituals may
seem trivializations of death. Others may find the end-zone funeral
a complete and satisfying form of mourning. Most of us, Maykus
says, ``are a little bit in both worlds,'' both reaching back to
custom and tinkering to ``find out what is it that is comforting
and binding and grounding.''

 &HT;    UPS delivers forceful blow to Postal Service overhaul
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Last spring, United Parcel Service drivers descended
on Capitol Hill to make an important delivery for their company:
brown corrugated boxes filled with materials attacking the U.S.
Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
   Every member of Congress got one of the computer laptop-sized
boxes. Tucked inside was a slick CD entitled, ``What the Postal
Service Doesn't Want You to Know.'' There were also negative news
articles and a 16-page booklet that compared the nation's daily
mail delivery service to the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   Spreading negative information about political opponents is
hardly a new game in Washington, where it's practically a blood
sport.
</P>
<P>
   But the hand delivery of 535 boxes stands out because it shows
the length that the Fortune 500 company is willing to go to and the
method the company uses to keep a competitor at bay.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, UPS wanted to stall legislation introduced by Rep.
John McHugh (R-N.Y.) that would overhaul the way the Postal Service
does business. At issue was a provision in the bill that would have
allowed the Postal Service to set its own pricing, which would have
made the service more competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Postal Service officials dispute that they are the ``giant,
uncontrolled monopoly'' that UPS says they are, claiming the
service is facing a projected decline of $17 billion in first-class
mail service between 2003 and 2008.
</P>
<P>
   But UPS contends that the Postal Service is a monopoly because
federal law prohibits other delivery services from entering the
daily mail service.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Postal Service is not required to pay local,
state or federal taxes.
</P>
<P>
   UPS TAKES THE OFFENSIVE
</P>
<P>
   So UPS went to war. In addition to delivering the boxes, UPS
successfully lobbied a number of state legislatures to pass
resolutions calling on Congress to rein in the Postal Service's
``monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   They also launched a letter-writing campaign to persuade members
of Congress to kill McHugh's legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Postal Service continues to abuse its monopoly power,''
said Jim Kelly, chief executive officer of UPS, describing why he
opposes the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation ``would allow them to expand that (monopoly) and
use their monopoly to compete with the private sector,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly thinks the Postal Service should be overhauled, but he
doesn't want it to have the flexibility to change its pricing.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, UPS' persuasion won. The legislation made it out of
a subcommittee of the House Government Reform and Oversight
Committee, but it is doubtful that it will even be brought up for a
vote at the committee level.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that is due to the way the company reaches out to
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am just in awe and admiration of their lobbying efforts,''
said Robert Taub, McHugh's chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   As the staff director of the subcommittee overseeing the Postal
Service, Taub has watched UPS' lobbying forces derail McHugh's
legislation every year for the past six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got every delivery service on board except UPS,'' Taub
said. FedEx, Emory and DHL are supporting the overhaul, but UPS
refuses to support it. ``They don't want to allow the Postal
Service any degree of flexibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Given UPS' influence on Capitol Hill, Taub is doubtful that
McHugh's legislation will pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have really cranked this up,'' he said. ``My view is that
the amount of money they spent to stall HR 22 is about the same
amount of money they would have lost if the Postal Service were
allowed to be competitive in the e-commerce market.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of UPS' success on Capitol Hill is cranking out money to
politicians, observers say. The company's political action
committee donated $613,210 to Republican candidates this election
season and $258,010 to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   That's only part of the money spent. UPS shelled out $1.8
million to wine and dine lawmakers last year on a host of issues,
including the competition for the air route to China, in support of
funding the Federal Aviation Authorization and normalizing trade
with China.
</P>
<P>
   In this high-stakes election year, UPS has given $913,409 to
Republican Party committees and $37,250 to Democratic committees.
Those contributions, known as ``soft money,'' are intended for
party building expenses. But more often than not, they are used to
pay for ``issue ads,'' which are often thinly veiled campaign ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question; they are an important player on Capitol
Hill,'' said Sen. Max Cleland (D-Ga.), who regularly meets with UPS
officials. ``They are one of Georgia's finest companies.''
</P>
<P>
   A PROVEN DEAL MAKER
</P>
<P>
   Few legislative issues reveal UPS' deal-making power more than
the delivery service's fight to keep the Postal Service out of the
e-commerce market.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a projected revenue decline, the Postal Service is
searching for other revenue-generating markets. But it is
prohibited from competing because of rules that were set three
decades ago, well before the Internet and e-mail became
commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to admire the job they've done over the years,'' said
Deputy Postmaster General John Nolan about the way UPS has been
able to stall McHugh's legislation.
</P>
<P>
   However, Nolan is less than pleased with the way UPS has, in his
view, ``distorted'' the truth in defeating postal reform
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd love to pay taxes if we made money,'' Nolan said of the
service, which had $63 billion in revenue last year and a net
income of $363 million. ``We barely break even every year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it demeans them to continue to take actions the way
they have to try to preclude us from having a level playing field
and allowing us to compete,'' he said. ``To try behind the scenes
to keep us from doing the things we can do for the American people
is just wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Nolan argues that UPS is actually the one with the unregulated
monopoly since it controls 80 percent of the ground delivery
service.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are trying to pawn themselves off as a private company,''
said Tad Segal, UPS director of public relations in Washington.
``They say they have an unlevel playing field? That's a gross
misuse of facts.''

 &HT;    UPS exec pushes Internet frontiers
 &HT;    By Janita Poe
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Like most of the top brass at UPS, Joe Pyne began his
career with the company as a part-time truck loader, during the
late 1960s to help pay for his college education.
</P>
<P>
   After working four years as a driver and truck loader, he donned
a white collar in 1973 and joined the sales department. Since then,
Pyne has moved up the ranks of the $27.1 billion company, which is
credited with delivering 6 percent of the gross domestic product
annually. Pyne became senior vice president of marketing and
corporate development in 1996, the year UPS launched its e-commerce
strategy, which he oversees.
</P>
<P>
   At the UPS headquarters recently, Pyne talked about his
company's investment of $11 billion in technology over the last
decade and its plan to push more broadly into global e-commerce
with electronic billing advancements, enhanced technology-based
delivery systems and comprehensive consulting services for
businesses that contract with UPS.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, Pyne stressed that e-commerce is not an
isolated business concept but one that soon will become part of the
fabric of business activity across the United States. ``Everyone
calls it e-commerce,'' Pyne said. ``But two years from now, no one
will call it that. It will just be commerce. It's the way we will
do business.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is United Parcel Service's main e-commerce mission?
</P>
<P>
   A: The main mission is to have UPS everywhere business is
conducted by our customers. This allows our customers to serve
themselves. We are giving them a competitive advantage by providing
them with the tools that will help them run more efficiently and to
give better service to their own customers. Our strategy has been
to embed these tools into all the top software and networked
systems so we're readily accessible, but it's the customer's choice
of that software or system. With our information and delivery
network, they can bring more value into their own businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How has UPS adjusted to the changes created by e-commerce?
</P>
<P>
   A: We look at our customers from a different point of view now.
And we are able to provide more services to them, helping to manage
their total costs, order management, inventories, customer service,
repair and return needs and even capital and risk as well as
transportation. We now can enable global commerce by integrating
UPS technology solutions into our customers' business procedures.
We are taking UPS far beyond the traditional package delivery role;
we now are offering companies complete business solutions; that's
the flow of goods, information and funds.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What e-commerce concerns are you responsible for in your role
as senior vice president of marketing and corporate development?
</P>
<P>
   A: I oversee e-commerce that ranges from more complex customized
management from UPS Worldwide Logistics to the new business models,
opportunity and turn-key solutions developed by our E-Ventures
group. It also includes choosing technology partners and
determining the tools we develop, both information and financial
tools.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Forbes named UPS ``company of the year'' this past January,
and its report said UPS was ``the missing link in Web retailing.''
Can UPS and other delivery companies continue to manage the rapid
growth of orders that we are seeing with the growth of Internet
commerce?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Forbes article focused on retailing. But I believe
business-to-business is the main focus of e-commerce. It's the
whole purchasing function and the pooling of resources between
companies that technology allows. We're successful at managing the
growth of Net activity, because we give our customers choices from
so many services across the full transportation and information
network that they don't have to build themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Reports show that UPS has invested $11 billion into
technology in the last decade. On what has UPS spent most of that
money?
</P>
<P>
   A: We have spent most of that money on two main areas. The first
is on communication technology for our employees including PCs, the
DIADs (Delivery Information Acquisition Device) for our drivers,
our extensive cellular network and operations in our buildings. The
second is on solutions for our customers such as software and
shipping systems and the tools that are being integrated into their
processes to give access to that information.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How has UPS changed since you began your career in 1969?
</P>
<P>
   A: It has changed faster and faster every year. We went from
being a trucking company to flying airplanes to offering delivery
solutions to customers all over the world. Now we're deeper into
our customers' business processes, helping them manage their entire
supply chains and taking away some of their risk with insurance and
financial products.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Like most of the other 14 members of UPS' Management
Committee, you started as a truck loader and occasional driver for
four years before you moved into management. How does the fact that
you and the other top leaders at your company started out as truck
workers and drivers affect the corporate culture? A: It is one of
the core strengths of our business. It helps us understand what our
customers and drivers are dealing with. It also demonstrates to our
own people that there's tremendous opportunity to grow here.

 &HT;    Parcel service lobbies against Delta, other rivals for Beijing
air route.
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The drivers of those chocolate brown trucks with gold
lettering are known for moving packages at the ``speed of
business'' from one door to another.
</P>
<P>
   But the nation's largest parcel delivery service is finding that
moving packages is a lot easier than moving Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Brown,'' as the company is commonly called, is vying for a
lucrative air route to China against another Atlanta-based
powerhouse, Delta Air Lines, as well as American Airlines and Polar
Air Cargo, an upstart freight carrier based in California.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Transportation is expected to announce
the winner this summer after it has sifted through the 1,711
documents filed by the competitors during the courtlike eight-month
process.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing less than $1 billion _ and that's just to start _ is at
stake with the selection of the new China carrier. As the Chinese
economy continues its exponential expansion, that amount is certain
to grow.
</P>
<P>
   This marks the first time in the DOT's history that the agency
will have to decide between a freight carrier and a passenger
airliner for an air route.
</P>
<P>
   With that kind of money and market up for grabs, it is no
surprise that the airlines involved have hired the kind of help
that works in Washington: influence.
</P>
<P>
   American has secured the support of Chicago Mayor Richard M.
Daley, the brother of former Commerce Secretary William Daley, who
is now engineering Vice President Al Gore's presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   Delta has hired former Kentucky Sen. Wendell Ford, a key
Democratic leader on aviation _ not to mention Haley Barbour, the
former Republican Party chairman and one of Washington's most
powerful lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   Polar Air is hoping that big money won't mean much at DOT
headquarters. The company has just one lobbyist in Washington, and
he is an employee of the 6-year-old company. Polar has spent so
little on lobbying that it is not even required to file a report
with Congress, as all of the other companies are required to do.
</P>
<P>
   Under the department's own rules, the decision is supposed to be
devoid of lobbying and politics.
</P>
<P>
   So why are the well-known contenders spending so much money and
hiring so many big names to sell their pitch?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll leave that for them to answer,'' said Kevin Montgomery,
Polar's sole man in Washington. ``Our hope is that the Department
of Transportation will make their decision in a fair and equal
manner based on the merits of the case. I don't think it's fair to
ask for anything different.''
</P>
<P>
   UNPARALLELED LOBBYING
</P>
<P>
   But Montgomery is also a pragmatist. He knows that millions are
being spent by the competition to lobby lawmakers. ``It's
unfortunate that they think they could buy votes, buy legislation,
buy a decision in this case,'' he said, referring to the culture of
lobbying in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the moratorium on lobbying the DOT, nothing prohibits
the carriers from hitting Capitol Hill and talking to the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   The result, by most accounts, has been an unparalleled lobbying
campaign for an air route.
</P>
<P>
   UPS, the competitors say, has taken the fight beyond the point
of fair, using strong-armed tactics and raising questions about its
competitors to win over Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Fair or not, UPS' strategies so far seem to be working: At
present, 350 members of Congress, 37 governors and more than 80
local officials are siding with the $27 billion-a-year company,
according to letters filed with the DOT.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of unfortunate that we are pitted against our good
friends and good neighbor here in town, Delta, but it's a situation
that is created by the process,'' said Jim Kelly, chairman and
chief executive officer of UPS. Kelly said that he can't imagine a
UPS employee saying anything negative about the competition.
</P>
<P>
   UPS has been salivating over the possibility of flying directly
to China ever since Beijing signed an agreement with the United
States last spring to allow one new carrier and as many as 10
round-trip flights per week starting in April 2001.
</P>
<P>
   It wants to expand its Asian market, a place where business is
up by 50 percent over the last year. While archrival FedEx Corp.
flies directly to mainland China, UPS must land in Hong Kong and
then rely on another carrier to transport packages. That gives
FedEx a competitive advantage over UPS in that FedEx's shipments
arrive a full day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   FedEx, United Airlines and Northwest Airlines already fly
directly to China and are lobbying the White House and Capitol Hill
for a sliver of the new batch of flights.
</P>
<P>
   The UPS campaign was the first to get started in the competition
for the air route. To make its case, the company hired former U.S.
Trade Representative Mickey Kantor and economist Joseph Stiglitz,
both close allies of President Clinton _ and it has sought the
advice of several former transportation officials on how best to
present its case.
</P>
<P>
   UPS has blanketed Capitol Hill with thick packets of information
about why the DOT should choose a cargo carrier instead of a
passenger carrier. Trade trumps tourism is the theme.
</P>
<P>
   By promising to hire 1,200 American workers if it wins, UPS has
been able to portray itself as the ``labor candidate'' in this
high-stakes contest. Teamsters President Jimmy Hoffa has written to
Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater in support of UPS even
though the union fought against normalizing trade with China.
</P>
<P>
   ``You either take part or you get taken apart,'' said Tad Segal,
director of public relations at UPS' Washington office, explaining
how deals are struck in Washington. ``It's been a good, clean
fight. Everyone is slugging as hard as they can.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not how the competition sees it.
</P>
<P>
   When Delta canvassed Capitol Hill for support, it found that Big
Brown had already been there.
</P>
<P>
   D. Scott Yohe, Delta's senior vice president of government
affairs, said the lobbying has been ferocious.
</P>
<P>
   Yohe said lawmakers have told him that UPS has portrayed Delta
as not ``really interested'' in winning the route, that the
airline's bid was ``just a throwaway application.''
</P>
<P>
   `SCORCHED EARTH APPROACH'
</P>
<P>
   UPS' own campaign marketing materials paint a somewhat
disparaging portrait of its passenger airline competitors. An
entire chapter in one book is devoted to how Delta and American
have not shown ``any commitment to build an Asian network.''
</P>
<P>
   UPS denies that it misrepresented the competition to lawmakers.
``One of the things that occurs in these environments is people
misinterpret,'' Segal said. ``We didn't discount anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding in their own document filed with the DOT, Delta said
that ``UPS has submitted a library of exhibits in a futile effort
to obscure the critical weaknesses of its proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   The lobbying around the China route has been ``extremely
frustrating,'' Yohe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a scorched earth kind of approach,'' Yohe said.
``They decided they had to pull out all the stops. ``
</P>
<P>
   Delta's own economic study of the flight route found that it
would generate $622 million for the nation, $20 million for the
city of Atlanta alone. Last year Delta grabbed an opportunity to
work with China Southern, a Chinese company, to put its passengers
on its planes.
</P>
<P>
   Delta is proposing daily service from New York's John F. Kennedy
International Airport to Beijing with continuing single-plane
service from Beijing to Shanghai. All flights would originate and
terminate in Atlanta, the airline's primary hub. In addition, Delta
would offer nonstop service three times per week between Portland,
Ore., and Beijing with continuing single-plane service to Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   Polar Air's Montgomery said UPS' lobbying prompted calls to him
from legislators. ``We received calls from the Hill asking if we,
too, were applying because UPS apparently said they were the sole
cargo applicant,'' Montgomery said. ``They invited us to explain
our position.''
</P>
<P>
   QUESTIONING METHODS
</P>
<P>
   The rivals for the air route aren't the only ones questioning
UPS' methods.
</P>
<P>
   FedEx takes exception with the way UPS portrays the company as
having a monopoly on direct cargo flights to China. UPS delivers to
China through a Chinese carrier.
</P>
<P>
   FedEx has been flying its packages directly to China since 1995,
when it bought Evergreen International Aviation Inc., the only
airliner allowed to fly cargo to China.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a competitive advantage based on a smart decision we
made years ago,'' said Greg Rossiter, a spokesman for FedEx. ``If
UPS finds itself trailing FedEx and envious of our competitive
advantage and the service we provide, then UPS has only itself to
blame.''
</P>
<P>
   UPS contends that since FedEx is the only cargo hauler to fly
directly to China, it has a monopoly in the direct express delivery
service. It plays that up in its application materials. One chapter
in its materials is entitled: ``FedEx has a Self-Admitted Monopoly
in the Direct Express All-Cargo U.S.-China Market.''
</P>
<P>
   In the chapter, UPS suggests that the lack of competition in
China has driven up the cost of package delivery by as much as 37.3
percent. It also uses FedEx's own Super Bowl commercial to make the
point that FedEx advertises that it is ``the only express shipper
with direct routes from China.''

BATTLING FOR BOYHOOD IN THE LEAGUES OF ABUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Mass.)  By ROBERT LIPSYTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The escalating scuffle that left one suburban hockey dad dead
and another charged with manslaughter last week was no isolated
incident of rink rage gone mad. It was one of the more violent
skirmishes in a battle for boyhood that is spreading across the
fields of play.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when male adolescents have become a hot
psychopolitical topic among feminists and antifeminists, it might
be more useful to examine jock culture's role in boys' lives. The
two fathers, acting out of their own ideas of how best to raise a
boy, probably saw each other as threats not only to their sons but
to images of manhood formed in their own boyhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The last time we looked in on the impact of jock culture on
young people was right after the shooting deaths at Columbine High
School last year. In an earlier version of &UR;  &LR; thelipsite(at)aol.com,
readers were invited to comment on the prevailing wisdom that the
arrogant, entitled behavior of high school athletes, as encouraged
by the parents, teachers and coaches who vicariously live through
their overhyped deeds, created an everlasting divide; we identify
ourselves as jocks (or their camp-followers) and outsiders (geeks,
nerds, greasers, burnouts, etc.)
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail response was overwhelming, thoughtful and sometimes
emotional, mostly from middle-aged men who remembered high school
with still smoldering resentment against jocks. But former athletes
wrote as well. Some of them remembered those years with guilt for
bullying and hazing weaker kids, and with some shame for the way
they had been humiliated by coaches. High school was too late to
begin changing the pattern of abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think peewee leagues,'' says Dr. Michael Miletic, a
Detroit-area psychiatrist who played hockey as a teen-ager in
Canada and now watches his 12-year-old play. ``And it's not just
the elite traveling teams. Even the house league teams become
parents' teams. There are no easy solutions. These psychologists
who tell you to monitor the coaches or pull the kids out are not
realistic. They're certainly not at the rink.''
</P>
<P>
   They are in the bookstores, however, and on the lecture circuit
in a somewhat simplistic frenzy of boy-watching that seems like a
weak imitation of the ground-breaking books of a few years ago on
adolescent females. The most popular is William Pollack's 1998
``Real Boys,'' which describes its subjects as trapped against
their will in the oppression of traditional masculinity.
</P>
<P>
   Of sports, Pollack writes: ``Sheer competition among boys rarely
builds character and does little to bring boys closer to one
another. But sports, when they are play, can be a tremendously good
thing for boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollack's chief rival, Christina Hoff Sommers, offers even less
in this year's ``The War Against Boys,'' which basically describes
them as under siege by feminists who would unman them. Sommers
manages to misinterpret the Glen Ridge (N.J.) rape case; what her
agenda would list as suburban liberal permissiveness was actually
the traditional deification of smalltown football players who were
hollowed out by burdens they couldn't carry.
</P>
<P>
   Adults may be able to escape jock culture if they work at home
or in the arts and avoid television and newspaper sports sections,
but for most adults the harm or the health has already been
bestowed. For boys, however, there is no escaping jock culture. And
the potential for harm may be greater for young athletes.
</P>
<P>
   In Miletic's son's league, as he tells it, there is ``an
overweight, not overbright coach who over and over sends out the
dirtiest teams and no one does anything about it. For the same
reasons the nonabusive spouse allows the kids to be abused. People
are passive and they rationalize. They're in denial, they say:
`It'll stop. It's not so bad. It's a tough world out there and
maybe this will make the boys ready for it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Not all the background details are known of the incident in
suburban Boston other than that the father who killed was demanding
that the other father stop encouraging rough play among the boys.
</P>
<P>
   From a distance, Miletic can spin a sadly common scenario. A
father-coach sends children out to be rough; he stirs their rage,
establishes an opposing team as an enemy and provokes his boys not
just to beat them but to dominate them. How much, asks Miletic, has
this to do with strategy and how much to do with the coach's own
feelings of smallness and submissiveness? How much has this to do
with the way he was traumatized in childhood? And he is
traumatizing another generation who will take it out in bullying
other kids and eventually their own sons and players.
</P>
<P>
   Among Miletic's patients, who include professional athletes, is
a 14-year-old boy who came to him suffering from depression. In the
course of therapy, Miletic learned that the boy had been on a
championship peewee football team in which the boys were abused
after a loss or even a poor practice. Garbage pails were set out on
the field and the boys were made to run around them until they were
hanging over them, vomiting. The boy eventually quit the team, to
his parents' anger and disappointment, but joined his high school
team, where the abuse was somewhat less.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then he broke his arm in practice,'' Miletic said. ``How
convenient. And what relief he felt.''
</P>
<P>
   In the battle for boyhood, the broken arm was a real war's
equivalent of the so-called million-dollar wound that sends you
home.

AFRICA'S AIDS CRISIS: FINDING COMMON GROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: SUBS 18th graf, And Zola Skweyiya ..., to CORRECT, South
Africa never had a white majority; changes `eventually revert to a
white majority' to `end up with a white majority. ' ) 
By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa _ When former South African president
Nelson Mandela issued his forceful call for action to stop the AIDS
epidemic ravaging his country and much of the continent, it was a
great relief to the 12,500 participants at the 13th international
AIDS conference, which ended here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting in the most-infected province of the most-infected
country on the most-infected continent, they were bitterly
disappointed when the current South African president, Thabo Mbeki,
did not acknowledge forthrightly that HIV causes AIDS, emphasizing
instead social factors like poverty as a major force behind the
epidemic. In a way, however, Mandela's call for immediate action
and Mbeki's emphasis on poverty were making similar points.
</P>
<P>
   For while a virus causes AIDS, social conditions feed the
epidemic. Patterns of behavior _ fed by poverty, ignorance and
despair _ have resulted in a disease so widespread that it has left
millions of orphans and threatens to destroy much of Africa's
economy and to wipe out a generation of young people.
</P>
<P>
   But what is implicit in the remarks of both Mbeki and Mandela is
the idea that some AIDS problems can be attacked now, even without
the vaccines and cures that have yet to emerge from laboratories in
the developed world.
</P>
<P>
   Just 10 miles from the plush surroundings of the conference
center, many South Africans live in squatter camps and earn meager
incomes as migrant workers. As they have traveled seeking jobs in
mines and other industries, they have brought HIV home to their
families to fuel what has become an explosive epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela cited two African countries, Uganda and Senegal. The
first turned around a major epidemic of AIDS. The second prevented
a small one from becoming larger. Those successes, using relatively
inexpensive public health tools like education, suggest that other
countries severely affected by HIV might do as well, if they can
only muster the political will to act.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela challenged the world to focus on what health workers
know works in preventing AIDS. Though the use of drugs to prevent
transmission of the virus from mothers to infants is mandatory in
any HIV control plan, Mandela said, ``Promoting abstinence, safe
sex and the use of condoms and ensuring the early treatment of
sexually transmitted diseases are some of the steps needed and
about which there can be no dispute.''
</P>
<P>
   These are steps that could be carried out immediately and at a
relatively low cost.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the conference, other participants stressed similar
steps, the kind of old-fashioned public health work that has shown
good, if not spectacular, results.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Dr. Hoosen M. Coovadia, a leading AIDS expert in
Durban and the conference chairman, cited the way political and
religious leaders from diverse parts of Uganda and Senegal spoke
out about AIDS, both to reduce the stigma of the disease and to
encourage counseling, testing and the aggressive promotion of
condom use.
</P>
<P>
   The results have been encouraging. Uganda's infection rates have
dropped to 8 percent from 14 percent in the early 1990s, according
to U.N. statistics for the most recent years available. Rates in
Senegal, where the country's then-president, Abdou Diouf, began
speaking out forcefully more than a decade ago, have stayed below 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where prostitution is legal, Senegalese health
officials have set up free clinics to treat sexually transmitted
infections, and have organized a vigorous education campaign on the
virus.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela also pointed to Thailand, which acted relatively quickly
to set up an aggressive program to offer condoms and treat sexually
transmitted diseases, which enhance the spread of the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   Thailand was one of the first countries to commit its own
resources to fight the epidemic, said Dr. Helene Gayle, who directs
the HIV program for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC worked with Thailand to set up sophisticated infection
surveillance systems that allowed it to track the path of its
epidemic. Thailand used the systems to respond quickly when it
spotted rising HIV rates in specific areas.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, South Africa, which at the start of the epidemic
had a relatively low infection rate, is now seeking ways to help an
estimated 20 percent of adults infected with the virus. Because few
have access to tests for the virus, most are ignorant of their
condition. And almost none have access to the drugs that have
helped control the infection in richer countries.
</P>
<P>
   The AIDS epidemic is ``depleting health services and robbing
schools of both students and teachers'' as it undermines the
country's economy, Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
   And Zola Skweyiya, the South African minister of welfare and
population development, was quoted in the nation's newspapers as
offering an even more drastic assessment: If the AIDS trend goes
unabated, South Africa could end up with a white majority.
</P>
<P>
   In South Africa, HIV rates rose slowly during apartheid and
surged late in Mandela's presidency and during Mbeki's first year
in office. In the last two years, they have risen by more than 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela acknowledged that HIV flourished when it could have been
prevented. Now, he said he is instructing his private foundation to
consult experts about the best way to conduct anti-HIV campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Though the meeting was held in Africa to encourage the world's
AIDS experts and government leaders to focus on the dire conditions
here, participants looked beyond the continent, repeatedly calling
on leaders of countries elsewhere to show the political will to
beat AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   They cited the rapidly worsening epidemic of HIV in Russia and
voiced particular concern about the threat to the world's most
populous countries, India and China.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the emphasis on public health efforts stems from the
belief that the drugs that have greatly improved life for AIDS
patients in the developed world are out of reach of the third
world's poor.
</P>
<P>
   But UNAIDS, a joint U.N. agency, and five drug companies are
negotiating steep drops in the price of AIDS drugs for Africa and
other poor regions afflicted by the disease. For example, the
German company Behringer-Ingelheim announced that it would offer an
anti-HIV drug, nevirapine, free for five years for the prevention
of mother-to-child transmission in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   Still, health officials at the conference stressed that lowering
prices is only part of the battle. For example, the combination
drug therapies used extensively in rich countries require testing
for HIV, measuring the level of the virus in the blood, and
preventing and dealing with the complications that often occur with
such therapy _ much of which is beyond the health care
infrastructure in the third world.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stefan Vella, the president of the group that organizes the
AIDS conferences, warned of ``the dangers of parachuting drugs''
into countries that have no health infrastructure because ``you may
do more harm than good.''
</P>
<P>
   In education efforts about the basic facts of AIDS, a major goal
will be to destroy widespread myths in Africa. One is that having
sex with a virgin will cure AIDS, a belief that often leads to
violence and rape, said Dr. Zweli Mkhize, the health minister of
KwaZulu/Natal province.
</P>
<P>
   But the educational programs will not be effective unless they
focus on men, said Dr. William M. Makgoba, the head of the South
African equivalent of the U.S. National Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always target young females,'' Makgoba said. Instead, he
urged, efforts must be made to educate men about how risky sexual
practices spread the virus and that, overall, men have done more
than women to spread the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Coovadia said that the meeting he led provided a range of
options for governments to make decisions about how to combat AIDS,
but that it was up to them to carry out those policies.
</P>
<P>
   That will not be easy. ``Anybody who claims they have a simple
solution for such a complex problem is either naive or a liar,''
said Dr. Peter Piot, the director of UNAIDS.

ABSENT TYSON   HAS PRESENCE   IN TITLE BOUT
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Mike Tyson isn't even here. He's reportedly in Phoenix,
his latest home in a long line of addresses from Brooklyn to
upstate New York correctional facilities to Catskill, N.Y., to Ohio
to an Indiana prison to Connecticut to Las Vegas to Maryland. But
he's still hovering over Saturday night's Lennox Lewis-Frans Botha
heavyweight title fight at the London Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Lewis has a mandatory title defense scheduled
against David Tua of New Zealand in November (possibly in Toronto),
the champion has acknowledged that Tyson might be a future
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted Frank Bruno, once Britain's heavyweight pride who
is still more popular than Lewis, to warn Lewis that he ``better
watch out'' for the former heavyweight champion who leveled Lou
Savarese in 38 seconds three weeks ago in Glasgow, Scotland. And
that provoked Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is this guy talking about?'' Lewis has been saying.
``This is the same geezer who turned into a statue in the ring
against Tyson. And he's telling me to watch out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not go in there and fight Tyson the way he did and go
in looking the way he did beforehand, when he kept making signs of
the cross. I don't think that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson dethroned Bruno as the WBC heavyweight champion in the
British boxer's first defense of that title in 1996. The
Jamaica-born Bruno had won the WBC title from Oliver McCall, the
only conqueror of Lewis going into Saturday night's bout.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Lewis, then an undefeated young heavyweight on the
rise, stopped Bruno in the seventh round at Wembley.
</P>
<P>
   Botha, briefly the IBF champion in 1995, would also like to
fight Tyson _ his conqueror in a one-punch fifth-round knockout 18
months ago in Las Vegas after the South African dominated the first
four rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a mismatch while it lasted, but I got cocky,'' Botha
recalled. ``I started fooling around, dropping my hands, talking to
him. I tasted victory too soon. I lost focus and paid dearly for
the mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Botha's new trainer, Abel Sanchez, once the sculptor of junior
middleweight champion Terry Norris, touted Botha's new attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frans phoned me after the Tyson fight and asked me to work
with him at my Big Bear camp in California,'' Sanchez said. ``I
called other people in boxing and they told me he was hardheaded,
that he wouldn't do what you tell him, that he talked back to his
trainers, but I haven't had a peep out of him. He's stronger with
more stamina now and that's made it easy to work him harder.''
</P>
<P>
   But no matter where or when Lewis or Botha fight Tyson, it's
doubtful if the bout would be anywhere in Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson is more persona non grata than ever in Britain following
two farcical appearances _ a second-round knockout of the
incompetent Julius Francis in London earlier this year and the
ridiculously quick knockout of Savarese when he pushed the referee
to the canvas and later snarled on television that he wanted to
``rip out'' Lewis' heart and ``eat'' the champion's children.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, Lewis, still a bachelor at 35, has no children.
</P>
<P>
   For all of Tyson's talk about wanting to fight Lewis, he also
acknowledged that he was ``not ready'' for a title bout, that he
needed two or three more fights to sharpen his punches. His next
opponent is expected to be Andrew Golota, the Polish heavyweight
with a history of below-the-belt punches _ the perfect lighted
match to toss into the Tyson powder keg.

WHEN SUN GOES AWAY, THE BIG STRIPERS PLAY  

</HEADLINE>
   By NELSON BRYANT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AQUINNAH, Mass. _ Huge shoals of frantic sand eels crowded
against the beach in an effort to escape the striped bass, bluefish
and hickory shad that were slashing through their ranks. The
pursuit was so intense that scores of the small, slender baitfish
were driven onto the strand.
</P>
<P>
   Sunset was an hour away and a gentle southwest breeze was at our
backs as we cast over the barely ruffled waters of Vineyard Sound
off Lobsterville Beach.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the bluefish and the shad provided most of the action.
The bluefish fought harder, but the shad were more spectacular,
flinging themselves out of the water and more than half the time
shaking free of the hook. Hickory shad have been showing up in the
waters surrounding Martha's Vineyard the past few years and have
frequently entered the island's salt ponds.
</P>
<P>
   A half-hour after the sun slid into the sea, we began to catch
stripers consistently. For about an hour, most of those fish were
about 20 inches long, far below the state's current 30-inch minimum
length for the species. (The daily bag limit is one fish, but one
may catch and release as many as one wishes.)
</P>
<P>
   With darkness, big bass arrived, and before long we had caught
several of them, including one 36 inches long. John Lehne of Los
Angeles and Tim Stocco of Brooklyn were with me. Tim and I were fly
fishing; John was using spinning gear.
</P>
<P>
   It seems clear that, in some Vineyard waters at least, striped
bass, and large ones, are more numerous than they have been in a
decade. On five successive nights with different companions, I
caught at least one keeper and six or seven smaller bass. By
contrast, my angling notes reveal that for the previous 10 years in
the same area while fly fishing from shore, I had to catch and
release nearly 150 stripers to get one that was big enough to take
home.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent evening with John Houlihan of Claremont, N.H., and
my son Jeff, there was a period from about 10 to 10:30 when every
cast I made resulted in a strike or a hooked fish. Houlihan and
Jeff, both fly fishermen, had similar good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest winds prevailed throughout these angling adventures,
making conditions excellent for fly fishers. Each late afternoon
when we arrived, we saw diving terns, sand eels flopping on the
strand, and shad, bluefish and stripers breaking water along more
than a half-mile of beach. On one foray, summer flounder, or fluke,
added to the action, hitting any fly that got close to the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Houlihan was almost content. He had caught many medium-sized
bass on our first night together, but lamented that he had yet to
take a keeper on a fly rod. On his second sortie, Houlihan caught
several bass, including two keepers.
</P>
<P>
   For those interested, we took the bass on a variety of flies
that had two things in common, being slender and sparsely tied.
From two to four inches long, they had greenish-white or silver
bodies and were intended to approximate the sand eels on which the
stripers were gorging.
</P>
<P>
   My own favorite fly has two hooks, a silver, tubular body of
Corsair, and a little bunch of blue bucktail on top, just behind
the eye of the front hook. For a tail on the rear hook, I use polar
bear hair from a small batch of it that a visiting Canadian
biologist gave me several years ago. Such hair has a sheen that
ordinary bucktail lacks. The stripers may not notice the
difference, but I do. The hooks on this fly are small, No. 2 up
front, No. 4 in the rear.
</P>
<P>
   I link the hooks with a short piece of 40-pound-test
monofilament that runs inside the Corsair tubing. The monofilament,
held in place by the fly-tying thread, will not slip if a little
bulb is formed on each end of it with a cigarette lighter flame.
Putting a tail hook on a fly is a bit of a bother, but it helps to
hook fish that are striking short. The entire fly is four inches
long.
</P>
<P>
   I use this fly on a floating line when fishing in eight feet of
water or less and usually have my best luck with an extremely slow
retrieve. Indeed, I often hook up with a striper when I have
stopped retrieving, letting whatever current there is give movement
to the fly.
</P>
<P>
   After-dark fly fishing for striped bass has certain challenges,
including training yourself to stash various key items _
flashlight, pliers for removing deeply imbedded hooks, knife,
leader material, leader cutters and flies _ in the same location on
your person, night after night. If you don't do this, it's
astonishing how soon you are enveloped in chaos.
</P>
<P>
   It also helps to establish a ritual for releasing fish. If the
striper is small, you can hold it by its lower lip with one hand
and remove the hook with the other. My own approach with larger
fish is to slide them up the beach beyond the reach of the waves. I
then kneel, remove my beret and place it on the beach as a
sand-free resting place for my reel, get out my pliers and prise
the fly from the fish, which is usually back in the water in a
minute or less.
</P>
<P>
   I was so emboldened by June's superb striper fishing that I told
some weekend house guests _ Susan and Joel Goldstein of Manhattan _
that if they wanted a striper to take back to the city, I would
catch it.
</P>
<P>
   Given the go-ahead, I sallied forth at dusk. On my first cast I
hooked a good fish that went deep into the backing. Beached, it
proved to be a half-inch shy of the legal limit. Three hours later,
I quit, having caught and released a dozen more bass, all smaller
than the first.
</P>
<P>
   My first striper the following evening, after 20 minutes of
casting, was about 28 inches long. At midnight I was still without
a keeper. Waves driven by a strong southwest wind were getting
heavier, and my casting was becoming ragged. I moved a half-mile to
the west.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three casts and I quit,'' I told myself.
</P>
<P>
   The final of those three casts produced a 31-inch female, and
scaled, gutted, partly frozen and wrapped in layers of newspaper,
she was on her way to Manhattan the next morning.

SPORTS COLUMN: REYNOLDS MAKES STARS FLY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Ga., Australia)  By HERB McCORMICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In this quadrennial year of elections and an Olympiad, there are
constants in the air. Politicians and athletes alike will chase
long-held dreams of cheers and glory. Great swatches of television
time will be devoted to outcomes both foregone and unpredictable.
And, for the fourth consecutive running of the Summer Olympics, the
Star class sailor Mark Reynolds will be prospecting for gold.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to Stars, literally and figuratively, the
44-year-old Reynolds knows the ropes. To the native of San Diego,
Star boats have been a common thread in the fabric of his
existence. His father, Jim, who crewed for local Star legends like
Malin Burnham and Dennis Conner, dragged his son to his first
regatta, up the road off Newport Beach, when he was 4. Jim Reynolds
was a fine sailor, but his boy would be the one to make history.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Reynolds grew up with a tiller in one hand, a mainsheet in
the other. He started like many junior sailors, with a string of
one-design sailboats: Sabots, Lasers, a Flying Dutchman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, in the early '80s,'' he said in an interview last week,
``I got serious with Stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Did he ever. In the years that followed, Reynolds roamed the
world collecting passport stamps and Star class sailing medals. He
nabbed a gold medal at the Goodwill Games in Estonia in 1986, and
followed that up with a silver at the Olympics in Pusan, South
Korea, in 1988. Then, in Barcelona, Spain, in 1992, Reynolds won
Olympic gold.
</P>
<P>
   In Savannah, Ga., the Olympic sailing venue in 1996, Reynolds
posted a rare, substandard performance, and finished eighth. But
now he's back, with a new crewman _ 46-year-old Magnus Liljedahl, a
native Swede who gained his American citizenship in the early '90s,
and who has replaced Reynolds' longtime partner, Hal Haenel _ and
he appears stronger than ever.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Reynolds and Liljedahl breezed to victory in the
Olympic trials off San Francisco, winning nine of 14 races. The
pair followed that up with a resounding triumph while vanquishing
111 other crews in the Star World Championships, in May, on the
Chesapeake Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``As it worked out we had a little extra speed edge on
everybody,'' Reynolds said. ``It's been a really good year so
far.''
</P>
<P>
   The Star, a hard-chined, 22-foot-8-inch keel boat, has an all-up
weight of just under 1,500 pounds _ 900 of which are stashed low in
its ballast bulb. It also features a massive mainsail that propels
it beautifully in light wind, which is one of the reasons the boat
has been so popular in San Diego, where other Star luminaries such
as Lowell North, Gerry Driscoll, and Vince Brun have also reigned.
But with its size, the mainsail can be a handful in heavier air.
</P>
<P>
   To counterbalance that big main requires beef, and the
relatively compact, circular Liljedahl, at 6-foot-1 and 255 pounds,
fills the bill. He is also the perfect complement to the more
angular, 6-foot-3, 200-pound Reynolds. In silhouette, the pair
could be mistaken for the wide receiver Jerry Rice and the nose
tackle Jerry Ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a big guy hanging out and getting his weight out as far
as he physically can will help keep the boat more upright and going
fast through the water,'' Reynolds said. ``The harder you hike, the
faster you go.''
</P>
<P>
   If Reynolds is the current embodiment of the quintessential Star
sailor, it's also because, by profession, he's a sailmaker whose
business is crafting the aerodynamic wings on which the fastest
Stars fly. But that also means he is sometimes in the unenviable
position of sharing the equivalent of state secrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you find a little edge you don't want to tell people
about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But one reason people buy my sails is because they get my
advice on how to set them up,'' he continued. ``The only way I can
afford to keep sailing is by selling good sails. If I started
hiding stuff, it'd shut me down.''
</P>
<P>
   In the coming Olympics in Sydney, Australia, Reynolds will not
be contending with a 100-plus-boat fleet, as he did at the world
championships. The Olympic Star class quota is only 18 boats, but
it is a highly competitive field that includes the Canadian Ross
MacDonald; the hometown favorite, Australia's own, Colin Beashel;
and the Brazilian Torben Grael, back to Stars after his stint
aboard Prada in the last America's Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of depth there,'' Reynolds said. ``Beashel's
been consistent for years and he came real close to winning the
gold last time. MacDonald's a great sailor, and Grael has a new
boat with a little different hull shape so it's possible that could
give him a little edge.''
</P>
<P>
   But Reynolds, on his accustomed mission in an Olympic year,
likes his chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been going well,'' he said. ``Barring any catastrophes I
think we have a good shot at winning an Olympic medal. We're aiming
for the gold one.''

VOTER FATIGUE AND A NEW CAST CREATE A LULL, AND NEITHER CAMPAIGN
MINDS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the last year, perhaps the best place to measure
the frenzy that was the New York Senate race was in the cramped,
cluttered press office for Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign.
There, across the street from Madison Square Garden, Clinton's
aides fielded hundreds of inquiries from around the globe every
day, all the while directing assaults on Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and
responding to incoming attacks.
</P>
<P>
   But the other day, a hot and languid weekday July afternoon, the
scene on Seventh Avenue was almost tranquil. The phones were
relatively silent. Howard Wolfson, Clinton's driven press
secretary, who would normally be juggling at least two telephone
calls and three e-mail exchanges at once, even found a free moment
to search through baseball rotisserie-league sites on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, New York still has a Senate race, and it still features a
sitting first lady of the United States. But that has often become
increasingly difficult to detect on many days in recent weeks, as
aides to Clinton and her Republican opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio, have
come to discover.
</P>
<P>
   A fog has descended over this once highest of high-flying
campaigns, leaving the candidates' advisers discussing what to do
about it _ if anything, because it remains a matter of debate in
both campaigns whether all this attention was ever a good thing for
either candidate.
</P>
<P>
   If aides to Lazio and Clinton agree on anything, it is that
voters (and, not incidentally, other politicians and the news
media) have lost, at least for the time being, some of their
fascination with a contest that for so long had seemed the
political equivalent of the O.J. Simpson trial.
</P>
<P>
   And who can blame them?
</P>
<P>
   First, and most obviously, with Giuliani gone, this race is very
different from what it was just a few weeks ago. If Giuliani was
brash, cunning, sometimes intemperate and almost always
interesting, Lazio is cautious and tentative, heeding campaign
advisers who have urged that he learn the lay of the land and avoid
the provocative statements that Giuliani relished. That makes the
candidate Lazio less like Giuliani and more like _ well, Clinton,
with the not surprising result that comes from having two
candidates intent on avoiding controversy.
</P>
<P>
   But the new cast of this contest is only part of it. New Yorkers
have been drowning in politicking for what seems like years now.
Aides to Clinton and Lazio suspect that a fatigue has crept over an
electorate that can be forgiven for feeling oversaturated.
</P>
<P>
   This campaign for the Senate started almost as soon as the last
one ended, in November 1998, when Daniel Patrick Moynihan announced
he would not seek re-election. Clinton has been talking and
listening her way across New York since last July. Vice President
Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush have been making daily policy
pronouncements and attacks from the moment each emerged as his
party's presumptive presidential nominee last March. The Senate
race in New Jersey, one of that state's most combative and closely
watched campaigns in decades, has thrown a few more voices into the
political din, at least in the New York metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't help that there are only so many issues to go around,
and it does seem as if Clinton, Gore, Lazio and Bush are reading
off the findings of the same focus groups. Can anyone be faulted
for losing track of whether it is Clinton or Gore who is denouncing
the ``risky'' Republican Social Security or tax plan, or whether it
is Bush or Lazio blaming the Clinton administration for soaring
fuel costs or high taxes?
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with the campaigns is that they started so long
ago,'' Steve Gold, 49, who was eating lunch outdoors at Bryant Park
the other afternoon, said dismissively.
</P>
<P>
   Kirsten Henri, a 24-year-old writer from Chelsea, put it a
little more pungently. ``The campaign,'' she said, ``is boring.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As Wolfson discovered, press phone calls to both campaigns are,
generally speaking, markedly down. So are the requests to the
campaigns for guests for the Sunday morning network talk shows,
which once paid nearly as much attention to the New York Senate
race as they did to the presidential contest. Clinton's campaign
events, while still unwieldy by the standards of a normal New York
state race, no longer have the overwhelming feeling of a full-scale
spectacle, with chattering television crews from across the world
competing with Washington-based network correspondents for a
question to the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Although the candidates have been talking _ Clinton has some
sort of event almost every day _ there is little evidence that the
voters are listening. In a poll by Quinnipiac University released
on June 7, Clinton and Lazio were tied, 44 percent to 44 percent.
Two weeks ago, after a month in which Clinton had been attacking
Lazio for one thing or another almost every day, in speeches and
with television advertisements, another Quinnipiac Poll was
released. The result? Clinton and Lazio are tied, 45 percent to 45
percent.
</P>
<P>
   At Jones Beach on Long Island the other day, the mere mention of
what was once viewed as the race of the century drew long stares
and yawns from people who had obviously found a better way to pass
a hot July afternoon. ``It's, like, summertime,'' said John Cooper,
23, of Wheatly Heights. ``People are not interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Up the beach, Colleen McGrath, 39, from Nesconset, seconded that
sentiment as she kept an eye on her two children. ``It gets played
out after a while,'' she said. ``After a while, you don't want to
hear it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   What has happened, really, is that the race for Senate in New
York is becoming normal. This is the way it is supposed to be.
Summer time is hibernation time in most campaigns, which candidates
use to raise money and try out their fall campaign themes,
preferably without too much attention.
</P>
<P>
   In the race for president, Bush and Gore both decided to
campaign as if Election Day were a week away as soon as each
effectively grasped the nomination, and not risk ceding the stage
to his opponent. But Clinton and Giuliani made no such choice: They
could not escape public attention if they tried, and they did try,
concerned from the start that too much attention was not good for
two candidates who were so polarizing.
</P>
<P>
   It is, of course, the departure of Giuliani _ and the entrance
of what many Republicans have concluded is the more politically
conventional and less dynamic Lazio _ that more than anything
accounts for the quick and dramatic shift of tone.
</P>
<P>
   Part of this reflects what Lazio is. As a member of Congress
from Suffolk County, as opposed to the chief executive of the
nation's premier city, Lazio does not have the captive press corps
or City Hall platform that Giuliani used to drive coverage of the
Senate race. Lazio, by contrast, spent much of last week 300 miles
away from New York: in Washington, casting little-noticed votes in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But much of this change is a direct reflection of the style and
relative experience of the man who entered the race after
Giuliani's diagnosis of prostate cancer. One Republican leader,
after nervously commenting about Lazio's sometimes rocky entrance
onto the Senate campaign stage, suggested that Lazio, who has never
before run for statewide office, could benefit from a little more
practice and a little less attention.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's advisers disagree with that assessment of the
candidate's skills, though they do seem to be taking that advice.
Mike Murphy, Lazio's senior strategist, said that the lull played
to Lazio's benefit. ``The Lazio campaign is very happy with the
current tempo of the campaign,'' he said. ``Mrs. Clinton is slowly
sinking, and Lazio is slowly coming up. I don't think the media is
hyperventilating any more.''
</P>
<P>
   At Clinton's headquarters, even Wolfson sounded a bit relieved.
``I think it's fine that it no longer feels that the whole world is
watching,'' he said. ``It feels more like a normal Senate
campaign.'' After all, if Lazio and Clinton kept going at it the
way Clinton and Giuliani had, what on earth could be left to say
after Labor Day, once the campaign really starts?

 &HT;    FIVE HOLES WORTH WATCHING
 &HT;    by Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ There are two ways to play St. Andrews,
the way the pros play and the way golf writer Glenn Sheeley (9
handicap) played it.
</P>
<P>
   AT THE OLD COURSE, ST. ANDREWS:
</P>
<P>
   No. 1
</P>
<P>
   376 yards, par 4
</P>
<P>
   How the pros play it: Anybody who misses this fairway might not
be around for the weekend. Like the 18th, which runs beside it,
this hole is wide enough to catch even the most errant drive. A
fairway wood or long iron sets up the second shot, which is the
real key. The approach must carry the 6-foot wide Swilcan Burn,
which snakes in front of a green that slopes toward the water. When
the wind blows, which is almost always, shots with too much air
under them are knocked down easily. A pitch played too firmly can
bring an uneasy, downhill putt.
</P>
<P>
   How I played it: With the rain coming sideways and the wind
blowing hard, I semi-shanked a driver but got plenty of roll. My
7-iron second shot got caught in the wind and ended up on the right
fringe but stayed dry, except for the raindrops, of course. I
chipped up to 15 feet and two-putted for bogey.
</P>
<P>
   No. 8
</P>
<P>
   175 yards, par 3
</P>
<P>
   How the pros play it: Depending on the wind, this par 3, the
only one on the front side, to a giant shared green, can be
anything from a 9-iron to a 5-iron. The pin often is hidden by a
ridge of rough grass that runs across the face of the green,
allowing only the top half of the flag to be seen from the teebox.
</P>
<P>
   How I played it: With the hole playing 166 and the weather
suddenly dry and mild, I blocked a 7-iron so far right that I
actually was closer to the 10th green's flagstick, 108 feet away
from the correct one _ no joke; we walked it off. Wondering if
putter was enough club, I somehow hit the approach putt to eight
feet and sank the remainder for par, receiving a high-five as if I
had made birdie.
</P>
<P>
   No. 9
</P>
<P>
   352 yards, par 4
</P>
<P>
   How the pros play it: Definitely a reachable par 4 for many,
especially downwind, but two small bunkers must be avoided in the
final 70 yards to the hole. From the area in front of the green,
putting often is the best option.
</P>
<P>
   How I played it: With the hole listed at 307 yards and playing
shorter on firm and fast ground, my drive was about 15 yards off
the front of the green. Putting over the mounds and dips, I stroked
the ball against the flagstick and dropped it from about 45 feet
for eagle.
</P>
<P>
   No. 17
</P>
<P>
   455 yards, par 4
</P>
<P>
   How the pros play it: The ideal path on the famous Road Hole is
a blind driver over a corner of the Old Course Hotel, just over the
capital ``O,'' to hit the fairway and avoid the deep rough on the
left. The safe approach is to the right side of the green, avoiding
an area left that funnels into the steep-faced Road Bunker. Hit
right and onto the gravel road _ or worse, against the stone wall _
and anything is possible.
</P>
<P>
   How I played it: Not my proudest moment. Going for the bold
route, I came out of my drive on the downswing and flared a ball
out of bounds right, hitting the Old Course Hotel. Fortunately,
it's still standing, and, actually, it happens all the time. After
a reload drive that wound up in the left rough, I hit 5-iron out to
the fairway. Pitching to 10 feet, I missed the putt and wrote down
a 7.
</P>
<P>
   No. 18
</P>
<P>
   357 yards, par 4
</P>
<P>
   How the pros play it: Facing another huge fairway that is hard
to miss, a driver here can reach the green, too, depending on the
wind and the firmness of the ground. It's out of bounds right if
someone really blocks one beyond the posts that separate the course
from the town. Key to the approach is avoiding the deep Valley of
Sin on the left of the green's front.
</P>
<P>
   How I played it: Decent drive up the middle with darkness
approaching. Hit an 8-iron and the ball trickled down toward the
Valley of Sin. With darkness approaching, I three-putted from about
45 feet for bogey, and I wasn't all that disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   TEE TO GREEN
</P>
<P>
   The repositioning of six championship tees at St. Andrews for
the 2000 Open has increased the overall yardage from 6,933 yards to
7,115.

 &HT;    Woods approaching Grand Slam history
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ The odds are favorable for improvement
from Tigers Woods' last British Open at the Old Course in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, then a 19-year-old U.S. Amateur champion who had
immeasurable raw talent but little course management, tied for 68th
on rounds of 74-71-72-78. He was 13 shots behind winner John Daly.
</P>
<P>
   If Woods won by 13 shots this week, few people would be shocked.
Not after his mind-boggling 15-stroke win in the U.S. Open. Not
when, at 24, he is going for the career Grand Slam, poised to join
Jack Nicklaus, Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan and Gary Player as winners
of all four major championships. Not when two of his three majors
wins, with the 12-shot blowout at Augusta in 1997, have been routs.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two years, Woods has demonstrated a scary ability
to strike every possible type of shot he chooses. Once wild, Woods'
swing has become grooved and his distances controlled. The result
has been a staggering 15 wins in his last 26 starts.
</P>
<P>
   Pebble Beach was a familiar course that suited Woods well, and
St. Andrews, with its open property and his ability to blow the
ball over bunkers, is even more ideal. He shot 66 twice there in
the 1998 Dunhill Cup, when his game was not nearly this polished.
</P>
<P>
   If Woods' putter is on form, he should win.
</P>
<P>
   Long before Woods pillaged Pebble Beach, former Royal and
Ancient Golf Club secretary Michael Bonallack suggested ``a
steward's inquiry'' if he doesn't prevail at the Old Course.
</P>
<P>
   Keen on history and the place he quickly has taken in it, Woods
will be as motivated to make it happen this week as he seemed
uninterested two weeks ago in the Western Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every person who has ever played the game of golf has wanted
to win an Open Championship (at St. Andrews),'' Woods said last
week in Ireland, where he won a charity event as a warmup for the
Old Course. ``It would mean everything to me, and I'd say I have a
good chance. To have the opportunity to complete the (career) Grand
Slam at the course where it all started is very symbolic.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods tied for third at Royal Birkdale in 1998, when his
tightened swing was still a work-in-progress, and he was 7th last
year at Carnoustie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything depends on the weather,'' Woods said. ``I'm just
hoping the wind blows a little bit, to make it a test. Then the
person driving it well is going to have the greatest advantage. . .
. If it's calm and warm, like it was when Nick (Faldo) won in 1990,
then (the Old Course) is not very hard _ pretty easy, in fact. But
when it blows, it becomes brutally hard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Golf has a habit of biting people when they least expect it,''
said Peter Dawson, the R&AMP;A secretary. ``Tiger is clearly the best
in the world, but it doesn't mean he's going to win every time.''

 &HT;    A return to the Old Course
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ A year ago, the world's finest players
were ready to set fire to Carnoustie's knee-high rough and spit on
its narrowed fairways.
</P>
<P>
   This week, they come home to St. Andrews, and all is right with
the world. In comparison, the Old Course is an Old Friend.
</P>
<P>
   Last year was a torture test to be forgotten. This is a history
lesson to savor. After the Shadow of Death, heck, what's a little
Valley of Sin?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe even Jean Van de Velde, the tragic figure of Car-nasty,
can go a week without slipping off his cleats. Situated about 7,000
miles east of Pebble Beach, golf's third major of 2000 arrives at
the home of golf, St. Andrews, for the 129th British Open.
</P>
<P>
   A Hell Bunker and a heavenly scenario: Tiger Woods, 24, after
winning by 15 strokes in last month's U.S. Open, attempts to become
the youngest player in history to complete the career Grand Slam.
</P>
<P>
   As always in Scotland, the elements will play a large role. It
might have been a smile crossing Woods' face when he stepped out of
a helicopter last week in Limerick, Ireland, for a charity event
and noticed winds gusting as much as 40 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all depends if the wind blows or not,'' Woods said. ``If
the wind blows, I'll have a bigger advantage than when it doesn't
blow. If it's calm, anybody can go low there. That golf course is
going to be torn apart if it's calm.''
</P>
<P>
   While it's been mostly cold, windy and rainy for the last couple
of weeks in Scotland, the rough at the Old Course is plenty sparse
compared with Carnoustie. Perhaps only three inches deep, except
for a few places on the seaside links property, it is quite a
contrast from last year, when drives missing the fairway almost
eliminated pars.
</P>
<P>
   The Old Course is not about length. Several par 4s can be
reached from the teebox by many players, not just Woods. When the
most famous piece of land in golf is bordered by ocean and a town,
the course can be extended only so far.
</P>
<P>
   Some length has been added for the Open, with six tees
repositioned to increase the yardage from 6,933 yards to 7,115 and
to bring into play some old hazards and bunkers that have been
flown over by today's big hitters. But the Old Course's only
consistent defenses are weather, bunkers so deep that the only exit
is sometimes backwards and elevated greens with giant dips and
swales.
</P>
<P>
   To protect St. Andrews' precious sand-based turf, fans playing
there in recent months have been required to carry along a piece of
Astroturf to place on the fairway at their ball.
</P>
<P>
   Because the ground is so firm, the greens often must be reached
with the ground game. If the wind howls, you'll see balls scooting
across greens, in and out of swales, more like pingpong balls.
</P>
<P>
   In a perfect world, course officials would want St. Andrews to
force shots such as some of the bounding beauties Sergio Garcia
made in the most recent Dunhill Cup, shots that bounced 80 to 100
yards to the putting surface.
</P>
<P>
   It's a course that the long hitters will overpower if enough
holes aren't against the wind. Woods could be facing frequent eagle
putts on a par 4.
</P>
<P>
   All 112 bunkers on the Old Course have been retooled for the
Open Championship. In an effort to protect the course's three
largest bunkers _ Cottage at the 4th, Shell at the 7th and Hell
Bunker at the 14th _ railroad ties have been set vertically in
concrete to form a face against which layers of turf are stacked.
</P>
<P>
   The Old Course is a bomber's paradise, provided you know which
spire to aim for in the distance, but it requires a bit of luck to
miss the key bunkers. Much of the trouble at St. Andrews is on the
right side, but often an approach from the safer left side presents
a poor angle to the green. Dead center drives, unless placed in
orbit, can find nasty pot bunkers unseen from the teebox.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to drive the ball well there,'' said Nick Price,
who won at Turnberry in 1994. ``St. Andrews is a good driving golf
course. People think it's wide open. It's not as wide open as you'd
think. . . . If you don't get the right line into the green, many
times you can't get even a pitching wedge closer than 30 feet from
the hole.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Andrews can be far more unpredictable than Pebble Beach,
largely because of the uneven ground and the greens' funky nature.
</P>
<P>
   But it might be just wishful thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think St. Andrews will help the rest of us,'' said Nick
Faldo, who won here in 1990 under warm, dry conditions. ``It's a
true links course, with big greens, and you can play it with no
real scare.''

U.S. SEEKS COMEBACK AT MIDDLE DISTANCES
</HEADLINE>
  By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Although he ran no farther than one lap
around the track, Michael Johnson accounted for America's only
medal at any distance longer than a full-out sprint at the 1996
Olympics in Atlanta. There is renewed hope for the middle distances
at the 2000 Games in Sydney, Australia, where the United States
could not only win a medal in the women's 1,500 meters but also win
even a gold.
</P>
<P>
   Regina Jacobs, a two-time silver medalist at the world
championships, and Suzy Favor Hamilton, only the second U.S. woman
to breach four minutes in the 1,500, will face off Sunday at that
distance in the Olympic track and field trials. While championship
races are often tactical and slow, Tom Craig, who is Jacobs' coach
and husband, believes Mary Slaney's 17-year-old U.S. record of 3
minutes 57.12 seconds could be in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Suzy takes it seriously and goes out like she did at
Prefontaine, it's going to be a very fast race,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   On June 24 at the Prefontaine Classic in Eugene, Ore., Favor
Hamilton ran a searing pace against Gabriela Szabo of Romania, the
1996 Olympic silver medalist, building a 20-meter lead only to be
caught at the tape as she stumbled to the track. Szabo's time of
4:00.73 is the fastest time in the world this year, and Favor
Hamilton's 4:00.79 is second fastest. Until Friday's victory in the
preliminaries in 4:06:16, Jacobs had not run a 1,500 meters
outdoors this season, but at the Prefontaine meet she set a
personal best of 1:58.08 at 800 meters.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. women have never won a medal at 1,500 meters since it was
added to the Olympic program at the 1972 Games in Munich, Germany.
The event has been dominated by runners from the former Soviet
Union, and the current Olympic champion, Svetlana Masterkova, is
also from Russia. However, Masterkova has undergone a pair of
surgeries on her Achilles' tendons and remains an unknown commodity
with the Olympics 2 1/2 months away. Previously she said she would
skip the European circuit before Sydney, although she will
apparently emerge at a meet in Oslo later this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally think they are having a real problem with her
coming back,'' Craig said recently of Masterkova. ``It wasn't one
Achilles, it was both.''
</P>
<P>
   Szabo will run the 5,000 in Sydney and may double in the 1,500.
But Jacobs and Favor Hamilton are clearly threats to win the gold
medal. Both are at the top of their games after suffering
career-altering traumas _ Jacobs overcoming a severe iron
deficiency and Favor Hamilton having gained a new resolve after the
suicide last year of her brother, who suffered from manic
depression.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Wisconsin, Favor Hamilton won nine
collegiate titles. She has made two previous Olympic teams and only
Slaney has surpassed her own personal best of 3:58.43 among U.S.
women. But Favor Hamilton, who is 31, has also had a reputation as
a soft, timid runner who was not fortified athletically or mentally
to contend in major races.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   She missed last season after undergoing surgery to repair a torn
Achilles' tendon, and on Sept. 9 her brother Dan, an artist who had
stopped taking his anti-depressant medication, killed himself. His
sister has begun using her maiden name again to honor Dan Favor,
and she has spoken frequently about her brother's death in hopes of
raising awareness about manic depression. She races now to honor
her brother, Favor Hamilton said, and she has developed a new
urgency and fearlessness in her running, as well as a new affinity
for distance training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel rejuvenated and motivated,'' Favor Hamilton said after
winning her preliminary heat in 4:10.29 Friday night. ``I'm a new
runner. Every race is a gift. I want to give it my all. People say
it's dangerous and you can overdo it. But I want to do something
amazing for my brother, myself, my family. My brother's death has
motivated me. It's funny how tragedy can turn a life around and
bring positives.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs will turn 37 before the Sydney Games begin and could
become one of the oldest Americans to win an Olympic gold medal.
She was born in Los Angeles on Aug. 28, 1963, the day that Martin
Luther King Jr. gave his ``I have a dream'' speech in Washington.
Her mother, Cecilia Pinkett, told The Sacramento Bee that King's
speech gave her the determination ``that my daughter's life was
going to count.''
</P>
<P>
   By age 17, Jacobs was participating in the 1980 Olympic trials
as an 800-meter runner. But she never won a collegiate title while
at Stanford, and it was not until the past three years that her
career has reached full flower. In 1993, Jacobs was diagnosed with
low levels of iron in her body, accounting for her wildly erratic
performances on the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``After two weeks of hard training, I couldn't put together hard
workouts for another two weeks,'' Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   She changed her diet, eating more vegetables and red meat, and
began taking iron supplements to boost the deficient levels in her
body and to increase her stamina. Now she has blood drawn weekly to
measure the lactic-acid levels in her system, and she monitors her
heart rate daily to keep from ``running past the warning signs'' in
training, Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At the 1997 and 1999 world championships, Jacobs lost to
Masterkova at 1,500 meters, the second time by less than a second
last August in Seville, Spain. Jacobs keeps a videotape collection
of Masterkova's races, exhaustively analyzing her style and trying
to develop ways to counter the Russian's furious kick. Masterkova,
who is also the reigning Olympic 800-meter champion, can run the
final 100 meters of a 1,500-meter race in 14 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like looking in a rear-view mirror and seeing a Cadillac
coming,'' Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs has worked hard this season to make her own stride more
sound, reaching less with her arms and striking the ground with her
feet under her hips for maximum efficiency. The greatest difference
between the Jacobs who finished 10th to Masterkova at the Atlanta
Olympics and the one who appears ready to challenge for a gold
medal in Sydney is confidence, Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she was nervous,'' Craig said of his wife. ``I don't
think she believed in herself. Now she's at the point where she's
realizing how well she can run. It's confidence, experience. You've
been there before. You're more relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the Olympics, of course, come the finals of the Olympic
trials and a riveting matchup with Favor Hamilton. The top three
finishers in the race will qualify for the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the death of her brother, Suzy is different,'' Craig
said. ``She's not afraid of anything. Regina has the same sort of
attitude: `Who cares? Let's go.' It could be tactical or it could
be the American record. It's going to be fun. I'd love to see it be
the kind of race that can convert 10,000 girls who are playing
soccer back to track and field.''

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: RUSSIA'S NEW PRESIDENT EYES AN UNRULY PRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELEANOR RANDOLPH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Moscow's best journalists, never a particularly sunny lot, now
talk ominously about a return of Soviet-style controls on the
press. They fear, with some reason, that the Kremlin wants to
restore its choke hold on Russia, not simply by bringing order to
government and business, but by setting limits for the country's
struggling new media.
</P>
<P>
   President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly promised that he intends
to make press freedom a cornerstone of Russia's infant democracy.
But in recent days, the former KGB agent has added some disturbing
new definitions for the word ``free.''
</P>
<P>
   During his first annual state of the nation address on July 8,
Putin talked about how ``freedom of journalism has become a juicy
morsel for politicians and major financial groups. ...'' He
criticized media owners who were trying ``to settle scores''
through their publications or were using their powerful voice as
``a tool for fighting government.'' Such tactics, the Russian
president said, create a ``phony freedom.'' What is needed, he
said, are the legal and economic conditions for a ``civilized
information business.''
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that one person's ``civilized information
business'' is another's censored media. If Putin imposes his
favored version of a ``free'' press, no matter how lofty he thinks
his aims, there will not be a free press in Russia. To gain this
most basic liberty for his country, Putin will need something that
may be hard for a former Soviet official to comprehend _ namely a
high tolerance for obstreperous and even offensive media.
</P>
<P>
   At this stage in its liberation from Soviet censors, Russian
journalism offers about as much variety and inconsistency as the
Internet. The same publication can print important news and barely
rewritten corporate press releases or pornography. Verified facts
are often coupled with rumors in an effort to sell more papers.
Still, this untidy mix is an important stage in the media's
transition. At its worst, the new Russian media are still vastly
better than in the old days when truth came only in state-approved
shadings.
</P>
<P>
   Owners of Russia's biggest media outlets have also used their
power unwisely, aiming at political enemies in a vengeful way that
is not unheard of in the West but which ultimately undermines their
own credibility. During the 1996 presidential race, for example,
Russia's new media barons commandeered the airwaves and headlines
on behalf of President Boris Yeltsin, either criticizing, mocking
or virtually ignoring his Communist opponent. The argument at the
time was that the press was fighting for its life against a return
of communism. When Putin complains that news organizations are
settling scores and fighting the government, he may be describing
this tendency, especially by the large media company run by
Vladimir Gusinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But trying to drive independent news organizations out of
business or into submission is not the answer, if Putin wants a
truly free press. The owner of some of the best and most
independent news publications in Russia, Gusinsky has become the
target of a series of investigations of alleged financial
improprieties. Gusinsky, who also runs the only national television
network in the country that is fully independent and steadfastly
critical of Putin, was jailed for a few days last month. Gusinsky's
many talented journalists fear he will be forced out as head of his
company, Media-Most, and be replaced with someone less willing to
challenge the new president.
</P>
<P>
   The warning flags in Russia have already drawn international
concern. A group of journalists, primarily from the World Press
Freedom Committee and the Committee to Protect Journalists, visited
Moscow last week, mainly to protest governmental threats to the
media. The Westerners also advised Russian journalists to improve
their standards of ethics and professionalism, to stop using their
voices as a political or public relations club if they want ``to
claim their vital place in building a free and democratic
society.'' But those problems should be fixed by the journalists
and media barons, not by the Kremlin.

<P>
   A collective groan rose up from the United Airlines check-in
line at La Guardia Airport at 8 a.m. Monday as the announcement
sounded from a loudspeaker. Because of heavy thunderstorms in
Chicago, the disembodied voice intoned, flights to O'Hare
International Airport would be delayed one to four hours.
</P>
<P>
   For Sharon Mantel, a drug saleswoman on her way to a meeting in
Chicago, the day had already had a bad start. She hit a deer on her
way to the airport from her home in Stamford, Conn., shattering her
car's windshield.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days earlier, Jacqueline and Philip Clinton and their
daughters, Caitlyn, 2, and Victoria, 3 months, had arrived four
hours late _ without their luggage _ on their way to Long Island
from their home in Spokane, Wash. Now, rescheduled onto an
afternoon flight to Denver, they faced an even longer trip back.
</P>
<P>
   But for Cindy Miller, an advertising executive who has been
flying at least once a week for four years, it was business as
usual. ``It's just absolutely horrendous,'' she said. ``You just
get used to it after a while. What can you do?''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer was the worst on record for airline delays,
prompting the airlines and the Federal Aviation Administration to
swing into action to try to ease the burden on weary passengers.
Yet despite those efforts, this summer is turning out to be even
worse.
</P>
<P>
   Delays in June rose 16.5 percent from June 1999, according to
the FAA's latest statistics. So far this year they are up 12.7
percent. And with air traffic continuing to expand at a time when
few new airports or runways are on the drawing board, delays may be
a fact of life for years to come, airline executives and government
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   No group of passengers has suffered more of late than those
flying United, the world's largest airline. Just under 57 percent
of the carrier's flights arrived on time in May, far worse than the
performance of its closest competitors, according to the latest
figures compiled by the Department of Transportation. Of the 33
flights that were late more than 80 percent of the time in May, 27
were United's. And United canceled more flights in May _ nearly 9
percent of its schedule _ than any other airline.
</P>
<P>
   May was also the month that United agreed to buy US Airways, the
country's sixth-largest carrier, for $4.3 billion, a deal that
would make it responsible for carrying 25 percent of the country's
air passengers. Many politicians and consumer advocates oppose the
deal _ which has set off a frenzy of merger negotiations among the
other major airlines _ saying it will lead to a decline in both
competition and service.
</P>
<P>
   United blames a stretch of unusually bad weather and an outmoded
air traffic control system that it and other airlines complain is
not up to the task of managing an air transport network carrying
twice as many passengers as it did 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But there is more at work, too _ United's deteriorating
relations with its employees, for example. Six years ago, the
airline's pilots led a group of employees that traded deep wage
cuts and other concessions for stock in United's parent company,
the UAL Corp., making UAL the world's largest employee-owned
company.
</P>
<P>
   Without a new contract since April, many of the pilots have
refused to fly overtime, forcing the airline to cancel thousands of
flights. Both sides say they want to reach an agreement, but the
labor picture could get worse before it gets better: On Wednesday,
the contract covering United's mechanics, gate agents and ramp
workers expired.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything our folks are doing is inconveniencing passengers,
I am truly sorry,'' said Herb Hunter, a 777 captain and spokesman
for the United branch of the Air Line Pilots Association. ``That
can all be fixed if the company would step up and try to take care
of its employees.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for United's difficulties, according to
conversations with dozens of employees and executives over the last
week, is that many of its internal systems, from its arrival and
departure information boards to its baggage handling operations,
have not kept pace with the airline's fast growth.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday was a typical example of United's travails. At 5:30
a.m., violent thunderstorms converged on O'Hare, and the FAA
quickly reduced the number of arrivals there to 40 an hour from the
normal 100.
</P>
<P>
   With that information in hand, under a new program that puts the
FAA and the airlines in closer contact, United began canceling
flights. Like other major airlines, it uses a sophisticated
computer program that determines which flights will cause the least
disruption to passengers and the system if they are grounded.
Ultimately, United canceled 354 of its 2,300 scheduled flights on
Monday, 231 because of weather and air traffic control delays and
the remainder for mechanical problems, unavailable flight crews and
other reasons.
</P>
<P>
   By acting early, said Peter D. McDonald, United's vice president
for operations, United can get word out to passengers about delays
and cancellations. But it does not always work out that way. The
Clintons _ she is a freelance artist, he is an Air Force pilot _
checked with the airline at 6 a.m. Monday before heading to La
Guardia from Wading River on Long Island, where they were staying,
and were told there were no delays. By then, of course, storms were
threatening Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can predict four hours into the future,'' asked
Clinton, ``why couldn't they tell us at 6 a.m.?''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald said that even if United could have correctly forecast
the storms, it would not have been able to anticipate every delay.
``You can predict the weather and you can predict a thunderstorm,
but you can't predict what the FAA will do with the arrival rate,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Customer surveys conducted by United have found that the top
priority of passengers, after arriving safely on time, is getting
accurate information from the airline. Yet because many of United's
computer systems do not communicate with one another, its
front-line employees often are in the dark when flights are
delayed.
</P>
<P>
   Asked at 8:40 a.m. how long the Clintons' original 9 a.m. flight
would be delayed, Willy Pena, a United customer service
representative at La Guardia, looked at a computer screen and said
20 minutes _ despite the earlier warning of delays up to four
hours.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the flight took off more than two hours late, at
11:40 a.m. ``It is difficult to prove the point that we are not
lying,'' acknowledged Graham Atkinson, United's senior vice
president of marketing. ``But it may be that certain people at the
airline may not know what other people know.''
</P>
<P>
   United plans to introduce a system _ at O'Hare by the end of the
summer and systemwide next year _ that will link customer service
representatives, gate agents and arrival and departure monitors
directly to its main operations center in Chicago. Now, the
information they receive has to be updated manually _ which means
that visitors to United's Web site or customers who sign up for its
new paging service, both already connected to the new system,
receive more current information than United's own call center and
airport personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Antiquated systems are also the reason United loses more baggage
than any other airline. In May, it mishandled 6.71 bags per 1,000
passengers, more than twice the number lost by top-rated Alaska
Airlines, according to the government.
</P>
<P>
   John Johnson, who is in charge of deploying baggage handlers at
O'Hare and has worked at United for 31 years, recalled a big
celebration a few years ago when the airline handled a record
51,000 passengers at the airport in one day. Now United routinely
handles that many at O'Hare, its busiest hub, and 55,000 to 60,000
a day is common, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen it this bad before,'' Johnson added. ``This
year is incredible, and I said the same thing about last year.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In April, United began trying to hire another 600 baggage
handlers at O'Hare. Frontline workers there are being outfitted
with radios, and the company is installing scanners around its
system to let it more closely track bags. Also, a new baggage
connection center that is due to open at O'Hare early next year
will link baggage operations directly to customer service. The goal
is for bags to accompany passengers rerouted because of delays,
something that rarely happens now.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask the Clintons. After their flight from Spokane to Denver
was delayed on July 1, the family was put on a later connecting
flight to La Guardia. But their luggage _ including car seats for
their daughters _ did not make it to the new flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't leave the airport,'' Clinton said. Not, at least,
until her parents arrived with car seats they purchased on the way
to La Guardia (which the Clintons returned to the store after their
luggage was delivered by United the following evening).
</P>
<P>
   Their trip home last Monday was even more harrowing. To avoid
the delays at O'Hare, they were taken off the 9 a.m. flight to
Chicago and rebooked on a 2:40 p.m. flight to Denver. After waiting
at La Guardia for nearly four hours, they were delayed more than
five hours more in Denver before taking off for Spokane. The family
finally landed _ with luggage, this time _ after midnight Tuesday
morning, more than 10 hours late.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the experience has not dimmed her husband's enthusiasm
for the skies; he hopes to work for an airline after he finishes
his service in the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won't be flying with a 2-year-old and a baby,'' his wife
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Clinton said. ``That's why I might try to fly for
Fedex. No passengers.''

A TELLING SILENCE GREETS WHITMAN FRISKING PHOTO 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ If Gov. Christie Whitman's political future were
still as bright as it once was, the photo showing her grinning as
she frisked a young black man might have done some real damage.
</P>
<P>
   Black lawmakers and clergymen expressed outrage last week over
the photo, taken when Whitman accompanied state troopers on patrol
in Camden in 1996, and the Rev. Al Sharpton seized on it as proof
of the governor's racial insensitivity. But what was perhaps most
striking about the furor that followed its recent publication was
how little of an effect it was likely to have on Whitman's
political standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about it is, her term's almost over, and she's never
running for anything else again,'' predicted Charles E. Cook Jr.,
editor of the Cook Political Report, a Washington newsletter. ``So
what difference does it make?''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's allies, predictably, argued that Whitman would
emerge unscathed because she quickly admitted that her pat-down of
the man, who had already been searched by troopers, and who was not
arrested, had been a mistake _ though that argument seemed
unpersuasive as she resisted growing demands that she apologize to
the man.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, who said through a spokeswoman that she frisked
the man because she wanted to experience what police officers face,
endured two days of criticism and even ridicule by television
commentators and late-night comedians. But the videotaped beating
of a carjacking suspect by 10 Philadelphia police officers on
Wednesday quickly shifted attention to a far uglier law enforcement
confrontation with its own racial overtones.
</P>
<P>
   The most telling commentary about the governor's gaffe, however,
may have been the silence of most New Jersey Democratic leaders,
who seemed to have nothing to say about it. No faxed attacks, no
breathless phone calls to reporters, no slogans shouted from the
State House steps.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton was hardly alone, of course, in suggesting that the
photograph was so problematic it could cost Whitman a spot on the
Republican ticket with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. ``They say a
picture is worth a thousand words,'' Sharpton said. ``It might be
worth a vice-presidential nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   But what the photo really brought into focus was how far
Whitman's political star had fallen since the picture was taken in
1996. Back then she was at the height of her celebrity, the best
known of the wave of moderate Republican governors elected in 1993
and 1994. A year earlier, she had been asked to deliver the
Republican response to the State of the Union address; in 1996 she
was on Bob Dole's short list of potential running mates, and she
was considered a likely presidential candidate in her own right in
2000 should he lose.
</P>
<P>
   Today, by contrast, with her party's convention coming to New
Jersey's backyard in two weeks, Whitman's horizons are generally
seen as limited to a Cabinet office at best, or even to an
ambassadorship, if Bush wins in November. ``By and large most
people are acknowledging that the vice presidency isn't ready to be
served up to her,'' said Tom Wilson, a former director of the state
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, many believe Whitman may have sacrificed any hope
of a spot on a national ticket in 1997, when she vetoed a ban on
the procedure known to opponents of abortion rights as
partial-birth abortion, and won the undying enmity of her party's
conservative wing.
</P>
<P>
   That fall, for all her popularity, she barely eked out a victory
against James E. McGreevey, then a little-known mayor from
Woodbridge.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen A. Salmore, a Republican campaign consultant often
critical of the governor, said her early exit from the Senate race
pointed up her steadily softening support, which he attributed to a
lack of an ideological or geographical political base.
</P>
<P>
   While Whitman's support for abortion rights and gay rights has
made her a favorite target for conservatives, he said, her
memorable stumbles on race _ from her 1995 remark about ``young
black males'' competing to see ``how many children you can sire
outside of wedlock,'' to the newly surfaced pat-down photo _ have
made her vulnerable to attack from the opposite direction. ``She's
found herself caught in a political no man's land, without support
from the left or the right,'' Salmore said.
</P>
<P>
   But Whitman's spokesman, Pete McDonough, scoffed at past-tense
talk, even though by law she cannot run for governor again when her
term expires in 2001. ``She's 53 years old,'' he said. ``Deciding
to look back now, as if her political career has somehow drawn to a
close, I think is foolhardy. She was the first female governor in
the history of New Jersey. Will she be the first something else in
her life? Probably.''

ANGRY PATRON KILLS CLUB OWNER OVER BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The owner of a Korean nightclub in Midtown Manhattan
was shot dead early Saturday by a customer enraged by his $980
bill, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The customer shot the owner, Sang Dal Choi, 43, several times in
the head inside the Club Nix, in the basement of 6 East 32nd
Street, about 4:25 a.m., said Lt. Stephen Biegel. The man, whom the
police described only as an Asian in his 20s, pulled out a pistol
as he argued with the owner over the check.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect had been in the club with as many as four friends,
said Biegel.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they thought the killer, who fled after the
shooting, had been a customer in the club in the past. But it was
unclear whether he had been identified by detective investigating
the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Choi, who lived in Flushing, Queens, was taken to Bellevue
Hospital Center, where he was pronounced dead, police said.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the shooting, the club was empty except for the
employees and the party with the suspect, the police said. After
the shooting, the people who had been with the gunman also fled,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Two men who work on the block said that the club was popular
with younger Koreans, with patrons primarily in their early to
mid-20s, and that it was often the scene of drunken brawls.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Delgado, who works as a security guard at the Avalon hotel
a few doors away and who has recently worked the night shift, said
the club usually heated up about 2 a.m. ``Every night there's
fights, people punching each other,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another man, Do Hyun Kim, 20, who works in Lee Wireless, a
cellular telephone store near the club, said he visited the night
spot every few weeks. He said security guards at the club frisked
all the male patrons for weapons before they were admitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``People go there and fight all the time,'' he said. ``Come here
at 3 in the morning and you would see drunk people screaming and
staggering all along 32nd Street from one end of the block to
another.''

HILLS ARE ALIVE AGAIN WITH A STRONG KELME RIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIANCON, France _ Although the Kelme team from Spain was a
wild-card choice for the Tour de France, one of three controversial
selections, it showed again Saturday that it belonged in the
20-team field.
</P>
<P>
   For the second time in three mountain stages, a Kelme rider won
and captured the polka-dot jersey of the top-ranked climber. This
time the victor was Santiago Botero, a Colombian who has been
knocking on the door the last few days. He was second on a hilly
stage into Revel on Tuesday and fifth up Mont Ventoux on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Botero took advantage of a seven-man breakaway halfway along in
the 155-mile (249.5-kilometer) 14th stage to build an uncatchable
lead once he left his companions behind on the last of three
mountains in the Alps.
</P>
<P>
   He finished 2 minutes 30 seconds ahead in a total time of 7
hours 56 minutes 13 seconds, a speed of 19 mph on a sunny, cool day
with strong winds on all three climbs.
</P>
<P>
   Both the length of the stage and the winds were cited by Lance
Armstrong, who finished seventh in a group of his leading rivals
and retained his overall lead of nearly five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a long day, a hard day,'' Armstrong, the leader of the
U.S. Postal Service team, said. ``Maybe too long a day. The racing
wasn't aggressive. People took it easy for the first three or four
hours.''
</P>
<P>
   After receiving another yellow jersey, Armstrong was relaxed and
joking at a news conference. Asked if this had been his worst day
in the first two weeks of the three-week Tour, he responded: ``Why?
Did I look bad?''
</P>
<P>
   In fact he looked good _ launching a strong attack on the final
climb and moving alone ahead of his rivals _ but isolated. Jan
Ullrich, in second place overall, had a Telekom teammate to help
him and Richard Virenque, now in fifth place, had a Polti teammate
to help him. Both benefited from the strong pace set by those
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong had nobody to help him once he sped away from the last
man to stay with him, Marco Pantani of the Mercatone Uno team, and
the winner on Mont Ventoux with Armstrong's gracious help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're using our riders a different way this year,'' said Dan
Osipow, the Postal Service team's director of operations. ``Last
year, when Lance won, we had men staying with him as long as
possible on the climbs. This year we're going harder earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   That results in a pace so fast that it leaves behind many men in
the 141-rider field. But it takes an early toll on Armstrong's
support system. So far he has been strong enough to carry on
single-handed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team is proving that they're strong, very strong,''
Armstrong said before the stage. ``Did you see the bottom of the
Ventoux? There were 10 guys there and we had three.'' Although the
two others were gone quickly, they were, as he showed, unnecessary.
He seems confident that the strategy will continue to work in the
next two Alpine stages, Sunday and Tuesday.

   Armstrong praised Botero's winning ride and said the Colombian
might become a rival in what the Texan has referred to as ``this
three-stack we have here in the Alps.''
</P>
<P>
   Botero and the others in the breakaway were not chased
strenuously at first because all of them ranked low in the overall
standings _ Botero was highest placed at 19th overall, 13:11 behind
Armstrong. Now he is eighth, 10 minutes behind.
</P>
<P>
   Paolo Savodelli, an Italian with Saeco and another member of the
breakaway, was second in the stage, with Pantani third, 2:49 behind
when the main chasing group of 11 riders made it up a steep, long
ramp into Briancon, at 1,326 meters the highest city in Europe. The
stage began in Draguignan and headed north.
</P>
<P>
   Of the mountains traversed Saturday, the toughest was the last,
the Izoard, 14 kilometers (8.7 miles) long with a grade of 7.2
percent. It was followed by a 20-kilometer (12.4-mile) twisty
descent into Briancon. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As Virenque broke away on the descent, Armstrong decided it was
payback time for Pantani, whose victory on the Ventoux he did not
dispute. Seeking a pacesetter, he tapped Pantani on the back and
gestured ahead. The Italian, a master descender, nodded and zipped
off, quickly catching Virenque.
</P>
<P>
   No similar downhill will be available at the finish Sunday.
After climbing the Galibier and the Madeleine peaks, both rated
beyond category in toughness, the riders will face a 22-kilometer
(13.7-mile) slog up to Courchevel on a grade of 6.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think tomorrow will be more difficult because today was long
and hard,'' Armstrong said. ``On paper, it looks like a very hard
day.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Allan H. Dobrin, the city's information technology
and telecommunications commissioner, is eminently at home in the
virtual world.
</P>
<P>
   He carries a Palm Pilot V, a Motorola alphanumeric pager, a
wireless IBM laptop, a Startac cell phone and a Nextel cell phone
that works like a walkie-talkie.
</P>
<P>
   It is the real world, with boundaries both physical and
bureaucratic, that sometimes gives him pause.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a state judge in Albany ruled in favor of Dobrin and
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, saying that they, and not the City Council,
had the power to negotiate franchise agreements with cable
television companies.
</P>
<P>
   While Dobrin spends much of his time in meetings or dealing with
matters like the court case, he says he would much rather spend his
time planning new Internet services and finding space for new
fiber-optic cables in in the Silicon Alley of Lower Manhattan. .
</P>
<P>
   ``The advent of the Internet is the opportunity of a lifetime to
fundamentally change the way New York City provides services to its
residents,'' Dobrin said. ``But the challenge is doing it in one of
the largest governments in the country, which has hundreds of
different missions.''
</P>
<P>
   Dobrin serves as the citywide technology officer, the liaison to
the Silicon Alley businesses and the mayor's chief adviser on
information technology. (The mayor has Internet access at his desk
and uses a Palm Pilot to go online while traveling.) Dobrin's
department is also responsible for the 911 system and for
regulating cable television franchises.
</P>
<P>
   Dobrin's aides say their boss recoils from the publicity and
perks other appointees thrive on. He is among the few commissioners
with neither a press secretary nor a driver. He is rarely seen at
fund-raisers or other political events.
</P>
<P>
   R. Ryan Nelson, the director of the Center for Management of
Information Technology at the University of Virginia, said, ``The
changing nature and needs of technology in the last decade have
made jobs like these, especially in complicated, large
bureaucracies like New York City, very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of his time, Dobrin said, is spent on dealing with new
legal or practical issues that arise because of advances in
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Lhota, the deputy mayor for operations, said rapid
changes made Dobrin's job more difficult. ``His goals are a moving
target, because the life cycle in the world of the Internet is
moving so quickly that last year's idea is replaced by a better
structure, and you never know what type of problems you are going
to face.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, one primary concern centers on a lack of space
beneath Lower Manhattan's streets for new fiber-optic cables.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a while, we have been hearing that it is overcrowded
underneath that part of the city _ that when you dig into the
ground, there is no more room to put anything,'' Dobrin said.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers working for Dobrin came up with a solution ingenious
in its simplicity: using 175 miles of abandoned century-old water
pipes in Manhattan and Brooklyn as conduits for the cables. It is
unclear whether it will work.
</P>
<P>
   Dobrin started in city government in the 1980s as an
administrator at the Board of Education. He moved to the mayor's
office in the late 1980s and is among the few political appointees
who has served in the Koch, Dinkins and Giuliani administrations.
He left as chief of staff to former Deputy Mayor Ninfa Segarra in
1997 to become deputy executive administrator of Bellevue Hospital
Center, where he became more interested in technology. But Giuliani
was able to lure him back less than a year later.
</P>
<P>
   He is known for spending 70 hours a week working on technology
problems and preparing the government for one of his favorite
topics: what he calls ``the e-government revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Dobrin would like citizens to be able to go to one Web site to
fill out and pay for all the permits needed to, say, erect a
building, instead of having to visit a dozen agency offices.
</P>
<P>
   That, he said, would reduce the need for city clerks and thus
provide more money for police officers, firefighters and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Within City Hall, Dobrin's name has been mentioned for several
higher positions. But he says he wants to stay in his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to create a reorganized virtual government, as
if you started the government in 2000 instead of 1898,'' Dobrin
said.

 THE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND McLAREN'S RESURGENCE 
By BRAD SPURGEON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ron Dennis reached across the spotless table, picked up the
interviewer's pen and turned the exposed tip away from its
proximity to the interviewer's shirt-sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   Few habitues of Formula One would be surprised with this move by
the owner and director of the series' most successful team. By
caring for every detail of the team, car and working environment,
Dennis has brought 16 world titles to McLaren since he joined it in
1980.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, at the French Grand Prix, he renewed the contract
of his driver David Coulthard. And he confirmed that Mika Hakkinen,
who won the last two drivers' titles with the team, would also keep
his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think one of the most constructive things we can do to make
our task a little easier and to really get focused,'' Dennis said,
``is to make sure the drivers know where they stand for the balance
not only of this year, but next year. I think it will extract that
little bit more from both of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Coulthard won the race and Hakkinen came in
second. As a result, Coulthard comes to the Austrian Grand Prix
near Zeltweg Sunday only 12 points behind Michael Schumacher, who
leads the drivers' series, after trailing by 22. And McLaren is
only six points behind Ferrari.
</P>
<P>
   By the colorful standards of many of the team's competitors, the
sober silver-gray and black McLaren cars are cold looking. But by
most accounts, Dennis' capacity for caring makes McLaren a warm
place to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the impression one gets from the outside but once you
are one of his group, even if you have a bad day, he backs you up
and he stays behind you, whether it's mechanics, drivers or
engineers,'' said Gerhard Berger, who drove for McLaren from 1990
to 1992 alongside Ayrton Senna.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis cares so much about bringing success that he takes it
very hard when McLaren does not win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very painful experience to go back to your hometown,
there's nowhere to hide,'' Dennis said, noting that the failure is
seen by hundreds of millions of television viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis started as a teen-ager by serving coffee and cleaning the
garage for the Brabham team, working free. His first race was when
he was 18, and he went to the Mexican Grand Prix in 1966 as a
mechanic with the Cooper team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at least 10 years younger than anyone else in the pit
lane and probably closer to 20,'' he said. ``And that was a big
advantage when five, 10 years down the road I had all the
experience that would normally be attributable to someone who was
40, 50 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   He rose through the hierarchy to become chief mechanic, which
was like a team manager today. A turning point came when Jack
Brabham, then the team owner, chose Dennis to run his Formula Two
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we had Formula One competence that we applied to a
lower category, the team was very successful and it pretty much
rewrote the way that you went motor racing,'' Dennis said. ``We put
total emphasis on preparation. We had the most immaculate racing
cars and transporters and workshops. Dirt was something that we
just fought against. And it put us in a different league.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the beginning of the Dennis reputation for cleanliness in
a sport that is fundamentally about grease. His 350-member race
staff is issued McLaren clothes that members must wear even at the
spotless factory. The professionalism not only appeals to Dennis'
personal manias, it also impresses sponsors. In the late 1970s, the
Philip Morris Co., the main sponsor of the ailing McLaren team,
took notice and invited Dennis to join it. He merged his team,
Project Four, with McLaren to form McLaren International.
</P>
<P>
   The team had won three world championships since it entered
Formula One in 1966. But during the late 1970s it was overshadowed
by Lotus and Ferrari.
</P>
<P>
   By 1984, however, McLaren won both the drivers' and
constructors' titles.Through the late 1980s, the team dominated the
sport with Alain Prost and Senna, who together won 15 of the 16
races in 1988. Prost left in 1990, and Senna left after the 1993
season, at the start of the most difficult period for the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We essentially went into self-destruction mode,'' Dennis said.
``We had become so used to winning that it seemed there was nothing
we could do to not win. And we lost sense of things.''
</P>
<P>
   He hired Hakkinen in 1993 and Coulthard in 1996. But the
turnaround was when he took on Mercedes as an engine supplier in
1995. Coulthard's triumph in the 1997 season-opening Australian
Grand Prix ended McLaren's longest streak without a victory, three
years and 49 races. McLaren won both the constructors' and the
drivers' championships in 1998 and the drivers' championship in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis, who has feuded with the International Automobile
Federation, said the team's goal is to win every race. Last year at
the Malaysian Grand Prix, McLaren lost the constructors' world
championship when the federation, on appeal, overturned a stewards'
decision that the Ferrari cars were illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my more paranoid moments, I think they're out to get us,''
Dennis said. ``But all that means is that when we win, we really
have to win by all that much more.''
</P>
<P>
   He turned to his assistant a few steps away and said: ``Can you
get the air-conditioners down? It's too cold.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only about one degree too cold, but every detail counts. &QL;

 &HT;    Gore Ridicules Bush Leadership in Texas
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Vice President Al Gore is testing a campaign
strategy against Texas Gov. George W. Bush that, ironically, comes
from Bush's father, former President George H.W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988 the elder Bush, who was then vice-president, torpedoed
the presidential bid of Michael Dukakis by picking apart Dukakis'
record as governor of Massachusetts. If Dukakis can't run a state,
Bush told voters, how can you expect him to run a country.
</P>
<P>
   Now the roles have reversed with Vice President Gore needling
Gov. Bush about his record in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC) here
Saturday, Gore ridiculed the governor's record and painted an
unflattering statistical portrait of Texas, much as the elder Bush
once stood on the shore near polluted Boston Harbor to ridicule
Dukakis's environmental record.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of fish, Gore is focusing on children, specifically,
the welfare of low income children in Texas as way to counter the
``compassionate conservative'' core message of the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Noting on Saturday, for example, that Texas ranks 50th among the
states in providing health coverage to families, Gore sarcastically
questioned the governor's priorities in dealing with the budget
surplus in Texas last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might think that a governor whose state ranks dead last in
the entire nation for families with health coverage, who then gets
a surplus courtesy of the national economic boom, might turn his
attentions to moving from number 50 to, say, 45. Maybe even better.
But nooooo,''Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of taking up or proposing legislation to help them,
Governor Bush made a big tax break for the oil industry the very
first bill that he signed that year. Now, I don't really know how
many oil executives in Texas lack health insurance, but I can tell
you this: A lot of children in Texas do,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The parallels to the 1988 presidential contest were apparent to
the members of the DLC, the centrist organization Gore helped found
in 1985 following the party's disastrous performance in the 1984
election with a liberal, Walter Mondale, at the head of the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope the results are the same (as in 1988),'' quipped
Al From, the DLC president and the founder of the ``new Democrat''
movement that led to the creation of the DLC.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in his speech to the DLC, once again focused on Texas
newspaper accounts this week suggesting that:
</P>
<P>
   A $1.7 billion tax cut Bush pushed through the state legislature
last year has significantly reduced the state's anticipated budget
surplus this year.
</P>
<P>
   One million low income children in Texas are not being served
under a federally funded summer nutrition program because the state
government decided not to spend the $33 million the federal
government provided for the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``This week, as Governor Bush was travelling from photo-op to
photo-op, trying to put the compassion into his conservatism, we
learned that he failed to use tens of millions of dollars budgeted
to feed poor and hungry children during the summer months,'' Gore
said. ``Just because school is out doesn't mean that hunger takes a
summer vacation - or that leadership can go on leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Dan Bartlett said Bush had increased the number
of children served over the summer _ from 175,000 in 1996 to
259,000 this year _ and has already acted to spend $2 million more
on outreach to further bolster participation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worse Al Gore does in the polls, the more he continues to
attack and that's why his credibility deficit continues to grow,''
Bartlett said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas officials have underestimated spending needs on Medicaid
and criminal justice programs by roughly $600 million this year,
eroding an estimated $1 billion budget. The Texas Legislature is
expected to approve a supplemental spending bill to cover the
Medicaid and criminal-justice costs when it convenes next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign arranged for House Budget Committee Chairman
John Kasich, R-Ohio, to respond to Gore's attacks on the Texas
budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich told reporters that the Clinton-Gore administration has
asked for 13 supplemental spending bills since 1993 and Gore
``never complained.'' Now, he added, ``Texas is facing a $600
million supplemental appropriation to meet unexpected needs and the
new Al Gore is on the attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore said Texas's budget surplus is ``rolling away like
tumbleweed,'' his attack was aimed more at Bush's budget cutting
priorities than the shrinking budget surplus in Texas, however.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1999 budget proposal, with Texas reaping a $6.4 billion
budget surplus, its largest ever, Bush suggested $2.6 billion in
tax cuts, including $2 billion to reduce property taxes that fund
public schools, $300 million for businesses and $300 million in
sales tax exemptions. The first bill Bush signed in the 1999 state
legislative session provided the oil industry a $45 million
``emergency'' tax break.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Bush defended signing the tax cuts into law,
saying, ``I did the right thing.'' He said that ``it is a little
too early to project'' how much money the Texas legislature will
need to make up for the shortfall. And, apparently in reference to
his bid to be elected president, he added, ``As you know, I hope
I'm not here to have to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said on Saturday, ``With all due respect to Governor Bush,
America can't afford to deal with it, either.'' He suggested that
Bush's economic policies would return the country to ``the days of
deficits, debt and economic decline'' that he said marked the
administration of the governor's father.

ACTING TOUGH: A SLICE OF LIFE IN LITTLE ITALY 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDWARD WONG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Joe Ruggiero nodded at the two-bit tough guys
flickering on the south wall of the DeSalvio Playground. The
celluloid gangsters might as well have stepped out of his
childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were guys like that everywhere,'' he said. ``The
so-called people in charge, they didn't do anything for the
neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruggiero knew there was a time when mouthing off like that in
Little Italy could have gotten him a broken arm or a bullet in the
head. But these days, he was more likely to be bruised by tourists
jostling for cannoli. For a taste of the old neighborhood, he had
to walk over to the playground at Spring and Mulberry Streets to
watch films like ``Mean Streets,'' the 1973 Martin Scorsese opus in
which Harvey Keitel and Robert De Niro play small-time wise-guys in
Little Italy.
</P>
<P>
   It showed on Friday night, the fifth screening this year in the
free Open Cine film series started in 1996 by Luca Pizzaroni. The
movies run on most Friday nights throughout the summer. Pizzaroni,
a young filmmaker from Rome, had set out to recreate the open air
cinemas so popular in Italian cities. He shows mostly Italian
films, with exceptions like the work of Scorsese, who grew up in
the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   People find out about the screenings through fliers posted on
the park fence or Pizzaroni's Web site, www.nyopencine.com. Most
who go are cinephiles or Italian-Americans from around the corner.
The biggest screening this summer, ``La Dolce Vita,'' drew 200
people.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday, the night got off to a slow start. Kids were
playing on the basketball court and slides well past 8:30. A friend
who was supposed to bring chairs didn't show up, so the two dozen
people in the audience plopped down on flattened cardboard boxes.
Pizzaroni set his 16-millimeter projector on a rickety wooden
ladder and ran an extension cord into the base of a lamp post.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to blow up one of these days,'' he said as he
frantically plugged in the cord.
</P>
<P>
   But soon enough, a beam of light poured from the projector, and
the Ronettes' ``Be My Baby'' boomed across the playground during
the opening credits. Pizzaroni's friends had brought the speakers,
borrowed the ladder from a firehouse, paid for the film rental and
printed the fliers. His supporters were here, even if his e-mail
invitation to Scorsese remained unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   The projector was old, and the picture kept going in and out of
focus. But those in the audience who had grown up in Little Italy
watched the movie with smiles. Ruggiero, whose family emigrated
from southern Italy in 1963, told one spectator that while working
in a bakery he had sold bread to the film crew for a hallway scene.
(Most of the film was made in Los Angeles, but parts were shot in
New York.)
</P>
<P>
   When the film first opened at the now-defunct Fifth Avenue
Cinema, Ruggiero said, he walked into the theater and saw half the
neighborhood there.
</P>
<P>
   ``See, those guys used to live right down the block,'' he said,
pointing to two extras on the screen. ``I don't know their names,
but they must have been friends of the director.''
</P>
<P>
   One audience member, dressed sharply in a black suit and
narrow-brim hat, squinted at the screen. His name was Frank
Huaquilino, but everyone called him Butch the Hat. He had lived his
entire 54 years in the neighborhood, he said, and once ran with an
Italian gang that brawled with Jewish, Puerto Rican and Chinese
gangs.
</P>
<P>
   Scorsese had cast him in small roles in several movies, he said,
and he was acting in a film Pizzaroni was making about
Italian-American extras. He told people of the days when De Niro
hung out on a bench in this playground and talked about getting
into acting.
</P>
<P>
   He waved at the screen as it showed a drunken man stumbling
around a bar and a hoodlum pulling a gun on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``See where he gets killed,'' Butch said to Pizzaroni and his
friends. ``That really happened. It was in the pocketbook store
right down the block. That was a social club in 1968. A guy was
carrying a gun and acting cocky, and those days when you carried a
gun, you had a problem. He was a nice kid, but what can you do?''
</P>
<P>
   Butch's rapt audience leaned closer. He pointed to Mulberry
Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where it happened,'' he said. ``Right there, during the
Feast of Saint Gennaro.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ruggiero, the feast was a thing of the past. These days, it
is no different from any other street festival in the city, he said
to Sam Rohn, one of Pizzaroni's friends. It had gone the way of
everything else in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought they should have kept this place the way it
was,'' he said. ``I don't want to sound nationalistic, but they
should have done it for history's sake. There's only tourists and
restaurants now. What is there to show in a restaurant?''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the Italians assimilated,'' Rohn said. ``That's the way of
all immigrants here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's true,'' Ruggiero said. ``But if there were cultural
institutions like museums and good schools, people would have
stayed here.''
</P>
<P>
   His own parents had moved out to Long Island years ago. These
days, he said, there was too much noise, too much garbage. He shook
his head and stared up at the screen. A woman was walking into her
apartment building carrying groceries, a baguette sticking out of a
sack.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the bread,'' Ruggiero said. ``I'll never forget that
part.''
</P>
<P>
   Pizzaroni lit a cigarette and glanced at the audience. It had
dwindled to a dozen people. No matter. He had already changed the
reels twice, and the movie would end soon. It ended in blood, he
said with a grin. Lots of it.

TITLE INSURANCE: WHO NEEDS IT? 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Conn., N.J., N.Y.)   By JAY ROMANO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At almost every real estate closing there comes a time when the
lawyer for the buyer tells his client how much money it will cost
for the title search and title insurance premium on the property
being purchased.
</P>
<P>
   And frequently, real estate lawyers say, the response from the
buyer is something like, ``If I'm paying somebody good money to
conduct a title search, then why do I need title insurance in the
first place?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a legitimate question,'' said Peter Brav, president of
Good Deed Abstract Corp., a title insurance agency based in Valley
Stream, N.Y. ``I guess the answer is: If we lived in a perfect
world, there would be little need for title insurance because every
search would be perfect and every title would be clear.
Unfortunately, we don't live in perfect world.''
</P>
<P>
   Brav explained that title insurance provides a purchaser of real
property _ and, usually, the purchaser's mortgage lender _ with
protection against any of the many problems that can be associated
with the transfer of real estate. In other words, he said, once a
purchaser buys title insurance, the insurance company agrees _ in
exchange for a one-time-only premium _ to insure the owner's title
to the property for an amount typically equal to the purchase
price.
</P>
<P>
   The costs vary because they are regulated by individual states.
In New York, a title insurance policy on a $250,000 home, including
the title search, would be about $1,600. In Connecticut, such a
policy would cost about $1,100; in New Jersey, about $1,300.
</P>
<P>
   The simplest example of how a title insurance policy might be
used to protect a buyer, he said, would be a case in which there is
a mortgage on the property that was inadvertently missed by the
title searcher. If that mortgage is not paid off at closing, Brav
said, the mortgage would remain as a lien on the property, making
it possible for the person who held the mortgage to foreclose if
the mortgage was not paid in full _ even though the property has a
new owner.
</P>
<P>
   When there is title insurance, he said, the title insurance
company would be responsible for paying off the outstanding balance
on the mortgage, thereby removing the lien.
</P>
<P>
   And while that might appear reasonable _ given that it was the
title company's title searcher who missed the mortgage in the first
place _ such glitches are not always the title searcher's fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many ways for problems with title to arise,'' Brav
said. For example, he said, errors can arise when a document such
as a mortgage or deed is lost, misfiled or incorrectly indexed in
the county recording office. Even simple delays in the recording
process can cause problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some counties in New York that have notable
delays,'' he said, adding that in some areas _ Manhattan,
Westchester, Queens and Suffolk among them _ it can take four weeks
or more for a mortgage or lien on a property to be entered in the
public records.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Brav said, it is possible that in some counties
there may be recent mortgages or liens that have not been recorded
as of the date of closing _ a problem that can cause a major
headache for an unsuspecting purchaser who does not have title
insurance, because such liens and mortgages, if not satisfied at
the closing, can become the responsibility of the new owner.
</P>
<P>
   It is also possible, Brav said, for the lawyer handling the
closing to send an improperly executed document off for recording _
an error that can easily be missed by recording clerks in a busy
office.
</P>
<P>
   And while such an error might not cause an immediate problem for
a buyer, he said, it can cause costly problems years down the road
when some future title searcher discovers that title to the
property had never been properly transferred in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Brav said, errors that cause title problems are not
always inadvertent or even innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you that one of the most common reasons for claims
against title companies is fraud,'' he said, explaining that title
insurance even protects an innocent purchaser who may have the
misfortune of ending up with a forged or fraudulent deed.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Gordon, an assistant vice president in the Stamford,
Conn., office of Commonwealth Land Title Insurance Co., agreed.
``Just because a buyer gets a deed to a property doesn't mean that
the deed was valid,'' Gordon said, explaining that since a deed is
just a document by which the right of ownership in land is
transferred, it can only transfer ownership rights possessed by the
person who made the deed.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, he said, a person who forges another person's
name to a deed _ and then transfers that deed to someone else _ is
not transferring legal ownership of the property, because the
forger never owned it in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, Gordon said, and a person who claims to be the
true owner then sues the person who bought the property from the
forger, the title insurance company will typically provide a legal
defense and pay all related fees and costs of the lawsuit. If the
claim proves valid, he said, the title company would be responsible
for reimbursing the new owner for all losses incurred, up to the
face amount of the policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition,'' Gordon said, ``a deed doesn't do away with the
rights that others have in the property, and it won't show you
liens or claims that may be outstanding against the title.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he said, there are some hidden hazards that even the
most diligent title search may not reveal. For example, he said, a
previous owner could have incorrectly stated his marital status,
resulting in a possible claim by his legal spouse. Other hidden
hazards can be the result of defective deeds; deeds executed by
people declared mentally incompetent or those who have invalid
powers of attorney; and confusion regarding ownership because of
similar or identical names and clerical errors in the records.
</P>
<P>
   William Selsberg, a Stamford, Conn., real estate lawyer, said
that he had handled several closings in which clients ended up with
liens on their property for taxes owed by a previous owner that
were missed by the title searcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mistakes happen,'' he said, adding, however, that since the
clients had title insurance coverage, the liens were paid by the
title company. ``When clients ask me if they really need title
insurance, I tell them: `Look, I'm a lawyer and I know how to
search a title, but when I bought my own house, I made sure that I
got coverage. I know what can happen.''

NEW GOLD COAST NEAR DOWNTOWN CHICAGO 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT SHAROFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ In a throwback to the early years of the 20th century
when wealthy Chicago families tended to live in such close-in
neighborhoods as Prairie Avenue and the Gold Coast, the city's
Lincoln Park area is experiencing a boom in mansion construction.
</P>
<P>
   In the last five years, the neighborhood, about a mile and a
half north of the Loop, has seen construction of dozens of examples
of the kind of house that had not been built in any great numbers
in the inner city in many years. They are palatial residences of at
least 6,000 square feet that start at around $2.5 million and go
much higher.
</P>
<P>
   The number of such houses, like the official definition of what
constitutes a mansion, is difficult to ascertain. Most people seem
to know one when they see one, however. And the evidence of a
dramatic change in the neighborhood's fortunes is clear from a walk
down any of the long blocks of Howe or Mohawk or Burling streets
just north of Old Town.
</P>
<P>
   Looming over the remaining original housing _ mainly modestly
scaled clapboard cottages and brick three-flats that date from just
after the Chicago fire in 1871 _ are the elaborate limestone
facades of dozens of new three- and four-story houses.
</P>
<P>
   Who is buying them? Real estate agents and builders say the main
clients are couples and families in their mid-30s and early 40s who
have struck it rich in the booming economy of the last decade and
are choosing to stay in the city rather than move to the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the new wave,'' said Sean Conlon, director of sales
and marketing for Sussex &AMP; Reilly, a leading North Side residential
brokerage firm. ``The last people to build houses this big downtown
were the great industrialists and robber barons of the 1890s. But
they built over on the Gold Coast. A new neighborhood is emerging
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Conlon, 31, recently moved into a new four-story,
6,000-square-foot house on Mohawk Street with a slate mansard roof,
arched windows and lavish detailing. ``They had homes like this in
Paris and London in the 1700s and 1800s,'' he said. ``It's an
exquisite, timeless style.''
</P>
<P>
   Conlon's house is typical of the prevailing look of the new
houses. The style, which leans heavily toward limestone columns,
balustrades and elaborate fruit and flower friezework, is usually
described as Georgian or classical or beaux-arts.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, it is an unlikely look for the Chicago area, the
birthplace of modern architecture and the home of such modernist
giants as Frank Lloyd Wright and Mies van der Rohe.
</P>
<P>
   ``They look like banks,'' said one top real estate agent who
requested anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   John Vinci of Vinci/Hamp Architects, a firm noted locally for
historic renovation, calls them fantasy houses. ``They're
emulations of turn-of-the-century Parisian or Belgian grand
houses,'' he said. ``It's just fantasy to build these houses now.''
</P>
<P>
   Vinci is also the architect _ along with the late Max Gordon, a
British architect _ of the house that many say was the beginning of
the whole downtown mansion trend. Nine years ago, Lewis Manilow, a
local investor and chairman of President Clinton's Illinois
fund-raising committee, went looking for what he called ``a country
house in the city.'' When he could not find one, he decided to
build a new house on four adjoining lots that he had acquired on
Howe Street.
</P>
<P>
   Howe Street at that time, Vinci said, was ``a street of small
houses'' in a neighborhood that had been steadily gentrifying since
the 1970s but had yet to see much new construction.
</P>
<P>
   The house Vinci designed is a modern, 10,000-square-foot tan
brick structure with a sizable garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to consolidate my life,'' Manilow said. ``I used to
have a condo as well as a loft where I had my office and part of my
art collection. Now everything is in one place.'' Why Lincoln Park?
``It's very urban,'' Manilow said. ``You can walk downtown, to the
lake, the park. There's lots of people on the street. It's just a
very friendly neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Another consideration is the availability of land for
construction, free of landmark-district constraints. Traditionally,
the wealthy in Chicago have lived on the Gold Coast, a roughly
12-square-block area that includes Lake Shore Drive and Astor
Street and is just south and east of Lincoln Park.
</P>
<P>
   Developed around the turn of the century, the housing is a mix
of mainly co-op apartment buildings and historic mansions and row
houses, many of which are official landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only 80-some single-family houses on the Gold Coast,''
said James M. Kinney, president of Rubloff Residential Properties,
a leading downtown residential brokerage. ``And you have to get
neighborhood approval to tear anything down. Lincoln Park, however,
aside from a few areas, isn't landmarked. You can build what you
want.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly what is happening. ``I get calls every day from
people who are looking to build in the neighborhood,'' said
Elizabeth Ballis, a saleswoman with Coldwell Banker's Lincoln Park
office.
</P>
<P>
   The new houses are a mix of build-to-suits and speculative
ventures by half a dozen custom builders. The two most influential
are Metzler Hull Development Corp. and BGD&AMP;C Corp. Both are local
companies that build four or five houses a year. The houses
generally take 12 to 14 months to complete.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jay Metzler, one of the principals of Metzler Hull,
the process begins with finding land, something that has become
more difficult in the last few years. Single 25-foot-by-125-foot
lots now sell for up to $700,000 or $800,000 and the ideal is two
or more contiguous lots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're building a $2.8 million spec house right now on a single
lot and the land is a quarter of the price,'' Metzler said. ``We
like doing specs. They give us a chance to exercise our creativity.
We've done 12 to 15 of them over the last few years and all but one
sold well before they were finished.''
</P>
<P>
   Both companies stress that what sells is luxurious details and
craftsmanship. ``We spend a lot of time in Europe researching
moldings, door designs and other features that people seem to have
gotten away from over here,'' said Charles Grode, vice president of
BGD&AMP;C.

</P>
<P>
   He added that the company recently built an 8,500-square-foot
Venetian-style home on a double lot on Burling Street that is
authentic ``right down to the chimney caps.'' The roof, he added,
is made of ``100-year-old clay tiles from a building in
Philadelphia.''
</P>
<P>
   His customers ``want the details to be rich,'' Metzler said.
This means, as a matter of course, mahogany paneling and window
frames throughout, marble and oak floors, grand curving staircases
and _ in some houses _ 20- and 25-foot-high ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   How do they differ from the grand houses of the past? ``They
don't have ballrooms,'' said Vinci, the architect.
</P>
<P>
   What they do have, however, are children. Both companies say
that children's rooms and activities have a new prominence in most
of their houses. Metzler said he was building a roller-hockey rink
in the basement of one house and was planning a basketball court in
the basement of another. The basketball court alone, he said, will
add more than $200,000 to the cost of the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an absolute dream house,'' said Elizabeth Saltzman,
who along with her husband, Richard, the owner of Banner Wholesale
Grocers, recently bought a Metzler Hull house. ``We looked at some
older houses, but we have four kids and it can be tough to find
that many bedrooms in an older house. There's a very welcoming
feeling here. People sit on their porches and stoops. The kids have
a certain freedom that they probably wouldn't have in other
neighborhoods. They can walk to the park and do things by
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Her verdict? ``As long as we can afford it, we're staying.''

JOHN MORGAN, ETIQUETTE MAVEN FOR THE BRITISH, DIES AT 41 
</HEADLINE>
   By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Morgan, a dashingly dapper dandy who took it upon himself
to dictate to the proper English about proper manners, down to the
correct attire for impressing a former wife's rich young boyfriend,
fell to his death on July 10 from the window of his third-floor
London apartment. He was 41.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan wrote a weekly etiquette column for The Times of London,
was style editor of the British edition of GQ magazine and in 1996
wrote ``Debrett's New Guide to Etiquette and Manners,'' published
by Headline, which was a best seller in England. Two months ago,
when a collection of his columns, ``The Times Book of Modern
Manners,'' was published by HarperCollins, the publication was
celebrated at a glittering party at the Royal Opera House.
</P>
<P>
   His influence was suggested by the fact that the Conservative
Party leader, William Hague, accepted his unsolicited advice to
stop wearing baseball caps.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan never shrank from taking controversial stands, like his
stalwart opposition to the public breast-feeding of infants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thoughtful hosts offer lactating visitors a quiet room where
they can feed away from the general throng,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan's range of knowledge extended from proper dress for a
royal garden party (pants suits are frowned upon) to sartorial
recommendations for a sexual fetish party. ``Come on, loosen up,''
he urged a nervous correspondent.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan knew the proper way to eat a banana. ``The best technique
involves first laying the banana horizontally across your fruit
plate, cutting off each end and then slicing the skin lengthways,''
he wrote. Pomegranates? These, he said, are best devoured
privately, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan's personal sense of high style was reflected by the 300
monogrammed shirts, 90 pairs of handmade shoes and 60 Savile Row
suits found in his small apartment. He packed his shirts for
weekend visits in tissue paper and transported his shoes in a
special wicker basket. He cashed his checks at the luxury hotel
Claridge's.
</P>
<P>
   News reports in London said the police did not suspect foul play
in his death. His body was found on the sidewalk outside his home
in Albany Court near Piccadilly. His death was attributed to severe
head injuries.
</P>
<P>
   An article in The Guardian quoted some of his friends as saying
he may have been experiencing financial difficulties. Some said he
had suffered occasional bouts of depression, treated with
anti-depressants. He never married and lived alone.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony John Morgan was born on May 28, 1959, in Sunderland,
England, and moved to Perth, Scotland, when he was very young. His
father, Basil, worked as a manager for Royal Dutch Shell in Perth.
He, his mother, Annie, and a brother survive him. All live in
Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Though his cultivated accent bespoke Eton or Harrow, his
educational background actually included the Cheltenham Art School,
where he supplemented his income by playing the piano in a local
restaurant. He then moved to London, where he worked as an
assistant to Percy Savage, a prominent public relations executive.
</P>
<P>
   He worked for The Guardian newspaper, on the fashion beat, then
joined GQ, Conde Nast's new magazine, in 1988. He became style
editor with responsibility for a section of the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was incredibly courteous,'' Dylan Jones, the current editor
of GQ told The Guardian ``He was a great charmer, very thoughtful,
very kind and funny. He was the best dressed man I ever met.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan wrote The Times column for three years, and editors said
he received great amounts of mail. But not all his notices were
favorable. An article by Matthew Engel in The Guardian last month
chided Morgan for an inclination ``to be prescriptive and
proscriptive.'' In particular, the recommendation that birth
announcements weigh precisely 335 grams struck Engel as excessively
persnickety.
</P>
<P>
   But Morgan liked to have the last word. He wrote in his new book
that death was becoming more stylish as the population aged, and
included a chapter titled ``Death Duties.''
</P>
<P>
   He advised, ``Every effort should be made to do things well and
this includes the dress of mourners.''

   BRITISH _ The Old Course: It is said to be one of the most
beautiful venues in golf. No island greens; no doctored doglegs; no
tricked-up, pitch-and-putt holes. Instead, the natural setting for
St. Andrews remains as it was when the course was constructed back
in the old days. Yes, you sometimes must hit your tee shot over a
boarding house. And yes, you might have to hit off a gravel road.
And those are just two of the reasons the 2000 British Open will
offer challenges to the best golf has to offer. (Sheeley) 25''

PAUL HENRY MUSSEN, 78, CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST AND AUTHOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.J., Wis., Ohio)   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Henry Mussen, a child psychologist who wrote a classic
textbook and taught for 30 years at the University of California at
Berkeley, died July 7 in Berkeley. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was prostate cancer, the university said.
</P>
<P>
   Mussen's books focus on interactions between parent and child,
an emerging concern in the 1950s when the first of them were
published; they were widely translated, and a number of them remain
in print.
</P>
<P>
   He was the principal author of the seminal ``Child Development
and Personality,'' first published in 1956. It was a standard for
30 years and made Mussen the best-selling author at Harper
Textbooks for years.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote ``The Psychological Development of the Child''
(Prentice-Hall, 1963), and was the co-author of ``Roots of Caring,
Sharing and Helping'' (W.H. Freeman, 1977), ``Psychological
Development: A Life-Span Approach'' (Harper, 1979), ``Essentials of
Child Development and Personality'' (Harper, 1980), and ``The Roots
of Prosocial Behavior in Children'' (Cambridge University Press,
1989), among others.
</P>
<P>
   Mussen was the main editor of the four-volume ``Handbook of
Child Psychology.'' Its fourth edition was published by Wiley in
1983. He also edited the Annual Review of Psychology from 1968 to
1973.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Mussen was born in Paterson, N.J., and graduated in 1942
from Stanford University, where he received an M.A. degree in 1943.
He then served in the Navy until 1946.
</P>
<P>
   He completed his Ph.D. in psychology at Yale University in 1949
and taught at the University of Wisconsin and Ohio State University
before joining the Berkeley faculty in 1956. He was a past director
of the Institute of Human Development at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   He traveled as a lecturer and consultant to universities
throughout Europe, the Middle East, the Far East and Australia. He
was one of the first American professors to teach in China after
the Cultural Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Mussen is survived by his wife of 46 years, Ethel Foladore
Mussen; a daughter, Michele, of Berkeley; a son, Jim, of New York;
a brother, Irwin, of Berkeley; and one grandson.

ROBERT DIERBECK, DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKER, DIES AT 71  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Ill., Wis.)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Dierbeck, a documentary filmmaker whose interest in
science and wildlife carried him around the world, died July 7 in
New York. He was 71 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was emphysema, said his wife, Janet.
</P>
<P>
   Dierbeck produced, wrote and directed films about a wide range
of subjects, from oceanography (``The Earth and the Sea'') to
anthropology (``Nomads of the Rain Forest''), often working with
grants from the National Science Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   His 1966 documentary, ``Flying at the Bottom of the Sea,'' about
oceanographic research, was awarded the Grand Prix de la Marine
Nationale in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Many of his films have been presented at the Margaret Mead Film
Festival and at other festivals worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Early in his career Dierbeck, who was born in Urbana, Ill., was
associate curator of education at the Milwaukee Public Museum.
</P>
<P>
   After retiring, he served as a consultant for the anthropology
department of the American Museum of Natural History and
occasionally narrated documentary films.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Lisa
Dierbeck, of Brooklyn.

JACK DALTON, 92, AUTHORITY IN LIBRARY STUDIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Ala.)   By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jack Dalton, who was dean of Columbia University's School of
Library Services, died on July 7 at his home in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Dalton headed the library services school from 1959 until 1970.
The school was closed in 1992. While dean, he was a teacher as well
as an administrator, and he introduced courses in information
science into the school's curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   James S. Healey, the former director of library schools at the
University of Oklahoma and at San Jose State University in
California, studied at Columbia while Dalton was the dean.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had assembled a truly outstanding faculty, some of the best
people in our field in the world,'' Healey said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Dalton, who was born in Holland, Va., received bachelor's and
master's degrees from the University of Virginia. He took courses
at the University of Michigan in 1935 and 1936. He later was
director of the American Library Association's international
relations office from 1956 to 1959.
</P>
<P>
   After retiring from Columbia, Dalton directed the Library
Development Center, which advocates better library services for the
disabled and disadvantaged. He was also a consultant to the H.W.
Wilson publishing company.
</P>
<P>
   His first wife, Mary Gochnauer Dalton, died.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his second wife, Margaret Stieg Dalton; a son,
John Preston Dalton of Tuscaloosa, Ala.; a brother, Robert, of St.
Thomas, Virgin Islands; and a sister, Antoinette Nelson of
Lynchburg, Va.

URSULE MOLINARO, A WRITER OF NOVELS AND PLAYS  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Va., Hawaii)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ursule Molinaro, a novelist and translator, died Monday at her
home in New York City. She was believed to have been in her 80s,
said McPherson &AMP; Co., her publishers.
</P>
<P>
   In a career that spanned five decades, she wrote 14 novels, four
collections of short fiction and 18 one-act plays. She also
translated books and was fluent in five languages.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Paris, Molinaro was educated at the Sorbonne and the
University of London, and studied medicine in Florence, Italy.
Jailed for harboring Jews in Paris during World War II, she escaped
and joined the Resistance. After the war she became a free-lance
journalist and soon published her first book, a collection of
fables.
</P>
<P>
   She came to New York in the 1950s as a simultaneous translator
at the United Nations and adopted English as her primary language.
Her first book published here was ``Mirrors for Small Beasts''
(Noonday Press) in 1960. That year she was also one of the founders
of Chelsea magazine, a literary journal.
</P>
<P>
   Molinaro's books include ``The Borrower,'' ``Green Lights Are
Blue'' and ``Sounds of a Drunken Summer.''
</P>
<P>
   During the '60s and '70s Molinaro wrote a series of one-act
plays and translated works by such authors as Hermann Hesse,
Nathalie Sarraute and Christa Wolf for publication in English. She
also taught at Virginia Polytechnic Institute, the University of
Hawaii and New York University.
</P>
<P>
   Her most recent book, a trio of short satirical novels under the
title ``Demons and Divas,'' was published this year.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by a daughter.

TOWNS COLUMN: SUMMER CAMP LIKE ANY OTHER: ORDINARY PEOPLE, ORDINARY
FUN 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW PURDY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTER, N.Y. _ ``What we're going to do today,'' the drama
counselor said to the girls of Bunk One, ``is we're going to be
models. We're going to put some makeup on. Do our hair. Put on some
clothes. And then we're going to have a fashion show.''
</P>
<P>
   Out came the eyeliner, the red lipstick, the sparkly nail
polish, the scarves and fancy dresses. A camper named Lauren
declared her done-up bunk mates gorgeous.
</P>
<P>
   These campers are not models in the outside world. They are
exceptions, delicately and ambiguously called special.
</P>
<P>
   Here at Camp Loyaltown, in the shadow of Hunter Mountain, they
are ordinary _ the adults with Down syndrome, the autistic
children, the emotionally and mentally limited, the childlike
spirits frozen in wrinkled, stooped bodies. They swim and sing and
put on plays and shout silly cheers in the cafeteria and pump
themselves up for a softball game against a rival camp.
</P>
<P>
   Those who can talk, do, some engagingly. Those given to hugging,
hug indiscriminately. Some are sullen and moody. Many are silent
and smiling. They produce a newspaper, The Happy Camper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a dream,'' said Vanessa Radke, 30, a counselor from
London. ``You have to come back to make sure it's real.'' She's
returned nine summers, drawn by a camper with Down syndrome named
Patty. ``She's about my age and she's just amazing,'' Radke said.
``She has very little speech. She's just so lovely. She speaks to
me with her eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   People here often refer to a short essay called ``Welcome to
Holland.'' In it, a parent likens raising a disabled child to
planning a vacation to Italy, only to have the plane land in the
Netherlands. Sorely disappointed, you find the Netherlands slower
and more drab. But eventually you discover the windmills and the
tulips and the Rembrandts. ``It's just a different trip,'' a
camper's father said.
</P>
<P>
   Each summer more than 500 people attend the camp, run by the
Nassau County chapter of the Association for the Help of Retarded
Children. Paul H. Cullen, the camp director for 22 years, hires 150
counselors and strives for an environment where the disabled ``do
not experience their handicap as interfering with their enjoyment
of life.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also a respite for parents. ``These kids are
all-consuming,'' said Sloan Ettinger, visiting her 18-year-old
stepdaughter, Brandy, who is the size of a 4-year-old and rides in
a stroller. ``Imagine having a toddler in your house for 38
years.''
</P>
<P>
   The campers stay in bunks: summer societies of complex
characters. Bunk One has Gabbi, at 13 a social butterfly with Down
syndrome, as strong-willed as she is well spoken, depending on her
mood. There is Lauren, 19, an inveterate Islanders fan with a
revolving list of favorite counselors, mostly males.
</P>
<P>
   There is Brandy, her little hands forever reaching for someone
to touch, and Melissa, 18, always willing to hold them. Chrissy,
21, is silent, but meets everyone's eye with a smile. Katie, 20,
has Down syndrome, and sometimes surprises with her enthusiasm, as
when singing ``Happy Birthday'' to campers during lunch.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, the six baked an apple crumble, dressed for their
fashion show and made witches out of pipe cleaners and fabric.
(``It's not a witch,'' Lauren insisted. ``It's my Islanders guy!'')
Lauren complained loudly at lunch that Gabbi's banging was giving
her a headache. Brandy told her visiting stepmother in a slow,
determined voice, ``I love you, too.'' The counselors recounted the
thrill of getting Gabbi out of bed in the morning or helping
Chrissy learn to shower herself.
</P>
<P>
   In the late morning, Julie Trimble, a counselor from Belfast,
Northern Ireland, announced it was time for cooking class. Gabbi
assumed her usual traveling position _ on Julie's back. Gabbi
pressed her freckled cheek against Julie's, and they laughed and
said together what Julie always teases in her Irish lilt, ``You're
a big, lazy lump.''
</P>
<P>
   The night before had been Karaoke Night. The girls in Bunk One
had performed ``Holiday'' by Madonna.
</P>
<P>
   Counselors and campers crowded the recreation hall. The music
deafened. A bubble machine belched bubbles. Lights flashed. The
wooden floor bounced. Campers and counselors moved to the same
music. On stage, Melissa grabbed the mike. Gabbi, refusing to sing
at first, came alive, screaming wildly, dancing with her head
thrown back. Even Brandy, in the arms of a counselor, bobbed up and
down. The room was in a roar. For a moment, ``special'' and
``normal'' didn't matter. It was just camp.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Preservationists gnash their teeth when confronted
with half a building _ some elegant landmark where the bottom or
the top has been torn off or mutilated. But the 1857 Cary Building,
at 105 Chambers St., has a dissonance of another sort. The
intricate twin cast-iron facades facing Chambers and Reade Streets
are surprisingly intact, but the widening of Church Street in the
1920s exposed a 200-foot-long utilitarian side wall of unadorned
brick. There is not too little of the Cary Building but too much.
</P>
<P>
   After the construction of City Hall in 1811, the blocks to the
west filled up with elegant houses. In 1818 Mary Mason Jones _
memorialized as Mrs. Manson Mingott by her niece Edith Wharton in
``The Age of Innocence'' _ built a house at 122 Chambers St.,
between Church Street and West Broadway. The New York Times said
the Jones residence was the first in the city to have gas lighting
and a bathtub.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1850s the same streets were full of businesses and
boarding houses, and in 1857 William H. Cary put up the biggest
building on the block, 50 feet wide and reaching 200 feet back to
Reade Street. Cary had established the dry-goods firm of Cary,
Howard &AMP; Sanger in the 1830s and the Union Sketchbook of 1861, a
business guide and directory, described his new store as ``the
product of the taste and ingenuity of three continents ... 1,500
different kinds of foreign and domestic fancy goods, comprising
jewelry, perfumes, watches, cutlery, guns, musical instruments,
combs, brushes.''
</P>
<P>
   Cary had built cast-iron storefronts on Fulton Street in
Brooklyn and on Pearl Street in Manhattan designed by the
architects King &AMP; Kellum and cast by Daniel Badger's influential
Architectural Iron Works in Manhattan. For 105 Chambers Street,
Cary returned to the same team but had them design and erect two
entire five-story facades.
</P>
<P>
   The original ground floor was a straightforward series of
windows and doors separated by slender columns. The upper floors
are arcades of windows separated by paired columns, set on a field
of cast iron modeled after rusticated blocks of stone. Above
everything is an intricately modeled cornice and a large central
medallion reading ``Cary Building.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cary Building was one of New York's most notable cast-iron
buildings, but it was eclipsed by the 1856 Haughwout Building at
Broadway and Broome Street because of the latter's corner location.
In 1857 the Cary Building was still two lots west of Church Street.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1850s and 1860s cast iron was a miracle material. The
iron framing permitted the wider windows so important for retail
stores, and also allowed for quick construction in mass-produced
but highly detailed designs. Daniel Badger's 1865 catalog lists 19
cast-iron commissions on the two blocks of Chambers Street from
Broadway to West Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Cary died in 1861, and although Cary, Howard &AMP; Sanger dissolved,
the Cary family held on to 105 Chambers St. as an investment until
1950. In the 1920s, during their ownership, Church Street was
widened and the Cary Building lost its easterly neighbors and
gained its current corner position. Although some windows were cut
through the facade after the street was widened, and more windows
were added later, the Church Street side still presents an ungainly
contrast to the delicately modeled cast iron.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980 the Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the
Cary Building as a landmark. These days the building, although
mostly intact, looks forlorn, its upper floors vacant. Rust stains
bloom over the entire facade, which looks like it has been dunked
in tea. But a new owner, Chambers Street LLC, has begun a two-part
restoration plan.
</P>
<P>
   The architect Martin J. Marcus is designing new commercial
spaces for the first four floors. And the firm of Li/Saltzman
Architects is designing three residential spaces for the top floor,
along with an exterior restoration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The detail of this building is just astounding, how far they
went to imitate stone,'' said Judith Saltzman, a principal of
Li/Saltzman. She said her firm is examining options for replacing
missing elements in cast iron, cast aluminum and fiberglass for an
estimated cost of about $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   To determine the original paint color, a microscopic paint
analysis was undertaken by the New Jersey firm Historic
Preservation and Illumination. Cynthia Hinson, head of the company,
said that the original color was a uniform yellowy white, with sand
thrown or blown on the the wet paint to imitate the granular
surface of stone.
</P>
<P>
   The techniques of paint analysis have advanced significantly in
the last 15 years, and it is now common even in routine
preservation projects. Raymond Pepi, president of Building
Conservation Associates in Manhattan, said that the earliest
methods were often used to analyze interior paint finishes in
residential buildings and were derived from the work of art
restorers, who often had to strip away successive layers of paint.
</P>
<P>
   But since he began work in the 1970s, Pepi said that the
discipline had advanced on its own, especially with color matching
by colorimeter, instead of eyeball judgment, and staining and
fluorescent microscopy, which can reveal layers invisible to the
eye.
</P>
<P>
   The kind of work necessary for the Chambers and Reade Street
facades is similar to work done on other buildings in the area. The
expanse of raw brick exposed by the long-ago widening of Church
Street will also remain largely as it is, with the exception of new
windows.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to treat such an unadorned wall is with
illusionistic detail _ like the side wall of the cast-iron building
at 112 Prince St., near Greene Street, where the muralist Richard
Haas continued the front of the building along the side wall, which
was exposed by demolition of the adjacent structure.
</P>
<P>
   But Saltzman is not pursuing that kind of expression. She said
that she was trying only to relate some additional window openings
on Church Street that are part of the renovation to the rhythm of
the old ones. As for the unadorned wall, she said, ``We just want
to let it read as something that was not originally meant to be
exposed.''

THE NEW GAME AT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL: PICKING YOUR CHILD'S TEACHER 
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE GROSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PELHAM, N.Y. _ There is a new kind of finagling afoot in the
land of overachieving parents and their prized children. The game
is as stylized as a Japanese tea ceremony but the goal is simple:
handpick a child's elementary school teacher while pretending not
to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Once this was a bureaucratic routine, something parents didn't
know about or figured was somebody else's job. But that was before
suburbanites picked communities based on the number of Advanced
Placement classes, spent more on SAT tutors than on college tuition
and planned a child's summer to impress the Ivy League admissions
office.
</P>
<P>
   Like any new game, this one has a set of rules, laid down with
great precision in certain places, this community in southern
Westchester County being among them. There is a window of
opportunity each spring when parents are invited to write or call
their elementary school principal to discuss the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   The contact must be made in May, before May 26 to be exact, in
at least one of the four elementary schools here. The parents are
encouraged to discuss ``learning styles'' and ``teaching styles.''
They are forbidden to say which teacher they want.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody is fooled. Mothers acknowledge writing disingenuous
letters that avoid saying ``Mr. B stinks so give me Mr. A,'' even
though that is what they mean. The principals say that if the
desired match is made, it is because parents and school
professionals usually agree about what is best for the child.
</P>
<P>
   The results of all this conniving will be seen in official
notification letters later this month, when parents are told whose
class their child will be in.
</P>
<P>
   But meanwhile, at the village pool and the Metro-North platform,
the buzz these days is about the merits of one teacher over
another: Who is strict? Who is kind? Who is stimulating? Who is
over the hill? The information is passed along the grapevine. And
accurate or not, it leaves some parents with palpitations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gets a lot of airplay, but unreasonably so,'' said Gerard
Finelli, principal of Colonial Elementary School. ``Why is it given
all this attention? Isn't it a distortion? And if it gets to a
certain degree, it comes back to hurt the children. But it's
endemic to our society today.''
</P>
<P>
   A generation ago, parents would not have dreamed of trying to
influence the selection process. Linda Peters, the mother of two
children at Colonial and a product of parochial schools, recalls
arriving the first day and being directed to a classroom, with no
ifs, ands or buts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You showed up and they called your name,'' said Peters, who
sells advertising for Glamour magazine. ``And with the nuns, you
got mean, meaner or meanest.''
</P>
<P>
   But that was then and this is now. So Peters was not shy when
she thought her son Trevor, now entering fourth grade, had had one
too many novice teachers. Finelli deferred to her and assigned the
boy to a seasoned hand. It was a disaster, Peters said, and she had
no one to blame but herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we know about teachers is what we've heard from our
friends, and it may not be a reality,'' she said. ``I don't think
parents should have a say.''
</P>
<P>
   But parents who have not been burned by their own intervention
either meddle, consider meddling or worry about not meddling. One
Pelham mother _ and according to the principal, all of the
lobbyists have been mothers _ is already plotting how to get the
teacher she wants for the 2001-02 school year.
</P>
<P>
   And the parents who do not know the rules of the game _ some
schools publish them in their handbooks while others do not _ are
furious when they discover they have been bested by somebody else.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mysterious process, like Kabuki theater,'' said one
mother, who like many others asked not to be identified, out of
fear of retaliation against her children. ``It all happens behind
the screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Take Pamela Arsove, an emergency room doctor and mother of two,
who was told at a July 4 barbecue that another parent had gotten a
sneak preview of the class lists and knew what teacher her daughter
was getting in fourth grade.
</P>
<P>
   Who could have leaked this closely held information, Arsove
wondered. Why did it go to another mother and not to her? Was she
at a disadvantage because she spent less time at school than the
stay-at-home mothers? And how could she have slipped up and not
been a proper advocate for her child?
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like an idiot,'' Arsove said recently, acknowledging
that the July 4 shocker had produced a migraine headache, weeks of
agitation and angry telephone calls to Colonial Elementary, where
Finelli said he made a thorough inquiry and was satisfied the class
lists had not left the building.
</P>
<P>
   Arsove is one of many working mothers who are sure they suffer
for not being regulars at school. Finelli said he had heard parents
express that, ``but it's not a perception I agree with.''
</P>
<P>
   But the perception, real or imagined, is a window into the gulf
between mothers who stand sentry in the playground and supervise
field trips and those who leave for work at dawn and do not return
until dark. And a handy place for an anxious mother to see
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Peters worries that she sees the principal only ``when I have a
bone to pick,'' not an ideal way to form a trusting relationship.
And Arsove wonders how she can compete with another mother who has
had lunch with the school psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Allen, a former accountant and now a stay-at-home mother,
is saddened to hear that others feel that way, but she sees their
point.
</P>
<P>
   She runs a publishing center at Colonial, where children produce
books of their own writings, and is thus in the building virtually
every day. That means easy chitchat with the teachers, a first-name
relationship with Finelli, knowledge of who pulls the levers of
power and a sense of humor about the process that the working
mothers envy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't bother the principal with every nickel-and-dime
issue,'' Allen said. ``But the school secretary _ she's the key.''

EDITORIAL: PROGRESS AND PAIN ON RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, July 16:
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a half-century ago, in his novel ``Invisible Man,'' Ralph
Ellison wrote of a society in which whites and blacks rarely
intersected in any meaningful way, in which black people simply did
not register in the majority consciousness, except as
one-dimensional stereotypes. Yet Ellison was both an optimist and
an integrationist, and he might have been pleased to see, in The
New York Times' six-week series on race in America, that this
nation is far removed from the separatist society that he recorded
in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   The 15th and final installment in that series is an
autobiographical narrative by Don Terry, a New York Times reporter,
which appears Sunday in an issue of the Sunday magazine devoted
entirely to race. The magazine uses the same journalistic technique
that marked the series as a whole _ inviting whites and blacks to
express their feelings about race in an uninhibited way. The
results are startling _ an outpouring of hopes and grievances that
add up to a sharp, contemporary picture of how whites and blacks
think about one another and themselves, and of how they actually
interact on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   These conversations would not have been possible, however, if
America had not advanced to a point where blacks and whites, unlike
the races in Ellison's day, could share the same spaces and many of
the same dreams and aspirations. America is now an inescapably
multiracial society in many of its schools, workplaces, churches,
cultural institutions and its military. In some articles in the
series, blacks and whites did not interact much at all, living
essentially parallel lives _ the white quarterback at the
predominantly black university, for example, or the two Cubans in
Miami, thrust into separate orbits by a racially divided city.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the pieces are rich with shared activity _ in the
public schools of Maplewood, N.J., in the Akron Beacon Journal
newsroom, on the set of an HBO series, in a tank battalion at Fort
Knox, at the Assembly of God Tabernacle in Atlanta. As a New York
Times poll on race suggested last week, these are not isolated
instances of social interaction. Though most Americans still do not
live or worship with those of other races, 76 percent of whites and
84 percent of blacks said they had close friends of another race,
and equally surprising numbers _ 43 percent of whites and 58
percent of blacks _ said people of a different race had visited
their homes socially in the last month.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also confirmed dispiriting aspects of the Times series.
Although whites seem more sensitive today to the realities of black
life than they were in Ellison's time, the two races seem to be
living on different planets on issues like fairness and equal
opportunity. By an overwhelming margin, for instance, blacks said
they were treated unfairly by the police, as opposed to only one in
four whites who thought blacks were treated unfairly. Four of 10
blacks thought they had the same economic opportunities as whites,
whereas 6 in 10 whites thought the playing field was now level.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike whites, blacks live with the consequences of America's
history of discrimination every day, which may help explain why
they seemed far more willing than whites to share their thoughts
with Times reporters. While many whites expressed fatigue with
racial issues, blacks like Charles Dutton, the angry director in
the story about the HBO series, seemed eager to discuss their
feelings with a liberating bluntness.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, President Clinton and both major presidential
candidates, George W. Bush and Al Gore, made pilgrimages to the
NAACP's annual meeting. Their appearances were a reminder that this
country's next leap forward in race relations must build upon but
also reach beyond the issues that moved America in the 1960s, when
bigotry was more nakedly expressed and civil rights advocates of
both races could focus their united energies on the legal barriers
to political and educational equality.
</P>
<P>
   Today's racial divide is more subtle, but it remains a
stubbornly persistent blend of remoteness, distrust and economic
inequality. Trust, perhaps, cannot be mandated. But as Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr. observed decades ago, shared prosperity and caring
communities are essential components of a healthy multiracial
society. One of the lessons of The Times' series is that this
message is as relevant at the start of the new American century as
it was in the early days of the civil rights revolution.

EDITORIAL: RAT FEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, July 16:
</P>
<P>
   When Joseph Mitchell wrote in 1944 that ``Rats are almost as
fecund as germs,'' he was getting at something profound about our
urban nightmares. We fear the creatures that proliferate wildly _
rats and cockroaches chiefly _ because to do so they must
proliferate unseen. No really hard numbers exist on the rat
population in New York City for that very reason. One of Mitchell's
sources, an exterminator, estimated that the number of rats in the
city had dropped from two per person around 1920 to one per person
in the early 1940s, largely because of a reduction in horses and
changes in construction. Since then, one rat per person in New York
has come to seem like gospel.
</P>
<P>
   A rat is a rumor until it is seen, and then it becomes a plague.
In the past few days, since the mayor proposed a rat task force
after rat sightings at Gracie Mansion, the number of eight or nine
rats per person has been batted around, without much foundation.
The higher estimate tells us nothing about the actual number of
rats in New York, but it does say something about the revulsion
rats cause. It also says something about the fear of what one might
call the unseen New York, the basements and tunnels, crawl spaces
and plumbing that abound in our built surroundings. The more you
live in the light, the more you fear the dark, though the opposite,
of course, is true of rats.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a shock from time to time, like seeing rats at Gracie
Mansion, to re-energize the task of rat control. From a low of
about 200 employees and a budget of $5 million in the early 1990s,
the Health Department's Pest Control Bureau has grown in size to
some 375 employees and a budget of about $13 million, closer to
what it was in the 1970s. Rats are supreme opportunists, and with
every slight change in the way humans handle garbage, there is a
change in the number of rats to handle it for us. Street collection
instead of incineration, plastic bags instead of garbage cans _
each of these changes has had an impact on the rat population.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that rats will always be with us does not mean we have
to like it. Although in the broader health picture they are a
nuisance, not a threat, their fleas carry the same diseases as they
always have, and rat bites are as dangerous as ever. But rats also
communicate something besides disease. ``Away from their nests,''
Mitchell wrote, rats ``are usually on the edge of hysteria,'' and
at the sight of them we tend to know just how they feel.

   COXNET FOCUS 0716: CLASSIC CARS, ANCIENT CITY _ The names come
out a little differently in Arabic. DeSoto becomes something like
``Tozata'' and Chrysler sounds like ``Kleezler.'' But those old
bombs you might find in an auto collector's garage in America make
for colorful and practical transportation in Syria. The country's
streets are flush with fins and crawling with chrome. Stroll the
centuries-old bazaars and you're likely to be passed not only your
father's Oldsmobile, but his father's before him. (Kaplow, Cox

Washington. ``Big Brown,'' as the company is commonly called, is
vying for a lucrative air route to China against another

   CREMATION _ ``It's an irreversible decision,'' Chet Robbins
advises me. Well, yes. To stretch this body out and bake it for two
hours at 1600 degrees reduces my decision-making powers, and me, to
about 4 pounds of crumbled bone. There goes the figure-skating
career... At the subject of cremation even Robbins, who as
executive director of the Texas Funeral Service Commission should
be used to this type of thing by now, clicks off the joviality and
turns a dour, professional gray. It wasn't so long ago, he says,
``People would have asked, `What's cremation?' '' Traditional
funerals, with embalming, caskets, religious services, and ground
burial in a family plot, weren't really matters of choice. They
were the rule. Not so today. More and more people are choosing to
be cremated at death. (Ardery, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.

OLD-TIME PAYBACK: DAUBACH PACES BOSTON
</HEADLINE>
  By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Brian Daubach spent seven full years in the New York
Mets' organization, and he played fewer than 20 games above
Double-A. He played for the Mets' replacement team during the
strike in 1995, and he had just over a year of major league service
entering this season.
</P>
<P>
   Daubach has not forgotten that the Mets never gave him a chance,
and the Mets have not forgotten his stint as a replacement player.
Mets catcher Todd Pratt felt insulted on Friday when he said
Daubach told him to ``save it'' during an argument. Pratt called
Daubach a ``scab.''
</P>
<P>
   Daubach, the Boston Red Sox' first baseman who beat the Mets
with a two-run double in the ninth inning Thursday, did not start
Saturday. He was inserted in the lineup only after Carl Everett,
another former Met, went out of control after being ejected in the
second inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox may lose Everett for a while _ he bumped the
home-plate umpire Ronald Kulpa twice during the confrontation _ but
they did not miss him Saturday. Daubach ripped a three-run home run
off Mets ace Mike Hampton to break a tie and help the Red Sox to a
6-4 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets rallied for two runs on four hits in the ninth inning,
but Derek Lowe fielded Melvin Mora's squibber and threw out Mora to
end the game.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth inning, with the score tied at 2-2, a runner on
second and one out, Hampton intentionally walked Nomar Garciaparra,
baseball's leading hitter, to get to Daubach. On the first pitch,
Daubach lifted a fly ball into the netting above the tall
left-field wall, his 15th homer and just the second allowed by
Hampton in his last seven starts.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton (9-6) worked seven innings, allowing six runs (five
earned) on eight hits and two walks. Ramon Martinez pitched six
solid innings to earn the victory for Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The game concluded an eventful three-game series that featured
three homers by Mike Piazza _ including a bases-empty shot in the
ninth inning Saturday _ a near brawl on Friday, an ejection of
Dennis Cook on Friday and Everett Saturday, and two Red Sox
victories. The Mets traveled to Toronto after the game to face the
Blue Jays, the second team they visit on a four-city, 11-game road
trip.
</P>
<P>
   Cook was ejected for hitting Everett on Friday, and afterward
Cook stated a fact: Everett crowds the plate. The Mets accept that,
and even admire it in a way. ``I've never seen a hitter on that
much of the plate,'' Pratt said. ``That's just more respect for
him, because he can handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   The plate umpire, also noticed. During Everett's first at-bat
Saturday, leading off the second, Kulpa pointed at the dirt at the
back of the batter's box, indicating where Everett should stand.
</P>
<P>
   Everett was incensed and shouted at Kulpa, who ejected him. Five
minutes of histrionics followed: Everett slammed his helmet to the
ground, bumped chests with Kulpa, then knocked his head into
Kulpa's as he screamed in the umpire's face.
</P>
<P>
   Kulpa staggered back, and as the other umpires gathered around
him, Everett's eruption continued. He shoved aside the first-base
coach, Tommy Harper, who with manager Jimy Williams was trying to
restrain him. Everett pointed repeatedly at the back of the
batter's box, and he would not leave the home-plate area.
</P>
<P>
   Things got so wild that Mets right fielder Derek Bell, a
teammate of Everett's in Houston last year, jogged in to try to
calm Everett down. Mets manager Bobby Valentine intercepted Bell
before he got to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Everett finally retreated to the dugout, where he tossed bats
and water coolers. He has much more than an equipment fine coming
his way: for bumping an umpire _ twice _ Everett will most likely
probably be reprimanded severely.
</P>
<P>
   While the Mets played, their regular third baseman, Robin
Ventura, was in New York having a magnetic resonance imaging test
performed on his ailing right shoulder. Results were not
immediately available, but Ventura seems likely to miss at least a
few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not in the lineup, and he won't be in the lineup for a
while,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Franco played third base Saturday, and Valentine said he
``could get a lot of playing time.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine was clear on one thing: Todd Zeile will not move back
to third, where he played for the last several years. Zeile has
been contributing consistently at first base after some initial
adjustments to his new position. Since May 26, Zeile has committed
only one error, on the interference call with Chuck Knoblauch
running last week.
</P>
<P>
   He has made two standout defensive plays this series. On
Thursday, he dived to his left in the eighth inning to turn a
potential extra-base hit into an out, saving a run. Saturday, Zeile
came in to field a slow roller by Darren Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   With Hampton sprinting to first for the throw, Zeile had no time
to transfer the ball to his hand, so he shoveled it to Hampton from
his glove for the out.  &QL;

   NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y. _ Juli Inkster's biggest decision Saturday,
like that of many parents, was what to do with her two young
daughters on a rainy Saturday afternoon in the New York
metropolitan area. Inkster, the winner of three major championships
over the past 19 months, had plenty of time on her hands because
the third round of the Japan Airlines Big Apple Classic had been
postponed by heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
   Should the children continue to play with the four sons of Frank
and Lynnie Mara, with whom Inkster and her family have been staying
in Port Chester, or should they venture into Manhattan to a museum?
</P>
<P>
   The decision: Let the kids draw up a storm with acrylic paints
on glass while Inkster and the Maras _ Frank Mara is the son of the
Giants co-owner Wellington Mara _ joined in the fun. Later, Inkster
and her daughters, Hayley Carol, 10, and Cori Simpson, 6, were to
have dinner in Manhattan in Little Italy and then see the hit
musical ``Swing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Me and the girls are having a great time,'' said Inkster, who
marked her 40th birthday by winning the McDonald's LPGA
Championship, one of the circuit's four majors, for the second year
in a row on June 25. ``We have dinner together every night and are
getting to see some of the sights. I love having them with me.''
</P>
<P>
   The role of working mom seems to suit Inkster fine. Her
daughters sometimes accompany her to tournaments, as was the case
at the McDonald's, the sixth major she has won. ``I'm even going to
take them to the British and Swedish Opens this summer,'' said
Inkster who will be the defending champion when the U.S. Women's
Open, begins Thursday in Libertyville, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   First, though, Inkster would like to win her second Big Apple
Classic _ she was a wire-to-wire winner in 1992 _ when the
tournament resumes, weather permitting, on Sunday morning at
Wykagyl Country Club. That will be a daunting task, however,
because Inkster, at 1-over 143, trails the second-round leader,
Allison Finney, by 10 strokes. Annika Sorenstam is in second place,
one stroke behind Finney.
</P>
<P>
   Inkster, Sorenstam and Karrie Webb have come to dominate women's
golf, but they have also given the LPGA keen competition at its
highest level. Webb, 25, and Sorenstam, 29, have both won four
tournaments this year. Inkster has won twice. Inkster has 24 career
titles, Sorenstam 22 and Webb 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly try to keep up with them, but I don't see myself
involved in any kind of rivalry with Annika and Karrie,'' Inkster
said. ``After all, we're from two different eras; they're in their
20s, and I'm 40.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but Inkster is in the top three with Webb and
Sorenstam in several statistical categories on the LPGA circuit _
scoring average, rounds under par, top-10 finishes, earnings and
the race for player of the year. In three categories _ scoring
average, rounds under par and top-10 finishes _ Inkster leads
Sorenstam while trailing Webb.
</P>
<P>
   Inkster, who is outgoing, witty and not afraid to show her
emotions on the course, could hardly be more different in
personality than the cool, analytical Sorenstam, who won
back-to-back U.S. Opens in 1995 and 1996, and the equally low-key
Webb, who has captured two majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we're playing together _ and I like it when Annika and
Karrie are in the field with me _ I feel I have as good a shot as
they do to win,'' said Inkster who is one of only two women (Pat
Bradley is the other) to win the modern-day career Grand Slam. ``I
think it brings out the best in me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But nowadays, with my daughters and my husband, who travels
with me to some of my tournaments, golf has become secondary,''
Inkster said. ``I still work as hard as ever and I would love to
win another Open. If anything, it's easier when I have the girls
along because they take my mind off of my golf, and I'm more
relaxed when I play. That wasn't the case when I was a young
player. We have a lot of fun together, and when I'm with them I
totally forget about golf.''

BARAK, ARAFAT STAY UP LATE FOR THIRD MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ For only the third time since the start of the
Middle East peace talks, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat met face to face, staying up until
1 a.m. Saturday in a meeting with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat reportedly had threatened to leave the summit the night
before, but by Friday night, negotiations appeared to have resumed
_ or so it seemed by the few details released by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   After the Jewish Sabbath began at sundown Friday, the three
leaders gathered for a traditional Sabbath meal at Barak's
invitation. They sat at a large table; the meal began with a
blessing and a song that was a ``blessing for the angels of
peace,'' National Security Council spokesman P.J. Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
   After dinner, the three men met, joined only by translators and
note takers, officials said. It was the second three-way meeting of
the talks. Earlier in the week, Arafat and Barak also had met
without Clinton present.
</P>
<P>
   While officials kept to their self-imposed news blackout,
sources within the negotiation teams told Reuters that the talks
Saturday were supposed to focus on economic elements of a potential
accord.
</P>
<P>
   But any proposal _ indeed, any peace agreement _ would almost
certainly have to be presented before Wednesday, when Clinton is
scheduled to depart for the Group of Eight economic summit in
Japan. White House officials have said they would not expect the
Mideast leaders to remain at Camp David after the US president
leaves.
</P>
<P>
   But Gadi Baltiansky, a spokesman for Barak, told Israeli radio
he could see the talks extending.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any problem from our point of view, if there is a
need to stay here another three or four days so that there will be
a deal,'' Baltiansky said.

 &HT;    Rhome doesn't rebuild QBs in a day
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ Jerry Rhome has a hideous jump shot.
</P>
<P>
   He pulls the basketball deliberately around past his ear, way
back, and lets fly _ falling back _ from directly above his head.
</P>
<P>
   It ain't pretty, but the shot's history is like a window into
the style of the Falcons' new quarterbacks coach.
</P>
<P>
   Rhome, a hoops nut, is 57, slow off the dribble, short (about
5-feet-10), and can't jump a lick.
</P>
<P>
   So . . . ``I found myself playing with players all the time,''
he said. ``Players love to stuff coaches. I tried to develop a shot
that'd be harder to block. I saw a few guys (i.e. former Seattle
forward Jack Sikma) shoot the ball further back, and I said,
`There's a thought.' ''
</P>
<P>
   There's vintage Rhome, always looking for an edge, a way to
compensate or overcome.
</P>
<P>
   The guy's itinerent, coaching with Seattle, Washington, San
Diego, Dallas, Arizona, Minnesota, Houston and St. Louis since
1976.
</P>
<P>
   But he gets results. See former students Jim Zorn, Dave Krieg,
Joe Theismann, Mark Rypien, Doug Williams, Troy Aikman, Steve
Beuerlein, Warren Moon and Kurt Warner for proof.
</P>
<P>
   Think a howitzer arm is all you need to be a good NFL
quarterback?
</P>
<P>
   Chris Chandler thought that way until he ran into Rhome in '91,
after the Bucs released him, and Arizona picked him up.
</P>
<P>
   Rhome began changing Chandler's mind the next offseason,
challenging him to basketball, golf, billiards, poker and . . .
passing games.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the bullheaded QB was cooing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it weren't for `Rock,' I'd probably be in a cheese line,''
Chandler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes you understand why defenses do the things they do,''
Chandler said. ``He's a great teacher. It's one thing to say, `Look
to that receiver first, that one second, and that one third.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He teaches you to get around the first two steps by reading
coverages. That helps you make quicker decisions, makes you more
accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhome explains.
</P>
<P>
   ``People forget that when you look at film, you're 100 feet
tall,'' he said. ``When you're playing, you're 6-2 or whatever.
Watching film, you're looking down, you can stop it, rewind it,
slow it down; there's no pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``But . . . on the field, it's like being behind trees with that
pass rush. You got to have a security blanket.
</P>
<P>
   ``The blanket is to key the defense, key certain defenders, key
certain areas to know what the defense is doing so you know before
you start doing it what you're going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early '60s, before the explosion of TV, fans learned of
an undersized Tulsa quarterback because his name kept appearing in
newspaper agate next to 300, 400, 500 yards of passing offense
after every game.
</P>
<P>
   Rhome set 17 NCAA passing records, and was runner-up in '64 to
Navy's Roger Staubach in Heisman Trophy voting.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons coach Dan Reeves met Rhome up close.
</P>
<P>
   In '65, they were rookie roommates with the Cowboys _ one a high
draft choice, Reeves an undrafted college quarterback becoming a
running back.
</P>
<P>
   Both got by on brains.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was extremely accurate,'' Reeves said. ``He didn't have the
strongest arm, wasn't blessed with a lot of physical ability, but
made up for it with mental ability.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler is ecstatic to have back his Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve Danny Kanell is smiling, too.
</P>
<P>
   After joining the team last year, he was dreadful in the
preseason while re-learning an offense that had evolved since he
played for Reeves as a rookie with the Giants in '96.
</P>
<P>
   Some Falcons officials recently theorized privately that part of
the reason was that former quarterbacks coach Steve DeBerg _ whom
Reeves said was fired in part for lack of professionalism _ didn't
work well, or at all, with Kanell.
</P>
<P>
   After playing for the Falcons in '98, at age 44, DeBerg wanted
to play again in '99.
</P>
<P>
   The team instead signed Kanell, who took DeBerg's preferred
position _ in uniform behind Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just different. I don't want to say anything bad about
anybody,'' Kanell said. ``I really like (Rhome's) personality; I
think he's going to mold well with the guys we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanell is learning quickly, when with Rhome do as Rhome does.
</P>
<P>
   ``His strengths are . . . the finer points of being a
quarterback, reading defenses, when to try to fit a ball in and
when not to. Decision-making is his strong suit.''

<P>
   BRIANCON, France _ Lance Armstrong was in a relaxed mood as he
stepped off the podium Saturday to commemorate his fifth straight
day in the famed yellow jersey of the Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
   And why not.
</P>
<P>
   With the biggest test of the Tour behind him _ he and the rest
of the ever-shrinking main pack had just finished a 154-mile trek
through the southern Alps _ it appears that his lead over Germany's
Jan Ullrich was a stable one with a week left of racing before the
finish at the Champs Elysees in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong still was without a stage victory, finishing seventh
in Saturday's stage 14 from Draguigan to Briancon, the highest city
in France. With none of the overall contenders ahead of him,
Armstrong was content to allow Colombian Santiago Botero to claim
this intense mountain stage.
</P>
<P>
   Botero, who waved both hands skyward, then clinched his chest in
celebration, crossed the finish line in 7 hours, 56 minutes, 13
seconds. Armstrong finished 2:51 behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's overall time of 61 hours, 2 minutes, 33 seconds
still was 4:55 better than Ullrich, the 1997 Tour champion. The
German finished with the same time as Armstrong on Saturday,
although he crossed the finish line two places behind him. Joseba
Boleki, a Spaniard riding for the French team Festina, was third
overall, 5:52 behind Armstrong. Two French riders _ Christophe
Moreau and Richard Virenque _ occupied the fourth and fifth spots,
6:51 and 8:26 in back of Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong was in such an upbeat mood that he joked with members
of the European press. His relationship with the reporters,
especially the French ones, until Saturday had been strained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I look bad?'' Armstrong replied, when asked if he was
tired after the stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seriously, it was a long day, a hard day. There was a lot of
wind, but that's nothing new to this Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a hard day for everybody. It was a long time to be on a
bike. Probably too long.''
</P>
<P>
   The group of riders started at 9:30 a.m. and did not get to
Briancon until after 5. Temperatures on this picture-perfect day
were more crisp than cold, as they had been in the two previous
mountain stages. Instead of rain, fog and wintry conditions, the
cyclists were greeted with blue skies and temperatures near 60.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong rode at an almost casual pace, with his U.S. Postal
Service teammates, including Austinite Kevin Livingston, closely
guarding their leader at the front of the peloton, or main group.
By the final climb, Armstrong had left his teammates to join the
group chasing Botero. But he did not press to catch the Colombian.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's strategy allowed Botero to accomplish what he called
his biggest feat as a cyclist. He is the first Colombian to win a
stage in four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colombia is experiencing a very serious crisis right now,''
said Botero, the lone rider from his country still in the Tour.
``I'm happy to have brought a positive note to this crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Armstrong could be the first overall Tour champion
not to have won a stage on the way to Paris since American Greg
LeMond won in 1990. Armstrong won four last year _ the prologue,
two individual time trials and the first mountain stage. He has
finished second four times this Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job is to keep the jersey,'' Armstrong said. ``When
there's a breakaway, and the riders are 20 or 30 minutes behind, it
doesn't effect the overall standings. It's easier to stay together
as a team if we all ride together.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Gorski, the general manager of Team Postal, said ``it would
have made no sense for Lance to have tried to win today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Seventh place absolutely is wonderful,'' Gorski said. ``It's
exactly where he needed to be. Why should he have expended energy
today to try to win the stage, when he'll need the energy tomorrow.
Stage wins are irrelevant.''

THE ``PLAYMAKER'' EXPOUNDS ON RETIREMENT AND MORE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He had just retired, and now former Cowboys receiver Michael
Irvin took off his shoes, put up his feet and relaxed on a couch in
the green room at the Fox Sports studios in the Las Colinas area of
Irving, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   As he loosened the tie on his mustard suit ensemble and leaned
his head back, Irvin quipped to his interviewer, ``Man, you are
going to have to talk to me like one of those doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   A whirlwind day, which marked the end of Irvin's illustrious and
controversial 12-year football career, finally was starting to wind
down.
</P>
<P>
   And Irvin, whose final four years were nothing like his first
eight on or off the field, was ready to let go.
</P>
<P>
   Formerly affable and ubiquitous, Irvin had grown reserved and
mistrusting following a 1996 felony drug conviction. He still could
be outgoing and engaging at times, but he was a hermit compared
with his larger-than-life image during the height of the Cowboys'
run to Super Bowl titles in 1992, 1993 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin said the threat of a 20-year prison term if he violated
his four years of probation caused the change. So did the fears of
being at the mercy of others, like the inventors of fraudulent rape
charges. As a result, Irvin felt confined in his own mental prison
the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Irvin was not able to find the solace on the field as he
did in the past. A bad relationship with former Cowboys coach Chan
Gailey the past two years had the team's all-time leading receiver
contemplating retirement even before the neck injury that forced
him from the game was discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Following his retirement announcement Wednesday, ``The
Playmaker'' expounded on these and other issues to
``Star-Telegram'' staff writer Clarence E. Hill Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Q: This a bittersweet day because you didn't want to leave the
game. But this is a good time in your life for another reason. You
fulfilled the terms of your four-year probation last week and now
you are a free man again. In many ways, it's a new beginning for
you.
</P>
<P>
   A: It feels great to be off probation. I got that monkey off my
back. That probation was a monkey. I'm looking forward to starting
fresh. Let's see what I can make out of it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was the hardest part for you?
</P>
<P>
   A: The toughest part was knowing that I wasn't going to be able
to control a great deal of things. There are many issues and things
I worry about that could have went down that I had no control over,
and I was subject to doing 20 years over. I worried about that
every day. There's nothing more frightening than knowing that
something could happen today that could send you to prison for 20
years. I promise you it was scary. So I'm glad it's done.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Many people would find it hard to believe that the Michael
Irvin who defied the establishment by wearing a fur coat in the
courtroom was scared about anything. Specifically, what frightened
you the most?
</P>
<P>
   A: I worried about some nut out there in the world slipping
something into my drink, and I'm taking all those NFL drug tests. I
was worried about somebody saying I did something to them or
setting them up. And I had no grounds to fight back. I worried from
that standpoint. It was just scary.
</P>
<P>
   You'd sit around and things would pop up and you were like, ``I
wasn't there. I don't know anything about that.'' It's then that
you realize just how fragile this probation thing can be. You
realize how one little thing can mean 20 years for you. You start
saying, ``I'm going to watch what I do and watch where I go.'' But
then you realize it ain't just me. I can do all those things and it
still might not work out for me. That's scary. You can't control
all of that. I had to develop the attitude that no matter what
happened, if I was around it or anywhere near it, I was guilty.
That's scary.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did you cope?
</P>
<P>
   A: Honestly, I did a hell of a lot better job the last four
years than I did before or I wouldn't be in this situation. First
of all, I definitely tried to watch where I was and who I was with.
In all seriousness, I would joke when I was leaving places with my
wife and my boys. If I was leaving around 10 or 11 at night, I
would yell out, ``Excuse me, but would somebody make a note that
I'm leaving the restaurant at 11 p.m.'' People would start
laughing, thinking that's just Michael being Michael. And I would
say, ``We can laugh but somebody will make a note because I said
it.'' It brought that kind of reality for me.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You had to learn then what the NFL is trying to teach the
younger players in light of the Ray Lewis murder trial about
watching who you hang out with. What advice do you have for them in
avoiding what happened to you?
</P>
<P>
   A: First of all, they need to stay out of trouble and do the
right thing in the first place. But they also need to watch who
they hang with. And that's a hard thing on a young
African-American, a young brother. ... You grew up with a lot of
those people. As a man you don't want to feel like you are turning
your back on people that helped you, or people that you grew up
with and people that came from the same situation you came from. It
really is a fine line you have to walk. I was scared to go back
home and deal with some people because I knew the situation that
could happen. So I just chose not to go back home, instead of
telling people I couldn't hang out with them. I couldn't put myself
in that situation.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You were on top of the world before all this. Well, you
certainly owned Dallas. After the conviction, you lost everything,
money, image and friends. You have to have some regrets?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sure, I'd be lying if didn't. It would be great if it never
happened. But it's still great. I don't call it regrets, though.
It's during those moments that you find out so much. We always
yearn to know what's real in our life, who's real in our life and
who loves and why they love us. I found out a lot about those
people. I lost a great deal with what I went through. I lost a lot
emotionally. I lost a lot financially. I lost a great deal.
</P>
<P>
   But I'm blessed that my wife Saudi didn't go anywhere, she sees
greater things. I'm blessed that way. That's a blessing because I
found out who's there for real. You go through your life now with
people who you know love you. I'm sorry to the people I hurt. I
have said it before, I said it a 100 times. You can never say it
enough. I don't know if people will ever forget it. They shouldn't.
It is my reality. But it is behind me. Thank God I'm here and have
something to look forward to and start over.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What you did was wrong. However, some people did things that
perhaps were worse. Former Rams cornerback Darryl Henley is in
prison now for drug trafficking. Former Chiefs running back Bam
Morris is awaiting trial on a similar charge, as is former Cowboys
running Sherman Williams. Former Cowboys linebacker Thomas
Henderson admitted to using drugs in the Super Bowl. Yet you were
considered the poster child for today's bad-boy athletes. Was that
fair?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, I'm the bad boy. That's how people look at me. But the
reality is those guys haven't carried the weight I carried, with
Super Bowls, publicity and the things I've accomplished. They
haven't benefited the way I benefited from those things. When I got
suspended, a letter came from Mr. (Paul) Tagliabue, the NFL
commissioner, saying the regular suspensions would have been this.
But since I played for the Cowboys and me being who I am I got to
get this greater suspension. I didn't understand it then, but I
understand it now.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The past two years were tough on you on the field. You were
the subject of trade talks before last season and even went into
training camp with the threat of the Cowboys possibly cutting you
if you didn't accept the role Chan Gailey had planned. How did that
experience affect your love for the game and your decision to
retire?
</P>
<P>
   A: You know, part of me still wants to play. It would be nice to
play with a new coach. But the way things went on with me the last
couple of years made it easier for me to leave the game. Let me say
it this way: I'm a guy built on loyalty. My game is played on
loyalty. I give loyalty to the guys I played with and the guys I
played for. When I go on the field I give them all I got and they
give me back loyalty. Once I receive back less than what I gave,
when we are talking about loyalty, it takes away from what I give
you on the football field. That's the best way I can put it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What type of team do you the think the Cowboys will have
without you?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think they will be fine. They are fast team. The object was
to improve speed on offense and they did that. I'll put Joey
Galloway and Rocket Ismail in a two-man race against anybody in the
league. The Cowboys are going to be fine. Dave Campo was a great
hire. And I'm going to be rooting for them.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Beyond playing the game, what will you miss the most?
</P>
<P>
   A: Playing with Emmitt (Smith) and Troy (Aikman). There's
nothing like those two guys. We had such an appreciation and love
for one another. I don't think we understand how special we were
together. But what we did and what kind of team we three were
together, that was a blessing. It was special.'' nn

MASRY RETURNS TO PRACTICE - ON TV
</HEADLINE>
 
(Removing references to Christopher Darden.) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECILIA CHAN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. _ Westlake Village attorney Edward Masry sat
patiently as the makeup artist at Empire Studios dabbed on
foundation and powder and trimmed his gray eyebrows and sideburns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want you to be confused,'' said Masry, known to
moviegoers as the real-life boss in the recent film ``Erin
Brockovich.''
</P>
<P>
   ``About?'' the woman asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``That I'm Tom Cruise,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   Portrayed by actor Albert Finney in this year's Julia Roberts
blockbuster, Masry is now starring in his own courtroom drama.
``Power of Attorney'' - sort of a cross between ``Judge Judy'' and
``L.A. Law'' - debuts Aug. 28, featuring high-profile attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   For Masry, 67, it was the first time in a decade that he was
back in the courtroom. After suffering a heart attack while arguing
a 1990 case in federal court, his wife made him promise to leave
the trial work to others.
</P>
<P>
   But in his new half-hour show, Masry and a corps of 22 other
attorneys will represent clients in misdemeanor and civil cases
heard by former New Jersey Judge Andrew P. Napolitano, who will
issue binding decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am doing this because people don't understand the role we
attorneys play in life,'' said Masry, of Thousand Oaks. ``I think
it's good for them to have a program like this. This is as close to
realism as they can get here.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way I miss the courtroom. I am looking forward to it.
It's a challenge,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Masry was selected for the show from a pool of 40 attorneys,
most of whom were chosen after a test shot. The partner in Masry &AMP;
Vittitoe, however, didn't have to go through a tryout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed was one of the few people we did not test,'' said John
Rizzotti, a spokesman for Twentieth Century Television, a division
of Fox, which is producing the show. ``We felt confident enough he
could handle himself in front of the camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``After `Erin Brockovich,' he was bombarded by the press and he
handled himself well in interviews, travel and speaking
abilities,'' Rizzotti said.
</P>
<P>
   During a taping early Friday, Masry went head-to-head against
Boston attorney Wendy Murphy in a civil dispute between two
sisters.
</P>
<P>
   Masry represented Jessica, who was suing her sister for $5,000
for damage to her truck. Murphy represented Rachel, the defendant,
who admitted she accidentally crashed the truck, but didn't think
she should have to pay because the vehicle was uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   After some feisty exchanges, tears and objections raised by both
sides, Napolitano awarded $5,000 to Masry's client.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the studio's Green Room, Masry critically assessed his
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really rusty,'' he said. ``It's been 10 years since I've
been in a courtroom. I felt it. It took me awhile to start to get
back into it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Murphy gave high praise to Masry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt he did a great job,'' she said. ``Obviously, he is
experienced and he is someone I admire.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is an icon in the legal community and a hero. I've always
admired him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, of course, I loved `Erin Brockovich.'''
</P>
<P>
   The movie, which has grossed more than $120 million, starred
Roberts as Brockovich, a fledging file clerk who with Masry, waged
a legal battle against Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric Co. The duo won a
record $333 million settlement for residents in the High Desert
town of Hinkley, Calif., after determining the utility had
contaminated the water supply.
</P>
<P>
   ```Erin Brockovich' made him,'' Rizzotti said. ``I mean, taking
into consideration that Ed is an exceptional lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In law circles he was fairly well known, but the nation did
not know him until `Erin Brockovich' came out,'' Rizzotti said.
``We are putting him back in front of the camera so his 15 minutes
of fame is not over yet.''
</P>
<P>
   And although his face has been plastered all over television,
newspapers and magazines such as ``People,'' the notoriety hasn't
gone to his head, said Joey Masry, who accompanied her husband of
10 years to the first taping.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the same,'' she said. ``He's a workaholic. In the car
he's on the phone, in the house he's on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1975, I've gone with him and have seen him in papers and
on TV,'' she said. ``This is a little more publicity, but I am used
to him being a public figure.''
</P>
<P>
   Masry also said fame hasn't changed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still that good-looking, attractive, handsome young man,''
he said with a grin.

LEWIS, DEFEATING BOTHA, RETAINS TITLES 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ With a brutal left-right, left-right combination,
Lennox Lewis retained his World Boxing Council and International
Boxing Federation heavyweight titles Saturday night with a
second-round knockout of Frans Botha.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is 37-1-1 with 29 knockouts. Botha is 40-3-1 with 24
knockouts but has been stopped three times _ by Michael Moorer,
Mike Tyson and now Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by music from the movie ``Rocky,'' Botha arrived in
the ring wrapped in what appeared to be a white buffalo skin,
befitting his ``White Buffalo'' nickname. When he disrobed, the
skin was unceremoniously dumped on the concrete floor below the
steps to his corner where American and South African flags waved.
</P>
<P>
   More than four minutes later, Lewis, without a robe but preceded
by a flagbearer with the Union Jack, slowly paraded to the ring
under a veil of smoke and orange spotlights.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the cautious first round, Lewis staggered Botha
with an overhand right to his blond goatee. The South African, who
now lives in Newport Beach, Calif., quickly regained his footing
but kept moving backward, more intent on defense than on throwing
any serious punches.
</P>
<P>
   In the second, that left-right, left-right combination by Lewis
put Botha through the ropes in Lewis' corner. Botha crawled back
into the ring but the referee, Larry O'Connell, waved his arms
after 2 minutes 39 seconds of the round.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell, incidentally, was the judge who scored the debatable
draw between Lewis and Evander Holyfield early last year at Madison
Square Garden in New York City. When he was announced as the
referee Saturday night at the London Arena, he was booed by the
estimated crowd of 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very special to come back home and show the people how
much I've improved,'' said Lewis, alluding to his first fight in
London since being knocked out by Oliver McCall in 1994. ``It was a
good stoppage by the referee. When the referee asked him to come
forward, he was still wobbly.''
</P>
<P>
   Before and after Saturday night's title fight, Mike Tyson hung
on the horizon with the charm of an approaching thunderstorm.
</P>
<P>
   When Lewis was asked after Saturday night's knockout if he had a
message for Tyson, the champion said, ``Tell Mike to either put up
or shut up.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson was reportedly in Phoenix, his latest home in a long line
of homes from Brooklyn to upstate New York correctional addresses
to Catskill, N.Y., to New Jersey to Ohio to an Indiana prison to
Connecticut to Las Vegas to Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Lewis has a mandatory IBF title defense scheduled
against David Tua of New Zealand in November (possibly in Toronto),
Lewis has acknowledged that Tyson might be a future opponent.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted Frank Bruno, once Britain's heavyweight pride who
is still more popular than Lewis, to warn Lewis that he ``better
watch out'' for the former heavyweight champion, who leveled Lou
Savarese in 38 seconds three weeks ago in Glasgow. And that
provoked Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is this guy talking about?'' Lewis has been saying.
``This is the same geezer who turned into a statue in the ring
against Tyson. And he's telling me to watch out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not go in there and fight Tyson the way he did and go
in looking the way he did beforehand, when he kept making signs of
the cross. I don't think that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson dethroned Bruno as the WBC heavyweight champion in Bruno's
first defense of that title, in 1996. The Jamaica-born Bruno had
won the WBC title from Oliver McCall and in 1994 Lewis, then an
undefeated heavyweight on the rise, stopped Bruno in the seventh
round at Wembley.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter where or when Lewis fights Tyson, it is doubtful
the bout would be anywhere in Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson is more persona non grata than ever in Britain after two
farcical appearances _ a second-round knockout of the incompetent
Julius Francis in London on Jan. 29, and the ridiculously quick
knockout of Savarese when Tyson pushed the referee to the canvas
and later snarled on television that he wanted to rip out Lewis'
heart and eat the champion's children.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, Lewis, still a bachelor at 34, has no children.
</P>
<P>
   For all of Tyson's talk about wanting to fight Lewis, he also
acknowledged that he was not ready for a title bout, that he needed
two or three more fights to sharpen his punches. His next opponent
is expected to be Andrew Golota, the Polish heavyweight with a
history of below-the-belt punches _ the perfect lighted match to
toss into the Tyson powder keg.

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Voter apathy growing
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service Voters are more disengaged in the
<TEXT>
presidential race this year than at any time in recent history,
according to a recent survey of American attitudes towards
politics. Good economic times and a sense that there is little
difference between Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush
has lulled voters into ``a rather pleasant sleep,'' pollster Andrew
Kohut of the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press said
Friday.
<P>
   The poll found that only 46 percent of registered voters said
they have thought a lot about the election, down from 55 percent in
1996 and 63 percent in the same period in 1992. Low interest was
especially found in young and middle-age voters. Flagging voter
interest could result in record low voter turnout this fall, Kohut
said.
</P>
<P>
   NETWORKS IFFY ON COVERAGE
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's farewell address to his fellow Democrats at
next month's party convention in Los Angeles might not be broadcast
by the major TV networks. NBC News last week released a plan that
calls for only two and a half hours of coverage for each convention
on its last two nights. NBC plans to air Clinton's Aug. 14
scheduled address on sister station MSNBC. Meanwhile, ABC is
planning to televise a preseason football game on the night a
two-term president who survived impeachment bids adieu to his
party. CBS this week is expected to announce its coverage plans.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's speech is expected to be carried on PBS, CNN, MSNBC,
Fox News and C-Span.
</P>
<P>
   NADER AND VENTURA MEET
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Nader and Jesse Ventura got together Friday to commiserate
about how tough it is to get money, recognition and ballot space
for a third party. Nader, the Green Party presidential candidate,
and Ventura, the Minnesota governor, met for nearly an hour in the
governor's office in St. Paul.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very clear what happens whenever a third-party movement
begins to gain strength. The two major parties come together and do
whatever they can to squash that third party,'' said Ventura, who
now carries the banner of the Independence Party. They talked about
getting better ballot access for third parties and lowering the
cutoff from 15 percent to 5 percent support for allowing candidates
into national debates.
</P>
<P>
   GOP TO HONOR TEAMSTER
</P>
<P>
   Republicans plan to hold a reception honoring Teamsters
president James P. Hoffa on July 31, the first night of their
party's Philadelphia convention. The announcement Thursday by Jim
Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National Committee,
underlined the Republicans' desire to win support from the
1.4-million-member Teamsters union, which Gore has heavily courted.
Nicholson said this would be the first time in at least 20 years
that the Republicans have held a convention reception for a union
president.

 &HT;    Summer wonderland
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Only one matter is certain.
</P>
<P>
   The team that opens training camp Monday in Wichita Falls has
had a radical face lift. These aren't the Cowboys that sputtered to
an 8-8 record in 1999 and bowed out of the playoffs after a week.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to keep up with the free-spending Washington Redskins,
the Cowboys quietly made some heady moves of their own this spring.
They have welcomed a new coach, a high-profile reserve quarterback,
two linebackers who might start immediately, a tight end with Super
Bowl experience, one of the NFL's fastest wide receivers and three
rookie cornerbacks who hope to be more than camp fodder.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the Cowboys are deeper at positions that gave
them fits last season. Owner Jerry Jones hasn't made this many
off-season moves during his 12 years in Dallas. He reasoned that
the Cowboys needed an overhaul before their once-powerful engine
died of natural causes.
</P>
<P>
   Without these changes, there is no way Dallas would contend with
the hated Redskins, whose talent pool makes them the favorites to
win the NFC East.
</P>
<P>
   How good are the Cowboys? No one knows for sure, but the goal is
to improve on last season's 8-8 record and be one game better than
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   HERE ARE 10 QUESTIONS THEY HOPE TO ANSWER DURING CAMP:
</P>
<P>
   Is Dave Campo the right man to be head coach?
</P>
<P>
   He already has been endorsed by the players, which gives him an
edge over his predecessor. Campo, who turns 53 on Tuesday, has been
a loyal assistant since 1989, the year Jones bought the team. The
former defensive coordinator has been given credit for much of the
team's success during the Super Bowl years.
</P>
<P>
   Some have questioned whether Campo will be a ``puppet'' for
Jones, an idea that makes both men bristle. Jones, as owner and
general manager, has a right to be involved in every personnel
matter, and Campo understands this.
</P>
<P>
   Campo is not an egomaniac _ remember Jimmy Johnson? _ and does
not command attention or credit. After 11 years as a respected
assistant, he deserves a chance to be the boss. It's up to Jones to
give him some breathing room.
</P>
<P>
   Will an offense that ranked 16th in the NFL last season improve?
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the Cowboys, particularly quarterback Troy
Aikman, will be more comfortable this year. Aikman has had a good
relationship with new offensive coordinator Jack Reilly and new
team adviser Ernie Zampese, who ran the offense from 1994 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman struggled for two years in Chan Gailey's offensive
system. Reilly and Zampese will run an offense that helped Dallas
win three Super Bowls. That's when Emmitt Smith ran between the
offensive tackles, Aikman's timing passes were on the money and the
offensive line relied on man-on-man blocking.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey's zone blocking and dump-off passes did not exploit the
Cowboys' strengths. If Aikman believes he has five good years left,
this is the time to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Who will anchor the defense?
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys hope it's defensive end Greg Ellis, whose '99 season
ended when he broke his leg in December. He has progressed quicker
than expected, though. He was scheduled to begin running in July
but was running in minicamp in May.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis is a borderline All-Pro who has become the most consistent
defensive lineman in Dallas. The Cowboys did not have enough depth
to replace him when he got hurt seven months ago, one reason they
faded down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Another player the Cowboys are banking on is veteran Leon Lett,
who improved his bench-press from 405 pounds to 500 pounds in the
off-season. With Alonzo Spellman and Chad Hennings back, the
defensive line is one of the team's strengths.
</P>
<P>
   Can anyone replace Deion Sanders?
</P>
<P>
   Ryan McNeil, please take a bow. No one expects the eight-year
pro to match Prime Time's overall game, but McNeil is no slouch. He
was the No. 1 pick of the Detroit Lions in the 1993 draft and also
spent time in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   McNeil and veteran Kevin Smith are beyond their prime years, so
the Cowboys selected three cornerbacks in the draft. Dwayne
Goodrich, Kareem Larrimore and Mario Edwards will get plenty of
camp work.
</P>
<P>
   At safety, George Teague and Darren Woodson provide a talented
safety blanket when the cornerbacks get beat.
</P>
<P>
   Will the Cowboys have a proven place-kicker in camp?
</P>
<P>
   Probably not. Richie Cunningham was cut during the '99 season
after getting off to a bad start and will not be invited back.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Steve Hoffman has an uncanny knack for finding
high-quality kickers few have heard of.
</P>
<P>
   Remember Chris Boniol?
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys will have some rookies try out for the job, but it
will not be a surprise if they sign someone cut by another team.
</P>
<P>
   You never know when ancient Eddie Murray will get an emergency
call.
</P>
<P>
   What do the Cowboys expect from Dat Nguyen?
</P>
<P>
   More than most people realize. Nguyen, who bench-presses an
incredible 500 pounds, will be the starting linebacker when camp
opens Monday. Whether he keeps the job remains to be seen. The
Cowboys will miss Randall Godfrey, who tested the free-agent waters
and went to Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas quietly signed a pair of linebackers from the Tennessee
Titans this spring. Joe Bowden, a nine-year pro from Oklahoma, and
Barron Wortham, a seven-year pro from Texas-El Paso, have talent
and Super Bowl experience.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden is expected to supplant Darren Hambrick at strong-side
linebacker. As for Wortham, he will be pressed to play if the
undersized Nguyen cannot withstand the pounding.
</P>
<P>
   Which newcomer will be the biggest surprise?
</P>
<P>
   Remember this name: Jackie Harris. The former Tennessee Titan
was outstanding in the Super Bowl. He is a good blocker who will
also play in two-tight end sets. That should enable veteran David
LaFleur to become more involved in the passing game.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, LaFleur has been a disappointment since he
became the team's top draft choice in 1997. To be fair, he has not
been used the way former Cowboy Jay Novacek was during his heyday.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys will revert to their old offensive playbook, which
features more work for the tight ends. In Harris, the Cowboys have
a good-hands receiver who is capable of starting if LaFleur
flounders.
</P>
<P>
   Will the Cowboys miss Michael Irvin?
</P>
<P>
   Do the Bulls miss Michael Jordan? Of course. No matter what
people think of him, Irvin was immensely popular among his
teammates. Few, if any, have worked harder in training camp, and
Irvin often motivated others to work harder.
</P>
<P>
   Before Irvin suffered his neck injury last season in
Philadelphia, he still was a productive receiver, capable of
catching more than 80 passes per season. He was Aikman's favorite
target because he ran precise routes. Irvin, bigger and stronger
than most of the players who covered him, rarely was pushed around
at the line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the locker room, no player was more upbeat and respected
than this future Hall of Famer.
</P>
<P>
   Is Joey Galloway as good as advertised?
</P>
<P>
   Yes. Galloway has never played for a quarterback with Aikman's
credentials, and it will not be a surprise if he catches 90 passes.
He already has been tabbed the team's No. 1 receiver, a label Irvin
had for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Galloway had a terrible season last year, stemming from a bitter
contract dispute in Seattle. In the previous four years, he
averaged 65 catches and nine touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Galloway is another reason the Cowboys let go of Sanders.
Galloway has scored four touchdowns on punt returns and has a
career average of 10 yards per return. With Rocket Ismail as the
No. 2 passing target, Dallas should have one of the fastest tandems
of receivers in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Is Randall Cunningham worth the gamble?
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time in Aikman's career that he has had a
backup quarterback with first-team ability. Cunningham, 37, has
been such a good player for most of his career, last year's
collapse in Minnesota was a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas offers Cunningham a fresh start with eager teammates.
Longtime Cowboy Jason Garrett, who has signed with the Giants, was
a popular and steady reserve, but he lacks Cunningham's arm
strength and athletic ability. If Aikman goes down, Dallas has
someone who has tasted success a starter. His mission: to prove
last year's confidence breakdown was a fluke.

NASCAR drivers could benefit from F1, CART, IRL formulas
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By TERRY BLOUNT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Defending Winston Cup champion Dale Jarrett should walk into the
NASCAR offices immediately and insist the points system be changed
to the one used by CART.
</P>
<P>
   If that were the case, Jarrett would be out in front of the
points standings after 18 races instead of ranking third behind
Bobby Labonte and Dale Earnhardt.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Stewart, Rusty Wallace and Jeff Burton also could climb up
a few notches if Winston Cup was using any other points system of a
major racing series _ be it CART, the IRL or Formula One.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the drivers who would benefit from a change,
they are stuck with a NASCAR points system that is drastically
different from the other three.
</P>
<P>
   Other racing series use fewer points per race and place more of
an emphasis on winning and finishing near the front.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR's system is based on consistency and awards points to all
43 drivers who make the field. Formula One gives points for only
the first six finishing spots and CART distributes points for the
first 12 spots.
</P>
<P>
   In F1, there is a 40 percent difference between winning and
finishing second (10 points to six). In CART and the IRL, it's a 20
percent drop unless the second-place driver wins the pole and leads
the most laps. Then it is a 10 percent difference.
</P>
<P>
   But in NASCAR, it is possible for the winner and the
second-place driver to earn the same amount of points in a race.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a winner of a Winston Cup race earns a minimum of
180 points _ 175 for the victory and five bonus points for leading
a lap. The second-place finisher earns 170 points, but that driver
can receive five bonus points for leading a lap and five more for
leading the most laps.
</P>
<P>
   That would mean both drivers would earn 180 points. That
scenario happened in the Pepsi 400 at Daytona Beach two weeks ago
when Burton won and Jarrett was the runner-up.
</P>
<P>
   The most points a Winston Cup winner can receive is 185, which
is only 8 percent more than the driver who finishes second and 10.8
percent more than third place.
</P>
<P>
   The good part of the NASCAR points system is that a driver isn't
penalized as much for a poor finish. However, that also makes it
more difficult for contending drivers to catch up to the leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is consistency,'' Labonte said. ``Somebody could come
up and win five races, but right now, I would take the one win I
have and a lot of second-place finishes over five wins and a lot of
DNFs (did not finish).''
</P>
<P>
   For the last seven years, the leader at the halfway point of the
Winston Cup season has gone on to win the championship.
</P>
<P>
   The driver in front at midseason knows as long as he finishes in
the top 10 every week, it is unlikely anyone will catch him for the
points lead. But finishing eighth in an F1 or CART event while the
guy chasing you wins the race probably is going to be costly.
</P>
<P>
   The points leader in Winston Cup can afford to drive less
aggressively than the leader in other racing series.
</P>
<P>
   ``You start racing for points instead of racing to win,'' said
Burton. ``I don't like that. I don't like racing for points. I
don't think anyone does.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, Labonte's teammate at Joe Gibbs Racing, has run as well
as anyone over the last six weeks. Stewart has three victories in
the last six races, climbing from ninth to fifth in the points
standings.
</P>
<P>
   However, had NASCAR been using any other points system, Stewart
would be nearer the top _ fourth in both the CART and IRL systems
and second in F1, only two points behind Labonte.
</P>
<P>
   The most points a driver can make up in one race is 151, but
Stewart still is 215 points behind Labonte. In the other three
systems, he would be within the points he could earn in one race.
</P>
<P>
   The most consistent top-five finisher this season has been
Jarrett, who has finished in one of the top-five spots 10 times. If
NASCAR was using the CART points system, Jarrett would be seven
points ahead of Labonte.
</P>
<P>
   But three drivers in the top 10 should be glad NASCAR doesn't
adopt one of the other ways of distributing points. Ward Burton, in
fourth place, would move down at least four spots in the other
systems because he has only three finishes in the top five.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt, who is only 45 points behind Labonte, would move down
in the other three point systems, which wouldn't reward him as much
for the eight times he has finished sixth through 10th.

AFTER 29 YEARS, CAMP CAMPO FINALLY ARRIVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dave Campo has waited 29 years for this moment.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Cowboys' first-year head coach, in his first year as
head coach at any level, celebrates his 53rd birthday Tuesday, the
same day the Cowboys begin two-a-day workouts in their third summer
of training camp in Wichita Falls.
</P>
<P>
   All players are due to be in camp and checked into their
dormitory rooms at Midwestern State University by Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Camp Campo is more than just a catchy name for a blend of
something old and something new: old ideals brought back for a new
start under Campo, a member of the Cowboys' coaching staff since
1989 who has worked under Jimmy Johnson, Barry Switzer and Chan
Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   Having seen firsthand what it took for the Cowboys to win three
Super Bowls in the 1990s, Campo is bringing back ``a family
atmosphere,'' along with crisper practices, an emphasis on fewer
penalties and a new-look coaching staff that is committed to
teaching players what needs to be carried out.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, who are coming off an 8-8 season in which they were
eliminated in the first round of the playoffs for the second
consecutive year, have returned to a basic offensive philosophy
that allowed Troy Aikman to flourish in the '90s, and have updated
it to include many of the packages used by the St. Louis Rams to
win a Super Bowl last season.
</P>
<P>
   You can't begin to talk about Camp Campo without talking about
the return of former Cowboys quarterback coach Jack Reilly as
offensive coordinator and of former Cowboys offensive coordinator
Ernie Zampese as offensive consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Or the addition of Wes Chandler (wide receivers) and Andre
Patterson (defensive tackles) to the coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   Or the promotion of Mike Zimmer (defensive coordinator) and Bill
Bates (secondary).
</P>
<P>
   Campo believes that this is the Cowboys' best collection of
``teaching'' assistants since the '89 season, when Jerry Jones
bought the team and brought in Johnson from the University of
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just don't throw the ball out there anymore; you have to
coach,'' Campo said. ``One of the things that we felt gave us an
advantage in 1989 (leading up to the Super Bowl years) was that we
had a bunch of teachers on the staff. This staff that we have now
can really teach, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis on teaching comes along at an appropriate time for
the Cowboys, who, Campo said, ``are becoming a young team again,''
particularly at cornerback, linebacker, defensive end, wide
receiver and fullback, and in the kicking game.
</P>
<P>
   To maximize the learning process for both young and old players,
Campo has cut out much of the fat from the workout schedule. Four
months of voluntary, twice-a-week workouts at Valley Ranch during
the off-season were replaced by two minicamps and two quarterback
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Each practice also has been tightened up, which will carry over
to Camp Campo.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to be a quick-strike, fast-break type of
offense, then we've got to get up on the line of scrimmage and get
going,'' Campo explained.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Cowboys are returning to an offense that uses more
personnel packages, motions and shifts than were used in the Gailey
offense, an up-tempo philosophy is deemed necessary to give Aikman
enough time at the line of scrimmage to read the defense. Campo has
even added a 40-second play clock to practice.
</P>
<P>
   One advantage Campo has over his predecessors, particularly
Gailey, is that he hasn't had to prove himself to veteran players.
Campo knows them. They know Campo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave may be only 5-foot-6, but he's probably the feistiest guy
on the field,'' said strong safety Darren Woodson, a five-time Pro
Bowl selection.
</P>
<P>
   To say that Campo is eager to get started is an understatement.
He spent the first 29 years of his career as an assistant,
including 18 years at the high-school level and stints with 11
colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were a player, I would like to play for Dave Campo,''
owner Jerry Jones said. ``His style is very comfortable and
enthusiastic, yet firm.''
</P>
<P>
   Camp Campo begins Monday, although it actually takes the field
for the first time at 9 a.m. Tuesday, followed by a 4 p.m. workout.
Each session lasts about two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Discipline will be a big part of Camp Campo. The Cowboys
finished last season as the NFL's most penalized team with 125
penalties for 1,109 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advantage I have is that I do know the people here,''
Campo said. ``And I think I already have had a certain amount of
respect within the organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The working relationships between Campo and Jones and between
Campo and Reilly are clearly defined and shouldn't pose a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to call plays,'' Campo said. ``I'm going to
manage the game.''
</P>
<P>
   As for working with Jones, who serves as owner and general
manager, Campo said: ``Jerry wants to win a Super Bowl. And I do,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo and his wife, Kay, have six children. With the Cowboys in
training camp, the Campos have about 80 additions to their family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at a football team like a family,'' Campo said. ``You
teach your players just like you teach your kids at home _ same way
_ through repetition.'' nn

WILL OWNER'S SPENDING SPREE PAY OFF FOR REDSKINS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It apparently wasn't enough for the Washington Redskins to win
the NFC East last season. They have gone out and bought their way
into the role of conference favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Daniel Snyder, who reminds NFL observers of a young Jerry
Jones, seems intent on beating the Cowboys' owner at his own game
by putting his money where his mouth is and buying marquee players
through free agency.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins, despite a $62.172 million NFL salary cap, were
able to land cornerback Deion Sanders, defensive end Bruce Smith,
safety Mark Carrier and quarterback Jeff George by signing them to
long-term, cap-friendly deals with large signing bonuses spread
over the length of their contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The signing bonuses for Sanders, Smith, Carrier and George alone
total $17.25 million, including $8 million for Sanders, who was
waived by the Cowboys because of salary-cap reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins, meanwhile, made room under their salary cap by
releasing veteran running back/return man Brian Mitchell and
restructuring the contracts of defensive tackle Dana Stubblefield
and safety Sam Shade.
</P>
<P>
   Going into this weekend, the Redskins were expected to pay close
to $20 million more in signing bonuses to sign their top two draft
picks _ Penn State linebacker LaVar Arrington and Alabama offensive
tackle Chris Samuels. They were the second and third draft
selections overall.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins have budgeted $5 million as a signing bonus for
defending NFC rushing champion Stephen Davis, but that might not be
enough. Davis' agent, Steve Weinberg, wants a long-term deal with
considerably more than $5 million up front before his client will
report for training camp this week.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has received the team's ``franchise player'' tag after
turning down the Redskins' five-year, $31 million offer in
February. Still, Davis has made it known that he will refuse a
one-year deal, including the $3.5 million tender a running back
with the ``franchise player'' label will be paid under NFL rules
for the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, life has become much more complicated for the
Redskins, who hadn't made the playoffs since 1992 before winning
the NFC East last season with a 10-6 record. They lost to Tampa
Bay, 14-13, on the road in the divisional playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The heat is on Norv Turner, although that is nothing new. The
former Cowboys offensive coordinator was on the hot seat last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Consecutive losses to Buffalo and Philadelphia, followed by a
Dec. 5 loss at Detroit, drew whispers of the Redskins blowing their
division lead over Dallas and the New York Giants. But the Redskins
finished strong, winning three of their last four games.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Turner is expected to get the Redskins into the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   While Turner runs the offense, which will have the accurate Brad
Johnson at quarterback with veteran George in reserve, the
Redskins' defense has been turned over to Ray Rhodes, who was fired
after one season as head coach in Green Bay. Washington ranked 30th
on defense in the NFL last season.
</P>
<P>
   But Sanders, Smith and Carrier are expected to improve that area
with their collective talent, experience and leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders will team with second-year man Champ Bailey to give the
Redskins one of the NFL's best cornerback tandems, while
40-year-old Darrell Green enters his 18th NFL season as probably
the best non-starting cornerback in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, Smith and Green will share the cover of the Redskins'
2000 media guide, although Green has had to be digitally inserted
into the layout because he missed the photo shoot in order to be
with his ailing father in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, Green received his own pile of money from Snyder.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-time Pro Bowl selection was signed this off-season to
a five-year, $10 million contract that included a $2 million
signing bonus, or roughly twice as much as Green was to make under
the terms of his existing contract.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's time to find out if all that money pays off for Snyder
and the Redskins. nn

IT'S TIME TO GIVE TRAINING CAMPS THE BOOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ah, yes. Wichita Falls, Texas, beckons on the northern horizon.
A city once famous for red draws and the swimming pool party in
``The Last Picture Show'' now also hosts the biggest waste of time
in professional sports _ an NFL training camp.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Cowboys are coming back Monday. Wichita Falls is
proud. Everybody else is, well, resigned, which has nothing to do
with the cultural aspects of Wichita Falls. It's ``any'' training
camp anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a league that has been so progressive in all other areas,
training camp is the one thing that was never updated, never
changed,'' Daryl Johnston said Friday, while also noting that it's
times like these that make him a happy recent retiree from the
Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept of training camp goes back to at least the '50s,
when players had to work a second job in the off-season to make
ends meet,'' Johnston added. ``They came to training camp to get
into football-playing physical condition. They needed six weeks and
a bunch of games. But today's players are ready to play, basically
right now. Yet the league is still in the 50s.''
</P>
<P>
   Blame it on, what else, money. Training camp is, of course, set
up around the exhibition season _ a minimum of four preseason
games, and for the Cowboys, usually five. This summer is no
exception with a trip to Japan mixed in.
</P>
<P>
   The home exhibitions have become revenue sources the owners are
not willing to give up. Therefore, as the Cowboys report Monday,
they are still seven weeks from opening the regular season. The
veteran players privately gripe like crazy at this concept
(Johnston is much more outspoken now that's he's retired), but from
summer to summer, nothing changes. Players have long advocated
adding two regular-season games to give the owners their revenue,
while also trimming the six weeks of training camp back to three.
But it's always the same ol' same ol'.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball has six weeks of spring training, including some 30
exhibitions, but at least there's validity in this schedule, based
on a pitching staff needing the time. But due to the off-season
workout programs, plus the minicamps and quarterback schools, it's
like Johnston said _ football players are almost physically ready
the first day they step into a training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two weeks of contact drills would be about right, then play an
exhibition game,'' he noted. ``After that, go easy for a week, play
a second game, then open the season. Everything else is a waste of
time.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, of course, there's the heat factor. Wichita Falls is
boiling, but so was Austin. Following the lead of Jimmy Johnson in
1990, this will be the 11th consecutive summer the Cowboys have
trained in the oven that is a Texas summer. The pleasant days of
Thousand Oaks, Calif., long-time training camp home for the
Cowboys, are a distant memory.
</P>
<P>
   The switch to Austin coincided with the Cowboys rise to dynasty
status in the '90s. Johnson preached constantly that the two were
connected. Johnston might have been one of Jimmy's favorite
players, but he couldn't disagree more.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the truth about Austin and Wichita Falls, and the heat
that's involved,'' Daryl said. ``As a player, you are at your best
in physical conditioning the day you report to training camp. As a
player, you are at your worst in physical conditioning the day
training camp is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The heat beats you down, and beats you up. You spend the first
four weeks of the regular season trying to get back to the fitness
level you had on the first day of training camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston recalled the summer of '92 when he broke a bone in his
hand the first week of training camp. ``I missed the next three
weeks of practice in Austin, and went on to have the best season I
ever had. I never felt better or stronger. Even when we were
winning Super Bowls, some of our worst games, and some of our
losses, came early in the season at Texas Stadium when it was hot.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons, I always thought, is we were still dragging
from the heat in Austin. My disagreement with Jimmy would be we had
the best players _ that's why we won in those days.''
</P>
<P>
   This will also be the training camp when a new head coach takes
over, and Dave Campo is a believer, somewhat, in the Jimmy Johnson
philosophy of pushing hard on the practice field. ``Within
reason,'' Johnston said, ``that might be a good idea. Dave won't
overdo it, I'm sure, but we were always a physical offensive team,
and under Chan (Gailey) in Wichita Falls that really changed. It
wasn't, however, just the heat or the fear of injury. Chan's
offense was different from what we'd had. Not as physical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going back now to the old offense, it makes sense that there
needs to be more hitting, but again, it has to be within reason.
Dave knows that.''
</P>
<P>
   From force of habit, Johnston said he's been watching the
temperature in Wichita Falls for several weeks. ``The triple-digits
are back,'' he said, and then added, laughing, ``I plan on visiting
camp, so I need to know what to wear.''
</P>
<P>
   Daryl also noted he won't be hard to miss on the sidelines in
Wichita Falls: ``I'll be the guy carrying a six-pack on my
shoulder, and smiling a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Give it a couple of weeks in Wichita Falls and many of his old
pals will be wishing they had joined Johnston in retirement. nn

BASEBALL ENJOYING THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everybody's enjoying the backyard barbecue. The sun is shining.
The kids are in the swimming pool, splashing around and having a
wonderful time. The burgers are almost done. It's a perfect day.
</P>
<P>
   But there are storm clouds on the horizon, threatening to blow
in and ruin the festivities.
</P>
<P>
   So it is with major-league baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Like the folks at the barbecue, everyone's having a wonderful
time.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance is about what it was before the 1994 strike because
of the combination of megastars such as Mark McGwire, Ken Griffey
Jr., Barry Bonds, Randy Johnson and Pedro Martinez, palatial new
ballparks and compelling pennant races.
</P>
<P>
   The many corporatesponsors at the All-Star Game indicate the
game finally is learning how to market itself at the national
level.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the industry is healthy and thriving.
</P>
<P>
   But the dark, ominous storm clouds are gathering.
</P>
<P>
   This storm has a name. It's called economic disparity.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of medium-market (or medium payroll, anyway) teams such
as the Oakland Athletics and Chicago White Sox is a good story.
It's also an aberration.
</P>
<P>
   The chasm between the team with the largest payroll and the club
with the smallest is greater than it has ever been. Not only does
the gap between the haves and have-nots ruin competitive balance,
it also threatens to ruin the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that revenue sharing, salary restraint,
the way we do business with each other, all of that has to be
changed,'' commissioner Bud Selig said last week. ``The fact of the
matter is that the disparity thing is so serious; wherever I go,
whether it's Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Minneapolis, San Diego,
Milwaukee, Seattle, people are concerned. They're concerned that
their team doesn't have a realistic chance of winning.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest example of the problem happened just the other day
when the Reds traded their best pitcher, Denny Neagle, to the
Yankees for a handful of prospects.
</P>
<P>
   The minor-leaguers included some of the best in the Yankees'
system, but all things being equal, a team would prefer the
production over the potential. Things, though, aren't equal.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle can be a free agent at the end of the season. The Reds, a
medium-market, Midwest franchise, offered him a three-year, $18
million contract that he turned down. So they traded him to the
Yankees, who almost surely will give him the deal he wants.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the juggernaut rolls on. After the Neagle trade, along
with the David Justice deal a couple of weeks before, the Yankees _
the first team with a payroll to top $100 million _ have to be
favored to win the World Series for the third consecutive season
and for the fourth time in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds, meanwhile, are left with a hole in the rotation and
the hope that the prospects will pan out.
</P>
<P>
   And the Reds are a viable franchise with a new stadium on the
horizon. What chance do clubs like the Minnesota Twins and Montreal
Expos have?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, of course, is none.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that baseball is well aware of the problem, and
is trying to do something about it.
</P>
<P>
   The ``blue-ribbon'' economic study committee recommended some
good, common-sense proposals in its report at the owners meetings
in New York on Friday. The committee suggested the sport adopt a
vast increase in revenue sharing, and consider allowing weak
franchises to move. It did not say the sport needs a salary cap,
words that could signal the start of a potentially devastating
labor war.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that there's still a long battle ahead before
the recommendations are adopted.
</P>
<P>
   The committee proposed a 50 percent luxury tax on payrolls above
$84 million, a measure that would cost the Yankees about $15
million. Owner George Steinbrenner won't be happy about that, and
neither will the union, which vehemently is opposed to any measure
that would serve as a drag on salaries.
</P>
<P>
   What the union always fails to recognize, though, is that while
sharing the wealth might prevent the Yankees from spending so much,
it would give clubs such as the Twins the financial wherewithal to
boost payroll. The overall amount spent on player salaries would
remain about the same.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, something has to be done. The committee's
recommendations might not be the final answer, but they're at least
a good starting point.
BASEBALL'S NO. 1 SECRET
</P>
<P>
   A couple of writers at the All-Star Game were lamenting the fact
that it's hard to do a story on Expos outfielder Vladimir Guerrero
because of his limited grasp of English. A guy who's fluent in
Guerrero's native tongue joined in the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not that good in Spanish, either,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero, a native of the Dominican Republic, doesn't have
anything against the media. He also doesn't have much to say to his
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go in the clubhouse you would see he doesn't talk
much,'' Expos second baseman Jose Vidro said. ``He doesn't even
talk to his teammates. He's always listening to his music.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Guerrero is a snob who thinks he's better than
everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a shy guy,'' Vidro said.
</P>
<P>
   The language barrier, the shyness, the fact he plays in
Montreal, combine to make Guerrero the Unknown Superstar.
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe not unknown. But he's certainly not as recognized as
he should be. A lack of attention and notoriety can be the only
reason he wasn't elected to start in the All-Star Game by a
landslide.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero batted .324 with 38 home runs and 109 RBI in 1998, his
first full season in the majors. Last year he hit .316 with 42 home
runs and 131 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   He's on pace to better all those numbers this year. After going
2-for-4 with a home run in the first game after the All-Star break,
Guerrero was hitting .371 with 24 homers and 78 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Those are MVP numbers, superstar numbers, numbers that could get
better because he's still young and he's still improving.
</P>
<P>
   ``He still has a lot to learn,'' said Vidro, himself an
underrated star. ``There are some things that are going to get
better and better. He's only 24, and he's done a lot in his
career.''
</P>
<P>
   So what if the average fan doesn't realize how good he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the pitchers know about him,'' Vidro said. TRADE GRADE
MUST WAIT
</P>
<P>
   Reds GM Jim Bowden called the deal of Denny Neagle to the
Yankees for four prospects a ``high-risk, high-reward trade.''
</P>
<P>
   The potential reward, of course, is if third baseman Drew
Henson, outfielder Jackson Melian, left-hander Ed Yarnall and
right-hander Brian Reith develop into front-line major-leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   The risk _ in addition to trading their best pitcher _ is that
Henson might give up baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Henson has a ton of talent, both on the diamond and the football
field. He's the quarterback for the Michigan Wolverines. He's
currently playing in the minors, but his priority for the next
couple of years is football. Then, he'll pick one sport.
</P>
<P>
   If it's not baseball, the reward will be significantly less. A
TRADE THAT WORKED
</P>
<P>
   Brian Giles could count on cashing a postseason check every
season when he played for the Cleveland Indians. He played in three
Division Series, two Championship Series and one World Series in
his three seasons in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Since being traded to Pittsburgh, he can count on beginning the
off-season in early October. A good season for the Pirates is a
.500 record, not a postseason appearance.
</P>
<P>
   However, the trade was the best thing to happen to Giles because
it gave him a chance to display his talents.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Cleveland I was getting a label as a fourth outfielder or
platoon player,'' he said. ``That can be a tough label to shake
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, in his first chance as a regular, Giles hit .315
with 39 home runs and 115 RBI. This year he's an All-Star.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I could put up some numbers at the big-league level if
I was given the opportunity to play every day, but it's tough when
you're not playing every day to get into a routine,'' he said.
``You feel like you have to swing the bat well every time you play
to get a start the next night. You put too much pressure on
yourself, and you can't be the player you think you're capable of
doing.'' CAL STILL A PLAYER
</P>
<P>
   Rumors that future Hall of Famer Cal Ripken, on the disabled
list with recurrent pain in his lower back and leg, apparently the
result of a disk fragment left behind from September surgery, would
announce his retirement on Thursday proved false.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken denied that he is close to retiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to put the uniform back on and see what happens,'' he
said. ``I want to play as much of the second half as I possibly
can.'' CROW GLADLY EATEN
</P>
<P>
   Toronto Blue Jays starter David Wells, never shy about speaking
his mind, ripped the organization for trading Shawn Green for Raul
Mondesi in the off-season. He ripped it again in spring training
for failing to trade for a veteran pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Blue Jays tied for first in the AL East with the
Yankees, Wells acknowledged he made a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I ate my words,'' he said. ``I looked very foolish,
but everyone makes mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Mistakes like the one the Yankees made when they traded Wells to
the Blue Jays before the '99 season. Since then, Clemens is 20-16
with a 4.51 earned-run average. Wells is 32-12 with a 4.32 ERA for
the Jays. Wells has pitched 360 innings to Clemens' 282 1/3. IN
SUPPORT OF JUAN
</P>
<P>
   Even though Juan Gonzalez hasn't contributed as much as hoped
for, and even though he might be traded because he refuses to
consider signing a long-term contract, Detroit Tigers reliever Todd
Jones said no one in the clubhouse is bitter toward their teammate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no animosity toward him,'' Jones said. ``We just want
him to be happy. He's a good guy. He's been great with us. He's
been a perfect teammate. He's very conscientious. He's very
sensitive, and he's very concerned about the guys on the team. He
tries to keep all of the other stuff out of the clubhouse.'' AROUND
THE NL
</P>
<P>
   Florida Marlins All-Star pitcher Ryan Dempster suggested that
the team's unexpected success this season goes beyond the young
talent maturing. Attitude also is a reason they are above .500. ``I
think we're hungry,'' Dempster said. ``When you get beat up year
after year, that's a tough thing to go through. When the experience
starts to catch up with the talent, you really get hungry for wins
and to prove to people that we're for real. Guys really have their
roles down. It's just going to continue to grow and improve on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Mets' starting pitching has been at least as good
as Atlanta's, but New York needs help in the bullpen and is fearful
of the possibility of the Braves getting Rangers closer John
Wetteland. ``If they do that, we're in trouble,'' a club official
told the ``Bergen Record''.
</P>
<P>
   Houston Astros manager Larry Dierker could soon pay for the
team's sorry performance with his job. Dierker appeared to safe a
few weeks ago because he's owed $1.5 million over the next two
years and owner Drayton McLane isn't inclined to pay people not to
work, but with dissatisfaction with the manager growing in the
clubhouse the club is expected to reassign him within the
organization in hopes he'll quit.
</P>
<P>
   Reds manager Jack McKeon could find himself in the unemployment
line before Dierker. The Reds gave up on the season when they
traded Neagle, so it makes sense to bring in the manager who'll be
working with the team next year. It won't be McKeon, who is in the
last year of his contract. Bob Boone could be the new manager by
this time next week.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Kile was 21-30 with a 5.84 ERA in his two seasons in
Colorado. He was 11-5 with a 4.51 ERA and an All-Star in the first
half for the Cardinals. However, he refuses to blame the thin air
in Denver for his problems. ``It really doesn't matter where you
pitch,'' he said. ``You just have to make quality pitches. In
Colorado, I just didn't make many quality pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Reds reliever Danny Graves had one of his worst games of the
season after finding out he'd made the All-Star team last Sunday.
He hit a batter with the bases loaded, then threw the ball away
after fielding a grounder. ``The happy emotions just took over in
my body, and I had no idea what was going on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies' team record for drawing intentional walks is 14,
set by Larry Walker in his MVP season of 1997. First baseman Todd
Helton has already been intentionally walked 13 times. AROUND THE
AL
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim Angels outfielder Darin Erstad had 144 hits in the first
half, 123 away from George Sisler's single-season record of 257,
set in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City Royals first baseman Mike Sweeney thought he had a
good chance to make the All-Star team, but with the number of
quality players at his position in the league, and with the fact
that the club already had one representative in elected starter
Jermaine Dye, he wasn't sure. He wasn't worried, however. ``I kind
of thought of it as a win-win situation,'' he said. ``I was hoping
to be here because I thought I'd performed well and had a chance of
being selected, but at the same time I made alternate plans. If I
didn't make the team I was going to go fishing up in the Ozarks.
Either I had 2 1/2 days to relax and go fishing and spend time with
God, or I was going to come to Atlanta and have a dream come
true.''
</P>
<P>
   Tigers pitcher Hideo Nomo, heretofore not noted for having much
of a sense of humor, recently won the human sausage race at County
Stadium in Milwaukee. Nomo, wearing the Italian sausage costume,
beat three other competitors in the race from the left-field corner
to home plate. ``He had to get his running in,'' manager Phil
Garner said.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Jays catcher Darrin Fletcher celebrated his 1,000th career
game last Sunday at Montreal with his second career stolen base.
His only other stolen base came on July 18, 1997, also at Olympic
Stadium while playing for the Expos. ``That's kind of like Halley's
comet,'' he said. ``I'm surprised they even counted it as a stolen
base and not indifference, but I'll take it. One for every 500
games isn't bad; this is my American League stolen base.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle Mariners pitcher Aaron Sele said to gauge the strength
of the AL West, all anyone has to do is look at the last-place
team. ``That's a team that's loaded with great offense,'' he said
of the Rangers, his former squad. ``Luis Alicea is having a
spectacular year, and that's your leadoff guy. The first six guys
are strong, and then they've got guys contributing at the bottom.
And that's your last-place team.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he was happy to make the All-Star team, White Sox
second baseman Ray Durham couldn't understand why Frank Thomas
didn't join him. ``I felt that he should have been here,'' Durham
said. ``The players on our team, the players on other teams felt he
should have been here. He was a little upset, and I was a little
upset. You could see he was a little upset, and I think he had
every right to be upset. He's having one of the best seasons of his
career.''
</P>
<P>
   The Twins haven't traded second baseman Todd Walker yet because
GM Terry Ryan wants value in return. The problem is, the Twins have
made it clear Walker has no value to them. The best bet is they'll
trade Walker to the first team that offers something better than a
bucket of used balls, perhaps the San Diego Padres. THE WEEK AHEAD
</P>
<P>
   The early part of the week features the so-what portion of the
interleague schedule, with series such as Orioles-Marlins, Red
Sox-Expos, Twins-Cardinals and Royals-Cubs. The best of the lot
appears to be the Mariners at the Diamondbacks, which at least is a
battle of divisional leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The important series come next weekend, with the Mets visiting
Atlanta and the Rangers visiting Seattle's Safeco Field for the
first time. THE LAST WORD
</P>
<P>
   ``There are definitely two tiers of players at these things. The
ones who know they'll be an All-Star again. And the ones who can
only hope.'' Tigers reliever Todd Jones, a first-time All-Star nn

KELLIE KUEHNE COULD BE NEXT QUEEN OF AMERICAN GOLF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The LPGA Tour's best player, Karrie Webb, hails from Down Under.
</P>
<P>
   Its second-best player, Annika Sorenstam, arrived from Sweden,
and a glance at the tour's top 20 money leaders this season shows
that half come from foreign soil.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the United States' best player, Juli Inkster, says
``we need some youngsters, good American youngsters to step up.''
</P>
<P>
   The LPGA suffers from a lack of young, home-grown stars and, in
particular, one who can elevate the tour's popularity as Nancy
Lopez did during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no better candidate exists than Dallas' Kelli Kuehne, a
5-foot-2 bundle of energy with the never-ending smile. Kuehne, 23,
possesses the charisma, talent and girl-next-door looks to become
the heiress to Lopez. Her battle against diabetes only increases
her allure.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is Nancy Lopez-like,'' said Tammie Green, a seven-time
winner on the LPGA Tour. ``She wants to be a superstar and
understands everything that goes along with being one.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuehne, who has one tour victory, will compete this week in the
U.S. Women's Open at Merit Club in Libertyville, Ill. She emerged
as the rage of the 1999 Open at Old Waverly Golf Club in West
Point, Miss., after firing a first-round 64 en route to a
third-place finish to Inkster.
</P>
<P>
   ``People kind of put my name in that void because we haven't had
a great American player in several years,'' said Kuehne, who ranks
43rd on the LPGA money list with $131,252 this year. ``It's no
secret that we've had some good golf players, but none of them have
has been the dominant force like Tiger \RWoods\S is on \Rthe
men's\S tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in some regards that it's absolutely very important to
me because That's what I want to do, but I think it's going to be
very difficult with the talent and as many great players as we
have.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, replacing Lopez could be even more challenging.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it: There will never be another Nancy Lopez,'' said
Inkster, 39, who has six major tour victories to her credit.
``She's the ultimate, but as Kelli gets older _ along with the
other young players _ I think they will mature and understand that
we really need them to take this tour to the next level. I think
they can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who sponsor Kuehne agree with Inkster's assessment. She
might not be a superstar but Kuehne is getting superstar
endorsement money, reportedly more than $6 million over four years
from a group of sponsors that includes Nike, Top-Flite and Hain
Foods. She recently changed management companies to Gaylord Sports,
dropping International Management Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Kelli has the opportunity to make a statement for
American women's golf and be a person that a lot of people can look
up to,'' said Kuehne's father, Ernie. ``People have been referring
to Nancy Lopez as the queen of ladies' golf and Kelli as the
up-and-coming princess. That's a title she can live up to, and
American golf desperately needs someone like Kelli to step up and
take the spotlight.''

JUROR SAYS A `SENSE OF MISSION' LED TO HUGE TOBACCO DAMAGES 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ It was the lies, the jury's foreman said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a period of 50 years, these tobacco companies denied the
dangers of their product,'' said Leighton A. Finegan, the foreman
of a six-member jury here that punished the tobacco industry with a
$144.8 billion punitive damage judgment, the largest damage award
in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``They belittled or denied causation of the health effects of
smoking and addiction, and had the gall to challenge public health
authorities,'' and even used fabricated science to dispute the
risk, Finegan said in an interview on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Finegan, 44, who went into the trial believing that a person
smoked cigarettes as a choice, found among his fellow jurors a
reasoned and unanimous conviction to punish the tobacco industry.
The point, he said, was not whether people had the choice to smoke
or not to smoke, but that the companies knew they were selling a
defective product and denied that it was defective.
</P>
<P>
   Settlements with the states that had challenged the industry had
not sent that strong message, but the award of punitive damages to
about 500,000 sick Florida smokers _ though certain to be appealed
_ would, the jury hoped.
</P>
<P>
   It had to come in a way, Finegan said, that would break through
the wall of denial and invulnerability that had surrounded the
industry for a half-century.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a sense of mission,'' said Finegan. ``And we did not
want to ignore the tremendous devastation that the product has
caused. The number had to match that. It had to be significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it was fair. It would bring to the forefront, for
the first time in the history of this country, the issues
surrounding this product and the millions of lives that have been
affected by this. And it would put the companies on notice _ not
just the tobacco companies, all companies _ concerning fraud or
misrepresentation of the American public.''
</P>
<P>
   But even more grating than the lies, as the panel began
deliberations after two long years and 157 witnesses in the
class-action suit, was the arrogance, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To minimize the deaths of so many people,'' exclaimed Finegan,
an assistant elementary school principal. ``We have seen the deaths
of 400,000 people a year for 50 years. And they stand up in court
and say that if we give a huge verdict it's a death warrant for the
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   To all six jurors, it seemed as if the five largest tobacco
makers in the country ``thumbed their noses at the system,'' even
suggesting that one smoker's throat cancer was caused by wood dust,
said Finegan.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel they are above reproach,'' he said. ``They committed
fraud. They lied to the American public. They devastated millions
of lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was insulting,'' the foreman said. ``It's just the tobacco
industry's mentality, that they are beyond challenge. No one has
ever challenged them and won.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury, as most juries are, was a cross section of real
people, who had their lives rearranged by the sheer length and
importance of this trial. The jury included, besides Finegan, a
welder, a telephone technician, a postal worker, a bank teller, and
another school employee.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors were asked to consider sums of money they could not
have imagined. When the punitive phase of the case ended and the
judge, Robert Kaye of Miami-Dade Circuit Court, sent them to the
jury room to consider the punishment, they did not just pull a
number out of the air or settle on the more than $150 billion that
the smokers' chief lawyer, Stanley M. Rosenblatt, demanded.
</P>
<P>
   They had heard witnesses for both sides testify about what the
companies could pay. Lawyers for the companies had said the
cigarette makers could afford to pay $150 million to $375 million,
but would be put out of business if the jury granted anything
approaching the requested award. The jury chose not to believe
that.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In the jury room, in the less than five hours of deliberations,
the jurors each named a figure, ranging from $100 billion to $200
billion. The members of the jury averaged those figures and came to
$145 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Then, they looked at the market share of each of the five
companies and two institutes that had given false information about
smoking, and using that and other financial information, broke down
the total: Philip Morris, the country's largest cigarette maker,
$73.96 billion; R.J. Reynolds, $36.28 billion; Brown &AMP; Williamson,
$17.59 billion; Lorrilard Tobacco, $16.25 billion; Liggett Group,
$790 million; the Council for Tobacco Research, $1.195 million; and
the Tobacco Institute, $278,389.
</P>
<P>
   After the verdict was announced on Friday afternoon, ``I felt a
great sense of relief that what we did was right and justified
according to the evidence presented,'' Finegan said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, he and the other the jurors _ Gary Chwast,
Jacqueline Brinson, John Mestre, James Strowbridge, and Delvia
Ferreyra _ are probably among the best educated people in the
country on the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   Finegan still has the notice he received on July 8, 1998,
informing him to report for jury duty.
</P>
<P>
   An assistant principal at an elementary school in the Kendall
area, south of Miami, he was a former teacher of social studies and
American history, who had lectured students _ from his heart, not
just the book _ on civic responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would just be a short thing,'' he said. ``I would
serve for a month or two and that would be it. I would complete my
civic duty, and I would have something to take back to the school
and tell the kids about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have a greater insight into the legal process, and I
could bring a wealth of information back. Never for one moment did
I think this would be two years.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial took over his life and the lives of the other jurors,
he said. It was not just the time it took them away from their
families. They saw their futures rearranged by it.
</P>
<P>
   They gave up promotions because of it, he said. Finegan, who has
a wife, Marice, and a 3-year-old son, had helped start a magnet
school in Miami-Dade, but had to give up his job there because the
trial consumed so much of his time.
</P>
<P>
   It all began when the lawyers asked him, during jury selection,
to state his feelings about smoking. Finegan, who immigrated to the
United States from Jamaica in 1988, said he had no strong feelings
about smoking, and had always felt that if person smoked, it was
through their own free will.
</P>
<P>
   Then came months of information, scientific data and testimony
from people who had had throats and lungs surgically removed, and
evidence that showed the addictive nature of the product and how it
was made to be addictive.
</P>
<P>
   One woman testified by videotape. She had died as the trial
dragged on, and a tape was shown after her death.
</P>
<P>
   The industry first said it was not as bad as it was being made
to appear, but the jury ruled, in July 1999, that the tobacco
industry manufactured a deadly product, and that it had deceived
the public for years. In April, the jury ordered the companies to
pay $12.7 million in compensatory damages to the smokers. In the
punitive stage of the trial, the stage just concluded, sick smokers
first asked for $196 billion in damages. But their lead lawyer,
Rosenblatt, would eventually suggest an award of $154 billion to
the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as the trial went on and Finegan was gone so much
from work, someone moved into his office at the school. He said he
began to feel out of place, marginal. He was a part-time worker in
a full-time job.
</P>
<P>
   There was a big window in the jury room, he said. Sometimes he
and the others would just sit in front of it and watch people walk
by _ people going about their lives without such grave
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw people going about their daily routines,'' he said.
``Sometimes we felt like we weren't going anywhere. We were
stationary.''
</P>
<P>
   They saw their families at night, but much of a person's worth,
he said, is in how they do their job, and they were not at their
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have your goals and aspirations being achieved,'' he
said. The other members of the jury spoke about it, too, he said.
``Someone else is carrying on your job,'' he said. ``It devalued my
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Finegan could not talk about his life's focus, that trial, with
anyone but the other five jurors. ``There was a movie that came out
called `The Insider,' about the tobacco industry. We were told not
to watch it.''
</P>
<P>
   The jurors sat beside each other so long they became friends,
baking birthday cakes and exchanging Christmas presents. ``We got
pretty close,'' he said. ``We got to know each other's
temperaments, personalities. We celebrated each other's birthdays,
knew each other's jobs.'' They shared pictures of their children.
</P>
<P>
   Even though they had an awesome responsibility before them, he
said, ``we felt somewhat inconsequential.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, literally, came judgment day.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, or perhaps not oddly at all, the six members of the jury
did not scatter after the verdict was read. They went to a cafe in
Coconut Grove, together. They promised to keep in touch.

NAVRATILOVA'S JOURNEY ENDS AT HALL OF FAME 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ The spooky bushes that used to swallow Martina
Navratilova's wayward lobs had been cleared away, and the wall that
absorbed the backhands she belted with her grandmother's heavy wood
racket was gone.
</P>
<P>
   But almost everything else was the same. So when the 43-year-old
Navratilova stepped on the courts tucked away in the countryside of
the Czech Republic just this past month, it was as if she tripped
the door on a time capsule containing the first shreds of evidence
to her improbable journey.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the vulnerable lefty who had the courage to flee a
communist country, the fearlessness to face scrutiny by coming out
and a drive that changed the physical image of the female athlete
was standing on a manicured lawn at the Tennis Museum and Hall of
Fame on Saturday as an inductee from the class of 2000. Before she
served and volleyed her way to 18 Grand Slam singles titles, before
she supplied the contrast that turned her rivalry with Chris Evert
into folklore, there was a bare beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to have to fix the courts in the spring,'' Navratilova
said. ``That was our membership dues. We'd spend about 20 hours
pulling the weeds and putting the clay on, etc.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother and father met through me. When my father would take
the clay to the court in the wheelbarrow, I would get in the
wheelbarrow and he'd wheel me down. I was about 3 years old then.
He liked me because I was smiling and so happy _ of course I was
happy because he gave me a ride _ but that's how my parents met. So
tennis not only brought my parents together, but then my parents
being together brought me to tennis. It's a big circle.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, that circle included her fellow inductees. There was
Judge Robert Kelleher, who grew tired of the payments being made
under the table to players and fought for the approval of Open
tennis in 1968. There was also Malcolm Anderson, who came off a
cattle ranch in Australia to become a force on his country's Davis
Cup team and was the first unseeded player to win the United States
National singles title, in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   Through longevity and circumstance, all three are linked. In
1974, Navratilova played mixed doubles with Anderson. In 1981 she
became a U.S. citizen in the same Los Angeles federal court over
which Kelleher presided. With Billie Jean King's former husband,
Larry, as her lawyer, Navratilova went through naturalization with
50 others from all backgrounds. The six-year wait after her
defection was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no decision,'' Navratilova said before the induction
ceremony. ``If I wanted to play tennis, I had to leave the country.
The difficult part was doing it. I was 19, young and didn't think
about the consequences to do it. I had to make the choice. And what
I regret the most is that I had to make that choice and that I can
never have those years back with my sister, with my parents, with
my grandmother. If I wanted to play tennis, I had to do it. Once I
got out, I knew I couldn't go back.''
</P>
<P>
   She just pushed forward with some help along the way. The same
year she became a citizen, she also had an epiphany induced by
Nancy Lieberman-Cline. If she wanted to find an edge, she'd have to
do what no other woman had done at the time: live in the gym.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember going to French Open the first year,'' said
Lieberman-Cline, who attended the ceremony Saturday. ``And I was
thinking when we got back to the hotel, and then I asked Martina,
`When are you going to practice?' And she said, `Well, I just did.'
I went, `You got to be kidding me. You call that practice? You hit
the ball for 15 minutes, you talk to Billie Jean, you wave to
someone else, you hit an overhead and then we went back to the
hotel. No wonder you don't win all the time. Your practice habits
stink.'''
</P>
<P>
   With prodding from Lieberman-Cline, Navratilova began to carve
out a fit physique never seen on a female tennis player before. A
month or so later, Dr. Renee Richards began sculpting Navratilova's
game as her coach. As Navratilova developed her game, the riveting
rivalry between herself and Evert evolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was wonderful to be one half of the greatest rivalry in
sports,'' Navratilova said. ``You may have team rivalries, but as
for players, I can think of Ali and Frazier, but how many times did
they fight? Three? We had 80 battles in singles. We made each other
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Navratilova's impact on the game still resonates _ fitness is
not an option for players anymore _ but what has separated her from
so many other athletes today is her attention to activism. Although
her honesty about her homosexuality has cost her millions of
dollars in endorsements, her conviction is unwavering as she
continues to speak out on homosexual issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important,'' Navratilova said. ``And I think every piece
of legislation is important. Until there is equal protection and
equal rights, I'll keep speaking out. I don't want it to be an
issue, but it is because we don't have the equal rights. It's
something I couldn't even talk about until I became a citizen. It
was a disqualifier to getting my citizenship. It shouldn't be that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   She is serious when she speaks. But she also prompted more
laughs than anything else Saturday. When she addressed the crowd,
she said, ``It's nice to be able to talk about yourself without
feeling guilty or without having to pay somebody to listen to
you.''
</P>
<P>
   When she thanked everyone who had helped her in her career, she
also added a thanks to all the ``doctors who held me together,
homeopathic people, osteopaths, massage therapists, and I'd like to
thank my dogs for keeping me company throughout my career, even all
the girlfriends who suffered through all the matches in the stands
_ wherever they are.''
</P>
<P>
   She was surrounded on Saturday by those who have always stood by
her, her doubles partner, Pam Shriver; Lieberman-Cline; Richards;
and her mother, Jana.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so happy,'' Jana said. ``To be here, it's such a long way
from where she started.''

LAUSD SEEKS TO CREATE NEW OFFICE OF ETHICS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID R. BAKER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Despite an annual price tag of $250,000 or more,
the Los Angeles Unified School District wants to create an ethics
office to teach its employees right from wrong after years of
embarrassing administrative scandals.
</P>
<P>
   District officials want an ethics officer who will train the
school system's 70,000 employees how to avoid compromising
positions and conflicts of interest. The ethics officer also would
sift through complaints of ethical violations and determine which
ones should be investigated by the district's chief inspector.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the investigations we do here are ethical problems,
and ethical problems can lead to criminal problems,'' said
Inspector General Don Mullinax, who originally pitched the idea to
school board members.
</P>
<P>
   The idea comes in spite of efforts to trim the immense
district's central staff and split Los Angeles Unified into 11
miniature districts with some autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   As advertised, the ethics position would pay between $77,200 and
$95,600 each year. Ads call for ``an individual of admirable
character, integrity, and significant experience.'' Applications
are due by Friday, July 21.
</P>
<P>
   The officer may also have a support staff of five people whose
total salaries could top $250,000. The office could include
analysts, who typically earn between $40,000 and $50,000 a year, as
well as clerical staff, with salaries around $30,000, district
personnel director Jon Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   School district officials said they don't mind adding another
officer and support staff, so long as the officer produces results
and the staff isn't too large.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need is someone who is vigilant about conflicts of
interest, about revolving doors - those kinds of issues,'' board
member David Tokofsky said. ``As long as next week someone doesn't
come back to us and say we need ethics officers for all 11
districts and one downtown, I'm not worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics question why the district needs such an officer at all,
arguing the money would be better spent in the schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have yet to be convinced that the ethics issues are so
complicated that they can't be handled by a written policy,'' said
Jon Coupal, president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the position seemed more a response to past
ethical lapses at the district than the current situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like closing the barn door after the horses are
already gone,'' Coupal said.
</P>
<P>
   While they are rarely found at suburban or rural districts,
ethics officers are common features of America's largest school
systems, according to the Council of Great City Schools, an
organization representing big, urban districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way of ensuring the integrity of the system for the
sake of the public,'' said Michael Casserly, the council's
executive director.
</P>
<P>
   Board member Caprice Young said major corporations such as her
former employer, IBM, regularly hire ethics officers. She said the
position could help efforts to restructure the district and its
departments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing I want to do is build a multibillion-dollar
project, and have it shot because the people don't understand
ethics,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   Mullinax said he was amazed to find no ethics officer when he
arrived at the district last year. Such huge and complex
organizations as Los Angeles Unified - where the annual budget now
tops $8 billion - usually need and have such officers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there any lack of work for such an officer, Mullinax
said. Questions of nepotism and cronyism have long dogged Los
Angeles Unified. The district's fraud-reporting hotline logs about
100 tips each month, Mullinax said.
</P>
<P>
   His office has uncovered instances of contractors offering
employees gift certificates to popular stores in return for their
business. Many workers seem oblivious to the conflict accepting
such an offer could cause, Mullinax said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll say, 'You mean we shouldn't take that gift
certificate?''' he said. ``If the employees have never been told
something's not ethical, they don't know what's unethical.''
</P>
<P>
   His office is now working on a new, more detailed ethics policy
for the district, which recently ditched a proposed ethics policy
drafted by a consultant because it was too vague.
</P>
<P>
   And he wants the ethics officer to create and run a training
program to show employees the guidelines they must follow for
spending the public's money. Mullinax has already conducted about
40 training sessions at schools and offices but says he can't do
enough to make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day, every second, you're tempted to make an ethical
decision, right or wrong,'' Mullinax said. ``Do I let this person
buy me lunch? Do I take home the company car?''

   LOS ANGELES _ San Fernando Valley police divisions are
abandoning entire mid-shift patrols because they don't have enough
officers and their local commanders can't approve overtime for the
shifts, the Los Angeles Daily News has learned.
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with a shortage of firefighters and paramedics in the
Los Angeles Fire Department, the police shortage brings questions
of who's available to answer emergency calls, or how quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``My ongoing frustration with both the Fire Department and the
Police Department is that you can never get straight and accurate
answers about how many officers are deployed and where they are
deployed,'' said City Councilwoman Laura Chick, whose district
includes the West Valley. ``The numbers shift like sand. What is
the deployment going to be like when the (Democratic National)
Convention is up and running in a few weeks?''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Police Department's staffing shortage comes as
some areas of the Valley are reporting increases in crime. Police
say they are taking longer to get to emergencies because their
ranks are stretched so thin.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage of personnel forced police on Thursday to cancel a
pair of four-officer shifts intended to patrol the West Valley
Division when the LAPD's afternoon and night shifts are changed.
</P>
<P>
   Other Valley divisions have been affected by the officer
shortages. The Foothill Division did away with its four-person,
mid-day shift in March. The Devonshire and North Hollywood
divisions have had to cancel cars on occasion, but haven't had to
to cancel shifts. Officers from the Van Nuys Division have been
forced to respond to calls across the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened (Thursday) night is symptom of the lack of
personnel,'' said the West Valley's top officer, Capt. Donald
Floyd. ``But it doesn't mean that there weren't any cops on the
street. We would be more effective if we had a full complement of
personnel. It does have an impact on crime. This is something we
live with all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, 10 cars are assigned to the West Valley Division's
three main eight-hour shifts, which begin at 11 p.m., 7 a.m., and 3
p.m. Four officers each are assigned to two afternoon and night
shifts. The officers are assigned to patrol the streets to give
relief to the officers on the main shifts. These two shifts were
canceled Thursday because five officers were in training, and three
others had the day off.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd said that his overtime budget will not allow him to pay
for officers to cover the short shifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll pay OT for officers to go to court, or if a cop is
bringing in an arrestee late,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   LAPD spokesman Lt. Horace Frank said it is not uncommon for a
division anywhere in the city to cancel the number of cars on
shifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not uncommon to be short on any shift,'' he said Friday.
``The day watch shift routinely is short because that's a shift
where officers get subpoenaed to court. Sometimes officers call in
sick. Others are in training.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank's explanation was no consolation to Woodland Hills
Homeowners Organization President Gordon Murley.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were to put together all their excuses, we'd have the
largest book ever put together in the whole world,'' he said. ``The
LAPD allows too much switching around of times. If you don't have a
commitment to do the job at the time they were hired to do it, then
they shouldn't be doing police work.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Frank rebutted: ``These are not excuses, they're facts of
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Staffing shortages are nothing new to the LAPD. In 1998, the
Police Department borrowed 42 Valley cops to fill its ranks in
other city divisions. As a result, the Valley had recorded some of
the slowest response times in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The shortages continue. The LAPD is in the middle of a
nationwide recruiting drive that hasn't made a dent in the 700
spots it needs to fill.
</P>
<P>
   Officers on the street Friday said that the staffing shortages
are chipping away at morale.
</P>
<P>
   A patrol officer from the West Valley Division said that during
the past couple of months, as few as eight cars have been sent out
to patrol during a shift.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are supposed to have a minimum of 10, so the public is
losing out on public service,'' said the officer, who asked not to
be identified. ``Our response time is going down and morale is
going down.''
</P>
<P>
   The officer said on many occasions, officers don't even have
enough time to eat during their work day.
</P>
<P>
   ``If calls are too heavy ... we don't get our request granted to
eat,'' he said, shaking his head.

GENERAL MANAGERS MAKE THEIR PITCHES FOR PITCHERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Dodgers are looking for a No.2 or No.3
starting pitcher. So is Arizona. And Colorado. However, San
Francisco likely will stay intact.
</P>
<P>
   If no one in the National League West makes a move, Arizona
remains the odds-on favorite to win the division, but a trade
changes the complexion of it. The phones of all general managers
are busy as they try to acquire the pitcher needed to push them to
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's Ismael Valdes, Baltimore's Scott Erickson and
Houston's Jose Lima don't particularly excite many general managers
for a trading-deadline deal. If Philadelphia decides to move Curt
Schilling, or Baltimore says Mike Mussina can be had, or Montreal
makes Dustin Hermanson available, then the scenario could become
interesting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say these next (two weeks) will determine whether
we'll participate or go the other way,'' Colorado general manager
Dan O'Dowd said.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks were among the many teams scouting Andy Ashby
before he was traded by Philadelphia to Atlanta, and they've also
charted Pittsburgh's Francisco Cordova and has talked to Seattle
about John Halama and Brett Tomko.
</P>
<P>
   But like everyone else, Arizona general manager Joe Garagiola
Jr. doesn't think it's a smart move to rent a pitcher for two
months for a couple of prospects who can come back and bite you for
years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be a lot of names thrown around the next
few weeks,'' Garagiola Jr. said. ``Off of the conversations that I
have already had, right now there are some very, very unrealistic
price tags attached to some of those names. If we get to July 31
not having done anything, I don't think this is a time to make some
panic move.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said he's talking to other
teams, but none of the available starting pitchers are reason to
get excited.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Giants don't plan to make a move because the
market isn't worthy of such a move.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to trade for the sake of trading, because we
have enough talent here,'' Giants general manager Brian Sabean
said. ``I'd be reluctant to make a trade that wouldn't help us
short term and long term. I don't know if I'd want to get involved
with somebody else's free agent and give up the ranch.''
</P>
<P>
   Neagle's niche: Before the Reds traded left-hander Denny Neagle
to the Yankees for four minor-leaguers, they offered him a
three-year, $18 million deal. Not only didn't he like the deal,
there was never a counteroffer made.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, deals like this are very difficult, because you're
trading your No. 1 starter,'' Cincinnati general manager Jim Bowden
said. ``Obviously you're hurting your chance of winning now. ... I
know this deal is going to be unpopular for the present. ... We're
concerned about how fans are going to react, the media are going to
react and how players are going to react.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden said the Reds couldn't afford to sign Neagle to a bigger
deal because they're in a small market, though that didn't stop
Minnesota from signing Brad Radke to a huge deal.
</P>
<P>
   More altitude fodder: Every year it's the same thing. Colorado
pounds the ball in the altitude at Coors Field and the Rockies
stumble on the road. Entering Saturday, they were 28-11 at home and
17-31 on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the team batting average is .358 at home and .238 on
the road. In 48 games on the road, they have 22 homers while
opponents have 55. ``Our lack of power really shows up on the
road,'' O'Dowd said.
</P>
<P>
   Green with remorse: When Toronto traded Shawn Green for Raul
Mondesi, Blue Jays pitcher David Wells popped off about what a huge
mistake the deal was for Toronto. But having lived with Mondesi for
half the season and seeing him in right field, Wells changed his
mind about how Toronto fared in the swap of right fielders with the
Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I ate my words,'' Wells said. ``I thought we had a
good team last year. To make a deal like we did, I didn't
understand it. But once these guys came to camp, I realized how
good they were. I looked foolish. I made a mistake. Now, when I see
Raul Mondesi out in right field every day, it's a blessing in
disguise.''
</P>
<P>
   Green entered Saturday hitting .290 with 13 homers, 60 RBI, 15
stolen bases and four errors. Mondesi was hitting .282 with 23
homers, 64 RBI, 21 stolen bases and six errors.

BROWN LIKELY TO MAKE HIS NEXT START
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Upon further examination, Kevin Brown's strained
right shoulder muscle should not keep him from making his next
start and pitching coach Claude Osteen has been absolved of any
wrong doing regarding the history of the injury.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who left his Friday start against the Angels with
stiffness in his right shoulder, was examined by Dodgers team
physician Dr. Frank Jobe. The strain is of the muscles in the back
of the shoulder near the rotator cuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he probably won't miss a start,'' Jobe said. ``He
doesn't have any pain, but he does have stiffness. The reason it's
significant for him is he usually doesn't have any stiffness after
a start like most pitchers. He's already a lot better than he was
(Friday).''
</P>
<P>
   Jobe said no MRI was needed because there is no clicking or
catching in the shoulder. Jobe added that the stiffness Brown
experienced in San Diego during his July 6 start may not be related
to this injury.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's scheduled to pitch Wednesday against Colorado, and it's
likely he'll make that start. Brown will be evaluated on a daily
basis, and he will ice his shoulder after throwing until he feels
fine, Jobe said. Brown typically doesn't ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It think it's definitely related (to San Diego) because I
didn't feel anything until then, so it seems too coincidental for
it not to be related, in my mind,'' Brown said. ``I'm satisfied. It
just spasmed up. It should be able to get worked out in the next
couple of days, and we should know something better when I throw on
the side (Monday).''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, manager Davey Johnson cleared up what became a
misunderstanding after Brown left Friday's game with the shoulder
soreness. Brown told team medical personnel about his shoulder
feeling strange after the start in San Diego, but because he didn't
get treatment it wasn't included in the daily medical report given
to Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Brown didn't tell Osteen about it until after he left the game
against Anaheim and was being examined by trainers. Johnson
initially thought Osteen learned of Brown's discomfort after the
San Diego start.
</P>
<P>
   However, it took Brown longer than usual to get loose to pitch
in Tuesday's All-Star Game, and Johnson said he probably would have
given word to Atlanta manager Bobby Cox about the situation had he
known.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was upset about it (Friday) night thinking Claude knew ahead
of time, but he just found out,'' Johnson said. ``I always want to
know, then I can ask the player what it is. If it's something
that's a little different, you can do something. ... (Osteen) is in
the clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Green feeling blue: For the first two months of the season,
right fielder Shawn Green was lauded for his contributions. His
presence was instrumental in a potent offense. However, things
aren't going so well now.
</P>
<P>
   Green went 0 for 3 Saturday and was 1 for 11 in the three-game
series with Anaheim. Couple that with Green's 6-for-50 slump
heading into the All-Star break, and he's 7 for 61 (.115) and his
average is .287.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll work my way out of it, but it's not fun,'' Green said.
``It's not fun struggling. This is worse than the past couple of
years. Any time anyone is struggling, it's confidence. Anybody that
says differently is lying.''
</P>
<P>
   Catching quandary: Todd Hundley is hopeful he'll return to the
lineup Monday against Pittsburgh. Chad Kreuter returns today after
serving his eight-game suspension for his part in the May 16 fight
at Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   And by the time right-hander Mike Judd is recalled from Triple-A
Albuquerque for Tuesday's start against the Pirates, Hundley should
be fine, Kreuter's problems will be a thing of the past and Paul
LoDuca is likely headed back to the minors despite playing well.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Johnson said second baseman Mark Grudzielanek is
doing better and is expected to come to Dodger Stadium today after
missing the last six games with viral infection. Grudzielanek is
hoping to play either Monday or Tuesday.... Lefty Carlos Perez
begins serving his five-game suspension today.

TODAY'S SEX TALK WITH TEENS, ABOUT AIDS AND DEATH, SEEMS TO BE
WORKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DONALD BRADLEY  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Teen-agers say ``the talk'' is finally changing their attitudes
about sex.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not the talk of morals and the sanctity of marriage
that parents pushed for eons. That was the talk that didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   The latest edition is not about love and virtue. This talk is
about AIDS and death.
</P>
<P>
   And it seems to be working.
</P>
<P>
   The national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
announced last week that new surveys show rates of sexual
intercourse among American high school students have declined for
the first time in two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1991 and 1999, the percentage of students ages 14 to 18
who had engaged in intercourse dropped from 54.1 to 49.9, the study
showed. And among teens who are sexually active, condom use is
rising.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the survey means that nearly half of American high school
students have engaged in sexual intercourse. And some teens are
questioning the accuracy of the survey, saying they think the rate
of sexual intercourse among their peers is much higher.
</P>
<P>
   But the report of declining sexual intercourse was heralded as
great news by many teens, youth experts, health officials and
parents. They say it proves the value of early sex education in
schools and parental ``talks'' at home.
</P>
<P>
   And it raises this question:
</P>
<P>
   How could this generation fight off the roaming hands of a pop
culture and mass media seemingly obsessed with sex? Movies,
magazines, music, TV _ everywhere teens look, somebody is in bed
and, apparently, having a great time.
</P>
<P>
   The survey didn't ask why, but Kansas City area teens were quick
with their answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is totally aware from the time they are 9 years old
that you can get AIDS and die,'' said Carrie Moreland, 17, who will
soon begin her senior year at Notre Dame de Sion High School. ``To
most kids, that means something.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about morality ... it's not that we're saving
ourselves for marriage. That has nothing to do with it. It's about
staying alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say this generation is the most informed yet about
sex-related health risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools are really trying to scare us, and it must be
working,'' said Justin Morasch, 17, who will be a senior at
Archbishop O'Hara High School.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Ponton, professor of adolescent psychiatry at the
University of California at San Francisco, said the decline shows
that it takes years of sex education to alter teen behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids have been hearing about AIDS since elementary
school,'' said Ponton, whose new book is The Sex Lives of
Teenagers: Revealing the Secret World of Adolescent Boys and Girls.
``They know it's out there and they know they can get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as Janice Ellis, the new president of Kansas City's
Partnership for Children and founder of Reach for the Stars, a
nationally recognized teen pregnancy prevention program, said:
``AIDS is a pretty good deterrent. Death puts a chill into sex.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Campaign for the Prevention of Teen Pregnancy
expands on the trend. Its surveys show that most teens _ eight out
of 10 girls and six out of 10 boys _ who have been sexually active
wish they had waited until they were older.
</P>
<P>
   Teen pregnancy rates also have been dropping, although the rates
in the United States far exceed those of other developed countries.
</P>
<P>
   Pulitzer Prize winner Laura Sessions Stepp said teens still
could be putting themselves at risk by engaging in sexual acts that
stop short of intercourse. She said teens are seduced by the mass
media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girls in late elementary grades look at magazines and they
start wearing slinky slip dresses and 3-inch heels,'' said Stepp,
who wrote Our Last Best Shot: Guiding Our Children Through Early
Adolescence. ``Movies, TV _ these images bombard kids at a very
early age.''
</P>
<P>
   If teens are resisting media influence because of AIDS, it has
taken a while. The epidemic is now in its third decade.
</P>
<P>
   But other reasons for a decrease in the number of sexually
active teens may reach even further into America's social
evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Many parents of today's teen-agers grew up witnessing the sexual
revolution, which had its heyday in the late 1960s through the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Sexual mores changed. A growing tolerance of divorce, birth
control, abortion and premarital sex swept the country.
</P>
<P>
   Taboos were lifted. Sex was no longer dirty. Pregnant teens were
no longer secretly taken away in the night to go visit their aunt
in Florida. Movie and television dialogue made sexual references
commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that because of those things, parents today
are much more comfortable in talking to their kids about sex than
generations before them,'' said Ponton, who has written several
books on teen behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, most teens interviewed for this article said their
parents had talked to them about the risks of sexual activity. Love
and waiting for that right someone is typically part of the spiel,
but today's talk is usually more about the harsh realities of AIDS,
sexually transmitted diseases and youthful dreams shattered by
unwanted pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Morasch said his parents sat him down and gave him the talk
right before his freshman year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of them _ they double-teamed me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, parents said they did not get the same talk from
their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was taboo back then,'' said Chris Yasso, president of the
Lee's Summit Area Council of PTAs.
</P>
<P>
   Not all parents talk with their children now, she said, but
today there is sex education in schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids now learn about sex in the classroom instead of the
hallway or the locker room, where a lot of us learned it,'' Yasso
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Moreland, Carrie Moreland's mother, remembered a day that
illustrates the value of enlightenment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in high school, a good friend of mine feared she was
pregnant because she had French-kissed a boy,'' Moreland said. ``My
daughter and her friends are so much better informed about sex and
STDs (sexually transmitted diseases) than we ever were.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Lett of Kansas City said his teens received the talk early
on, and he sees the irony of the decline: It comes at a time when
teens are most casual about discussing sex.
</P>
<P>
   He often comes home to a group of teens visiting his house.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say things I would never say around my parents,'' Lett
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Moreland thinks feminism also gets some credit. Girls are
no longer meek and deferential to boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's girls view their body as their own, and that is
something set in motion a long time ago ... before they were
born,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ponton agrees that feminism has greatly changed what used to be
a predator-prey role in teen-age sexual behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a power balance now in the way boys and girls relate
to each other,'' Ponton said. ``Girls are much more willing now to
control situations and relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Courtney Lett, 17, who will be a senior at Grandview High
School, is five months into a relationship with her boyfriend.
Friends are always surprised to learn that she and her boyfriend
are not having sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?'' they ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' she answers.
</P>
<P>
   But she does know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see kids who get drunk and have sex,'' she said. ``They
don't think anything bad can happen to them. I'm just not that
confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that I don't want to have sex. It's just I'm a little
scared.''

ETHERTON STOPS SHEFFIELD AT KEY MOMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON VERRELL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In a game of many twists and turns Saturday, the
biggest may have been one of the few times in the weekend
interleague Freeway Series that Dodgers' slugger Gary Sheffield
didn't turn on one of the Angels pitchers' serves.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield slugged four home runs in the three games at Dodger
Stadium, including his 31st of the season in the third inning
Saturday against Angels rookie right-hander Seth Etherton.
</P>
<P>
   But, in the fifth inning, with the Angels ahead by a run, and
the tying run on third base with only one out, Etherton retired
Sheffield on one pitch --- a popup to second. Etherton eventually
got out of the inning and came away with his fourth win in a row,
6-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how good he is,'' Etherton said of Sheffield, who's
slugged six homers in 15 at-bats against the Angels this season.
``He's quite a hitter. I was fortunate to get him to pop it up. I
made a pitcher's pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Etherton, who's 4-1 in seven starts, said he got Sheffield on a
curveball, down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he saw it good,'' Etherton said, ``and he just missed
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Young and not so wild
</P>
<P>
   Angels manager Mike Scioscia'' says the work of Etherton is all
a part of the club's emphasis on good, young pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these guys . . . Etherton, (Brian) Cooper, (Jarrod)
Washburn, (Scott) Schoeneweis . . . it's their makeup, their poise
that's so impressive,'' Scioscia said of his kiddie korp mound
staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys simply go out and make their pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   And, on Etherton, the former pitching star at USC, Scioscia
said: ``He has ice water in his veins.''
</P>
<P>
   No stopping Sheffield
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia explained that he and his staff ``had a couple of plans
in mind'' for pitching to Sheffield.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it didn't work out so well,'' he said. ``But,
fortunately, we were able to hold the rest of the lineup in
check.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. Even with Sheffield's 4 for 9 in the series, the Dodgers
didn't do much at the plate in the three games, a mere .189 (18 for
95). But, minus Sheffield's output, the Dodgers hit only .163 (14
for 86). And, of the Dodgers' eight RBI, Sheffield had five.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next time when we see him,'' Scioscia said, ``we'll try the
one-bounce cricket pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Roll out the skipper
</P>
<P>
   During the series Scioscia made only three appearances on the
field at Dodger Stadium, where he played for 13 years and caught
more games (1,395) than anyone in Dodgers history, Brooklyn and Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Two of them were after the Angels' two wins, Friday night and
Saturday, and the other was in the bottom of the seventh inning
Saturday, when he came out to argue with second base umpire Greg
Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   With one out and the Dodgers' F.P. Santangelo on first, Alex
Cora hit a grounder to the right of shortstop Benji Gil, who was
able to get the force at second. But Santangelo upended second
baseman Adam Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a roll,'' Scioscia said. ``I wanted to get the
(umpire's) interpretation. If it's a clean slide, no problem. F.P.
is a tough player, a clean player. But even if it's an
unintentional roll it's still a roll. You're not supposed to roll
into the bag.''
</P>
<P>
   So, was Scioscia satisfied with Gibson's explanation?
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a roll,'' Scioscia reiterated.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently not.
</P>
<P>
   More Erstad
</P>
<P>
   Angels left fielder Darin Erstad, with more two hits Saturday,
has 149 hits for the season, one more than he had all last season.
</P>
<P>
   After going hitless in four at-bats in the first game of the
series with the Dodgers, Erstad was 5 for 11 in the next two.

DRIVE TO BRING COW ART TO KC LEAVES CRITICS UNMOVED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALICE THORSON  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It might be a whole herd, it might be a single stray, but it's a
safe bet that some life-size fiberglass cows are coming to a
street, park or shopping district near you.
</P>
<P>
   Influenced by last summer's hugely popular ``Cows on Parade''
installation of 322 decorated cows in Chicago, a local group has
just about corralled the project for Kansas City, which would have
300 cows. Although enthusiasm is running high in some quarters, for
others the idea of duplicating the Chicago effort represents the
civic equivalent of cattle rustling.
</P>
<P>
   Discussion is heating up and could be boiling Monday, when local
organizers bring the project before the 12-member Municipal Art
Commission. Commission member Richard Nadeau recently labeled the
effort ``herd instinct, without critical thinking and judgment.''
Supporters argue that the project would be a popular hit and that
proceeds from it would support worthy causes.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's event attracted global media attention and, according
to Nathan Mason, curator of special projects for the Chicago
Department of Cultural Affairs, raised $200 million for the city,
primarily in tourist dollars. At the end of the outdoor display,
which was paid for with corporate sponsorship, the decorated cows
were auctioned, raising $3.5 million for charity.
</P>
<P>
   An installation of 500 decorated cows now is on display in New
York City. Other cities are looking at ``creature shows'' ranging
from 1,000 fiberglass bulls in Los Altos, Calif., to fiberglass
moose in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the Chicago project caught the attention of Karen
Holland, an advisory member of the Municipal Art Commission.
Holland, who also is chairwoman of the Missouri Arts Council,
spearheaded the volunteer effort to get a similar herd of bovines
for Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Several months ago, she and a group of supporters approached the
Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art about being a beneficiary of the
project, and the museum agreed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Kemper, the Kansas City version of ``Cows on
Parade'' would benefit the American Royal and the Kansas City Zoo.
On June 20, the three organizations signed a contract with the West
Hartford, Conn.-based CowParade Holdings Corp. to ``bring the cows
home,'' in the words of Dan Keegan, director of the Kemper Museum.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, representatives of the Kemper, the zoo and the
American Royal will ask the Municipal Art Commission for permission
to install the cows on city property from May to August 2001. The
cows would be placed throughout the metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   The upcoming presentation spurred Nadeau, an opponent of the
project, to fire off a letter to Mayor Kay Barnes and to circulate
it to the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a franchise project _ commercial art, not public
art,'' Nadeau argued in his July 6 letter.
</P>
<P>
   Among the issues Nadeau raised was the copycat overtones of
reproducing the Chicago venture.
</P>
<P>
   Keegan said the core group agonized over the question of doing
cows in initial meetings about Kansas City's community project.
</P>
<P>
   They considered different animals _ New Orleans did fish,
Cincinnati did pigs _ and other objects, and even explored the idea
of doing beef cows instead of the dairy cows used in Chicago. But
the costs were prohibitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking at figures like a half-million dollars to get
a designer and make a prototype,'' Keegan said. (Under the
contract, CowParade Holdings Corp. will provide Kansas City with
fabricated cow forms.)
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Keegan said, the group ``couldn't come up with an
object that said `Kansas City' better than a cow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the original cow town,'' he said. ``It is the fact that
has established this community. It's nothing to apologize for; it's
something to celebrate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City ``Cows on Parade'' largely would follow the
blueprint used in Chicago, enlisting nearly 300 artists to decorate
fabricated fiberglass cow forms. Local corporations would be
invited to sponsor cows and have their names listed on accompanying
plaques for $5,000 each, for a potential corporate outlay of $1.5
million. Of each $5,000, $1,000 would go to pay the artists and
most of the rest would go to cover expenses.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the outdoor display, the cows would be auctioned,
with the proceeds benefiting educational programs at the Kemper,
the American Royal and the zoo.
</P>
<P>
   No taxpayer dollars would be spent on the project, Keegan said.
Out of the $5,000 per cow paid by corporate and individual
sponsors, CowParade will cover shipping, placement, maintenance,
upkeep, marketing and publicity, and liability, as well as the
artists' fees.
</P>
<P>
   According to Keegan, CowParade would put out an open call for
artists to submit designs, which would be reviewed by a committee
of local arts professionals and community representatives. The
committee also would invite ``significant national and regional
artists'' to submit designs, Keegan said.
</P>
<P>
   Project guidelines prohibit pornography, corporate logos or
signs in the designs of the cows. CowParade retains the copyrights
to the designs as part of the overall exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of using decorated fiberglass cows to enliven city
streets began in Switzerland, with a 1998 parade of 800 cows in
Zurich. This summer, there are CowParade displays in New York City;
West Orange, N.J.; and Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers are not proving as enthusiastic about the project as
Chicagoans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's really art,'' said Tom Eccles, director of
the Public Art Fund, a nonprofit organization that organizes public
art projects in New York. ``It has the potential to be an
incredible setback if you're trying to present serious but engaging
contemporary art in public spaces,'' Eccles said in a recent
telephone interview. ``It certainly hasn't caught on with the
artistic community of New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   A story in the July 12 New York Times asked: ``Isn't it time to
put those fiberglass visitors out to pasture?''
</P>
<P>
   ``So now New York is copying Chicago, a cow town, and
Switzerland, a cow country,'' writer Sarah Boxer observed in an
article that did not once use the word ``art'' in its review of the
project.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer noted that several designs, including a ``Moonica Lewinsky
cow,'' were rejected by the New York organizers.
</P>
<P>
   Although Boxer characterized the cows as ``a public moosance,''
Keegan thinks Kansas Citians will be enthusiastic about the bovine
invasion here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're confident that this is going to go,'' he said in a
recent interview. ``It's a great project. The community is truly
behind it.''
</P>
<P>
   Keegan recently contacted Janet Simpson, executive director of
the Kansas City Artists Coalition, about having the coalition
represented on the CowParade selection panel.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Star, Simpson was supportive of the
project. ``From the coalition's point of view, we're very happy any
time a project is committed to paying artists for their work,'' she
said. ``We're also very happy that the selection process will be
open and all artists will be invited to submit a proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   Dolphin gallery owner John O'Brien, a prime mover in the
development of the Crossroads Art District and a staunch advocate
of local artists, said he thinks it is disrespectful to artists to
ask them to paint cows.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, O'Brien mused about the $1.5 million
corporate sponsorship of the cows and what it could mean for the
local art scene if used to promote Kansas City art and assist
Kansas City artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Word is getting out that Kansas City is viable,'' he observed.
``There are artists doing unique things, creative things. Why step
back and do something that's been done? That's old hat. We're not
old hat.''

GREENE MAKES UP FOR LOST TIME, REALIZES OLYMPIC DREAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE POSNANSKI  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Maurice Greene's dream was too powerful.
Everything went wrong for him Saturday at the U.S Track and Field
Trials. He stumbled out of the gate. He fell way behind. A stiff
wind blew in his face. The other sprinters tried to play mind
games. Psych him out.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Greene has dreamed all his life of the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Greene is going to the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made the Olympic team,'' Greene sang as he danced. ``I made
the Olympic team.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene made the U.S. Olympic Team on Saturday when he won the
100-meter dash. It wasn't the race he dreamed about. Greene has
studied his race so thoroughly that he has planned every one of the
451/2 steps he takes. He had planned to come here, win, break his
own world record, run the perfect race.
</P>
<P>
   The stumble ended his dream of the perfect race. But this race
showed what kind of heart beats inside Maurice Greene. When he
stumbled out of the blocks, everyone in the stadium gasped. This
the Olympic Trials, a place where dreams are shattered in an
instant. St. Louis' Jeff Hartwig had been an Olympic favorite in
the pole vault, but this week he had trouble with his contact
lenses and was not able to clear the lowest height. His dream died.
</P>
<P>
   And it looked that way for Greene as he fell behind. The
100-meter dash, runners say, is too short to make up a mistake. But
Maurice Greene started gaining. There's no runner in the world who
makes up ground quite like Maurice Greene.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't panic,'' he said. ``I just stayed with it. I just
kept thinking, over and over, `Keep running.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He could not let the dream die. The dream of being the world's
fastest man has been pounding inside him ever since he was a child
in Kansas City, Kan. His parents used to watch him outside the
window, just running back and forth across the yard. When they
asked him what he was doing, he said simply, ``Practicing.''
</P>
<P>
   His older brother, Ernest, was always faster. Maurice at first
dreamed only of catching his brother. When he caught Ernest, that's
when he started thinking about the world. In 1995, he beat the
great sprinter Carl Lewis for the first time. He thought he would
make the Olympic team in 1996. He wasn't quite ready. He ended
those trials in tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't going to let that happen again,'' Greene said
Saturday. ``There was no way. When I stumbled out of the gate, I
just knew I would catch up. I knew I was going to make the Olympic
team. There was no doubt about it.''
</P>
<P>
   He did catch up. He ran by. And then, with the breathtaking
finish _ nobody in the world can finish like Maurice Greene _ he
won. He did not know how to react. In the past, Greene has finished
races with style. He has stuck out his tongue. He has pumped his
fists. He has mugged for the camera.
</P>
<P>
   This time, he simply raised his hand in the air. With one
finger.
</P>
<P>
   That's how he always expected to finish in his dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not shocked, of course,'' Greene said. ``I expected this.
But I still have to let it sink in. I'm going to the Olympic Games.
Those are pretty powerful words. I'm going to the Olympic Games.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene finished at 10.01 seconds, which is relatively slow by
his standards. Greene has run under 10 seconds a record 27 times.
He ran a 9.93 on Friday. But then, this wasn't about time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here to make the Olympic team, that's all,'' Greene
said. ``There was no other goal. I made it. This is my first
step.''

Saints' Williams set to make up for awkward rookie year
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN McCLAIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
THIBODAUX, La. _ When his rookie season came to a merciful close,
Saints running back Ricky Williams could not wait to escape New
Orleans and seek sanctuary in Austin, where he went to college and
is accepted for what he is _ a big kid with a large trophy and a
huge bank account.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is loved and respected in Austin, where he's just as
comfortable in a dormitory room as a million-dollar mansion. He can
blend in with the University of Texas crowd and doesn't have the
enormous responsibility of trying to carry the weight of an entire
region on his broad shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very positive atmosphere for me,'' Williams said
Saturday after the Saints' first practice of training camp at
Nicholls State. ``They didn't try to label me. I didn't have to
worry about people calling me a bum or a crybaby. That happened
almost everywhere I went except Austin.''
</P>
<P>
   In New Orleans, Williams often was viewed as a nonconformist who
was as popular as rap music, as unpredictable as the weather and as
ornery as an agitated alligator. After former coach Mike Ditka
traded everything but Bourbon Street to get him, Williams was under
incredible pressure to produce in almost superhuman fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media put him on a pedestal,'' said first-year coach Jim
Haslett, who was hired to replace Ditka. ``It's tough on a
22-year-old rookie when he's expected to be the savior.''
</P>
<P>
   The expectations of the fans and media were unrealistic and
unfair. After winning the Heisman Trophy and setting the NCAA
Division I career rushing record during his senior year, Williams
was supposed to be a football Moses who would help the Saints march
to the promised land.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere along the way, Williams got lost. Moses became
football's Master P. Rather than sign with a legitimate sports
agent _ and they all wanted to sign him _ he chose No Limit Sports,
founded by Percy Miller, an NBA wannabe and music impresario who
became famous as Master P.
</P>
<P>
   After the Saints traded eight draft choices, including two No. 1
picks, to acquire him, Williams signed what is perhaps the worst
contract in NFL history for a player of his stature. He also posed
in a wedding dress for the cover of ESPN the Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, which was plagued by injuries, he rushed for only
884 yards and scored two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sport driven by results, and I didn't have results,''
Williams said. ``At the (Indianapolis scouting) combine before I
was drafted, (former Oilers running back) Alonzo Highsmith told me
not to play hurt because I'd be judged by how I played when I was
injured, not that I was playing with an injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm not that kind of player. My No. 1 priority is to the
team, not myself. I think you have to make some sacrifices. I
sacrificed people questioning my talent to try to help the team
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams was ridiculed and criticized as an uncooperative,
injury-prone malcontent who went out of his way to irritate the
media by limiting interviews to once a week, conducting interview
sessions with his helmet on, sleeping in his locker and on the
floor, and giving one- and two-word answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't sleep in the locker room,'' Williams said. ``A lot of
that stuff was fabricated. I have to understand that I'm in the
spotlight, and people are going to exaggerate things about me. I
have to make sure to take extra steps to be normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're winning, it's easy to stay positive, but when
things start going bad, you have to look for someone to blame.
Everything just becomes negative.''
</P>
<P>
   When Williams finally sat still for a lengthy interview, he made
the biggest mistake of his career _ he said what he thought about
his coaches, teammates, New Orleans and Saints fans. It was
difficult to find anyone who wasn't insulted by his comments in
Sports Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any of the guys were offended,'' Williams said.
``At this level, we're all men. They'd come to me and ask about it.
I think a lot of guys understood that I was speaking out of
frustration. As a tough competitor, things are going to come out.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I did wrong was that I should have gone to the players
and talked to them about it instead of having them read about it.
But that's in the past, and we're all ready to move on. I think
they respect me as a football player, so I don't think it should be
a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Words won't earn Williams respect from his teammates. Actions
will.
</P>
<P>
   ``My thing about Ricky is that he should be a man about it,''
said quarterback Jeff Blake, who is in his first season as the
starter after leaving Cincinnati as a free agent. ``A man's
responsible for his behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky has an aura about him. When I first met Michael Jordan,
I could feel his aura. Joe Montana was the same way. Players like
that give off a vibe that makes you want to be part of it. Ricky
has that capability, but he has to humble himself and realize it's
not all about him. It's about your team, your family, your loved
ones and your friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you do for people, the more God will bless you. The
more you give, the more you receive.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds offensive tackle Kyle Turley, ``He just has to get out
there and do his job like the rest of us, and if we win, everything
will take care of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Sports Illustrated controversy, Williams fired his
agent and hired Leigh Steinberg, the premier agent in the NFL. One
of Steinberg's specialties is damage control. He has his work cut
out trying to help Williams change his image.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just told me to work hard, but that's never been a problem
for me,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   In the offseason, Williams returned to the University of Texas
to work on his degree in elementary education, which he's two
semesters shy of earning. He sought out Earl Campbell for advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me you've got to learn to accept things that come
along in this game, and the better you do it, the better things
will come out in the long run,'' Williams said. ``Last year, I was
in a different world, and they (New Orleans fans) didn't receive me
the way I'd been received in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``In college, you're looked at as a kid, and I was one of their
kids in everyday life. In the NFL, they expect you to do things a
certain way, and if you don't, they're going to criticize you.
People thought I was cocky and full of myself, but I'm not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might have taken it personally last year because they didn't
know me from Jack. But now I try to not take it personally because
I understand it's part of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams also vacationed in Europe in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was neat because things move slower over there, and people
didn't recognize me,'' he said. ``I had a good time relaxing and
just being myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams was able to be himself at both practices Saturday. His
mother, Sandy Williams, came to camp from her home in Austin. She
wore his No. 34 jersey, signed autographs for fans and talked with
the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know she was here, but that's great,'' Haslett said.
``We emphasized to the players and coaches that we want to build a
family-type atmosphere, and their families are welcome at camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, Ricky doesn't have to be a superstar. It's great
that we have good people who can take the emphasis off him and
allow him to concentrate on football.''
</P>
<P>
   Under new offensive coordinator Mike McCarthy, who was
quarterbacks coach at Green Bay, the Saints are installing the West
Coast offense. If Williams stays healthy, the coaches say he can
rush for 1,200 yards and catch 45 passes. It's the first time
coaches have wanted him to be an integral part of the passing game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any reason I can't be an every-down player,''
Williams said. ``I'm very optimistic about the system and the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``People said I wasn't a good football player last season
because I didn't produce. This season, I don't want attention, but
I understand why I get it. I just want to play football. I'm just
another piece of the puzzle trying to help us win.''

DODGERS SEEING STORM WARNINGS AFTER LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With his expansive knowledge of the movie
industry, Dodgers managing general partner and CEO Bob Daly
certainly should appreciate the latest film about nature's fury,
``The Perfect Storm.''
</P>
<P>
   But with Daly in his infancy running the Dodgers, he may be on
the precipice of experiencing another not-so-pleasant storm. For
the third straight year, that's the direction the Dodgers are
heading.
</P>
<P>
   After falling to the Angels 6-2 Saturday at Dodger Stadium to
conclude their three-game series, the Dodgers are in jeopardy of
falling to .500 for the first time since April 8 if they don't beat
Pittsburgh today.
</P>
<P>
   Even the scorching bat of Gary Sheffield can't overcome the
other problems the Dodgers are experiencing. Sheffield hit his
major-league-leading 31st homer in the third inning, but it was one
of only three hits the Dodgers managed off Angels starter Seth
Etherton (4-1) in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers (45-44) remained six games behind Arizona in the
National League West, though they're in fourth place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a long way to go to catch up, and it's not like we're
chasing one team,'' said Sheffield, who hit four homers in the
three-game series. ``That's the bad part about this whole
situation. If we were playing just as well as those teams in front
of us (it would be different), but we're not. It seems like we're
going the other way and they're going forward. It makes it that
much more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   While Etherton showed composure and control in winning his
fourth straight start, Dodgers right-hander Chan Ho Park (9-7) lost
his third straight. He walked seven for the third time this season
and leads the National League with 78 walks. Each of the three runs
he allowed in his five innings reached base because of walks.
</P>
<P>
   Park, needed greatly if the Dodgers are to make any kind of move
toward the postseason, has followed his five-game winning streak by
failing to win in his past five starts.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels got to the usually reliable Dodgers bullpen to extend
their lead to 5-2 in the sixth inning when Bengie Molina drove in
two runs with a single to right off reliever Antonio Osuna.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone by Sheffield, Angels third baseman Troy Glaus
homered for the third straight game. His solo shot in the eighth
off Matt Herges was his 28th, and gave the Angels a 6-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you're on the road, to win two of three against a
good ballclub, you have to be pleased,'' Angels manager and former
Dodgers catcher Mike Scioscia said. ``It's a good feeling, but
there's no more satisfaction beating this team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels will in San Diego today to conclude their interleague
schedule with a three-game series against the Padres, and they go
feeling good about themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But at Chavez Ravine, questions linger about what the next two
months will be like, not to mention the future of the Dodgers.
Their hope is the return of Mark Grudzielanek and Todd Hundley,
both expected back early in the week, changes their downward
spiral.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you lose, things are not good,'' Dodgers first
baseman Eric Karros said. ``Am I feeling tense? Are certain guys
feeling tense? I don't know about that. I approach the game the
same every day. It's not like all of a sudden I'm going to take it
to a new level. I play as hard as I can every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does everybody want to win and would we like a better
situation? Sure. But it's not because it's a lack of effort or a
lack of desire. ... You'd like to have some stability, but the
bottom line is if you're not winning, you're not winning. I don't
think anybody wants to languish around .500, but change for the
sake of change, I don't know if that's the answer.''

EITZMANN HOPES TO BE QUICK STUDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ Like thousands of rookies before him, Patriots
tight end Chris Eitzmann had a predictable first impression of pro
football: These guys are fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what to expect,'' said Eitzmann after his first
few days with the team. ``I was expecting it to be a lot tougher
than college, of course, but everyone's so quick and fast. They're
a lot faster than they were at Harvard . . . obviously.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Eitzmann was the captain of the 1999 Harvard team, a rare honor
for a tight end, and he has grown _ in many ways _ since arriving
in Cambridge as a 190-pound freshman. Now he is up to 250 pounds,
is football tough _ discard all Ivy League stereotypes _ and comes
to the Patriots as a quick tight end who can catch.
</P>
<P>
   Tight ends in pro football are divided into two categories: the
slower types known for blocking, and the quicker players who can
escape linebackers at the line of scrimmage and free themselves for
passes.
</P>
<P>
   Eitzmann has been practicing with the blocking tight ends, but
his Harvard resume shows speed and receiving ability, with 19
catches last season and 45 for his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did a 4.6 (in the 40-yard dash) a few weeks back,'' said
Eitzmann, ``and I was proud of that. I'd definitely say speed is
one of my strengths. When I came to Harvard, I weighed 190 pounds
and I was never known as one of the biggest or strongest guys, even
in high school. And the tight ends don't catch a lot of passes in
Harvard's offense, so by the time I got to my senior year, I
thought I had developed into a pretty good blocker.''
</P>
<P>
   Eitzmann has already overcome obstacles. He is from the small
town of Hardy, Neb. _ yes, he was Harvard's first captain from
Nebraska _ and was so highly regarded at Chester-Hubbell-Byron High
School (``a regional school for three small farming towns'') that
Nebraska coach Tom Osborne tried to recruit him.
</P>
<P>
   Few Nebraska boys turn down an invitation to play for the
Cornhuskers. But that is exactly what Eitzmann did, and the
Lincoln, Neb., newspaper headlined his shocking decision in words
Eitzmann still remembers: ``Eitzmann turns down Nebraska.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people came up to me and gave me their opinion,''
Eitzmann said. ``They'd say, `How could you turn down Nebraska? You
just turned down every Nebraska boy's dream.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But Eitzmann has no regrets about the decision (``I'm 100
percent sure I made the right choice'') and the folks back home in
Nebraska are with him. ``Now they say, `Chris, you made the right
decision.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The only flicker of doubt in Eitzmann's mind came on draft day
in April, when Eitzmann saw player after player selected from
high-profile football programs. ``I was watching that and I was
thinking, `I wonder if I'd have been drafted if I went to
Nebraska.' But that was it . . . the only time. I know I made the
right decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the draft, the Patriots signed some promising
non-draftees, including a few from the area. Eitzmann met with
agent Brad Blank at Mike Boyle's gym in Winchester, where a few of
Blank's players work out.
</P>
<P>
   Blank, his Boston-based agent, feels Eitzmann has long-term
potential because he went to Harvard, instead of a football factory
where the hours are long and the football days longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's got upside potential that a player from one of
the football factories doesn't have,'' said Blank. ``Compared to
guys who've gone to those kind of schools, where football is a
year-round thing, Chris hasn't played a lot of football. We all
know how Harvard approaches football. If he sticks with the
Patriots in some capacity, the upside for Chris is a lot better
than a guy who's been going nonstop football the last five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with Ben Coates gone, the chances of a rookie free agent
tight end making the Patriots are slim. Eitzmann majored in
psychology and has done summer work at a Boston investment banking
firm.
</P>
<P>
   Might he follow in the footsteps of Nebraska's famed investment
billionaire Warren Buffett if football doesn't work out? Well,
acknowledged Eitzmann, he has not met Buffett, and has not
approached Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. firm in Omaha. Like
many just out of college, Eitzmann said, ``I don't know what I'd do
. . . maybe go back to the farm.''
</P>
<P>
   The 2,500-acre farm has been in the family since 1900 and it'll
soon be time to harvest the soybeans and corn. But Eitzmann is
hoping to be in New England for the fall, sticking with the
Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard . . . we go from 7 in the morning to 6 at night,''
said Eitzmann. The veterans will be taking the field for the first
time Monday, so it gets harder.
</P>
<P>
   But much of the time has been spent on the mental side of pro
football, learning the offense. ``I might have a little edge on the
other guys when it comes to that, but it's still tough,'' said
Eitzmann.

Astros' bullpen melts down against Tigers
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOSEPH DUARTE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
DETROIT _ When it comes to using his bullpen, Astros manager Larry
Dierker calls it a guessing game.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, there were no right answers. Dierker kept sending
pitchers to the mound _ and the Detroit Tigers kept sending runners
across home plate.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' bullpen suffered a total breakdown during a
seven-run seventh inning as the Tigers rallied for an 11-6 victory
before a sellout crowd of 39,189 at Comerica Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole inning was a disaster,'' Dierker said after watching
the Tigers tag four Astros relievers for five hits, two walks and
two sacrifice flies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our relief pitching was terrible. Maybe it would have been
better if I had picked different guys. It's been hard to get anyone
into a role, because it's good game, bad game for almost everybody
down there (in the bullpen).
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm guessing sometimes. Most of the times, I'm
guessing wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The question Saturday was which reliever to employ. The possible
answers:
</P>
<P>
   A.) Yorkis Perez; B.) Marc Valdes; C.) Doug Henry; D.) Jose
Cabrera.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out, it was none of the above.
</P>
<P>
   The first six Tigers reached and scored in the seventh. By the
time the inning was over, the Tigers had sent 10 batters to the
plate and had turned a 5-4 deficit into an 11-5 lead.
</P>
<P>
   After watching the Tigers climb back from a 4-1 deficit to get
within a run, Dierker decided to remove starter Jose Lima after
sixth innings. His plan was for Perez to face Bobby Higginson, a
lefthanded hitter, and then bring Henry in to face the Tigers'
mostly righthanded-hitting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan didn't work,'' Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   Higginson doubled to left-center off Perez, sliding in just
ahead of Moises Alou's throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Higgy made it happen,'' Detroit manager Phil Garner said. ``He
made himself get to second.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry (1-3) faced only three batters, allowing two walks and a
single.
</P>
<P>
   He walked Dean Palmer, and Deivi Cruz followed with a single
that tied the score at 5. After a walk to Juan Encarnacion, Valdes
entered and immediately surrendered a two-run bloop single to
former Astro Brad Ausmus.
</P>
<P>
   Damion Easley's RBI single, two sacrifice flies and a
run-scoring triple by Luis Polonia completed the carnage.
</P>
<P>
   The bullpen has blown 15 of 26 save opportunities this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must be leading the world in blown saves,'' Henry said.
``We've got to find a way to fight out of this. We just can't sit
here and say, `Here we go again.'''
</P>
<P>
   If the Astros weren't thinking that, the Tigers were.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't concerned. I never felt like we were going to lose
the ballgame,'' Higginson said. ``Not with their bullpen and the
way we've been swinging. They really don't have much of a bullpen.
It was like they were out there saying, `When are we going to give
it up?'''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker said he decided to take Lima, who had made only 84
pitches, out of the game after the Tigers began to hit the
righthander hard in the fifth and sixth innings. Lima allowed four
runs and 10 hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost every hitter that came up was hitting the ball the last
two innings (off him),'' Dierker said. ``I felt like he was just on
the edge of the same sort of disaster that befell the bullpen
pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``(But) at least he was throwing strikes. Throw strikes and
you've got a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Lima did not second-guess Dierker's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't go any further,'' Lima said. ``I was making some
pretty quality pitches out there, but they were hitting them. It
seems like everything I throw is being hit. It's like I'm telling
them what pitch is coming.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers took the lead in the second when Palmer doubled and
scored on Ausmus' single.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros answered with four in the fourth off Tigers starter
Willie Blair, highlighted by Tony Eusebio's two-run homer over the
420-foot mark in center field.
</P>
<P>
   Eusebio is only the third opposing player to hit a ball to the
deepest part of Comerica Park. Alou, who had two or more hits for
the fifth straight game to raise his average to .367, had an RBI
single, and Richard Hidalgo added a sacrifice fly, but Alou was
doubled off base by Higginson.
</P>
<P>
   Two batters later, Eusebio homered. Hidalgo hit his team-leading
25th home run in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you score this many runs you're supposed to win,'' Dierker
said.

TEAMMATES TRY TO DEFLECT ATTENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pitcher Rod Beck, who is on the disabled list, was in the Red
Sox clubhouse when Carl Everett finally made his way back there
after his second-inning ejection Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, he was a little ragged,'' Beck said.
</P>
<P>
   Beck, a 10-year veteran, has some knowledge of Everett's
reputation for anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to get into that,'' he said. ``It doesn't
pertain to this, to tell you the truth. He's here now. For the most
part since he's been here, everybody knows he's outspoken, but
since he's been here he's been a pretty solid citizen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll give him the benefit of the doubt. We're his teammates.
We're behind him. What else are you going to do? I would hope if I
went off like that, teammates would be behind me. Sometimes, your
emotions get the better of you.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long season. If you play enough years, you're going to
have an incident or two.''
</P>
<P>
   Beck believed the umpires may have discussed Everett's
positioning in the batter's box after the game Friday night, when
Mets lefthander Dennis Cook pointed out to plate umpire Marty
Foster where Everett was standing.
</P>
<P>
   Rule 6.03 in the Official Playing Rules states: ``No part of the
batter's foot is to be closer than 6 inches from the side of home
plate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rules are rules,'' Beck said. ``It's pretty cut and dry. It
says 6 inches. I can't throw 6 inches in front of the rubber. That
doesn't mean I haven't done it.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Sox players kept their distance from Everett during his
outburst, except for Jose Offerman, who joined coaches Tommy Harper
and Wendell Kim in their attempts to restrain the player. Batting
coach Jim Rice, perhaps the one person in a Sox uniform physically
qualified to handle a player of Everett's strength, sat on the
dugout steps.
</P>
<P>
   Harper, who two weeks ago in Chicago pulled a cursing Everett
away from Globe columnist Dan Shaughnessy in the visiting clubhouse
at Comiskey Park, did not want to address Everett's behavior. He
did, however, understand why Everett had become angry when plate
umpire Ronald Kulpa made an issue of how close Everett was standing
to home plate, twice drawing a line in the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was standing in the same spot last night; he's been hitting
from the same spot all year,'' Harper said. ``You can't have a
different batter's box game to game. The other part, you'll have to
ask Carl.''
</P>
<P>
   Once Everett finally was hauled into the Sox dugout, veteran
Bret Saberhagen made an effort to talk to him.
</P>
<P>
   The presumption is that Saberhagen was attempting to calm him.
``No, I was trying to get him to go back on the field,'' Saberhagen
said sarcastically. ``That was something between him and me. Write
what you guys want to write. I have no comment on Carl. It's
unfortunate what happened, that's the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   Ace pitcher Pedro Martinez also attempted to deflect attention
away from Everett, even though the club is likely to lose its
leading home run hitter and RBI man for at least five games,
pending a decision by Frank Robinson, the major league official in
charge of on-field discipline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't make a big deal about it, guys,'' Martinez said to
reporters. ``Come on, guys, pick us up. Write about the game. It
doesn't matter. Don't just write the negative stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Wakefield, the team's player representative, agreed. ``A guy
got thrown out. Big deal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Mike Stanley, whose word carries considerable weight in
the Sox clubhouse, said Everett has not been a negative influence
on the team. ``He hasn't been loud or boisterous in the clubhouse.
Most of his snaps have been against himself, when he hits himself
in the head.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett has a habit of being one of the last players to arrive
in the clubhouse, well after the time stipulated by manager Jimy
Williams. ``That might be between him and Jimy,'' Stanley said,
``but it's not something disrupting the clubhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Eckersley, the former Sox reliever who was with Oakland
in the 1990 playoffs when Roger Clemens had his notorious meltdown
with umpire Terry Cooney, worked Saturday on the Sox radio
broadcast. Eckersley said this incident couldn't compare because so
much more was at stake when Clemens lost it.
</P>
<P>
   He also said displays such as Everett's have been commonplace
for years. ``But nowadays, with so much TV, you see a lot of guys
looking (stupid).''
</P>
<P>
   The worst he's seen for losing composure? ``Frank Robby,''
Eckersley said, ``and he's the guy giving out the suspensions. I
don't want to single out Frank, but he was tough. When he got
(angry) at an umpire, you knew it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you know what I was surprised at? Derek Bell coming in,''
Eckersley said, referring to the Mets outfielder's attempt to
intervene. ``What was that? That looks weak . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing when a guy on another team gets hurt and you're
worried about your buddy, but that's not cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who contended the Mets were behind the umpires'
decision to make an issue of where Everett stood in the box, was
asked if he had concerns about Everett's temper.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, not really, This is the first time somebody's done
something like drawing a line in the batter's box. He just reacted,
that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   He was asked if Everett's reaction was justified.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll have to talk to Carl,'' he said. ``You certainly don't
like to see a player ejected.''

Woods would love to complete sweep at St. Andrews
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ Arnold Palmer never did it. Neither did Sam
Snead, Tom Watson, Byron Nelson or Billy Casper.
</P>
<P>
   This week, where the game of golf began so many centuries ago,
Tiger Woods gets the chance to do what only a foursome of people
have done before _ win all of golf's modern grand-slam tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   And since he hasn't even reached his 25th birthday yet, it could
be a crowning moment for Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that I've always wanted to do,'' Woods said.
``And to be able to have the chance to do it at the home course
where golf all started, that's what anyone would want. It would be
great to complete the Slam at St. Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ironic that it's happened this year, to have two of the
greatest sites you can ever play on _ Pebble Beach in the U.S. Open
and to hopefully complete the Slam at St. Andrews, that's what you
always want. And for me to be in that position, I'm very lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   No, just very, very good. Woods is trying to join Gene Sarazen,
Ben Hogan, Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus as the only people who
have won all four of golf's modern majors _ the Masters, U.S. Open,
British Open and PGA. Nobody has won them in the same year.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Jones, of course, won the Grand Slam in one year _ 1930 _
when it consisted of the U.S. and British Opens and Amateurs.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, not everybody is conceding Woods will complete the
Slam in fairy-tale fashion at St. Andrews' famed Old Course. He is
a value wager at 5-2 in the British bookie parlors.
</P>
<P>
   But many others seem sure Woods' game is tailor-fitted to the
wide expanses of St. Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Tiger Woods doesn't win the Open, there should be a
stewards' inquiry,'' said Sir Michael Bonallack, the recently
retired secretary of the Royal &AMP; Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   This is no horse race. And would they have reason to suspect
hanky-panky when Secretariat is 31 lengths ahead of the field?
</P>
<P>
   Woods set the tone for things when he arrived in Ireland on
Monday. He was coming off his worst showing in months, finishing
well down the list at the Advil Western Open on Sunday and then
traveling all night to get to Ireland on Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of hours later, he was teeing off in the first round of
a two-day charity pro-am. All he did that day was break the course
record with a 64.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have any problem with the way I struck the ball in
Chicago,'' Woods said. ``The problem was that I putted horribly. I
putted so badly, it's a joke. But I putted pretty bad before the
U.S. Open, too.''
</P>
<P>
   And we all know how that came out. Woods stomped the field by 15
shots at Pebble Beach and now, after a suitable rest period, we
suspect Woods is ready for another feast. He typically chows down
on records and fellow touring pros whenever the big tournaments
present themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been too busy taking it easy,'' Woods said, using a
suitable oxymoron to explain his time since Pebble Beach.
</P>
<P>
   There was time spent celebrating, and, yes, the champagne does
taste better when you drink it out of the U.S. Open trophy. And,
now that he has come to the U.K., he's not about to let anything
get in the way of getting ready for the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, OK. Maybe he will let one thing get in the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm over here to enjoy the fishing,'' Woods said. ``That's the
best thing about coming over here early for the Open Championship.
You can take some time for fishing and play a few of the wonderful
courses over here.''
</P>
<P>
   None of which is more wonderful than the Old Course, of course.
His appearance this year at the British Open is causing almost as
much of a stir as the flap between Mark James and Nick Faldo, who
have warred about the contents of James' book Into the Bear Pit for
the past several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Tournament organizers at Loch Lomond were aghast when Woods'
appearance at the Limerick Golf Club on Monday drew extensive
coverage while the pro-am for the Loch Lomond, which is a premier
event on the European Tour, drew nary a mention in the British
papers.
</P>
<P>
   During the charity pro-am event, a chance to play with Woods and
Mark O'Meara at the pair's home course in Orlando, Fla., was
auctioned off for slightly more than one million pounds. That is
close to $1.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   One tabloid said Woods playing at the rather nondescript
Limerick Club was ``like the Pope dropping in to give a sermon at
your local church.''
</P>
<P>
   And competitors who are readying themselves for the British Open
are showing their respect for Woods in many ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never had someone as dominant as Tiger, not in my
career anyway,'' said Colin Montgomerie. ``This is all very new,
this complete dominance by one player. And we all know that we've
got a battle on our hands with his ambition and his will. If that
stays with him, we've got a battle on our hands every week.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not every week. Fortunately, for the rest of golfdom,
Woods plays fewer than half the events on the PGA Tour schedule.
</P>
<P>
   When you win virtually all of them you tee up in, you can take
off whenever you want. It's one of the perks of the job.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie, by the way, already has won one award from Woods
leading up to this major _ most melodramatic performance. It was
Montgomerie who has said that, were he to win his first major at
St. Andrews, he likely ``would retire from the game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've won a major at St. Andrews, where else is there to
go but down?'' he said. ``I might rather retire and be done with
this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie wasn't more than half-serious when he said that. But
he has the mood pegged pretty well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger has set this incredible standard, and everybody's trying
to emulate him,'' Faldo said. ``Golf is going to improve. It has
to. It's going to take a few years, but he's going to drive these
kids to a new level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God I'm retiring.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, so that's the word that the Brits use for what we call
Tigeritis _ the avoidance of tournaments in which Woods is playing.
</P>
<P>
   With the passing of players like Faldo, Fred Couples, Greg
Norman and others who are well into their 40s, it will be left to
the youngsters like Spain's Sergio Garcia, Australia's Aaron
Baddeley and Adam Scott and perhaps a new crop of American
collegians such as Matt Kuchar, Charles Howell or the University of
Houston's Andy Sanders to try to draw a bead on Woods.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean others in their prime won't have their
moments. Phil Mickelson, Ernie Els, Jesper Parnevik, David Duval
and others have plenty of golf ahead.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, there is only Tiger when it comes to talking about
the golf's reigning superstar for the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   To appreciate the fact that he has a chance to complete the
career Slam before his 25th birthday, consider that Nicklaus didn't
do it until after he had turned 26.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Woods hasn't done it yet. But you get the feeling by
the end of next weekend, he will be in the history books with the
current Fab Four. One thing is certain: Woods is not in any way,
shape or form worried about anybody else on the golf course this
week other than himself. He was asked recently if there was
anything that intimidated him. His response?
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe stepping into the ring with Mike Tyson,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad for the others at the British Open that Tyson won't be
inside these ropes this week.

NAVRATILOVA INDUCTED INTO HALL OF FAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ She got slam-dunked by a basketball player. It
hurt, but it eventually made the difference on her own kind of
court. A pivotal difference, you might say.
</P>
<P>
   Martina Navratilova is describing her epiphany as a tennis
player: ``I was almost 26. It was 1981. I'd already won Wimbledon
twice, but this year I got beat in the semifinals (by another
Czech, Hana Mandlikova), and I thought I was a failure. So did my
friend and coach, Nancy Lieberman.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, an all-timer of college and pro basketball, told
Navratilova, ``You're wasting your talent, not working hard, and
you're getting older. It's disgraceful. You could be the best ever
if you'd shape up. But it'll soon be too late.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nancy was absolutely right,'' said Martina, who overcame her
love affair with the International House of Pancakes and other
diversions and became quite possibly the best ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was late to really start with a new outlook. But Nancy sold
me on total commitment to the game. I went to the gym and started
working out seriously. She worked me harder than I ever imagined.
I'd been irresponsible, but I changed, thanks to her burning me.''
</P>
<P>
   From that point on, a spare, finely-tuned Navratilova was
fast-breakingly ferocious and unstoppable, a one-woman assault wave
who Saturday washed up at the edge of Narragansett Bay long enough
to accept sporting canonization at the International Tennis Hall of
Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Completing the Class of 2000, two other saints, Aussie Mal
Anderson and Judge Robert Kelleher, marched into the Casino and
onto God's own sod: the grass court where Dick Sears won the
initial US Championship in 1881. Anderson, a successor to Sears as
the US champ in 1957 (the first to win the title unseeded), helped
his homeland win two Davis Cups, widely separated, in 1957 and
1973.
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher ``should be thanked by every professional tennis player
living,'' lauded his presenter, Billie Jean King. ``When the judge
was president of the US Tennis Association, he gave the big push
needed to make open tennis a reality in 1968. Instead of peanuts we
were getting under the table as amateurs, it was prize money on top
of the table, and the game took off. Thanks, Bob.''
</P>
<P>
   But Martina was the event's drawing card, the attraction _
``Martina the Magnificent,'' her presenter, Dr. Renee Richards,
declared to enthusiastic applause from the nearly 4,000 admirers
who filled the venerable amphitheater despite the threat of rain on
a somber, wind-chilled afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   As her mother, Jana Navratilova, beamed from a nearby chair,
Martina recalled her small-town days in Revnice, a leafy village
outside Prague. She was the romantic catalyst in bringing her
divorced mom together with her beloved stepfather, Mirek Navratil.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would fill a wheelbarrow with clay to take to the courts at
the small club,'' Martina said. ``He gave me rides on the
wheelbarrow when I was 3. Then when I was older, he took me onto
the court to show me the game. My mom and I both fell for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``To play at the club, kids paid their dues by doing 20 hours of
work _ weed-pulling, rolling, watering, lining the courts. My
grandmother and my mother made me eat carrot salad all the time _
good for the eyesight, they said.''
</P>
<P>
   Also nearby was Martina's angel, Jan Kodes, a Wimbledon and
French Open champ and Hall of Famer himself. ``Jan had standing in
Czechoslovakia,'' Navratilova said, ``and he talked the tennis
federation into letting me go to the US Open in 1975'' _ where she
defected. ``They weren't going to let me out of the country again;
I was too independent. But Jan was persuasive, thank God. And at
risk to himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``My one regret is that I had to make that choice. I didn't want
to leave my home and family, but it was the only way I could
develop as a player and person.''
</P>
<P>
   Kodes smiled at the memory. ``Did you see the Martina exhibit in
the Hall?'' he asked. ``Those nine silver Wimbledon plates, one for
each championship. She should give a dinner party.'' Serving carrot
salad?
</P>
<P>
   Kodes had other fond memories. ``Do you remember that wonderful
party in Revnice?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Very well. That was 1990. Czechoslovakia was liberated at last,
six months after the ``Velvet Revolution'' trashed Communism, and
Martina was making her first trip to her transformed homeland, now
a free country. She had appeared in Prague in 1986, a member of the
US Federation Cup team, but it was an uneasy visit.
</P>
<P>
   Shadowed by secret police, she was considered a ``non-person,''
a criminal though protected by her 1981 US citizenship. Her friends
were chary about making contact. But in 1990 she was joyously
received at a bash at the little tennis club where it all began.
Music resounded from a four-piece band. Wine and beer cascaded, so
much so that the Globe correspondent was even singing in Czech.
</P>
<P>
   Martina danced with everybody, sang, and made a speech.
Everybody wept. ``It was the first time in 15 years that the
family, my parents, my sister (Jana), and I were all together,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   A spirited woman of charities and causes, she also declared, ``I
will continue speaking out on behalf of gays and lesbians until we
have equal access and protection under the law. Vermont is a start,
but it's a small state. I couldn't be open until I got my
citizenship. They would have refused a lesbian naturalization.''
</P>
<P>
   She saluted all her coaches present _ Richards, Lieberman, King,
Craig Kardon, and numerous others, including George Parma, a Czech,
the first.
</P>
<P>
   ``They suffered with me, and they have my thanks. My thanks to
all my old girlfriends, wherever they are. They suffered, too,''
she said, chuckling. Martina also cited Pam Shriver, with whom she
shared 20 major doubles titles, a record, and made a 1984 Grand
Slam. ``One of our records they'll never break, Pam, is the 109
straight wins, 1984-85,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can she not be called the greatest?'' Shriver asked.
``Unimaginable numbers _ 167 singles, 165 doubles titles _ and the
fact that for 20 straight years she was in the top four, most of
the time No. 1 or 2.''
</P>
<P>
   Pam remembered Martina's first US Open singles triumph in 1983,
on her 11th try. ``I hugged her and congratulated her. `It's been a
long wait for a great player,' '' Shriver said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what she said? `Bitch! If you hadn't beaten me in the
1978 semis, I'd have done it a lot sooner.' ''

IVERSON USING LITTLE EFFORT TO DODGE 76ERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sixers president Pat Croce was at the team's free agent camp
Friday morning and saw many familiar faces. He didn't see the one
he hoped to see, however: Allen Iverson's.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson wasn't required to be at the camp and, in fact, many
veterans don't bother with such summer inconveniences. But only a
week earlier, Croce and Magic Johnson met with Iverson in Virginia
and told him it might be a good idea if he showed. A few veterans
did show Friday. Iverson did not.
</P>
<P>
   As marquee free agents continue to come and go, and be wined and
dined, the Philadelphia Story, Summer 2000, is developing into a
soap opera. At its core are Iverson, the talented but perpetually
tardy point guard, and longtime coach Larry Brown, who happens to
believe players should be on time and work hard at practice.
</P>
<P>
   You think Rick Pitino and Antoine Walker are at each other?
They're Torvill and Dean compared with these two.
</P>
<P>
   Things have been simmering and boiled over last week. Iverson
said he thought it would be ``very hard '' to go through another
season with Brown. The coach fired back, telling reporters, ``I
wonder what your relationship would be with any employee you might
have who doesn't choose to come to work on time, or who doesn't
choose to come to work at all, who doesn't choose to do the things
everybody else in the organization does, and then says he's upset
with the way he's being treated.''
</P>
<P>
   Wow. The generally upbeat Croce has had to play the role of
mediator and said he is, at best, ``cautiously optimistic'' about
the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to be a stimulator,'' Croce said. ``What Larry says
is very valid. He has developed a system and a precedent that
works. Allen has a way of doing things his way. All I can say is
I'm hoping. I'm hoping.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Sixers assistant John Calipari, a certified Brownophile,
had a front row view of the relationship last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to be coached, taught, and learn that it's all
about team, then you'll love to play for Larry Brown. He's the best
I've ever seen,'' said Calipari. ``Allen Iverson is one of the
finest offensive players in the league. He's an average defensive
player who doesn't put a premium on it. If he ever did commit to
the game, he could be a great one.''
</P>
<P>
   Croce said one positive sign is Iverson is working out this
summer. That's apparently a first. Said Croce, ``He told me I'd be
surprised when training camp began. I said, `Surprised?' He said,
`You'll see. Just wait.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Does that mean he will be on time? Does that mean he will
follow the team's directions? I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Calipari, ``It's not easy when someone is asking you to do
things that you'd rather not do. And asking you to do those things
every day. Therein lies the issue. Allen doesn't want to deal with
it and Larry ain't gonna change. The light bulb just hasn't gone on
yet for Allen.''
</P>
<P>
   And Brown?
</P>
<P>
   ``His chronological age (59) is not important. He's younger than
I am,'' said the 41-year-old Calipari. ``He comes every day with
high energy. The only thing different from 20 years ago is that his
hair is a little shorter and a little grayer. That's it. He has
been great for Allen Iverson. I was there. But Allen has to realize
that, too. He has to be committed like Larry is.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been players over the years that loathed practice but
showed up when the games began. Croce said while Iverson might be
one of those lads, he needs to be more.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not enough,'' Croce said. ``We are a team. We have to
practice as a team. That's the way Larry Brown sees it and that's
the way it has to be. Larry has this saying: perfect practice makes
perfect. He's right.''
</P>
<P>
   Could the Sixers trade Iverson? Sure they could. He's still a
base-year player, meaning Philly could only get back player(s)
making less than Iverson's $10.125 million salary. Brown sounds at
times as if he'd take Scooter Barry even-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it works out for them, I really do,'' Calipari said.
``But if they offered him up and I was on another team, I'd take
the chance. There are five organizations right now who need a big
change. Allen has a big heart. And he fills the building.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is, what building will he fill next season?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Let games begin
</P>
<P>
   The second Shaw's Summer League opens Monday afternoon at
UMass-Boston with some interesting names and faces scheduled to be
in attendance. Ten teams have committed and there are some familiar
lads on the rosters: Tyus Edney (Washington), Damon Jones (New
Jersey), Wayne Turner (Indiana), Dontae Jones (Indiana), Randell
Jackson (New York), and Scoonie Penn (Atlanta). The Celtics had an
intriguing name on their roster, Bobby Hurley. The former Kings
guard, who last played in 1997-98, was a late scratch. ``He's
rehabbing and he's still not in shape,'' Celtics general manager
Chris Wallace said. ``It would have been a perfect opportunity for
him.'' Hurley may try to land in someone's veterans camp this fall.
Also on hand will be Kris Clack, last year's No. 2 pick (55th
overall). Only one Celtic from last year's team is scheduled to
compete: Tony Battie. The team had hoped to have Adrian Griffin,
but he isn't ready after late-spring ankle surgery . . . Hornets
backup center Brad Miller says the Celtics are one of a handful of
teams who've shown some interest, but the Hornets have the upper
hand in their dealings with the ex-Purdue big man. Charlotte can
match any offer up to the NBA average salary, about $4 million a
season. Most teams pursuing Miller have the $2.25 million exception
available. Miller, who went undrafted, earned $385,000 last season,
so he's due for a big raise. The Hornets, meanwhile, have yet to
present an offer to Eddie Jones, who has been courted by Miami,
Orlando, and Chicago. Charlotte has a history of not paying its key
guys (see Larry Johnson, Alonzo Mourning, Glen Rice, Vlade Divac),
so the Jones situation will be interesting. The Hornets also, in
retrospect, blew a chance to have an additional exception available
this summer. Charlotte could have gone into the summer with a $2.1
million slot, which represents half of the salary of the late Bobby
Phills. But the Hornets wasted it on Dale Ellis, who was unwanted
and unhappy in Milwaukee and did next to nothing for the Hornets .
. . Speaking of injury exceptions, the Nets may have one for Kerry
Kittles of nearly $4 million and, given Kittles's uncertain future,
may use it to get Ron Mercer. Jersey needs someone who can shoot
the ball. The Celtics had a chance to use half of Greg Minor's
salary ($1.4 million last year) as an injury exception, but decided
against it. The question is why? You can always apply for an
exception, but that doesn't mean you have to use it. That figure
might have enabled them to bring in a veteran to help in the locker
room. ``We just felt it wasn't necessary,'' Wallace said. There
still is no firm word on Minor's future. This is the last year of
his contract and, given that he was still walking with a cane last
spring, it doesn't look promising . . . Pitino says he has no
interest in the Delaware opening.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rookie reruns
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics were delighted and surprised to see Vin Baker for
workouts with their summer league team in California. Baker, who
has had back-to-back bummer years for the Sonics, is practicing
with the team, lifting weights, and doing conditioning drills. He
told the Seattle Times, ``That's one of the reasons I came down
here. It's just like being a rookie again. Just to walk in the gym
with those guys who have to work extra hard to make it in the
league. That's my whole mentality right now. Don't focus on
anything else. Just focus on what got me here. Busting my butt like
I did out of the University of Hartford. Just starting all over
again.'' Baker is a member of the 2000 Olympic Team . . . ESPN.com
asked visitors to vote on which key member of the Celtics needed to
be replaced for the team to succeed. Four options were given:
Antoine Walker, Vitaly Potapenko (we don't know how he got in
there), Kenny Anderson or Pitino. The winner: Anderson with 34
percent of the more than 2,700 votes. Potapenko was next with 28.4
percent while Walker (18.9) and Pitino (18.4) were basically
deadlocked . . . As Detlef Schrempf contemplates retirement _ he
turns 38 in January _ he may soon get an offer from Greek
powerhouse Panathinaikos. Since Schrempf has German citizenship,
he's not viewed as a foreigner in Europe . . . Croce said he was
very concerned about losing Brown to North Carolina when he took a
call from Carolina kingmaker Dean Smith. ``I didn't know what he
was calling about because I didn't know that Roy (Williams) had
turned the job down,'' Croce said. ``But I knew Larry had this
dream and I'm not a guy who busts up another guy's dream.'' . . .
Free agent center/forward Adonal Foyle, also of interest to the
Celtics, has been working out daily at the Golden State Warriors
practice facility and plans to attend Pete Newell's Big Man Camp.
The Warriors are thin up front and have told Foyle they want him
back. Foyle told the San Francisco Chronicle, ``I'm not afraid to
hide the fact that at first I didn't think they would offer me a
contract. What the Warriors are doing now, I like that. This is a
very interesting place to play. I'd love to be a part of it.'' One
reason Foyle is happier: the presence of Dave Cowens . . . Reports
out of California indicate Jerry West is going to resign. West says
he is under contract through September and is off to Alaska to do
some fishing. Indications seem to point to a departure from the
only professional organization he has ever known. West always said
he wanted to go out on top. He's there now.

ARMSTRONG SADDLED WITH TOUGH CONDITIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIANCON, France _ The people riding in the lifts high above the
ski areas in the southern Alps had a great view of the racers
heading north in the Tour de France. The sightseers could view the
majestic mountains, some of them covered with snow, the puffy
clouds in the bright blue sky, and the long line of cyclists on the
roads below.
</P>
<P>
   The thousands of fans lining the route, from the man wearing a
Texas flag like a cape running next to the riders to the campers on
the mountainside, seemed to be having a fun summer day.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Armstrong had an entirely different view.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a long day, it was a hard day,'' said Armstrong. ``It
was a hard day for everybody. That's a long time to be on your
bike.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost eight hours, to be exact.
</P>
<P>
   But sore or not, the defending champion held on to the overall
leader's yellow jersey that he has worn since Tuesday, as he
finished the 14th stage in seventh place, 2 minutes 51 seconds
behind winner Santiago Botero of Colombia. Botero rode the 155
miles, the longest stage of the Tour, in 7:56:13.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel so good the first half and I don't know why,''
said Armstrong, who still has a lead of 4:55 over German Jan
Ullrich entering the last week of the race. Maybe it was the three
mountains the cyclists had to pedal up and down. The first two were
designated ``first category'' and the final one was the highest
category in the Tour, as it was a 7.2 percent grade for 14
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong obviously felt better in the second half, as he took
off on the last climb with nine riders. There was no way the group
was going to catch Botero, but they put on a show of their own as
Armstrong and Italian rival Marco Pantani kept trading places for
the lead in the pack.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the two traded words, and they looked more like
friends than rivals. But Armstrong just shrugged when asked what
the exchange was all about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today he was really flying, and I told him that,'' he said.
``I was working hard to stay with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, who is more than 10 minutes ahead of Pantani, could
afford to be gallant, and said he didn't care if it seemed like he
was motivating his competitor. Pantani finished third, just two
seconds in front of Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be motivating (but) it's the gentlemanly thing to do,
to say, `Hey, you're strong,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong also seems not to care whether he's won a stage as
long as he's in the overall lead. Last year he won four stages in
the Tour, but if he doesn't win one this week, he'll become the
first person since Greg Lemond in 1990 to win the Tour without
winning one of the days' races.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our objective is to keep the yellow jersey,'' said Armstrong
of his US Postal Service team. ``So if there's a breakaway that
doesn't affect the overall standings, it's OK. If 10 guys who are
10 minutes back take off, we let them go.''
</P>
<P>
   Botero, 27, called Saturday's victory ``the biggest win of my
career.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Colombia is experiencing a very serious political crisis, so
I'm happy to have brought a positive note to the country,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Botero is just the fifth Colombian to win a Tour stage.
</P>
<P>
   The racers will leave Briancon, just 20 miles from the Italian
border, Sunday as they cover three more mountains and head farther
north into the Alps.
</P>
<P>
   Which is little comfort to Armstrong, even though he holds the
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be difficult because today was so long and hard,'' he
said. ``It'd be nice to ride 74 kilometers.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How different is riding in the Tour de France than watching it
on television?
</P>
<P>
   A lot, testified Steve Pucci, of West Newbury, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``On TV, you don't get all the feel of the crowds, the terrain,
all the idiots like us,'' Pucci said  &UR; yesterday &LR;  as he took a break
from pedaling up the Col de Vars.
</P>
<P>
   Pucci has a personal attachment to the Tour as friend and former
teammate and coach of Tyler Hamilton, of Marblehead, Mass., who is
in 33d place overall. Pucci, 51, has been in France for the past
week with other members of the Newbury-based CCB team, riding parts
of the Tour.

RUSH OUT TO PROVE EXPERTS WRONG 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALTHAM _ After all the adulation, expectations, and improper
gifts heaped upon JaRon Rush, his introduction to the NBA received
surprisingly little notice.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a green Celtics practice jersey, he worked out Friday
with the Boston summer league team as an undrafted player. He
declined to discuss why he slipped off the draft boards of all 29
teams, preferring to distance himself from the past. Far from the
fame that surrounded him growing up in Kansas City, Mo., and the
controversy that found him at UCLA, Rush was certain he deserved a
spot on an NBA roster.
</P>
<P>
   As with other players participating in the Boston summer league,
Rush must reestablish himself as someone with the skills and
character to succeed in the NBA. He must convince scouts the
personal problems are behind him. For an undrafted player such as
Rush, the NBA season effectively starts now as he tries to quiet
critics, erase doubts, and escape the pressures of being tagged a
professional prospect as a teenager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to come in and surprise a lot of people,'' said
Rush. ``Because I wasn't drafted and people didn't get to see me a
lot in college, they don't really know what I can do. If a lot of
people give me the opportunity, I think I'll go out and prove them
wrong. I'll prove that I should have been very high. I'm just out
to prove people wrong. Right now, I'm just dedicating myself to
playing hard and making somebody's roster.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the draft, many scouts predicted Rush would be selected
in the first round. At 6 feet 7 inches, 207 pounds, Rush possesses
decent size. During a truncated career as a forward at UCLA, he
showed great athletic ability and defensive skills. And entering
the selection process at 21, he was a player with the proverbial
``upside.''
</P>
<P>
   But the 2000 draft concluded without his name being called, and
Rush cried. A group of family and friends had gathered in Kansas
City for the biggest moment of his basketball life, and it never
came. Shocked, Rush reevaluated his plans and prepared for summer
league play.
</P>
<P>
   Rush arrived in Boston with an optimistic outlook. He was
thankful for another shot at the NBA, the latest in a string of
second chances. He hoped to fulfill the promise he showed as a
youngster, before life became complicated and everyone wanted to
share in his anticipated good fortune. In his hometown, he has been
awarded a celebrity status that can be difficult to deal with,
especially when expectations are high and past indiscretions
surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get frustrated sometimes because every little thing got
looked at there (in Kansas City),'' said Rush. ``I kind of like it,
but I kind of don't. There was too much trouble there, so it really
helped to go out to UCLA.''
</P>
<P>
   The trouble started when Rush was a high school basketball star,
playing for a summer league coach named Myron C. Piggie. On several
occasions, Piggie gave his players money, stripping Rush and others
of their college eligibility because they could no longer be
considered amateurs. According to the findings of an NCAA
investigation, Piggie gave Rush $6,325 in compensation. When Rush
later falsified NCAA paperwork at UCLA and claimed he never
accepted payments to play basketball, he defrauded the university.
Without knowing it, the Bruins were using an ineligible player.
Rush also admitted he took money from a Los Angeles-based agent.
</P>
<P>
   Once revelations about payments made to players surfaced, Rush
and UCLA faced stiff penalties from the NCAA. Rush received the
harshest punishment. Two suspensions forced him to miss 24 games as
a sophomore. Originally, a 29-game suspension in addition to a
15-game suspension meant Rush could not play for UCLA until
2000-01. However, the program appealed the lengthier suspension and
it was reduced to nine games, allowing Rush to compete at the end
of last season.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rush factored the NCAA sanctions into his decision to
declare early for the draft. In college, with the NCAA
investigating his past, Rush felt he did not have control of his
career. The uncertainty of the NCAA's next move made him nervous.
He thought it would be better to take his chances with the NBA,
rather than the NCAA. Also, Rush was not comfortable at UCLA,
believing its style of play did not best suit his talents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look at it as a bad decision,'' said Rush, of
accepting money from Piggie. ``I just look it as a guy trying to
help some young people out, which is done all over America. This
situation, he got a little bit too greedy. But if I had to go back
and do it all again, I don't think I would . . . I know some people
cared about me and some people didn't. I know who to trust and who
not to trust now. It's going to be very hard to get close to me
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Rush matured during the suspensions. Watching his teammates from
the bench, he was reminded how much basketball meant to him. When
he came back at the end of the season, Rush made sure his presence
made a difference. UCLA suffered without Rush at forward. After
all, he finished his freshman season as the Bruins' leading
rebounder (7.3 per game) and third-leading scorer (11.4 points per
game).
</P>
<P>
   Appropriately, Rush's return spearheaded the Bruins' biggest win
of the season. With Rush in the lineup, UCLA upset then-No. 1
Stanford. In 26 minutes, he scored a season-high 19 points,
including the winning jumper with three seconds remaining in
overtime. Rush dominated the extra period, scoring 8 of the Bruins'
14 points. The victory helped salvage UCLA's season and put the
school in position for an NCAA tournament berth.
</P>
<P>
   Rush's comeback performance proved the suspensions only took
away time, not talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has tremendous character, tremendous work ethic, tremendous
athleticism,'' said his agent, Raymond Brothers, who also
represents Celtics free agent Danny Fortson. ``He is a tremendous
basketball player. People I was talking to thought he would be
between 10 and 25 in the first round of the draft. Had he stayed in
college, a lot of general managers said he could have been a
lottery pick easy. And a lot of teams didn't get to see him play.
Without JaRon, UCLA doesn't make the tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Celtics general manager Chris Wallace: ``The draft works in
strange and mysterious ways sometimes. How did Paul Pierce get to
10? It just happens. He came out very early and was projected
late-first. When you're late-first, anything can happen. But he's
in a more advantageous spot than if he went any place other than
the first round because he can pick and choose his teams now. We're
happy he slid. Now we get to look and see him this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than five minutes after the draft concluded, the Celtics
called Brothers and expressed their interest. Brothers encouraged
Rush to play for the Celtics at the Boston summer league, believing
his client's strengths fit the Celtics' style. Wallace projects
Rush will move from forward to shooting guard to create better
matchups. With his size and lean build, long-term success for Rush
more likely will come as an off-guard.
</P>
<P>
   Making an NBA team would give Rush the stability his life has
been lacking. He noted that starting his NBA career at 21 was an
assertion that he controlled his fate. The mistakes and
disappointment of the past have made him more patient and more
certain about his future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier to focus now. (NBA teams) know I have a lot of
potential. I'm very young,'' said Rush, who hopes to have an NBA
career that lasts a decade or longer. ``Going to these summer
league games, it's all about learning and getting better. I can go
out there and play, but if I make mistakes it's because I'm still
young and I'm learning the NBA game. There's really no pressure on
me. I'm just going out there and trying to play the best I can.''

HMO - A health care meltdown in rural Arizona this summer is
forcing elderly residents to go to Mexico for affordable drugs, lie
about their addresses to maintain coverage and take menial jobs to
help pay for their care. Many retirees in rural communities are
cutting back on their medications because the HMO programs that
recently provided prescription benefits are gone. Story will move

   HMOSIDE -About 13,000 seniors are getting the boot Jan. 1 from
Medicare HMOs, the latest in a wave of exits that has pushed out

WATCH IS ON: IT'S TIME FOR CAMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Topics as varied as criminal activity, injury comebacks,
coaching changes, high-profile veterans and rookies, and serious
life issues the league's Armanis face will be among the reasons to
pay close attention as training camps open. Here are 25 people to
watch this season:
</P>
<P>
   1. Ray Lewis: Acquitted on murder charges, Lewis's highly
publicized trial will make him the curiosity factor in the league.
Steps are being taken to keep the Ravens linebacker shielded from
the media and public while he attempts to get his life back to
normal. He made an unannounced visit to the rookie symposium last
week in San Diego to warn players to be careful whom they associate
with and where they go after football hours. He could have a huge
impact on the lives of other NFL stars. But we thought that when
Rae Carruth was charged with murder, and things are still going on
around the NFL that have created a black eye for the sport.
</P>
<P>
   2. Daniel Snyder: The .com owner has created the following
situation: boom or bust. Not afraid to spend money, Snyder has
rankled some of his fellow owners, much like George Steinbrenner
used to, with his flamboyance and fiscal approach. His highly-paid
Redskins will be under a microscope, as will the staff,
particularly coach Norv Turner.
</P>
<P>
   3. Kurt Warner: The reigning NFL and Super Bowl MVP. How will he
respond when the entire league goes gunning for him? If Warner
survives, his legacy will grow.
</P>
<P>
   4. Al Groh: Anyone who replaces Bill Parcells is on the ultimate
hot seat, never mind that he is coaching in the nation's largest
media center. It helps that the system and some of the Jets
coaching staff is intact. It's the same philosophy. This is
different than the situation Pete Carroll inherited, because
Carroll had to bring in a new coaching staff and introduce his
philosophy to a team that had gone to the Super Bowl. Groh inherits
an 8-8 team.
</P>
<P>
   5. Bill Belichick: He'll receive a little more attention than
the usual first-time coach because of the odd circumstances
surrounding his hiring by the Patriots. He basically turned his
back on Parcells and the Jets, walking away from that highly
visible head job. Belichick must overcome the team's depleted
talent pool and motivate his younger players.
</P>
<P>
   6. Keyshawn Johnson: One of the best offensive players in the
game, it'll be curious to see the impact of his subtraction from
the Jets and his addition to the Tampa Bay attack. The Bucs are
considered a Super Bowl team, and they feel Johnson makes the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   7. Wade Phillips: The Bills coach's decision to bench Doug
Flutie before a playoff game, then losing to the Titans, and his
subsequent decision to start Rob Johnson, will have its
ramifications. Phillips is second-guessed more in the rest of the
country than he is in Buffalo, and he must hope the Bills'
performance this season validates his judgments.
</P>
<P>
   8. Courtney Brown: He's the No. 1 pick in the draft (of the
Browns) and all will see whether Brown can be the next Bruce Smith
or Reggie White. There'll always be debate whether Brown or Penn
State teammate LaVar Arrington was worthy of the No. 1 pick. It may
not be settled after one season.
</P>
<P>
   9. Deion Sanders: One of the most interesting and exciting
players in the game. He's changed teams again, going from Dallas to
Washington at big money (seven years, $56 million). He's had injury
issues the past couple of years, but when healthy can dominate in
the secondary and as a punt returner.
</P>
<P>
   10. Paul Tagliabue: There's no commissioner who has the business
side of his sport so controlled. His teams are making a fortune,
there's stadium expansion everywhere, and the revenue-sharing
concept has been a bonanza. But all the money in the world can't
correct the growing perception that the players are troubled people
committing crimes and running amok. The NFL has done a lot to
educate its players, but it is having trouble keeping up. It seems
there's a new tragedy every month. It's not Tagliabue's fault, but
the commissioner has to pull something brilliant out of his bag of
tricks. It's also a league that must loosen up before its followers
concur with Vince McMahon's assessment of the NFL as the ``No Fun
League.''
</P>
<P>
   11. Gene Upshaw: Despite the many gains made by the union the
past few years, there's still no balance of power between the
players' association and the league. Upshaw, the union president,
has gotten tough with corrupt agents who are stealing money from
clients and those violating the rules in structuring contracts. But
the teams are in charge. Contracts, for the most part, are a sham.
Long-term deals, where only the bonus is guaranteed, often include
such things as voidable years, escalators, and unmakeable
incentives, all to lessen the salary cap hit. Team executives bully
agents and players, telling them to be quiet about injuries and not
to reveal the sacred details of the contracts. Some of this stuff
is laughed at in the unions of the major leagues, NHL, and NBA.
</P>
<P>
   12. Terrell Davis: The best running back in the NFL returns
after missing all of last season with a knee injury. This bodes
well for the Broncos, who, coming off back-to-back Super Bowls, had
a down year without Davis and John Elway and an injured Shannon
Sharpe, who has since signed with the Ravens. The Broncos still
have a good core, are a year wiser and better with quarterback
Brian Griese, and have what many other teams don't: veteran
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   13. Jamal Anderson: Anderson's season-ending injury crippled the
Falcons, who became the biggest disappointment of the 1999 season a
year after making the Super Bowl. The Falcons could be a factor
again if Anderson comes back 100 percent, which he isn't yet, and
several free agent moves pan out.
</P>
<P>
   14. Bill Parcells: He's shopping for the groceries. The fun will
be watching whether his controversial trading of Johnson for two
No. 1s works out. We'll see how good a personnel man he really is.
If his drafted players become stars, he can add another rung to his
lofty ladder of successes.
</P>
<P>
   15. Ron Dayne: Don't be surprised if he's a star. A big, tough,
bruising runner who has made good impressions on the field in New
York, and with the Giants has an offense that's perfectly suited
for him. One of the fun things every year is to follow the Heisman
Trophy winner's transition into the NFL. Some never make it.
</P>
<P>
   16. Mike Martz: He's in one of these no-win situations, taking
over for the coach (Dick Vermeil) that won the Super Bowl. Sounds
familiar. Martz was the brain behind the Rams' high-powered
offense. He has done some tweaking with the coaching staff and the
roster. Obviously, the league is gunning for St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   17. Dennis Miller: He will either be really funny or really
annoying on ``Monday Night Football.'' It's great there's at least
an attempt to loosen things up in the broadcast booth. Too bad the
rest of the league is so boring.
</P>
<P>
   18. Sebastian Janikowski: The drafting of the former Florida
State kicker (early in the first round) was already controversial;
he's had two brushes with the law amid talk of deportation, which
apparently won't happen. Nonetheless, Janikowski's strong leg,
off-field problems, and the fact he's wearing the black and silver
of the Oakland Raiders make him someone you want to keep an eye on.
</P>
<P>
   19. Ryan Leaf: It'll be interesting if he finally gets to play
for the Chargers this season. For all of his obnoxious behavior,
could he still be a great quarterback? The Colts made the right
choice going with Peyton Manning over Leaf three years ago, just as
the Patriots did when they opted for Drew Bledsoe over Rick Mirer.
Is Leaf another Mirer? Or will Leaf emerge as a pretty good player?
</P>
<P>
   20. Shaun King: Tampa Bay has a killer defense and excellent
offensive personnel. But it's up to King to deliver the ball. The
rookie quarterback struggled at times last year, but a scout who
regularly covers the Bucs said he thinks King will be a very good
NFL quarterback and surprise his critics.
</P>
<P>
   21. Vinny Testaverde: Losing him destroyed the Jets' season last
year. If he returns in top form, with protection, and with Curtis
Martin behind him, Testaverde _ who is approaching the season as if
it's his last _ could make things exciting in New York again. One
problem: No Keyshawn to come up with tough catches over the middle.
</P>
<P>
   22. Ben Coates: The former Patriots tight end will surface in
some team's training camp. He's in the best shape in years and he's
trying to prove wrong those who feel he's all done.
</P>
<P>
   23. Shannon Sharpe: Another great pass-catcher that the game
missed last year. Sharpe returns with what should be a high-powered
offense in Baltimore, a team that could be very tough and a big
postseason factor.
</P>
<P>
   24. Akili Smith: For all the odd things the Bengals do, they
have built a pretty exciting offense and Smith will be the trigger
man, tossing it to Peter Warrick and Ron Dugans and, if he's
around, Corey Dillon out of the backfield. He should be the most
exciting of all the young QBs in the league.
</P>
<P>
   25. Drew Bledsoe: Just because he's the main guy with the local
team. Bledsoe always piques our interest. The Patriots had better
come up with more options than just Terry Glenn, whom teams are
going to swarm now that Shawn Jefferson and Coates are gone.
</P>
<P>
   Others to watch: Dallas owner Jerry Jones because he's always
exciting; Minnesota receiver Randy Moss; Tim Couch, Year 2; Glenn,
because he's so vital to the Patriots' offensive success; Colts
running back Edgerrin James, who will have to contend with teams
keying on him; Former Lions running back Barry Sanders, who may
wind up back in the league if the Lions can work out compensation;
Damon Huard-Jay Fiedler replacing Dan Marino; Ravens cornerback
Chris McAlister, who may emerge as an outstanding player; Tennessee
running back Eddie George, who has been so tough and so good; Bruce
Smith _ does he have anything left? And if he returns, the Rev.
Reggie White.
</P>
<P>

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boston's bargain hunters
</P>
<P>
   How are Belichick and Dan Duquette one in the same? They like
reclamation projects and they tell you nothing. Belichick will have
a few of them on his team, including running back Raymont Harris,
special teams player and receiver Aaron Bailey, cornerback Antonio
Langham, linebacker Chad Cascadden, and whatever reject is picked
up between now and the end of camp. Harris and Langham could have
the biggest impact if they return to their respective high points .
. . Many months later, there has not been a proper explanation as
to why strength and conditioning coach Johnny Parker was fired by
Belichick. Larry Kennan, who heads the NFL Coaches Association,
swears he's never heard a legitimate reason. ``I speak to Johnny a
lot and that still hits him hard,'' said Kennan. ``It came out of
the blue. Johnny was told several times that he had a job for life
with the Patriots.''. . . Kennan will look into how the Patriots
structured contracts for some of the assistants. Some of them have
a clause that if they're fired and they have time remaining on
their deals, the team is only liable for half the amount. Kennan
said he would balk at such a clause . . . Patriots e-commerce
manager Anthony Jardim reports sales of merchandise over the
Internet have increased 400 percent over the previous 12 months.
Every cent of the proceeds goes to the Patriots Charitable
Foundation. The auction site _ accessible via www.patriots.com or
www.proteamauctions.com _ offers fans and collectors of Patriots
memorabilia the chance to bid on and compete for authentic Patriots
merchandise (both new and game-used) along with autographed
authentic memorabilia. This week, the Patriots were offering a trip
for two to the Hall of Fame Game in Canton, Ohio, and the induction
ceremony and other Hall of Fame events when the Patriots play the
San Francisco 49ers to kick off the 2000 exhibition season. This
package includes two round-trip tickets, leaving July 28 and
returning Aug. 1 . . . Ray Lucas's agent, Felix Diaz, spilled the
beans last week to the Record (N.J.) indicating the Jets may trade
Lucas. Diaz told the newspaper that if it came down to a trade,
Parcells would try and send Lucas to a good situation. The Jets
have a healthy Testaverde and rookie first-round pick Chad
Pennington to go along with punter/QB Tom Tupa.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   He received the message
</P>
<P>
   When Vincent Brisby accepted his pay cut (with incentives to
earn $2.6 million), agent Michael George understood it was either
this way or the highway. Brisby saved the Patriots $750,000 on the
cap, saved himself a job at a high rate of pay, and enabled the
team to sign Adrian Klemm and Bruce Armstrong as well as the other
draft picks. The Patriots did well signing Klemm, forcing the
second-rounder to take on a fifth year so the team could soften its
salary cap hit. They also placed a few ``not likely to be earned''
incentives in their contracts to the lower-round rookies in lieu of
a bigger signing bonus, which caused a few of them to balk.
Contrary to reports, this did not anger the union. It did alert the
agents the team was doing this. ``It was well within their rights
to do so,'' said NFLPA spokesman Carl Francis. ``We weren't angry,
we were just making our agents aware of what was happening. I'm
sure some of the incentives are reachable if the guys play.''
Respected agent Ralph Cindrich, who represents Klemm, actually
thought the team showed a lot of class by signing Klemm now, even
though he won't be able to play throughout training camp after knee
surgery. ``I give them credit for looking past that and negotiating
a good deal for Adrian,'' said Cindrich of the five-year, $3.34
million deal with a $1.225 million signing bonus. This contract
concept was suggested by Bob Kraft many months ago at an owners
meeting. Jones followed, and now other teams are joining the ranks
. . . There is some concern about Lions coach Bobby Ross's health.
The 63-year-old has experienced blood clots in his legs this
offseason, and while they appear to be under control, He is still
experiencing them. Ross, however, isn't about to slow down. ``I'm
63, but I feel very good,'' said Ross. ``I don't feel any different
than I did at 45.'' Ross, who has two years remaining on his
five-year deal, knows he will not have Barry Sanders. Sanders has
finally returned the $1.83 million portion of his $11 million
signing bonus owed the Lions and has also sent checks to both of
his agents, Lamont Sith and David Ware, for their commissions on
the deal . . . Former Patriots vice president of personnel Bobby
Grier is settling into his new job in Houston and will be closing
on a house there shortly . . . Veteran defensive end Leslie O'Neal
will soon decide whether he'll retire or take the massive slash in
salary he accepted from the Chiefs this offseason. O'Neal went from
$3 million to $440,000.

<P>
   Bengals' strife
</P>
<P>
   There's never a dull moment covering Bengals football. Nobody
wants to go there and once they're in, they beg to leave. The
Dillon and Carl Pickens sagas are priceless. The latest is the
Bengals, who have been accused of holding Pickens hostage _
refusing to release him after several trade possibilities fell
through _ want the receiver in camp. Pickens would rather eat
soybean the rest of his life. Meanwhile, agent Marvin Demoff has
accused the Bengals of no longer negotiating a deal. The Bengals
last offered Dillon five years at $21 million, but Dillon plans to
hold out until he gets his price or until he's dealt . . . The XFL
has announced a team in Las Vegas. And now there should be no
question as to whether the games will be scripted or serious. Vegas
will list odds, which it can only do if it knows the games are
legitimate . . . Wide receiver Sean Morey has been medically
cleared to participate in the Patriots camp after battling the
effects of a seasonlong ankle injury in Barcelona. Morey made quite
an impression on NFL Europe coaches, often playing at far less than
100 percent and still looking like one of the most talented players
there . . . Patriots rookie running back J.R. Redmond's groin
injury is healing ahead of schedule and he's now awaiting clearance
to get on the field once he's signed . . . Former Holy Cross coach
Peter Vaas, who now coaches Berlin in NFL Europe, returned to his
New Hampshire home June 26 but then flew back to Hamburg last
Saturday to help coach the Notre Dame alumni to a 14-10 win over
the Hamburg Blue Devils . . . Interest in the Patriots this
offseason has been as low as it's been since the pre-Parcells era.
The true test will be Monday when camp opens and fans are allowed
to watch the two-a-days at Foxboro Stadium. By the way, the camp is
free, unlike that of the Redskins, who will charge $10 a head and
$10 for parking.

IT'S THE BRITISH OPEN, BUT IS IT WORTH IT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To go or not to go is a question that has dogged PGA Tour
players for years. We're talking the British Open, of course, that
most glorious major championship with its variety of weather and
just as many opinions about how much an American pro should
sacrifice in an effort to gain a spot.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Faxon, for one, is shelling out thousands of dollars just
for the chance to get into next week's field at St. Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Andrade, while he ``commends Brad for going,'' is of a
different mind-set, opting not to go through the rigors of
qualifying. He did it in 1989 and '90, but hasn't since, playing
only when exempt (five times since 1992).
</P>
<P>
   ``I went over and shot 6 under (in qualifying) for two days and
went home,'' said Andrade. Faxon and Andrade pointed out that
accommodations must be made for qualifying, which could be outside
of London, in addition to reservations for the British Open site.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't go over there to qualify without thinking of getting
into the Open,'' said Faxon. ``You have to get rooms. It's eight or
nine days; two weeks away from the PGA Tour.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Andrade had an apartment booked for the week, but when
he didn't qualify, he was able to hand off his accommodations to
Ian Baker-Finch and recoup some money. That helped, said Andrade,
``because it's not like they make it convenient for you.''
</P>
<P>
   The qualifying process is something the PGA Tour's Policy Board
has discussed and one of the player directors _ Hal Sutton _ said
he is sensitive to the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't play unless I'm exempt,'' said Sutton, who is in the
St. Andrews field after finishing T-10 at Carnoustie last year. For
the previous 10 British Opens, however, Sutton didn't bother to
qualify and he sympathizes with players who don't want to, either.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton would like to see a PGA Tour stop in early July _ say the
Western Open _ be a British Open qualifier, with perhaps the top 20
players not otherwise exempt earning spots.
</P>
<P>
   While he would favor such a plan and indicated ``it could
happen,'' Sutton emphasized it's still just being discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to qualify for the British Open usually requires passing
up at least two PGA Tour events, and most players can't afford to
do that, not with their name well down the money list.
</P>
<P>
   Legitimate concerns, though Faxon doesn't adhere to them. ``It's
the British Open,'' so he's at a course in England Sunday and
Monday _ London Links _ trying to nail down a spot. If he misses,
he'll come home Tuesday and head to the B.C. Open in Endicott,
N.Y., where he is the defending champion.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pleasure before business
</P>
<P>
   The growing trend for those who do have spots in the British
Open is to go over a week early, play the legendary layouts of
Ireland, and take part in some nightlife. ``We're going to go over
and play golf every day and have a lot of fun at night,'' said
Dudley Hart, who had a trip planned with Tim Herron, Jeff Sluman,
and some other friends. He rattled off some of the itinerary _
Royal County Down, Royal Dublin, Portmarnock, Old Head _ and
realized golf writers were salivating. ``It's a tough life,'' said
Hart, laughing, ``but we've gotta do it.'' Herron, listening to the
list, wasn't so sure. ``I think I'll be too tired for the British
Open,'' he said . . . Tiger Woods is another who went over early
and played in a charity event in Limerick, Ireland, with Mark
O'Meara, Stuart Appleby, and David Duval. Woods shot 64-68 to win
the JP McManus Pro-Am because Appleby (63-68) was disqualified for
using an illegal laser gauge . . . Steve Elkington and Sutton have
personal reasons for choosing a more traditional routine, showing
up on site a few days before the event. Elkington has a severe
sinus problem and said it really kicks up this time of year.
Sutton? ``With three little girls, I try to spend as much time at
home as I can.'' . . . Elkington had favorable first impressions of
two Rhode Island products _ Dana Quigley and Rhode Island CC _
during the CVS Charity Classic. He praised Quigley's game,
particularly his driving, and said, ``Now I know why he's doing so
well on the Senior Tour.'' As for RICC, ``it's my new favorite
course,'' because the short, classic layout puts a premium on the
wedge game and ``we just don't play courses like that anymore.''
Elkington and playing partner Craig Stadler were unanimous about
Quigley's passion for golf. ``I have never, ever in my life seen
anybody who loves golf as much as that guy,'' said Stadler, a
reference to the fact that Quigley has played more than 100
tournaments in a row without taking a week off. What's the most in
a row for them? ``Three,'' said Elkington, to a round of laughter.
Said Stadler: ``I played seven or eight, way back when I was too
dumb to realize.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tabloid diversions
</P>
<P>
   Of course, with the British Open comes the British tabloids. A
nauseating thought to many players, many of whom know that a
central theme will be last year's Ryder Cup Matches at The Country
Club in Brookline _ in particular the infamous celebration on the
17th green by the Americans. Because he made the dramatic 40-foot
putt that capped an improbable rally against Jose Maria Olazabal
and virtually assured victory, Justin Leonard figures to draw some
attention and said last week that he ``expects the worst and hopes
for the best, but I can't help that and I'm not going to be too
concerned with it.'' Davis Love, who played with Leonard in the CVS
Charity Classic, couldn't sit still any longer. ``Real golf fans
know what happened,'' he said. ``We played good for one day, they
played good for two. People need to go back and remember what they
thought of Saturday night. Everybody was happy. We didn't have any
complaints, they didn't have any complaints. Then, all of a sudden
Sunday, there was one incident that we have apologized for that
really didn't affect the outsome of the match _ even the players
involved knew that. And to think it changed that much from Saturday
night to Sunday is pretty amazing. What changed is we won the first
six matches and they got beat. It's a lot of sour grapes led by
their captain.'' . . . ``Their captain,'' of course, is Mark James,
who happens to be entered in the British Open. If only the pairings
people had a sense of humor, just imagine the possibilities _ James
flanked by Tom Lehman and Nick Faldo, both of whom caught the wrath
of the captain in his book . . . Saying most of the principals
involved have made peace, and that fans and writers are the ones
still stirring the pot, Leonard shook his head in disbelief. ``It's
amazing to me how personal people take things. Even people who had
nothing to do with the event. These people need to get out and read
something other than the sports page.'' . . . You don't think Woods
has any competition? Apparently you've never heard of Nedbank, as
in the large South African banking institution. It seems the powers
who run that business enjoy spending piles of cash because they
have sweetened the pot to $4.06 million for this year's Sun City
event in South Africa, which will run opposite Woods's Williams
World Challenge. Both are non-sanctioned events that attract
marquee names, but as good as these guys are, they can't be at both
tournaments, so let the decisions begin. On the one hand you have
Woods; on the other, a chance for a first-place prize of $2 million
. . . Who has the most top-10 finishes on the PGA Tour this year?
That's easy, Woods. But who is next? If you said Steve Flesch
(nine), give yourself a pat on the back.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tough competition
</P>
<P>
   It never should have happened, but the USGA elected to run its
Women's Open opposite the British Open. That's a shame for the
women, for arguably their biggest tournament of the season will get
overshadowed by Woods's run for a second straight major. The women
will be teeing it up at the Merit Club in Chicago . . . The good
news for Kim Williams: She got into this weekend's LPGA Big Apple
Classic as an alternate and grabbed a share of the first-round lead
with a 4-under 67. The bad news: She had to face more questions
about a 1994 shooting that left a bullet lodged in her right
shoulder. She was an innocent bystander in a Youngstown, Ohio,
drugstore that night, and the incident set her career back a few
years. The bullet was removed the next year, but Williams has been
plagued by one injury after another, culminated by back surgery in
late 1998 that limited her to just eight tournaments last season.
``I'd rather (people say), `The girl that won the tournament: Did
you know she got shot? Rather than, `Oh, that's the girl that got
shot,' '' said Williams, whose best finish in 11 years on Tour is
T-2.
</P>
<P>
   . . . Arthur Cicconi, the only head professional in the 24 years
of Presidents GC in Quincy, has submitted his resignation,
effective at the end of this year. He's one of the really great
people in the profession and his tireless work turned the Norfolk
County Classic into a well-respected event, which should be
commended . . . The trucks and field workers have been in place for
months, but a ceremonial ground-breaking was held Thursday for the
TPC of Boston facility in Norton. Officials from FleetBoston
Financial, the PGA Tour, and Connell Limited Partnership took part,
along with Norton town officials. It marked the official start of
construction for the golf course, which is scheduled to open in
2002, designed by the Arnold Palmer Course Design Co. Some 100
corporate memberships have been sold, said Brian Connor, director
of marketing, and just 10 remain in the charter category . . .
Entries are still being accepted for the New England Junior Open
Championship (July 24-28) at Ponkapoag GC in Canton. There are four
divisions for boys, two for girls, and the entry fee is $20. Call
the pro shop for information.

OUT OF THE BLUE, SCIOSCIA SITTING PRETTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The last local intercounty, interleague series of
the season is over, leaving Southern California baseball fans with
the question of whom you'd rather be right now.
</P>
<P>
   a) Davey Johnson or b) Mike Scioscia?
</P>
<P>
   a) The manager with the $1.5 million-a-year salary or b) the
manager getting by on Mickey Mouse money?
</P>
<P>
   a) The custodian of Dodgers tradition or b) the trustee of
Angels, uh, history?
</P>
<P>
   The answer has to be b), b), b). Scioscia, Scioscia, Scioscia.
</P>
<P>
   As they headed out of the All-Star break, the relative states of
the Dodgers and Angels could be summed up with these images:
Johnson under siege, the world coming down around his ears, and
Scioscia loose and playful, seemingly confident that any call he
made would be the right one.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia and the Angels left Dodger Stadium with two victories
in three games, including a 6-2 win in front of 42,726 grumbling
Dodgers fans Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, who began the day five games behind the Seattle
Mariners in the American League West, improved to 49-42. The
Dodgers, six games behind the Arizona Diamondbacks, dropped to
45-44. But the gap between them was bigger than that.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels and Dodgers turned the Southern California freeway
map upside down the past three days. On the I-5, south is now up,
north is now down.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dodgers manager's office, Johnson stood with hands on
hips and faced the music again.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you don't hit, you look flat. And when you don't pitch,
you look worse,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going through a little tough time. We've got a couple of
guys down (Todd Hundley, injured; Mark Grudzielanek, sick; Chad
Kreuter, suspended). It's dog-days time. We're going to get
healthier in the next couple of days. But right now I don't have a
lot of help on the bench.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not an excuse, just a fact. Johnson knows that if he
doesn't find a way to coax more out of his $90 million roster this
season, he won't have a next season to try again.
</P>
<P>
   In the Angels manager's office, Scioscia leaned back in a chair
and appeared, 91 games into his rookie season as a major-league
manager, to be completely at ease and pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's do that over,'' he said, interrupting his own interview
at one point. ``I just burped into a microphone.''
</P>
<P>
   That's about the only thing that went wrong for Scioscia in a
series that could only have been better for him if the Angels had
survived the 10th inning Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Do managers have hot streaks as hitters do? Scioscia seems to be
on one.
</P>
<P>
   He calls in left fielder Darin Erstad to form a five-man infield
after the Dodgers put a runner at third with none out in the 10th
in that first game. The ensuing ground ball goes right to Erstad.
</P>
<P>
   He moves Erstad to center field in the eighth inning Friday
night after Garret Anderson is injured. Erstad makes a diving catch
to stall a Dodgers rally.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh inning of that game, he lets pitcher Kent
Bottenfield bat with two out and the Angels down a run. Bottenfield
singles to set up a two-run Erstad homer.
</P>
<P>
   The most heartening thing for the Angels staff was that even
before Scioscia signaled for the five-man infield, Erstad was
running in, spotting the situation, knowing his manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's in sequence,'' hitting coach Mickey Hatcher said.
``That's what Mike's got going here.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia came to Dodger Stadium for the first time since he was
a Dodger. Friday night, the video board replayed his 1988 playoff
homer off Dwight Gooden, and followed that with a shot of Scioscia
in the Angels dugout, and the crowd gave him an appreciative
ovation.
</P>
<P>
   By the seventh inning Saturday, he was drawing boos when he
argued with an umpire over a play at second base. The moment seemed
to certify, for anyone who wasn't sure yet, that Scioscia is an
Angel now.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to Johnson, he's the lucky one.

COMMITTEE'S PITCH IS A CHANGEUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By GORDON EDES 
c.2000 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A baseball fan does not have to possess a long memory to
understand the significance of the report on baseball's economics
released by a panel of experts Friday, one that recommended
significantly increased revenue sharing and a luxury tax with a
much sharper bite than the one that currently exists as a way to
close the economic disparity among teams.
</P>
<P>
   It is an explicit reminder that the ugly season will soon be
upon us, one in which baseball's owners and players try to hash out
a new collective bargaining agreement against a backdrop of three
decades of work stoppages and acrimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on past experience, it is real clear that we will have
another strike or lockout,'' said Roger I. Abrams, a Major League
Baseball salary arbitrator and the dean of the Northeastern
University School of Law. ``They've never reached an agreement
without one. Sometimes, parties get hooked on that as the way they
conduct their relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   The players' union is expected to exercise its option to extend
the current collective bargaining agreement through the 2001
season. But soon, lawyers for both sides will begin what has been a
torturous dance, one that resulted in the unthinkable in 1994, a
work stoppage that resulted in the cancellation of the World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire, for one, is already on record that he will quit
before he participates in another work stoppage. Most reasoned
voices on both sides understand that it would be suicidal to shut
down the game yet again.
</P>
<P>
   Is it inevitable? Abrams, author of the new book, ``The Money
Pitch: Baseball Free Agency and Salary Arbitration,'' thinks not,
but cautions that while the owners and union have made some strides
in creating a better atmosphere of trust, there is much to be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope now that there will be more enlightened
leadership from Bud Selig, who is well respected by his
colleagues,'' Abrams said. ``But in the fairly near future, they
have to begin the process of dialogue before positions become
hardened. That's why I'm troubled that the union was not involved
in the preparation of this study.''
</P>
<P>
   The four-man group, appointed by the commissioner's office and
given access to the sport's financial data, did not come out in
favor of a salary cap, which is anathema to the union, nor did it
propose changes to rules governing free agency or salary
arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   The committee recommended a 50 percent luxury tax on payrolls
above $84 million; proposed sharing of 40 percent to 50 percent of
local revenues after ballpark expenses; and recommended that new
national broadcasting, licensing, and Internet revenue be
distributed unequally to assist low-revenue clubs, provided that
they meet a minimum payroll of $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not pretend to believe these changes will be easy or
universally popular,'' former Senate majority leader George
Mitchell, one of the panelists, said Friday. ``We do believe them
to be a solution to the alarming disparities between baseball's
haves and have-nots.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on the panel were former Federal Reserve Board chairman
Paul Volcker, Yale president Richard Levin, and political
commentator George Will.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an illustrious group,'' Abrams said. ``How can George
Will not be right? But George Mitchell may wish he was back in
Belfast before this is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell helped to broker a peace agreement in Northern Ireland
before this assignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The discussion seems to be in the correct direction,'' said
Abrams, who had not yet seen a copy of the full report. ``But one
would think they also would have to look at local TV revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows what kind of deal George (Steinbrenner) is going to
get in his new Yankees/Nets/Devils cable consortium? It could be
worth $100 million a year, then all bets are off.''
</P>
<P>
   Abrams noted how the Yankees recently crossed the $100 million
threshold for payrolls. ``That was a very significant event.
</P>
<P>
   ``What baseball needs is to develop confidence in one another as
partners,'' he said. ``There has to be a building of trust and
communication. The owners, the union, the players all have to
realize they are partners in an extraordinary enterprise, one that
is not really a big business but is very important to many of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The sides are not yet at that point, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't see it yet, I don't see it yet, but there are a lot
of people willing to help foster that dialogue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So what are his prospects?
</P>
<P>
   Dan Duquette smirked the other day when asked how close Japanese
righthander Tomo Ohka was to the Red Sox. ``About 45 miles,'' he
said. Without explaining why Ohka has been passed over while Paxton
Crawford was called up from Pawtucket to the big club, Duquette
said: ``Ohka's gotten the experience he has needed to get another
chance at the big leagues. He pitched well for us in September.''
Duquette was asked if there are prospects he absolutely would not
include in a deal. ``As you get closer and closer to the trading
deadline, you've got to make a decision where your ball club is. To
me, it doesn't make a lot of sense to give up young players you
could have for the next five or six years for a player you might
have for just a couple of months. But if you have a chance to make
the playoffs with one or two players, you have to consider all your
options.'' Brian Rose, who is back in Pawtucket and almost
certainly could benefit from a change of scenery, looms as a likely
player to be dealt before the deadline, especially if he strings
together some good starts for the PawSox. ``I like Brian Rose,''
said one major league scout. In the last five years, the pitcher
who dominated the International League more than any other was
Rose. Ohka and (Sunny) Kim are a lot like Rose, without the
pinpoint command. They're not going to succeed without that
control. Ohka and Kim to me are going to be long (relievers) or
fourth or fifth starters in the big leagues.'' . . . Duquette on
Tony Blanco, the 18-year-old third baseman from the Dominican
Republic off to a sensational start in the Gulf Coast League:
``Tony Blanco's got all the tools to be a big-time player.'' . . .
Sean Berry, the former Expo who signed a minor league deal with the
Sox and is currently with Pawtucket, said he'll leave if he doesn't
get a callup this week. Berry, who was released earlier this
season, said he was giving it 15 days . . . One major league
executive was caustic in his criticism of Reds GM Jim Bowden, who
last week traded his ace, Denny Neagle, to the Yankees for several
prospects. Bowden said the Reds were forced to make the move
because they couldn't risk letting Neagle go as a free agent after
the season, and was afraid the Reds couldn't afford the lefthander,
who is making $4.75 million. The Yankees already have begun
negotiations with Neagle, who figures to command a salary in the
Brad Radke range (four years, $36 million). Bowden is pleading cost
effectiveness after laying out a bundle to sign Ken Griffey in the
offseason. The Reds received some of the Yankees' top prospects in
return, including third baseman Drew Henson, pitcher Eddie Yarnall,
and outfielder Jackson Melian. ``I can't believe the trade is as
one-sided in Cincinnati's favor as it looks,'' the executive said.
``I have a pretty good feeling that the Yankees knew Henson (who
also plays quarterback for Michigan) isn't going to play baseball,
or isn't going to play just baseball. Yarnall, who had a chance to
be in the Yankees' rotation and didn't pitch well, has fallen out
of favor with a lot of people. Melian, the kid from Venezuela, is a
good player, but his parents were killed in a car accident a couple
of years ago and that has understandably affected him. They're
talented players, all three guys, but they all have some quirky
issues. And Bowden? He's got more bluster than anybody since P.T.
Barnum.'' . . . Talks are intensifying between Interbrew, owner of
the Toronto Blue Jays, and Rogers Communications, a cable network
power with plenty of dough. Toronto insiders are confident a deal
will be made, and if so, the Blue Jays are already contemplating
taking a run at free agent-to-be Chipper Jones, with current third
baseman Tony Batista moving to short if the Jays can land Chipper.
</P>

<P>
   Power plays have failed

   Both the Cubs and Sammy Sosa appear to be big losers in the
team's bid to trade him and the slugger's carping for a contract
extension when he still has a year left. ``I don't think Sammy is a
winning player, he's a sideshow,'' said one big-league official.
``The best thing the Yankees did in the last month was not making a
deal for either Sosa or Juan Gonzalez. The Yankees are not a New
York Post-type of team. They're totally businesslike,
go-about-their-work kind of guys who hang together and get the job
done. Gonzalez or Sosa might have ruined that. Sammy could have
been a Vladi Guerrero, but he stopped working on three-fifths of
his game. Good luck, him finding a team that will give him $17
million a year for four years.'' . . . Rumors abound in Cleveland
that the Indians might entertain offers for Manny Ramirez, who also
is eligible for free agency. The Indians freed up big money by
trading David Justice to the Yankees, and some clubs don't expect
the Indians to pick up the option they hold on Kenny Lofton for
next season, which would seem to give them even a bigger war chest
to re-sign Ramirez. But this will be a monster free agent market
this winter, and the Indians could decide to go in another
direction (Mike Mussina? Mike Hampton?) . . . Ben Mondor's PawSox
are treating the Aug. 1 exhibition between the US national team and
the Taiwan national team as more than just a baseball game. With GM
Lu Schwechheimer working closely with the Taiwanese consulate and
ambassador, the game is being transformed into a cultural festival,
much like what a fan might expect at an Olympic event. There are
60,000 native Taiwanese who live in the Greater Boston area,
Schwechheimer estimates, and there will be nearly an hourlong
pregame ceremony showcasing both Taiwanese and US cultures. The US
national team is not likely to be the same club that represents the
United States in the Olympics, since the selection committee will
be able to select professionals that are not on a team's 40-man
roster, but some players will make the cut. There are tickets
remaining for the 7:05 p.m. game ($10 box seats, $6 general
admission). One of the goals Mondor and his staff had when it
renovated McCoy Stadium was to attract world-class events, and this
is their first shot at one . . . Peter Gammons, who revolutionized
the coverage of baseball in the '70s and is widely known as ``The
Commissioner'' today, has been nominated for next year's Spink
Award by the Baseball Writers Association of America. Two other
worthies were nominated for the award, given annually at the Hall
of Fame induction ceremonies for career contributions to the game:
Ross Newhan, national baseball writer of the Los Angeles Times, and
Joe Falls, the longtime columnist for the Detroit News who had a
national audience for years in The Sporting News. The membership
will vote at the World Series. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He could be just a rental
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are willing to move righthander Darren Dreifort, but
he's eligible for free agency after the season . . . The Red Sox
are not on Curt Schilling's teams to which he would accept a trade,
according to published reports. His list reportedly includes the
Yankees, Braves, Mets, Diamondbacks, Cardinals, and Indians. He
apparently would also consider a trade to Toronto because of his
connection to Jim Fregosi, who was his manager when the Phillies
went to the World Series in 1993 . . . Despite the shocking
collapse of the Indians, there are no plans for the team to
jettison manager Charlie Manuel. The team's ridiculous run of
injuries _ it has gone through 26 pitchers _ makes it unfair to pin
anything on Manuel. His own bouts of bad health _ he has had two
surgeries on his colon, one in February and one in May, also robbed
him of a real chance to establish himself as a clubhouse presence.
But there is no question tensions are mounting on the Tribe. The
brothers Alomar, Sandy and Robbie, reportedly got in a shouting
match last Sunday after a game in which Robbie Alomar was hit by a
pitch and complained that Steve Karsay's retaliatory gesture _ he
hit Eddie Taubensee of the Reds with a pitch that just brushed his
jersey _ was insufficient . . . Al Martin, who made headlines this
spring when he was accused of being married to two women, could be
had in a trade with the Padres, but that has little to do with his
domestic difficulties, more to do with his inability to hit lefties
(5 for 60, .083 at the break) . . . Duquette will be competing with
Pat Gillick of the Mariners in his efforts to obtain another
hitter. Names still floating around include Ron Gant, Rondell White
(he just went on the DL), John Jaha (so did he), Bobby Higginson,
and Jeromy Burnitz. Pitchers that will draw interest before the
trading deadline include Esteban Loiaza (Rangers), Ismael Valdes
(Cubs), Hideo Nomo (Tigers), and Scott Erickson (Orioles) . . . Tim
Raines plans to play four games for independent Somerset in the
Atlantic League to prepare for a tryout with the US Olympic team.
Raines, 41, retired in March after 21 seasons in the majors, in
part because of his ongoing battle with lupus . . . Amin Fatah, the
Red Sox press parking attendant and unofficial president of the
Somalia branch of the Sox fan club, is adamant the Sox will win the
AL East. Sports Illustrated, interestingly, hasn't backed off its
preseason prediction the Sox will win it all. Wrote SI's Tom
Verducci in this week's issue: ``Neither (James) Baldwin, bless his
anonymous mug, nor anyone else is about to outduel the great
Martinez in October.''

AN EVERETT BLOWOUT IN SOX WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The autumn winds have yet to howl. But that October feeling fell
on Fenway Park Saturday as the Red Sox and New York Mets ended a
raucous weekend series in a swirl of conflict, intrigue, and
intensity worthy of a fall classic.
</P>
<P>
   There was Hurricane Carl Everett turning tornadic, head-bumping
plate umpire Ronald Kulpa and getting tossed, most likely to await
a hefty suspension. There was manager Jimy Williams accusing the
Mets of conspiring to incite Everett's eruption. And there were
enough off-field charges and countercharges to fill a docket on
``The Practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there was a baseball game that turned on a dramatic
three-run home run by an accidental hero, Brian Daubach, who came
off the Boston bench for Everett after his second-inning ejection.
</P>
<P>
   With their 6-4 victory, the Red Sox clinched a 2-1 advantage in
the weekend showdown, winning their first series at home in eight
tries since May 10. And though the outcome was more joyous for Sox
fans than the disastrous 1986 World Series with the Mets, the
experience put the participants in an October state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like playoff baseball the last three days,'' said
Daubach, whose two-out, two-strike double in the bottom of the
ninth Thursday won the series opener. ``It was two good teams, two
intense teams, and three good ballgames. I think if we get to play
them in October, it would be a heck of a dogfight.''
</P>
<P>
   By then, barring other complications, Everett might be back in
the lineup. But first the Sox slugger faces a penalty that could
equal the five-day suspension that Atlanta manager Bobby Cox
recently drew for bumping an umpire.
</P>
<P>
   In an outburst that may represent the worst on-field behavior by
a Sox player since Roger Clemens was ejected from a 1990 playoff
game in Oakland, Everett exploded after Kulpa twice warned him he
was violating the boundaries of the batter's box by straddling the
line closest to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Everett, with his rear foot across the chalk line, stands as
close to the plate as almost any batter in the big leagues. Mets
reliever Dennis Cook had complained the night before, after hitting
Everett in the left shoulder, that Everett was out of the batter's
box.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Everett protested when Kulpa informed him after the
first pitch from Mets ace Mike Hampton that he was standing too
close. Yet Everett maintained his composure and waved Williams back
to the dugout when the manager headed for the scene.
</P>
<P>
   However, Kulpa had drawn a line in the dirt to indicate how
close Everett could approach the plate. And Everett had erased the
line to Kulpa's consternation.
</P>
<P>
   Four pitches later, with the count 2-2, Kulpa again warned
Everett and drew another line, sending the hitter into a frenzy.
Everett apparently said something unacceptable to Kulpa, who
ejected him. The two then went toe to toe, jawing, and Everett
appeared to make contact twice with Kulpa. First, the bill of
Everett's batting helmet appeared to strike Kulpa's face. Then
Everett banged his head into the umpire's nose, forcing Kulpa to
backpedal in apparent pain.
</P>
<P>
   For minutes, Everett stormed about the field. Before he
disappeared into the runway to the clubhouse, several Sox players
and coaches tried to restrain or calm him, all to little or no
avail. First base coach Tommy Harper first stood between Everett
and the umpire. Third base coach Wendell Kim joined Harper. And
Williams was always a few steps away.
</P>
<P>
   Still, reinforcements were needed. Jose Offerman rushed out of
the dugout. Then Mets right fielder Derek Bell, Everett's boyhood
friend from Tampa and former teammate in Houston, ran in to try to
calm Everett. But Bell was intercepted by Mets manager Bobby
Valentine and could only watch as the Sox tried to shepherd Everett
off the field.
</P>
<P>
   In his last angry acts before departing, Everett hurled a bat
from the dugout onto the field, knocked over a water cooler, and
exchanged words with at least one teammate, Bret Saberhagen.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Everett's other teammates kept their distance during the
episode. And many declined to discuss specifics afterward. ``It's
out of the control of my hands,'' said catcher Jason Varitek.
</P>
<P>
   Everett would not discuss the episode after the game. ``No man,
I'm not talking,'' he said as he left the clubhouse with his baby
in his arms to attend postgame Family Day activities on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Nor were the umpires talking.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams was. And he was livid at the Mets, whom he accused
of precipitating the furor by complaining to the umpires before the
game. ``That was set up before the game ever started,'' he said.
``It had to be the opposing team calling the umpires. That's the
only way it could happen. I know it came from the other side.
There's no doubt in my mind. I don't even have to ask anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams suggested the Mets may have dropped a dime on Everett
``in retaliation'' for the Sox manager twice asking the umpires
Friday night to check if Cook was doctoring the ball. That had sent
Cook into a similar rage. He was ejected for hitting Everett and
complained he should not be penalized because Everett was crowding
the plate and beyond the batter's box.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets controlled the game early. Sox starter Ramon Martinez
faltered in the first inning, yielding two-out walks to Edgardo
Alfonzo and Mike Piazza. Todd Zeile then exploited Martinez's
wildness by doubling to the right-field gap, scoring both runners.
</P>
<P>
   But Martinez (7-5) regained his control and put himself in
position to end a personal three-game winless streak. Before Rheal
Cormier relieved him in the seventh, Martinez walked no more Mets
and struck out three.
</P>
<P>
   He dodged potential trouble in the third after Alfonzo doubled
by striking out Piazza to end the inning. And after Piazza doubled
in the sixth, Martinez stranded him at third by inducing Zeile to
ground out and Matt Franco to hit an inning-ending fly ball to Troy
O'Leary in left.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hampton (9-6) stifled the Sox on one hit, a
first-inning double by Jeff Frye, through the first four innings.
Hampton, who entered with a 7-1 record and 1.87 ERA in his previous
12 starts, kept 11 straight Sox off the bases after Frye's hit,
then began his undoing by plunking Daubach to lead off the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   A batter later, Izzy Alcantara singled to center. Manny
Alexander singled home Daubach, Darren Lewis followed with a ground
ball to third that Matt Franco fired into the Sox dugout, allowing
Alcantara to score.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sox struck Hampton's death blow in the sixth. Frye
singled to open the inning. After Varitek grounded out, Hampton
intentionally walked Nomar Garciaparra, who ended his brief
flirtation with the .400 mark by going hitless in three at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   The logic was sound. Walk the major leagues' leading hitter so
Hampton, a lefty, could face the lefthanded Daubach, a former Met.
But Daubach, who relishes every measure of revenge he can exact
against his ex-team, had extra incentive, after his former friend,
Mets catcher Todd Pratt, was quoted in a New York paper as
denigrating Daubach as a ``scab'' for serving as a replacement
player for the Mets during spring training in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Daubach, who declined after the game to discuss Pratt's
comments, offered his rebuttal on Hampton's first pitch, lifting it
into the screen above the left-field scoreboard. ``I thought it was
going to be off the wall,'' Daubach said, ``but luckily it
carried.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Red Sox won the series, though they may have
lost Everett. Yet Williams considered the series one to remember,
maybe even in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was some rivalry for three games,'' he said.

LOSS OF CONTROL CROSSED THE LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jimy Williams is right. Carl Everett was set up Saturday by the
New York Mets, just as Williams set up Dennis Cook the night
before.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets almost certainly called the umpires' attention to
Everett standing too close to the plate, even though he has set up
in the same spot all season, just as Williams the night before had
the umpires checking Mets reliever Dennis Cook to see whether he
was defacing the ball with his thumbnail.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Friday), we got in someone's head,'' Sox pitcher Rod Beck
said. ``Today, (the Mets) got in someone's head. Except it's going
to cost our guy a few games.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook was ejected from Friday night's game, but that was the end
of it. Everett was ejected Saturday, but that will only be the
beginning. Everett, who made contact with plate umpire Ronald Kulpa
twice, the second time head-butting him with such force that the
rookie ump's head snapped back, will pay for his rage with a
suspension that will be a minimum of five games, and could possibly
be double that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be five a bump,'' Beck said. ``He got him with the
beak of the helmet, and then he head-butted the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   This much is certain: No Sox player in uniform has snapped like
this since Roger Clemens, dressed for combat in eye black and Ninja
turtle shoelaces, was ejected from Game 4 of the 1990 American
League playoffs in Oakland by Terry Cooney. Clemens, who charged
from the mound and pushed aside umpire Jim Evans in his attempt to
get at Cooney, served a five-game suspension at the start of the
following season and was fined $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   This, too, is certain: Everett, whose meltdown occurred in the
hours between a morning pickup game involving Sox players and their
kids and a postgame team barbecue attended by CEO John Harrington,
crossed a line, as surely as he violated the line drawn in the
batter's box by Kulpa.
</P>
<P>
   His loss of control was so complete that his boyhood friend from
Tampa, Mets outfielder Derek Bell, ran in from right field to try
and calm him down, an extraordinary act by an opposition player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known him since I was a kid and (was) trying to make sure
he didn't get into serious, serious, serious trouble,'' Bell told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Had Bell seen him this angry before? ``Yeah, I grew up with
him,'' he said. ``I've seen him since he was 8 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox pitcher Pedro Martinez, among others, urged reporters
not to focus on Everett's actions. ``Don't make a big deal about
it, guys,'' Martinez said after the game, clapping his hands.
``Come on, guys, pick us up. Write about the game. Let's go.''
</P>
<P>
   But like it or not, by his actions, which were beamed across the
country by Fox, Everett has resurrected his history of explosive
behavior. It's not by accident that Bell was worried Everett might
go too far.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, while playing for the Florida Marlins' Triple A team in
Edmonton, Everett was suspended for a dugout confrontation with
manager Sal Rende, in which he shouted expletives at Rende and had
to be restrained by three coaches. He was suspended for the team's
final trip of the season and that winter was traded by the Marlins
to the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, according to a Marlins uniformed official,
Everett was involved in another ugly incident on a commercial
flight carrying the team. Everett became upset because someone had
placed a briefcase on his clothing, the official said, and began
cursing passengers loudly. A coach had to intervene on that
occasion, too.
</P>
<P>
   Did his behavior have anything to do with his subsequent trade.
``Yeah,'' the Marlins official said. ``He just couldn't handle a
lot of situations, both on and off the field. He was so
inconsistent, in both his play and his behavior. You didn't know
from one day to the next what you're going to get out of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he's played lights out the last couple of years in
Houston, so I thought maybe he has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins official was asked whether people were concerned by
the intensity of Everett's rage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has that aura about him,'' the official said. ``You're not
sure what's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Everett was banned from winter ball for an incident in
Venezuela in which he had a run-in with an umpire, then went into
the stands after fans he claimed threw beer at him.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, while playing for the Mets, Everett was ejected from a
game against the Marlins in Miami after making an obscene gesture
at plate umpire Larry Poncino. Poncino, one of the umpires who lost
his job in last summer's labor dispute, said that he and Everett
had exchanged words after Everett gestured about a strike call that
Poncino had made in a previous at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `This is the big leagues, and we don't do that
BS,' '' Poncino said.
</P>
<P>
   Everett responded by stepping out of the box, Poncino told him
to step back in, but after Everett popped up, more trouble ensued.
</P>
<P>
   ``As he's running across the field, he flips me the bird,''
Poncino said from his home in Tucson. ``I said, `Keep on going.' He
made a beeline at me, how he didn't bump me, I don't know. He
threatened to kick my ass, and he threw Bobby Valentine (the Mets'
manager) to the ground. The guy went totally nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Poncino said he recalled Everett being suspended two games and
fined after that incident.
</P>
<P>
   Everett had not had an incident since coming to Boston until two
weeks ago in Chicago, when he exploded at Globe columnist Dan
Shaughnessy, hurling curses at both the newspaperman and team
publicist Glenn Wilburn before coach Tommy Harper pulled him into
the trainer's room. Everett was upset, he said, because he thought
Shaughnessy had written that Everett and second baseman Jeff Frye
had been fighting. Shaughnessy merely had written the two had had
an animated conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Saturday. ``This is embarrassing, uncalled for,'' Fox
broadcaster Joe Buck told the nation as Sox coaches Tommy Harper
and Wendell Kim, along with teammate Jose Offerman, fought to
contain Everett. ``He is right now out of control. One hundred
percent out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Jimy Williams was asked if he was worried about
Everett's temper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he should be.

NO DISPUTE IN LEWIS WIN OVER BOTHA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Boxing's White Buffalo became extinct Saturday night,
and it didn't take long for Lennox Lewis to wipe out the herd.
</P>
<P>
   With the first overhand right the undisputed heavyweight
champion landed, he buckled the knees of Frans Botha, the
self-styled White Buffalo of South Africa. Although Botha did not
drop, he reeled backward from mid-ring to the ropes like a man hit
by a stun gun.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not wanting to disappoint the estimated crowd of 9,500
who had gathered at London Arena, Lewis approached cautiously and
took heed to do no more damage for the moment.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a long moment.
</P>
<P>
   By midway through the next round, Botha was often leaning
backward and seldom punching until Lewis suddenly dropped a
chopping right hand to the ear that buckled Botha's knees again. A
short left came right behind it into the middle of Botha's face.
Already headed floorward, Botha did not hit his knees soon enough
as the champion leaped forward and slammed one final, long right
hand to the face that swept Botha out of the ring facefirst.
</P>
<P>
   Referee Larry O'Connell, who had been so vilified in England for
calling the first Lewis-Evander Holyfield fight a draw, needed no
help with his vision this time. On his hands and knees with his
face hanging outside the ring and facing a roaring crowd he could
neither hear nor see, Botha's helplessness was obvious and
O'Connell waved his hands immediately after Botha tottered to his
feet at the count of 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lennox caught me with a great shot like a champion and what
can you do,'' Botha asked no one in particular.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis had come home to fight in London for the first time in six
years (and probably for the last time) for just this purpose _ to
destroy his opponent and continue claiming his place as the world's
best heavyweight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept Botha in a zone where he was totally ineffective,''
said Emanuel Steward, Lewis's often hard-to-please trainer. ``He
kept him where Lennox could fight and Botha couldn't. I couldn't
believe he could land three hard blows like that so fast and knock
him out of the ring like (he was) an 80-pound man.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory upped Lewis's record to 36-1-1 with 29 KOs and left
him well-rested for a scheduled November fight with International
Boxing Federation No. 1 contender David Tua, who is a far more
powerful puncher than Botha (40-3-1) but an even smaller man.
</P>
<P>
   But Lewis had more than his destruction of Botha on his mind to
send back to the man in America he really wants to fight. He also
had a postfight message: ``Tell Mike Tyson, either put up or shut
up,'' Lewis said. ``He's fighting guys like Lou Savarese and
talking about being the best since (Jack) Dempsey and all that
rubbish. He gave up his championship a long time ago. He's not even
the best in his era. Evander Holyfield beat him twice. I'm the
undisputed heavyweight champion. I'm the man at the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed so, but business must go on. And with Tyson an unwilling
and unlikely future victim for Lewis, earlier in the evening
another potential slaughter victim named Wladimir Klitschko was put
on display. For seven rounds, the heavily hyped heavyweight from
the Ukraine bombed a kid from Queens named Monte Barrett with
looping right hooks and solid left hands, driving him to the floor
five times before referee Richie Davies came to the conclusion that
enough was enough. By the time he did, at 2:42 of the seventh
round, enough had been more than enough for Barrett.
</P>
<P>
   By then Klitschko had beaten the stuffing out of him, badly
cutting his right eye and dropping him three times in the seventh
round before Davies stepped in and stopped the fight. That came
long after Barrett's initial trip to the floor, late in the first
round when Klitschko dropped him with a sneak attack of a hook off
the break.
</P>
<P>
   That punch left so lasting an impression on Barrett that he
spent an inordinate amount of time the rest of the night clutching
the towering Ukrainian to his chest. Fred Astaire spent less time
cheek to cheek with Ginger Rogers than Barrett did with Klitschko,
yet the strategy did little toward bringing him a victory.
</P>
<P>
   Klitschko's long jab landed repeatedly. When he found his
distance, he hurt Barrett (23-2) either with short right hooks or
stinging lefts that convinced his opponent to pursue his strategy
of clutching him until Klitschko finally rid himself with a thud in
the seventh round. First a right-left combination dropped the
tiring Barrett midway through the round and split open the side of
his eye. When he got up, blood was trickling down his face. But
before it had time to reach his chin, Klitschko dropped him again
with another right hand.
</P>
<P>
   Klitschko was ordered back to work after Barrett got up again.
So, again, he summarily clubbed him to the floor a third time with
one more thudding right to the face. As Barrett fell, even Davies
could no longer ignore the carnage and called a halt to the affair.
</P>
<P>
   But Klitschko (34-1, 32 KO's) and HBO both got what they wanted,
since each was hoping for the kind of knockout that would allow
them to continue building him into a future opponent for the man
who would soon follow him into the ring and leave even sooner.

COUTTS VISIT FLOATS THEIR BOAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Russell Coutts, the 37-year-old New Zealander who twice
skippered his country to America's Cup wins, will appear at the
Pleon Yacht Club in Marblehead Tuesday night to talk with sailors
in the youth program.
</P>
<P>
   Pleon, the 113-year-old club once hailed as ``the parent of the
junior yachting movement,'' admits all sailors for membership up to
the age of 20. The club is run and staffed entirely by teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   Coutts, one of the most decorated sailors in the world, has been
competing in various regattas in the United States and eagerly
agreed to speak with the young sailors.
</P>
<P>
   Last February, Coutts skippered Team New Zealand to its second
consecutive America's Cup win, in Auckland, and in 1995 he led TNZ
to become the second non-American team to win the Cup. Australia
took the oldest trophy in sports away from the New York Yacht Club
in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   That year, Coutts was preparing for the 1984 Los Angeles
Olympics, in which he won the gold medal in Finn (singlehanded)
Class. A decade later, after amassing an impressive streak of wins
on various boats, he became two-time champion of the World
Match-Racing Circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Coutts took over as skipper of TNZ after the Kiwis placed second
behind Italy in the 1992 America's Cup Challenger trials, and in
the 1995 Cup races in San Diego, he skippered his team to an
overwhelming win with a 37-1 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such an honor for us to have a sailor the caliber of
Coutts to address the program,'' said Bob Campbell, a Pleon alumnus
and veteran America's Cup racer. ``The kids are all excited about
meeting him and hearing what he has to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, to young sailors, Coutts is Michael Jordan or Pete
Sampras. The year before Coutts successfully defended the Cup in
Auckland, he became the Etchells Class world champion.
</P>
<P>
   But to many, Coutts may well be remembered for a simple but huge
gesture on the eve of New Zealand's America's Cup triumph last
February. Having won four straight races with laughable ease over
Italy's Prada, TNZ had just one race to win for a sweep. About the
only question remaining was whether Coutts would stay at the helm
or turn it over to 22-year-old understudy Dean Barker.
</P>
<P>
   Including 1995, Coutts had won nine straight America's Cup races
and a 10th would have set a Cup record.
</P>
<P>
   But on the morning of the race, Coutts offered the helm to
Barker, who leaped at the chance and, swallowing his nervousness,
gave Prada the same sort of thumping Coutts had.
</P>
<P>
   During the final series, Coutts spoke of his approach to racing.
Sometimes described as ``spaced out'' by his crew, Coutts says he
merely focuses and visualizes several moves ahead in a race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes people think I'm deaf,'' Coutts said, ``but it's
just that I get so focused on what I'm doing I tune out a lot of
other things that might be distractions. I like to do a lot of
thinking, visualizing.''
</P>
<P>
   At Pleon, Coutts will be speaking to a bastion of sailing
history that sparkles with the names of such world-class performers
as Ted Hood, George O'Day, Dave Curtis, Robbie Doyle, J.B. Braun,
Jud Smith, Geoff Mason, and Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   Legend has it the Pleon Club took shape on a summer afternoon in
1887, when Arthur Wood and a friend were looking out at the sea,
watching sailboat races, a game played mostly by adults.
</P>
<P>
   Wood then founded Pleon for junior sailors and over the next 40
years nurtured it into the independent club it is. Two former Pleon
sailors, Hood, who skippered Courageous to an America's Cup victory
in 1974, and the late O'Day, an Olympic gold medalist who designed
some of the best one-design classes in the world, wrote about their
feelings for the club.
</P>
<P>
   Said Hood, the famous boat builder and sailmaker who still races
out of the New York Yacht Club in Newport, R.I.: ``Pleon is a
unique institution. It provides something for everyone, no matter
what their ability . . . from recreational sailing to advanced
(race) tactics and club management.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Day, whose designs included Rhodes 19, Widgeon, Javelin, and
the O'Day Daysailor, said of the club: ``Pleon is where it all
started. From its programs have come the sailors who have won the
America's Cup, Olympic and Pan American Games, and every major US
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pleon gave me more than racing skills; it gave me a life and
love of creating and building boats.''
</P>
<P>
   Coutts's appearance at Pleon befits a theme he often has spoken
about. ``Kids have to have an early love for the sport if they're
going to do it,'' says Coutts, who will sail for a Swiss Cup
syndicate in 2003. ``Adults have to know when to help them and when
to get out of the way and let their love for sailing take its own
course.''

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-to,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the nonfiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)
</P>
<P>
   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending July 8 at
almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other
retailers, statistically weighted to represent sales in all such
outlets nationwide. The number of titles within the two
subdivisions of nonfiction can change from week to week, reflecting
changes in book buying.

<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're looking for a quick resolution regarding the Bruins'
large crop of restricted (Group 2) free agents, don't hold your
breath. There's a good chance several, if not most, of the club's
unsigned players will still be without contracts as training camp
draws near.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it was obvious the tide around the league had turned
significantly, with teams taking a much tougher stance financially
than in the past. It took longer for restricted free agents to come
to terms and involved much more haggling.
</P>
<P>
   Right wing Anson Carter acknowledges he has a much different
view of his worth than the Bruins, which will likely lead to a
standoff and perhaps a trade. Carter decided against filing for
arbitration, setting the stage for a holdout. That same stance a
year ago proved disastrous for goalie Byron Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins say they're in it for the long haul and management
doesn't expect an easy August.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a waiting game for both sides,'' said
president/general manager Harry Sinden. ``There have been hardly
any Group 2 free agents signed. Everyone is much more cautious.
Almost every team has gone way beyond their budgets and their
owners are saying, `Stop it,' so they're a little more cautious and
they're not jumping into the fray.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden said whether a player elects to take the team to
arbitration doesn't alter the Bruins' view of his worth. He said
the philosophy the team uses for formulating its offers is based on
what it projects the player would be awarded in arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one time, I took a much firmer line,'' said Sinden. ``I'd
say, `I don't care where you should be, this is what you're
getting.' But (the media) beat me up so much on that. From a
(public relations) standpoint and from a player's perspective, you
have to go in with the numbers that come up, just as if an
arbitrator was deciding it. The only difference, of course, is that
an arbitrator isn't deciding it and what you may see is the number
the arbitrator would give. (The players) don't always see it that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations with center Joe Thornton won't be easy, but
it's Carter who stands to be the most difficult, even more
difficult than the contract impasse in 1998 that resulted in
Carter's holdout until November. Even Sinden acknowledged that
Carter would be the toughest to re-sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea here is to not get him cheap and I would hope they
wouldn't want to take advantage of the situation and get
overpaid,'' said Sinden. ``That's really what it's all about. We
tried to do it now by bringing up the (players of comparable
ability) just like the arbitrator would and saying, `This is where
he fits.' We can usually show the agent and the player. They have
access to the same data we do.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes the situation murkier is that Carter was limited to
59 games last season because of injury. Complicating it further is
the Bruins' dismal performance, which resulted in them missing the
playoffs for the second time in four years. Sinden said he doesn't
expect any of his free agents to concede leverage despite the
club's misfortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was always a huge factor in contract negotiations, what
kind of a year the team had,'' said Sinden. ``If you were on a
losing team, you never had a chance. They don't seem to figure
that's a factor anymore. They never figure they had anything to do
with the team losing. I'm not saying I'd be different. I'd say, `We
were terrible except for me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Buying some time
</P>
<P>
   Say what you will about the Paul Coffey signing, but at the very
least it provides the Bruins a necessary buffer zone that will
allow defensemen such as Jonathan Girard and Nick Boynton more time
to develop.
</P>
<P>
   ``That played a big part in it,'' said Sinden. ``Following the
draft we had three defensemen that we knew could play for us.
That's all. We had three possibles and probables in Girard,
Boynton, and Brandon Smith. Since then, we have six who can play
for us definitely and we have another five, including Girard,
Boynton, and Smith, who are possible and probable. We've got some
depth now on our defense and we do think we have enough people to
fill out our roster on the NHL level.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cup's schedule is full
</P>
<P>
   Rookie of the year Scott Gomez of the Devils, who was one of the
best feel-good stories of last season, took the Stanley Cup home to
his native Alaska last week. Gomez, the first Latino to play in the
NHL, had big plans, including having the Cup mushed by dogsled,
raised 200 feet by an Anchorage Fire Department ladder, and taking
it to a children's hospital ward . . . For awhile, it appeared Rob
Ray had played his last game for the Buffalo Sabres after the club
declined to pick up an $800,000 option on his contract. However,
for a reduced rate, the Sabres decided to re-sign Ray, who ranks
11th on the league's all-time penalty minutes list. Initially, Ray
was upset the team didn't pick up the option but he cooled down as
the sides continued talking. Ray played only slightly more than
four minutes per game last year . . . Forward Dany Heatley, the No.
2 overall choice by the Atlanta Thrashers in last month's draft,
has decided to stay at the University of Wisconsin. Heatley, who
was the rookie of the year in the WCHA last season, paid his own
way to visit the Thrashers and tour their facilities . . . The last
time Dave Andreychuk played for the Sabres, Lindy Ruff was his
teammate. Now, Andreychuk, who just re-signed with Buffalo, has
Ruff as his coach . . . Former Bruin Marc Potvin has been named the
head coach of the Springfield Falcons, the American Hockey League
affiliate of the Phoenix Coyotes. The 33-year-old Potvin, who
played 33 regular-season games for the Bruins from 1994-96, last
year served as head coach and director of hockey operations for the
Mississippi Sea Wolves of the East Coast League . . . Steve
Staios's stay in New Jersey wasn't long. The former Bruin was
acquired by the Devils June 12 for a ninth-round draft pick. Last
week, he was sent back to the Thrashers for future draft picks.
Staios, who plays defense and forward, was hampered by injuries
last year and limited to 27 games.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Really, how do you feel?
</P>
<P>
   When one reporter asked Sinden if he had any interest in signing
free agent Vladimir Malakhov, who last week wound up with the
Rangers, Sinden minced no words. ``No,'' he said. ``Very little.''
Malakhov, remember, was the player who was out of the Montreal
Canadiens' lineup because of a knee injury but was well enough to
ski with his family. The Habs traded him to New Jersey, where he
went on to play well and win the Stanley Cup . . . In case you
missed it, the Coyotes signed Bruins right wing Landon Wilson to a
one-year deal plus an option. They're hoping he can do what he
couldn't in Boston _ stick in the NHL. ``I think Landon has a real
good opportunity to be a good NHL player,'' said Coyotes GM Bobby
Smith. ``He has played very well at times but it just wasn't
working out for him in Boston and it was time for a change of
scenery for him.'' . . . 53 days to training camp.

<P>
   &UR; BONE BY BONE &LR;  By Peter Matthiessen. (Vintage International,
$14.) The last of three novels about the life and times of Edgar J.
Watson _ cane planter, entrepreneur and mass murderer _ recounts
his conquest of Florida's Gulf Coast, an obsession with echoes in
the imperialistic impulses of a growing America. ``This is a work
of genuine dignity,'' Sven Birkerts wrote in The New York Times
Book Review in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE CLONE AGE: Adventures in the New World of Reproductive
Technology &LR;  By Lori B. Andrews (Owl/Holt, $15.) A lawyer traces her
career as an expert in the legal and moral aspects of assisted
reproduction from the birth of the first test-tube baby in 1978 to
the threshold of the clone age. ``Hers is a fine and readable
book,'' John R.G. Turner wrote last year. ``She has a wonderful dry
sense of humor.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TURN OF THE CENTURY &LR;  By Kurt Andersen. (Delta, $14.95.) This
sprawling comedy of millennial manners revolves around a nomadic
power couple _ a hypersuccessful Silicon Alley CEO and a struggling
television producer _ at play in the infotainment economy of New
York. Andersen ``wins back terrain for the novel that has been
ceded to new media, demonstrating that the novel is as alive and as
nimble as its high-tech competitors,'' Po Bronson wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A CLEARING IN THE DISTANCE: Frederick Law Olmsted and America
in the 19th Century &LR;  By Witold Rybczynski. (Touchstone/Simon &AMP;
Schuster, $15.) The suburban visionary who designed New York's
Central Park and other monuments of green is portrayed as a humble
man with little formal training who believed in the restorative
power of landscape for ordinary citizens. Last year the reviewer
Suzannah Lessard called this an ``excellent biography'' that is
``thorough and respectful, yet easeful in a way that is reminiscent
of Olmsted himself.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TOUGH, TOUGH TOYS FOR TOUGH, TOUGH BOYS &LR;  By Will Self. (Grove,
$12.) The killing of a fly imagined as blood sport. A Londoner who
finds a giant rock of crack cocaine under his house. These
outlandish stories both amuse and horrify as they render everyday
reality plastic and absurd. Last year the reviewer Jonathan Lethem
admired Self's ``vibrantly caustic prose and his anarchic and
florid satirical premises.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BYRON: Child of Passion, Fool of Fame &LR;  By Benita Eisler.
(Vintage, $18.) According to this biography, the poet was both an
arrogant English patrician and a prodigious libertine whose
devotion to sexual freedom got him into a world of trouble. ``The
seesawing moods and volatile allegiances of Byron ... are reported
with sensitive understanding,'' Claude Rawson said in 1999. The
book ``astutely identifies links between Byron's defiance of
prevailing moral codes and his political radicalism.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE REAL WILD WEST: The 101 Ranch and the Creation of the
American West &LR;  By Michael Wallis. (St. Martin's Griffin, $21.95.)
The 101 Ranch, a vast private spread founded after the Civil War
that once covered nearly 110,000 acres in northeastern Oklahoma,
helped to shape popular perceptions of the American frontier for
many years. Wallis ``is the first writer to tie together the 101
Ranch's many stories,'' Allen Barra wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE EARTH SHALL WEEP: A History of Native America &LR;  By James
Wilson (Grove, $16) is not so much a survey of Indian cultures as
it is a study of the calamitous impact of white conquest on
indigenous societies and a dissection of the many myths generated
by the conquerors. Last year the reviewer Richard E. Nicholls
called this a ``carefully researched and wide-ranging narrative.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MEMENTO MORI &LR;  By Muriel Spark. (New Directions, $11.95.) In
this mystery set in 1950s London, a group of elderly friends (with
more than a few skeletons in their closets) is tormented by an
anonymous telephone caller who informs each of them, ``Remember you
must die.'' ``Spark's trim, unloitering narrative reveals a fairly
complete gamut of human seaminess,'' Robert Phelps wrote in The New
York Times Book Review in 1959. The result is ``a daffily hilarious
book, even though it is pervasively concerned with the importance
of Death and Judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; RUN CATCH KISS &LR;  By Amy Sohn. (Scribner, $12.) Ariel Steiner,
the precocious young heroine of this first novel, is a sex
columnist for a New York newspaper who kicks up a citywide scandal
when it's discovered she's been making up colorful material for her
column. ``It's hard not to be entertained by the hapless but
indomitable Ariel'' and her misadventures, Matthew Flamm wrote in
1999.

CASTIGLIONE HAS NO AIRS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's time someone finally said it: Joe Castiglione is the latest
in a distinguished line of broadcasters to be the official ``Voice
of the Boston Red Sox.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Aw, not really,'' comes the predictable protest from a modest
man. ``It's different today, with the proliferation of media.
There's NESN, there's over-the-air TV, and there's radio. It's not
like the old days. To call one person that would be misleading.''
</P>
<P>
   Good try, Joe, but it doesn't wash. With all due respect to Sean
McDonough, Bob Kurtz, Jerry Remy, and your partner, Jerry Trupiano,
the No. 1 radio man will always be the person most associated with
a team's broadcast image. Radio is the baseball broadcast medium.
It is radio that accompanies you on the front porch, in the
kitchen, in the backyard, on the beach, and, most importantly, in
the car. Historically, radio calls resonate far more than TV calls
do. The No. 1 radio voice is, for better or worse, the essential
link between any major league baseball team and its fans, and in
this town that voice belongs to Joe Castiglione.
</P>
<P>
   OK, the voice. It's not a classic doomsday broadcaster voice; we
can all agree on that. It's a voice ripe for parody. It's not Ned
Martin's voice, or Ken Coleman's voice, or Bob Wilson's voice, or
even Trupiano's enviable voice. It is comparatively thin and reedy
and nasally, and when Castiglione goes into the high register to
describe a great play every dog in Berkshire County springs to
attention. So nobody's perfect, all right?
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly don't have Mel Allen's pipes,'' he acknowledges,
citing a boyhood hero. ``But I think it's a voice that wears well.
It's not big and booming, but there is wearability. I think over
180 games, counting exhibitions and, perhaps, postseason play,
people need to look at you as a friend who calls the ballgame, not
as a commercial announcer.''
</P>
<P>
   He has no signature home run call. ``Bob Starr said it best,''
laughs Castiglione. ``All the good ones are taken.'' He doesn't
quote Tennyson, a la Ned Martin. He doesn't invent imaginary
catchers of foul balls, the way Ernie Harwell does. He doesn't do
the overtly ``We'' thing, either, although he has always cared
deeply (The ever-wry Starr once observed in the wake of a
game-winning homer by New York's Mel Hall that ``My partner looks
as if he's just been harpooned'').
</P>
<P>
   What Joe Castiglione does is tell you what happened, and I mean
precisely what happened. My longtime colleague Jack Craig once
pointed out something to the effect that if a ground ball had three
hops, Joe Castig will tell you it had three, not two or four. I
like that. After all, isn't using words to paint a clear picture of
the game what radio play-by-play broadcasting is all about?
</P>
<P>
   The second big thing Joe Castig brings to a broadcast is vast
empirical knowledge. He seems to know everything worth knowing
about the career of every player who steps up to the plate or takes
the mound. And he knows how to dole out the information without
being either smug or repetitive. ``I've always been blessed with
good recall,'' he says. ``But I do have a system. I start a file
card on every player the first time around. I still do them all in
longhand because it helps the recall process.''
</P>
<P>
   He buttresses this system with the expected pregame schmoozing
around the batting cage and in the dining room with fellow
broadcasters and scouts who, as all baseball media people know, are
the greatest sources imaginable. If there is a new tidbit to be
unearthed, be assured that Red Sox radio listeners will immediately
be apprised.
</P>
<P>
   If life is good for Joe Castiglione, now in his 18th year as a
Red Sox broadcaster and seventh as the No. 1 man (even though he
rejects the title as overly pretentious), it's because it's well
deserved. His dues were paid in duplicate.
</P>
<P>
   How about coming here in 1983 from Cleveland, taking a pay cut,
and then spending the entire season living at the Susse Chalet in
Newton while his family was back home because the Castigliones were
unable to sell their house? ``Twenty-six dollars a night,'' he
recalls. ``But the worst part was packing my trunk and taking it to
the basement each time we went on a road trip so I wouldn't be
charged for the room while I was away.'' Christian charity
precludes him being asked what he made that season, but the rumor
is that he would have been better off going on welfare and donating
his services to the radio station.
</P>
<P>
   The early critics were pretty vicious. He was crucified over the
voice thing, of course, and when they weren't going after him for
his sound they were attacking him for just about every thought that
popped out of his head. It didn't help any that he was replacing
Jon Miller, who while thoroughly unappreciated by management, was
the darling of the critics. ``I got ripped a lot that first year,''
Castiglione says, ``and it hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   What got him through it all was the support he received from
Coleman and Johnny Pesky, who was recuperating from a mysterious
allergy attack that year and who spent a lot of time in the
broadcast booth. The booth has always been a refuge for him, from
that time to the present. ``From Kenny to Bob Starr to Trup, I've
never had a cross word up there,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The late Bob Starr was an intriguing mentor. ``I learned a lot
from him,'' says Castiglione. ``He had a detachment. I used to take
it all to heart. Losses really bothered me. But Bob had a saying.
`It's not my life and it's not my wife,' he would remind me. That's
really helped me the past seven or eight years. I love what I'm
doing, and I care about the Red Sox, but it's still a game.''
</P>
<P>
   As he nears the end of his second decade here, Castiglione is in
an ideal broadcasting groove. He's got the institutional memory so

FAVOR-HAMILTON RENEWS PRIORITIES

<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ At 36, Regina Jacobs is running better than ever.
At 31, so is Suzy Favor-Hamilton, which should make for an electric
duel in Sunday afternoon's 1,500-meter final.
</P>
<P>
   Both women credit their growth to experience, but of very
different kinds. For Jacobs, the changes over the years have been
technical: more iron, better diet, refinements in running form. For
Favor-Hamilton, the growth has been born first of misfortune, then
of outright tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The injury, first of all, woke me up and made me realize I may
not have a second chance,'' said Favor-Hamilton of the left
Achilles' tendon she tore in February 1999 at an indoor 1,500-meter
race in Boston, where her winning time of 1:58.92 still tied the
American record. ``I knew I had so much to give that I hadn't even
stepped into yet. And my brother's death really changed my life. I
realized I may not be here tomorrow. I have to do things now. I
can't wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Waiting is what everyone had been doing since her days at the
University of Wisconsin, where the gorgeous 14-time All-American
was the biggest star ever, winning 23 Big 10 titles and nine NCAA
crowns, a record that still stands. Although she made the Olympic
teams in both 1992 and 1996, her career since graduation has seldom
lived up to expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``In '92 when I just came out of college, I had a lot of
endorsements, a lot of modeling opportunities, and I was pretty
much doing all of them,'' said Favor-Hamilton. ``I kind of lost
sight of the big picture.''
</P>
<P>
   That picture came painfully back into focus last September with
the suicide of her 37-year-old brother, Dan, who suffered from
manic depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why it takes a death to sometimes change
people,'' she said. ``In my case, it's made a positive of
everything. The feeling I had after he died, I'm never going to let
that feeling leave me. I felt hurt and upset, but it also made me
feel I could conquer the world, that I'm ready to do great
things.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the first things the married Suzy Hamilton did after the
death was return Favor to her name, in honor of Dan. Another was to
fly to Ireland for physical therapy with the renowned Gerard
Hartmann, in a desperate attempt to salvage her career. After 10
days of treatment so painful she cried every day, squirming to get
away from the hot wand Hartmann applied to break up the scar
tissue, Favor-Hamilton was running again.
</P>
<P>
   After missing the entire 1999 season, Favor-Hamilton came back
to run her first 1,500 meters April 30, breaking a 15-year-old meet
record with her time of 4 minutes 5.13 seconds. She has run
consistently well ever since, including a spectacular effort last
month at the Prefontaine Classic, when she took a strong early lead
only to be nipped at the wire by Romania's Gabriela Szabo, ranked
No. 1 in the world last year at the distance. Favor-Hamilton's
time, 4:00.79, ranks as the second best in the world this year,
setting the scene for a fight to the wire Sunday with Jacobs, a
strong medal contender in Sydney whose personal best for the
distance, 4:00.35, was set just last year.
</P>
<P>
   The two women are not friendly, perhaps in part a residue of the
early success Favor-Hamilton achieved in the marketplace, not on
the track. ``It seems like there's just kind of always a tension,''
said Favor-Hamilton. ``You feel it. Maybe it's more from her. I'm
just out there doing what I have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Jacobs: ``I think we're very different. The common thing we
share is we both want to win and we're in the same race, so
naturally that would breed a huge rivalry.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, it's one Favor-Hamilton is finally ready for. Both women
dominated their heats here, with Jacobs leading the field in
4:06.16 and Favor-Hamilton in 4:10.29. But more than that,
Favor-Hamilton knows the time is now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought I could wait, I could wait, I have another
year,'' she said, reflecting on her brother's death. ``I don't feel
like that now.''

MORALES VOWS TO IMPROVE TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ While his second-half spark wasn't enough for the
Revolution to overcome the MetroStars, newcomer Jose Luis Morales
promises his play _ and the team _ will get better soon.
</P>
<P>
   Morales, the first Spaniard to play in Major League Soccer,
arrived in the United States Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half Saturday, he darted onto the field and was
impressive throughout his stint.
</P>
<P>
   Revolution coach Fernando Clavijo liked what he saw. ``You can
see that he's not 100 percent yet,'' he said. ``He's going to be an
impact player.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Physically, it felt pretty good out there when I got on the
field,'' said Morales, through an interpreter, referring to the
fact he hasn't played a game in almost two weeks. ``It was a little
different with us losing, 1-0, when I came out, so it was tough to
get used to the first game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two games from now, I'll have no trouble adjusting to the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   The team will get better with more practice time together, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Morales, who scored 51 goals in his seven-year professional
career in Spain, said he'll train during practices. ``You can get
the rhythm a bit and after a couple of games, I'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Morales doesn't speak English, so he can't tell his teammates
much right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know everybody's name but I can't say it in English to get
their attention,'' Morales said. ``You don't know all the other
players, they don't know about me. In a regular game, your team
knows how you play and you know how they play, as well as where
they give you the ball. You get to know each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerning Saturday's 2-0 loss, Morales said: ``We're unlucky;
we gave up a goal in the first five minutes and we clearly had more
opportunities than they did, and if we hadn't given up that goal,
we would have had a better result.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no specific way to score goals. It's just a bad
stretch for the team. It seems unbelievable the goals that we've
missed so far. Once we get a couple of them to go in, though,
they'll all start to go in for us.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no question Morales will enjoy playing in the United
States. ``They criticize you for your play there, while here, they
come to have a good time and to see good plays and to cheer you
on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So he knows better days are ahead. ``I'm very happy, I'm very
content to be a Revolution player,'' Morales said. ``I'm going to
try to work as hard as I can to help my teammates on and off the
field.''

REVOLUTION DOOMED BY MENTAL MISTAKES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ The Revolution lost again Saturday _ a 2-0 defeat
to the MetroStars marked their sixth straight game without a
victory _ but they gained some compensation with the brief, but
dynamic, debut of Jose Luis Morales.
</P>
<P>
   Of the last 18 MLS points, the Revolution have earned only 1.
They surrendered their Eastern Division lead last month and now
trail the MetroStars by 12 points. They appear to be following the
pattern started in 1997, when they set a league record with a
nine-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   This game began on the wrong foot for the Revolution, as Brian
Dunseth was outmaneuvered by Alex Comas, who gave the MetroStars
the lead in the third minute.
</P>
<P>
   Comas was isolated on Dunseth as Daniel Hernandez lofted a
45-yard free kick. Comas shook off Dunseth just inside the penalty
area, spun to his left, controlled the ball, and jabbed a shot into
the right side of the net as Juergen Sommer advanced.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the Revolution seemed desperate. They struggled with
balancing a sense of panic with the calmness necessary to recover.
And only after Morales entered, less than 48 hours after his
arrival from Spain, did the Revolution display enough cohesion and
subtlety to unbalance a confident and hard-charging MetroStars
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal was not to give up an easy goal, not make mistakes,''
Revolution coach Fernando Clavijo said. ``I always say the game is
90 minutes, and when the referee blows the whistle the game is on.
We made a mental mistake and they took advantage of it, and after
that we were chasing the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we also played well after that. But we seem to need an
open net to finish. Everyone strikes the ball well and into the
corner of the net in practice. In the game, the goal seems to
shrink and the goalkeepers seem to get bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars seemed more dangerous offensively with Colombian
strikers Comas and Adolfo ``El Tren'' Valencia and a fluent
midfield game. They set the tone with hard tackling in midfield and
the Revolution needed much of the first half to adjust to the pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take responsibility for the first goal,'' Dunseth said. ``I
went up to get my head on the ball, but instead of clearing it I
knocked it down in front of his path.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we weren't physical enough with them. We need to be
tougher mentally. We need to be kicking people all over the field,
so any time they have the ball we at least have a body on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sommer, replacing Jeff Causey in goal, had little chance to stop
the first goal but made an impressive save on Mark Chung in the
50th minute. Morales, who replaced Dunseth (groin strain) after
halftime, was effective from his first touch on. In the 53d minute,
Morales and Mauricio Ramos combined to set up Wolde Harris, but
Harris's left-footed shot went high after he had rounded goalkeeper
Mike Ammann.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball took a hop on me and I took my eye off it, but no
excuses,'' Harris said. ``But those are goals that will make or
break you. Those chances stayed in the back of our minds.''
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars clinched the victory in the 62d minute on an
excellent play by Petter Villegas, who made a fantastic dummy,
allowing him to glide past Mauricio Wright and then play a
give-and-go with Valencia. Villegas was on the verge of being
offside as he finished into an open net, and the Revolution
protested.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution, though, went on the offensive and seemed capable
of breaking through, especially after the MetroStars' Billy Walsh
was ejected for a foul on Jamar Beasley in the 78th minute. Beasley
suffered a neck injury and was taken to Norwood Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Against Columbus (a 4-1 loss Wednesday) we didn't show up to
play,'' Clavijo said. ``This time we did show up to play.''

BELL TRIED TO NOTCH AN ASSIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN VELLANTE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They were boyhood chums growing up in Tampa, realized their
life-long ambitions of playing in the big leagues, and were
teammates in Houston in 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Within the span of eight days last December, they were traded _
Carl Everett to the Red Sox and Derek Bell to the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Everett is, said Bell, ``like my little brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Bell tried his darnedest to intervene on Everett's
behalf when the Red Sox outfielder pulled a nutty after being
ejected in the second inning by plate umpire Ronald Kulpa over
where he should be standing in the batter's box.
</P>
<P>
   While Red Sox manager Jimy Williams and coaches Wendell Kim and
Tommy Harper did their best to keep Everett away from Kulpa, whom
he had already bumped and head-butted, Bell came running in from
right field to lend a helping hand.
</P>
<P>
   He's convinced if he got there sooner, Everett would have gone
to the dugout a lot quieter than he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like a little brother to me,'' said Bell, ``so I'm pretty
much the closest person besides his wife who can calm him down.
I've known him since I was a kid and (was) trying to make sure he
didn't get into serious, serious, serious trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just went in there to tell him to get his ass in the dugout
before I grab him, pick him up, and take him over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell was intercepted by Mets manager Bobby Valentine, who later
said, despite the Everett-Bell relationship, he wasn't too excited
about Bell's actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think he had to get involved,'' said Valentine. ``I
know he was trying to calm him down, but I didn't think that was
his place. They played together and know each other well, but he
shouldn't have gotten that close.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell said although Valentine kept him at arm's length from
Everett, he was able to get his message across.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking to him all the time,'' he said. ``I told him,
`Let's go, don't have me grab you.' He knows I don't pay attention
to his attitude. I just wanted to say a few things to him to calm
him down. If I had known he was going to go off like that, I would
have tried to get there sooner. As soon as I got up there, he
calmed down and went into the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows that he can get as mad as he wants to, but he knows
that I'll also tell him things (suspension) that will happen if he
keeps it up. He's one of the best outfielders in the league, has a
long-term deal, and I'm very proud of him. I told him, `Don't let
me down, get in the dugout.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That he did, but then he banged his fist against the bat rack,
threw a bat onto the field, and knocked the water coolers off the
top step of the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't the first time Valentine had seen Everett take
things to the edge.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, when Everett was a member of the Mets, he was ejected
in a game against the Marlins and went jaw-to-jaw with plate umpire
Larry Poncino. When Valentine came out to restore the peace,
Everett flung him to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The game story in the New York Daily News quoted Valentine as
saying: ``He threw me down like a Beanie Baby.'' When asked about
the incident Saturday, all Valentine would say was, ``I'd rather
not talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' Mike Hampton, who was on the mound when Everett was
tossed, said he wasn't surprised by the outburst.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, not really,'' he said. ``I played with him two years (in
Houston, 1998 and '99). I know how he gets sometimes. When he
believes in something, he lets you know about it. He loves the
game. He has a passion for it. Sometimes, he just goes too far.''
</P>
<P>
   Mets catcher Mike Piazza offered his view on what transpired.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Kulpa) asked him to get back into the batter's box and he
lost it. He just freaked out. He was upset. As far as I could see,
his foot was very close to the plate, on the line or over the line,
and the umpire said they had looked at it and they were going to
enforce it and obviously they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he brought it to Kulpa's attention, Piazza said, ``I
didn't say a thing. As soon as he got in the box, the umpire said,
`Carl, you've got to get in the batter's box, you have to move back
a bit.' Then they started arguing a bit, Everett moved up a bit,
drew a line, and said to (Kulpa), `This is the line and as long as
my foot is on the line, I'm OK.'
</P>
<P>
   ``They said a few more words and then when he was really getting
upset, I was out of there. He was not in a good mood. I didn't want
to get in the cross-fire. It's an unfortunate incident. Any time
you bump an umpire, that's not good. You can't do that. It's
unfortunate.''
