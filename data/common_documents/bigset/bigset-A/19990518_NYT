<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israelis overwhelmingly elected Ehud Barak, the
Labor Party leader, as prime minister on Monday, rejecting the
tumultuous leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, whose galvanizing
character has dominated Israel for three years.
</P>
<P>
   In a complete reshuffling of the political deck, Israelis also
remade their parliament: The right wing withered as the center grew
with four new parties, changing the balance of power.
</P>
<P>
   Because Barak can now assemble a large block of secular parties,
he has the option to form a government without any ultra-Orthodox
representation. The ultra-Orthodox appear to have lost their
exclusive role as a swing vote between left and right to the
Russian immigrants and other centrists.
</P>
<P>
   By early Tuesday, with 94 percent of the vote counted, Barak was
leading with 56.1 percent of the vote, to Netanyahu's 43.74
percent. It was the second time that Israel had elected a prime
minister directly. Barak now has 45 days in which to form a
government.
</P>
<P>
   A highly decorated former general, Barak, 57, is a dovish hawk
in the image of his mentor, Yitzhak Rabin, and the vote is a
resounding call for a revival of the languishing
Israeli-Palestinian peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Yitzhak is looking down on us from where he may, he knows
that we together will fulfill his legacy,'' Barak said in his
victory speech. ``We need to strengthen our country's security by
moving forward to peace agreements.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak also sounded a call for unity. ``It is my intention to be
everyone's prime minister,'' he said. ``All of Israel is part of
each of us, and we extend a courageous hand to all, to secular and
religious, to those of Ashkenazi and of Sephardic background, to
those who immigrated from the former Soviet Union and from
Ethiopia, to the Arabs, the Bedouins and the Circassians.''
</P>
<P>
   Within 35 minutes of the first television exit polls, before
Barak made any public comment, Netanyahu not only conceded defeat,
but stepped down as the leader of the conservative Likud Party.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank and Gaza, Palestinian officials gloated over
the political demise of a leader whom they considered hostile and
intransigent. Israeli Radio reported open celebrations in the
office of Paesltinian leader Yasser Arafat, who called to
congratulate Barak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Netanyahu fell into the trash bin of history,'' Fraih Abu
Meddien, the Palestinian justice minister said in an interview in
Gaza. ``He will be gone forever and good riddance. He's a racist
and no other Israeli leader will ever be as bad as he was. The
Palestinian people were patient for three years through his
arrogance. We helped bring him down. We are the ones who made this
statue fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before midnight in Tel Aviv, a huge celebration erupted
in Yitzhak Rabin Square, the site of the late prime minister's
assassination. With mixed emotions, tens of thousands of mostly
young Israelis both cheered Barak's victory and lit candles in
honor of Rabin, who was assassinated in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rabin, we have won!'' they shouted repeatedly into the balmy
evening air, crying and hugging each other.
</P>
<P>
   At the Tel Aviv Hilton Hotel, a few miles away, Netanyahu, a
fixture in Israeli politics for 15 years, strode off the political
stage quickly, cleanly, and with cordial congratulations to his
opponent. Flanked by his wife, Sarah, and by a grim Ariel Sharon,
his foreign minister, Netanyahu, with a serene look on his face,
addressed weeping supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nation decided and we respect that decision,'' Netanyahu
said, stunning his audience, which is unaccustomed to the sight of
their prime minister conceding anything. ``That is the way it has
to be in a democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's Likud Party, traditionally one of the two major
parties of Israel, suffered from his collapse at the polls.
Netanyau's Likud coalition held 32 seats in 1996, and the party was
down to about 20 with slightly fewer than half the votes counted.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the defectors left for Shas, the ultra-Orthodox
Sephardic party. In a stunning gain, Shas seemed to have garnered
six new seats in the new parliament, giving it about 17, making it
the third largest party after Likud and Labor, election analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
   But a larger representation does not mean more power. ``Shas is
in for four lean years now,'' Shahar Ilan, a religion reporter for
the newspaper Haaretz said Monday, ``whether it is a barely wanted
coalition partner or whether it remains outside.''
</P>
<P>
   While Shas had endorsed Netanyahu, it has swung between left and
right governments before as a supporter of the peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   But in these elections and probably in the new parliament,
Russian immigrants, who seem to have split their ballots between
the two candidates, represented the swing vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We resisted all efforts to take sides,'' Natan Sharansky,
leader of the Russians' Yisrael Baaliyah Party, said in an
interview. ``We were the party of the new immigrants, but now we
can be considered simply as the one real moderate force, like a
bridge between secular and nonsecular, left and right.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Look, I'm sorry for Bibi, we're old friends.'' He
said the defeat of Netanyahu was ``mainly personal, not
ideological.''
</P>
<P>
   But part of Netanyahu's defeat was not merely a rejection of
him, but of the right wing's perceived obstructionist agenda on the
peace effort. Most Israelis not only endorse the peace effort, but
accept that a Palestinian state is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   According to a statement from the prime minister's office,
President Clinton sent Netanyahu a message: ``I appreciate the hard
work you did. You're a strong man with a strong historical
awareness and we all believe you will be back.''
</P>
<P>
   Also according to the statement, Netanyahu responded, ``Thank
you very much but I'm taking a long vacation.''

</P>
<P>
   Many Israelis were driving through the streets beeping their
horns, or popping the corks on champagne bottle. ``As soon as Bibi
said he was resigning, the champagne came out as did the
pistachios, cake and popcorn,'' said Lisa Feinmesser, 51, an
administrative assistant in Jerusalem. ``We're so sick of the
man.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking drawn and defeated, Gila Gamliel, a 24-year-old Likudnik
who lost her bid for parliament, said, ``Despite the great
accomplishments of the government, everyone was against us and
against the prime minister out of personal hatred.''
</P>
<P>
   A kibbutz-born Israeli who spent 35 years in the army and
retired as chief of staff, Barak is brainy and complex. He has
confidence in his own judgments, which are based, like those of any
serious military strategist, as much on input as intuition. Friends
say he is his own best counsel.
</P>
<P>
   He has conducted his campaign like a military exercise. Building
on a network of army buddies, he revitalized the Labor Party's
aging infrastructure with a far more professional campaign on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Barak also relied on layers of American consultants, including
two top American pollsters, who field-tested every question raised
by Barak about the mood of the Israeli public and the sectors
within it.
</P>
<P>
   He personally sought to commandeer a remake of the Labor Party,
which is traditionally both leftist and elitist in a peculiarly
Israeli combination, into a party of the center. He ran at the head
of the One Israel coalition, forged with Meimad, a moderate
Orthodox group, and the Sephardic Gesher Party of David Levy, the
Moroccan-born former foreign minister of Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   As a moderate at the helm of the left, he sees himself following
the lead of Bill Clinton and Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's political advertising has stressed his military
background, which includes a string of derring-do missions that are
an integral part of Israeli legend. His campaign has repeatedly
broadcast images of him liberating a Sabena airplane from
Palestinian terrorists, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, he has said he would move quickly to kick start
the moribund Israeli-Palestinian peace effort, to plan the
withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon, and to reopen
negotiations with Syria over Lebanon and the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Before the elections, many Israelis said they considered Barak
and Netanyahu to be cut from the same cloth, as Ashkenai members of
the elite who both served in the same elite military unit and both
studied in the United States. Israelis said they were confused
about what differentiated the candidates' stand on peace, since
both said they supported a tough peace with security.
</P>
<P>
   But the two men hold very different views about Israel's
relative position in the Mideast, which fundamentally shape
different approaches to peacemaking. Netanyahu believed Israel to
be in a constant state of threat from its Arab neighbors,
approached them with suspicion and refused to make concessions
until concessions were given.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, on the other hand, sees Israel as the strongest country
in a tough neighborhood, negotiating from a vantage point of
greater military might, higher economic standing and a sounder,
more democratic political system.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks peace agreements must be reached before conditions are
perfect, and that relationships should be sown to encourage
cooperation on security issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to give a new momentum to peace agreements,'' he said
in an interview in April. ``I'm not going to compromise any of our
vital interest. I will definitely fight against terror, I did it
all my life. But I learned during many years, decades of fighting
that the right way to bring about personal security to Israelis and
overall security to Israel is through peace agreement with our
neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Four and a quarter million Israelis voted, almost all the adults
in the country. Voter turn-out is always high here. Statistics say
it is 80 percent, but, given that about 10 percent of the
population lives abroad and there are no absentee ballots, the
figure is closer to 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of Israelis have been arriving from abroad to vote,
too.

 &HT;    With Ewing hurting, Knicks dig in again
 &HT;    By Kirk Bohls
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Patrick Ewing was grimacing and laboring like a
man staggering through the desert by the end of Sunday's game five
in Miami. Worn down by injury, depleted by exhaustion, he pushed
the boundaries of his threshold for pain to help win a first-round
playoff series for the Knicks that had everything riding on the
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs, futures and major franchise decisions were at stake when
Ewing's performance left Allan Houston in position to hit a
dramatic game-winning shot that propelled the Knicks into the
second round, where they will face the Atlanta Hawks in game one
tonight at the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Another matchup with a Georgetown center _ this time Dikembe
Mutombo _ brings another test of Ewing's physical limitations.
Ewing is expected to start game one even though he was writhing in
pain during the third and fourth quarters Sunday because of a
muscle strain in his rib cage. This is on top of his sore left
Achilles' tendon and the tendinitis in his knees.
</P>
<P>
   How far can he go before his tolerance for pain snaps? It seems
almost unfair to expect him to replicate his 22-point, 11-rebound
performance in game five on 48 hours' rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can expect that,'' Coach Jeff Van Gundy said
during a conference call before his team departed for Atlanta on
Monday. ``On Sunday, that was a man who went above and beyond in
terms of pain tolerance. I don't think you can do that on a nightly
basis. Hopefully, he can play effectively. With the schedule, who
knows? Whatever he can give us, we're thankful for.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing's health will be pivotal to a series that may lack the
soap opera subplots of the Knicks' playoff rivalry with the Heat _
especially since these two teams have not met in the post-season
since 1971 _ but is still vital to the job security of Van Gundy,
whose status is considered unstable unless the team advances to the
conference finals. But with the Heat series so emotionally and
physically draining, Van Gundy is wary of a hangover.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be right both mentally, emotionally and physically
as much as we can,'' Van Gundy said. ``We don't want to give one
away from a mental standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   The intense edge of their series with the Heat was a great
motivation for the Knicks, but it is not as if they have not had
their brushes with the Hawks. On April 9, the gangly, sharp-edged
Mutombo threw an elbow that knocked out one of Chris Childs' teeth.
After he had put his tooth in his locker following the game, Childs
vowed revenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to get him back,'' Childs said. ``It's going to be a
12-round fight. You can call Don King. It was an intentional elbow.
I'd already passed the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   After the league fined Mutombo $7,500 and Childs cooled down,
the Knicks' game against the Hawks on April 28 unfolded without
further incident. But in that last meeting of the season, there was
a competitive back-and-forth that surfaced between Latrell Sprewell
and Steve Smith as they tried to one-up each other.
</P>
<P>
   While the Heat-like animosity is not there, there will be an
edge to this four-of-seven-game series if only because both teams
are physical. On the surface, the No. 4-seeded Hawks do not elicit
awe. They are a bare-bones team that relies on three rugged players
for the heavy lifting _ Mutombo, Smith and Mookie Blaylock. Without
the injured Alan Henderson, the Hawks are even more limited
offensively. Time after time, their core of veterans has relied on
intimidating, tenacious defense and has got by despite injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't realize how talented they are,'' Van Gundy said.
``They beat Indiana three out of four, and beat us two of three.
They quietly and efficiently go about their business.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks took the season series against the Knicks with
Blaylock leading the way. As many point guards before him have
done, Blaylock took advantage of the Knicks' soft perimeter
defense. Childs, who has been limping with a thigh contusion, is
the better defender against Blaylock. But most often, Charlie Ward,
who has had difficulty keeping track of Blaylock, will be on the
spot.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the defensive burden will fall on Houston as well.
Defending against Miami's Dan Majerle and Voshon Lenard is far less
risky than trying to stop Smith. Houston has had problems trying to
limit Smith's diverse game. He can shoot a three-pointer, post up
with his 6-foot-8-inch frame, drive and hit his free throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve Smith is different,'' Van Gundy said. ``Reggie Miller is
a big-shot player, but more catch-and-shoot. Steve has a very
versatile game. He can hurt you in so many ways. He's a legit
6-foot-8, great size. And so Allan has got to be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   So does any Knick who dares to venture in the paint for a layup.
Mutombo is always a threat to wield an elbow and shatter a nose. He
has broken three noses this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes teams jump-shooting teams,'' Van Gundy said. ``It's
also foolish just to shoot over him. You've got to be
intelligent.''
</P>
<P>
   One way to dilute Mutombo's impact is to make him defend his
man. And if Ewing is able to drag his body on the floor, his range
will force Mutombo to do something besides sit back and swat away.
Whatever Ewing has left will be appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   Often this season, Ewing has not been thought of in such
praiseworthy terms. There were cries for his role at age 36 to be
reduced, for him to defer to the up-tempo style some of his
teammates wanted to run. There were times when Ewing did step back
this season, but Sunday was not one of them. Too much on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Him getting out on the floor uplifts our team,'' Van Gundy
said. ``In the fourth quarter, when he got another injury, and his
Achilles was killing him, and he plays like he did, that to me says
it all about him.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Van Gundy, Ewing's unwavering supporter for 10 years,
understands the limitations on heroics. Before the Knicks' series
with the Hawks begins, he will most likely have the same kind of
conversation he had with Ewing before the Heat matchup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him that I didn't want him to be frustrated with what
he couldn't do, because he couldn't be Patrick Ewing the whole
Miami series,'' Van Gundy said. ``I wanted him to think about what
he could do to win the series, because that was more than enough.''

 &HT;    Grand jury to hear case against dead kids' mom
 &HT;    By Christian Davenport
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Williamson County prosecutors seeking to indict
Tina Marie Cornelius _ whose children died, authorities say, after
she left them injured in a creek bed _ will present their case to a
grand jury today.
</P>
<P>
   Cornelius was charged with two counts of abandoning a child
after police found her in a Corpus Christi apartment April 28 _
nine days after her children were found dead in Brushy Creek.
</P>
<P>
   Autopsies found that Amanda Lee Miller, 3, suffocated and that
Dominick Logan Cornelius, 2, died of a fractured skull. A Round
Rock couple found their bodies in the creek just south of Hutto,
about 20 miles northeast of Austin.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Ken Anderson said the grand jury, which is
expected to consider the case until the end of June, could produce
other charges, but he would not elaborate. Nor would he comment on
who injured the children or who brought them to the creek.
</P>
<P>
   He said he will call and question Capt. Linda Bunte, the head of
the county's criminal investigations division, and present about an
hour's worth of testimony starting at 11 a.m. He said he would not
call any other witnesses today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to do everything we can to get all the facts and
get them correct,'' Anderson said. ``And when we get them figured
out, we'll ask the grand jury to return any charges that are
justified by the evidence. It's my hope we will find out who is
responsible for the death of these children.''
</P>
<P>
   Since her arrest, Cornelius has been held in Williamson County
Jail in lieu of $200,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   A criminal complaint filed in court states that Cornelius told
investigators she saw her children ``when they were injured and
lying in the creek bed or ditch.'' The complaint charges that she
left them there and ``indicated that she did not go back to help
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Rhea, Cornelius' court-appointed attorney, declined to
comment on the specifics of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Cornelius moved to Austin from Parker, Ariz., about two years
ago. Once here, she worked at a pizza restaurant and a beauty
supply store and as a waitress. She attended auto mechanics classes
and told her co-workers in a Wal-Mart automotive department that
she hoped one day to work as a mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   She also worked as an exotic dancer, and employees of a topless
bar, said she worked the day after her children were found lying
lifeless in Brushy Creek.
</P>
<P>
   Two daysbefore the bodies of her children were found, Cornelius
met an Austin glass installer at a downtown music festival. That
man has said she told him that her children died after falling off
a cliff while with one of the children's fathers.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, about April 21 or 22, she went to Corpus
Christi, where Mauricio Alaniz, 31, said he met her at a carnival.
In an interview, Alaniz said she told him that her boyfriend took
her children and she did not know whether they were dead or alive.
</P>
<P>
   Alaniz said he spent almost five days with Cornelius before
police found her in his friend's apartment and brought her in for
questioning.

MONDESI ON THE RISE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ This is dangerous ground. Everyone wants to be so
careful. It is as if they all agree upon the desired destination,
yet to actually discuss the journey is taboo.
</P>
<P>
   But with each passing week, Raul Mondesi is making it more
difficult to worry about some imagined jinx. It could be real this
time. Mondesi could be ready to take that leap from very good
player to superstar.
</P>
<P>
   The same way the Cubs' Sammy Sosa fulfilled long-held high
expectations by exploding to the next level last season, the
Dodgers right fielder could be poised for a breakout year.
</P>
<P>
   No one claims Mondesi is on the way to a 60-homer season, but he
just might be on the verge of something special, of reaching some
new rarefied air.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's knocking at the door of greatness,'' said Dodgers
general manager Kevin Malone. ``Being a great player means you have
to be consistent and do it over the course of time. But he's
definitely right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi has always been considered a very good player. He oozes
ability, plays hard, loves the game. The 1994 NL Rookie of the Year
has averaged 25 home runs and 86 RBI and batted .295 during his
five full seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Yet more was always expected. For all he's done, he could appear
somewhat raw _ as if there was more to be tapped, some deeper
reservoir of ability fully surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   Now Mondesi is making noise as though he were ready to hone all
that almost- envied potential. He came out of the weekend tied with
Arizona's Jay Bell for the National League lead in home runs (13),
was fourth in RBI (32) and seventh in runs (28). No Dodger has been
the NL home run champ since Duke Snider hit 43 for Brooklyn in
1956. Mondesi is also hitting .281 and has nine stolen bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's already one of the stars of the game,'' said Cubs manager
Jim Riggleman. ``To go to the level of Sosa and (Ken) Griffey and
(Mark) McGwire, certainly I think he's going to make that next
step.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it's this year or not, I don't know, but he's going to
be one of the superstars of the game. He's going to put up numbers
that just can't be ignored, because he can do it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Dodgers, though, are reluctant to discuss his rising
status, as if the pressure and spotlight could turn this into
another false start in joining the game's elite.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson seems almost uncomfortable with
the topic. ``He's hit some home runs before, hasn't he?'' Johnson
said. Johnson briefly moved Mondesi from cleanup to fifth in the
lineup last month when he appeared to press.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi, 28, spoke boldly of wanting to become the NL MVP after
a strong '97 season but now is trying to eliminate boasting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to try and do my job every day and not say too much,''
he said. ``I'm trying to do something different. I want to play my
game the way I've been playing. Play hard every day, try to give
100 percent each game and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   What's been happening early this season is, the less he talks
and the more he plays, the more others talk about him.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi has always been known as a wild swinger, but Dodgers
coach Manny Mota said much of his success this season can be
attributed to his finally chasing fewer bad pitches and being more
selective at the plate. He sees no limit to a disciplined Mondesi.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still growing, he's still learning, still improving,''
Mota said. ``There's always room to get better, and he's doing
that. He's showing you what patience can do for you, and being
selective. And he's not losing any of his aggressiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the potential, in my opinion, to be the best player in
the business. He has that kind of ability and tools. He can put
everything together; he has a chance do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi's skills, his Dominican background and a possible
breakout season, have many comparing him to Sosa, who made a
similar jump last year with his 66-home run season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a natural comparison,'' Riggleman said.
``Physically they're quite a bit alike. They both have tremendous
power, they're five-tool players. Both of them can steal a base,
throw, play defense, hit for average, power. There are a lot of
similarities. As young players coming in, they did good things, but
they're just got better and better. ''
</P>
<P>
   Said Malone: ``I think it's a good comparison. I think Raul has
as much ability, or more. Sammy had a great year last year. I think
he's matured as a hitter himself. I mean, years ago the book on
Sammy was he would chase about anything out of the strike zone.
Last year he laid off some pitches, got some good pitches to hit
and showed a lot more discipline at the plate. And I think that's
what you're seeing this year with Raul.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi and Sosa, however, would rather avoid any comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great player, a five-tool player and in some ways he
compares to me,'' Sosa said. ``Right now, he's swinging the bat
real well and doing great. But I don't let people compare me to
anybody. I never really notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's on the way up. I hope he continues taking care of
business. It's a long season, there's a long ways to go and I just
hope he continues . . . doing a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi shakes his head at the mere suggestion he compares to
Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why? Why do you have to do that?'' he asked. ``I want to be
Mondesi. I don't want to be like anybody else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is saying, `You can do great this year,' and then
next year you don't do (anything). I want to play at least 10 more
years. Barry Bonds, he never hit 60 homers and he's the best player
in baseball to me. Tony Gwynn, he never hit 35-40 (homers) and he's
got 3,000 hits and is going into the Hall of Fame. You don't have
to hit 70 homers to be a great player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never hit 40, but people have a lot of respect for me.
That's what I need. I don't want to be the hero all the time. I
want to do my job and get respect from the people.''
</P>

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
With the shortest NBA season giving way to a longer-than-expected
offseason, the Rockets on Monday finally had some time on their
hands.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In considering changes, they have time to plot every strategy,
study every free agent and view tape of every collegian. They can
call staff meetings until they believe themselves trapped in the
lockout again.
</P>
<P>
   But when it's time to act, they will likely find there is little
they can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't ever feel like our hands our tied,'' Rockets vice
president Robert Barr said. ``I always feel we'll be able to pull
something off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, it's the harder way. There have to be trades to change
things. We have two exceptions (to the salary cap). We're not going
to get a big-time star with a $2 million exception. But I feel we
have to do something to put us back on top. I'm not going to settle
for where we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr is not alone in his hopes to change the roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to need some personnel changes,'' forward
Scottie Pippen said. ``I think we can be better.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Pippen thinks a complete overhaul is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Myself, Charles (Barkley) and Dream (Hakeem Olajuwon), we're
guys that know our way around the game,'' Pippen said. ``I don't
think age is a factor. When we play together and play well
together, we're pretty dominant.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, that didn't happen as often as the Rockets would
have liked down the stretch in 1999. And their first-round playoff
exit would indicate they weren't quite the title contenders they
proclaimed themselves to be. Still, any changes will more likely
constitute tinkering rather than rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were close but just couldn't get over the hump,'' coach
Rudy Tomjanovich said. ``That was something I really wanted for
this team. I liked this team a lot. It was a great bunch of guys.
They got along very well. And I thought our chemistry was good
considering very little practice time. There wasn't much time,
especially for those young kids to get into a comfort zone to where
they worked on things and really understood the system.''
</P>
<P>
   That will change. However, the roster likely will not change
much. Already over the salary cap and with 11 players under
contract, the Rockets will try to improve with more subtle
adjustments than this past season's addition of Pippen and the
sudden changing of the guards to an all-rookie backcourt of Cuttino
Mobley and Michael Dickerson.
</P>
<P>
   Under the two salary-cap exceptions, the Rockets can sign one
free agent for as much as $2 million and another for up to $1
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to look at our options and what they are and what
is presented,'' Tomjanovich said. ``I'm not going to say we're in a
panic situation. I think we're moving in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   In regard to their own free agents _ Barkley, Sam Mack, Anthony
``Pig'' Miller and Stanley Roberts _ the Rockets must wait for
Barkley to make a decision about retirement and will likely pursue
Mack.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley said he did not want to return unless the Rockets had a
legitimate championship chance, maintaining that he, Pippen and
Olajuwon would be less likely to carry a team next season than this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles and I talked about it,'' Barr said. ``This is the
first time I felt he was kind of serious (about retiring). In time,
when the dust settles, hopefully we'll get him back. I can't
imagine him not being here.
</P>
<P>
   ``He scared me a little this time. He may hang it up. I'm real
concerned with it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barkley has a history of bringing up retirement moments
after a disappointing playoff defeat and then returning.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we played Charles in the playoffs back in '94 and 95, he
was talking about retirement then,'' Tomjanovich said. ``I've heard
it before.''
</P>
<P>
   A key trade-deadline addition, Mack returned to the Rockets with
a more professional manner than he displayed in his first stint
with the team. But they must decide if Mack would perform as well
with the long-term deal he seeks as he did in the last season of a
contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Sam Mack earned a spot,'' Barr said. ``It was a great
trade for us. He obviously can shoot the ball. Sam plays hard. He
helped us out a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   There are few high-profile free agents to chase, especially with
no more than $2 million to offer. And with few high-dollar players
on the market, teams with more money available might further
diminish the free agents the Rockets could afford.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch Richmond and Terrell Brandon are the big-name guards but
will almost surely be out of the Rockets' price range. The likes of
Haywoode Workman and Sherman Douglas might be looking for the sort
of contract the Rockets could offer.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rockets are more likely to do their free-agent shopping
in the frontcourt, where candidates will have to accept that a
starter's spot is likely out of reach. Gary Trent could be an
attractive possibility, because the Mavericks cannot offer more
than the Rockets. Tyrone Nesby, John Wallace, Rodney Rogers, Cedric
Ceballos, Corliss Williamson or Bo Outlaw could be targeted if
interested in the Rockets' limited playing time and finances. Among
the top free-agent forwards out of the Rockets' range are Joe
Smith, Grant Long and, if he opts for free agency, Vin Baker.
</P>
<P>
   The draft offers similar limits. The Rockets have three picks,
but the first is at No. 22 in a year that figures to offer 13 to 15
players in the upper echelon. The Rockets' other two picks are in
the second round.
</P>
<P>
   So with free-agent and rookie options limited, most of the
improvement will have to come from within. But the Rockets believe
that can happen, considering they won't be rushed like they were
this season, trying to establish a role for the difficult-to-define
Pippen while integrating seven other newcomers, including two
rookie starters, into the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel with the additions we made to this team this year we
made steps in the right direction,'' Tomjanovich said. ``We
improved our win-loss percentage by 12 points. We did a lot better
defensively. Offensively, we were one of the better teams with
field-goal percentage. We improved in number of rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were still (ranked) low on offensive rebounds, turnovers
were high, and I really felt we drafted to get more athletic and to
be a running team. That's an area that we can really improve on. We
wound up getting more (fast) breaks as the year went on, but our
efficiency wasn't as high as it should have been. All those things
are things we'll try to work on in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets' young guards, Tomjanovich said, will especially
benefit from a full training camp, the summer tournament that in
1998 was a lockout casualty, and the usual growth heading into a
second season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's such a tremendous jump from your first year to your
second,'' Tomjanovich said. ``This year should be even more. That
light bulb, really getting it, will turn on.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich also will have time to address changes in the
Rockets' style. Barkley, if he returns, and Olajuwon will still be
used in the low post. But Tomjanovich said he does not want to
depend on that part of the offense as heavily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we were a better pick-and-roll team,'' he said. ``(But)
first of all, the running. That's something every team I've ever
been involved with wants to do. That's something you've got to work
at. Running just to be running isn't a positive. You've got to get
something.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you can do in my position is go out and try to do your
best. You look at your personnel, try to put them in an environment
they can do the best we can. The system is the players we have. If
I had different players, I would be doing different things.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless the Rockets become uncharacteristically trade-happy,
however, he will for the most part have the same players. Whether
subtle changes can bring a big improvement remains to be seen.

ARIZONA TEAMS FACING D-DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sociologists once marveled at the healing property of sports.
How differences in class and race evaporated once fans passed
through a turnstile. How the simple act of cheering for a team
galvanized entire communities.
</P>
<P>
   Ever laughed at a neighbor who painted a team logo on his
garage?
</P>
<P>
   It is D-Day for two franchises, and now all you see are signs
stuck in the earth. Say Yes! Say No! Save Your Team! Save Your
City!
</P>
<P>
   And what once united now divides.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime earlier in the decade, sports gave birth to a terrible
trend, the publicly financed stadium. Among the greatest causes of
spectator angst, the catalyst for severed relationships between a
sports franchise and its community.
</P>
<P>
   It is out of control. In Arizona, one owner already has fallen
from grace; a politician already has taken a bullet in the backside
as payment for a pro-stadium vote. It won't stop until every
professional team in every sport has its own new facility. And it's
too late to change.
</P>
<P>
   You either build them a house or they leave, and as you leave
your own home today, that is very much the ultimatum from the
Cardinals and Coyotes. But really, no hard feelings. Eventually, it
will happen to everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Ever seen a driver ride the merge lane as far as possible,
enraging every motorist patiently waiting in line? Ever noticed how
a wave of copycats inevitably follow the lead? And how they all get
there much faster than you?
</P>
<P>
   That's what is happening here. The Cardinals and the Coyotes are
not trying to set a precedent. They're trying to get in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Think, for a moment, how much smaller sports would be without
publicly financed stadiums. The game would discipline itself back
to the market. Salaries would be somewhat in check.
</P>
<P>
   But after the first ripple of con jobs, it was over. Soon, some
owners were playing with Monopoly money while others were paying
rent. Another wedge between the haves and have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   And now, every owner needs a new stadium to compete with the
colleagues who do, those who have already won their elections.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, it is a defining day in Arizona history. A day that
will shape the future of its sports. A day that will carry much
meaning for franchise thieves, out-of-state owners and
trend-watchers across the country. But win or lose, there is no
turning back.
</P>
<P>
   In football-mad Denver, a winning team and John Elway's lobbying
were enough to make a new stadium palatable. A World Series
appearance did the trick for San Diego, until owners singed voters
by gutting the team.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, the resentment is thick, and some are harking the
death of democracy, accusing Paul Allen of buying an election for
the Seahawks. The same Paul Allen who could privately finance 10
stadiums and still be one of the richest men in history.
</P>
<P>
   And in San Francisco, the good will is over. In 1997, after the
49ers won an election for their new stadium by a mere 1,500 votes,
it was discovered that nine dead people had cast votes. Activists
claim that number was more like 2,000. A lawsuit followed, a judge
turned his head and the 49ers will have their $325 million crib by
2002.
</P>
<P>
   The hostage game played by Robert Kraft and the Patriots has
splintered the Northeast. In Chicago, about 8,000 people a night
are coming to see the White Sox play at Comiskey Park, a stadium
built on notorious arm-twisting politics.
</P>
<P>
   It never ends, and it never really goes away.
</P>
<P>
   This time, there are no signs of foul play in Arizona. Just two
franchises asking for your vote. But the lingering resentment is
out there.
</P>
<P>
   The era of franchise free agency has taken over, gobbling up
everything in sight. Leaving behind waves of ill will for teams
that prevail at the polls, and waves of regret for those that slip
away.
</P>
<P>
   So it's yes or no, friend or foe, and unless a championship is
in the distance, nobody's painting their garage anymore. And while
a sports team will always galvanize its fan base, this is clearly
an era that strains the bond between franchise and community. &QL;

SAYING NO CARRIES COST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once upon a time, a large city was home to a professional
football team.
</P>
<P>
   Fans loved the team. They didn't love the owner.
</P>
<P>
   The owner was perceived as miserly and not very likable. It
seemed like the only time the public saw him was when the team
called a news conference to announce the owner had fired another
coach.
</P>
<P>
   The owner went through coaches the way Henry VIII went through
wives.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the team and its faithful endured some hard
times. But there were good times, too.
</P>
<P>
   When the team won and made the playoffs, the excitement
energized the city and brought the community together as only a
winning sports team can.
</P>
<P>
   Home games sold out.
</P>
<P>
   Then one day, the owner announced he wanted a new downtown
stadium. The owner said the place where his team had played for
years _ christened The Eighth Wonder of the World _ was inferior,
even after millions of taxpayer dollars had been spent to add seats
and suites.
</P>
<P>
   New stadium? Forget it, the public said. The mayor vowed not to
spend public money to appease greedy sports owners.
</P>
<P>
   So the owner moved the team.
</P>
<P>
   He went to another city that offered him everything he wanted. A
new stadium with 67,000 seats and 140 luxury suites and concessions
and parking revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The jilted city shrugged. Let 'em leave. Good riddance.
</P>
<P>
   What's the old country song? ``Thank God and Greyhound She's
Gone''.
</P>
<P>
   Who needs a team? Football isn't essential.
</P>
<P>
   But those who believed it was took heart in the hope that the
city would get another team soon _ as if acquiring one was as
simple as hailing the next taxi cab.
</P>
<P>
   The city began adjusting to life without the NFL. It could watch
other teams play on Sunday. Follow other teams into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The local newspaper conducted a poll. Did readers want the paper
to make their old team _ the one that had moved _ central to its
NFL coverage?
</P>
<P>
   More than 30,000 responded. Two-thirds said not no, but hell no.
They didn't want to be reminded that the team wasn't theirs
anymore. That Steve McNair and Eddie George now played for someone
else.
</P>
<P>
   Out of sight, out of mind. Forget the old team. We'll get a
``new'' one.
</P>
<P>
   A rich businessman announced he would spend $400 million to buy
an expansion team. If the NFL awarded him one, he ``guaranteed'' a
sellout at every home game for five years.
</P>
<P>
   The county voted to fund a new downtown major league baseball
stadium ``and'' a new football palace that would be built if the
NFL awarded the city a team.
</P>
<P>
   An $85,000 scale model of the proposed football stadium was
displayed at this year's Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But the ready cash and stadium plans and sellout guarantee
didn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL gave Cleveland one expansion team. Los Angeles, with the
nation's second-largest TV market, got the other.
</P>
<P>
   So the city without a team looked to other avenues.
</P>
<P>
   The wealthy businessman sent letters to eight NFL owners. ``Dear
Sir, are you interested in selling your team? If so, I would like
to buy it . . .''
</P>
<P>
   He mailed inquiries to the Bears, Eagles, Colts, Raiders,
Vikings, Bills, Patriots and Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   So far, no takers. The Cardinals owner said he wasn't interested
in selling and moving his team again.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wanted to stay here and play in his own new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   So Houston sits.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth-largest city in the country waits.
</P>
<P>
   And pretends it doesn't miss the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Will the city get a team?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   This much is certain: The price tag will far exceed the cost of
keeping the team it had.
</P>
<P>
   Just something to think about when we go to the polls today. &QL;

GIVE DEVILS THEIR DUE IN NCAA GOLF  
 WOMEN'S TEAM LOOKS FOR 7TH TITLE IN '90S 
</HEADLINE>
 DYNASTY-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL HUFFMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a women's college golf program produces 61 All-Pac-10
selections, 37 All-Americans and 14 members of the LPGA Tour, the
conclusion is pretty obvious:
</P>
<P>
   These women are good.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite all of her success stories, Arizona State Coach
Linda Vollstedt still relies on a little luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``These days, with the talent so deep at so many schools, you
can never have enough of it,'' said the superstitious Vollstedt,
whose tournament traditions go back to 1990, the first of a record
six NCAA golf titles.
</P>
<P>
   That was the season that Steve Loy, the former ASU men's golf
coach, gave Vollstedt her ``good luck tennis shoes,'' complete with
emblems of Sun Devils mascot Sparky on the heels. That also was the
year Vollstedt urged her boss, Herman Frazier, to give her team the
first of many inspirational pep talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure why Linda wanted me to speak to the girls that
year because she is such a great motivator herself,'' said Frazier,
a former track star for the Sun Devils who is the school's
associate athletic director. ``But for whatever reason, I did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember she wanted me to show them my 1977 NCAA
championship ring, maybe give them a reason to get one for
themselves. Now I'm there (at the NCAA Tournament) for Linda and
her teams almost every year. And when I don't show up, she gets
down on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Frazier hasn't missed many. He plans to report this
week to Tulsa, where Vollstedt's team will be seeking its second
three-peat in the past seven years. Although not the favorites, the
fifth-ranked Sun Devils, (Grace Park, Caroline Laurens, Jody
Niemann, Tui Selvaratnam and Keri Cornelius) are a definite threat
in the 72-hole tournament that runs Wednesday through Saturday at
Tulsa Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say there's an outside chance that Linda will have her
team ready to go,'' deadpanned Rick LaRose, Arizona's director of
golf, who this year gave up the dual responsibility of coaching the
men's and women's teams to concentrate on the men.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our (No. 2-ranked) women are the best team in the
country,'' LaRose said. ``But for some reason, Linda always gets
her girls up for nationals. In a sense, she's got them right where
she wants them _ again.''
</P>
<P>
   Call it the residual effects of a dynasty. Even during an
``off'' year in 1998-99, when the Sun Devils won only one
tournament, and more recently posted back-to-back, third-place
finishes in the Pac-10 and West Regional, they must be reckoned
with.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it's hard to envision yourself 20 years down the
road,'' said Vollstedt, who became ASU's coach in 1980. ``You never
really expect to create a dynasty. But I was so determined back
then to make it work that I actually had the audacity to think
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Vollstedt played for ASU when golf was a club sport during the
mid-1960s. After graduating in 1969, she went back to earn her
master's degree in math in '71.
</P>
<P>
   Her coaching career actually began in the prep ranks, where one
of her stars at Alhambra High School, Lauri Merten, and Merten's
father, George, helped Vollstedt land the job at ASU. Lauri Merten
was one of those All-Pac-10, All-America, LPGA players who was
mentored by Vollstedt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew right away that I had a passion for it,'' Vollstedt
recalled. ``But it was tough in the beginning. I only made $9,000
each of the first two years. I had to sell my stocks, dip into my
life savings, and even sell some land to keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   If there was a turning point, she said, it was recruiting the
late Heather Farr, who had been a superstar at Xavier College
Preparatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heather really put us on the map and kept recruiting for us
after she left,'' Vollstedt said. ``A lot of good things started to
fall into place during that time (the mid-1980s), even though it
took a while to finally win a championship.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the reign came, it never ended. One good team kept
leading to another, and Vollstedt has passed Pat Summitt, the
Tennessee basketball coach, to become the winningest female coach
in college sports during the 1990s. Summitt's teams have won five
times during the decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six national championships? Not in your wildest dreams,'' said
Vollstedt, who never takes anything for granted. ``For the longest
time, my only thought was, `Let's win one.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Frazier said he knows exactly why Vollstedt's success
snowballed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Linda's very competitive, but she's also very selective about
the kind of kid she takes into her program,'' he said. ``She
doesn't take just good athletes. She takes good people who have
high standards and are all business.''
</P>
<P>
   Vollstedt puts it like this: ``I'm looking for a player who
wants to play the (LPGA) tour, wants to dig deeper, loves the game
and has a great attitude. That's a tough combination to find, but I
know it when I see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Park, who will be the driving force in Tulsa, is one of those
players who met Vollstedt's rules of recruitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thinks Coach is demanding, but to me, she's very
easy to talk to,'' said Park, a sophomore who might turn pro
depending on this week's results.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that a lot of players on other teams don't feel like
they have very good communication with their coaches. But Linda
gets very individual with each of us, pumps us up, and makes every
one of us feel special. That's hard to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Vollstedt will have none of it. Far more difficult, at least to
her, is keeping her lucky tennis shoes on her feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah! I've got them packed,'' she said, getting serious at
the thought. ``But they're so old that I'm going to have to get
some new laces if they're going to stay on my feet. And they
``are'' going to stay on my feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Like everything else with Linda Vollstedt, count on it. &QL;

WITH ONE THRUST OF HARPOON, MAKAH INDIANS RETURN TO WHALING ROOTS

<P>
   NEAH BAY _ For the first time in the memory of all but the
oldest Makah, tribal canoes pulled a gray whale into this Indian
village on Monday after the first successful hunt of the huge
animals in generations.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of tribal members _ from elders bent with age to babies
in their fathers' arms _ lined the beach in a greeting that was
both solemn and chaotic. Prayers were spoken. One Indian did a back
flip off the 30-foot dead whale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today the Makah have brought the whale home,'' tribal elder
George Bowechop told the crowd. ``From this day forward, we need to
stand behind our leaders... to be a living culture.''
</P>
<P>
   With grunts, tribal members hauled the animal ashore on Monday
night and began butchering it to the sound of an ancient Makah
song.
</P>
<P>
   The triumphant beaching of the animal was the day's culmination
of history-making events.
</P>
<P>
   It began in eight minutes of fury that will spark controversy
for years to come. Tribal hunters caught and killed the whale near
Father and Son Rocks in the Pacific off Olympic National Park about
7 a.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal members in a hand-hewn cedar canoe and nearby motor boats
used three harpoons and two shots from a high-caliber rifle to
accomplish the first successful whale hunt by the Makah since the
1920s. The seas around the 30-ton animal ran red with its blood as
it died.
</P>
<P>
   Protest boats that had tried for a week to interrupt the hunt
and scare off the whales were nowhere to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   No whale hunt has been launched from the lower 48 states since
the last commerical whaling stations in California closed in the
1970s. Other hunts likely will follow from this remote reservation.
Through an agreement brokered by the United States, the Makah can
kill up to 20 whales through 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than more tribal hunts, individual families are now
expected to begin hunting. The family hunts will take training, and
the gray whales will soon end their seasonal migration this spring
and be in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three or four families are lining up to go hunting,'' said
Marcy Parker, a former member of the tribal council. ``We've got 19
(whales) to go.''
</P>
<P>
   In Neah Bay, the kill was a seminal event so filled with pride
and history that children abandonded their classrooms and adults
their jobs. For once, the eyes of the world focused on this
isolated, poverty-stricken Indian village for what its residents
had accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud. I'm proud of the group that did this,'' said Joe
Jimmicum, a Makah tribal member who waited earlier in the day to
help get the whale on the beach. ``This is one for the Makahs.''
</P>
<P>
   As news of the successful hunt spread, Indian tribes from around
the Northwest sent representatives to Neah Bay to help the tribe
celebrate the affirmation of its whaling rights set out in an 1855
treaty with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the outside world, however, the successful hunt was
a day of sadness and outrage. In Congress, friends and foes of the
tribe expressed regret, and some wondered whether it would hurt the
tribe's ability to get federal grants.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-whaling activists who battled the hunt with a collection of
boats small and large could express only anger at the kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, with speed boats, military weaponry and the draconian
assistance of the U.S. government in stifling all dissent, American
whalers managed to blast a whale out of existence in American
waters on the pretext of cultural privilege,'' said Paul Watson,
president of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society.
</P>
<P>
   At a cabin in nearby Sekui, Wash., where whaling protesters have
gathered for months, Port Angeles resident Don Munson stood outside
with his head dropped in grief while others cried and embraced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just so hard,'' Munson said softly. ``It's like a child
dying.''
</P>
<P>
   The celebration began just after 5:30 p.m., when five canoes
towed the carcass of the whale to the village's stoney beach. Four
of the canoes were from the Tulalip, Puyallup, Hoh and Quileute
tribes. The last was the Hummingbird, the Makah's whale-hunting
canoe.
</P>
<P>
   Theron Parker, harpooner, stood in the boat stripped to the
waist, holding his paddle aloft. Sea lions barked and played
nearby. About 125 cars lined the streets and hundreds more spilled
out into the nearby parking lots. Yellow crime-scene tape held back
dozens of reporters and photographers.
</P>
<P>
   Some tribal members in the canoes began to jump for joy into the
cold waters of the bay. Others climbed atop the whale where they
stood with arms raised.
</P>
<P>
   Whaler Darrell Markishtum raised his fist to the sky and
shouted. Makah youngsters waded into the water next to the carcass
and gingerly touched the enormous beast. Some pounded the animal
with closed fists.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal chairman Ben Johnson Jr. told the cheering crowd, ``We've
faced a lot of hostilites. We held our heads high. And now we can
go and do it all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker walked slowly from the water, wearing a ceremonial
cedarbark headgear with eagle down sprinkled on his head.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Parker spoke to reporters: ``We prepared for
about a year. We prayed to our creator.'' Monday was ``a pretty
proud day for all the Makah nation.''
</P>
<P>
   He made his way to a car in which tribal elder John Hottowe, 76,
sat.
</P>
<P>
   Hottowe clutched a shaman's rattle and said of Parker: ``He was
just starting out and did not understand the spiritual ways. He was
really very vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   At 7 p.m., the Makah pulled the whale onto the beach. Parker
followed tradition, getting the first and choicest cut of the
dorsal hump. He will dry the meat, decorate it and hang it in a
place of honor in his home.
</P>
<P>
   The next cuts went to members of the whaling crew, then the rest
of the tribe.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal members chanted ``hey yah, hey yah'' to the rhythmic
beats of elk-hide drums.
</P>
<P>
   Crew members made vertical cuts along the flank of the beached
whale. Some men had small pieces of skin and blubber in their
fingers and were chewing on the flesh. Others held the drums,
painted with totem symbols, aloft, and beat them while the skin,
blubber and meat were distributed to tribal members who encircled
the whale.
</P>
<P>
   Two teenage boys sampled the meat. One said ``this tastes
terrible.'' The other replied: ``Just stick it in your mouth and
chew it.''
</P>
<P>
   As men sweated and smoked cigarettes, they quickly cut big
chunks of steaming meat off the carcass. Chunks of blubber were
passed around the crowd and many people took tentative chews of the
rubbery fat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chewy'' said one man, who described the taste as slightly
nutty.
</P>
<P>
   A number of people spit their chewy samples onto the sand.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the whale will be saved for a potlach dinner that the
tribe plans to hold later this week for tribes around the
Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Preparation for Monday's hunt began with prayers Sunday night
for better fortune.
</P>
<P>
   On May 10 and again Saturday, tribal hunters stalked the whales,
but failed to land one.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, tribal crews intended to kill a whale as they
migrated from Alaska to Mexico, but bad weather kept the crews on
shore.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe has been talking about and preparing to kill a whale
since at least 1994, when the growing number of gray whales
prompted the U.S. government to remove them from the endangered
species list.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, tribal members held a prayer circle. Tribal member
Spencer McCarty prayed for each member of the whaling crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night,'' said tribal member Joe McGimpsey, ``we had
prayers and passed around a harpoon from my
great-great-grandfather.''
</P>
<P>
   The portents were good. Andy Williams, a member of the Tulalip
Tribe in Neah Bay to offer support to the Makah, dreamed that a
whale would be taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a big celebration _ many songs and dances,'' Williams
said. ``The spirit of the water is still alive.''
</P>
<P>
   The crew aboard the Hummingbird, the black and red whaling
canoe, paddled out into the Pacific early yesterday morning. At
other times, a motorized support boat towed the canoe into the
ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The early morning seas were flat, protected by an easterly wind
by the high mountains over Cape Flattery and down the coast.
</P>
<P>
   At 6:54 a.m., the Hummingbird's bow was just above a whale.
Parker drove his harpoon into the animal as it swam beneath him.
The animal swam under the canoe as it pulled out line and brightly
colored buoys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It couldn't have been any better. It was just like we prayed
for,'' said Eric Johnson, a former whaling captain following the
canoe in a motor boat.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in the canoe seemed surprised that the harpoon entered
so easily, Johnson said. The whale passed under the canoe, and with
a toss of its tail could have tossed the paddlers into the ocean.
But it didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Johnson in the support boat fired a high-caliber rifle at
the animal repeatedly. The first two shots missed, the second two
hit their mark.
</P>
<P>
   A government biologist said one bullet hit the whale's brain,
the other shattered its skull. The whale was a 3-year-old,
non-lactating female, meaning it did not have a calf.
</P>
<P>
   The animal thrashed, exposing its belly in the gray morning
light. The quiet and blood came next.
</P>
<P>
   In the support boats, tribal members cheered and exchanged high
fives.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the support boats, Arnie Hunter, a former Marine, a
traditional chief of Neah Bay and a whaling commission member,
raised his arms and smiled. His face showed elation and relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was flooded with energy,'' Hunter said. ``This is bringing
the tribe back in a complete circle. It's the missing link in our
heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   The crew in the canoe was quiet for a moment. Soon, they began
to cheer and hug. They broke out into their whaling song, which one
tribal member said sounded like the barks of sea lions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was easy,'' said Markishtum, a member of the Hummingbird
crew, said from the decks of the Heidi, a fishing boat that towed
the whale back to Neah Bay. ``The whale gave up his life freely. He
didn't fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Others repeated those sentiments in town. Tradition holds that
Makah pray that the whale would give itself up to the hunter.
</P>
<P>
   That is what Joddie Johnson, owner of the Makah Maiden cafe, saw
as she and others watched the hunt wide-eyed and solemn from a
restaurant television.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could have flipped that tail and overturned that canoe. The
whale just gave himself up,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   On the ocean, tribal members had to fight winds and currents,
trying to pull on lines to keep the huge animal from sinking.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   NEAH BAY, Wash.: from sinking
</P>
<P>
   Donnie Swan was supposed to dive in the water and sew the
animal's mouth shut. But he lacked the proper equipment to use his
air tanks.
</P>
<P>
   So he jumped into the frigid water wearing only a wet suit and
mask.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went down and grabbed with both hands. I pulled my whole
body to the tail. I hugged it to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Swan managed to tie a bowline knot around the whale's tail. The
Heidi used the line attached to the whale's tail to tow the animal
to Neah Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The only protest boat to appear was the Sea Shepherd
Conservation Society's Sirenian, but 40 minutes late. As whaling
crew members hugged each other in relief that the stressful first
hunt was over, the mood on the Sirenian was somber. The vessel
sounded a loud mournful horn for almost 40 minutes in the distance
for the dead whale.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys got your whale, you should be happy,'' Sea Shepherd's
Watson broadcast disdainfully over the ship-to-ship radio. Late
Monday night, as his ship left Neah Bay, Watson heckled and mocked
the Makah, calling them ``Baby killers. Big, brave Makah warriors
killed a baby whale.''
</P>
<P>
   In the village, people emerged from their homes early Monday
morning, talking in small groups. Soon, car horns started honking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so excited, I can't event tell you,'' said Helma Ward, a
tribal elder. ``I can't even sit still.''
</P>
<P>
   Ourside the Makah Maiden, McGimpsey praised his forefathers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our ancient ancestors have answered our prayers. They are the
ones that secured our right to whale. They knew that someday we
would return to this whale. Our ancestors, they are magic.''
</P>
<P>
   By 8:30 a.m., tribal members began to gather in the old
community hall. Tribal Chairman Johnson announced to cheers that
the hunt had been successful.
</P>
<P>
   Then Hottowe, the tribal elder, led the tribe in a prayer song.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are an awful lot of happy Indians around here,'' one
tribal member said as he left the community hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have a good feast,'' said another.
</P>
<P>
   At the local school, teachers were present but not students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children today will look back and say, `I remember the day
they brought a whale back to the beach,' '' said Steve Jimmicum.
</P>
<P>
   J.C. Akin, who volunteers as a cook at the VFW Hall, brought her
TV set from home to follow the hunt. She was glued to the screen
for the live coverage, tears in her eyes, clasping her sleeping
grandson in her arms. ``I was so afraid down in my heart that
something would happen. My whole body was just shaking'' after
their success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even feel this way when I got married,'' Akin said.
``Oh, this is so beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   The day wasn't joyous for all Makah. Elder Alberta Thompson, who
had publicly opposed the hunt, shed tears for the whale at her
home.
</P>
<P>
   She said she hoped the kill had made a difference. ``I couldn't
look into its eyes and not feel anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the reservation, the news of a successful hunt was
frequently greeted with alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Even an ally of the Makah in Congress expressed regret. U.S.
Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash., believes tribal members have a ``public
relations disaster on their hands,'' spokesman George Behan said.
</P>
<P>
   Dicks, whose district includes Neah Bay, is the ranking Democrat
on a House subcommittee that handles appropriatations from the
Bureau of Indian Affairs and other agencies of the Interior
Department. Behan said Makah whaling could hurt the tribe's ability
to get discretionary BIA funds for such projects as economic
development.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., was ``outraged and saddened''
by the hunt, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton chairs a Senate subcommittee on Interior Department
appropriations.
</P>
<P>
   From his district office in Everett, U.S. Rep. Jack Metcalf,
R-Wash., pledged to continue to pursue a lawsuit to stop the
``barbaric'' hunts.
</P>
<P>
   Metcalf said in an interview that he worries that the Makah hunt
will spark resumed whaling by Indian groups on the west side of
Vancouver Island and by Japanese and Norwegian crews.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is needless. This is not about whaling or culture or
anything else. This is about the opportunity to open commercial
whaling worldwide,'' Metcalf said.
</P>
<P>
   The government of British Columbia vowed to block its tribes
from conducting similar whale hunts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not sign any agreement nor entertain any discussion
about going back to the past and allowing any whale hunt in British
Columbia by aboriginal peoples,'' Premier Glen Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the International Whaling Commission began two weeks
of meetings in the Caribbean island of Grenada.
</P>
<P>
   Makah whaling is not on the agenda nor has any nation asked to
discuss it, a spokesman for the National Marine Fisheries Service
said. The U.S. is expected to give a report on the tribe's whaling.
</P>
<P>
   To the Makahs, what happens in Grenada seemed unimportant
Monday. They had their whale. They had linked with an age-old
tradition that no harsh words could break.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, still his protective clothing from his day whaling,
didn't seem to mind the protesters zig-zagging in the harbor in
small inflatable boats. Soon, the Coast Guard ordered them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't bother us now,'' he said as a Coast Guard
helicopter hovered overhead. ``It's all over.''
</P>
<P>
   P-I reporters Elaine Porterfield and Rebecca Denn contributed to
this report.

regardless of debating points won or lost, and no amount of
persuasion makes much difference. But one thing that does make a
difference is cash. For most people the ultimate measure of success
is money, and by that standard religion is gaining on science. The

POWER PLAY CHANGES, BUT RESULTS DON'T
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
ST. LOUIS _ The Blues had a new look on the power play last night.
<TEXT>
<P>
   St. Louis employed an umbrella power play, keeping three players
close to the blue line. The idea was to generate more and better
chances for players who have duck-and-take-cover slap shots, such
as defenseman Al MacInnis.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   MacInnis scored on just such a shot from just such a spot at
6:51 in the second period. But it wasn't a power-play goal.
</P>
<P>
   Time had just expired on Joe Nieuwendyk's hooking penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our power play was a little disappointing,'' MacInnis said.
``We hoped to capitalize a little more.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes to the power play were in response to the Blues'
struggles with a man advantage in the series. They were 2-for-25
coming into last night's game, and MacInnis had yet to score
against the Stars. He had three goals and eight assists in the
Blues' first-round series against the Phoenix Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was frustrating,'' MacInnis said. ``You hate to think about
personal things in the playoffs, but it was frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blues finished the series 2-for-28 on the power play. Injury
woes St. Louis youngster Lubos Bartecko was back in the lineup for
Game 6 last night.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a good thing for the Blues.
</P>
<P>
   Bartecko replaced Scott Pellerin, who aggravated a groin injury
he suffered in the Blues' first-round series against Phoenix.
Pellerin missed the first two games against the Stars before
returning for Game 3. He had played in the past three games but
wasn't really effective.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues' other injury of the night was defenseman Ricard
Persson. He was helped off the ice with nine minutes remaining in
regulation last night with back spasms and didn't return. Blues
finally first It took them 26 minutes, 51 seconds, but the Blues
were finally first.
</P>
<P>
   When St. Louis defenseman Al MacInnis scored 6:51 into the
second period last night, it marked the first time in this series
that the Stars didn't score the first goal.
</P>
<P>
   It was also the first time in this series that the Blues didn't
allow the Stars to score in the first period. In the first five
games, the Stars had a goal in the first 7:50. Traffic's new name:
Handzus St. Louis said it had to get more traffic in front of Stars
goalie Ed Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic now has a name: Michal Handzus.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues' center seemed to skate right to the front of the net
every time he stepped on the ice. Handzus took his fair share of
punishment, too. The Blues had a power play five minutes into the
second period. He stepped in front of Belfour, trying to poke in a
rebound of a Geoff Courtnall shot.
</P>
<P>
   Handzus didn't succeed, but he did get a face full of the glove
of Stars defenseman Richard Matvichuk. Belfour impresses Fuhr Blues
goalie Grant Fuhr has 92 postseason victories, ranking him second
among NHL goalies behind Colorado goalie Patrick Roy (106).
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Fuhr was the one marveling at the way his Stars counterpart
has played in this series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie's played great,'' Fuhr said about Ed Belfour in
yesterday's ``St. Louis Post-Dispatch''. ``It's the best I've seen
him play. He's really stepped up. They get a small lead and sit on
it, and if he doesn't play well, they don't sit very well.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been solid every game. You can't ask for more than that.
I think he's been their best player.''

PLANTE STARTS TO GROW ON STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Mike Heika and Simon Gonzalez 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Derek Plante was buried deep in coach Ken
Hitchcock's doghouse after getting beat on Pavol Demitra's
game-winning goal in overtime of Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   Plante, acquired at the trading deadline to inject quickness
into the lineup, was slowed by being a healthy scratch for Games 4
and 5.
</P>
<P>
   But he got another chance last night when Hitchcock elected to
play him instead of rookie forwards Blake Sloan and Jonathan Sim.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much speed out there, we had to go that way,''
Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   Plante made the most of the opportunity, tying the score with a
goal 13:58 into the third period and giving the Stars a chance to
win in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt good just to go back in,'' Plante said.
</P>
<P>
   He scored his first goal in six postseason games after taking a
feed from Brett Hull in front of the Blues' goal. It wasn't a hard
shot, but Blues goalie Grant Fuhr was screened by Al MacInnis and
Stars forward Mike Keane, and never saw the puck slide just inside
the post.
</P>
<P>
   `I tried to throw it at the net,'' Plante said. ``It wasn't a
pretty goal by any stretch of the imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the game-tying goal, Plante might not be completely out
of that doghouse. He didn't exactly earn lavish praise from his
coach after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plante was OK at times,'' Hitchcock said. ``It was one game.
We'll see.''
Line shuffle Stars coach Ken Hitchcock shuffled his lines for much
of last night, trying to use a little of the old and a little of
the new. He played Mike Modano on a line with Grant Marshall, but
also used him on a line with Brett Hull. He used Jamie
Langenbrunner with Joe Nieuwendyk and also on a line with Guy
Carbonneau. And he used Mike Keane with Modano and also on a line
with Derek Plante.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be ready to change,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock's biggest change among the forward lines was Plante.
He played in place of rookies Blake Sloan and Jon Sim, who were
healthy scratches.
Arena dilemma Reunion Arena is scheduled to be the site of the
Champions on Ice figure skating show on Sunday afternoon. As a
result, the Stars aren't sure which day they will begin their next
series.
</P>
<P>
   Stars president Jim Lites said the Stars will have to wait until
the NHL decides.
Second-period blues The Stars won in six games even though they
were dominated in the second period all series.
</P>
<P>
   After Blues defenseman Al MacInnis scored the only goal in the
second last night, the Stars were outscored in the period overall,
8-4, and outshot, 67-45.
</P>
<P>
   Stars defenseman Craig Ludwig said it was mostly a matter of the
Blues having more to play for in the period. They trailed after the
first period four times in the series and were tied twice,
including last night when they faced elimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had nothing to lose,'' Ludwig said. ``They had to play
hard.''

STARS RELIEVED SERIES IS OVER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
ST. LOUIS _ A team is supposed to show certain emotions after
winning a series to advance in the playoffs. Joy is called for.
Elation. Happiness.
<TEXT>
<P>
   After the Stars knocked off the St. Louis Blues, 2-1, in
overtime last night at Kiel Center to win the Western Conference
semifinal series in six games, such things were buried beneath the
surface.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the overwhelming feeling was something different.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of relief,'' said Stars center Mike Modano,
who scored the game-winning goal.
</P>
<P>
   Relief that they remain alive in their quest for the Stanley
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Relief that they avoided the crapshoot of a Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   Relief that they've seen the last of these pesky, fast-skating,
hard-hitting Blues.
</P>
<P>
   And relief that they get some time off before taking on Colorado
or Detroit in the conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   No Stars player wanted to play the Blues with the series tied,
even though the next game would have been at Reunion Arena, where
they are 5-0 in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Game 7 anything can happen,'' said Stars forward Brett
Hull, who assisted on both goals. ``A bad bounce, and it could all
be over.''
</P>
<P>
   They played the Edmonton Oilers in a Game 7 at home two years
ago, and lost in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go to Game 7, and you just never know,'' defenseman Craig
Ludwig said.
</P>
<P>
   Especially against a team as talented as the Blues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that their hockey club has the best group of forwards
I've ever coached against since I've been in the league,'' Stars
coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``Their skill and their tenacity is as
good as any group of 12 we've played against. They were relentless
in everything they did. It was a chore every game just to clear the
zone. It was just going to get worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock also wanted to avoid a seventh game because some of
his players are running on empty. He wanted as much time as
possible to let bumps and bruises heal and tired legs get
re-energized.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got four guys who will not skate until Saturday,'' said
Hitchcock, while declining to identify the four. ``We're in tough
shape. We've got some guys who need some time off.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Reunion Arena is booked Sunday for an ice show, the next
series might not start until Monday if the Red Wings and Avalanche
go seven games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to get it over with, have as long a break as we
could,'' Modano said. ``There was really a push for us to get the
break.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars not only have the break, but they get to sit back and
wait for the next opponent. The Avalanche lead the Red Wings, 3-2,
with Game 6 scheduled for tonight in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Stars mouthed the standard,
``we-don't-care-who-we-play-next'' line, but not Modano. He wants a
chance for revenge against a Red Wings team that eliminated the
Stars in the conference finals last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone would love another crack at Detroit,'' he
said. ``That's what a lot of guys feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, what a lot of guys feel _ other than relief _ is the
need for rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``No comment,'' said Stars captain Derian Hatcher when asked his
preference for the next round. ``I just want to see it go seven
games.''

RANGERS HUNT HELP AFTER BURKETT POUNDED BY RAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Right-hander John Burkett's days as a member
of the Rangers' rotation could be over.
</P>
<P>
   Last night's performance likely served as the proverbial straw
that broke the camel's back.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett established the Rangers' single-game record by
surrendering 12 earned runs _ also the most allowed this season by
a major-league pitcher _ during an embarrassing 13-3 defeat to the
Tampa Bay Devil Rays at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's understandable that we can't keep going on like
this,'' said Rangers manager Johnny Oates, who met with general
manager Doug Melvin after last night's game to discuss
alternatives. ``We can't keep digging holes like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't keep going to the bullpen. We can't keep playing
catch-up. We can't keep trying just to finish ballgames. The status
quo is not getting it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Burkett (0-3) allowed eight hits _ which included first- and
fourth-inning home runs by catcher John Flaherty and a
bases-clearing, second-inning blast by designated hitter Jose
Canseco _ in his too-painful-to-watch, four-inning appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen of 25 batters reached safely, including five by walks,
as Burkett's earned-run average soared from 9.00 to 13.24 through
five starts spanning only 17 innings this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I'm late getting in here,'' Oates said of his
postgame meeting with Melvin. ``You always want to have
alternatives, but you want to give every opportunity for things to
work out. Doug and I have already visited tonight. We shared some
ideas and opinions. I'll sleep on them. He'll sleep on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Burkett appeared resigned to his fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys have had plenty of patience with me,'' Burkett
said. ``Whatever happens, happens. I have no opinion on that.
Obviously, I want to stay and work things out, but that's
ultimately their decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not giving up by any means. I'm just going to keep coming
in and doing my work. I prepared as well as I ever have during the
off-season, but it hasn't paid off.''
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Ryan Glynn, whom the Rangers called up Sunday from
Triple-A Oklahoma, replaced Burkett and surrendered one run on four
hits and one walk during his 2 1/3-inning appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays scored their lone run off Glynn when first
baseman Fred McGriff deposited a 2-1 pitch over the center-field
fence during the sixth inning. Glynn, who went 3-1 with a Pacific
Coast League-leading 1.85 ERA during six starts for the RedHawks,
likely will replace Burkett in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett, who went on the disabled list April 22 with bursitis in
his right shoulder, said his health was not a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fine,'' he said. ``I went into the game feeling fine, but
it was like batting practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents are hitting .422 (35-for-83) against the 34-year-old
veteran.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing out there that resembled me as a pitcher in
my past,'' Burkett said. ``It was just horrible. I didn't do
anything right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything I threw that got any of the plate at all, they
whacked it. I really don't know what to say. I stunk it up. I've
got nobody to blame right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers do, and it appears Burkett will be the first to pay
the price.

player having sent him sprawling far away from where he needed to
be.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty, maybe 75 seconds, had passed in overtime and that's where
Stars goalie Ed Belfour found himself _ flat on his face and
looking on helplessly as St. Louis defenseman Chris Pronger
prepared to fire into an empty Stars goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a great chance to score,'' St. Louis coach Joel
Quenneville said. ``They didn't have a goalie in net.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Belfour surprised Quenneville and Co., by springing to his
skates, scrambling back and staring Pronger down as if to dare him.
</P>
<P>
   Pronger took that dare, and Belfour squeezed the
watch-out-here-I-come slap shot between his pads. It was his 28th
and last save of the night.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't need another as Mike Modano scored not too long after
for a 2-1 victory in Game 6 that propelled the Stars into the next
round. Modano's goal at 2:21 in overtime will be called the
game-winner. Belfour's play was the game saver.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game changed so many times,'' Quenneville said. ``That
certainly was one.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Pronger: ``He certainly came up with big stops when they
needed him. He held them in games. They were pretty close games. He
was probably the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The fashionable question coming into the NHL playoffs was
whether Belfour was good enough to carry the Stars to the Stanley
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Blues are best able to answer that.
</P>
<P>
   They felt they had outplayed the Stars for good stretches of
this best-of-seven Western Conference semifinal series. They felt
the difference between winning and losing was as simple as Ed
Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made the big saves when he had to,'' Blues center Craig
Conroy said. ``He's a great goalie. No one ever said he wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The doubters were there, though.
</P>
<P>
   Would Belfour snap as he did against Detroit last season?
</P>
<P>
   Was Belfour capable of carrying his team?
</P>
<P>
   Could Belfour win the big game?
</P>
<P>
   He did all of this and more against the Blues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like every other night, he was their best player,'' Blues
defenseman Al MacInnis said after Game 6. ``He came up with the big
saves when they needed them. You can't take anything away from him.
He's an experienced goalie down there.''
</P>
<P>
   The fears that maybe he wouldn't be able to handle the pressure
were unfounded. When Blues winger Terry Yake poked at him early in
the first period, he turned around and said something and then he
quickly turned back.
</P>
<P>
   He played on the edge, but he never came close to stepping over
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goalie is having fun and for me to say that about Ed
Belfour ...'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said, letting his voice
trail off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard him whistle today, just whistling. That is
unbelievable,'' Hitchcock said. ``To me, Ed Belfour was the
difference in the series. Blues goalie Grant Fuhr was good. Ed
Belfour was great.''

Hull, Modano carry Stars past Blues 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
ST. LOUIS _ Give an assist to Pantera and two to Brett Hull. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   And give the Stars another trip to the Western Conference
finals. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hull went in with a wrecking ball last night and tore down the
house that he built as his gritty play led to Mike Modano's tap-in
goal at 2:21 of overtime, giving the Stars a 2-1 Game 6 victory
against the St. Louis Blues at Kiel Center. The Stars won the
series, 4-2, and advance to play the Detroit-Colorado winner.
Colorado leads the series 3-2. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But just as important as Hull finally shedding the ghosts of his
St. Louis past _ he starred here 11 years and was the impetus for
the construction of the new arena five years ago _ was a late
arrival from the rock band Pantera. After a request by Stars
defenseman Craig Ludwig, Pantera drummer Vinny Paul sent a compact
disc of the band's ``Dallas Stars Theme'' via airmail that arrived
just as regulation was ending. Before the overtime, the Stars
cranked up the theme, which is played before Stars home games, and
then rushed out to win their first game at Kiel Center in their
past seven tries. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Things haven't gone well for us in this building,'' Ludwig
said of the Stars' 0-5-1 winless streak in St. Louis. ``So I called
him \RMonday\S morning, and he got it on a plane and got it in
here. He's 6-0 with that tune there.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have won all five of their home games in the playoffs,
but players said it was important not to push their home luck in a
Game 7. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen before that anything can happen in Game 7,'' said
Modano, who scored his first playoff overtime winner at any level.
``We didn't want to take that chance.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For a long stretch, it appeared the Blues were going to get that
chance. After coming back from a three-games-to-one deficit in the
first round against Phoenix and winning Game 7 of that series on
the road in overtime, the Blues held a 1-0 lead deep into the third
period. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Had the Blues been able to win their fourth elimination game of
the playoffs and wrest the momentum of the series, there's no
telling what thoughts would have been circling in the Stars' minds.
The last time they had to play a Game 7 at home, they lost in
overtime to Edmonton two seasons ago. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys should know by now, we don't ever do anything easy,''
Ludwig said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But they do find a way to win. And out of the blue, the Stars
came back. Unlikely hero Derek Plante, who was benched for two
games after his defensive miscue led to the game-winning goal by
Blues winger Pavol Demitra in Game 3, was back in the lineup and
came up with his first point of the playoffs. After Hull worked
hard to dig a puck off the boards, Plante whipped a low shot
through a Mike Keane screen and past a befuddled Grant Fuhr to tie
the game with 6:02 remaining in the third period. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fuhr had been knocked down by teammate Al MacInnis and appeared
as if he couldn't find his bearings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of lucky, I wasn't aiming for the corner or
anything,'' Plante said. ``I'm just glad it went in.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Plante's goal made another stellar night by Stars goalie Ed
Belfour mean something, and Belfour shut down the Blues the rest of
the way. His biggest stop came in overtime when he was knocked down
by Pierre Turgeon and was able to get back up quick enough to
smother a Chris Pronger shot. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He was huge,'' Keane said. ``But he was that way the whole
series.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just a minute after the save on Pronger, the Stars were turning
a puck over off a Craig Conroy attempt at a dump-in and making a
line change going into the offensive zone. Hull worked another puck
off the boards and sort of pushed it into the crease. There, Modano
chopped it past Fuhr to end the series. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just relieved,'' Modano said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't the only one. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured if we lost in overtime, Eddie would come in and tear
up the CD player and that CD,'' Keane said. ``I guess we can keep
it now.'' &QL;

   NEAH BAY, Wash.: from sinking
</P>
<P>
   Donnie Swan was supposed to dive in the water and sew the
animal's mouth shut. But he lacked the proper equipment to use his
air tanks.
</P>
<P>
   So he jumped into the frigid water wearing only a wet suit and
mask.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went down and grabbed with both hands. I pulled my whole
body to the tail. I hugged it to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Swan managed to tie a bowline knot around the whale's tail. The
Heidi used the line attached to the whale's tail to tow the animal
to Neah Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The only protest boat to appear was the Sea Shepherd
Conservation Society's Sirenian, but 40 minutes late. As whaling
crew members hugged each other in relief that the stressful first
hunt was over, the mood on the Sirenian was somber. The vessel
sounded a loud mournful horn for almost 40 minutes in the distance
for the dead whale.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys got your whale, you should be happy,'' Sea Shepherd's
Watson broadcast disdainfully over the ship-to-ship radio. Late
Monday night, as his ship left Neah Bay, Watson heckled and mocked
the Makah, calling them ``Baby killers. Big, brave Makah warriors
killed a baby whale.''
</P>
<P>
   In the village, people emerged from their homes early Monday
morning, talking in small groups. Soon, car horns started honking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so excited, I can't event tell you,'' said Helma Ward, a
tribal elder. ``I can't even sit still.''
</P>
<P>
   Ourside the Makah Maiden, McGimpsey praised his forefathers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our ancient ancestors have answered our prayers. They are the
ones that secured our right to whale. They knew that someday we
would return to this whale. Our ancestors, they are magic.''
</P>
<P>
   By 8:30 a.m., tribal members began to gather in the old
community hall. Tribal Chairman Johnson announced to cheers that
the hunt had been successful.
</P>
<P>
   Then Hottowe, the tribal elder, led the tribe in a prayer song.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are an awful lot of happy Indians around here,'' one
tribal member said as he left the community hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have a good feast,'' said another.
</P>
<P>
   At the local school, teachers were present but not students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children today will look back and say, `I remember the day
they brought a whale back to the beach,' '' said Steve Jimmicum.
</P>
<P>
   J.C. Akin, who volunteers as a cook at the VFW Hall, brought her
TV set from home to follow the hunt. She was glued to the screen
for the live coverage, tears in her eyes, clasping her sleeping
grandson in her arms. ``I was so afraid down in my heart that
something would happen. My whole body was just shaking'' after
their success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even feel this way when I got married,'' Akin said.
``Oh, this is so beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   The day wasn't joyous for all Makah. Elder Alberta Thompson, who
had publicly opposed the hunt, shed tears for the whale at her
home.
</P>
<P>
   She said she hoped the kill had made a difference. ``I couldn't
look into its eyes and not feel anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the reservation, the news of a successful hunt was
frequently greeted with alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Even an ally of the Makah in Congress expressed regret. U.S.
Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash., believes tribal members have a ``public
relations disaster on their hands,'' spokesman George Behan said.
</P>
<P>
   Dicks, whose district includes Neah Bay, is the ranking Democrat
on a House subcommittee that handles appropriatations from the
Bureau of Indian Affairs and other agencies of the Interior
Department. Behan said Makah whaling could hurt the tribe's ability
to get discretionary BIA funds for such projects as economic
development.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., was ``outraged and saddened''
by the hunt, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton chairs a Senate subcommittee on Interior Department
appropriations.
</P>
<P>
   From his district office in Everett, U.S. Rep. Jack Metcalf,
R-Wash., pledged to continue to pursue a lawsuit to stop the
``barbaric'' hunts.
</P>
<P>
   Metcalf said in an interview that he worries that the Makah hunt
will spark resumed whaling by Indian groups on the west side of
Vancouver Island and by Japanese and Norwegian crews.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is needless. This is not about whaling or culture or
anything else. This is about the opportunity to open commercial
whaling worldwide,'' Metcalf said.
</P>
<P>
   The government of British Columbia vowed to block its tribes
from conducting similar whale hunts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not sign any agreement nor entertain any discussion
about going back to the past and allowing any whale hunt in British
Columbia by aboriginal peoples,'' Premier Glen Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the International Whaling Commission began two weeks
of meetings in the Caribbean island of Grenada.
</P>
<P>
   Makah whaling is not on the agenda nor has any nation asked to
discuss it, a spokesman for the National Marine Fisheries Service
said. The U.S. is expected to give a report on the tribe's whaling.
</P>
<P>
   To the Makahs, what happens in Grenada seemed unimportant
Monday. They had their whale. They had linked with an age-old
tradition that no harsh words could break.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, still his protective clothing from his day whaling,
didn't seem to mind the protesters zig-zagging in the harbor in
small inflatable boats. Soon, the Coast Guard ordered them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't bother us now,'' he said as a Coast Guard
helicopter hovered overhead. ``It's all over.''
</P>
<P>
   P-I reporters Elaine Porterfield and Rebecca Denn contributed to
this report.

WITH ONE THRUST OF HARPOON, MAKAH INDIANS RETURN TO WHALING ROOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT SUNDE, PAUL SHUKOVSKY AND MICHAEL BARBER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEAH BAY _ For the first time in the memory of all but the
oldest Makah, tribal canoes pulled a gray whale into this Indian
village on Monday after the first successful hunt of the huge
animals in generations.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of tribal members _ from elders bent with age to babies
in their fathers' arms _ lined the beach in a greeting that was
both solemn and chaotic. Prayers were spoken. One Indian did a back
flip off the 30-foot dead whale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today the Makah have brought the whale home,'' tribal elder
George Bowechop told the crowd. ``From this day forward, we need to
stand behind our leaders... to be a living culture.''
</P>
<P>
   With grunts, tribal members hauled the animal ashore on Monday
night and began butchering it to the sound of an ancient Makah
song.
</P>
<P>
   The triumphant beaching of the animal was the day's culmination
of history-making events.
</P>
<P>
   It began in eight minutes of fury that will spark controversy
for years to come. Tribal hunters caught and killed the whale near
Father and Son Rocks in the Pacific off Olympic National Park about
7 a.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal members in a hand-hewn cedar canoe and nearby motor boats
used three harpoons and two shots from a high-caliber rifle to
accomplish the first successful whale hunt by the Makah since the
1920s. The seas around the 30-ton animal ran red with its blood as
it died.
</P>
<P>
   Protest boats that had tried for a week to interrupt the hunt
and scare off the whales were nowhere to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   No whale hunt has been launched from the lower 48 states since
the last commerical whaling stations in California closed in the
1970s. Other hunts likely will follow from this remote reservation.
Through an agreement brokered by the United States, the Makah can
kill up to 20 whales through 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than more tribal hunts, individual families are now
expected to begin hunting. The family hunts will take training, and
the gray whales will soon end their seasonal migration this spring
and be in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three or four families are lining up to go hunting,'' said
Marcy Parker, a former member of the tribal council. ``We've got 19
(whales) to go.''
</P>
<P>
   In Neah Bay, the kill was a seminal event so filled with pride
and history that children abandonded their classrooms and adults
their jobs. For once, the eyes of the world focused on this
isolated, poverty-stricken Indian village for what its residents
had accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud. I'm proud of the group that did this,'' said Joe
Jimmicum, a Makah tribal member who waited earlier in the day to
help get the whale on the beach. ``This is one for the Makahs.''
</P>
<P>
   As news of the successful hunt spread, Indian tribes from around
the Northwest sent representatives to Neah Bay to help the tribe
celebrate the affirmation of its whaling rights set out in an 1855
treaty with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the outside world, however, the successful hunt was
a day of sadness and outrage. In Congress, friends and foes of the
tribe expressed regret, and some wondered whether it would hurt the
tribe's ability to get federal grants.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-whaling activists who battled the hunt with a collection of
boats small and large could express only anger at the kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, with speed boats, military weaponry and the draconian
assistance of the U.S. government in stifling all dissent, American
whalers managed to blast a whale out of existence in American
waters on the pretext of cultural privilege,'' said Paul Watson,
president of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society.
</P>
<P>
   At a cabin in nearby Sekui, Wash., where whaling protesters have
gathered for months, Port Angeles resident Don Munson stood outside
with his head dropped in grief while others cried and embraced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just so hard,'' Munson said softly. ``It's like a child
dying.''
</P>
<P>
   The celebration began just after 5:30 p.m., when five canoes
towed the carcass of the whale to the village's stoney beach. Four
of the canoes were from the Tulalip, Puyallup, Hoh and Quileute
tribes. The last was the Hummingbird, the Makah's whale-hunting
canoe.
</P>
<P>
   Theron Parker, harpooner, stood in the boat stripped to the
waist, holding his paddle aloft. Sea lions barked and played
nearby. About 125 cars lined the streets and hundreds more spilled
out into the nearby parking lots. Yellow crime-scene tape held back
dozens of reporters and photographers.
</P>
<P>
   Some tribal members in the canoes began to jump for joy into the
cold waters of the bay. Others climbed atop the whale where they
stood with arms raised.
</P>
<P>
   Whaler Darrell Markishtum raised his fist to the sky and
shouted. Makah youngsters waded into the water next to the carcass
and gingerly touched the enormous beast. Some pounded the animal
with closed fists.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal chairman Ben Johnson Jr. told the cheering crowd, ``We've
faced a lot of hostilites. We held our heads high. And now we can
go and do it all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker walked slowly from the water, wearing a ceremonial
cedarbark headgear with eagle down sprinkled on his head.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Parker spoke to reporters: ``We prepared for
about a year. We prayed to our creator.'' Monday was ``a pretty
proud day for all the Makah nation.''
</P>
<P>
   He made his way to a car in which tribal elder John Hottowe, 76,
sat.
</P>
<P>
   Hottowe clutched a shaman's rattle and said of Parker: ``He was
just starting out and did not understand the spiritual ways. He was
really very vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   At 7 p.m., the Makah pulled the whale onto the beach. Parker
followed tradition, getting the first and choicest cut of the
dorsal hump. He will dry the meat, decorate it and hang it in a
place of honor in his home.
</P>
<P>
   The next cuts went to members of the whaling crew, then the rest
of the tribe.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal members chanted ``hey yah, hey yah'' to the rhythmic
beats of elk-hide drums.
</P>
<P>
   Crew members made vertical cuts along the flank of the beached
whale. Some men had small pieces of skin and blubber in their
fingers and were chewing on the flesh. Others held the drums,
painted with totem symbols, aloft, and beat them while the skin,
blubber and meat were distributed to tribal members who encircled
the whale.
</P>
<P>
   Two teenage boys sampled the meat. One said ``this tastes
terrible.'' The other replied: ``Just stick it in your mouth and
chew it.''
</P>
<P>
   As men sweated and smoked cigarettes, they quickly cut big
chunks of steaming meat off the carcass. Chunks of blubber were
passed around the crowd and many people took tentative chews of the
rubbery fat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chewy'' said one man, who described the taste as slightly
nutty.
</P>
<P>
   A number of people spit their chewy samples onto the sand.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the whale will be saved for a potlach dinner that the
tribe plans to hold later this week for tribes around the
Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Preparation for Monday's hunt began with prayers Sunday night
for better fortune.
</P>
<P>
   On May 10 and again Saturday, tribal hunters stalked the whales,
but failed to land one.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, tribal crews intended to kill a whale as they
migrated from Alaska to Mexico, but bad weather kept the crews on
shore.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe has been talking about and preparing to kill a whale
since at least 1994, when the growing number of gray whales
prompted the U.S. government to remove them from the endangered
species list.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, tribal members held a prayer circle. Tribal member
Spencer McCarty prayed for each member of the whaling crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night,'' said tribal member Joe McGimpsey, ``we had
prayers and passed around a harpoon from my
great-great-grandfather.''
</P>
<P>
   The portents were good. Andy Williams, a member of the Tulalip
Tribe in Neah Bay to offer support to the Makah, dreamed that a
whale would be taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a big celebration _ many songs and dances,'' Williams
said. ``The spirit of the water is still alive.''
</P>
<P>
   The crew aboard the Hummingbird, the black and red whaling
canoe, paddled out into the Pacific early yesterday morning. At
other times, a motorized support boat towed the canoe into the
ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The early morning seas were flat, protected by an easterly wind
by the high mountains over Cape Flattery and down the coast.
</P>
<P>
   At 6:54 a.m., the Hummingbird's bow was just above a whale.
Parker drove his harpoon into the animal as it swam beneath him.
The animal swam under the canoe as it pulled out line and brightly
colored buoys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It couldn't have been any better. It was just like we prayed
for,'' said Eric Johnson, a former whaling captain following the
canoe in a motor boat.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in the canoe seemed surprised that the harpoon entered
so easily, Johnson said. The whale passed under the canoe, and with
a toss of its tail could have tossed the paddlers into the ocean.
But it didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Johnson in the support boat fired a high-caliber rifle at
the animal repeatedly. The first two shots missed, the second two
hit their mark.
</P>
<P>
   A government biologist said one bullet hit the whale's brain,
the other shattered its skull. The whale was a 3-year-old,
non-lactating female, meaning it did not have a calf.
</P>
<P>
   The animal thrashed, exposing its belly in the gray morning
light. The quiet and blood came next.
</P>
<P>
   In the support boats, tribal members cheered and exchanged high
fives.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the support boats, Arnie Hunter, a former Marine, a
traditional chief of Neah Bay and a whaling commission member,
raised his arms and smiled. His face showed elation and relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was flooded with energy,'' Hunter said. ``This is bringing
the tribe back in a complete circle. It's the missing link in our
heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   The crew in the canoe was quiet for a moment. Soon, they began
to cheer and hug. They broke out into their whaling song, which one
tribal member said sounded like the barks of sea lions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was easy,'' said Markishtum, a member of the Hummingbird
crew, said from the decks of the Heidi, a fishing boat that towed
the whale back to Neah Bay. ``The whale gave up his life freely. He
didn't fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Others repeated those sentiments in town. Tradition holds that
Makah pray that the whale would give itself up to the hunter.
</P>
<P>
   That is what Joddie Johnson, owner of the Makah Maiden cafe, saw
as she and others watched the hunt wide-eyed and solemn from a
restaurant television.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could have flipped that tail and overturned that canoe. The
whale just gave himself up,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   On the ocean, tribal members had to fight winds and currents,
trying to pull on lines to keep the huge animal from sinking.
</P>

<P>
   NEAH BAY, Wash. _ With repeated thrusts from steel harpoons and
two finishing shots from a .50-caliber armor-piercing assault
rifle, the Makah Indian tribe on Monday conducted the first legal
killing of a gray whale in American waters in nearly 75 years.
</P>
<P>
   It was described, in joyful terms by tribal leaders, as part of
the proud resurrection of the Makahs' great seafaring traditions,
but the kill of the juvenile whale also enraged environmentalists
who had gathered in protest boats nearby and provoked a modern
media spectacle, with the whole event captured live by television
crews from Seattle hovering in helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the success of their mission, the eight hunters in a
32-foot cedar canoe, assisted by other Makah men in a motorized
boat, were not able to get to the whale in time to conduct the
traditional sewing up of its mouth, and thus the great mammal
filled with water and sank to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   But using a large fishing boat, tribal members managed to
refloat it several hours later and tow it ashore, with two hunters
standing atop the whale in a triumphal pose. Hundreds of Makah
gathered on a beach late Monday afternoon, near the northwestern
tip of the continental United States, for a celebratory ceremony,
and at about 8:30 on Monday night, the hunters began cutting up the
whale and handing out small pieces of meat to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The hunt was the third effort at a whale kill in the last week
by the tribe, which had gained permission from the International
Whaling Commission, official support from the Clinton
administration and a $310,000 grant from the Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   As the men circled in for the kill shortly before 7 a.m. on
Monday, many Makah gathered to watch the event on television. They
cheered as the men drove harpoons into the juvenile gray whale's
back and it rolled over. Then came the gunshots, and soon the water
turned red.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are elated,'' said Joddie) Johnson, owner of the Makah
Maiden, a diner on the main road of the reservation here, who said
she planned to sell whale meat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll make a whale of a burger,'' she said. ``This brings
meaning and purpose back to the Makah men. For 70 years, they had
what they did best taken away from them.''
</P>
<P>
   The successful kill ``restores a missing link in our heritage,''
said Arnie Hunter, vice president of the whaling commission, who
rode in the support boat Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   But environmental groups, who had massed at Neah Bay in protest
and sent a flotilla of boats out to try to disrupt the hunt in
recent days, described the event as a tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have killed an intelligent, beautiful animal _ just blown
it away with an anti-tank gun,'' said Paul Watson, leader of Sea
Shepherd International, a conservation group. ``There's nothing
honorable about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The hunt was conducted just off the Makah's tribal land, on the
remote, storm-swept tip of Washington's Olympic Peninsula, but it
was played as huge news across much of the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's unsuccessful hunt, which led to the Coast Guard's
seizure of at least three protest boats, was broadcast live for
almost 10 hours by Northwest Cable News, prompting a Seattle Times
television critic to describe it as ``this region's own CNN-style
epoch.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray whales were driven almost to extinction by global whaling
earlier this century, and the Makah stopped hunting in the 1920s.
The United States banned all whaling of the grays in 1937, as part
of what turned out to be a successful bid to protect the species:
There are now an estimated 23,000 whales in the Pacific Ocean. The
whales' status as an endangered species was lifted in 1994,
prompting the Makah's petition for new international whaling
rights. It is the only tribe whose rights to hunt the whales are
guaranteed by a federal treaty, signed in 1855.
</P>
<P>
   Gray whales can grow to 40 feet in length and weigh as much as
40 tons. The whale killed Monday was a juvenile, and appeared to be
about half that size, though no formal measurement had been taken
as of Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The emotional cultural clash sparked by the hunt was illustrated
Monday evening by separate gatherings called to mark the event.
</P>
<P>
   The Makah were jubilant, and many of them described the event in
mystical terms, a powerful reconnection with the whaling practice
that helped define their culture and is the source of numerous
legends, songs, traditions and tribal ceremonies. For centuries, it
was a principal male rite of passage, and many Makah said the
anticipation surrounding the hunt had been a huge inspiration for
young people in the 2,000-member tribe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made history today,'' said Ben Johnson, chairman of the
tribe's whaling council. ``This is a great day for the Makah
Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Protesters, who had come together in boats and on the shore at
Neah Bay, bearing signs that said ``Tradition can be altered'' and
``Stop the killing,'' held mournful observances near the village
and in downtown Seattle, nearly five hours away by car and ferry.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jack Metcalf, R-Wash., a bitter critic of the hunt, said
the killing could pave the way to an international assault on the
whales.
</P>
<P>
   ``These majestic, highly intelligent creatures deserve better
than to be brutally slaughtered as pawns in a political game
orchestrated by Japanese and Norwegian whaling interests and
supported by the Clinton-Gore administration,'' he said in a
statement Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Makah tribal leaders say they will only kill whales for
subsistence and ceremonial purposes, and said all the meat, blubber
and oil from Monday's kill would be distributed among tribal
members.
</P>
<P>
   Though they have the right under the whaling commission's
decision to kill up to 20 whales for the next five years, they said
they have no plans to try to sell whale meat or parts on the
international market, and they do not currently have permission to
do so. (Whale meat is considered a delicacy in many Asian countries
and a single gray whale can be worth up to half a million dollars.)
</P>
<P>
   The young men on the whaling team spent months last year in
training for the hunt, and tried briefly for a kill during the
whales' fall migratory season. This spring, with the whales
returning on their northward journey toward the Bering Sea, the
Makah hunters decided to go all out.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, they have paddled through the coastal fog,
passing Shi-Shi Beach and Father and Son Rock at the Olympic
National Park, as well as other stretches of wilderness beach where
carvings of whales that were made by Indian hunters centuries ago
remain.
</P>
<P>
   Twice in the past week, hunters had thrown harpoons at passing
whales, but either missed or delivered glancing blows that did no
harm. They were deterred in part by protesters, several of whom
were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   At least one was charged, paradoxically, for violating the
Marine Mammal Protection Act by disturbing the route of a migratory
whale, while others were charged with throwing smoke bombs,
shooting flares and shooting chemical fire extinguishers in the
air.

THEATER BRACES FOR PACKED PREMIERE

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- It's almost zero hour for the Pacific Winnetka
20.
</P>
<P>
   Staffing at one of the nation's largest and most successful
megaplexes has been increased 33 percent, from 150 to 200
employees. Managers have ordered five times as much popcorn, soda
syrup and candy as normal.
</P>
<P>
   They're even stocking pizzas for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   All because the most hyped, most highly anticipated movie of all
time is opening Wednesday on three screens -- including Winnetka's
two 700-seat auditoriums with 72-foot screens. And while ``Star
Wars: Episode 1 -- The Phantom Menace'' is opening at 2,950
theaters across the country, including dozens in the Valley area,
few theaters will have as much traffic as the Winnetka.
</P>
<P>
   The 5,900-seat complex, one of the flagships in the world's
heaviest moviegoing region, has been cleared to devote more than a
third of its seating capacity to the tale of young Anakin
Skywalker. That's a gesture made for only the hottest hits, and
only for a few weeks at most. In this case, sold-out shows are
expected to be the norm well into the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're expecting the best and preparing for the worst,'' said
manager John King during a quick break Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Winnetka will be showing ``Phantom Menace'' in each theater
five times a day. Already, first-day shows at 7:30, 8 and 8:30 p.m.
have sold out.
</P>
<P>
   If every ticket were sold for the first 15 showings, that would
be 10,000 customers in less than 15 hours. ``We could probably sell
out all 20 on the first weekend, but George Lucas and 20th Century
Fox aren't going for the quick kill here,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   Many employees at the theater on Monday -- usually the slowest
day of the week -- were deep in ``Star Wars'' preparation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been kind of crazy and hectic,'' said Clifton Stewart,
the theater's general supervisor, as he navigated among massive
boxes of concession supplies on the loading dock. ``There are a lot
of things we haven't done before and a lot more stock than we
normally have.''
</P>
<P>
   Added King: ``We began ordering much heavier than usual a few
weeks ago, and our storeroom is just about bursting.'' Biggest
consumers of space are cups and popcorn tubs, with 5,000 of the
latter expected to be needed this week alone.
</P>
<P>
   Concessions are the critical driver in theater profit. At the
end of the night, operators keep only half of the $8.50 ticket
price but more than 80 percent of the money collected at the snack
bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my big worries is that when people get in the theaters,
they won't want to leave (to buy snacks),'' King said. To stimulate
spending from those customers, vendors will go into auditoriums
with ``hawker trays'' to sell popcorn, bottled Coke and the most
popular candy items (Red Vines, M&AMP;Ms, Raisinettes).
</P>
<P>
   One local entertainment analyst said ``Phantom Menace''
represents a huge opportunity for theater owners to drive up
profits with creative solutions like the one-stop ticket, in-line
carts, hawker trays and new food items.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business model for theaters is very simple -- give people
something fun to do while they drink high-margin drinks and eat
high-margin popcorn,'' said Kevin Skislock of Laguna Research
Partners. ``Still, the most effective solution for `Phantom Menace'
will be good old-fashioned staffing to keep lines as short as
possible and keep customers moving as fast as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The Winnetka will not be one of the hundreds of theaters opening
for 12:01 a.m. Wednesday showings. Los Angeles-based Pacific has
made a chainwide decision to forego the late-night madness and
start showings around 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Still, King expects his staff to work long days today and
Wednesday preparing for the movie's opening. And he has told
employees to expect to work much harder than normal once the movie
starts because they'll have to clear out trash from sold-out
auditoriums, check tickets much more rigorously than normal and
deal with as many as 10 lines outside the theater at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to have questions on where to stand and when
they'll get in, so our people have to have the answers,'' King
said.

SAM THE ORGAN MAN PUTS LIFE BACK INTO KANSAS CITY BALLPARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RUTH E. IGOE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Fenway Park has Ray. Comiskey Park has Nancy.
Busch Stadium has Ernie.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Kauffman Stadium has ``Sam the Organ Man.''
</P>
<P>
   After eight years of pumped-in, pre-recorded sound, this season
the Royals have brought back a live organist as part of a $14
million stadium renovation. He's Sam Beckett, a.k.a. the Organ Man,
a preacher's son who learned to pump up Sunday flocks as a child
piano prodigy.
</P>
<P>
   Returning the live player comes after years of fan requests,
said Tonya Mangels, the Royals' marketing director.
</P>
<P>
   ``The organ involves a feeling of nostalgia,'' Mangels said.
``He's a ham, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Beckett's skills led him to such varied pursuits as a Kansas
City youth ministry to composing music and singing ``What You Want
Is What You Get'' for McDonald's television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   But baseball also is a religion of sorts for Beckett. He even
built a baseball diamond behind his Brookside house.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's ensconced in a Kauffman Stadium skybox with his
signature wink and faux tip jar featured live on the JumboTron
during the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   And the classically trained pianist is a hit with the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the organ man. It is quintessential, major league
baseball,'' said season ticket holder Chris Cole, 27. ``It really
brings the fans into the game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's great,'' commented Shannon Dooley, 26. ``Baseball.
Americana. Organ guy. You gotta have him.''
</P>
<P>
   As a lifelong baseball buff, Beckett is loving his latest gig _
not to mention that panoramic view above home plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the funnest thing I've ever done,'' said Beckett, 33.
</P>
<P>
   Beckett first learned how to work a crowd when he was 10,
playing for his father's Southside Christian Center Assembly of God
congregation in Kansas City. By that early age, he knew how to pass
between different musical styles _ from soulful hymns to classical
ones _ with just a few chord changes.
</P>
<P>
   Beckett noticed the flock's mood changed based on what he was
playing. He experimented as people filed into services. A light and
airy tune usually resulted in cheerful pew chatter. Something
somber usually meant a silent fold, with heads bowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where I got my start,'' Beckett said.
</P>
<P>
   Beckett won the coveted organist job not only because of his
skills, said Mangels, but also because he understands baseball's
varied pace and moods. He knows to play upbeat music during an
opponent's pitching change, for example, something subtle if it's
the Royals' turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be the first to admit, I'm not the best organist,'' said
Beckett, who will play the instrument during 57 out of 81 home
games this season. ``But that's not what I'm bringing to it. I'm
bringing my musical background and my love of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Beckett's instrument looks like a cross between a two-tiered
stand-up piano and an airplane's cockpit with its blinking lights,
switches and computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   As the game starts, Beckett dons a headset to hear directions
from the adjacent control room skybox, where the staff coordinates
everything from the JumboTron to the roving cameraman. As each
Royal is introduced, he plays rising chords, varying in rhythm:
Ta-DA. DA-ta-DA.
</P>
<P>
   When opposing teams are at bat, Beckett rests his hands on his
jeans. Quiet overtakes the stadium. Fans settle down.
</P>
<P>
   Between innings, Beckett pumps up the crowd with the ``Rocky''
theme song. For each Royals batter, Beckett playfully taps out
``Charge!'' or a funky strain like The Troggs' ``Wild Thing.''
During a pre-pitch lull, he might try to get the crowd clapping to
something whimsical like the ``Addams Family'' sitcom theme.
</P>
<P>
   Beckett celebrates base hits with a tipsy snippet like The
Champs' ``Tequila.'' A walk might earn Aerosmith's ``Walk This
Way.'' Great defensive plays merit organ riffs from Van Halen's
``Jump.'' After home runs, Beckett gets to share in the revelry,
blasting rock music as fireworks explode.
</P>
<P>
   But when he isn't at the stadium or working as an instructor at
Paseo High School, Beckett is composing anything from inspirational
music to classical concertos. A black grand piano sits in his
Brookside home and a studio work station, complete with
synthesizer, dominates the master bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Fans won't see Beckett at Kauffman Stadium on Tuesdays or
Sundays. On those days, organist Mark Morris fills in.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday afternoons, Beckett is likely to be mowing a baseball
diamond he built last year in a vacant lot behind his house. Soon,
neighborhood kids started playing ball on the field. Then parents
dropped by to watch. Some brought food, then barbecue grills. Now
it's a Tuesday night ritual.
</P>
<P>
   On Sundays, church still comes first. Beckett plays for his
father's services, then enjoys the day with his family.
</P>
<P>
   But, with his trademark wink, Beckett said he'll keep the
Kauffman gig ``as long as it's fun.''

HULL BURNS THE BLUES BUT NOT BRIDGES OR ARCHES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ You can go home again. But why should Brett Hull
bother now?
</P>
<P>
   It's over. Been here, and now he's done that. The divorce is
final.
</P>
<P>
   Hull wins. The Blues can keep the furniture. And the golf clubs
_ they'll need them.
</P>
<P>
   If this were a fairy tale, Hull would have spanked home his
wrap-around shot in that third minute of overtime _ instead of
teammate Mike Modano poking home the Stars' game-inning rebound _
and vindication would have been sweet.
</P>
<P>
   But vindication for what, Hull seemed to ask?
</P>
<P>
   This second-round playoff series against his old team was never
about vengeance, or absolution, or proving to the people in St.
Louis that Brett Hull wasn't the reason that they lost in the
playoffs all those years.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many great memories, and that's the only thing
I've ever taken from here,'' said Hull, who signed a $24-million
contract with the Stars in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in a situation like this, you have to put all that in the
back of your mind and just try to win a series. It was just a big
win for me, and a big win for the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Right. And all the garbage that Kiel Center fans were pelting
the ice with after the game was sweetheart roses and good-luck
chocolates.
</P>
<P>
   Hull stood there in the visitors locker room and said all the
right things. He didn't burn any bridges or arches. He even wore
the No. 14 shirt, the one with the candle in tribute to his late
St. Louis teammate Doug Wickenheiser, that he's worn under his
jersey all year.
</P>
<P>
   But let's be politically incorrect here. Blues management wanted
to wipe the slate clean after last season, and the first piece of
fat it trimmed was Hull's bulbous contract. Upsetting the Stars and
Hull in this second round of the Stanley Cup playoffs, in some
eyes, would have validated the Blues' decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``You talk about the pressure,'' Hull admitted. ``You try to
slough it off. But obviously, with me coming to Dallas and meeting
the Blues in the playoffs, this was something I obviously really
wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   On a night that meant so much to his new team, let it be
recorded that Brett Hull seized the moment. He hustled and
forechecked. He scrambled and, as he did all six games, he
commanded the Blues' attention.
</P>
<P>
   It was the new Hull, beating his old team, with his new coach's
own game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was probably the strongest game he played the whole
series,'' Modano said. ``He was really into the game and playing
hard. I'm sure he was hungry to get it over with _ and to do it in
St. Louis.''
</P>
<P>
   It was no coincidence that Hull figured in both of the Stars'
goals. He didn't score, but this is the new Hull.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first goal was just a hard-working goal,'' Hull explained.
``Out of the corner of my eye, I thought I saw a defenseman take
Grant \RFuhr\S down. As the puck came back around, I wanted to take
it out in front of the net. But there was Derek \RPlante, scoring
his first playoff goal in two years\S.''
</P>
<P>
   The winning goal was all effort. Hull, playing the role of
forechecker, drove hard down the left side and around the back of
the net, harboring visions of wrapping home the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was just wanting to get it on net,'' Modano said.
``I think he didn't see me. But they kind of left me alone, and I
was able to get a couple of whacks at it.''
</P>
<P>
   The red lamp blinked, and Hull seemed to react even before
Modano. The arena instantly turned silent.
</P>
<P>
   When they saw Hull grinning and shouting, some of the fans began
to boo. The boos were quickly drowned out by cheers for the
stubborn Blues, who forced the favored Stars into overtime for four
of the six games.
</P>
<P>
   But when it came time for the traditional end-of-series
handshakes, boos for Hull were heard again.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can boo me all they want,'' Hull said graciously, ``but I
know and remember all the great times we had together.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull was asked how it felt to finally, in a symbolic sense,
leave St. Louis in his rear-view mirror. A page was turned here
last night, someone suggested.
</P>
<P>
   But Hull refused to go along with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'll ever turn the page I had here in St.
Louis,'' he corrected. ``So many good things happened here, so many
memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may say the page is turned now, but there will always be a
bookmark at that page.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't burn any bridges last night. He just broke some
hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Say goodbye to Brett Hull, St. Louis. Surely, you could have
used him.

SEN. BOND CALLS FOR EASING CLEAN-AIR LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MANSUR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Faced with threatened delays in highway
expansions, Kansas City needs some relief from strict
interpretations of federal clean-air laws, U.S. Sen. Kit Bond said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Bond, a Republican, said he introduced legislation on Friday to
give such relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to change that law and restore the flexibility that
the EPA used to utilize to allow these projects to go forward,''
Bond said.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City, Mo., on the first day of a two-day media blitz
across Missouri, Bond joined many of the state's business and
industry leaders to condemn environmental groups' recent legal
attempts to tie up highway projects in St. Louis and Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're successful in cutting off highway funds, it won't
do anything to clean up the air,'' Bond said. ``There's nothing
worse for the quality of air than to have cars and trucks and buses
backed up for miles with their engines running.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond said the lawsuit seeks to withhold highway funds statewide
if St. Louis doesn't comply with federal clean-air requirements.
</P>
<P>
   But the environmental groups quickly fired back. First, they are
not seeking to tie up all of the state's highway funds, Sierra Club
spokeswoman Gina M. De Barthe said.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, she said, St. Louis has been out of compliance with
the federal limits since 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sen. Bond should travel around the state to advance the cause
for clean air, not advance the cause of the polluters who finance
his campaigns,'' added Pat Waterston, president of the Missouri
Coalition for the Environment.
</P>
<P>
   Bond, a member of the Senate Environment Committee, announced
the launching of a drive for signatures on a petition asking the
Sierra Club to drop its lawsuit regarding St. Louis' compliance
with federal air limits.
</P>
<P>
   To Bond, threats against widened, resurfaced and safer highways
and bridges shouldn't be held over the heads of community leaders
who won't comply with requirements of the federal Clean Air Act.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling with him were Carolyn Winkler, whose 34-year-old son
died on a two-lane road between Columbia and Moberly; Barry
Orscheln, chairman of the Missouri Chamber of Commerce; Chris Long
of the Associated Industries of Missouri; and Harriet Beard, a
member of the state's Air Conservation Commission, which is
authorized to enforce federal air regulations in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   At the press conference, Beard characterized the Sierra Club's
request for highway sanctions as ``ridiculous.'' But she
acknowledged later that the Environmental Protection Agency's
threat to withhold highway funds in the past had helped win support
in the state legislature for a new auto inspection program that
will check cars' emissions of ozone-creating chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have gotten (the inspection program) through in St.
Louis,'' Beard said. ``I would like to think that would have
happened anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the state has begun to build the new inspection stations
and is bringing less-polluting gasoline to St. Louis-area pumps
next month. ``It's in motion,'' Beard said.
</P>
<P>
   Bond said the federal agencies don't need the highway sanctions,
which can cause too great a burden on businesses that must deliver
their goods and pose too great a safety hazard if lost. ``There's
plenty of other powers to bring states and areas into compliance,''
Bond said.
</P>
<P>
   The senator and his supporters take their petition campaign
today to Cape Girardeau, Joplin and Springfield.

<P>
   NEAH BAY, Wash.: from sinking
</P>
<P>
   Donnie Swan was supposed to dive in the water and sew the
animal's mouth shut. But he lacked the proper equipment to use his
air tanks.
</P>
<P>
   So he jumped into the frigid water wearing only a wet suit and
mask.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went down and grabbed with both hands. I pulled my whole
body to the tail. I hugged it to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Swan managed to tie a bowline knot around the whale's tail. The
Heidi used the line attached to the whale's tail to tow the animal
to Neah Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The only protest boat to appear was the Sea Shepherd
Conservation Society's Sirenian, but 40 minutes late. As whaling
crew members hugged each other in relief that the stressful first
hunt was over, the mood on the Sirenian was somber. The vessel
sounded a loud mournful horn for almost 40 minutes in the distance
for the dead whale.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys got your whale, you should be happy,'' Sea Shepherd's
Watson broadcast disdainfully over the ship-to-ship radio. Late
Monday night, as his ship left Neah Bay, Watson heckled and mocked
the Makah, calling them ``Baby killers. Big, brave Makah warriors
killed a baby whale.''
</P>
<P>
   In the village, people emerged from their homes early Monday
morning, talking in small groups. Soon, car horns started honking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so excited, I can't event tell you,'' said Helma Ward, a
tribal elder. ``I can't even sit still.''
</P>
<P>
   Ourside the Makah Maiden, McGimpsey praised his forefathers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our ancient ancestors have answered our prayers. They are the
ones that secured our right to whale. They knew that someday we
would return to this whale. Our ancestors, they are magic.''
</P>
<P>
   By 8:30 a.m., tribal members began to gather in the old
community hall. Tribal Chairman Johnson announced to cheers that
the hunt had been successful.
</P>
<P>
   Then Hottowe, the tribal elder, led the tribe in a prayer song.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are an awful lot of happy Indians around here,'' one
tribal member said as he left the community hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have a good feast,'' said another.
</P>
<P>
   At the local school, teachers were present but not students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children today will look back and say, `I remember the day
they brought a whale back to the beach,' '' said Steve Jimmicum.
</P>
<P>
   J.C. Akin, who volunteers as a cook at the VFW Hall, brought her
TV set from home to follow the hunt. She was glued to the screen
for the live coverage, tears in her eyes, clasping her sleeping
grandson in her arms. ``I was so afraid down in my heart that
something would happen. My whole body was just shaking'' after
their success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even feel this way when I got married,'' Akin said.
``Oh, this is so beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   The day wasn't joyous for all Makah. Elder Alberta Thompson, who
had publicly opposed the hunt, shed tears for the whale at her
home.
</P>
<P>
   She said she hoped the kill had made a difference. ``I couldn't
look into its eyes and not feel anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the reservation, the news of a successful hunt was
frequently greeted with alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Even an ally of the Makah in Congress expressed regret. U.S.
Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash., believes tribal members have a ``public
relations disaster on their hands,'' spokesman George Behan said.
</P>
<P>
   Dicks, whose district includes Neah Bay, is the ranking Democrat
on a House subcommittee that handles appropriatations from the
Bureau of Indian Affairs and other agencies of the Interior
Department. Behan said Makah whaling could hurt the tribe's ability
to get discretionary BIA funds for such projects as economic
development.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., was ``outraged and saddened''
by the hunt, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton chairs a Senate subcommittee on Interior Department
appropriations.
</P>
<P>
   From his district office in Everett, U.S. Rep. Jack Metcalf,
R-Wash., pledged to continue to pursue a lawsuit to stop the
``barbaric'' hunts.
</P>
<P>
   Metcalf said in an interview that he worries that the Makah hunt
will spark resumed whaling by Indian groups on the west side of
Vancouver Island and by Japanese and Norwegian crews.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is needless. This is not about whaling or culture or
anything else. This is about the opportunity to open commercial
whaling worldwide,'' Metcalf said.
</P>
<P>
   The government of British Columbia vowed to block its tribes
from conducting similar whale hunts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not sign any agreement nor entertain any discussion
about going back to the past and allowing any whale hunt in British
Columbia by aboriginal peoples,'' Premier Glen Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the International Whaling Commission began two weeks
of meetings in the Caribbean island of Grenada.
</P>
<P>
   Makah whaling is not on the agenda nor has any nation asked to
discuss it, a spokesman for the National Marine Fisheries Service
said. The U.S. is expected to give a report on the tribe's whaling.
</P>
<P>
   To the Makahs, what happens in Grenada seemed unimportant
Monday. They had their whale. They had linked with an age-old
tradition that no harsh words could break.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, still his protective clothing from his day whaling,
didn't seem to mind the protesters zig-zagging in the harbor in
small inflatable boats. Soon, the Coast Guard ordered them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't bother us now,'' he said as a Coast Guard
helicopter hovered overhead. ``It's all over.''
</P>

   Post-Intelligencer reporters Elaine Porterfield and Rebekah Denn
contributed to this report.

BOYS MOVEMENT LEADER BRINGS HIS MESSAGE OF NURTURING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE HILL KAVANAUGH  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Michael Gurian shivered when he heard news
reports of an alleged plot by four boys to carry out a massacre at
their Port Huron, Mich., school. But he wasn't surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``America's adolescent males are in trouble,'' said Gurian, a
family therapist in Spokane, Wash., and a leader in the nationwide
``boys movement.'' Millions of boys aren't being nurtured the way
they should, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys are emotionally fragile, perhaps even more so than
adolescent girls,'' he said. ``But we've been ignoring them. For
the last few decades our cultural microscope has focused on the
oppression of girls and women. Now the lens must focus on boys,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Gurian, author of several books on boys, including his latest, A
Fine Young Man: What Parents, Mentors and Educators Can Do to Shape
Adolescent Boys Into Exceptional Young Men, was a keynote speaker
Monday at the national convention of the Court Appointed Special
Advocate Association. He spoke to more than 1,000 people at the
Hyatt Regency Crown Center hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Gurian's idea of nurturing boys is part of a larger movement
sweeping the nation, in part because of violence erupting in the
nation's schools _ violence committed by boys.
</P>
<P>
   Gurian says the violence is predictable but preventable.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of nurturing boys is gaining nationwide acceptance.
Beginning this fall several school districts in the Kansas City
area are going to try some of Gurian's ideas.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Gurian will teach a three-day seminar at the
University of Missouri-Kansas City, said Robert Henley, retired
superintendent of the Independence School District.
</P>
<P>
   The seminar, called the Gurian Institute, is part of the Safe
School Initiative. Five districts have signed up so far:
Independence, Hickman Mills, Grandview, St. Joseph and Kansas City,
Kan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've known for years that boys are in a higher risk group for
all sorts of problems,'' Henley said. ``But we've continued to
treat boys and girls as if they have exactly the same issues.
There's never been a real attempt to put special programs in for
boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what the answer is, but we want to learn
Michael's ideas and apply them to some actual school environments
and just see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   For 15 years Gurian has researched the idea that boys and girls
are vastly different aside from the obvious physical differences.
</P>
<P>
   Competition is hard-wired into boys, he said. So are quick
problem-solving and physical risk-taking. It's testosterone, not
attitude, that makes them aggressive, Gurian said.
</P>
<P>
   Society teaches them violence, he said, because it is not aware
of a boy's risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched a couple bring their 3-year-old son to the movie
`Saving Private Ryan,' '' he said. ``I was horrified because I knew
the damage those parents were doing to their son. So I went over
and told them. We're a society in transition and need to be aware
of how boys function. No one has ever taught us this before.''

ACCESS TO ROAD IS GAIN FOR EXERCISERS, PAIN FOR AIRPORT OFFICIALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MIKE RICE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ For in-line skaters Nicole Calton and Melissa
DiMauro, the road that circles the Downtown Airport has everything.
</P>
<P>
   It's flat. It hardly has any traffic. It has a nice view of the
downtown skyline. With all that, the 3.8-mile stretch of road has
become a hot spot for skaters, joggers, bicyclists and wheelchair
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that it was never intended to be a skating track, or
that airport officials _ citing the potential dangers _ really
don't want anyone exercising there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really the only place where you can safely Rollerblade,''
said DiMauro, a veterinary technician from Kansas City, North. ``No
one's down here.''
</P>
<P>
   The parking lot on the airport's west side, which abuts the
Missouri River, is so desolate that bicyclist John Maynard feels
comfortable about changing his clothes in his car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work at Hallmark and live in the Northland,'' he said after
work one recent afternoon, ``so this place is very convenient.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, its proximity to downtown has made the airport a popular
lunchtime exercise hangout.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives me a good hour of stress relief,'' said Ryan Pals, a
sales manager for Premium Standard Farms who has walked and jogged
on the airport road nearly every day for the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   The oval perimeter includes Richards Road, which abuts U.S. 169
and the airport's east side, and Lou Holland Drive, which serves
several hangars and businesses on the airport's west side.
</P>
<P>
   Maynard, a triathlete, rides his bicycle for about an hour and
then runs. He and his fellow bicyclists even rode there on New
Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   The road, Maynard said, is ideal for the high-speed training of
serious runners and bicyclists.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have a flat course to train,'' Maynard said.
``And, it's kind of cool to see the planes land.''
</P>
<P>
   Some would like to see organized skating and bicycling events
held there. And despite the airport's proximity to railroad tracks,
a water treatment plant and other industries, exercisers said they
rarely encounter any foul odors.
</P>
<P>
   But airport officials are not pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a dangerous situation,'' said Ed Noyallis, the airport's
general manager. ``People can be blinded by the headlights from
other cars, especially if they are going north on Richards Road at
twilight. And there's a blind corner on the south end.''
</P>
<P>
   Noyallis said he believes the exercisers en masse discovered the
airport road sometime in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The city briefly closed the road to nonmotorized traffic and
pedestrians in 1993 after a bicyclist was killed there. He slammed
into a curb and was not wearing a helmet.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, some bicyclists interfered with the repair of
the river's levee after heavy rains, Noyallis said, adding that one
bicyclist even rode through barricades.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to be ogres,'' he said, ``we're just
concerned about people's safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Meisinger, president of Executive Beechcraft Inc., which has
its office on the southeast end of the airport, said the fitness
buffs are not annoying. Vehicular traffic, he said, does not travel
at high speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Meisinger shared some of Noyallis' concerns. ``There is
bound to be an incident because they are in the street.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pals said motorists have always been nice. ``They usually
wave at us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs along Lou Holland Drive and Richards Road that
say in-line skating is prohibited. But Noyallis said the city only
enforces the rule ``on occasion,'' when someone requests it.
</P>
<P>
   Calton and DiMauro said they have never been cited. Another
skater, Brad Max, who works for a Kansas City investment firm, said
he had never had problems with airport personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are nice as long as you don't behave inappropriately and
don't block the road,'' Max said.
</P>
<P>
   Maynard disagreed with claims that the exercisers are reckless.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are safety-conscious,'' he said. ``We won't ride with
anyone who won't wear a helmet.''
</P>

   Councilwoman Teresa Loar, who heads the City Council's Aviation
Committee, said the situation shows a citywide problem _ the need
for more biking and jogging trails and skating parks.

   Scott Cozad, a physician who lives in Kansas City, North, said
the airport road is one of the few bicycle-friendly places in the
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many drivers here are inattentive and, at worst, malicious,''
said Cozad, who bikes and jogs at the airport three times a week.
``I think the people here at the airport have gotten used'' to the
exercisers.
</P>
<P>
   Although there has been no talk about banning recreational
activities from the airport road, such concern from city officials
troubles the exercisers.

KOBE IS ADVISER TO YOUNG STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Kobe Bryant is only 20 years old, but the
third-year veteran has become a mentor to underclassmen of the NCAA
and would-be teen-age NBA stars.
</P>
<P>
   Rhode Island sophomore Lamar Odom declared himself eligible for
the NBA draft on Monday but not before consulting with the Lakers'
young phenom, who decided to turn pro three years ago at the tender
age of 17.
</P>
<P>
   For Bryant, already an All-Star and a starter on one of the
NBA's best teams, the move has obviously turned out to be a good
decision. But for every Bryant, there are the Jermaine O'Neals
(Portland) and Tracy McGradys (Toronto) who struggle with the
adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   So when Bryant's hit up for advice, he offers a conservative
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different for every individual,'' he said, ``but when
they ask for your advice or what you think, you can only tell them
about certain things you experience. You can't tell them what to do
or what not to do because everyone's different. Some people, it
works out fine, some people it doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a gut feeling. At least for me it was,'' Bryant
said. ``I just knew it was the right thing. I couldn't explain why
or come up with concrete reasons. It just felt right.''
</P>
<P>
   Odom, 19, and Bryant have been friends for years, having run in
the same youth-league circles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was just looking for experiences, certain things to
look forward to, what to expect, what not to expect. A lot of the
same things I was looking for,'' Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant's a success story among early entries, but he said his
rookie season, when he barely played, was tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be a great move depending on the individual,'' he said.
``Personally, I think if I was a different person, my rookie year
would have been miserable, because I didn't play that much, I went
through a lot of ups and downs, a lot of criticism, stuff like
that. But it's how you handle it, it's how you take it.''
</P>
<P>
   So his words of wisdom to Odom were simple: ``Have fun and
learn. That's all. Be patient.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `Welcome to the league _ I'll be waiting to give
you 40.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Glamour boys: The Lakers will be victims of their own
popularity this weekend. To get them on NBC as much as possible,
the league has scheduled back-to-back Games 3 and 4, Saturday and
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's ever happened before, so I don't know if
it's good or bad,'' coach Kurt Rambis said. ``That's something
that's out of my and everybody's else's control. You just deal with
it the best you can.''

WESTERN RESOURCES, KCP&AMP;L IN FINAL STRETCHES OF A MARATHON MERGER
COURSE 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Photos of former utility regulators stared
from one wall. On the other side loomed the Great Seal of the State
of Kansas. In the middle sat three current members of the Kansas
Corporation Commission.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't an unfamiliar setting for Drue Jennings, head of
Kansas City Power &AMP; Light Co. As the veteran utility executive sat
in the hearing room's witness box two weeks ago, he deftly handled
questions about why his utility should merge with Western Resources
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings was at ease, and at times he even had the room
chuckling.
</P>
<P>
   But as the day progressed, there was no mistaking his
seriousness on one point: Jennings wanted this deal. This was his
third shot at merging KCP&AMP;L with another utility.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he was asked whether he would go through with the
merger even at Western's then-stock price of just over $27 a share.
That figure, which represented a reduction in the amount that KCP&AMP;L
stockholders would receive, would also give the utility the option
to walk away from the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, said Jennings, who last August cashed out 80 percent of his
KCP&AMP;L stock options _ 97,146 shares _ at $29.29 per share. He would
go ahead with the merger, as long as regulators didn't tinker with
the deal in a way that would reduce revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do I sign?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   If only it were that easy. More than two years have passed since
the utilities announced merger plans after a long takeover fight.
The process has dragged on so long that a federal regulator
recently complained that some information submitted with the merger
application was too old to be of use.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the end of the game may be nearing in Kansas, where
regulators are in the middle of their hearings. Missouri will begin
similar hearings in July. The biggest hurdle could be federal
regulators, who say consideration of the matter could stretch well
into next year.
</P>
<P>
   However, the utilities recently worked out a compromise with the
staff of the Kansas Corporation Commission, and they insist the
merger will be completed this year.
</P>
<P>
   Will the merged company be so large it will edge out potential
competitors? Are consumers shouldering too much of the risk and
receiving too few of the benefits in the merger?
</P>
<P>
   These are some of the questions that regulators ponder. And
growing numbers of critics vow that the fight against the merger is
not over yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This merger has become a can of worms,'' said Walker Hendrix,
counsel for the Citizens' Utility Ratepayer Board in Topeka, a
group that represents consumers on utility issues. &QL; 
 &QL; 
--- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's no small irony that the two utilities want to merge,
given the enmity they've often had for each other over the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
   KCP&AMP;L struck first in 1990, when it made an unsolicited bid for
Kansas Gas &AMP; Electric. Western snatched KGE away with its own
offer. In the mid-'90s, KCP&AMP;L rejected a merger overture from
Western.
</P>
<P>
   A truce existed until 1996, when KCP&AMP;L decided to combine with
UtiliCorp United Inc. of Kansas City. Western reacted with an
unsolicited bid for KCP&AMP;L and made it the first successful
hostile-takeover fight of an electric utility in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Egos were a factor in the contest. No one accused Jennings and
then-Western Chairman John Hayes of being buddies. But economics
and a changing utility industry were pushing them together.
</P>
<P>
   The looming prospect of deregulation and the eventual loss of a
utility's monopoly were forcing change. Electric utilities hoped to
reap the benefits of greater economies of scale. Larger companies
would have the capital to build more plants and buy power on the
wholesale market. And by lowering costs and rates, they could
retain customers.
</P>
<P>
   A merged KCP&AMP;L-Western would be the 32nd-largest utility in the
country. KCP&AMP;L and Western's KPL and KGE utilities would combine in
a company to be called Westar Energy, based in Kansas City. It
would have 1 million customers and $8.2 billion in assets.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings, 52, would be Westar's first chief executive, though he
says he hopes to retire in his mid-50s.
</P>
<P>
   The merger effort has been an enormously expensive process. By
the time they reached an agreement, the two utilities had spent
$160 million on merger expenses. For KCP&AMP;L, those expenses in the
past three years have reached $100 million, including a $53 million
payment to UtiliCorp for not completing that deal.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about his previous distaste for Western, Jennings
told regulators that Western was a different company now. For
instance, it now owned most of {Protection One}, a
monitored-security service.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's great potential there,'' he said.

L.A. HOME PRICES UP; SUPPLY SHRINKING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With an assist from confident consumers, home
prices in the San Fernando Valley soared 14.1 percent during the
12-month period ending in April, and while sales slowed slightly,
the real estate market remained robust, a trade group said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the median price _ the point at which half the homes
sold for more and half for less _ hit $211,000, a gain of $26,000
in the last 12 months. Meanwhile, escrow closed on 1,208
single-family homes, a 1.1 percent decline from April 1998, said
the Southland Regional Association of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in number of homes sold was neither a surprise nor
disturbing. After all, last month's total is the second highest
ever for an April; the highest was April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, industry officials said the only thing holding back
sales is tight product supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``Demand is still ahead of supply, even if the red-hot frenzy of
last year has cooled ever so slightly,'' said Jim Link, the
association's executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   During April, there were 24 fewer new listings recorded, a
decline of 1.3 percent, from the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
   While the current price run-up is good news for consumers, it
does not compare to what took place in the late 1980s and early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price escalation back then was actually faster than this
one. These prices are coming back strong because they are making up
for a lot of lost ground in the mid-1990s,'' Link said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the peak median price hit $245,000 three times
during 1989. The highest it got during this decade was $244,000 in
April of 1990. So the current price appreciation is replacing value
lost during the deep recession of earlier this decade, and there is
still a way to go to full recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Link said the rising prices are a reflection of a very strong
overall economy.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Sommer, the association's president, predicted this year's
market will end up looking a lot like 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to just stay a drop below the 1998 rate of sales,
and the reason we're not selling more is because we don't have
enough listings,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Bray, national marketing director at the Meyers Group, a
real estate consulting service in Santa Monica, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inventories are tight, so obviously pricing continues to go
up,'' he said of the Valley's market. ``We think it's going to be a
strong year and pretty similar to last year.''
</P>
<P>
   One result of the rising prices is increased activity in the
condominium market.
</P>
<P>
   During April, Realtors reported selling 331 units, an increase
of 13.4 percent from a year ago. The median price of $127,500
gained 18.6 percent from the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
   Nima Nattagh, an analyst at First American Real Estate Solutions
in Santa Ana, said the market continues to run on momentum that was
building last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first quarter is actually a continuation of a good market
we saw in 1998, but I suspect there will be some slowing down as we
progress throughout the year'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller Santa Clarita Valley turned in a more robust
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of existing single-family homes there totaled 264 units,
up 18.4 percent from April 1998. The median price of $225,000
gained 18.1 percent on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
   Escrow closed on 118 condominiums, up 49.4 percent from a year
ago, and the median price gained 15.3 percent to $134,900.

WESTERN RESOURCES, KCP&AMP;L IN FINAL STRETCHES OF A MARATHON MERGER
COURSE

<P>
   (``There's great potential there,'' he said. &QL; )
 &QL; 
--- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Western and KCP&AMP;L are something of a corporate odd
couple.
</P>
<P>
   KCP&AMP;L had dabbled in some deregulated businesses such as
WorryFree, which leases furnaces and air conditioners. But it's
best known among analysts for being a capable and low-cost provider
of power.
</P>
<P>
   Western, of course, has KPL and KGE, and it owns part of Oneok
Inc., a natural gas company. But it has quickly built its
deregulated business mainly by purchasing Protection One, investing
millions in it, and creating what is now the second-largest
monitored-security service.
</P>
<P>
   Even Western's leadership differs from tradition. David Wittig
was brought in to help Western acquire companies and forge its
entrepreneurial strategy. Originally from Prairie Village, Wittig
has also worked in New York, where he was an investment banker.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he is Western's chairman, president and chief executive
officer _ making him point man for promoting and explaining the
merger. That new mission brought him before the Kansas Corporation
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   As questioning from regulators lingered late into a recent
evening, Wittig tilted his head and put his hand on his cheek. As
the questions continued, he began to sigh with each answer until
his lawyer objected to the inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   One questioner asked about transmitting power from the Wolf
Creek nuclear plant in Burlington, Kan., to KPL. Couldn't be done,
Wittig said, because there were no lines from the plant to KPL.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to get it through thin air,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Jennings, Wittig wants the merger and has something to
prove.
</P>
<P>
   Wittig, who received $2.5 million in compensation from Western
last year, says that most of the pieces are in place and that he
has no plans for buying more companies. But completing the merger
with KCP&AMP;L is an important part of the company's plan to expand the
electric business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to meet the challenges of the future,'' Wittig told
regulators. &QL; 
 &QL; 
--- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For that to happen, state and federal regulators must approve
the deal. And signs of skepticism are rife.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the Kansas Corporation Commission staff expressed
concerns about the deal. But Gov. Bill Graves noted the day the
staff disclosed its concerns that he didn't want too many
restrictions to kill the merger. A couple of months later, staff
members came to an agreement with Western.
</P>
<P>
   A commission spokeswoman said that there was no pressure on the
staff and that the terms of the settlement were good. But the
compromise angered critics, who said it fell far short of
protecting consumers, and some blamed political pressure for the
turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   ``Western has mastered the political culture of Topeka,'' said
Mayor Bob Knight of Wichita. He wants more relief for KGE
customers, who pay higher rates than customers of KPL and KCP&AMP;L.
</P>
<P>
   While some criticized it, the Kansas agreement dealt with issues
that have troubled critics of the merger. Western and KCP&AMP;L wanted
to ditch traditional rate proceedings and replace them with an
incentive plan that would give Westar a 13.5 percent return on
equity and a piece of any additional profit.
</P>
<P>
   The incentive plan, critics said, would effectively stop
consumers from reaping any of the cost savings of the merger and
saddle them with paying the $870 million acquisition premium that
Western paid for KCP&AMP;L. The premium is the amount over the book
value of the company.
</P>
<P>
   The staff's agreement would give Westar $300 million of the
acquisition premium from Kansas consumers. The compromise would
allow it to keep all the merger savings in the first four years of
Westar's existence.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the incentive mechanism would be shelved and there
would be a rate moratorium for four years. In addition, there would
be $45 million in rebates over three years, spread among customers
of KPL, KGE and KCP&AMP;L. Originally, the staff recommended $27
million a year in rate relief going to KGE customers.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas Corporation Commission has yet to approve the merger,
though the agreement is expected to smooth the way. The going could
be tougher with Missouri and federal regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The staff of the {Missouri Public Service Commission} also is
critical of the incentive-rate plan that Western and KCP&AMP;L want.
And it recommends that none of the acquisition premium be collected
from ratepayers. Indeed, such a premium has never been collected
from utility customers in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   The {Missouri Office of Public Counsel}, which represents
consumers before the commission, would like to see the deal killed.
But Ryan Kind, an economist with the public counsel's office, said
Western could still come out ahead because he suspects a major
reason for the deal is that Western simply wanted to stop KCP&AMP;L
from merging with UtiliCorp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a win-win situation for Western Resources,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the federal regulators. The Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission's staff said preliminary indications were
that the merged company would have too much market power. They
called for hearings that are to begin in October, although there is
still a possibility of settlement.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of mergers before federal regulators don't go to
hearings. Instead, they are settled with an order. At a meeting
discussing the case, Shelton Cannon, director of the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission's Office of Electric Power Regulation, said
the staff had given as much guidance as possible to Western and
KCP&AMP;L, according to /{Foster Electric Report/}, a trade publication
that covered the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Were Western and KCP&AMP;L not listening, asked one of the
commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would suggest that's part of it,'' Cannon said. (END)

WESTERN RESOURCES REPORTS LOWER FIRST-QUARTER EARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Western Resources Inc. on Monday reported
lower first-quarter earnings, largely because of moderate weather
and the absence of some one-time gains posted last year.
</P>
<P>
   Continued losses in the company's Protection One subsidiary also
affected quarterly results.
</P>
<P>
   The Topeka utility company reported 1999 first-quarter net
income of $20.7 million, compared with $29.8 million for the same
period last year. Western's sales were $461 million for the first
quarter, compared with $382 million for the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings for the first three months this year were 31 cents per
share, compared with 44 cents per share for the same period last
year. But 12 cents per share of last year's earnings were from
one-time gains that included life insurance proceeds. Before
accounting for the one-time gains, Western earned 32 cents per
share in the first quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Profit from Western's electric utilities, KPL and KGE, rose 1
cent per share for the first quarter this year because of higher
wholesale and retail sales. Earnings from Western's investment in
Oneok Inc., a natural gas company, dropped slightly because of a
warmer-than-normal winter.
</P>
<P>
   Western's investment in Protection One, which sells
monitored-security services, accounted for a loss of 4 cents per
share, compared with a loss of 3 cents per share for the same
period last year.

MISSOURI'S `CHRISTMAS TREE BILL' FULLY DECKED OUT THIS YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Every year an economic development measure in
the Missouri General Assembly suddenly becomes a magnet for similar
bills stuck in committee or languishing on debate calendars.
</P>
<P>
   Some call this annual exercise in cut-and-paste lawmaking ``the
Christmas tree bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon it are hung sales tax breaks, income tax credits,
government grants, cheap loans and other fiscal goodies to benefit
favored government agencies, single cities, private companies or
entire industries.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Kansas City's side of the tree was a little bare. But
companies such as Harley-Davidson and TWA and developers of Kansas
City's Power &AMP; Light District project were left with something to
cheer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't have as many ornaments as in past years,'' agreed
Bill Gamble, the council's longtime lobbyist in Jefferson City.
Then again, he noted, not all ornaments get hung on the Christmas
tree.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri's business community won huge victories in other bills,
including this year's pro-business centerpiece that exempts an
estimated 20,000 small employers from the state's franchise tax and
slashes the tax rate for others.
</P>
<P>
   Another provides tax credits for businesses making contributions
to a new state ``seed loan'' fund to help qualified but struggling
new companies with start-up expenses. Rockhurst College in Kansas
City is in line to be one of this area's seed loan administration
centers.
</P>
<P>
   If there are fewer ornaments on the 1999 Christmas tree, Gamble
said, he's just as thankful for the one he didn't have to hang.
</P>
<P>
   An effort by a rural lawmaker to restrict bonding authority for
neighborhood improvement districts statewide threatened to deliver
an inadvertent but possibly fatal blow to developers of the Power &AMP;
Light District project in downtown Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being able to sell up to $176 million worth of
low-interest bonds _ a key source of financing to be repaid from
project revenue _ the developers would have been limited to raising
just $1.2 million, Gamble said.
</P>
<P>
   The restrictive legislation died Friday, the last day of the
session, but not before Gamble and others were ready with an
amendment that would have exempted all of Kansas City's designated
neighborhood improvement districts from the bond restriction.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City and the metropolitan area ``had really strong
packages the last three years,'' said Rep. Henry Rizzo, a Kansas
City Democrat who sponsored this year's bill. He said that helped
explain why local interests got fewer provisions this year.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's legislation included Centertainment tax breaks and a
$5 million slice of the riverboat-casino pie to help repair the
Liberty Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Gamble said, separate state-budget appropriation
bills funneled $2 million to help retire city bond debt for Bartle
Hall and $3 million more for maintenance and repairs at the Truman
Sports Complex.
</P>
<P>
   Repair and patchwork on existing state laws are mostly what the
1999 Christmas tree bill accomplishes.
</P>
<P>
   Among its provisions, House Bill 701:
</P>
<P>
   _ Adds airports and air terminal service facilities to business
ventures qualified for enterprise zone tax credits.
</P>
<P>
   That Kansas City-inspired language was intended mostly to
benefit TWA in Kansas City and St. Louis, Rizzo said, if either
city government chooses to declare some or all of its airport an
enterprise zone. Kansas City officials are trying to extend TWA's
maintenance base lease, which is to expire next year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Authorizes a satellite enterprise zone for Independence to
develop its Fairmont neighborhood in the city's northwest area with
tax credits and other incentives to attract businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been really difficult to make things happen'' in the
area, said city development director Bruce Hahl.
</P>
<P>
   Enterprise zone tax incentives might be the missing piece of the
puzzle that finally attracts real estate developers to that area,
Hahl said. And, he added, one is already waiting in the wings with
a plan for senior housing and a clinic.
</P>
<P>
   That section also permits new enterprise zones in Randolph,
Callaway and Barton counties and expands zone population limits for
Kansas City to accommodate more and larger districts.
</P>
<P>
   It also provides assurances that businesses in enterprise zones
created since 1990 will remain in line to claim their promised 15
years of tax credits and other benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Gamble said a lawsuit decided earlier this year cast some doubt
over the legality of those long-term agreements made by cities and
counties.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives those companies some sense of security,'' Gamble
said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main beneficiaries will be Kansas City's new
Harley-Davidson manufacturing plant.
</P>
<P>
   _ Expands the current law's definition of film producers
eligible for up to $500,000 a year in annual income tax credits
when they film in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a cash cow for the city and the state to get them in
here,'' Rizzo said. ``But we're not competing right now. A majority
of the movies happening in the Midwest are being made in Illinois.
... I'm trying to establish Kansas City as a movie set.''
</P>
<P>
   Every once in a while, somebody hangs a lump of coal on the
Christmas tree. One of the final amendments added Friday was just
that for Missouri business owners.
</P>
<P>
   Under that change, any business discovered with undocumented
immigrants on the payroll can lose its state tax credits, tax
abatements or loans and be declared ineligible for such state aid
for five years.
</P>
<P>
   Undocumented immigrants ``have been flying into Missouri in
record numbers,'' Rizzo said. ``Rural areas are feeling it. We're
feeling it in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very big problem that is hard to track. We have to have
some accountability. ... There's going to be a price to pay.''

INTRUST FINANCIAL CORP. TO BUY KANAS U.S. BANCORP BRANCHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES R.T. CRUMPLEY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Intrust Financial Corp., which has had a low
profile in the Kansas City area even though it is the largest bank
holding company in Kansas, is poised to increase its strength in
the area.
</P>
<P>
   Intrust has agreed to buy 20 Kansas branches now owned by U.S.
Bancorp, based in Minneapolis. The locations include three suburban
branches.
</P>
<P>
   Intrust now has two suburban branches and a grocery store
branch.
</P>
<P>
   Intrust, with $2.1 billion in assets, is dominant in its
headquarters of Wichita but is weak in the Kansas City area.
</P>
<P>
   Intrust spokeswoman Diane Iseman said the company was looking
for ways to step up its presence in Johnson County, as well as in
the college towns of Manhattan and Lawrence, when ``this deal kind
of fell in our lap.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal was offered by U.S. Bancorp, which operates banks under
the name U.S. Bank. It entered Kansas in 1995 but never caught
fire. Its market share was too small to effectively sell its
products and services in Kansas, said a spokeswoman in Minneapolis.
U.S. Bancorp also said it planned to sell eight branches in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, Intrust will buy all of U.S. Bancorp's branches
in Kansas, including all $275 million in deposits, but not the
loans. Most branches are in the eastern half of the state, in towns
such as Emporia, Iola and Topeka. It is likely that four branches
in Wichita and one in El Dorado will be closed, Iseman said.
</P>
<P>
   The branches will continue to operate as U.S. Banks until the
sale is completed by about September.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Bancorp is the country's 14th-largest holding company, with
$76 billion in assets. It is also known for its purchase a year ago
of Piper Jaffray Cos. Inc., now known as U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray, the 11th-largest brokerage.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israelis overwhelmingly elected Ehud Barak, the
Labor Party leader, as prime minister on Monday, rejecting the
tumultuous leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, whose galvanizing
character has dominated Israel for three years.
</P>
<P>
   In a complete reshuffling of the political deck, Israelis also
remade their parliament: The right wing withered as the center grew
with four new parties, changing the balance of power.
</P>
<P>
   Because Barak can now assemble a large block of secular parties,
he has the option to form a government without any ultra-Orthodox
representation. The ultra-Orthodox appear to have lost their
exclusive role as a swing vote between left and right to the
Russian immigrants and other centrists.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday morning, with 99.99 percent of the vote counted,
Barak had 56 percent of the vote, to Netanyahu's 43.9 percent. It
was the second time that Israel had elected a prime minister
directly. Barak now has 45 days in which to form a government.
</P>
<P>
   A highly decorated former general, Barak, 57, is a dovish hawk
in the image of his mentor, Yitzhak Rabin, and the vote is a
resounding call for a revival of the languishing
Israeli-Palestinian peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Yitzhak is looking down on us from where he may, he knows
that we together will fulfill his legacy,'' Barak said in his
victory speech. ``We need to strengthen our country's security by
moving forward to peace agreements.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak also sounded a call for unity. ``It is my intention to be
everyone's prime minister,'' he said. ``All of Israel is part of
each of us, and we extend a courageous hand to all, to secular and
religious, to those of Ashkenazi and of Sephardic background, to
those who immigrated from the former Soviet Union and from
Ethiopia, to the Arabs, the Bedouins and the Circassians.''
</P>
<P>
   Within 35 minutes of the first television exit polls, before
Barak made any public comment, Netanyahu not only conceded defeat,
but stepped down as the leader of the conservative Likud Party.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank and Gaza, Palestinian officials gloated over
the political demise of a leader whom they considered hostile and
intransigent. Israeli Radio reported open celebrations in the
office of Paesltinian leader Yasser Arafat, who called to
congratulate Barak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Netanyahu fell into the trash bin of history,'' Fraih Abu
Meddien, the Palestinian justice minister said in an interview in
Gaza. ``He will be gone forever and good riddance. He's a racist
and no other Israeli leader will ever be as bad as he was. The
Palestinian people were patient for three years through his
arrogance. We helped bring him down. We are the ones who made this
statue fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before midnight in Tel Aviv, a huge celebration erupted
in Yitzhak Rabin Square, the site of the late prime minister's
assassination. With mixed emotions, tens of thousands of mostly
young Israelis both cheered Barak's victory and lit candles in
honor of Rabin, who was assassinated in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rabin, we have won!'' they shouted repeatedly into the balmy
evening air, crying and hugging each other.
</P>
<P>
   At the Tel Aviv Hilton Hotel, a few miles away, Netanyahu, a
fixture in Israeli politics for 15 years, strode off the political
stage quickly, cleanly, and with cordial congratulations to his
opponent. Flanked by his wife, Sarah, and by a grim Ariel Sharon,
his foreign minister, Netanyahu, with a serene look on his face,
addressed weeping supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nation decided and we respect that decision,'' Netanyahu
said, stunning his audience, which is unaccustomed to the sight of
their prime minister conceding anything. ``That is the way it has
to be in a democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's Likud Party, traditionally one of the two major
parties of Israel, suffered from his collapse at the polls.
Netanyau's Likud coalition held 32 seats in 1996, and the party was
down to about 20 with slightly fewer than half the votes counted.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the defectors left for Shas, the ultra-Orthodox
Sephardic party. In a stunning gain, Shas seemed to have garnered
six new seats in the new parliament, giving it about 17, making it
the third largest party after Likud and Labor, election analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
   But a larger representation does not mean more power. ``Shas is
in for four lean years now,'' Shahar Ilan, a religion reporter for
the newspaper Haaretz said Monday, ``whether it is a barely wanted
coalition partner or whether it remains outside.''
</P>
<P>
   While Shas had endorsed Netanyahu, it has swung between left and
right governments before as a supporter of the peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   But in these elections and probably in the new parliament,
Russian immigrants, who seem to have split their ballots between
the two candidates, represented the swing vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We resisted all efforts to take sides,'' Natan Sharansky,
leader of the Russians' Yisrael Baaliyah Party, said in an
interview. ``We were the party of the new immigrants, but now we
can be considered simply as the one real moderate force, like a
bridge between secular and nonsecular, left and right.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Look, I'm sorry for Bibi, we're old friends.'' He
said the defeat of Netanyahu was ``mainly personal, not
ideological.''
</P>
<P>
   But part of Netanyahu's defeat was not merely a rejection of
him, but of the right wing's perceived obstructionist agenda on the
peace effort. Most Israelis not only endorse the peace effort, but
accept that a Palestinian state is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   According to a statement from the prime minister's office,
President Clinton sent Netanyahu a message: ``I appreciate the hard
work you did. You're a strong man with a strong historical
awareness and we all believe you will be back.''
</P>
<P>
   Also according to the statement, Netanyahu responded, ``Thank
you very much but I'm taking a long vacation.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many Israelis were driving through the streets beeping their
horns, or popping the corks on champagne bottle. ``As soon as Bibi
said he was resigning, the champagne came out as did the
pistachios, cake and popcorn,'' said Lisa Feinmesser, 51, an
administrative assistant in Jerusalem. ``We're so sick of the
man.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking drawn and defeated, Gila Gamliel, a 24-year-old Likudnik
who lost her bid for parliament, said, ``Despite the great
accomplishments of the government, everyone was against us and
against the prime minister out of personal hatred.''
</P>
<P>
   A kibbutz-born Israeli who spent 35 years in the army and
retired as chief of staff, Barak is brainy and complex. He has
confidence in his own judgments, which are based, like those of any
serious military strategist, as much on input as intuition. Friends
say he is his own best counsel.
</P>
<P>
   He has conducted his campaign like a military exercise. Building
on a network of army buddies, he revitalized the Labor Party's
aging infrastructure with a far more professional campaign on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Barak also relied on layers of American consultants, including
two top American pollsters, who field-tested every question raised
by Barak about the mood of the Israeli public and the sectors
within it.
</P>
<P>
   He personally sought to commandeer a remake of the Labor Party,
which is traditionally both leftist and elitist in a peculiarly
Israeli combination, into a party of the center. He ran at the head
of the One Israel coalition, forged with Meimad, a moderate
Orthodox group, and the Sephardic Gesher Party of David Levy, the
Moroccan-born former foreign minister of Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   As a moderate at the helm of the left, he sees himself following
the lead of Bill Clinton and Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's political advertising has stressed his military
background, which includes a string of derring-do missions that are
an integral part of Israeli legend. His campaign has repeatedly
broadcast images of him liberating a Sabena airplane from
Palestinian terrorists, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, he has said he would move quickly to kick start
the moribund Israeli-Palestinian peace effort, to plan the
withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon, and to reopen
negotiations with Syria over Lebanon and the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Before the elections, many Israelis said they considered Barak
and Netanyahu to be cut from the same cloth, as Ashkenai members of
the elite who both served in the same elite military unit and both
studied in the United States. Israelis said they were confused
about what differentiated the candidates' stand on peace, since
both said they supported a tough peace with security.
</P>
<P>
   But the two men hold very different views about Israel's
relative position in the Mideast, which fundamentally shape
different approaches to peacemaking. Netanyahu believed Israel to
be in a constant state of threat from its Arab neighbors,
approached them with suspicion and refused to make concessions
until concessions were given.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, on the other hand, sees Israel as the strongest country
in a tough neighborhood, negotiating from a vantage point of
greater military might, higher economic standing and a sounder,
more democratic political system.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks peace agreements must be reached before conditions are
perfect, and that relationships should be sown to encourage
cooperation on security issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to give a new momentum to peace agreements,'' he said
in an interview in April. ``I'm not going to compromise any of our
vital interest. I will definitely fight against terror, I did it
all my life. But I learned during many years, decades of fighting
that the right way to bring about personal security to Israelis and
overall security to Israel is through peace agreement with our
neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Four and a quarter million Israelis voted, almost all the adults
in the country. Voter turn-out is always high here. Statistics say
it is 80 percent, but, given that about 10 percent of the
population lives abroad and there are no absentee ballots, the
figure is closer to 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of Israelis have been arriving from abroad to vote,
too.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Some things are unexplainable, and five years later Jeff Bagwell is
no closer to finding the words to describe his extraordinary,
can't-go-wrong season of 1994.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``1994 was kind of a crazy year for me,'' Bagwell said Sunday
night as the Astros prepared for a six-game West Coast swing that
begins tonight in Los Angeles. ``Everything that could go right for
me did that year.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time major-league players went on strike Aug. 12, 1994 _
wiping out the Astros' final 47 regular-season games, the playoffs
and the World Series _ Bagwell was on his way to being the runaway
choice for National League Most Valuable Player with a .368 batting
average, 39 home runs and 116 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Once in a lifetime? An oddity?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was amazing to myself some of the things that happened that
year,'' said Bagwell, the only Astro ever to be named league MVP.
``Everybody, every once in a while, has one of those years you
can't believe _ and that was my year.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is suggesting seven weeks into this season that a Bagwell
MVP watch should begin running in the newspaper, least of all
Bagwell. But with nearly one-fourth of this season in the books,
the 30-year-old first baseman's statistics are comparable to his
'94 totals.
</P>
<P>
   Through 36 games, Bagwell is batting .326 with 10 homers and 35
RBIs. At the same point in '94, Bagwell was batting .328 with nine
homers and 37 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bagwell is cautious. He has seen quick starts give way to
dreadful summers. One minute the balls are dropping for base hits
and sailing over the outfield walls at incredible clips. The next
minute every ball finds a glove, and every pitcher resembles a Cy
Young Award winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think too many people win the MVP award without
everything going right,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker said.
``There are a lot of guys in the league that are pretty good. When
you win that award, it has to be a career-type year. Some people
are capable of more than one of those years. He might be one of
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to compare him to '94. I don't think it is
likely that anybody will repeat what was done before. It might be
better; it might be worse. Just because it's the same now doesn't
mean it will be the same way at the end (of the season). I hope it
is. From this point forward in 1994, he got better.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell said what makes his MVP year stand out from his other
professional seasons is not just the start but how he maintained it
and actually improved over the course of 4{ months.
</P>
<P>
   After batting .330 over the first two months of '94, Bagwell
caught fire. From June 1 on, he batted .399 with 27 homers and 68
RBIs before suffering a fractured left hand two days before the
strike halted play.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell had an 18-game hitting streak, and his average never
went below .323. He led the league in RBIs, runs (104), total bases
(300) and slugging percentage (.750). His power was the biggest
surprise to Bagwell, who hit 20 homers in 1993 and had 53 in his
first three Astros seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``For three months _ and for the first and only time in my life
_ I can actually say I was a good player,'' Bagwell joked. ``I got
a lot of hits and drove in some runs for the first six to eight
weeks. I really didn't feel that great at the plate. All of a
sudden, right before June started, I kind of clicked, and after
that I got in the batter's box the same way every single day. I
felt real comfortable in there for the longest period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding that hitting groove _ and keeping it _ can be
hit-or-miss.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Bagwell batted .337 in April and .360 in May and hit 18
home runs during the two-month opening stretch. He dropped to .277
in June and .230 in July. He had only 13 homers over the final four
months.
</P>
<P>
   In '97, Bagwell opened with a .326 batting average for the first
two months. In July and August, he hit just .239.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Bagwell struggled through one of the worst starts
of his career, batting .236 with 22 RBIs through May. He hit .320
or better in three of the final four months.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look back, I never quite found that feeling when I got
into the batter's box every day and did not have to do much to
alter things during the course of the year,'' Bagwell said. ``(In
1994) I could just make a small adjustment within an at-bat, and I
was back where I needed to be. For those other couple of years, it
didn't happen. Some days I get there; some days I don't. When I go
on a long streak of hitting well, I'm usually pretty comfortable,
and I don't have to think about it too much. All I have to think
about is getting a good pitch to hit. This game is so weird,
because every year is different, and you never know what's going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to this year and the possibility Bagwell could
be on his way to duplicating his feat of five years ago. He had a
productive spring, which involved a slight adjustment in the way he
grips the bat. And with the exception of the first week of the
season when the Astros' entire offense struggled, Bagwell has
noticed himself doing the things that made 1994 magical.
</P>
<P>
   Since April 16, his average has gone as high as .396 and not
dipped below its current .326. He has hit safely in 30 of the first
36 games, including 14 in a row at one point.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell ranks in the top 10 in the NL in 13 categories,
including RBIs (35), runs (31), walks (25), hits (43) and home runs
(10).
</P>
<P>
   Need further proof of the similarities between '94 and '99 to
date? Bagwell had a three-homer game in both seasons, accomplishing
the feat April 21 at Chicago this year when he moved to the top of
the Astros' all-time home-run list.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a totally complete player,'' Dierker said. ``He's one of
those guys you would say was born to play baseball. This is what
he's meant to do.''
</P>
<P>
   And with the addition of Moises Alou last season and Ken
Caminiti this year to add more power to an already potent lineup,
Bagwell doesn't feel the same kind of pressure to produce at the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   However, that hasn't stopped him. In the four seasons after his
MVP campaign, Bagwell averaged 32 home runs, 113 RBIs and a .299
batting average.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty tough on myself and have a certain standard of how
I should be playing every single night and through the course of
the year,'' Bagwell said. ``Last year when I was struggling so bad,
it made it easier on me because we won. But no matter what happens,
I still want to be able to do the things I'm capable of doing.''

WILL BUSS LET RAMBIS BUILD CHAMPIONSHIP TEAM?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ I'd like to trade places with Jerry Buss for a day
and not just so I could unleash my inner child without having to
worry about cleaning up after it.
</P>
<P>
   Put me in charge of the Lakers and the first thing I'd do is
take that interim label that Kurt Rambis has been wearing and dump
it in the trash along with Buss's bulging black book.
</P>
<P>
   I realize there are people ready to install Chuck Daly or Phil
Jackson in the seat Rambis has been keeping warm since late
February. Rambis must recognize it, too. How else to explain why he
treats most postgame interview sessions as though they're being
moderated by Procrustes?
</P>
<P>
   Rambis' testiness is understandable, given his uncertain future.
Not that he'll admit to being the least bit fazed. He professes not
to look beyond the next game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever happens, happens,'' he says. ``I know I want the job,
but whether I get the job is completely out of my control.''
</P>
<P>
   So many things have been out of his control this shortened
season, it's a wonder he hasn't gone screaming into the night. Then
again, Rambis never was one to shy away from a challenge. As a
player he distinguished himself with his enthusiasm, his
doggedness, his grasp of the game and his allergy to the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   These are the same qualities he brings to coaching. And if he's
feeling his way on the bench, well, all I can say is the Bulls'
dynasty under Jackson wasn't built in a day. Rambis is going to
take a team a long way some day. Wouldn't it make you sick if it
weren't the Lakers?
</P>
<P>
   All year we've seen the changing of the guard: from Michael
Jordan to Allen Iverson; from John Stockton to Jayson Williams;
from Chicago to Philadelphia; from David Robinson to Tim Duncan. So
why shouldn't the old give way to the new in coaching, too?
</P>
<P>
   Let it start with Rambis. I feel for him. I really do. Right now
in Texas, only George W. Bush has any idea what it's like to
audition for a job in such a public manner. When Rambis was named
to replace the deposed Del Harris, he couldn't have foreseen how
literal the title of ``head'' coach would turn out to be.
</P>
<P>
   Goodness knows Rambis has spent more time adjusting psyches than
plays. He worked harder at exorcising Dennis Rodman's demons than
did Rodman. In the end, Rambis didn't fail Rodman so much as Rodman
failed himself. If that makes Rambis a bad coach, as Rodman
asserted at the time of his release, well, good luck to the very
talented, very troubled forward in his search for someone more
capable.
</P>
<P>
   As if dealing with Rodman weren't a sufficient test, Rambis also
had to deal with the fallout of a major trade and the
post-traumatic stress syndrome that Glen Rice and J.R. Reid
experienced upon arriving from Charlotte. It's no small selling job
Rambis pulled off, getting Reid to buy into the notion of putting
his energy into defense instead of scoring.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers are reaping the dividends. Reid made life in the low
post miserable for Houston's Charles Barkley in the first round of
the playoffs and he was the reason Tim Duncan got off to a slow
start in the first quarter of a Western Conference semifinal game
the San Antonio Spurs went on to win, 87-81.
</P>
<P>
   Rice is a piece that Rambis continues to try to fit into the
puzzle. He was the Hornets' top scoring threat but finds himself
the No. 3 option with the Lakers, after Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe
Bryant. It's not as though Rambis has expunged Rice from the team's
diet. He has called plays for the forward, who returned to the
lineup Monday after sitting out Saturday's first-round finale
against the Rockets with a stiff elbow. Unfortunately, Rambis is
helpless to set the screens that make his scribblings come alive.
</P>
<P>
   Say this about Rambis: He doesn't hesitate to control what he
can. I love that he purged the practice gym of all security escorts
and assorted other hangers-on. If grade-school-age kids can make it
through a practice without their mommies, why can't a professional
athlete get through one without his bodyguard? Honestly, who are
they seeking protection from, anyway? Themselves, perhaps?
</P>
<P>
   Rambis also has impressed me with his handling of O'Neal and
Bryant. There are coaches who would have been inclined to treat
like Faberge eggs the egos of the Lakers' two standout players.
Plenty of unproven coaches would have cut the stars a lot of slack,
lest they alienate their meal tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Rambis hasn't been at all reluctant to hold the reins of
authority. He has shattered a clipboard in disgust and shouted back
at a defiant Bryant. He has benched O'Neal and Bryant to drive home
their deficiencies, gutsy moves that had the effect of amplifying
their respect for him even as they sat silently cursing him.
</P>
<P>
   The rookie head coach would be the first to tell you he has a
lot to learn. The encouraging thing is, he doesn't pretend to be
omniscient. Rambis owns up to his mistakes and in doing so, sets an
example of accountability for O'Neal, Bryant and Co.
</P>
<P>
   That's why there's every reason to think the Lakers can recover
from Monday's setback. On Wednesday, look for hot-shooting Spurs
guard Avery Johnson to have a hand in his face whenever he has the
ball. Expect Bryant to penetrate more on offense. Count on seeing
less of Duncan and more Lakers' points off the fast break.
</P>
<P>
   Rambis will show them the way. And the Lakers, not wanting to
let him down, will take it from there.

SPURS SLASH LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The three-inch reddish scratch just below
Shaquille O'Neal's neck told the tale he would not. O'Neal was
poked, prodded, battered, scratched and generally manhandled by the
Twin Towers of the San Antonio Spurs on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Fair or foul, it worked.
</P>
<P>
   With Tim Duncan and David Robinson muscling up in tandem, the
Spurs completely disrupted O'Neal, and in turn, the Los Angeles
Lakers, to forcibly take an 87-81 victory in Game 1 of the Western
Conference semifinals at the Alamodome.
</P>
<P>
   When all the banging subsided, O'Neal turned to desperate
measures. He chewed out referee Steve Javie until Derek Fisher and
coach Kurt Rambis intervened.
</P>
<P>
   Missing 13 of 19 shots has that kind of effect on a big man.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got real frustrated,'' Robert Horry said. ``You can tell
when he gets frustrated, because he doesn't say anything. That's
when he's at the point of no return. At one point he just stopped
saying stuff and got back down the court.''
</P>
<P>
   That stance carried right into the postgame session.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, who actually had a better shooting rate at the
free-throw line (9 of 14), claimed he was not upset, in a rare show
of self-restraint.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. We've seen how they're going to let us play, so we just
have to make adjustments,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not upset with the calls?
</P>
<P>
   ``I just missed some shots that I usually make.''
</P>
<P>
   So, that lecture to Javie?
</P>
<P>
   ``I just missed some shots that I usually make.''
</P>
<P>
   Not frustrated?
</P>
<P>
   ``I never get frustrated. You guys see what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Horry said what O'Neal wouldn't. Despite Spurs' rare shutdown of
the league's premier center, he was unimpressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want the truth, they didn't do a good job at all,''
Horry said, ``because if you look at the fim, a lot of times they
(committed) fouls, there was no call. So in my opinion they didn't
do a good job. It's just that they was at home, and they had some
home-cookin'.''
</P>
<P>
   They also had a lot of fouls to give, sending Malik Rose and
Will Perdue at O'Neal when Robinson and Duncan didn't go.
</P>
<P>
   Once O'Neal was derailed, the Lakers wilted.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan was nearly unstoppable, deftly surviving double-teams to
score a game-high 25 points on 11-of-24 shooting. And he was
devastating on defense, blocking six shots, misdirecting plenty
more.
</P>
<P>
   His job was made all the easier by a Lakers offense that fell
into disarray as O'Neal broke down.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal was more frank about the Lakers' chances to come back in
Game 2 on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the best they can play and we still had a couple
opportunities to win the game,'' he said. ``Once we pick our level
of play up we're gonna be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news for the Lakers was the return of Glen Rice, who
had been suffering from a sore and stiff right elbow since Friday
and skipped the Lakers' series-clinching game against Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Rice scored 21 points on 8-of-17 shooting. Kobe Bryant added 21
points.
</P>
<P>
   Down 0-1 in the series, the Lakers now to turn to the well-worn
steal-one-on-the-road approach. But Rambis said there was no
particular agenda aside from the obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``You play every game to win every game,'' he said. ``To me,
it's just become cliche-ish to say that we just wanna win one out
of two, and then if you win the first one, `Well all we gotta do is
win the second one.' ... You wanna win every single ballgame. The
quicker you win four, the better off you are. So it's not a matter
of just trying to get a split. Plus, the situation our team is in,
we're still developing, improving and growing as a team. So we want
to keep playing better and better.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until less than an hour before tipoff that the Lakers
determined Rice would be available. He shot earlier in the day, for
the first time since Friday, but the Lakers were cautious and held
off on a decision until the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess he looked all right (at shootaround), but it's not
like we went hard and everything,'' Rambis said. ``That's not a
good criteria to base whether someone should play or not.''

BACKUPS MUCKING UP ANGELS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ If you want to know how injuries have changed
the Anaheim Angels, check this: The team's starting left fielder
Sunday night was Dave Silvestri. Its right fielder was Tim Unroe.
</P>
<P>
   Because of injuries to shortstop Gary DiSarcina, center fielder
Jim Edmonds and, most recently, right fielder Tim Salmon, players
who are normally utility or backup players are starting for the
Angels.
</P>
<P>
   How long can names such as Silvestri, Unroe, Orlando Palmeiro,
Reggie Williams, Andy Sheets and Jeff Huson appear in the lineup
before the team falls out of the pennant race altogether? Angels
manager Terry Collins said he doesn't concern himself with things
beyond his control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't worry about anything except what I got, anything
except the 25 guys here,'' Collins said. ``I write down position by
position, and all of a sudden, there's today's lineup. I don't sit
there and say to myself, `I wish I had that guy,' or `Gee,
so-and-so isn't playing, maybe we can get him.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That's general manager Bill Bavasi's job. And with Salmon
(sprained left wrist) and DiSarcina (broken bone in left forearm)
out until early July, and Edmonds (shoulder surgery) out until
August, there is definitely a need for replacements. Bavasi,
though, wouldn't call it an urgent need out of respect for the
players he has now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always looking,'' he said. ``We always have to look.
We're lucky to have the guys we have. The guys filling in are good
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you can improve your club, you have to. We'll always
make attempts to get better.''

 SOX GET IN THEIR LAST LICKS
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   TORONTO _ Perhaps this is what they mean by the ultimate secret
weapon. It's the one unrecognized not only by the enemy, but by the
good guys, too.
</P>
<P>
   Ever heard of Brian Daubach, Jimy Williams was asked, before the
Red Sox signed him last winter?
</P>
<P>
   ``To be very honest, no,'' the manager said Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   First time Mike Stanley heard the name? Spring training, when
Daubach was one of the huddled masses on the other side of the
aisle in the clubhouse in Fort Myers. Same for John Valentin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure most of these guys never heard of me,'' said Daubach,
the 27-year-old minor league lifer who will require fewer
introductions after hitting a three-run home run in Monday night's
8-7 win over the Toronto Blue Jays that not only was his first home
run in the big leagues, but was delivered with exquisite timing.
</P>
<P>
   The Belleville Basher (the nickname is on loan from fellow
townsman Jimmy Connors, the tennis player) broke a 4-4 tie in the
ninth by treating Toronto reliever Graeme Lloyd with the same
impundence Connors showed many another Aussie, swatting Lloyd's
first pitch on a blistering line over the right-field fence with a
two-handed forehand.
</P>
<P>
   Daubach didn't see the ball clear the wall and land in the Red
Sox bullpen until he'd already reached first base.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing I wanted to do was show anybody up,'' Daubach
said with some embarrassment, ``but I gave it a little fist pump.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't against (Lloyd). It was for nine years' worth of
work in the minors.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley, sitting quietly at one end of the winners' clubhouse,
seemed to take as much pleasure in the crowd gathered around
Daubach as the center of attention himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's so exciting,'' Stanley said. ``To get your first home
run, and have it be a game-winner. Do I remember my first one?
Yeah, and it sure wasn't a game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll never forget the first one. He'll never forget who it
was against, and the special meaning it had, being a game-winner.''
</P>
<P>
   In his joy for Daubach, the first baseman overlooked a salient
point. At the time, Daubach's home run looked like a game-winner,
but the run that ultimately made the difference was delivered by
Stanley himself, who followed Nomar Garciaparra's double off Lloyd
with a single off another reliever, Tom Davey.
</P>
<P>
   That was the fifth run of an inning that had begun with the Sox
trailing, 4-3, after Shawn Green's 13th home run off reliever John
Wasdin in the seventh. But the Sox' third win in four games here _
and their first this season that came in their last at-bat _ did
not come without a final dollop of suspense, as Tom Gordon was
clipped for three runs in the bottom of the ninth and put the
winning run on base before striking out Kevin Witt to end it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sure not going to get any easier,'' said Stanley, already
looking ahead to a three-game set that begins Tuesday night at
Fenway Park against the Yankees, who are a half-game ahead of the
Sox in the American League East.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yankees are coming to town, then these guys (Blue Jays)
come back to our place, then we go to New York and Cleveland. This
is a tough little stretch that began with this series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't sit on our laurels with what we've done here. We've
got to turn the page and get after it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox had tied the score in the ninth when gimpy-legged John
Valentin, delivering a pinch hit for the first time in more than
three years (April 14, 1996), singled after Lloyd hit Damon Buford
with a pitch to open the inning. Jose Offerman followed with his
fourth hit of the night, an RBI single to tie the score. It was
Offerman's second four-hit game of the season, the other coming in
his Sox debut April 5 in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto manager Jim Fregosi ordered Jeff Frye walked to set up
the lefty-lefty matchup he wanted, Lloyd vs. Daubach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going into that at-bat, I'd had a pretty rough night,'' said
Daubach, who hadn't gotten the ball out of the infield in four
previous at-bats but still managed to be accused of stealing signs
by Blue Jays starter Chris Carpenter after reaching base twice on
errors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty good, the way I was able to turn it around.''
</P>
<P>
   By his own admission, Daubach could just as easily have been
back home in Illinois, playing softball on his brother's team,
Demo's Sports Bar, as he was here, getting regular playing time as
part of Williams's no-apparent-rhyme-no-apparent-reason platoon in
the No. 3 hole.
</P>
<P>
   His home run came, incidentally, on the same day the former
occupant of the No. 3 spot in the Sox order, M. Vaughn, was named
the American League's Player of the Week for his efforts on behalf
of Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   That mattered little to Daubach. He was looking forward to the
fact that his mom and dad were making the trip from Belleville to
Yawkey Way Tuesday night. He had a little souvenir he wanted to
show them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him walk in with the ball,'' Stanley said. ``I told him
Tim Wakefield had the best handwriting. I told him to get him,
maybe not tonight, but in the next few days, and get himself a nice
little insignia.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that they've gotten acquainted, Stanley said what he likes
most about Daubach is his confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, gosh,'' he said, ``it seeps.''
</P>
<P>
   The Basher vs. The Bombers. Pedro vs. Cone. 7:05, Yawkey Way.
There are, after all, no secrets.

SAN ANTONIO _ The meek may inherit the earth, but they're not going
to win many NBA championships.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That's a lesson the San Antonio Spurs have apparently finally
realized, and they were quick to show the Los Angeles Lakers their
newfound toughness Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs, employing strong-arm tactics that would make Hulk
Hogan blush, slapped the Lakers silly, taking an 87-81 decision
before 25,297 at Alamodome. The win gave San Antonio a 1-0 lead in
the best-of-seven series, which resumes here Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers blew into town as the biggest, baddest bullies on the
NBA's block, especially after manhandling the Rockets. So the
Lakers had a bit more swagger in their step as they looked ahead to
the Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   Put it this way: If the Lakers were rap, the Spurs were elevator
music. They were the league's two-ply, squeezably soft good guys.
The guys who made turning the other cheek an art form.
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore. At least if Monday's game was any indication.
</P>
<P>
   When they decided to get physical, the Spurs obviously had
Shaquille O'Neal in mind. After having his way with the Rockets,
O'Neal was roughed up by the Spurs, one reason he made just six of
his 19 field-goal attempts. He was able to get the rest of his 21
points from the foul line, where he hit nine of 14 free throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a great defensive ballclub, and we have to take
advantage of that,'' said Mario Elie, who has added some
much-needed toughness to the Spurs. ``We sent a lot of guys at Shaq
to try and wear him down. He can beat you. I watched that Houston
series, how he dominated them (averaging 29.5 points in four
games), and I thought we did a good job clamping down not only on
him but everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal shrugged off the loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played great basketball tonight,'' he said. ``They
outplayed us. They played more aggressively, and we made a lot of
mental mistakes. But we still had a chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to make some adjustments and come back Wednesday.
They had double and triple teams coming at me really quick tonight,
and I missed a lot of shots I usually make.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't even ask what the Spurs were doing to Kobe Bryant, a
defensive scheme that bordered on child abuse. Any time Bryant, or
any other Laker, took off to attack the basket, the Spurs made sure
they put a body on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we did a much better job of that tonight,'' said David
Robinson, who finished with 15 points and eight rebounds for the
Spurs. ``That's a really good cut-and-slash team, and if you take
away some of those opportunities, then it makes the game a little
tougher for them. I thought we did a better job of that. That was
good. That was a key tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant shook off the whipping to score 21 points but struggled
down the stretch, missing several easy shots around the basket in
the final five minutes as the Lakers were trying to rally. And
O'Neal looked just as drained, grabbing only one of his 15 rebounds
in the final quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's part of the game,'' said Bryant of the physical play.
``It's a different brand of basketball in the playoffs. When you go
up against Robinson and (Tim) Duncan, you just have to make up your
mind what you are going to do before you make your move and they
can spread their wings.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs, and Duncan in particular, were feeding off the
transfer of power, going to the basket as often as they pleased.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan powered his way to a 25-point, seven-rebound night,
hitting 11 of his 24 shots and blocking six shots. And Robinson,
whose manhood has been questioned by O'Neal several times over the
past few years, was up to the challenge, shaking off early foul
trouble to finish strong, often challenging the Lakers with strong
drives to the basket instead of settling for the outside jumper.
</P>
<P>
   Not so Glen Rice. Despite finishing with 21 points, Rice was
pretty much a non-factor offensively, shying away from drives when
he saw the defensive tactics the Spurs were utilizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is really being able to do the the physical stuff but
also staying focused on what you're trying to do,'' Robinson said.
``You don't want to get crazy, but at the same time you have to
protect your space.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither team shot well, with the Lakers hitting just 38 percent
from the floor (30 of 79) and the Spurs only 41.9 percent (31 of
74). The difference was the bench play. With Robinson in early foul
trouble, Will Perdue came in and finished with six points and a
team-high nine rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead 67-58 entering the final period, the Spurs expanded that
lead to 15 points on a jumper from Antonio Daniels with 7:20 to
play. The Lakers were forced to call a timeout to regroup, and they
did.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant had two straight baskets, including a 360-degree dunk off
a steal, to spark an 8-0 run by the Lakers _ a streak that was
fueled by three straight San Antonio turnovers. Rice drilled a
baseline jumper that pulled the Lakers within 79-72 with 5:16 left,
and Robinson finally stopped the bleeding with a free throw 22
seconds later, giving the Spurs an 80-72 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers couldn't chip away any more, though, until it was far
too late.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Spurs were the picture of offensive efficiency,
turning the ball over nine times and missing seven free throws in
the fourth quarter. All that allowed the Lakers to get within five
points with under 20 seconds to play, but Robert Horry missed a
3-pointer with 17.8 seconds left to play, and Elie dropped in a
free throw to bump the lead up to 85-79.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're much better when we play team defense like that,'' said
Spurs coach Gregg Popovich. ``We're so much better when we're
rotating well and aggressive. That's the way we have to play
defense if we hope to beat this Laker team.''

SAN ANTONIO _ The Diesel blew down I-10 with a full head of steam.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal had just slammed the Rockets in four games and
never looked bigger, stronger or badder. It was a runaway Shaq
Daddy, the road was clear, and there were the San Antonio Spurs,
like their mascot Coyote, looking like potential road kill.
</P>
<P>
   What about the Spurs' David Robinson? What about Tim Duncan?
</P>
<P>
   ``They can see me on the court or off the court,'' O'Neal
mumbled. ``They can't do nothing with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Give The Diesel credit. Individually, neither Robinson nor
Duncan indeed stood a chance, much less his ground, against the
7-1, 330-pound Shaq on Monday night. But amid all the bodacious
buildup to what figures to be a tough and emotional Western
Conference series, take notice of how O'Neal said nothing about the
Spurs' Will Perdue and Malik Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Nor should he have.
</P>
<P>
   There were a lot of reasons why the Spurs swept to an 87-81 win
over the Los Angeles Lakers in the semifinal opener, not the least
of which was the Spurs' own unstoppable force. Duncan gave Lakers
forwards J.R. Reid and Robert Horry everything but nervous twitches
on the way to sliding up, under, around and over their poor excuses
for defense for 25 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank goodness we had Tim,'' Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said.
</P>
<P>
   But it was on the defensive end, where Hack-a-Shaq has become
all the NBA's rage against the monstrous O'Neal, where the Spurs
seemed to perfect the strategy and definitely clinched the game.
</P>
<P>
   And it was Perdue and Rose _ Big Ugly and Little Ugly _ who were
the most unlikely of heroes. In a critical first-half run that
finally gave the Spurs an edge after a sluggish start, Perdue and
Rose lent a hand _ and a knee, elbow, chest, thigh and seemingly
even a few small yard tools on occasion _ to Robinson and Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the night, after O'Neal managed just 6-of-19
shooting from the field, the Spurs had knocked around his senses so
much that he even began hitting free throws. It was a virtually
Rick Barry-like 9-for-14 from the line for the big fellow if you're
keeping track. And O'Neal's 21 points and 15 rebounds showed
nothing if not resiliency.
</P>
<P>
   But the Spurs showed how it's done against the most powerful
force in the game. And in the process, they might have shown why
they'll have an edge against the Lakers that the Rockets never
showed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to make him work harder than he has, and we did,''
Popovich said. ``Not only did (Perdue and Rose) guard and rebound,
but they scored and gave us some good minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Wearing that goofy faceguard and slouching over and gasping for
breath during breaks, Perdue might have looked overmatched against
O'Neal. And it might have looked like anything but a fair fight
when the 6-7, 240-pound Rose started trying to push O'Neal out of
the lane.
</P>
<P>
   But throughout the early run that brought the Spurs from as many
as 10 points down to a six-point halftime lead, it was Perdue and
Rose doing the dirty work, while Robinson, Duncan or both swept in
at the last moment to swipe at an O'Neal shot.
</P>
<P>
   Eight times, Duncan and Robinson blocked shots in the
impressively defensive game. Four of those blocks came against
O'Neal, unheard of in the Rockets-Lakers series.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers coach Kurt Rambis said he never had seen O'Neal roughed
up as much as he was in Monday night's game. Rambis thought more
fouls should have been called.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time the Spurs finally put away the Lakers with late
free throws and big stretch-time buckets by Robinson (15 points,
eight rebounds), it was clear this was a perfectly executed
execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Game 1 is over. That's all I can say,'' O'Neal said. ``We have
to see how the (officials) are going to let us play. The Spurs have
players. They played pretty good. They were the aggressors.''
</P>
<P>
   On the way into San Antonio, O'Neal lost his luggage. But the
weakness of this Lakers team wasn't exposed, naked, until the Spurs
used a pair of seven-footers as a second line of defense while
Perdue and Rose hacked away.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, if Glen Rice (21 points) is the only outside threat the
Lakers have, which he was Monday, Robinson and Duncan might
continue to pay only cursory attention to Reid, Horry and the like
while collapsing on O'Neal after he makes his move.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't even close to a beautiful game. But it looked
wonderful to the Spurs. The Lakers hit just 38 percent of their
shots, and everyone got into the act for San Antonio. Perdue scored
six points and grabbed nine rebounds in O'Neal's face, for
goodness' sake.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good win for us because of how we did it,'' Popovich
said.
</P>
<P>
   It was Hack-a-Shaq redefined. Just imagine how the Spurs might
have rolled if O'Neal wasn't stroking those free throws.

<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The three-inch reddish scratch just below
Shaquille O'Neal's neck told the tale he would not. O'Neal was
poked, prodded, battered, scraped and generally manhandled by the
Twin Towers of the San Antonio Spurs on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Fair or foul, it worked.
</P>
<P>
   With Tim Duncan and David Robinson muscling up in tandem, the
Spurs completely disrupted O'Neal and, in turn, the Lakers, to
forcibly take an 87-81 victory in Game 1 of the Western Conference
semifinals at the Alamodome.
</P>
<P>
   When all the banging subsided, O'Neal turned to desperate
measures. He chewed out referee Steve Javie until Derek Fisher and
coach Kurt Rambis intervened.
</P>
<P>
   Missing 13 of 19 shots has that kind of effect on a big man.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got real frustrated,'' Robert Horry said. ``You can tell
when he gets frustrated, because he doesn't say anything. That's
when he's at the point of no return. At one point he just stopped
saying stuff and got back down the court.''
</P>
<P>
   That stance carried right into the postgame session.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, who actually had a decent shooting rate at the
free-throw line (9 of 14), finishing with 21 points, claimed he was
not upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. We've seen how they're going to let us play, so we just
have to make adjustments,'' he said, in a rare show of
self-restraint.
</P>
<P>
   Not upset with the calls?
</P>
<P>
   ``I just missed some shots that I usually make.''
</P>
<P>
   So, that lecture to Javie?
</P>
<P>
   ``I just missed some shots that I usually make.''
</P>
<P>
   Not frustrated?
</P>
<P>
   ``I never get frustrated. You guys see what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Horry said what O'Neal wouldn't. Despite the Spurs' rare
shutdown of the league's premier center, he was unimpressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want the truth, they didn't do a good job at all,''
Horry said, ``because if you look at the film, a lot of times they
(committed) fouls, there was no call. So in my opinion, they didn't
do a good job. It's just that they was at home and they had some
home cookin'.''
</P>
<P>
   Once O'Neal was derailed, the Lakers wilted.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan was nearly unstoppable, deftly surviving double-teams to
score a game-high 25 points on 11-of-24 shooting. And he was
devastating on defense, blocking six shots and misdirecting many
others.
</P>
<P>
   His job was made all the easier by a Lakers' offense that fell
into disarray as O'Neal broke down.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Rice, returning from a sore elbow, and Kobe Bryant both hit
8 of 17 shots for 21 points each, as the Lakers shot 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
   After taking an early 12-point lead, the Lakers let the Spurs
take control with an endless series of forced shots and bad passes.
They committed 10 turnovers, with just 13 assists.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers had built a 24-12 lead with 1:39 to go in the first
but were then held without a field goal for eight minutes. San
Antonio closed out the quarter with an 8-0 run, climaxing with a
31-foot 3-pointer by Jerome Kersey at the buzzer to cut the lead to
24-20. The Lakers never led again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got down a couple of times, they made some runs and we
started to rush things,'' said Derek Fisher, who scored 13 points.
``We were searching for the home runs. If we had kept our poise a
little bit during certain stretches of the game, we would have been
in great position. But this is Game 1, and we feel very confident
coming back in here Wednesday night that we can get a win.''
</P>
<P>
   That confidence stemmed in large part from the fact that, as bad
as the Lakers were, they had a chance down the stretch. They
trailed by as much as 15 in the fourth quarter but got it down to
five with a minute left and were within four, 83-79, with 24.4
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   But Horry airballed a baseline jumper, O'Neal missed a
two-footer and the rally fell shot.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal was almost cocky in his assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the best they can play,'' he said, ``and we still had a
couple opportunities to win the game. Once we pick our level of
play up we're going to be fine.''

MARINERS IN MIDDLE OF BASEBALL'S FREE AGENCY MESS

<P>
   SEATTLE _ If Timberwolves forward Kevin Garnett and his $120
million, franchise-bending contract was what scared the pants off
NBA owners, forced the re-opening of the collective bargaining
agreement and sent the league into a long lockout that lasted until
a new deal that capped costs was inked at the 11th hour, what about
Alex Rodriguez?
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-three years after the dawn of baseball free agency, could
the 23-year-old Mariners shortstop be the gifted, young superstar
whose next contract sends the final, knee-knocking shiver down the
weak spine of major league baseball?
</P>
<P>
   We all know A-Rod is destined for greatness, so why not let his
impending free agency (after 2000 when the guess is he goes for
$150 million) be the one that topples baseball's disastrous
business model _ or lack-thereof.
</P>
<P>
   One can only hope such an industry-altering upheaval is on
baseball's horizon. The Mariners are waiting. Otherwise, without
some sort of drastic reform, the future of the Mariners and almost
every other team that isn't in New York, Chicago or Los Angeles
will have to settle for playing in the Little League World Series
with Taiwan and Taipei and Tom's River, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Dodgers and Yankees or Braves and Orioles will
battle it out each November on some super cable empire pay-per-view
station for the New Interplanetary World Series.
</P>
<P>
   If you think ``Star Wars'' is creating a buzz ...
</P>
<P>
   This week, it seems especially appropriate to ponder the fate of
A-Rod, the M's, small-market (or have-not) teams and baseball's
inexcusable inability to put together some sort of industry-saving
plan.
</P>
<P>
   No, they can't ruin the game of baseball. The game is perfect.
But that doesn't mean there won't be a day when fans wake up and
their local ``major league team'' has flat out folded, disappeared,
gone out of business because it was impossible not to succumb to
the ravages of an industry that can no longer succeed.
</P>
<P>
   If the Penguins are bankrupt in the NHL, how far behind is
Montreal or Pittsburgh's Pirates or maybe even the Mariners, whose
debt load is about $300 million and the owners already know the new
stadium won't be the answer?
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, one of our favorite annual reports was released.
Forbes magazine has discovered that 14 of major league baseball's
30 teams lost money in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Now, we all know a franchise losing money is not a good sign _
though there are some baseball owners who deserve very little
sympathy for this tide of red ink.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers lost $11.7 million on an estimated $108 million in
revenue. Poor Rupert Murdoch, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Other teams with operating losses were Kansas City ($10.9
million;) Toronto ($9.5 million;) Milwaukee ($8.8 million;)
Mariners ($8.6 million;) Padres ($8 million;) Cubs ($7.9 million;)
Boston ($7.6 million;) Minnesota ($7.1 million;) San Francisco
($6.4 million;) Mets ($5.2 million;) Houston ($3.7 million) and
Anaheim ($200,000.)
</P>
<P>
   The real problem with so many teams losing money is that it has
created this chasm between the haves and the have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see the disparity growing, both in terms of gross
revenue and payroll,'' baseball commissioner Bud Selig said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, disparity is the No. 1 problem we have. It's only
getting worse. It's a problem that has to be dealt with,'' Selig
said.
</P>
<P>
   Selig's comments came not long after the Dodgers signed pitcher
Kevin Brown to a deal last December that pays Brown $15 million a
year and makes him baseball's first $100 million player.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone is well accustomed to saying that the sky is falling
for baseball, but the Dodgers' deal with Brown _ plane rides home
in the Fox jet and all _ was legitimately seen as the latest,
gravest break in the economic barrier.
</P>
<P>
   If Brown is worth $100 million, what is Ken Griffey worth? What
is A-Rod worth? How can the M's possibly sign one of the them, let
alone both, unless the M's are praying baseball institutes
something like a salary cap so that parity is achievable, like in
the NFL, NBA and NHL.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, when baseball can no longer provide fans and
players the chance that their team starts opening day as a
contender, the game is in serious trouble.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one has to question whether there already is something
inherently unfair about this game. The answer seems obviously
``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Alderson, baseball's new executive vice president of
operations, went so far as to propose that some small-market teams
should be up front and tell fans that their home team is merely an
entertainment product, not a competitive opponent, since there is
little hope their team will beat the Yankees, Braves or Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Seattle, where the payroll is holding at about $50
million, it is a daily struggle to wonder how much of the M's woes
are because of poor trades by vice president of baseball operations
Woody Woodward or because Mariner owners might as well spend $20
million if they aren't going to spend $80 million _ the going rate
these days for a contender.
</P>
<P>
   If the Mariners are lucky, baseball will be brought to its knees
before A-Rod's Darth Vader agent brings them to theirs.

30 teams lost money in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Now, we all know a franchise losing money is not a good sign _
though there are some baseball owners who deserve very little
sympathy for the tide of red ink.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers lost $11.7 million on an estimated $108 million in
revenue. Poor Rupert Murdoch, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Other teams with operating losses were Kansas City ($10.9
million), Toronto ($9.5 million), Milwaukee ($8.8 million), Seattle
($8.6 million), San Diego ($8 million), the Chicago Cubs ($7.9
million), Boston ($7.6 million), Minnesota ($7.1 million), San
Francisco ($6.4 million), the New York Mets ($5.2 million), Houston
($3.7 million) and Anaheim ($200,000).
</P>
<P>
   The problem with so many teams losing money is that it has
created an ever-widening chasm between the game's haves and
have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see the disparity growing, both in terms of gross
revenue and payroll,'' baseball commissioner Bud Selig said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, disparity is the No. 1 problem we have. It's only
getting worse. It's a problem that has to be dealt with,'' Selig
said.
</P>
<P>
   Selig's comments came shortly after the Dodgers signed pitcher
Kevin Brown to a deal last December that pays Brown $15 million a
year and makes him baseball's first $100 million player.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone is accustomed to saying that the sky is falling for
baseball, but the Dodgers' deal with Brown _ plane rides home in
the Fox jet and all _ was legitimately seen as the latest, gravest
break in the economic dike.
</P>
<P>
   If Brown is worth $100 million, what is Ken Griffey Jr. worth?
What is A-Rod worth? How can the M's possibly sign one of the them,
let alone both, unless the M's are praying baseball institutes
something like a salary cap so that parity is achievable, as it is
to some degree in the NFL, the NBA and the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, when baseball can no longer provide fans and
players the hope that their team starts opening day as a contender,
the game is in serious trouble.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one has to question whether there already is something
inherently unfair about the game. The answer seems obviously
``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Alderson, baseball's new executive vice president of
operations, went so far as to propose that some small-market teams
should be up front and tell fans that their home team is merely an
entertainment product, not a competitive opponent, since there is
little hope their team will beat the Yankees, Braves or Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Seattle, where the payroll is holding at about $54
million, one wonders daily how much of the M's woes are because of
poor trades by vice president of baseball operations Woody
Woodward. And one wonders if the owners might as well spend $20
million if they aren't going to spend $80 million _ the going rate
these days for a contender.
</P>
<P>
   If the Mariners are lucky, baseball will be brought to its knees
before A-Rod's agent brings them to theirs.

HALAMA, MARINER BATS SHINE IN ROUT OF TWINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ They scored 15 runs and challenged a pair of team
records Monday night, but with the '99 Mariners, the most
significant stuff always happens on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   While 25,710 fans at the Kingdome watched the M's bash six
homers in beating the Minnesota Twins 15-5, manager Lou Piniella's
thoughts turned to his pitching staff. Five strong relief innings
from John Halama convinced him to give the rookie a chance to
start, and 21/3 erratic innings from starter Mac Suzuki convinced
him to put Suzuki, another rookie, back in long relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried to get (Halama) in the rotation, but we've only
had one left-hander in the bullpen,'' Piniella said. ``But now that
we've got (Jordan) Zimmerman, we can do something with Halama and
give him a chance to start.''
</P>
<P>
   Also moving to the rotation is Ken Cloude, who started Saturday
when Freddy Garcia had to be skipped because of a bruised shoulder.
Cloude will start Saturday in Kansas City and Halama Tuesday in
Minnesota, setting up Jamie Moyer, Cloude, Garcia, Jeff Fassero and
Halama as the Mariners' rotation when they start a six-game road
trip Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to be a starter in this game,'' said Halama, who
was supposed to start in New York May 9 but was forced into relief
instead. ``But if that doesn't happen, as long as I can contribute
and give my team some quality innings out of the pen, I'm going to
be happy with that.''
</P>
<P>
   After a home run by Edgar Martinez gave the M's a 3-0
first-inning lead, Suzuki lost it by allowing a homer on the first
pitch of the second inning and three runs on three hits in the
third.
</P>
<P>
   Halama worked out of trouble in the third, then returned to the
mound with a 7-4 lead in the fourth. A run-scoring single by Butch
Huskey and a three-run homer by Jay Buhner had given the M's a
four-run third and chased Eric Milton (1-4).
</P>
<P>
   Buhner's blast scored Martinez for the second time, and the
Mariners' designated hitter would score three more runs, tying Ken
Griffey Jr.'s single-game club record with five.
</P>
<P>
   Huskey drove in seven runs Monday, one shy of the club record
shared by Alvin Davis and Mike Blowers. He belted his first career
grand slam in the sixth, then added a two-run shot off former
Mariner Bob Wells in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   It was Huskey's first seven-RBI day at any level.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great feeling to be able to go out there and do that
when you're not playing as much as you'd like to,'' he said. ``It's
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Huskey has been caught in the Mariners' outfield crunch in
recent weeks. Since acquiring Brian Hunter _ who ``had his leg
wrapped,'' according to Piniella, and was a late scratch Monday _
to fill their long-vacant leadoff spot, the Mariners have had seven
outfielders on the roster. That has left them with only 10
pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   The M's are the only team in baseball with just 10 pitchers, and
Piniella reiterated his hope that the M's will add an 11th soon.
It's almost a necessity, as going from a four-man rotation to a
five-man rotation creates another hole in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can spot-start (Halama) from time to time against a team
that has more left-handed hitters, and use Suzuki when a team has
more right-handed hitters, and just mix and match that way,
depending on what our needs are,'' Piniella said. ``That's the
advantage of having more pitchers, especially with our staff, where
some of my starters aren't giving you innings. You can go out and
get them and put someone else in there and give yourself a chance
to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Halama left the game after a Marty Cordova bouncer nicked the
tips of his fingers. The injury was not serious, and it gave
Zimmerman a chance at his first major league outing. The
24-year-old, who was called up Sunday from Class AA New Haven,
retired both hitters he faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't nervous at all,'' said Zimmerman. ``David Segui came
over to me and said, `Is it your first time out there? Don't worry
about it _ almost all the fans have left.' After that, it didn't
bother me at all.''

HIGH COURT REJECTS STATE WELFARE LAW
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By HARRIET CHIANG 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  The U.S. Supreme Court ruled Monday that California cannot pay
lower welfare benefits to new residents, in a decision that strikes
down similar efforts across the country.
<P>
   Passed at the urging of then-Gov. Pete Wilson, the 1992 law
would have limited benefits to new arrivals to the amount they
received in their previous state, but it was never enforced because
of legal challenges. It was intended to apply during new residents'
first year in California.
</P>
<P>
   The state argued that the law would prevent California from
becoming a ``welfare magnet'' for poor people trying to take
advantage of the generous welfare program.
</P>
<P>
   The difference could be significant. The family of four from
Oklahoma that filed the suit after it moved to California in 1997
would be limited to $380 in welfare benefits, instead of $673 for
longtime residents.
</P>
<P>
   By a 7-to-2 vote, the high court declared that the statute, as
well as similar laws in at least 14 other states, is
unconstitutional because it illegally discriminates against people
who move to the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Citizens of the United States, whether rich or poor, have the
right to choose to be citizens of the state where they reside,''
wrote Justice John Paul Stevens in the court's decision. ``The
states, however, do not have any right to select their citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that ``the right to travel embraces the citizen's right
to be treated equally'' and assures new residents the same
privileges and immunities.
</P>
<P>
   The court disagreed with the Wilson administration's argument
that the law was a legitimate way of trimming its vast welfare
budget. The savings is so ``minuscule'' that it doesn't justify the
discriminatory policy, Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Social Services estimates that the law
would have saved $16 million in state and federal welfare payments
to the 68,000 families who are expected to come to California in
the 2000-2001 fiscal year. The sum is less than 6 percent of
California's total $284 million welfare budget.
</P>
<P>
   In a dissenting opinion, Chief Justice William Rehnquist said
the law is a legitimate way for the state ``to assure that only
persons who establish a bona fide residence receive the benefits
provided to current residents of the State.'' He was joined by
Justice Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came in response to a lawsuit filed on behalf of
the Oklahoma family, as well as a woman with two children from
Washington D.C., who would have received $398 instead of the $565
allowed for other California residents.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government and several states had urged the high
court to allow these limits on welfare payments.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bustamante, a spokesman for California Gov. Gray Davis,
said that Davis, who was state controller when the law passed in
1992, had supported it. But he added that Davis had prudently set
aside $10.9 million in general funds from the 1999-2000 budget to
cover the state's costs in case the law was struck down.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Rosenbaum, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union
of Southern California who argued against the law, said he was
``thrilled'' with the decision. ``It puts out the welcome mat at
every state border, rich or poor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He scoffed at the state's argument that the law would prevent
California from becoming a magnet for poor people trying to take
advantage of the generous welfare program.
</P>
<P>
   ``California has the third-highest cost of living in the
nation,'' he said. ``The welfare magnet was a myth. It was really
the other way around.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision was also closely watched by several women's groups
throughout the nation who said the laws harm victims of domestic
violence trying to escape from their abuser.
</P>
<P>
   These women, often with their children, try to get as far away
as possible from the person battering them, often moving to another
state, said Nancy Davis, executive director of the NOW Legal
Defense and Education Fund in New York, which was co-counsel in the
case along with the ACLU.
</P>
<P>
   She noted that in most of the cases challenging these laws, at
least one of the plaintiffs was a victim of domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   This decision means that ``safety can be their primary concern
rather than worrying about whether they're going to be
discriminated against,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   California's law was immediately challenged after it went into
effect. In barring its enforcement, U.S. District Judge David Levi
of Sacramento ruled that the statute was unconstitutional if it was
intended to discourage poor people from moving to the state. Even
if it was a cost-saving measure, he said, the state failed to show
why the whole burden should fall on newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   California may have one of the most generous welfare programs,
but it also has a higher cost of living than 43 other states, Levi
said.
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court upheld Levi's decision.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1996 federal welfare reform plan passed Congress, Levi
extended his order against the state, saying the federal bill
didn't affect his legal analysis.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 welfare law specifically allowed states to provide
lower benefits to new residents on a short-term basis. But the high
court said that Congress cannot pass laws in violation of the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The equal protection clause of the Constitution ``does not
tolerate a hierarchy of subclasses of similarly situated citizens
based on the location of their prior residences,'' wrote Stevens.

 &HT;    New camera simplifies taking good pictures
 &HT;    EDS: RESENDING FOR THOSE WHO NEED IT.
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ If you were lucky enough to give birth on
Mother's Day, the coincidence probably made an already magical
event even more special.
</P>
<P>
   The people at Kodak want to help you celebrate the occasion by
sending you a free camera to capture images of the new addition to
your family.
</P>
<P>
   And the camera they're offering is one of the sweetest little
gadgets I've seen in years. Kodak sent a sample of its Advantix
T550 camera, and I took it along on a recent assignment to cover
the Star Wars Celebration in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The camera is incredibly simple to use, it takes good pictures
under a variety of conditions, it's smaller than a pack of
cigarettes and about as lightweight, and it takes pictures in three
formats: classic, group and panoramic.
</P>
<P>
   The camera uses drop-in Advantix film cartridges. To load, you
flip a switch and a port pops open. Drop the cartridge into place
and the camera threads itself and sets up for the first picture.
</P>
<P>
   The camera has automatic focus features and allows distant shots
or close-ups from as near as 16 inches. The built-in flash also is
automatic and has red-eye reduction circuitry.
</P>
<P>
   The T550 can be set to stamp the time and date automatically on
the backs of prints. It also comes with special-occasion captions
such as birthday or vacation that can be automatically stamped on
pictures.
</P>
<P>
   The T550 doesn't have the flexibility of more complicated
cameras. It doesn't have shutter speed or aperture adjustments, for
example, and it can't zoom in and out to get close-ups from a
distance or wide-angle shots.
</P>
<P>
   But for photographers who are intimidated by complexity, it's a
capable device.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bit expensive, however. The T550 package offered to
mothers has a roll of film with free processing, a battery and a
coupon for a free picture CD and has a value of $150, according to
Kodak.
</P>
<P>
   Processing also is a bit pricey. To get double prints on a roll
of 15 shots cost me about $9, including an index print.
</P>
<P>
   If you didn't give birth on Mother's Day, and you're interested
in buying the camera, it is a new model that is still difficult to
find. Keep an eye on the camera departments of department stores,
discount stores and electronic retailers for the T550 and similar
models. You're less likely to find Advantix cameras in photographic
specialty stores.
</P>
<P>
   Free camera for giving birth on Mother's Day
</P>
<P>
   If you had a baby May 9 or adopted May 10, you can receive a
free T550 camera. Send a certified copy of the newborn's birth
certificate or adoption papers to Kodak Advantix Picture Perfect

   &UR; Even now, 51 years later, Milt Schmidt, Woody Dumart, Pat Egan,
Fernie Flaman, and their Boston Bruin teammates don't know some of
the most basic details of the National Hockey League's greatest
gambling scandal. Two Bruins on the 1947-48 team were barred for
life for betting on a Boston game in Chicago Stadium on Feb. 18,
1948, the only NHL players ever handed hockey's death sentence for
gambling. Now, the scandal's full story is told, in a three-part
series by Globe sportswriter Michael Madden.

</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- In the annals of the National Hockey League, few games
can match the Boston-Toronto contest in Maple Leaf Gardens Nov. 27,
1943, for bizarreness. It also demonstrated how flagrant gambling
was in the league at the time, particularly by Toronto's Babe
Pratt, who would be MVP of the NHL that season.
</P>
<P>
   World War II had ravaged the rosters of all teams except the
Montreal Canadiens (Quebec had voted against universal
conscription). Boston's goalie was veteran Bert Gardiner, whom many
of his ex-teammates described as an alcoholic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gardiner would walk into mirrors (in hotels),'' said Don
Gallinger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a goalie with the DTs,'' is how Bep Guidolin put it.
</P>
<P>
   Gardiner had started the 1943-44 season poorly. A week before
the game in Toronto, he gave up 13 goals to the Canadiens, an NHL
record at the time.
</P>
<P>
   When the team boarded its train at South Station for Toronto,
Bruins players recalled, coach Art Ross smelled alcohol on
Gardiner's breath and angrily threw him off the train. The problem
was, when the Bruins arrived in Toronto, the team had no goalie;
teams did not carry spare goaltenders then.
</P>
<P>
   Ross asked his friends in Toronto for suggestions, and the
goalie he found was George Abbott, a 47-year-old minister who had
some amateur experience. When Boston trainer Win Green answered a
knock at the door of the locker room, he saw an aging man who said
he was the Bruins' goalie for the game that night. Green threw him
out, saying, ``What's going on here?''
</P>
<P>
   It got worse. Abbott was so nervous, Bruins players recalled,
that he began to put his skates on the wrong feet. After he finally
dressed, he was so anxious to go on the ice that he opened the door
and went into the crowded lobby of Maple Leaf Gardens, clomping
about among the fans.
</P>
<P>
   In warmups, Bruins players lobbed their softest shots at Abbott,
but the pucks would be in the net before he moved his glove or
stick. Watching all this was Pratt, the star defenseman of the
Maple Leafs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a betting ring at Maple Leaf Gardens then, up on the
top floor,'' said defenseman Pat Egan, who joined the Bruins later
that season. ``That was well known; you could bet on anything you
wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened next soon became lore. As Egan recalled the story
as told to him, Pratt returned to his locker room, ``takes his
skates off, puts on his overcoat over his uniform and goes upstairs
and bets $500 on the Maple Leafs.''
</P>
<P>
   Toronto won the game, 7-4. Newspapers back in Boston reported
that ``Gardiner had been stricken with influenza,'' forcing the
Bruins to use ``a rookie netminder.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that season, Abbott wrote a letter to Ross asking for a
second chance; the Maple Leafs, for their part, offered to pay
Abbott's expenses to Boston. Alas, Abbott's career in the NHL
lasted just that one game.

<P>
   Tamer also had been a suspect in the 1937 Thanksgiving Day
barroom slaying of Harry Millman, a member of Detroit's notorious
Purple Gang that refused to turn over to mobsters its proceeds from
various rackets. Tamer's name also had been mentioned in connection
with the 1945 murder of Michigan State Sen. Warren G. Hooper. But
he was not charged in either murder.
</P>
<P>
   Tamer's parole term was about to expire, on Feb. 29, 1948. Both
the Detroit police and Michigan parole officials thus intensified
their investigation of Tamer and focused their attention on his bar
at 543 Woodward Avenue in downtown Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Police installed an illegal wiretap, a listening device that
used copper wire instead of the tape recordings that are common
today. Bourke had been monitoring Tamer's activities since January
1947, along with Michigan Liquor Control Commission investigators,
in an attempt to uncover the gangsters' hidden ownership of Detroit
bars. Bourke also was interested in Tamer's bookmaking, numbers,
and any other activities of the man soon to be known as ``Detroit's
No. 1 gangster.''
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 18, 1948, the bombshell fell. Police eavesdropped on a
phone call to Detroit from Chicago by a man wishing to bet on the
Chicago-Boston hockey game. After that call, police were more
amazed when a call was placed from Tamer's bar to a hotel in New
York City, a person-to-person call, apparently to Billy Taylor, now
of the New York Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Taylor also would like to bet on the Black Hawks to beat
the Bruins. A $500 bet.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after the phone calls, the puck was dropped for the
opening faceoff at Chicago Stadium. Egan, as he always did in
Chicago, skated over to Black Hawks star Doug Bentley the first
chance he got and pointed to the Indian on Bentley's sweater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just to get him mad,'' said Egan, ``we'd say, `Hey, Bentley!
Is that your picture on the sweater?' Because he had a nose on him,
a bloody nose, and he'd go on a spree.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly what Gallinger expected. In Gallinger's mind,
Chicago always started fast in the first period, with Bentley
leading the way, ``and we always seemed to be down, 2-0, after the
first period.''
</P>
<P>
   The Black Hawks, as Gallinger expected, quickly scored first, as
Gus Bodnar tallied after 6:21 of play. But a minute later Dumart
whipped an unassisted goal past young Chicago goalie Emile ``The
Cat'' Francis. Former Bruin and Maple Leaf Roy Conacher next beat
Brimsek with a 60-foot backhander to give Chicago the lead, 2-1, at
10:03. But Grant ``Knobby'' Warwick tied it again late in the
period.
</P>
<P>
   For Gallinger, and for Taylor 900 miles away in New York,
Warwick's goal was a most painful irony. It was Warwick who had
come from the Rangers two weeks earlier in the trade for Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game starts and, all of a sudden, we're not dominating the
game,'' is Gallinger's recollection.
</P>
<P>
   But, he went on, ``I knew that wasn't safe because of the way
the game was blowing. Because when that Bentley line flies in the
first period, they win the game by the first period with two or
three goals and then you have a hell of an uphill battle against
that line and the rest fall in and they're hard to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   In Gallinger's memory of the game that changed his life, he was
thinking in the second period, ``I don't like the way the game is
flowing. And now when the second period ends, it's 2-2, so we've
come back since the first period.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, his memory is incorrect. The Bruins had taken a 3-2
lead by the end of the second. Gallinger's memory is even more awry
when he recalls the third period.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, we go into the third period and that thing stayed tied
until about the eight- or nine-minute mark to go,'' said Gallinger,
``and then I broke over the center ice line and I fed a pass to the
winning goal, and we move ahead, 3-2.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, rookie Ed Sandford had given the Bruins the lead on an
assist from Dumart at 16:37 of the second period. And the Bruins'
final goal of the game came with less than two minutes left, when
Dumart took a pass from Sandford and beat Francis.
</P>
<P>
   Very few of the Bruins who played in this game can remember many
details. Sandford, for instance, had replaced the injured Schmidt
as the center of the top line, ``but I don't remember anything
about the game,'' he said. Dumart, for his part, can remember
little of it except, ``I scored two goals.''
</P>
<P>
   There is one thing, though, that all the Bruins remember: They
won the game, 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never felt anything,'' claimed Gallinger. ``All I knew was
what was happening, that I was losing $1,500 or $3,000. And, before
that game was over, I sat on that bench and I said, `Gallinger, you
can be as hard-nosed as any sonofabitch. You've seen a lot of
hard-nosers in your life and now maybe it's your turn to be
hard-nosed.' ''
</P>
<P>
   At game's end, Gallinger skated behind the goal to the door that
led down the steps to the basement of Chicago Stadium and into the
locker room. By the time he reached the locker room, Gallinger had
made up his mind. He was not going to pay Tamer the $1,500 he had
lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I blew that goddamned bet,'' said Gallinger. I said, `If I
don't give them the damned money, then it's always in my bank
account or in my pocket.' And I said, `Gallinger, this may be the
greatest lesson you've ever learned and you surely don't ever want
to do it again.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And I did it. I've never paid that wager to this day.''
</P>
<P>
   The players dressed. A pleased Dit Clapper, the coach, conducted
his usual postgame ritual after road games, giving $4 each to the
four ``cab captains,'' who had the responsibility of corraling
three other players to share a cab.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you what happened after that game in Chicago, and
this is all I remember of it,'' said the Bruins' Kenny Smith.
``Galley and (Paul) Ronty and (John) Peirson all came back from
Chicago Stadium in the same cab with me. I was the cab captain. And
I remember Galley said we had to stop, that, `I've got to make a
phone call.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Smith distinctly recalled Gallinger hurrying into the LaSalle
Hotel as the others waited outside. Gallinger returned ``and he
never said anything (about the call) to us,'' said Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Was he calling Taylor in New York for advice on what to do?
</P>
<P>
   Gallinger said he did not remember making a call after the game.
</P>
<P>
   The game the Boston Bruins won.
</P>
<P>
   The game Don Gallinger lost.

UNLUCKY BETTOR IS TAPPED OUT 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- At 11 o'clock on the morning of Feb. 25, 1948, the
Bruins' Don Gallinger was back in his childhood hometown of Port
Colborne, Ontario. When the Bruins were in to play the Maple Leafs,
Gallinger always left Toronto for a visit home, a mere two hours
away.
</P>
<P>
   Gallinger was downtown in the Victoria Sweets Shop, drinking a
soda and schmoozing with old pals still impressed with stories
about life in the National Hockey League. Port Colborne seldom sent
any boys to the NHL, but now this town of 11,000 or so had two _
and two good ones at that: Gallinger, a star with the Bruins; and
Ted Kennedy, the tough, driving force of Ontario's joy, the Maple
Leafs.
</P>
<P>
   The pride of the town couldn't be greater. Wasn't it just a
while back that Maple Leaf Gardens held a ``Port Colborne Night''
for a Bruins-Maple Leafs game and presented Gallinger and Kennedy
with expensive watches? Gallinger would keep that watch in its
satin-lined case for a half-century, treasuring it.
</P>
<P>
   Gallinger had almost _ but not quite _ forgotten about the
$1,500 bet he had made a week earlier in Chicago, betting on his
own team to lose to the Black Hawks. Gallinger had been positive
the Bruins would lose; instead, they won, 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   Gallinger's mind was not wracked by ethical debates; his
thinking was merely that he had made a bad bet. Gallinger was a
gambler, and, as all gamblers learn, bad bets are made from time to
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at it as if a tout had given me a horse at a race
track,'' Gallinger would say, ``and I had bet on the horse. And the
horse didn't win.''
</P>
<P>
   His concern was not that the bet had been made, but with his
decision that he would not pay the $1,500 to James Tamer, the
Detroit bookie and gangster who had taken the wager. There might be
problems on the Bruins' next visit to Detroit. For sure, Billy
Taylor, the former Bruin now with the New York Rangers, would be
hounding Gallinger to pay Tamer. It was Taylor who had first
broached the subject of betting on Bruins games with Gallinger in
1947, and Taylor who had introduced Gallinger to Tamer.
</P>
<P>
   After the Bruins had won _ and Gallinger had lost _ in Chicago,
the Bruins took the long train ride to Montreal and dispatched the
Canadiens Saturday night in the Forum, 3-1. The Bruins hastily but
happily left the Forum after the game for their Pullman car parked
in the Montreal rail yards and headed south for a Sunday night game
in New York, where the Rangers beat them, 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   On the next day, the Bruins again were headed north, this time
to Toronto and, as usual, Boston general manager Art Ross allowed
any of his players from the Toronto area to go home.
</P>
<P>
   It was a Wednesday morning when Gallinger was in the Victoria
Sweets Shop, exactly one week after he had made his bet in Chicago.
If there was one thing about that bet of which Gallinger was
certain, it was that no one would ever know he had made it except
he and the man who took it, Tamer. Gallinger had gone over the
phone call in his mind time and again, and he was positive he had
hidden his identity.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Doan walked into the coffee shop at the corner of King and
Clarence streets. When they were boyhood chums, Doan remembered,
Gallinger ``was a great gambler even then.''
</P>
<P>
   Doan was working for the electric company reading meters that
morning, he recalled, ``and I came into the Victoria. Galley used
to hang there. And that's where I gave him the news. I was the
first one to tell him.''
</P>
<P>
   Doan said he told Gallinger, `` `I heard it on the radio, about
these fellows caught gambling in the NHL,' '' adding that the story
had come out of Detroit. ``He said he didn't know anything about
it. He seemed surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He said something about gambling in the NHL,'' recalled
Gallinger recently from his one-room apartment in Burlington,
Ontario. ``And I said, `Can you define it?' ''
</P>
<P>
   What followed were words that shocked Gallinger.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just said there was some sort of big gambler in Detroit who
had been caught on wiretap and they didn't have too much to say
other than there was gambling in the National Hockey League.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it all came together for Gallinger. His mother had told him
just before he headed downtown that an urgent call had come from
Ross at the Royal York Hotel in Toronto. The message was that all
players were to report to Ross's suite as soon as possible. And
Gallinger was told _ no, ordered _ to take the next train to
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Gallinger had not known what to make of this message.
</P>
<P>
   Now he did.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Detroit, on that same morning, Tamer was four days away from
total freedom. On March 1, his parole for a bank-robbery conviction
in 1934 would be expired and the Michigan Parole Board would no
longer be able to use its extraordinary powers to yank him off the
street on any pretense, such as ``associating with disreputable
characters,'' and send him back to the state prison.
</P>
<P>
   Also in Detroit that morning, the Red Wings were practicing at
the Olympia, but few minds were on hockey. The newspapers screamed
in end-the-world-sized headlines, ``Hockey Probes `Fix' Rumors,''
and every newscast on every radio station was reporting the
shocking news. The story had been leaked by a Detroit policeman to
a reporter, though which teams or players were involved was not
revealed.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Adams, general manager of the Red Wings, had called every
player into his office and asked them, ``Did you bet on a hockey
game?'' Clarence Campbell, the NHL president, had sent urgent word
from Montreal for all teams to question all players. The NHL had
little or no security apparatus then; the questioning would be done
by general managers and coaches.
</P>
<P>
   More than a few players immediately suspected at least one
possible culprit. And right there in Detroit, as the Red Wings
practiced, they talked among themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Bep Guidolin, who had been traded from the Bruins to Detroit for
Taylor at the start of that season, recalled, ``Guys were saying,
`Betcha Billy's involved, betcha Billy's involved.' Billy, you
know, bet on horses, racetracks, knew some bookmakers, he has that
pool room in Oshawa.''
</P>
<P>
   Guidolin was friends with Billy Taylor, had been in the same
Canadian Army barracks in Newmarket, Ontario, with Taylor during
World War II, had listened to Taylor tell of his gambling tales
during those boring Army days. But Guidolin's closest friend in the
NHL was Gallinger, his former teammate with the Bruins, and
Guidolin felt his stomach sink when he heard the gambling reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were skating around the ice, nobody ever mentioned
Galley's name to me,'' said Guidolin. ``Now, I'm the only guy who
knew Galley, and I never said a word. I just said to myself,
`Please, God, don't let Galley be involved. Please, God.' Galley
needed the dough, and he liked to bet.''
</P>
<P>
   After practice, Guidolin headed home to his wife, Ellie, a
former skater in ice shows. It had been Gallinger who introduced
Guidolin to Ellie back in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got home and I asked my wife, `Did you hear the news?' ''
recalled Guidolin.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, she had.
</P>
<P>
   Both feared the worst.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gallinger got a ride to Welland, Ontario, the next town over
from Port Colborne, but not before buying the paper. The train to
Toronto left from Welland and, by the time it pulled out, Gallinger
had virtually memorized the newspaper story. His mind was racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time I got to Toronto,'' recalled Gallinger, ``I'd had
time to think. I had a chance to think about everything I'd read in
that paper and, then, all of a sudden, I said, `Well, there's no
proof I can be tied to this evidence in any way, shape, or form.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Gallinger played over and over in his mind the call to Tamer to
make the bet. He was positive he could not be identified, wiretap
or no wiretap. Tamer, the gangster, surely would not talk to
police, Gallinger reasoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that always crossed my mind was the only person
who could involve me in this was Billy Taylor,'' said Gallinger.
``And I said to myself, `Billy Taylor would never do that; he'd be
double-barreling himself. He'd be only putting himself in deeper.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Gallinger's mind was made up by the time he arrived in Toronto.
He would deny all.
</P>
<P>
   As the Bruins gathered in the foyer of Ross's suite at the Royal
York Hotel, the players also had their suspects. And the name of
Don Gallinger was prominent.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Pat Egan, for one, thought back to Gallinger's many
gambling incidents, from placing bets with the bull gang at Boston
Garden, to ``the next thing, Gallinger starts taking the bets and
covering them himself'' in the locker room on races at Suffolk
Downs and Rockingham Park, to myriad card games. Egan, like all the
Bruins, mentally went up and down the roster for possible suspects.
</P>
<P>
   All the youngsters _ such as Ed Sandford, Paul Ronty, Ed
Harrison, and John Peirson _ were immediately cleared, as were
Woody Dumart and Milt Schmidt, players beyond reproach on and off
the ice, and goalie Frankie Brimsek.
</P>
<P>
   Many Bruins, though, would come back to one teammate: Don
Gallinger.
</P>
<P>
   As the players waited to be questioned, Gallinger arrived, and
he recalled defenseman Johnny Crawford saying to him, `` `Galley,
aren't you going to put an end to all this? Where's it all going to
end?' Crawford would say, `Galley, it's got to be you. You're the
only man who would do something like this.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Peters had been with the Bruins only two months, but he
spoke his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all looking at each other,'' Peters recalled. ``I can
remember telling Don Gallinger, `I'm going in there to tell the
truth and you'd better go in there and you better tell the truth,
too.' I was mad. I can remember that to the very end of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the players entered the suite, they were met by Ross, the
stern general manager himself, as well as coach Dit Clapper and
Harold ``Baldy'' Cotton, the chief scout who had signed many of
them. Ross knew enough to immediately dismiss some players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember going into the room like it was yesterday,''
said Sandford, a rookie that season. ``Ross said, `You don't know
anything about this guy (Tamer), do you? I hope you don't, but if
you do, you'd better let me know.' I said, `Mr. Ross, I don't know
what anybody is talking about. I have no knowledge of this.' And he
said, `Get the hell out of here.' ''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Other players have similar memories, though a few don't remember
the questioning at all. Gallinger remembers Ross, Clapper, and
Cotton ``sitting in three chairs in a little semicircle,'' and
``once I got in there, Ross took over.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallinger had worked out his plan. He would admit only what any
witness might corroborate and deny everything else. Gallinger knew
he could not deny meeting Tamer because teammate Wally Wilson had
been present in Detroit when Gallinger and Tamer talked three weeks
earlier. Also, Gallinger and Taylor had met Tamer much earlier in
the season at a nightclub outside Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Gallinger recalled telling Ross, `` `Yes, I met that man only
once. You say, Do I know him? No, I don't know him. I met the man
only once after a game in Detroit when (Taylor) took me out in the
country some 25 miles to a dance hall, and Taylor introduced him to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   This seems perplexing, though, since Taylor's name apparently
had not been brought up in the scandal yet, so Gallinger, in
effect, would be telling the NHL that Taylor also knew Tamer.
</P>
<P>
   Gallinger denied any more involvement. When he left Ross's
suite, he recalled, ``I felt relieved. I was in my pattern of
control. Nobody was ever going to control me, to get any knowledge
from me. I knew what I was going to say and not going to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallinger also recalled thinking, `` `I wonder if there is
anybody (else) on this club who might be involved.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The man had bet against his own team a week earlier. Now he was
searching for phantom conspirators. And so it would go for a
half-century.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The NHL was in chaos. The Bruins were in chaos. Gangsters in
Detroit were in chaos (hundreds of them would be cleared from the
streets in the next few days). Detroit and Michigan politicians
were in chaos. And Don Gallinger's mind was in chaos.
</P>
<P>
   That night, the Bruins lost in Toronto, 4-2. After the game,
back in the Royal York Hotel, Gallinger noticed something strange.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Assistant trainer) Hammie Moore was my roommate that night,''
said Gallinger. ``They put Hammie Moore in with me to be a mole. He
was spying on me on behalf of the club.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallinger could not sleep that night, and he would not sleep for
many more nights, he said. So he clearly heard the phone ring at
2:30 in the morning and heard Moore take the call from Clapper, the
coach. Ross wanted to talk to Gallinger _ now.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Gallinger recalled, Ross was not asking questions but
making accusations. Ross ``had some scotch in him,'' said
Gallinger, and was confrontational. Ross accused Gallinger of
betting on hockey games. Gallinger continued to deny all.
</P>
<P>
   Weston Adams, the Bruins owner, flew out to try to get to the
bottom of this chaos. Campbell, the NHL president, traveled to
Detroit, where police briefed him. Still, no players had been
named. No teams, either. Rumors were rampant.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' final game of the five-game trip was on Sunday
night, Feb. 29, back in Chicago, the scene of the crime. The
players were grilled. Adams and Clapper questioned operators at the
LaSalle Hotel about calls that might have been made 10 days earlier
by hockey players. Hotel officials, maids, and other workers were
queried about anything that might have been the slightest bit
unusual during Boston's previous visit.
</P>
<P>
   By now, reports from Detroit indicated that unidentified players
on the Bruins and Rangers were involved. A Toronto newspaper
reported that a member of the Black Hawks was involved. Facts,
though, were scarce.
</P>
<P>
   Adams and Clapper were able to track down the operator who had
placed calls to Detroit on Feb. 17 and 18, but she could not
identify the caller as a hockey player. Clapper said he would go to
Detroit to help police identify the voices on the wiretaps.
</P>
<P>
   Gallinger recalled ``a two-man personal meeting'' with Ross in
Chicago at which Ross became very emotional, saying how he had
helped found the Bruins, how he had spent 25 years of his life with
the Bruins, how the Bruins meant so much to him, and how it would
break his heart if any Bruin had bet on games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ross said he would quit forever the National Hockey League if
this was true,'' Gallinger recalled. ``And I believed him.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Gallinger also saw this as a ploy by Ross, a counterpoint to
the confrontational approach four days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Still, said Gallinger, ``I came within an inch of confessing,''
and he would have ``if he had made a statement of what he was
prepared to do for me,'' in terms of possibly a short suspension.
``But he never opened the final door.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, though, Gallinger's memory may be mistaken. Ross had
fallen ill in Toronto, returned home to Boston, and did not
accompany the team to Chicago. But the words Gallinger claims Ross
spoke to him in that private meeting in Chicago _ about quitting
the league if the allegations were true _ actually appeared in
print, as told by Ross to reporters in Toronto. John Ross, Art's
son, remembered his father as being ``very quiet'' during these
days. Others go further, saying this incident broke Ross's heart.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins finally returned home after the two-week trip. The
pressure was enormous in Boston and throughout the NHL, but facts
still were scant. Michigan officials now denied there had been a
wiretap on Tamer's phone, possibly because it was illegal.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, March 2, Gallinger recalled, he was playing a
friendly game of cards in his room at Ruthie Hatch's boardinghouse
in the Back Bay when he received a call from a sometimes-tout and
sometimes-friend of Bruins players who had hung around the dressing
room. The man instructed Gallinger to come to his apartment near
Kenmore Square.
</P>
<P>
   When he reached the apartment, Gallinger said, the man told him
that Taylor had called from New York, that his message to Gallinger
was to stay mum, that Taylor was not going to talk, and that if no
one talked, no one in the NHL could prove anything. Gallinger left
that meeting more determined to deny everything, even though later
that night he was summoned to Ross's Chestnut Hill home and again
accused of gambling.
</P>
<P>
   The next night, the Bruins were back in the Garden, again
playing Chicago, and 13,909 fans shouted their backing of the
beleaguered team, which had Schmidt, their captain, back for the
first time in five weeks. The game ended in a 4-4 tie. Gamblers
continued to prowl the East Lobby of the Garden before the game,
not scared off by the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   As the Bruins left for Montreal the next day, a Thursday, they
learned that Campbell would be in Boston over the weekend to
question the team personally. First, he would be in New York
Saturday to grill the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Walter Winchell, one of America's most famous
columnists and broadcasters, was prepared to write in a New York
newspaper and repeat on his national radio show that he had learned
the identities of hockey's gamblers _ one a Bruin and one a Ranger.
Their initials, Winchell reported, were ``B.T.'' and ``D.G.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt vividly recalled what happened when the Bruins left the
Montreal Forum, after a 1-1 tie, and headed to their train.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little cliques (of players) had been forming and they'd say,
`Do you think it was Galley?' and `Do you think Galley did this?'
But nothing was definite then,'' said Schmidt. ``You couldn't point
a guilty finger at him. You didn't really know, in all honesty.''
</P>
<P>
   But soon after the team boarded, Schmidt recalled, a group of
players was in the smoking car and one picked up a New York Mirror
with Winchell's column.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember one of the players showing it to Galley and
yelling,'' said Schmidt. ``There was an awful loud voice by Don
Gallinger then as to how he was going to sue (Winchell).''
</P>
<P>
   Egan recalled that he was the player shouting at Gallinger.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were 10 of us in the smoking car,'' recalled Egan.
``This (expletive) Gallinger is sitting right there and Milt and
somebody else said something (about Winchell's identification) and
he turns the color of that (red) flower. And I said, `Don, if
you're not guilty, then you're a millionaire because you can sue
that damned Winchell for everything he's got.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `It's not me; damn it, you know it's not me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, March 6, 1948, Clarence Campbell arrived in Boston
with the ostensible smoking gun in his briefcase: transcriptions of
wiretapped conversations between two hockey players and Tamer, the
Detroit bookmaker. The problem for the NHL president was finding
the triggerman. Taylor had not been forthcoming in New York that
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor had yet to play a home game at Madison Square Garden for
the Rangers after his trade a month earlier from Boston; he never
would.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell had sent word ahead to Ross that he wanted to speak to
six players: star forward Dumart, rookie forward Wilson, young
forward Kenny Smith, veteran forward Peters, defenseman Egan, and
forward Gallinger, the Bruins' budding star.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was furious that Campbell had called me up to that hotel
room,'' said Dumart, still angry some 51 years after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Egan was more irate. He immediately told Campbell that he was
insulted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I know nothing about this, and I'm disappointed in
you that you didn't realize from the way I played the game, that if
a guy came up to me and asked me to throw a game, he'd either kick
the (expletive) out of me or I would kick it out of him.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Peters earlier had told Ross that he had met Tamer, and Ross
clearly passed the information to Campbell. All Peters could
remember of his meeting with Campbell was that ``I wasn't in there
too long; he asked what did I know and I said, `I don't know
anything.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Smith does not remember being called in by Campbell. Wilson, who
is dead, most likely was questioned because Gallinger had told
Bruins management about a meeting in a Detroit bar with Tamer at
which Wilson was present.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, recalled Peters, was shaken by the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember we were in Ruthie Hatch's boardinghouse and I
found Wally Wilson in his bed, crying,'' said Peters. ``I said,
`Wally, what's the problem?' and Wally said, `They're accusing me
of this gambling thing.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The final Bruin to be called was Gallinger, who had rehearsed
his words, his strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Gallinger said he would know ``from the very first question
Clarence Campbell asked of me whether he had the goods on me.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure was on Campbell. The very reason he was in that
hotel room was because the NHL had whitewashed a burgeoning
gambling scandal involving the Maple Leafs two years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Mervyn ``Red'' Dutton, Campbell's predecessor as NHL president,
had expelled Toronto star Walter ``Babe'' Pratt for ``conduct
detrimental to hockey,'' stating that Pratt had ignored warnings to
cease his gambling.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The expulsion caused an uproar throughout Canada, particularly
in Toronto, where newspapers defended Pratt by saying that he was
far from alone in being an NHL gambler.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL president was fighting a losing battle, especially
against the Maple Leafs, the jewel team, and their powerful general
manager, Conn Smythe.
</P>
<P>
   After being out of hockey for all of 16 days, Pratt was
reinstated. By the start of the next season, Campbell would be NHL
president and Pratt would be traded to the Bruins, where he would
play with Gallinger for 31 games of the 1946-47 season before being
sent to the minors. He eventually would be voted into the NHL Hall
of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   No news organization attempted to delve into the extent of
betting by Pratt and other Maple Leafs. Neither did the NHL. It
would not be until decades later that books published in Canada
alleged that not only Pratt, but also Billy Taylor, Ted Kennedy and
possibly other Leafs had been betting.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As Gallinger recalled the meeting, which lasted more than two
hours, Campbell said that because he had already admitted meeting
Tamer, that was reason enough for punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Mr. Campbell, this is a flimsy piece of evidence,' ''
Gallinger said. ``All players rub shoulders with these types of
characters.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Gallinger, Campbell said to him, `` `If it isn't
you (on the wiretap), then who is it?' I said, `That's not fair and
I don't like it. I don't know who it is and I don't care who it is,
but it isn't me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   As the meeting was ending, Campbell opened the door and told
Gallinger he would be suspended from hockey indefinitely _ for
associating with a gambler, not for betting on a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I said, `It's still not fair,' '' said Gallinger. ``And he
said, `That's the way it'll be.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gallinger said he left the Statler Hotel and headed immediately
to Ruthie Hatch's boardinghouse on Bay State Road. He said was
thinking of committing suicide by jumping into the Charles River.
</P>
<P>
   But, in fact, Gallinger went to Boston Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember that.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he played against the Maple Leafs that Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember that.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he played his last game ever in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember that.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he scored a goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember that.''
</P>
<P>
   Several teammates recalled him scoring a goal that night, but as
nemesis-to-be Schmidt put it, Gallinger most likely played extra
hard precisely because it was his last chance to shine.
</P>
<P>
   If, said Schmidt, he had known that night what had been said
between Gallinger and Campbell that afternoon and what Gallinger
had done two weeks earlier in Chicago, Gallinger would never had
gotten out of the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be telling you the truth if I didn't say I felt
betrayed and angry due to the fact we were giving every ounce of
blood we have, every ounce of sweat, trying to win a hockey game,''
said Schmidt, ``and two of your teammates are betting against you.
But we never knew the details for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have killed him if I had known for sure,'' said Egan.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Gallinger does not remember playing that final game,
he still insists that sometime that night he thought of jumping off
a Charles River bridge. He said his life was saved by Ruthie Hatch,
who ran the boardinghouse where he lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``She talked me out of anything desperate,'' he said. ``She said
she had noticed how determined I was on the ice and she said, `You
can carry that determination from hockey to the rest of your life.
I said, `I'll keep that with me the rest of my life.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Gallinger was summoned by Ross to the Bruins'
offices and informed him that ``a phone call from Detroit'' had
been received there. The message was that Gallinger had better pay
the money he owed to a certain someone in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Ross' heart was crushed. And Ross knew deep in that broken heart
that he might have had a role in this, that he had brought Taylor
and Pratt to his Bruins, one a known gambler and the other a
suspended gambler. Ross's blood rival was Toronto's Connie Smythe.
The two despised each other, and each was keen on proving he was a
smarter hockey man. Smythe had dumped Pratt and Taylor, and Ross
apparently thought he would prove Smythe wrong for giving up on the
two; instead it was Ross who was burned by Smythe's rejects.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Gallinger began the long drive back to Ontario,
and Campbell announced that Taylor had been barred from hockey for
life and Gallinger suspended indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next 50 years were bitter, painful, and brutal for
Gallinger, who now lives as a virtual recluse, his family, his
fortune, and his future gone.
</P>
<P>
   First, he worked at a miniature golf course in Port Colborne. He
had had baseball tryouts with both the Red Sox and Boston Braves in
1946, and he wrote to baseball commissioner Happy Chandler, but
baseball, like hockey, would have no part of a suspended gambler.
</P>
<P>
   In time, he would confess to Campbell the full details of what
happened in Chicago on Feb. 18, 1948, but Campbell did nothing.
Then he went to Smythe and poured out his soul for hours. To no
avail.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly there was a double standard in hockey, as Smythe's Pratt
had been suspended for only 16 days for his gambling, and Gallinger
had no hope. And all the NHL could prove was that he had associated
with James Tamer.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly _ very briefly _ Gallinger coached a junior hockey team
in Ontario. When the team traveled to Sarnia, in Western Ontario,
for its first game, the opposing coach pulled his team from the ice
in protest. And the Ontario Hockey Association backed him up.
</P>
<P>
   In time, Gallinger's roadblock would be as much Ross as anyone
in the NHL, in terms of reinstatement. Ross was broken-hearted by
Gallinger's betrayal of his beloved Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in 1970, Smythe gave the go-ahead to Campbell to show
leniency. Smythe had met Taylor at a banquet in Oshawa, felt sorry
for his former player, and suggested that Campbell lift the
lifetime ban. And if Taylor were reinstated, Gallinger would have
to be, too.
</P>
<P>
   But no one knew where Gallinger was. He had been selling shirts
in the Toronto area, but it was believed that he had left for
California. Campbell rather coldly said it was of no concern to him
that Gallinger could not be found for the NHL to personally deliver
the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can read about it in the paper,'' said Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   In time, Taylor would be hired as a scout by Pittsburgh, and
Schmidt would hire Taylor as a scout for the Washington expansion
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always liked Billy,'' Schmidt said. ``I was also always very
careful to keep a close eye on Billy's expense sheets.''
</P>
<P>
   But Schmidt would not hire Gallinger, neither in Boston nor in
Washington, and friction between the two grew.
</P>
<P>
   All this time, Taylor would never publicly discuss what he had
done, and the NHL would never disclose what Taylor and Gallinger
had done to warrant expulsion. All this time, many of the Bruins of
1947-48 never knew exactly what their two disgraced teammates had
done, not even knowing whether they had bet on the Bruins to win or
the Bruins to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Months before Taylor died eight years ago, recalled Peters, ``We
gave Billy a jacket from the (NHL) alumni group. And Billy was so
happy to get that jacket.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallinger, now estranged from his family and from life, is still
attempting to cash in on the bet he made in Chicago 51 years ago,
the bet he lost, the bet he never paid. He is looking for a book on
his life, a reward for his humiliation. ``There's big money to be
made,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tamer is still alive. Within days of the disclosure of the
wiretap that caught Gallinger's bet, Tamer was returned to prison
and served nine more years. He was released in 1957, but less than
a year later was arrested again, this time in Terre Haute, Ind., on
federal income tax charges. He was sentenced to five years for
evading taxes on a betting syndicate.
</P>
<P>
   Tamer was arrested again in 1966 on contempt charges for
refusing to answer questions before a grand jury in Michigan
investigating Mafia leaders in the Detroit area. In 1978, he was
arrested by the FBI in Las Vegas as part of a conspiracy to
illegally run the Aladdin Hotel. He was found guilty in 1979, and
in 1980, the Nevada Gaming Commission asked federal officials to
keep Tamer, then free on bail, out of Las Vegas and away from
negotiations to sell the Aladdin. Tamer served his sentence at a
federal facility in Florida, and while there, he and several others
bought the Hillcrest Country Club in Mt. Clemens, Mich., for about
$6.5 million in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Tamer was asked to give his recollections of the
hockey scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a long time ago,'' said Tamer, now 87 and still working
at his golf club in Mt. Clemens, some 30 miles north of Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Tamer declined to reminisce, saying, ``Be careful
what you write about me.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But three other men were very precise in what they wished to
say. In Barrie, Ontario, Bep Guidolin lit up when he was asked
about his friend, Don Gallinger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was dead,'' said Guidolin.
</P>
<P>
   His greatest regret in life, said Guidolin, was that he had been
traded from the Bruins in 1947 ``because my heart has always been
with the Boston Bruins for the last 50 years. And I know, I just
know if I was with Galley that season, he would never have gotten
involved in this.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallinger said that at times he wishes he had crossed that final
inch between himself and Ross during the first days of the scandal
when he was close to confessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Ross had only said what he would have done for me, I would
have done it,'' said Gallinger. ``But Ross never would say it.''
</P>
<P>
   All these men are in their 70s and 80s now, and their memories
vary. But the sharpest of memories may be that of Ed Sandford, now
a stockbroker in downtown Boston. His memory is one from 35 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Art Ross, in his last years, was living in Kenmore Square, in
the Hotel Kenmore,'' said Sandford. ``By this time in his life, he
was blind. So one day, in the summertime, I say, `Gosh darn, I want
to see if I can say hello to him.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Sandford and Ross swapped memories, and then, according to
Sandford, Ross said, `` `My biggest disappointment in life, Eddie,
was that we weren't able to help Gallinger,' and I said, `Well,
that's too bad.' And he said, `Eddie, do you know the story?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Sandford replied that he still didn't, even after all these
years.
</P>
<P>
   `` `I don't really know much about it,' '' I said, ``and then
Mr. Ross said, `We had all the evidence against him.'
</P>
<P>
   `` `I had talked to (Detroit's) Jack Adams and (Toronto's)
Connie Smythe and the other board of directors and we had it all
set up, that if this kid would say, I did it, I'm sorry, he would
be suspended for a year and he would be reinstated.'
</P>
<P>
   `` `But,' Ross said, `I couldn't tell him that unless he told me
he was sorry, and that son of a gun would never do it. What a sin
it was when all he had to do was say he was sorry.' ''

   TAKE-BOS  
 BOSTON: ... said Gallinger.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``He learned all this betting firstly and initially with the
Toronto Maple Leafs,'' Gallinger went on. ``He owned a pool room in
Oshawa that was run by a friend or two of his, and it would take
bets, and that went on for years while he played with the Toronto
Maple Leafs.''
</P>
<P>
   So Gallinger's ears perked up halfway through the game when,
according to Gallinger, Taylor asked him, `` `Don, how would like
to make some easy money?'
</P>
<P>
   `` `If you want to supplement your salary by another $10,000 to
$12,000, on top of your salary, you're going to have a nice summer,
aren't you?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Easy money, always a lure to Gallinger, was all the more so now,
considering Gallinger's Boston annual salary of $7,500.
</P>
<P>
   The cards were dealt. Taylor talked. More cards were dealt.
Gallinger listened.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very precise but slow, and he weaved himself in and he
did it with words,'' Gallinger recalled. ``But what he didn't know
was that I was already a bettor. I was already a gambler in many
ways _ now, I wasn't fixing hockey games _ and then he said, `What
if I told you how we could make a lot of money over a period of
time like a slow boat to China?' And it would only encompass six or
seven games over the entire schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   But Taylor almost certainly had to know Gallinger liked to
gamble; Gallinger was well known as a gambler in Port Colborne, the
same hometown as Ted Kennedy, a star with the Maple Leafs and
former teammate of Taylor. Also, each and every Bruin knew
Gallinger to be a heavy gambler. And the whispers along the NHL
grapevine more than likely had reached Taylor's ears in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Even more, Taylor and Gallinger had a common friend, Bep
Guidolin. Taylor and Guidolin had been bunkmates at the Canadian
Army base in Newmarket, Ontario, near Toronto, during World War II
in 1944 and '45, and Taylor had often told Guidolin of his gambling
exploits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you, from the stories I got from Billy Taylor,''
recalled Guidolin, ``I heard there was a lot of betting going on in
the NHL.''
</P>
<P>
   Guidolin and Gallinger had joined the Bruins as teen-agers in
1942 _ Guidolin, in fact, was and still is the youngest player (16
years 11 months) ever to make the NHL _ and immediately became
pals. Guidolin was well aware of how much and how often Gallinger
bet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Galley would bet his salary, bet his hockey salary, and go
home broke if he had to,'' recalled Guidolin. ``Just to win some
money . . . on horses . . . ballgames . . . pool games . . .
anything. I used to say to him, `Galley, hang on to your money.
You're blowing it all!' ''
</P>
<P>
   And when Detroit general manager Jack Adams traded Taylor to the
Bruins, the player Ross sent to Detroit in exchange was none other
than Guidolin. No sooner had Guidolin bade farewell to his roommate
and close friend Gallinger in Boston than he was on the phone to
his close friend Taylor in Detroit. ``We said to each other, `I've
been traded for you,' '' recalled Guidolin. And they talked.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gallinger said he made his very first bets on Bruins games that
first year, the 1942-43 season, when he was the 17-year-old rookie.
</P>
<P>
   There was no such thing as security in the NHL in those days,
just as there was next to no security in any sport. Gambling was
blatant in every NHL arena; in Boston Garden, it went on in the
East lobby before games. ``The bookies'd sit in the seats right
above our goal taking bets,'' remembered an old Bruin. Bets on who
would take the next shot, on which goalie would make the next save,
or even whether the next puck deflected into the stands would hit a
man or a woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were six of them above our net,'' recalled Guidolin.
``They were betting on every shot, every shift, on every period.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Gallinger met up with ``Peter,'' a man from the
North End who was ``a guy with a heavy black beard and a cap, a
real fruit-staller,'' said Gallinger. This is the man who would
take the bets, a friend of Guidolin's who ran a fruit stall in
Haymarket Square.
</P>
<P>
   Peter was accommodating. He would take Gallinger's bets at his
fruit stall as Gallinger was making the short walk over to Boston
Garden. Or, if Gallinger missed him there, Peter might be in the
Garden lobby near the Bruins' dressing room as the players walked
in. Finally, there would be a third chance, because Peter
eventually would wander over near the Bruins' bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd warm up and then I'd go over and maybe lean on the bench
area with him for a few seconds and ask him how he's doing,''
Gallinger recalled. ``If you had a last-second urge that you wanted
to bet, you'd say, `Peter, I want to be on; can you take it?' And
he'd say, `Sure, how much?' And I'd just tell him quietly and I'd
skate away. It'd only take a few seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallinger usually bet $50 on a game, sometimes $100 if he had
strong convictions. Always, he emphasized, ``I bet on the Boston
hockey club to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always said to myself, `As long as I was betting on the
Boston hockey club,' I felt morally that I had done nothing
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes he won the bet, said Gallinger. Sometimes he lost.
</P>
<P>
   Guidolin said he never saw Gallinger give Peter any money, nor
did he see Gallinger receive any money. Told that Gallinger had
said he bet frequently his rookie season, Guidolin was adamant in
his reply: ``I don't believe that.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So as the cards were dealt in that upstairs bedroom on Bay State
Road, Gallinger's pose of a naive innocent listening to the ploys
of a crafty veteran might have seemed like an act wasted on Taylor.
So Taylor spun more threads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taylor says to me,'' Gallinger recalled, `` `When we play in
Toronto and when we play in Montreal, who usually wins the games,
Don?' And I said, `If we play in Toronto and we play in Montreal' _
this is me talking now _ `you already know who wins, Billy Taylor.
This is a foolhardy question. But to answer it, Montreal usually
wins in Montreal and, to be more specific, if we were to play seven
games there, if we won one and tied one out of the seven in
Montreal or in Toronto, we would have a good season in that area.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He was hoping to reel me in'' with the thought that if the
Bruins were to lose anyway, even with their best effort, perhaps
money could be made.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he said, `If we were to bet on Montreal against us, and
you already said Montreal logically would win the game, that's
called in gambling circles, Don, that's called giving the
information that you can lose without saying you're fixing,' ''
Gallinger recalled.
</P>
<P>
   More cards were dealt. The gin rummy game went on. Taylor and
Gallinger talked deeper into the plot.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Look, we can have the same situation in Chicago and
we can have the same situation in Detroit,' '' Gallinger recalled.
``And I said, `Well, OK, what do you think when we play in Boston
Garden?' And he said, `Well, I think we'd be absolute fools if we
bet against the Boston hockey club in Boston Garden.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gallinger took all this in. He was not shocked by any of this
talk. In addition to the betting he claimed he did in his rookie
season, he also claimed to have sat in on a meeting with a handful
of Bruins early in the 1943-44 season when there was talk of fixing
a game, though no action was taken. Gallinger instead was thinking
of practical matters.
</P>
<P>
   For a hockey game to be lost intentionally, the goalie must be
involved, Gallinger thought. But the Bruins' goalie was Frankie
Brimsek, Mr. Zero himself, a Hall of Famer-to-be, and it was beyond
even a moment's consideration that the straightforward Brimsek
could be involved in such a plot.
</P>
<P>
   And what of the Bruins' top line, with Schmidt and Dumart?
Absolutely not, even a fool would know; they were absolutely beyond
reproach _ and approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to Taylor, `Tell me what the secret is,' '' Gallinger
recalled. ``He said, `Don't ever lose sight of the fact that I
control one line on this Boston hockey club and you will control
one line on this Boston hockey club.' ''
</P>
<P>
   True enough, Gallinger thought. While Schmidt was the center on
the top line, Taylor would be the center on the second and
Gallinger the center on the third. More and more, Gallinger was
taken by what this crafty veteran, this gambler, this Billy Taylor
was saying to him.

SILENCE BROKEN 51 YEARS LATER 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- That scrap of paper had been in Don Gallinger's wallet
for a week now. Undisturbed. On the paper was written a telephone
number in Detroit, but Gallinger had not looked at it since the
Detroit gangster had slipped it into his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Nor had Gallinger thrown it away.
</P>
<P>
   Gallinger, the 22-year-old center of the Boston Bruins, at the
time the only player ever to make the jump directly from Junior B
to the National Hockey League, was torn. He knew exactly what the
number meant.
</P>
<P>
   If he took that piece of paper from his wallet, if he asked the
telephone operator to make the connection to that phone in Detroit,
it could mean money. Easy money. And Gallinger, a gambler since he
was a teenage pool-room sharpie in his hometown of Port Colborne,
Ontario, on the shores of Lake Erie, often found the lure of easy
money irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Gallinger also was fully aware that no gamble was without
risk. The downside, if he pulled that piece of paper from his
wallet, could be immense. It could be the end of everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally looked at that piece of paper,'' said Gallinger, who
now lives like a recluse in a one-room apartment in Burlington,
Ontario, a city on the shores of Lake Ontario, about an hour
southwest of Toronto. ``No name on it, just a telephone number.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins had just boarded their train at South Station on Feb.
16, 1948, for the road trip everyone despised, a daylong journey to
the farthest destination in the cozy six-team NHL: Chicago. As
usual, Gallinger quickly hooked up with Hammie Moore, the Bruins
trainer, for their game of high-stakes gin rummy, almost before the
train had left South Station.
</P>
<P>
   Gallinger's mind, for once, was not on the cards. It was on that
phone number.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to myself, `We're going to have a hell of a time trying
to beat Chicago in Chicago,' '' Gallinger recalled. `` `And we're
going to be favored by a goal spread.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins team on that train to Chicago was in shambles. Milt
Schmidt, the captain and a future Hall of Famer, had blown out his
knee two weeks earlier and would be out five weeks. Clare Martin, a
defenseman, had banged his shoulder into a goalpost three days
earlier when the Bruins and New York Rangers tied, 4-4, at Boston
Garden. And John Crawford, another defenseman, was distraught that
his daughter Mary, born only three days earlier, was fighting for
her life in a Boston hospital. Few of the Bruins thought Crawford
would even make the trip to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Boston was in even more dismal shape on the ice. The Bruins had
played six of their last seven games at the Garden and had
squandered the opportunity, going a mere 1-5-1 even with Schmidt
playing in three of those games and Martin and Crawford in all of
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never so cocksure in my life that Chicago would win that
game with Schmidt out and Crawford out,'' said Gallinger, whose
memory of Crawford missing that game is incorrect. ``I was cocksure
that it couldn't be any way else no matter how hard a game I
played.''
</P>
<P>
   Easy money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the only one now looking to make $3,000 on an outcome that
I felt had no variance to it,'' remembered Gallinger. ``We are
going to be beaten by that Chicago hockey club. It was always a
ringed circus to win against that club, no matter what strength you
had.''
</P>
<P>
   The risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I said to myself, `Gallinger, you've been up and down like
a toilet seat. It's a nightmare psychologically and you're a fool
and it might cost you a career.' So I talked to myself that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Hour after hour, the train wheels of the Lake Shore Limited
clicked west through Albany and Buffalo and onward toward Chicago
and destiny. Hour after hour, Gallinger's mind weighed risk and
reward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going out to Chicago and I'm saying to myself, `Maybe,
just maybe, I should make the killing,' '' Gallinger would think
one moment. `` `(I'm) going to go for the bundle.' '' Only to be
followed by the heart-quickening risk of it all, that he had been
gambling all his life but never for stakes this high.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' train pulled into Chicago. By the time the team
reached the LaSalle Hotel, Don Gallinger had made up his mind. He
had weighed Easy Money vs. Extreme Risk and finally decided what to
do with that piece of paper that had been undisturbed in his wallet
for a week, burning a hole, as it were, into his psyche and soul.
And, ultimately, his life.

   The first web of Hockey's Greatest Scandal was spun on an
October afternoon in 1947 at Ruthie Hatch's boarding house at 165
Bay State Road in Boston's Back Bay, just steps from Kenmore Square
and Fenway Park. The first strand of that web was spun innocently
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you going to be around?'' Billy Taylor, the newest Bruin,
had said to Gallinger as the two passed each other on the stairs
that led to the bedrooms of the 14-room house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I don't think I'm going anywhere,'' Gallinger told Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   As usual in hockey, there was time to kill, even more so if you
were a Bruin playing for Art Ross, who had helped found the team 23
years earlier and never believed in practicing much. Two years
earlier, Ross had turned over full-time coaching duties to Aubrey
``Dit'' Clapper, who had been weaned on Ross's style in his two
decades with the Bruins _ Clapper was the NHL's first 20-year
player _ and also believed that fewer practices saved the legs for
the games.
</P>
<P>
   Gallinger recalled, ``Taylor said to me, `Why don't you come up
to the third floor and play some gin rummy with me?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor had just arrived from Detroit in an unexpected trade that
had shocked players on both the Bruins and Red Wings. After all,
Taylor had been the No. 3 scorer in the NHL the previous season,
finishing behind Chicago's Max Bentley and the Canadiens' Rocket
Richard and a point ahead of Schmidt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought Taylor would be the stud,'' said Fernie Flaman, a
defenseman on the team. And Schmidt remembered thinking when the
trade was made, `` `We're really in clover.' Due to the fact that
Billy Taylor was a great hockey player. What a good stickhandler
and what a good playmaker. Billy was small but pretty quick.''
Billy Taylor, said Bruins defenseman Pat Egan, ``had to be one of
the 10 best who ever played.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, a team in transition, needed Taylor. Bobby Bauer had
just retired, persuaded by his wife's family that his future would
be more lucrative in the family business, fashioning and marketing
the famed Bauer skates. (He had married a hometown woman from
Kitchener, Ontario, whose maiden name also was Bauer.) ``It was a
mistake that Bobby let himself be talked into that,'' Schmidt rued.
``Bobby could have played another three or four years.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only was the famed Kraut Line of Schmidt, Bauer, and Woody
Dumart broken up after a decade of glory, but center Bill Cowley,
another Hall of Famer, also had just retired unhappily.
</P>
<P>
   So Taylor was needed by the Bruins. Yet there was some unease
deep in the minds of some Bruins veterans about Taylor because,
recalled defenseman Murray Henderson, ``Billy had a reputation (for
gambling) when he was playing junior in Oshawa (Ontario)'' eight
years earlier, when he led the Oshawa Generals to Canada's junior
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Egan, another defenseman, personally knew of Taylor's gambling.
And more than a few Bruins had heard rumors that Taylor, when he
played for Toronto, had bet on Maple Leafs games along with Toronto
defenseman Babe Pratt and possibly other Leafs.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt had been suspended 16 days by the league in 1946 for his
gambling during the 1945-46 season, a burgeoning scandal nipped in
the bud, then buried by the intercession of Toronto general manager
Conn Smythe. Smythe, in many eyes, was so powerful that he was the
de facto head of the league even though Red Dutton carried the
title of NHL president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy Taylor and Don Gallinger were one and the same,'' said
Kenny Smith, a forward on that Bruins team. ``They were gamblers.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallinger knew of Taylor's reputation when Taylor invited him
upstairs that October afternoon for that game of gin rummy. Taylor
had begun his career with the Maple Leafs, ``and everybody in the
NHL, including myself, knew that if you mentioned Billy Taylor's
name, in their eyes he was a bookmaker,'' said Gallinger.

   ``I said, `Look, Billy, I know you control one-third of the
lines and I know I control one-third of the lines and the two of
them should be able to control the game. And I know you haven't
talked to me about goaltending and all that and I still know that's
the greatest part of this game, but that's neither here nor there,'
'' Gallinger remembered. `` `But I'll tell you right now, I'm in.'
''
</P>
<P>
   And the easy money? How much would Gallinger and Taylor make for
betting on games in which they played. The 1919 Chicago White Sox _
the infamous Black Sox _ never had to put up money of their own to
fix the World Series with Cincinnati; instead, they were promised
$80,000 by notorious New York gambler Arnold Rothstein and others
in on the fix. The same was true for the college basketball players
who fixed games in the New York City area and other parts of the
country a few years after Taylor and Gallinger had their chat in
Boston. They never had to put up their own money.
</P>
<P>
   But for Taylor and Gallinger, there'd be no freebies. If they
wanted to bet on Bruins games, Taylor explained, they would have to
use their own money. ``So what would be the edge?'' Gallinger
thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Taylor) said, `The key to us replenishing our salaries was to
give the right information on the right game at the right time,' ''
is Gallinger's recollection. ``We'd get odds at 2-1.''
</P>
<P>
   More cards were dealt. The gin rummy game went on. More details
were worked out.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor told Gallinger that he would handle the betting himself.
Taylor said he had a friend in Detroit who would take the bets. But
he cautioned Gallinger that nothing must be said about the plot,
that they would talk about it only the day before, or the morning
of, a particular game on which they wished to bet.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I say, `So you've got all the ducks on the pond and you've
got it all figured out,' '' recalled Gallinger. ``And he said,
`That's right.' And he said, `Now I have to say this to you. Don't
you ever say yes, you're in, even though I'm doing all the
telephoning, all the legwork, and still consulting with you at
least the morning of the game, and hopefully in most cases, on the
day before the game . . .' ''
</P>
<P>
   In Gallinger's mind _ and the former Bruin said it was the same
in Taylor's _ the two were not fixing hockey games. They were
merely taking advantage of information they had, information about
injuries, on whether the Bruins might be playing poorly and their
upcoming opponent might be playing well _ ``judging all the
elements.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And now he slips in this final nugget,'' said Gallinger, ``and
I just looked at him.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said, according to Gallinger, `` `There're some things,
if we go ahead, you just better not forget. You better keep your
eye on the goddamned clock if this thing is ever getting out of
hand, because we just don't want to give our goddamned money away.
We want it to happen. So you've always got to be conscious to make
this happen if it's not happening.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And Gallinger recalled replying, `` `You don't have to be
emphatic with me, Billy Taylor.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the card game ended. The two Bruins went downstairs
in Ruthie Hatch's boarding house.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins opened the 1947-48 season with a bang. They dominated
the Rangers, 3-1, in their first game and then beat the Canadiens
by the identical score, both times at Boston Garden. Three days
later, though, the Bruins traveled to Montreal, where the Canadiens
trounced them, 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins won four of their five games in October but slipped
in November, particularly late in the month when they went 0-3-2.
Included in that dry spell was a 4-3 loss to Toronto in Maple Leaf
Gardens, a 5-3 loss to the Blackhawks in Chicago, and a 4-1 loss in
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Even more alarming was that Taylor was not playing well. The new
publication, The Hockey News, had a banner headline proclaiming
Taylor as the ``next Bill Cowley'' _ a perennial top scorer for the
Bruins in the early '40s and a Hall of Famer _ but Taylor was
playing like nothing of the sort. Taylor was dismal, far from the
player who had been third in NHL scoring the previous season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had accepted him,'' recalled Egan, the Bruins' brawling
defenseman. ``We thought that was a shot in the arm for us, to get
a centerman like that. Cripes, we were sitting on top of the world.
But he just didn't seem to play (well) here.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, the defenseman, also was mystified.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what happened with Taylor,'' said Henderson. ``He
might have been disappointed because the Bruins then were not in
the upper echelon, figuring that he had been downgraded. And
perhaps he needed somebody on the wings; he could produce, but not
all by himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was with the Bruins for 3 1/2 months. In that span, said
Gallinger, he and Taylor bet roughly a half-dozen times against the
Bruins. Most intriguing is that Gallinger cannot remember the exact
number of bets, the specific games, or how much was won or lost,
except that ``we won some and we lost some.''
</P>
<P>
   By late January, Bruins owner Weston Adams announced to the
media, ``Billy Taylor never would play again for the Boston
Bruins.'' Adams and Ross were attempting to trade Taylor but could
not immediately find any takers.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was sent home to Oshawa until Ross's close friend, the
Rangers' Lester Patrick, relieved him of the burdensome Taylor for
journeyman forward Grant ``Knobby'' Warwick. After a mysterious
interlude, when Taylor claimed the Bruins had lost his skates, the
veteran finally left Oshawa and reported to New York in early
February. In his tenure with the Bruins, Taylor had four goals and
16 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Gallinger, meanwhile, claimed to be relieved that Taylor was
gone. He said he had been emotionally wrought over the betting and,
when Ross finally traded Taylor, he thought, `` `Thank God, thank
the Lord, that bastard is gone. He could never benefit me. All this
has been a dirty mess and there's never been a lot of money made.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Gallinger's actions, though, belied his words.
</P>
<P>
   On a trip that season to Detroit, Taylor invited Gallinger to go
out after the game to a ``smoky dance hall some 20 or 30 miles
outside Detroit,'' according to Gallinger. There Taylor introduced
Gallinger to the man who was taking their bets. That man's name was
James Tamer.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 8, 1948, after another Bruins-Red Wings game at the
Olympia, one of the first games the Bruins had played without
Taylor _ a game Boston won, 3-1 _ Gallinger recalled going to a bar
near the Leland Hotel, where the Bruins stayed in Detroit. Teammate
Wally Wilson, just called up from the Bruins' American Hockey
League farm team in Hershey to replace Taylor, was with him.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson had played with Taylor for the Oshawa Generals and,
according to Gallinger, ``knew everything about Taylor's
background.''
</P>
<P>
   So Wilson and Gallinger were in the bar talking, recalled
Gallinger, ``and I see something out of the corner of my eye and I
turn and I look _ you could cut the smoke _ and I said, `Jesus
Christ, that man walking toward us,' I said to myself, ``that man
looks like James Tamer.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Tamer, ``a small, slick'' man, walked over to Gallinger, sat
next to him, and, according to Gallinger, said, `` `Don, nice to
see you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The two shook hands, and Tamer said, `` `Billy Taylor really
likes you,' '' Gallinger remembered, ``and I said, `I think he's a
hell of a fine guy, too, but right now he's the goddamned enemy and
I don't care if I ever see him again.' ''
</P>
<P>
   There was silence for a moment. Tamer then told Gallinger, ``
`Any friend of Billy Taylor's is a friend of mine,' '' and, `` `If
you ever want to do business with me someday in the same private
angle that Taylor made business, then you're welcome.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gallinger recalled Tamer giving him his phone number on a piece
of paper, saying, `` `I'm the only one who ever answers that
number,' '' and slipping the paper into Gallinger's pocket. ``
`Just look at that someday. That's all I want to say to you. It
might never happen or you might use it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   James Tamer, a bank robber, an ex-con, and one of Detroit's most
notorious gangsters, then left.
</P>
<P>
   Don Gallinger did not throw away the piece of paper.

DON GALLINGER MAKES THE GAMBLE OF A LIFETIME 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT COLBORNE, Ontario _ The Lake Shore Limited was pulling
west, just out of Buffalo and onward toward Cleveland and Chicago.
It was Monday, Feb. 16, 1948, and the train was full of travelers,
including 14 players, the coach, general manager, and trainer of
the Boston Bruins, who had stepped aboard at South Station in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Even 24 hours after the first rush, adrenaline was flowing
through the Bruins. They were still excited, still flush with a
pulsating 3-1 victory over the Detroit Red Wings at Boston Garden
the previous night, maybe their best game of a thus-far lackluster
season.
</P>
<P>
   Player after player talked of goaltender Frankie Brimsek and his
41 brilliant saves. The Brimsek of old. And Woody Dumart was asked
to repeat, blow for blow, how he had taught that cocky youngster of
the Wings, Gordie Howe, a lesson or two after Howe had gone in
alone on Brimsek in the first period, only to have the goalie rob
him. A frustrated Howe then crashed into the Boston goalie, sending
Brimsek flying from the crease. A furious Dumart, looking for Howe,
first leveled Detroit's tough defenseman, ``Black Jack'' Stewart,
then Sid Abel. All within 10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Boston's bright young star, Don Gallinger, who had
thrown the Gallery Gods into delirium, up in the second balcony of
the Garden with their cowbells and whistles. On Howe's next visit
to the ice, Gallinger caught the youngster in the corner and
delivered a vicious and cheap _ but justified _ elbow to the face,
dropping Howe into a heap. The 20-year-old Howe had promise for
Detroit, but the 23-year-old Gallinger had been delivering for
Boston since his rookie season in 1942-43.
</P>
<P>
   But once Gallinger boarded the train to Chicago with his
teammates, the cheers and praise and adulation from the night
before were a distant memory. Gallinger's mind was racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was saying to myself, `Gallinger, you've been up and down
like a toilet seat with this,' '' recalled Gallinger.
</P>
<P>
   Gallinger's mind raced, the blond center trying to decide the
ultimate question of his life: Was he going to go for the easy
money and, in the process, commit the most despicable act any
professional athlete could commit?
</P>
<P>
   As always, after reading all seven of Boston's newspapers,
Gallinger had hooked up on the long train ride with the one card
player all the Bruins had learned to avoid _ assistant trainer
Hammie Moore _ for their usual high-stakes game of gin rummy.
</P>
<P>
   On many road trips, a player might lose several hundred dollars
to Moore, a huge sum for guys making about $7,500 a season.
</P>
<P>
   Gallinger played for large stakes, ``and I'd watch those games
with Hammie,'' said Bep Guidolin, a former teammate of Gallinger's,
``and I'd say to Galley, `What are you doing? You're getting in too
deep.' And he'd say, `I can beat Hammie,' and Hammie would tell me
to butt out. Hammie was sharp with the cards. He'd say, `Bep, I've
got my living here; leave me alone. I've got a live one here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   For once, though, Gallinger was not obsessed with the cards. On
other train rides, then-Bruins captain Milt Schmidt recalled,
Gallinger would kill the boredom by attempting to entice his
teammates to bet on happenstance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Galley would bet on anything,'' said Schmidt, repeating the
words of many former Bruins. He would even going so far as to bet
on whether the license plate on the next car we saw out of the
train window had a 5 in it.
</P>
<P>
   Gallinger thought and thought. Billy Taylor had been traded away
by the Bruins two weeks earlier, and Taylor had been the one
calling that phone number that was now on a piece of paper in
Gallinger's pocket _ the number of gangster James Tamer in Detroit
_ to place bets on Bruins games for himself and Galinger. Taylor
had said it was easy. Maybe it was.
</P>
<P>
   When the Lake Shore Limited pulled out of Buffalo, Gallinger
thought back to his youth and his gambling in Port Colborne,
Ontario, just 60 or 70 miles from Niagara Falls. As teen-agers, he
and Ted Kennedy, the icon of the Toronto Maple Leafs, had hustled
the local Port Colborne pool room sharpies for 10s, 20s, even
hundreds of dollars. And when Gallinger wanted bigger action, he
would drive to Welland, the next town over between Port Colborne
and St. Catharines, and jump into high-stakes craps games.
</P>
<P>
   But this? This was different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew my career could be ended,'' said Gallinger.
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit gangster had given Gallinger his phone number during
the Bruins' last visit to Detroit, two weeks earlier. Now that
Taylor was gone from the Bruins, the gangster wanted to keep the
pipeline of information open. Gallinger couldn't decide what to do.
</P>
<P>
   Gallinger insisted that no other Bruins knew of his mental
torment. ``One thing Billy Taylor had driven home to me,'' said
Gallinger, ``was there was to be no talk of this. There wasn't even
going to be a whisper.''
</P>
<P>
   But two other Bruins on that train, forward Jimmy Peters and
defenseman Pat Egan, had inklings that something was amiss.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bruins general manager Art Ross had acquired Peters from
Montreal two months earlier in an attempt to fill the gaping hole
caused by the retirement of Bobby Bauer, a mainstay on the feared
Kraut Line with Schmidt and Woody Dumart. Egan, a brawling and
burly defenseman, had been acquired in 1944 by Ross in another
futile attempt by the Boston general manager ``to find the next
Eddie Shore.'' Egan was good but he was no Shore, the Bruins'
legendary, terrifying defenseman who had finished his career eight
years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Peters has two distinct memories of what happened around the
time of that game in Chicago, and each memory contradicts
Gallinger's version. Gallinger has insisted that he met Tamer only
twice. The first time was in the presence of Taylor early in the
1947-48 season, ``at a nightclub out in the country, some 20 or 35
miles out from Detroit.''
</P>
<P>
   The second time was in early February 1948, at a downtown bar
near the Detroit Leland Hotel, where the Bruins stayed.At the
second meeting, said Gallinger, he was seated with teammate Wally
Wilson, newly called up to Boston from Hershey of the American
Hockey League, when Tamer approached and gave Gallinger his phone
number.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met James Tamer once,'' said Peters, whose memory suggests a
possible third meeting between the gangster and Gallinger. ``It was
in a bar in Detroit near (the Leland Hotel); I think it was called
the Famous Door. I was new to the team then and hadn't made many
friends yet and I was in that bar alone. I can remember it like it
was yesterday. It was a long bar and Galley came over and said he
wanted me to meet somebody. Gallinger said, `Jimmy, I'd like to
introduce you to this guy.' It was Jimmy Tamer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget that name, especially in light of what
happened,'' said Peters. ``I just walked away. I guess that was the
smartest thing I ever did in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Peters recalled that Gallinger and the gangster were with a
group of people, none of whom were Bruins, and Wilson was nowhere
in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he was new to the Bruins, Peters had quickly learned
that Gallinger was a bettor, a heavy bettor. Peters also lived in
Ruthie Hatch's boarding house at 165 Bay State Road in Boston with
Gallinger, Taylor, and other Bruins, ``and I've seen Galley and
Taylor cut a deck of cards for $500 just before a game _ high card
for $500 _ it'd be at the boarding house,'' said Peters.
</P>
<P>
   Peters's memory was in conflict with Gallinger's on another
matter, too. Gallinger said he was not betting on hockey games
because he needed to cover gambling debts. Although Peters cannot
remember the exact date _ he thought it was around the time of this
trip to Chicago _ ``this happened in Boston,'' recalled Peters.
``Wally Wilson came back to the boarding house and I called to him
when he came back, `Wally, where've you been?' He said he had just
been to a bank to borrow $500 for Don Gallinger.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson was friendly with Gallinger and also Taylor, the other
Bruin who gambled on games; Wilson and Taylor had played together
with the Oshawa Generals before coming to the NHL. Gallinger, for
his part, denied that he asked Wilson to borrow money for him.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Egan's memory jibed with Peters's recollection of Wilson going
to a bank to borrow $500 for Gallinger. Egan distinctly remembered
this incident happening in Boston a few days before the Bruins
boarded the train for that fateful trip to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wally Wilson was in this deeper than anybody realized,'' said
Egan, ``but he's the guy who got away with the most.''
Specifically, the former defenseman went on, the Bruins had just
finished practice at Boston Arena when several players told Egan
they would be meeting around the corner at their usual
post-practice hangout, the Blue Moon, a bar on Massachusetts
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was right before that Chicago game, maybe three or four
days before that game,'' recalled Egan. ``The players said the
meeting was just to get together and talk about our hockey team.
Anyway, I'm there before the other players and I'm having my beer
when that (expletive) Wilson comes in and sits opposite me. He
says, `Pat, I want to borrow $500.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the passage of a half-century, Egan grew livid at the
memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyway, I say, `Wilson, I don't even know you, for Chrissakes'
_ he's dodged a lot of bullets, Wilson has; I think he was involved
in this a lot deeper than he ever made out to be _ and I said,
`Christ, I don't even know you; why would I lend you $500?' He
never said why he wanted the money and I should have had enough
brains to ask him, but I didn't at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Egan said he was so angry that he left the Blue Moon before
other players arrived. The next day, Egan went on, he learned there
had been a fistfight among several players at the bar. ``Well, it
had to be Gallinger,'' said Egan, ``and it had to be Wilson.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallinger denied any of this happened; Wilson is dead.
</P>
<P>
   Said Egan, ``Then we get on that train a few days later for
Chicago and look what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the train pulled into Chicago on Tuesday afternoon, Feb.
17, 1948, Gallinger had made up his mind. No sooner had the team
arrived at the LaSalle Hotel in The Loop than Gallinger removed
from his wallet the piece of paper that James Tamer, the Detroit
gangster, had given him.
</P>
<P>
   Gallinger had decided to make the call. He would bet on the
Bruins-Black Hawks game the next night. He would bet on Chicago to
win.He had decided to betray his teammates and friends on the
Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout that train ride from Boston, Gallinger had rehearsed
what he might say to Tamer in the phone conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never give my name because Taylor had told me not
to,'' Gallinger recalled. ``I was thinking of saying, `I like
Chicago because the Hawks might play (hard) and win tomorrow
night,' and he might get the hang of it that he was talking to a
hockey player.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, long-distance phone calls could not be made from hotel
rooms. There were banks of operators in the lobbies of the finer
hotels, and to make a long-distance call, a person would have to
give an operator the number and the operator would make the
connection. When the connection was made, the operator would direct
the caller to a row of booths in the lobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had given the operator the number in Detroit to call and I
remember all the booths were along the wall and the operator had
told me to go to Booth 8 or something,'' recalled Gallinger. ``And
now the voice comes on the other end and I say, `I happen to be in
Chicago.' I said, `Can you give me the goal spread on the hockey
game tomorrow night in Chicago? Between the Black Hawks and
Boston?'
</P>
<P>
   ``(I was speaking) just as if (I) were a regular gambler. And
the voice? I knew it was Tamer's I just knew it. And he said, `I'm
sorry to say we give no goal spreads on the days before the game;
you can only get a goal spread on the day of the game, after the
noon hour.' And he said, `If you want to speak again, you call
tomorrow at the same time.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gallinger left the booth. He was confused. The Bruin wanted the
easy money, but an inner voice was screaming at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, this was the first bottleneck into what happened,''
Gallinger recalled thinking. ``It should have been a tipoff to me,
psychologically and morally. I said, `Damn it, I didn't like the
fact I had to make the call (again).' ''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Gallinger fought with himself, alternately thinking,
``Something like this is a criminal act,'' and, ``Nobody's being
murdered. We're not concocting a murder here.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gallinger recalled many vivid details of this visit to Chicago,
but some of his recollections are incorrect. For one thing, he said
time and again that the team stayed in the Madison Hotel and he
made the phone call to Tamer from its lobby. But the Bruins stayed
at the LaSalle Hotel in Chicago in the '40s.
</P>
<P>
   For another, Gallinger recalled that this Bruins-Black Hawks
game was scheduled for a Sunday night and he had made his first
phone call to Tamer on a Saturday afternoon. But the game actually
was on a Wednesday night and the phone call was made Tuesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Gallinger said one reason he had decided to make the bet
was that Boston would be shorthanded for the game. Gallinger
recalled correctly that Schmidt, the Bruins captain, was back in
Boston with a knee injury suffered two weeks earlier. But Gallinger
insisted that John Crawford, one of the Bruins' top defensemen,
also missed the game because his infant daughter was gravely ill in
a Boston hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford's daughter, Mary, born three days earlier, was in fact
in a life-or-death situation back in Boston. But Ross, the team's
general manager, apparently prevailed on Crawford to make the trip
because the Bruins' defense was in desperate straits. Clare Martin
had injured his shoulder in the Detroit game three days earlier and
could not play in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we'd be down to three defensemen,'' recalled Fern
Flaman. ``Me, Pat Egan, and Murray Henderson.''
</P>
<P>
   When the puck was dropped in Chicago, Martin did not play but
Crawford did, even though his daughter had died earlier that day in
Boston. Ross kept this news from Crawford until after the game,
later explaining that there was no way for Crawford to get back to
Boston anyway, since the next flight would not be until the
morning. Crawford returned to Boston on that plane Thursday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Gallinger has no recollection of Martin missing the game, but he
has a clear memory that Crawford was absent.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, ``the next afternoon I'm back in the lobby and I
went right back to the (telephone) girl and I say to her, `I'd like
to place a straight call, straight through, no person-to-person,'
and she said, `What's the number?' She plugs it in and tells me to
go to a certain booth.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallinger's life would be forever changed by what he said when
he went to that booth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voice comes on again and I know it's Tamer,'' Gallinger
said. `` `I think I spoke to you yesterday on the spread on the
game between Boston and Chicago.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gallinger recalled Tamer saying, `` `There's been a lot of
action on that game. But what can I do for you?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gallinger answered, `` `I really think I would like Chicago in
this game. I want Chicago to win for $1,500.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And Tamer replied, according to Gallinger, `` `Chicago. You've
got it. $1,500.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I just said, `Thank you very much. We'll speak again.' And
he hung up.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unknown to Gallinger, unknown to Taylor, and unknown to Tamer,
Detective Lt. William J. Bourke of the Detroit Police Department's
vice squad and the Michigan State Parole Board were determined to
get James Tamer off the streets of Detroit. Tamer and accomplices
had held up the Citizens Commercial and Savings Bank in Flint,
Mich., in 1934 and gotten away with $53,000.
</P>
<P>
   Tamer was fingered but not captured until four years later, when
he was involved in an auto accident in Florida in which a person
was killed. Tamer was arrested in Florida, confessed in 1939 to the
holdup, and was sentenced to 15-25 years in Michigan State Prison
in Jackson. Six years later, though, after a surprisingly quick
parole, Tamer was a free man.

 &HT;    Late primary has state seeking campaign clout
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Flying in a private jet across Florida
next month, big Bush might look at little Bush and ask in his Texas
twang, ``What happened, little brother?''
</P>
<P>
   Florida was supposed to become part of mega-state primary next
year that would force candidates to raise millions of dollars in
order to win the GOP nomination for president. Instead, Florida is
likely to have the ``who cares'' primary, with the nominee chosen
days earlier by states with far fewer voters.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush had hoped that Florida would join
California, New York, Massachusetts and a handful of other states
in having its presidential primary on March 7. The huge primary
event is likely to starve cash-poor candidates and help the
campaign-rich, such as Bush, who is expected to report at the end
of June that he has raised more than $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   Changing the primary from March 14 to March 7 was supposed to be
easy. No one expected the legislature to balk. Gov. Jeb Bush said
it was important to him. State GOP Chairman Al Cardenas said
failure to pass the bill would mean that ``a state that now has
over 15 million residents would in effect become disenfranchised.''
</P>
<P>
   It all looked like it was going to happen until the final days
of the session, when Senate President Toni Jennings attached
campaign finance reform to the date-change bill. House Speaker John
Thrasher wanted no part of campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side would budge and the bill died on the last day of
the session.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at least 20 states are planning to have primaries or
caucuses before Florida and the number is growing.
</P>
<P>
   The shift is taking place because many states resent the
influence of Iowa and New Hampshire on the selection of
presidential nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa and New Hampshire fight ferociously to protect their
interests. New Hampshire state law requires the state to have its
primary seven days before any other state that picks delegates to
the national conventions. Iowa, with its caucuses eight days before
the New Hampshire primary, is the only state that acts with New
Hampshire's blessing.
</P>
<P>
   Delaware has infuriated New Hampshire by insisting on having its
primary just four days after the Granite State's. South Carolina is
threatening to do the same thing. And this week, the Michigan
Democratic executive committee voted to move its caucus to the
Saturday before the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   N.H. seeks candidate pledges
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire has asked all the candidates to sign pledges not
to campaign in states that have primaries or caucuses within seven
days of its primary.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic candidates Vice President Al Gore and former U.S.
Sen. Bill Bradley have signed. Some Republicans have signed, but
George W. Bush has not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not right that two states have such a huge impact on the
way we pick a president. It's not right that the candidates visit
those states a huge number of times while other states get few
visits,'' said U.S. Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., who engineered his
state's move.
</P>
<P>
   While the Republican Party does not have any rules protecting
New Hampshire and Iowa, the Democratic Party does and could refuse
to seat delegates from a state that violates the rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll take our case to the convention, where I predict all the
other states, except New Hampshire and Iowa, will give us a
standing ovation for having the guts to do what's right,'' Levin
told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Florida may join in the ovation, but it's too late to change the
primary here.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Republicans are hoping that their two-day state convention
in October will convince the candidates to spend more time in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The party is still trying to figure out a precise format for the
convention. Some candidates might balk at participating in the
event if it appears that Jeb Bush is trying to be too helpful to
his big brother.
</P>
<P>
   Will candidates debate?
</P>
<P>
   The party wants to have some kind of forum featuring all of the
candidates on the second day of the convention.
</P>
<P>
   So far there is no talk about a formal debate but the candidates
could be asked prepared questions.
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be little likelihood that there will be any kind
of straw ballot, as there was in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have preferred to have had an earlier primary but I
think, because we are the fourth-largest state, we're still going
to get a lot of attention from these candidates,'' Jeb Bush said
Thursday during a visit to West Palm Beach. ``Since I have a dog in
the fight, I think it's safe to say I'll do whatever I can to help
him win.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats may have less of a problem. With only two candidates,
some believe that Bradley will be able to stay in the primaries
much longer than he could if there were other contenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bradley and Gore are going to spend an awful lot of
time here,'' said state Democratic Party Chairman Charles
Whitehead. ``I think there is a good chance a nominee won't be
picked until the very end of the primary season.''
</P>
<P>
   In December, Florida Democrats will hold a straw ballot at their
convention. President Clinton has often said that his first
campaign for president wasn't taken seriously until he won the 1992
straw ballot at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida will always be important in the election because it is
the fourth-largest state and it's a place where a lot of money is
raised,'' said Republican political strategist Mike Murphy, whose
Virginia-based firm, MPGH, has worked on scores of state and
national campaigns, most recently the presidential campaign of Bob
Dole and Jeb Bush's successful campaign for governor last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think history is going to repeat itself and the nominee will
be decided after Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina,'' Murphy
said. ``March 7 will just be the cleanup for whoever is ahead'' for
the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the candidates are not ignoring Florida. Bradley will
attend a private event in West Palm Beach on Monday. Gore will be
in Orlando on May 24 and in Tampa and Miami on June 29. Bush, who
has not officially announced yet, will campaign and raise money on
June 25 in Naples, Tampa, Fort Lauderdale and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in the general election, Florida is going to be a
major player,'' Murphy said. ``If George W. is the nominee, that
takes out Texas and that leaves Florida as the only other large
southern state. Whoever wins Florida is going to win the
election.''

 &HT;    Recently elected Mexican leaders are shaking up old, corrupt
order
 &HT;    By Dave Harmon
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NUEVO LAREDO, Tamaulipas, Mexico _ The new mayor opened a door
in the corner of his office and climbed down the secret spiral
staircase that let him avoid the throng of people constantly
jockeying for a moment of his time.
</P>
<P>
   ``My escape route,'' Mayor Horacio Garza Garza explained as he
edged down the steep stairs to the street.
</P>
<P>
   He may need it.
</P>
<P>
   With his new get-tough campaign against public corruption and
drug trafficking in this rapidly growing border city, Garza is
quickly making enemies among a police force that has become
notorious for harboring officers who participated in more crimes
than they stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Since he took office in January, Garza, an accountant and
auditor by trade, has teamed up with his new police chief,
Moctezuma Rodriguez Meza, to fire 200 police officers, a quarter of
the city force. The officers doing business with drug gangs were
easy to spot and fire because of their big houses and flashy cars,
Garza said, and the rest were shown the door after failing surprise
drug tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police were contaminated,'' said Garza, who also took a
drug test along with his top department heads. ``They were paid,
and they protected the interests of the gangs. It was very
evident.''
</P>
<P>
   Garza isn't the only elected official shaking things up across
the Rio Grande. From Chihuahua to Matamoros, several new border
mayors and governors are trying to make their mark with sweeping
campaigns against public corruption, alcohol-fueled disorder and
government inefficiency.
</P>
<P>
   This surge of reform comes from an unlikely source. The new
officeholders are members of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary
Party, or PRI, which has earned more headlines for fostering
corruption than for fighting it.
</P>
<P>
   The new leaders include:
</P>
<P>
   _Chihuahua Gov. Patricio Martinez, who took office last October
and quickly launched a zero-tolerance policy that took aim at 26
different social ills, including bars that sell alcohol after
hours, public servants who accept improper gifts or abuse their
authority, state workers who slack off on the job and bus drivers
who show up drunk or run red lights.
</P>
<P>
   _Tamaulipas Gov. Toma(accent)s Yarrington Ruvalcaba, who was
sworn in Feb. 4 and has tried to streamline the state government,
cutting the number of state agencies from 12 to five. He has also
introduced exams and background tests for state employees and law
enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   _Reynosa Mayor Luis Gerardo Higareda, who was in office just
three months before he announced a surprise drug test April 5 for
all city police officers. More than 80 officers quit on the spot,
and 57 others tested positive and were fired; in all, the city
across the river from McAllen purged more than a third of its
officers. Less than a week later, Reynosa police set up a sobriety
checkpoint between the bar district and the international bridge
and charged 49 people _ including 37 Texans _ with drunken driving.
</P>
<P>
   Observers such as Rodolfo de la Garza, a University of Texas
government professor, say a string of corruption scandals _ a
former president's brother, the nation's top drug official and
numerous elected officials have been accused of working with drug
lords _ has weakened the old guard's grip on the party and cleared
the way for a new generation of PRI reformers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because they are genuinely threatened by (drug corruption),
there is a large number of the PRI that have dedicated themselves
to an anti-corruption platform,'' de la Garza said. ``The problem
is whether or not it can be done. . . . Nobody knows who the bad
guys are anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's political landscape also is changing. Party primaries
have replaced the old system of party leaders hand-picking new
mayors and governors, and in the past few years, the two main
opposition parties have won numerous governorships and now have a
significant presence in the congress.
</P>
<P>
   That means the new crop of PRI candidates is having to fight in
the electoral trenches for the first time. For example, Yarrington,
an economist who has served as a congressman and mayor of
Matamoros, defeated three other PRI candidates in the first primary
in Tamaulipas history. Martinez became the first PRI governor to
reclaim a state from an opposition party.
</P>
<P>
   The result, de la Garza said, is that this new generation of
governors and mayors has ``a genuine constituency in ways that
their predecessors did not, and they're responding to those
constituencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Yarrington, who said he has chopped 600 jobs from the state
payroll during his first three months in office, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We owe our positions to the people,'' he said. ``People are
tired of being talked down to by their elected officials, and we
have to show results.''
</P>
<P>
   And with a presidential election coming up next year, the PRI
has to look to its young reformers to help shore up the party's
image, said Dr. Gary Mounce, a political science professor at the
University of Texas-Pan American in Edinburg.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to do it to win,'' he said. ``If they let the
(opposition parties) take the image of this moral force, they are
left with this old dinosaur image.''
</P>
<P>
   With the border leaders still settling into their jobs, it may
be too early to separate the rhetoric from reality. But in Nuevo
Laredo, Garza's crusade, which is accompanied by hundreds of
anti-bribery posters urging citizens to say no to the ``mordida,''
is winning converts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been very, very tough,'' said Ernesto Ferrara Theriot, a
city councilman and member of the opposition PAN party. ``This is
the first time we've seen this (type of reform). The last three
years we've had such a corrupt administration, (but) we cannot keep
protecting these types of individuals. They're a bunch of rats.''
</P>
<P>
   In the space of a few hours on a Thursday afternoon in late
April, Garza held an impromptu town-hall meeting with about 50
angry colonia residents demanding basic water and electricity for
their neighborhood, then joined the City Council in filing a formal
complaint accusing the ex-mayor of embezzling public money.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by sign-waving residents of the Los Arcos colonia,
Garza ordered police to arrest the man who had sold land in the
neighborhood without the required utilities. Local officials
estimate that 30 percent to 40 percent of the city's roughly
250,000 residents lack basic services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to continue permitting it,'' Garza said to
huge applause.
</P>
<P>
   Santos Mendoza, the colonia president, said residents have lived
in the former watermelon field without basic services for six
years. Their pleas to the last administration went nowhere, he
said, but they like what they see in Garza so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``This mayor came in with a lot of energy,'' Mendoza said.
</P>
<P>
   Garza said he has received threats as a result of his purge of
the police force, but now in his second stint as mayor _ he
previously served from 1993 to 1995 _ he said he is determined to
scrub Nuevo Laredo's image as a grimy, sometimes dangerous border
town.
</P>
<P>
   He has set his sights on sprucing up the city's bustling
downtown, pushing a plan to renovate the buildings in the six-block
tourist corridor stretching from the international bridge, widen
the sidewalks and perhaps close the street to make a pedestrian
mall after the new international bridge opens upstream next year.
</P>
<P>
   Similar revitalizing plans have sat rolled up on city shelves
for nine years, but Cristobal Enriquez, the city's director of
planning and urban development, said Garza could be the mayor to
push them through.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a very determined man,'' Enriquez said, ``and I have a
lot of confidence in him.''

 &HT;    Greenery of life returns to Everglades
 &HT;    By Robert P. King
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE EVERGLADES, Fla. _ The black peat lies almost naked to the
sky, except for an ocher stubble of charred saw grass. Snail shells
litter the ground. Above them stand burned willow husks, branching
like gnarled candelabra.
</P>
<P>
   In the central Everglades, reminders of fire and death linger
like the sulfur smell in the breeze.
</P>
<P>
   But so do signs of new life.
</P>
<P>
   Saw grass shoots, an almost fluorescent green, sprout 8 inches
above the soil. Leaves fan out from the base of the dead trunks.
</P>
<P>
   And scooping his fingers into the peaty muck _ dry enough on the
surface to send ash clouds puffing from every footfall _ Mike
Anderson can feel moistness in the earth.
</P>
<P>
   The moisture may have saved the peat, built up over thousands of
years from the tissue of dying plants. That means hope for recovery
from the wildfires of the past month, which swept across 170,000
acres of state-owned Everglades marsh in northwest Broward County.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you lose the peat, the only way to build it back up is
waiting hundreds of years,'' said Anderson, a biologist for the
Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission.
</P>
<P>
   That's still a big worry in roughly 2,500 acres of the burned
territory, where the fire gouged 8- to 10-inch-deep scars that may
need 1,000 years to heal. About 900 acres still smoldered at the
end of last week.
</P>
<P>
   For most people, the fire's worst results were all the scary
television images and the smoke that shrouded the Miami area while
closing Alligator Alley. But for biologists and conservationists,
the fire posed an even greater threat _ irreparable damage to a
part of the Everglades already ravaged by a flawed drainage system
and by the disastrous fires of the 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   This time, their worst fears didn't materialize.
</P>
<P>
   Despite months of meager rain, most of the region was just moist
enough to keep the fire from burning the peat. Where the muck
caught fire, foresters worked with South Florida water managers to
flood the region with canal runoff. Now, nature is donning a green
coat to replace what the fire scraped away.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the greenest I've ever seen saw grass,'' said Suzanne
Congelosi, senior forester for the state Division of Forestry.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Moller, a board member of the Florida Wildlife Federation,
calls the wildfire the most benign he's ever seen in the
Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   ``In another four to five weeks, it's going to be hard to tell
it really burned unless you've seen it earlier,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are especially pleased that the fire spared the
region's myriad tree islands, teardrop-shaped elevations that
harbor bird rookeries teeming with willows, wax myrtles, ficus and
rubber trees. Anderson said the fire burned the edges of only two
islands.
</P>
<P>
   Fire, a necessary part of the Everglades' life cycle, could even
help some species, game commission biologist Jim Schortemeyer said.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny sprouts of razor-edged saw grass are less fearsome than
the full-grown version, so deer can easily uproot them and munch on
the bottoms. Wildlife-nourishing plants such as duck potato, with
leaves like an upright spear, will have less competition for
sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   But alligators may have more trouble finding saw grass for their
nests, Schortemeyer said.
</P>
<P>
   And not all growth is good for the Everglades, which has already
been weakened by pollution and drainage.
</P>
<P>
   In a stretch of burned muck, singed cattails stand like waiting
invaders along the edges of a pool of black water. They grow in
thick clumps that offer little room for wading birds, and they
thrive in burned and polluted areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``What might happen in a year from now is this whole area will
fill with cattails,'' Anderson said as he drove an amphibious
all-terrain vehicle across the water. ``It's going to be a
population explosion.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the water pumped in to douse the muck fire could carry some
risks. Much of the water originated on cattle and sugar fields, a
source of fertilizer and manure nutrients, and lime-green algae
suds the surface in some areas.
</P>
<P>
   Still, experts say the fire could have been much worse.
</P>
<P>
   In past years, the foresters might have left the fire alone if
it didn't threaten humans, Congelosi said. Moller said firefighters
even worsened fires in the early 1970s by trying to plow muck over
the flames _ a technique that allowed the fire to spread
underground.

 &HT;    For better or worse, money matters
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Attention brides and grooms: Almost every married couple fights
about money. Among couples who don't fight, one partner often
seethes while the other spends.
</P>
<P>
   Money management is one of those little things that people don't
necessarily warn their children about.
</P>
<P>
   But trouble shouldn't be a surprise. Men and women often
disagree about money and its uses. A recent survey showed another
factor: Only one young person in every five has taken a course in
personal finance, and one of every six thinks that avoiding money
problems is mostly a matter of luck.
</P>
<P>
   And let's face it: Money is a natural thing to argue about. It's
important to our happiness, sometimes crucial to self-esteem and
always in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   Wise young people can minimize conflicts by following some
fairly simple guidelines. Check out these ideas:
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't keep secrets. It's a bad idea to conceal debts, and it's
a terrible idea to keep a secret stash of cash. Once married, you
are sharing your finances, as well as your lives. Surprises are
bad, in money or in minefields. Newlyweds should also share their
financial upbringing _ how their families handled money as they
grew up and the feelings they now have about money.
</P>
<P>
   _ Agree on goals. What do you _ both of you _ want to do first
with your money? It might be buying a car, or getting out of debt,
or saving up some cash to deal with the inevitable emergencies.
Make a list, setting out in order the things you want your money to
do for you.
</P>
<P>
   _ Develop a family budget. This will give you a sense of control
over your spending. It may also suggest places where you can
balance frivolous spending now against important things to save for
in the future. Some couples prepare for this by keeping money
diaries for a month, recording everything they spend. There is a
useful worksheet on the Internet at www.cccsatl.org/money.htm. You
type in your numbers, and the computer does the adding and
subtracting for you. The calculator has dozens of spending items,
so you're not likely to miss anything.
</P>
<P>
   When you get to the bottom line, you will be able to start
taking control. If you have extra cash at the end, you can start
using it to achieve goals. If you come up short, you have a way to
go back and look for places to cut back on spending.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep the conversation going. As your lives come together, your
priorities may change. So will your joint income. Couples need to
make sure they know how they are doing with their budget.
</P>
<P>
   _ Talk about bank accounts. Some couples toss all their money
into a joint account. Others prefer, at least at first, to have
separate accounts, or to have both. This decision seems obvious,
but it communicates a lot about the question of who controls
spending.
</P>
<P>
   _ Control your credit cards. The temptation to use them is
great, and spouses need to agree on limits.
</P>
<P>
   _ Designate a financial housekeeper. It's not terribly important
whether husband or wife balances the checkbook, pays the bills,
keeps the financial records and handles other routine chores. But
it is important that one person is responsible for getting it all
done.
</P>
<P>
   None of these is a particularly difficult chore. For many
couples, the hardest part is just getting started: talking openly
about money. It isn't at all romantic. But it beats fighting.

 &HT;    Let's treat the real problem _ adults _ not the kids
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ When folks tell me how kids have changed, I
listen with a jaundiced ear, because I'm hearing a lot of the same
things I heard from grownups half-a-century ago. And sometimes I
wonder who has really done the changing. Us or them?
</P>
<P>
   Fifty years ago we had a kid in our high school who liked to
blow up things. Dan started small with a couple of toilets in the
boys' restroom. Later he graduated to unoccupied houses on the
``wrong'' side of the tracks, and
</P>
<P>
   eventually, when he went for a bridge across the Miami River,
even his dad's lofty standing in the community couldn't keep him in
school and out of an institution.
</P>
<P>
   Dan was nobody's hero. He never made the six o'clock news (his
old man's clout probably kept him from it) and no reporters went
for in-depth coverage of his diaper days. Kids avoided him because
he was trouble.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Dan never received the reward he sought with his odd
behavior. He was denied his 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   So what's wrong with kids today?
</P>
<P>
   I dunno', but why don't we consider the possibility that maybe
it's not the kids. Maybe it's us.
</P>
<P>
   Kids don't own the movie studios that crank out the crud we're
raising such hell about, and how many porn magazines are published
by teens? Television? Show me a network owned and operated by
adolescents.
</P>
<P>
   When kids are unceremoniously dumped into this world, they're a
clean slate _ the ``tabula rasa'' psychologists and philosophers
frequently refer to as the minds not yet affected by experiences or
impressions. And then what happens?
</P>
<P>
   Life happens. Grownups happen.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers, when I was one, were shallow (totally concerned with
hair, clothes, and who had a cool car), insecure (Oh God, I'm
worthless), and egocentric (everybody is looking at ME). We
disobeyed our parents, made fun of our teachers, and disdained
adult authority. Teen-agers today are shallow, insecure, and
egocentric. They are disobedient and make fun of adults.
</P>
<P>
   So tell me...what's changed?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the role models.
</P>
<P>
   In Santa Fe, N.M., a 28-year-old mother of four is closing in on
her dream of operating her very own topless housecleaning service.
Yessiree, folks, these happy housekeepers will be doing their
dusting sans smock (and everything else) from the waist up. The
entrepreneur's husband will be happily looking after the couple's
children, ages 2 through 9, while his wife and her day ladies clean
up around town.
</P>
<P>
   The start-up is practically a done deal since there are no laws
on the books prohibiting such a venture. Now, the soon-to-be
mopping mogul is shopping insurance companies for coverage (pun
intended). She's found a few who may insure her service but they
need to do a bit of research first _ I'd suggest they start by
determining how many homes in the Santa Fe area still use wringer
washers.
</P>
<P>
   Now I ask you, is scrubbing a toilet topless really the
``American Dream'' we encourage our youth to pursue?
</P>
<P>
   Nice role model. Maybe her little ones can take her to school
for ``Show and Tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, federal and state governments are throwing millions
of dollars at the problem of at-risk kids. In addition to providing
identification and intervention for troubled youngsters, there are
funded programs designed to keep schools safe and drug free.
There's even an afternoon program to take kids off the streets
until someone gets home to look after them.
</P>
<P>
   We're doing all we can folks _ as long as we're locked into an
agenda that fails to identify the (SET ITAL)real(END ITAL) problem.
Maybe it's time we stop treating the symptom (kids) and go for the
illness (us).

 &HT;    What kids don't hear
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ When the TV is on, my youngest son is conditioned
to react to sexually connoted words and images with two words:
``Bye bye.''
</P>
<P>
   He's been on his toes a lot in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Were it not for Animal Planet, Cartoon Network and ``Brady
Bunch'' reruns on Nickelodeon, there would have been nothing on TV
this past year that didn't force him to leave the room.
</P>
<P>
   My older son built up his flexor muscles this year, in part
because he ousted the TV from his room but also because of the
gusto with which he flexed the remote every time he watched TV and
reference was made to the White House sex scandal _ push-button
thrusts sufficient to give him a wrist wrestler's forearm.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, combine all the material zapped in midsentence, and
you still have too much.
</P>
<P>
   History no doubt will see it all as a black mark. Gloria Feldt,
president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, realizes
that within it all is an opportunity for candor, ``a teachable
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's becoming impossible to exclude young people from the
conversation,'' she told an audience in Waco last week.
</P>
<P>
   If we've had a national dialogue in 1999, it's been of the
locker-room variety. And locker-room conversations never made
anyone smarter than the nearest roll of elastic wrap.
</P>
<P>
   Planned Parenthood is observing May, National Teen Pregnancy
Prevention Month, with an initiative and guide, ``Helping Teens
Make Responsible Choices'' _ emphasizing ways to prepare young
people to say no. Among the things featured is Planned Parenthood
of Central Texas' ``Nobody's Fool'' summer seminar on sexuality,
peer pressure and sound decisions.
</P>
<P>
   It's a reminder that conservatives and the Christian right do
not own the copyright on abstinence.
</P>
<P>
   Congress authorized $50 million in the 1996 welfare reform act
for abstinence education. That may have sounded good, but roughly
translated it has come to mean, ``Say no to sex _ and to
contraceptive education.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is dumb.
</P>
<P>
   One of the smartest things said about the subject recently came
from a movie star, of all people. Sharon Stone, participating in a
panel on AIDS and youth at the United Nations, said, ``No matter
how much we guide our children within our families, within our
churches, within our schools, we are not stronger than the power of
sexuality _ particularly to a teen-ager.'' She wasn't advocating
teen promiscuity. Face the biological facts, she was saying, and
manage them wisely.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush recently hailed a group of high schoolers
for making a vow of chastity until marriage. We can all heave a
sigh of relief for that group, and applaud lustily for making such
a choice. But it is their choice. Nobody can regulate it for them.
</P>
<P>
   Even they need to know how their bodies work and how in marriage
they can make parenthood an informed choice.
</P>
<P>
   But of course that would be a frank discussion of sex. And we
don't want to do that, frankly.
</P>
<P>
   Feldt compared America's run-from-the-discussion tendency to the
common-sense, just-the-facts attitude about sex education in the
Netherlands, which has a teen pregnancy rate one-ninth that of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that the Netherlands treats teen sexuality as
a public health issue and we treat it as a political geyser.
</P>
<P>
   Did someone say politics? Sex and politics? There you go. My
oldest has just used the zapper, and his brother has fled the room.
</P>

   MONEYTALK _ Attention brides and grooms: Almost every married
couple fights about money. Among couples who don't fight, one
partner often seethes while the other spends. Money management is
one of those little things that people don't necessarily warn their
children about. A recent survey showed another factor: Only one
young person in every five has taken a course in personal finance,
and one of every six thinks that avoiding money problems is mostly
a matter of luck. Money is a natural thing to argue about. It's
important to our happiness, sometimes crucial to self-esteem and
always in short supply. Wise young people can minimize conflicts by
following some fairly simple guidelines. (Ezell, Atlanta

 By JULIE L. BELCOVE 
 c.1999 Fairchild Publications  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Tony Goldwyn swears he was never one of those actors who really
want to direct.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no desire to direct,'' says Goldwyn, who, yes, is one of
the Goldwyns. ``I had always acted in movies and looked at the
director and thought, `Thank God that's not me.' They just always
had that 1,000-yard stare and looked besieged with problems. I
always thought, `I have this fun job of being an actor.'''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, his route to the director's chair on the set of ``A Walk
on the Moon,'' was a circuitous one. Goldwyn decided about four
years ago that taking on the role of producer and developing
material for himself _ would boost his acting career.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a moment of leverage _ when a movie's making a
lot of money at the box office _ that's the time to capitalize on
things,'' says Goldwyn, who had one of those moments when he played
the villain in 1990s ``Ghost'' and was determined to have a project
ready to go the next time lightning struck.
</P>
<P>
   While reading through stacks of screenplays, he came across ``A
Walk on the Moon,'' a story about a young housewife in a Catskills'
summer resort who undergoes a sexual awakening in the tumultuous
summer of '69. Goldwyn couldn't really see himself playing either
the betrayed husband or the hippie lover, but the script captivated
him nonetheless, and after meeting its author, Pamela Gray, he
agreed to produce it.
</P>
<P>
   He set Gray to work on rewrites and spent the next six months
looking for a director. ``I got really cold feet about everyone I
met. I was getting a massage one day,'' he says, laughing at
himself, ``laying on the table, and I just went, `Oh, I've got to
do this myself.' Literally, it was like a flash from God or
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldwyn may have been a rookie as a director, but he was no babe
in Hollywood. As grandson of both legendary producer Samuel Goldwyn
and screenwriter Sidney Howard, son of art-film producer Samuel
Goldwyn Jr., and brother of Paramount Motion Pictures president
John Goldwyn, Tony Goldwyn knew a thing or two about how to get a
movie made.
</P>
<P>
   As luck would have it, just as Goldwyn had decided not to try to
rush a deal, his agent called to tell him Dustin Hoffman's Punch
Productions wanted to talk. ``And suddenly we were in business,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Hoffman was interested in directing the movie himself
but deferred to Goldwyn. They collaborated on casting, signing
Diane Lane for the lead and Liev Schreiber and Anna Paquin for her
husband and teenage daughter. Goldwyn was intent on having Viggo
Mortensen play Lane's lover, and when the actor pulled out of
another movie, he saw his chance. ``I couldn't really speak in the
meeting because I was so shaken at how right this guy was,''
Goldwyn says.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman watched the dailies, FedExed from location in Canada,
and gave Goldwyn advice by phone. But he stayed away from both the
set and the editing room. ``I had so much respect for the work Tony
did,'' he explains. ``He has certain things you have to have, and
that's intelligence, focus, tremendous energy and real passion. And
humanity doesn't hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldwyn relied on the crew for their technical knowledge and
spent a good deal of time just talking to the cast. Hoffman says he
had a natural ability to relate to the actors, helping them deliver
strong performances. About halfway through the shoot, Diane Lane
remembers, she asked Goldwyn how he managed to please everyone and
``never lose his cool once _ never.'' He replied that from his
years of experience as an actor he had imagined his ideal director
and told her, ``That's what I'm playing.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the filmmaking process proved easier than
Goldwyn's initial efforts to break into acting in the early 80s.
When he first fell in love with acting in high school, he was a
little disappointed in himself: He hadn't wanted to go into the
family business. In a kind of compromise, he moved to New York
after acting school in London. In the theater world, the name
didn't carry much clout, which he says suited him fine, as did
acting on the stage.
</P>
<P>
   But after several years as a working actor, if not a prominent
one, Goldwyn returned to L.A and landed frequent TV roles on
``Murphy Brown,'' ``Designing Women,'' ``St. Elsewhere'' and ``L.A.
Law.'' He had less luck in movies. ``In L.A., I would walk into an
audition], and they'd go, `How's your dad?' or `We had lunch with
your brother the other day,''' Goldwyn says, cringing at the
memory. ``They'd assume you were a dilettante kid who didn't really
know what you wanted to do, so you said, `Oh, I'll be an actor.' I
worked really hard. I felt very frustrated to be dismissed in that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   His big break came with ``Ghost.'' ``I forced my way into an
audition,'' he recalls. The movie was a huge hit worldwide, and
Goldwyn, with his chiseled features, melting blue eyes and serious
actor credentials, seemed poised for stardom. But he says, ``I
always felt like I was wearing someone else's clothes. I had no
instinct for being a movie star.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade after ``Ghost,'', he's still being typecast as the
good-looking villain. ``It's funny he plays such convincing bad
guys,'' says Diane Lane, ``because he's the most charming, gentle
person.'' Although he is developing three projects to direct,
because of time constraints, Goldwyn says he has no plans to give
up acting entirely. Nor does the 38-year-old intend to leave
suburban Connecticut, where he makes his home away from the
limelight with his wife, production designer Jane Musky, and their
two young daughters, Anna and Tess. Even his mother, when she was
dying of cancer, cautioned that he needed to become more adept at
playing the game. But Goldwyn has no regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever opportunities I have missed as an actor I'll make up
for in spades in breadth and depth, as opposed to this obsession
with being hot, which you get into in L.A.,'' he says. ``I really
believe you have to decide how you want your life to go, and you
have to be true to that.''  &QL;   &QL;

<P>
   Tony Goldwyn swears he was never one of those actors who really
want to direct.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no desire to direct,'' says Goldwyn, who, yes, is one of
the Goldwyns. ``I had always acted in movies and looked at the
director and thought, `Thank God that's not me.' They just always
had that 1,000-yard stare and looked besieged with problems. I
always thought, `I have this fun job of being an actor.'''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, his route to the director's chair on the set of ``A Walk
on the Moon,'' was a circuitous one. Goldwyn decided about four
years ago that taking on the role of producer and developing
material for himself _ would boost his acting career.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a moment of leverage _ when a movie's making a
lot of money at the box office _ that's the time to capitalize on
things,'' says Goldwyn, who had one of those moments when he played
the villain in 1990s ``Ghost'' and was determined to have a project
ready to go the next time lightning struck.
</P>
<P>
   While reading through stacks of screenplays, he came across ``A
Walk on the Moon,'' a story about a young housewife in a Catskills'
summer resort who undergoes a sexual awakening in the tumultuous
summer of '69. Goldwyn couldn't really see himself playing either
the betrayed husband or the hippie lover, but the script captivated
him nonetheless, and after meeting its author, Pamela Gray, he
agreed to produce it.
</P>
<P>
   He set Gray to work on rewrites and spent the next six months
looking for a director. ``I got really cold feet about everyone I
met. I was getting a massage one day,'' he says, laughing at
himself, ``laying on the table, and I just went, `Oh, I've got to
do this myself.' Literally, it was like a flash from God or
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldwyn may have been a rookie as a director, but he was no babe
in Hollywood. As grandson of both legendary producer Samuel Goldwyn
and screenwriter Sidney Howard, son of art-film producer Samuel
Goldwyn Jr., and brother of Paramount Motion Pictures president
John Goldwyn, Tony Goldwyn knew a thing or two about how to get a
movie made.
</P>
<P>
   As luck would have it, just as Goldwyn had decided not to try to
rush a deal, his agent called to tell him Dustin Hoffman's Punch
Productions wanted to talk. ``And suddenly we were in business,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Hoffman was interested in directing the movie himself
but deferred to Goldwyn. They collaborated on casting, signing
Diane Lane for the lead and Liev Schreiber and Anna Paquin for her
husband and teenage daughter. Goldwyn was intent on having Viggo
Mortensen play Lane's lover, and when the actor pulled out of
another movie, he saw his chance. ``I couldn't really speak in the
meeting because I was so shaken at how right this guy was,''
Goldwyn says.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman watched the dailies, FedExed from location in Canada,
and gave Goldwyn advice by phone. But he stayed away from both the
set and the editing room. ``I had so much respect for the work Tony
did,'' he explains. ``He has certain things you have to have, and
that's intelligence, focus, tremendous energy and real passion. And
humanity doesn't hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldwyn relied on the crew for their technical knowledge and
spent a good deal of time just talking to the cast. Hoffman says he
had a natural ability to relate to the actors, helping them deliver
strong performances. About halfway through the shoot, Diane Lane
remembers, she asked Goldwyn how he managed to please everyone and
``never lose his cool once _ never.'' He replied that from his
years of experience as an actor he had imagined his ideal director
and told her, ``That's what I'm playing.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the filmmaking process proved easier than
Goldwyn's initial efforts to break into acting in the early 80s.
When he first fell in love with acting in high school, he was a
little disappointed in himself: He hadn't wanted to go into the
family business. In a kind of compromise, he moved to New York
after acting school in London. In the theater world, the name
didn't carry much clout, which he says suited him fine, as did
acting on the stage.
</P>
<P>
   But after several years as a working actor, if not a prominent
one, Goldwyn returned to L.A and landed frequent TV roles on
``Murphy Brown,'' ``Designing Women,'' ``St. Elsewhere'' and ``L.A.
Law.'' He had less luck in movies. ``In L.A., I would walk into an
audition], and they'd go, `How's your dad?' or `We had lunch with
your brother the other day,''' Goldwyn says, cringing at the
memory. ``They'd assume you were a dilettante kid who didn't really
know what you wanted to do, so you said, `Oh, I'll be an actor.' I
worked really hard. I felt very frustrated to be dismissed in that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   His big break came with ``Ghost.'' ``I forced my way into an
audition,'' he recalls. The movie was a huge hit worldwide, and
Goldwyn, with his chiseled features, melting blue eyes and serious
actor credentials, seemed poised for stardom. But he says, ``I
always felt like I was wearing someone else's clothes. I had no
instinct for being a movie star.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade after ``Ghost,'', he's still being typecast as the
good-looking villain. ``It's funny he plays such convincing bad
guys,'' says Diane Lane, ``because he's the most charming, gentle
person.'' Although he is developing three projects to direct,
because of time constraints, Goldwyn says he has no plans to give
up acting entirely. Nor does the 38-year-old intend to leave
suburban Connecticut, where he makes his home away from the
limelight with his wife, production designer Jane Musky, and their
two young daughters, Anna and Tess. Even his mother, when she was
dying of cancer, cautioned that he needed to become more adept at
playing the game. But Goldwyn has no regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever opportunities I have missed as an actor I'll make up
for in spades in breadth and depth, as opposed to this obsession
with being hot, which you get into in L.A.,'' he says. ``I really
believe you have to decide how you want your life to go, and you
have to be true to that.''  &QL;   &QL;

 &HT;    
 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It still sounds like an unlikely recipe for a bestseller. A
divorced middle-aged college professor and her new companion take
much of their life savings and purchase a crumbing 13-room house in
Italy. The 200-year old Tuscan farmhouse, called ``Bramasole,'' was
``tall, square and apricot-colored with faded green shutters,
ancient tile roof and an iron balcony on the second level'' and
needed a major renovation that is painstakingly detailed. Between
reconstructing stone walls and plumbing systems, there is much talk
of eating, drinking wine and the glories of small-town Tuscan life.
 &HT;    The book, of course, was Frances Mayes' ``Under the Tuscan Sun''
(Broadway, 1997; $14), which has spent over 83 weeks on ``The New
York Times'' paperback bestseller list and has more than a million
copies in print.
 &HT;    ``I thought people would like it because it was about Italy and
food and houses and travel,'' Mayes said in a recent phone
interview from her home in San Francisco. ``But it seems like a
great many people identified with taking a risk in mid-life, with
starting over. I didn't know that it would be picked up so
strongly.''
 &HT;    Mayes, who was born in Fitzgerald, Georgia, still speaks with
the softest of Southern accents, despite living in San Francisco
since the early 1970s. A professor of creative writing at San
Francisco State University, where she has directed the Poetry
Center and chaired the Department of Creative Writing, she has
written five books of poetry and has just published ``Bella
Tuscany: The Sweet Life in Italy'' (Broadway, 1999; $25). In the
new book, she chronicles a season at Bramasole that a sabbatical
allows her and her now-husband, Ed Kleinschmidt, to enjoy.
 &HT;    ``I'm in a rural part of Tuscany and some people think I
idealize it,'' Mayes says. ``I don't. When I get there, something
heavy slides away. It feels euphoric.''
 &HT;    The major restoration work done, she writes about the rural
pleasures that colored her first book, travels to Sicily and Venice
and Lago Trasimeno, and throws open the doors once again to a
lifestyle that so many readers found enticing. One that seems
worlds away from her urban lifestyle in San Francisco.
 &HT;    ``I think the Italians have done better with the 20th century
than we have,'' Mayes says. ``They have a different sense of time,
even in their urban environments. In Cortona, where we live,
there's a very cohesive population. There's an intense sense of
community. I feel very disassociated from that in my American life.
I think everyone's feeling the want of that. But in Italy, as a
stranger, a foreigner, I get to experience that and it makes me
feel at home.''
 &HT;    It seems like a timeless world where Mayes can devote endless
days to gardening, or marketing or taking long drives in pursuit of
wine from a local grower's collective. But in the nine years since
she has bought Bramasole, Mayes says that she has done more than
simply enjoy her summer days there.
 &HT;    ``I've written two books and restored the house and done lots of
gardening,'' she points out. ''I think the siesta is why the days
seem long. They're nicely balanced. I get up early and work and
then the siesta goes from 1:30 to about 4:30. It's like two days.
It's the best time of day and I get a lot of reading done. And it
feels familiar. I grew up in the south and my parents always faded
after lunch. Down in south Georgia, they still had a big midday
meal.''
 &HT;    Mayes loves reading ''that whole genre of travel narrative. I
love Ann Cornelisen's work and I dedicated my first book to her. I
also love Freya Stark, going into Arabia when no man, let alone
woman, would go there.''
 &HT;    Readers of ``Under the Tuscan Sun'' will not be surprised to
learn that food and its role in daily Italian life feature
prominently in Mayes' new work. In ``Bella Tuscany,'' she
rhapsodizes about artichokes and tomatoes, asparagus and wild
almonds, of meals that last for hours and the pleasures of
discovering an edible plant she'd previously never heard of. She
also recounts a trip through Sicily and gives the impression that
she is traveling through an entirely different country.
 &HT;    ``Italy feels so diverse in so many ways,'' Mayes says. ``The
north of Italy is very different from Tuscany and from Apulia in
the south. It's like different countries everywhere. Remember that
Italy was chopped up into little fiefdoms. Sicily is even more
extreme.''
 &HT;    Mayes has taken a year off from San Francisco State to work on a
novel that's set in Georgia. She says she's about halfway through
it and hopes to finish it by December. She admits that she's had
her share of people writing to her and even dropping by unannounced
at her house in Tuscany, entranced by her story. But she's quick to
add that they ``have not been invasive.''
 &HT;    As for Mayes' Italian, it's getting better, she says, noting
that she and her husband study with a tutor twice a week.
 &HT;    ``But I'm probably murdering the language two-thirds of the
time,`` she confesses.

 By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Colorado's San Juan Skyway is one of six All-American highways
cited for their superior and stunning scenic beauty.
 &HT;    A pair of septuagenarian friends _ Joan Dunlop and Vesta Foster
_ from Fort Collins, Colo., had a hankering to tour the renowned
mountain loop traversing the state's southwestern corner, and
recently did just that.
 &HT;    The preferred months for seniors traveling to this alpine region
are during the cooler months of June, September and October. For
wildflower buffs, July is prime, while June boasts lovely green
aspens which peak golden come September.
 &HT;    Since weather is always iffy in the mountains, Dunlop and Foster
packed clothes for cool nights and hot days, with layers suitable
for any situation short of a sudden _ and highly unlikely _
blizzard. They brought plenty of high-altitude gear: brimmed hats,
sun screen _ SPF No. 30 _ and water bottles to keep well-hydrated
in the dry air. To avoid altitude sickness (headaches are a common
symptom), Dunlop and Foster limited themselves to one glass of wine
with dinner and advise lowlanders to minimize activities for the
first few days to acclimate to the thin air.
 &HT;    
 ON THE ROAD AGAIN  
 &HT;    Although both Dunlop and Foster normally drive manual sticks,
they rented an automatic for that extra kick, and were happy with
the results when it came to passing lumbering RVs and trucks on
steep inclines. Lucky for agoraphobic Dunlop, her pal Foster is an
experienced mountain driver who didn't mind navigating narrow,
twisty roads with sheer drop-offs.
 &HT;    
 FINE B &AMP; Bs  
 &HT;    The duo found a number of fine bed-and-breakfast inns along the
Skyway. None with elevators, but if stairs pose a problem, they
suggest asking for a first floor room.
 &HT;    To ensure a nightly room, they referenced ''Bed &AMP; Breakfast
Innkeepers of Colorado'' and ''Inns of the San Juan Skyway.'' After
selecting a mutually satisfying accommodation, they called the
inn's 800 number, bypassing the central reservations number
(800/962-2493), preferring the personal touch of speaking with the
innkeepers directly.
 &HT;    The ''Bed &AMP; Breakfast Innkeepers of Colorado'' can be obtained
by calling 800/636-2242. For ''Inns of the San Juan Skyway,'' call
800/962-2493. For maps or tour books, call the San Juan National
Forest at 970/247-4874 or the Uncompahgre National Forest at
970/874-6600. Or visit the website at http://sanjuanskyway.com.
 &HT;    
 DAY ONE  
 &HT;    Ouray, located in a red-walled canyon, was the first stop. It
was late afternoon, and the pair's home for the night was the China
Clipper (800/315-0561), a new Victorian-style house on a hill. Many
steps led to the house, but they parked in back and entered on
ground level where their room was located.
 &HT;    Morning found them hiking to Box Canyon Falls, on the edge of
town. There, they enjoyed a breath-taking of Ouray and its majestic
surrounding peaks. Later, they took a jeep tour of nearby back
roads.
 &HT;    
 DAY TWO  
 &HT;    The Million Dollar Highway _ a continuation of U.S. 550 on the
Skyway _ led them to Silverton which lies at 9,318 feet in a
caldera of a dormant volcano. This former mining town boasts a
summer-population of 550, and a stalwart winter population of less
than 225. Nearby, Old 100 Mine and Mayflower Gold Mill are
worthwhile tours.
 &HT;    On the National Register of Historic Places, the Wyman Hotel
(800/609-7845) has been lovingly restored. However, Dunlop and
Foster discovered the building's pipes and plumbing were less than
silent and highly recommend ear plugs, unless you like the sound of
people showering at 5 a.m.
 &HT;    To take the historic narrow-gauge train between Silverton and
Durango, Dunlop and Foster rode a 7:30 a.m. bus to Durango, then
hopped the 9 o'clock train back t Silverton, arriving at 12:30. By
buying a ticket well in advance, riders can get a seat in a
restored, enclosed, turn-of-the-century car. But if the weather is
good, consider the open gondolas with their unobstructed views of
the Animas River and the bracing perfume of evergreens dotting the
nearby hills.
 &HT;    The Skyway between the Silverton and Durango offers more alpine
vistas. Red cliffs herald Durango on the edge of mountains, the
largest city in the San Juans, with its intriguing mix of
cosmopolitan and cowboy ambiance. South of town is Lightner Creek
Inn (800/268-9804), the movie City Slickers was filmed nearby.
North is Apple Orchard Inn (800/426-0751), with gardens and trout
ponds, and near Trimble Hot Springs for a relaxing soak.
 &HT;    
 TRIP TO TELLURIDE  
 &HT;    Dunlop and Foster elected to visit Mesa Verde en route to
Telluride, taking U.S. 160 to the entrance to the park, where,
rather than worry about parking, they joined a tour of the kivas
and cliff dwellings, lunching at Farview Lodge.
 &HT;    Colorado Route 145 carried them through flat sage lands, slowly
climbing along the Dolores River to the short road into 8,745-foot
high Telluride, another box canyon, with only one way in or out.
Snow peaks rise above the end of Colorado Avenue, the main street.
A sky-blue Victorian, the Alpine Inn (800/707-3344), was their home
that night, where the breakfast sun room looks out on the new
gondola.
 &HT;    The gondola, absolutely free, takes passengers to a corral of
picnic tables and a noontime barbecue, then goes over the mountain
to the posh ski resort, Mountain Village.
 &HT;    On a history tour of town, Dunlop and Foster learned there are
350 miles of mountain tunnels. It was here that Butch Cassidy
robbed his first bank with such successful results, he made bank
robbery his full-time career.
 &HT;    Continuing northwest from Telluride, at Sawpit they tooled up a
steep gravel road to a broad valley for some smashing views of the
San Juan peaks across a meadow of lupines. The road came out onto
CO 62, where they followed the designer fence of Ralph Lauren's
ranch to Ridgway, the site of beautiful Chipeta Sun Lodge, a spa.
 &HT;    Dunlop and Foster's adventurous excursion shows just how easy it
is to discover travel treasures _ right in our own backyards.

 &HT;    
 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It still sounds like an unlikely recipe for a bestseller. A
divorced middle-aged college professor and her new companion take
much of their life savings and purchase a crumbing 13-room house in
Italy. The 200-year old Tuscan farmhouse, called ``Bramasole,'' was
``tall, square and apricot-colored with faded green shutters,
ancient tile roof and an iron balcony on the second level'' and
needed a major renovation that is painstakingly detailed. Between
reconstructing stone walls and plumbing systems, there is much talk
of eating, drinking wine and the glories of small-town Tuscan life.
 &HT;    The book, of course, was Frances Mayes' ``Under the Tuscan Sun''
(Broadway, 1997; $14), which has spent over 83 weeks on ``The New
York Times'' paperback bestseller list and has more than a million
copies in print.
 &HT;    ``I thought people would like it because it was about Italy and
food and houses and travel,'' Mayes said in a recent phone
interview from her home in San Francisco. ``But it seems like a
great many people identified with taking a risk in mid-life, with
starting over. I didn't know that it would be picked up so
strongly.''
 &HT;    Mayes, who was born in Fitzgerald, Georgia, still speaks with
the softest of Southern accents, despite living in San Francisco
since the early 1970s. A professor of creative writing at San
Francisco State University, where she has directed the Poetry
Center and chaired the Department of Creative Writing, she has
written five books of poetry and has just published ``Bella
Tuscany: The Sweet Life in Italy'' (Broadway, 1999; $25). In the
new book, she chronicles a season at Bramasole that a sabbatical
allows her and her now-husband, Ed Kleinschmidt, to enjoy.
 &HT;    ``I'm in a rural part of Tuscany and some people think I
idealize it,'' Mayes says. ``I don't. When I get there, something
heavy slides away. It feels euphoric.''
 &HT;    The major restoration work done, she writes about the rural
pleasures that colored her first book, travels to Sicily and Venice
and Lago Trasimeno, and throws open the doors once again to a
lifestyle that so many readers found enticing. One that seems
worlds away from her urban lifestyle in San Francisco.
 &HT;    ``I think the Italians have done better with the 20th century
than we have,'' Mayes says. ``They have a different sense of time,
even in their urban environments. In Cortona, where we live,
there's a very cohesive population. There's an intense sense of
community. I feel very disassociated from that in my American life.
I think everyone's feeling the want of that. But in Italy, as a
stranger, a foreigner, I get to experience that and it makes me
feel at home.''
 &HT;    It seems like a timeless world where Mayes can devote endless
days to gardening, or marketing or taking long drives in pursuit of
wine from a local grower's collective. But in the nine years since
she has bought Bramasole, Mayes says that she has done more than
simply enjoy her summer days there.
 &HT;    ``I've written two books and restored the house and done lots of
gardening,'' she points out. ''I think the siesta is why the days
seem long. They're nicely balanced. I get up early and work and
then the siesta goes from 1:30 to about 4:30. It's like two days.
It's the best time of day and I get a lot of reading done. And it
feels familiar. I grew up in the south and my parents always faded
after lunch. Down in south Georgia, they still had a big midday
meal.''
 &HT;    Mayes loves reading ''that whole genre of travel narrative. I
love Ann Cornelisen's work and I dedicated my first book to her. I
also love Freya Stark, going into Arabia when no man, let alone
woman, would go there.''
 &HT;    Readers of ``Under the Tuscan Sun'' will not be surprised to
learn that food and its role in daily Italian life feature
prominently in Mayes' new work. In ``Bella Tuscany,'' she
rhapsodizes about artichokes and tomatoes, asparagus and wild
almonds, of meals that last for hours and the pleasures of
discovering an edible plant she'd previously never heard of. She
also recounts a trip through Sicily and gives the impression that
she is traveling through an entirely different country.
 &HT;    ``Italy feels so diverse in so many ways,'' Mayes says. ``The
north of Italy is very different from Tuscany and from Apulia in
the south. It's like different countries everywhere. Remember that
Italy was chopped up into little fiefdoms. Sicily is even more
extreme.''
 &HT;    Mayes has taken a year off from San Francisco State to work on a
novel that's set in Georgia. She says she's about halfway through
it and hopes to finish it by December. She admits that she's had
her share of people writing to her and even dropping by unannounced
at her house in Tuscany, entranced by her story. But she's quick to
add that they ``have not been invasive.''
 &HT;    As for Mayes' Italian, it's getting better, she says, noting
that she and her husband study with a tutor twice a week.
 &HT;    ``But I'm probably murdering the language two-thirds of the
time,`` she confesses.

 &HT;    
 By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Colorado's San Juan Skyway is one of six All-American highways
cited for their superior and stunning scenic beauty.
 &HT;    A pair of septuagenarian friends _ Joan Dunlop and Vesta Foster
_ from Fort Collins, Colo., had a hankering to tour the renowned
mountain loop traversing the state's southwestern corner, and
recently did just that.
 &HT;    The preferred months for seniors traveling to this alpine region
are during the cooler months of June, September and October. For
wildflower buffs, July is prime, while June boasts lovely green
aspens which peak golden come September.
 &HT;    Since weather is always iffy in the mountains, Dunlop and Foster
packed clothes for cool nights and hot days, with layers suitable
for any situation short of a sudden _ and highly unlikely _
blizzard. They brought plenty of high-altitude gear: brimmed hats,
sun screen _ SPF No. 30 _ and water bottles to keep well-hydrated
in the dry air. To avoid altitude sickness (headaches are a common
symptom), Dunlop and Foster limited themselves to one glass of wine
with dinner and advise lowlanders to minimize activities for the
first few days to acclimate to the thin air.
 &HT;    
 ON THE ROAD AGAIN  
 &HT;    Although both Dunlop and Foster normally drive manual sticks,
they rented an automatic for that extra kick, and were happy with
the results when it came to passing lumbering RVs and trucks on
steep inclines. Lucky for agoraphobic Dunlop, her pal Foster is an
experienced mountain driver who didn't mind navigating narrow,
twisty roads with sheer drop-offs.
 &HT;    
 FINE B &AMP; Bs  
 &HT;    The duo found a number of fine bed-and-breakfast inns along the
Skyway. None with elevators, but if stairs pose a problem, they
suggest asking for a first floor room.
 &HT;    To ensure a nightly room, they referenced ''Bed &AMP; Breakfast
Innkeepers of Colorado'' and ''Inns of the San Juan Skyway.'' After
selecting a mutually satisfying accommodation, they called the
inn's 800 number, bypassing the central reservations number
(800/962-2493), preferring the personal touch of speaking with the
innkeepers directly.
 &HT;    The ''Bed &AMP; Breakfast Innkeepers of Colorado'' can be obtained
by calling 800/636-2242. For ''Inns of the San Juan Skyway,'' call
800/962-2493. For maps or tour books, call the San Juan National
Forest at 970/247-4874 or the Uncompahgre National Forest at
970/874-6600. Or visit the website at http://sanjuanskyway.com.
 &HT;    
 DAY ONE  
 &HT;    Ouray, located in a red-walled canyon, was the first stop. It
was late afternoon, and the pair's home for the night was the China
Clipper (800/315-0561), a new Victorian-style house on a hill. Many
steps led to the house, but they parked in back and entered on
ground level where their room was located.
 &HT;    Morning found them hiking to Box Canyon Falls, on the edge of
town. There, they enjoyed a breath-taking of Ouray and its majestic
surrounding peaks. Later, they took a jeep tour of nearby back
roads.
 &HT;    
 DAY TWO  
 &HT;    The Million Dollar Highway _ a continuation of U.S. 550 on the
Skyway _ led them to Silverton which lies at 9,318 feet in a
caldera of a dormant volcano. This former mining town boasts a
summer-population of 550, and a stalwart winter population of less
than 225. Nearby, Old 100 Mine and Mayflower Gold Mill are
worthwhile tours.
 &HT;    On the National Register of Historic Places, the Wyman Hotel
(800/609-7845) has been lovingly restored. However, Dunlop and
Foster discovered the building's pipes and plumbing were less than
silent and highly recommend ear plugs, unless you like the sound of
people showering at 5 a.m.
 &HT;    To take the historic narrow-gauge train between Silverton and
Durango, Dunlop and Foster rode a 7:30 a.m. bus to Durango, then
hopped the 9 o'clock train back t Silverton, arriving at 12:30. By
buying a ticket well in advance, riders can get a seat in a
restored, enclosed, turn-of-the-century car. But if the weather is
good, consider the open gondolas with their unobstructed views of
the Animas River and the bracing perfume of evergreens dotting the
nearby hills.
 &HT;    The Skyway between the Silverton and Durango offers more alpine
vistas. Red cliffs herald Durango on the edge of mountains, the
largest city in the San Juans, with its intriguing mix of
cosmopolitan and cowboy ambiance. South of town is Lightner Creek
Inn (800/268-9804), the movie City Slickers was filmed nearby.
North is Apple Orchard Inn (800/426-0751), with gardens and trout
ponds, and near Trimble Hot Springs for a relaxing soak.
 &HT;    
 TRIP TO TELLURIDE  
 &HT;    Dunlop and Foster elected to visit Mesa Verde en route to
Telluride, taking U.S. 160 to the entrance to the park, where,
rather than worry about parking, they joined a tour of the kivas
and cliff dwellings, lunching at Farview Lodge.

 &HT;    ---------------------------------------------------
 &HT;    
 By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Colorado's San Juan Skyway is one of six All-American highways
cited for their superior and stunning scenic beauty.
 &HT;    A pair of septuagenarian friends _ Joan Dunlop and Vesta Foster
_ from Fort Collins, Colo., had a hankering to tour the renowned
mountain loop traversing the state's southwestern corner, and
recently did just that.
 &HT;    The preferred months for seniors traveling to this alpine region
are during the cooler months of June, September and October. For
wildflower buffs, July is prime, while June boasts lovely green
aspens which peak golden come September.
 &HT;    Since weather is always iffy in the mountains, Dunlop and Foster
packed clothes for cool nights and hot days, with layers suitable
for any situation short of a sudden _ and highly unlikely _
blizzard. They brought plenty of high-altitude gear: brimmed hats,
sun screen _ SPF No. 30 _ and water bottles to keep well-hydrated
in the dry air. To avoid altitude sickness (headaches are a common
symptom), Dunlop and Foster limited themselves to one glass of wine
with dinner and advise lowlanders to minimize activities for the
first few days to acclimate to the thin air.
 &HT;    
 ON THE ROAD AGAIN  
 &HT;    Although both Dunlop and Foster normally drive manual sticks,
they rented an automatic for that extra kick, and were happy with
the results when it came to passing lumbering RVs and trucks on
steep inclines. Lucky for agoraphobic Dunlop, her pal Foster is an
experienced mountain driver who didn't mind navigating narrow,
twisty roads with sheer drop-offs.
 &HT;    
 FINE B &AMP; Bs  
 &HT;    The duo found a number of fine bed-and-breakfast inns along the
Skyway. None with elevators, but if stairs pose a problem, they
suggest asking for a first floor room.
 &HT;    To ensure a nightly room, they referenced ''Bed &AMP; Breakfast
Innkeepers of Colorado'' and ''Inns of the San Juan Skyway.'' After
selecting a mutually satisfying accommodation, they called the
inn's 800 number, bypassing the central reservations number
(800/962-2493), preferring the personal touch of speaking with the
innkeepers directly.
 &HT;    The ''Bed &AMP; Breakfast Innkeepers of Colorado'' can be obtained
by calling 800/636-2242. For ''Inns of the San Juan Skyway,'' call
800/962-2493. For maps or tour books, call the San Juan National
Forest at 970/247-4874 or the Uncompahgre National Forest at
970/874-6600. Or visit the website at http://sanjuanskyway.com.
 &HT;    
 DAY ONE  
 &HT;    Ouray, located in a red-walled canyon, was the first stop. It
was late afternoon, and the pair's home for the night was the China
Clipper (800/315-0561), a new Victorian-style house on a hill. Many
steps led to the house, but they parked in back and entered on
ground level where their room was located.
 &HT;    Morning found them hiking to Box Canyon Falls, on the edge of
town. There, they enjoyed a breath-taking of Ouray and its majestic
surrounding peaks. Later, they took a jeep tour of nearby back
roads.
 &HT;    
 DAY TWO  
 &HT;    The Million Dollar Highway _ a continuation of U.S. 550 on the
Skyway _ led them to Silverton which lies at 9,318 feet in a
caldera of a dormant volcano. This former mining town boasts a
summer-population of 550, and a stalwart winter population of less
than 225. Nearby, Old 100 Mine and Mayflower Gold Mill are
worthwhile tours.
 &HT;    On the National Register of Historic Places, the Wyman Hotel
(800/609-7845) has been lovingly restored. However, Dunlop and
Foster discovered the building's pipes and plumbing were less than
silent and highly recommend ear plugs, unless you like the sound of
people showering at 5 a.m.
 &HT;    To take the historic narrow-gauge train between Silverton and
Durango, Dunlop and Foster rode a 7:30 a.m. bus to Durango, then
hopped the 9 o'clock train back t Silverton, arriving at 12:30. By
buying a ticket well in advance, riders can get a seat in a
restored, enclosed, turn-of-the-century car. But if the weather is
good, consider the open gondolas with their unobstructed views of
the Animas River and the bracing perfume of evergreens dotting the
nearby hills.
 &HT;    The Skyway between the Silverton and Durango offers more alpine
vistas. Red cliffs herald Durango on the edge of mountains, the
largest city in the San Juans, with its intriguing mix of
cosmopolitan and cowboy ambiance. South of town is Lightner Creek
Inn (800/268-9804), the movie City Slickers was filmed nearby.
North is Apple Orchard Inn (800/426-0751), with gardens and trout
ponds, and near Trimble Hot Springs for a relaxing soak.
 &HT;    
 TRIP TO TELLURIDE  
 &HT;    Dunlop and Foster elected to visit Mesa Verde en route to
Telluride, taking U.S. 160 to the entrance to the park, where,
rather than worry about parking, they joined a tour of the kivas
and cliff dwellings, lunching at Farview Lodge.
 &HT;    Colorado Route 145 carried them through flat sage lands, slowly
climbing along the Dolores River to the short road into 8,745-foot
high Telluride, another box canyon, with only one way in or out.
Snow peaks rise above the end of Colorado Avenue, the main street.
A sky-blue Victorian, the Alpine Inn (800/707-3344), was their home
that night, where the breakfast sun room looks out on the new
gondola.
 &HT;    The gondola, absolutely free, takes passengers to a corral of
picnic tables and a noontime barbecue, then goes over the mountain
to the posh ski resort, Mountain Village.
 &HT;    On a history tour of town, Dunlop and Foster learned there are
350 miles of mountain tunnels. It was here that Butch Cassidy
robbed his first bank with such successful results, he made bank
robbery his full-time career.
 &HT;    Continuing northwest from Telluride, at Sawpit they tooled up a
steep gravel road to a broad valley for some smashing views of the
San Juan peaks across a meadow of lupines. The road came out onto
CO 62, where they followed the designer fence of Ralph Lauren's
ranch to Ridgway, the site of beautiful Chipeta Sun Lodge, a spa.
 &HT;    Dunlop and Foster's adventurous excursion shows just how easy it
is to discover travel treasures _ right in our own backyards.

   ENERGY: Private contractors of the Department of Energy -
including Allied Signal and Midwest Research Institute of Kansas
City - are doing little to curb excessive travel costs, a recent
government audit shows. The 32 contractors failed to meet the
department's 1995 goal to cut $35 million a year in travel.
Altogether, we footed $250 million for their travel last year. Some
firms show little interest in containing costs - paying $1,000 + on
airline tickets they could get for less than half that amount and
spending $300 a night on hotel rooms. Kevin Murphy. 28 inches.

   KIDS: The annual Kids Count survey is out again, and for the
first time, researchers have listed six risk factors in families
that often lead to bad outcomes for children. These include no
full-time worker in the family, parents who are dropouts, parents
on welfare, single parent families. Ten percent of Missouri
families and 8 percent of Kansas families meet the criteria for
``high-risk families,'' with at least four risk factors. These are
below the national average. Meanwhile, on the actual indicators of
child welfare, Kansas has slipped greatly over 15 years in having
more single parent families. Missouri kids are dropping out more
frequently. We localize the story at St. Vincent's child care
center, where the two nuns see lots of families with these risk
factors. Graphic. Donald Bradley. 20.

MORALES' CAREER STEEPED IN POLITICAL CONTROVERSY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ As state attorney general, Dan Morales was no
virgin in the hardball world of Texas politics.
</P>
<P>
   His boyish demeanor and strong popularity with the voters belied
a series of political controversies that often saw him at odds with
other Democratic leaders as well as Republican officeholders.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was the first Hispanic elected to a nonjudicial
statewide office in Texas, Morales alienated many minority
legislators by ruling against affirmative action programs at Texas
colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
   And he once even got into a shoving match with then-Lt. Gov. Bob
Bullock during a heated, private debate over redistricting.
</P>
<P>
   But most of Morales' political enemies would never have
predicted that the state's former top lawyer would stand accused of
doctoring contracts to help a friend get a big piece of the tobacco
settlement pie.
</P>
<P>
   His longtime supporters, meanwhile, were shocked when his
successor, Attorney General John Cornyn, raised the allegations in
a federal court filing this month.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Dusek, Morales' former press secretary, said he hopes that
pending investigations will show that Morales was guilty of nothing
worse than ``bad judgment and bungling.''
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the outcome, he added, ``A crowning achievement in
many persons' careers, especially Dan's, has been reduced to
shame.''
</P>
<P>
   Morales has angrily denied Cornyn's accusations, which stem from
his efforts to help Houston lawyer Marc Murr obtain hundreds of
millions of dollars in legal fees from the state's landmark, $17.3
billion tobacco settlement. Under investigation by Cornyn and the
FBI, Morales has declined further public comment, and so has Murr.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn, who succeeded Morales Jan. 1, contends that Morales and
Murr falsified signatures and backdated two purported contracts to
mislead a federal judge deciding on legal fees in the case.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of Cornyn's challenge, Murr abruptly withdrew a
claim for about $260 million awarded by a state arbitration panel,
which he and Morales had handpicked.
</P>
<P>
   But the Houston attorney _ who other lawyers say did little work
on the tobacco suit _ still is to receive $1 million in fees
payable by cigarette companies under a separate, national
arbitration award entered late last year.
</P>
<P>
   Some Morales associates say that Cornyn, a Republican, is trying
to bury his 43-year-old predecessor politically, to remove any
possibility that the former attorney general may someday re-enter
politics.
</P>
<P>
   When he voluntarily decided to retire from public office last
year, Morales was still one of the most popular Democrats in Texas.
He said he wanted to work in the private sector and spend more time
with his new wife, whom he married in 1997, and her two children.
But he didn't rule out the possibility of eventually returning to
public life to run for governor.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI and the U.S. attorney's office have refused to confirm
that there is an investigation, which Cornyn says is continuing.
Cornyn's office denies some reports that federal investigators have
concluded that there is nothing for them to prosecute.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Schaffer of Houston, president of the Texas Criminal
Defense Lawyers Association, said that backdating a contract isn't
necessarily criminal. Such an act depends on the intent of the
people who do the backdating and whether they are trying to deceive
others.
</P>
<P>
   If that is the case, he said, investigators may be studying the
Murr contracts for forgery or perhaps conspiracy or mail fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Morales' defenders note that he has repeatedly insisted that the
lawyers who helped him in the tobacco suit not be paid from the
state's share of the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could it be that Morales was trying to help Murr get a big fee
from tobacco because he disliked those companies so much?'' one
friend speculated.
</P>
<P>
   But that scenario, if true, was torpedoed when a national
arbitration panel, which decided how much the cigarette makers
would pay the lawyers, awarded Murr only $1 million. The additional
$259 million awarded Murr by the separate, state arbitration group
represented a potential claim against the state.
</P>
<P>
   A team of five other outside lawyers with whom Morales had a
well-known contingency contract was awarded $3.3 billion by the
national arbitrators.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on Morales' tenure as attorney general, Ed Martin, a
political consultant and former executive director of the Texas
Democratic Party, said he had his ``ups and downs'' with Morales
and often opposed him on issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``As attorney general, he cut his own path,'' Martin said, and
often disagreed with other Democrats on key issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, he was willing to go against leaders of his own
party (on matters of principle),'' Martin said. ``This doesn't
sound like somebody who would do something (illegal) for money.''
</P>
<P>
   While hoping the allegations against their former boss are
unfounded, some former Morales staffers are, nevertheless, clearly
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Potter, Morales' lead state lawyer in the tobacco suit,
and another former Morales staffer, in a meeting shortly before
Cornyn took office, discussed their ``reservations'' about Murr
with the new attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Another former high-level Morales staffer, who now works for
Cornyn, went to federal investigators about that same time.
</P>
<P>
   Potter, who reportedly has also been interviewed by the FBI, had
few contacts with Murr during the tobacco suit. He told Cornyn's
office that Murr admitted to him only a few weeks before the case
was settled in January 1998 that he didn't have a contract with the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Dusek, Morales' former press secretary, said that he, like most
other people, never knew about Murr's purported contract in the
tobacco suit until after the settlement was negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am now very disappointed and feel betrayed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, when Murr became a major controversy in the weeks
before Morales left office, Dusek was uncomfortable enough to
refuse to answer reporters' questions about the Houston lawyer. He
insisted that Morales personally answer all inquiries about Murr.
</P>
<P>
   Already considered by some to behave as a ``Lone Ranger'' who
often acted without consulting other officeholders, Morales was on
his own when he sued the tobacco industry in 1996 over
smoking-related health-care costs and cigarette-marketing
practices. He has said he didn't believe the suit would ever have
been filed if he had had to ask the Legislature's permission
because tobacco lobbyists would have killed the idea.
</P>
<P>
   He also kept Gov. George W. Bush and legislative leaders in the
dark as he negotiated the details of the tobacco settlement.
Consequently, some lawmakers ``harbored a suspicion that something
wasn't right on this,'' said one former legislative staffer, who
asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Those secretive habits _ plus Morales' tendency to evade
reporters' questions or to issue misleading statements while he was
in office _ may be compounding his troubles.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, for example, Morales repeatedly insisted that a
settlement agreement he had signed in the landmark prison-reform
lawsuit had ended federal court control over the Texas prison
system.
</P>
<P>
   But it became obvious that U.S. District Judge William Wayne
Justice had retained oversight when he ordered an investigation of
one prison unit, following an inmate's complaint that a softball
field had been destroyed to make room for prison expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had to ask (Morales) all the questions in the right order,
or you never got the full picture,'' the former legislative staffer
said.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation over Murr puts both Cornyn's and Morales'
reputations on the line.
</P>
<P>
   The initial reaction in state government, the former legislative
aide said, has been ``shock.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The general reaction has been in a nutshell that where there's
smoke, there's fire, and let's sit back and watch,'' he said.

FAMILIES BOND WHILE VACATIONING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Family travel specialist Eileen Ogintz sounds a request:
</P>
<P>
   ``Conjure up your happiest memories,'' she says. ``More often
than not, they center around a family vacation. That's because
these vacations represent more than just getting away from home.
They help us form family bonds. This is especially important today
when we are torn in so many directions.''
</P>
<P>
   Families are traveling together in record numbers, too. Indeed,
during a recent panel discussion about family travel in St.
Petersburg, Fla., Ogintz and other travel industry representatives
provided this food for thought (citing various sources):
</P>
<P>
   _ Americans now take more than 100 million trips annually with
at least one child, a 50 percent increase during the last 10 years.
Twenty percent of these journeys result in expenditures of at least
$2,000.
</P>
<P>
   _ Family travel is no longer a summer-only pastime. Sixteen
million parents take kids from the classroom during the school year
to accompany them on trips, and 40 percent of spring and fall
vacations include children.
</P>
<P>
   _ Thirty-two million annual business trips _ or 16 percent of
all business travel _ include a child.
</P>
<P>
   _ Multigenerational travel continues to expand in popularity; 16
million trips now include one or more grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   _ Single parents, who head one-third of U.S. families, are
vacationing with their kids in growing numbers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TEENS' BLESSINGS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And an eye-opening statistic cited by Ogintz: Among more than 21
million teen-agers in the United States, 60 percent sell parents on
the family's vacation choice.
</P>
<P>
   This last trend is attributed in part to today's youths
mastering the Internet _ and its travel-related sites and chat
rooms _ faster than many parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Mom and Dad are talking about taking a cruise, the kids
will go online and read about it and either give their blessing or
say, `This ship stinks,''' says Nancy Schretter, who operates the
Family Travel Network site for America Online subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once a decision is made about the cruise,'' Schretter
continues, ``the kids will get back online and say, `I'm going on
such-such ship. Who else is going to be there?' When they find kids
with like interests, they'll even arrange to meet onboard.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is enamored of kids' increased influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think all children know what a family vacation should
be,'' says Helena Koenig of Maryland-based Grandtravel. ``We have
to be careful about how much power we vest in children. Yes, our
children today have been exposed to more than those growing up 30
years ago. But an 11-year-old in any era is still an 11-year-old.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BROADER CHOICES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No matter the main decision-maker(s), family vacation choices
now extend far beyond the traditional and still-popular weekend
campout as cruise lines, resorts, even adventure tour companies
scramble to capture a share of the lucrative market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that the concept of family travel has changed,'' says
Koenig. ``I had five children. Did I ever go anywhere without them?
Of course not. But we stayed in a tent. What's happened is that
vendors have decided that it's OK to accept children. You even find
diapers and baby food on (upscale) Holland America cruise ships.''
</P>
<P>
   Half-a-million kids vacationed at sea last year. ``That
represents one of the biggest trends we're seeing in family
travel,'' says Ogintz.
</P>
<P>
   And the new Disney Cruise Line isn't alone in soliciting young
passengers. Carnival, Royal Caribbean, Princess, Norwegian and
other major lines offer extensive youth programs.
</P>
<P>
   Back on land, ``Almost every large resort has a kids program,''
says Laura Sutherland, author of several family-oriented books.
Though programs geared to ages 4-11 are most popular, many resorts
are exploring new ways to appeal to teens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Water parks are especially big at resorts,'' says Sutherland.
``Offshore platforms and swim-with-the-dolphin programs are
popular, too. Many resorts conduct lessons for kids in tennis, golf
and snorkeling. Some have photography lessons for kids. And I've
seen programs in children's etiquette.''
</P>
<P>
   Resorts also are emphasizing family travel through pricing
schemes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We frequently see promotions through which kids eat free or
that offer a second room for half-price,'' says Sutherland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of all, families just want to know when planning a trip
that their kids will be welcomed. Look at Club Med: It's changed
its entire image from a singles village to a family village.''
</P>
<P>
   The adventure-travel boon has impacted families, too. Based on
studies cited by Ogintz, 40 million families have taken an
adventure-oriented vacation in the past five years. More than half
camped, hiked or fished last summer. More than half of snowboarders
and one-fourth of skiers are under 18.
</P>
<P>
   At Grandtravel, a company that books only kids and grandparents
(with parents not invited), Koenig says that while trips to London,
Paris and Washington, D.C., are in demand, ``Our most popular tour
is a safari in Kenya.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Dave Wiggins, owner of Colorado-based American
Wilderness Experience, ``Kids want outdoor action and to have fun
with other kids. Parents want enrichment. Adventure travel answers
both. It's participatory. It's challenging. It's in a fun outdoor
setting. And more and more outfitters are adding family-focused
trips.''
</P>
<P>
   This growing diversity in family travel options poses new
challenges in arranging vacations, suggests Ogintz, who says,
``More people are planning on their own because most travel agents
don't fully understand the family market. In Paris, for instance,
there are few hotel rooms where you can fit more than two people,
so I want to know where I can go to rent a flat. Where can I find a
bistro that welcomes kids? A museum that has hands-on exhibits?''
</P>
<P>
   It would behoove travel agents _ and, yes, travel editors _ to
seek answers because family travel is clearly not a fad.

NOVELIST CONVICTS TEXAS PRISONS IN CELLBLOCK TALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN R. GODDARD  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Former Texas Monthly writer Robert Draper matches
a guilt-ridden ex-con against his opportunistic best friend, the
warden, in Draper's first novel, ``Hadrian's Walls'' (Alfred A.
Knopf, $23), a tangled multigenerational tale about an East Texas
prison town loosely based on Huntsville.
</P>
<P>
   Draper's Shepherdsville and its Hope Farm State Penitentiary
don't seem to have changed much since the 1930s, although the
state's prison building boom is pumping so much money into the
economy that every citizen is tainted by greed.
</P>
<P>
   The town is threatened by one entrepreneurial ex-con, Ricky
Tempesta, who plans to build a competing prison nearby. However,
the prison officials and their good old buddies in the state
legislature are painted as the true criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Hadrian Coleman, a convicted murderer at 15 and legendary
escapee at 30, is mainly concerned about getting the pardon
promised him by his boyhood friend, Sonny Hope, the smooth,
charming and corrupt prison warden. They also happen to love the
same woman, Jill Estelle, whose wealthy family fought the expansion
of the prison system _ and lost every round.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman tells his life story in the first person, peeling away
the small town's layers of hypocrisy like the skin of an onion _
ultimately revealing that he inadvertently killed a blind
pedophile, a federal judge, to save a teen-age Sonny from a fate
worse than death.
</P>
<P>
   Sonny's father, Purvis ``Thunderball'' Hope, the previous
warden, made sure Coleman did easy time for taking the rap for his
son. But Sonny eventually betrays his father, who cooked prisoners
alive in ``The Oven'' when they didn't behave. Add to this volatile
mix a crusading Houston Chronicle newspaper reporter, Sissy
Shipman, who loves exposing the sins of her hometown for the whole
state to read.
</P>
<P>
   Draper treads a fine line between Texas naturalism and Southern
gothic parody. His characters talk in an East Texas slang that
would probably make the dialogue coaches for ``Dallas'' wince.
There's not much poetry in the deep-fried cliches and scatological
metaphors that litter the book like so many cow patties. Draper may
have been aiming for Pat Conroy, but he comes a lot closer to a
Kmart Erskine Caldwell.
</P>
<P>
   It's tough writing about larger-than-life Texas characters
without making them sound like caricatures or cartoons. Draper's
overwrought, purple prose sometimes makes the story as hard to find
as a needle in the Big Thicket. The convoluted but predictable plot
is mostly revealed in flashbacks, which short-circuits the
suspense.
</P>
<P>
   The folks in Shepherdsville may not pick banjos, but they sound
a lot like the backwoods hillbillys in ``Deliverance.''

FROM NEW MEXICO, A CASE OF SISTERLY LOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIE COOPER  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Real people in familiar settings step off the pages of ``The
Wilder Sisters'' by Jo-Ann Mapson (HarperFlamingo, $24) and into
your heart.
</P>
<P>
   Two delightful, troubled, vibrant women _ Rose, 40, and Lily, 35
_ have taken different paths since growing up in Floralee, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   Rose married young, had two kids and stayed in Floralee. When
the story begins she is widowed, having lost her husband, Phillip,
in a car wreck caused by a drunken driver. Her 20-something
children, Amanda and Second Chance (named after his maternal
grandfather), are off living their own lives while Rose is
struggling as a bookkeeper for the town veterinarian, Austin
Donavan. She doesn't just work for Donavan; she carries a torch for
him.
</P>
<P>
   But Donavan's carrying his own torch for his ex-wife, Leah, and
the only way he knows to extinguish it is to drink. The lovable
town vet is also the lovable town drunk.
</P>
<P>
   Lily is flying high as a well-paid representative for a medical
instrument company in California. Then a woman dies on the
operating table because of a doctor's incompetence and Lily flees
to the safety of her family's horse ranch in Floralee, where she
hopes to regroup.
</P>
<P>
   While lots of families have skeletons, the Wilder family's
closet is full to bursting. Lily can't forget Tres Quintero, her
first love. Sometimes she thinks about their child she aborted.
Rose can't bring herself to admit that Phillip was not a faithful
or good husband.
</P>
<P>
   I can picture in my mind every one of Mapson's characters who
fill the town of Floralee _ the colorful Wilder parents, Poppy and
Chance; Paloma, who also works in the veterinarian's office; Shep,
the head wrangler at the Wilder ranch, El Rancho Costa Plente, who
is dying of cancer; even the crazy dogs, Chachi and Buddy Guy, that
the women love.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Shadow Ranch,'' one of Mapson's previous novels, ``The
Wilder Sisters'' puts a face on everyone who comes in contact with
the sisters.
</P>
<P>
   Mapson hits the nail on the head when it comes to sisters. Lily
reminisces about the fight that has kept the sisters from talking
to each other for years and the secrets that Lily has kept from
Rose.
</P>
<P>
   ``She missed her sister fiercely. There was no one else in the
world she could sit next to in the dark without saying a word and
know that she understood exactly what Lily was thinking. A person
could hate her sister forever and underneath the anger she'd still
take a bullet in her name.''
</P>
<P>
   Yep, that's a sister for you.
</P>
<P>
   There are some wonderful moments in the course of life in
northern New Mexico that flow from Mapson's pen. When the town
judge sentences Dr. Donavan to community service after a drunken
driving arrest, his punishment includes donating his services at
the New Mexico gay rodeo.
</P>
<P>
   There's the wonderful moment when the two sisters head to
Chimayo to say prayers for their loved ones, for those they've
loved and lost, and simply for love.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the food. The aromas and flavors of New Mexico
cooking are strong in ``The Wilder Sisters,'' and if your mouth
doesn't water, your eyes will.

FOR PANAMA CANAL EVENT, FEW EXPECT A BASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANAMA CITY _ When the United States takes the final step in
turning over control of the Panama Canal to this country in
December, the end of the 96-year relationship will come without
fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   Like Panama itself, wedged between the world's two largest
oceans, the plans for the transfer ceremony are being squeezed _
this time, by bigger end-of-year events: the millennium celebration
and the Y2K bug.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would anyone want to come to a canal transfer at the end
of this year?'' one US official said on condition of anonymity.
``Unfortunately, I think this has lost some of its glamour.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the VIP-speckled gala two years ago when the British
handed Hong Kong over to Chinese control in an event that was
televised live worldwide, American and Panamanian negotiators have
no such expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a large celebration on Dec. 31, the day the United
States must officially complete its withdrawal from the Canal Zone,
American and Panamanian negotiators are planning a ceremony
somewhere around Dec. 10. It is unclear how big the event will be
or who will attend.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers who originally wanted a New Year's Eve bash found
that many foreign dignitaries were unwilling to miss millennium
events in their home countries. Others expressed fears that Y2K
computer problems at airlines or airports might leave them stranded
in Panama on New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for the transfer ceremony have also been snagged in
domestic politics. Government officials had proposed that the
celebration happen Aug. 15, to commemorate the day the 50-mile-long
waterway was opened in 1914.
</P>
<P>
   Not coincidentally, that date would have allowed outgoing
President Ernesto Perez Balladares to take credit for resuming
sovereignty over the canal before he leaves office Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the newly elected president, Mireya Moscoso, will have
the honor of presiding over the event, and it remains to be seen
how the new government will want to mark the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   The seeming lack of enthusiasm surrounding the transfer may
reflect how much US attitudes have changed toward Panama and the
canal. Construction of the canal was once celebrated as a feat of
American know-how and muscle at the beginning of the so-called
American Century. Now, its surrender is seen by many as a symbol of
weakness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine that any potential presidential candidate
would want to be there and risk being associated with losing the
canal,'' said one Clinton administration official when asked
whether Vice President Al Gore might attend the handover.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that US ambivalence follows failed US-Panamanian
negotiations for a regional drug-fighting center and a small
continued American military presence, said Jennifer McCoy, director
of Latin American and Caribbean Programs at the Carter Center in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``The canal simply isn't as important as it once was as a means
of transportation and commerce,'' McCoy said. ``But this is still
an important event for showing how relations between the United
States and Latin America have matured.''
</P>
<P>
   The lack of organization for a December ceremony is in vivid
contrast to the quietly efficient US military retreat from Canal
Zone bases. Just five years ago, more than 10,000 troops and their
families lived here. Fewer than one third remain today.
</P>
<P>
   Handover ceremonies for emptied US facilities now happen
regularly. Balboa High and the Canal Zone Junior College, the last
of the US-run schools, graduated their final classes Saturday and
will be shut down.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's more important than the celebrations is that the people
of Panama are finally getting back the 10 percent of their land
that belongs to them,'' said Miguel Antonio Bernal, president of
the Political and International Studies Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Ownership of the canal must revert to Panama by noon on Dec. 31,
according to the terms of the treaty signed in 1977 between
President Jimmy Carter and General Omar Torrijos.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of scaled-down official ceremonies that day,
Panamanians plan parties on Dec. 31 regardless of who is there.
``The only ones who really need to be here are the people who are
taking it over, and that's us,'' Bernal said. ``If Clinton or some
other guests don't want to come, then they don't have to. We'll
celebrate anyway.''

NBC (YAWN) BANKS ON DRAMAS TO RECAPTURE VIEWERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Everything is supposed to look good on paper as
the television networks unveil their fall seasons. But NBC, which
kicked off the ``upfronts'' in New York on Monday, managed to look
desperate and dead wrong in a moment normally protected by big
dreams and unbridled optimism.
</P>
<P>
   The once-dominant Peacock is reeling after finding that much of
its development last season was pathetic _ losing viewers to CBS
and clinging to a fingernail-thin grasp of the coveted 18 to 49
demographic. It's in danger of losing the latter advantage and
falling further behind in the former unless it pulls some kind of
miracle out of a bushel of new offerings.
</P>
<P>
   NBC unveiled seven new shows for fall, and five of them are
dramas, a major reversal for a network built on sitcoms. This is
the first lineup that essentially will be the legacy of Scott
Sassa, NBC's West Coast president. The network hired Garth Ancier,
the former wunderkind programmer at The WB, but he came on too late
to make an impression for this season. If these dramas fail, he'll
hip up the network pretty quickly.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, NBC has to live with a rejiggered lineup that
has lost ``Homicide: Life on the Street,'' ``NewsRadio'' and
``Caroline in the City.''
</P>
<P>
   The network kept a couple of dogs in ``Veronica's Closet,''
which moves to a very weak Monday slot (following the equally bad
``Suddenly Susan'') and certainly will be exposed.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, ``Jesse,'' which has little merit, was renewed
and put back in the protected Thursday slot between ``Friends'' and
``Frasier,'' a move that bumps the superior ``Will &AMP; Grace'' back
to Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   NBC continued its ill-fated practice of giving sweetheart deals
to proven producers by allowing a sitcom called ``Stark Raving
Mad'' to get the plum Thursday slot between ``Frasier'' and
``Friends.'' The sitcom comes from Steven Levitan, who produces the
mediocre ``Just Shoot Me.''
</P>
<P>
   The new dramas are: ``Law &AMP; Order: Special Victims Unit,'' a
franchise spinoff that will run Mondays. What's a ``Special Victims
Unit,'' you ask? It's a task force to investigate cases deemed
``particularly heinous.''
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly a perfect fit after ``Veronica's Closet,'' and it's
likely to get drubbed by ``Ally McBeal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The West Wing'' is a drama set in the White House (from Adam
Sorkin of ``Sports Night'' and John Wells of ``ER'') that airs
Wednesdays. On paper it's ``Spin City'' buffed into a drama, with
Martin Sheen playing the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Third Watch,'' set for Sundays, is another effort from Wells
(whose ``Trinity'' failed miserably in the fall) and focuses on
firefighters, cops and paramedics. Apparently the three-pronged
approach is to guard against the fact that cop dramas are a dying
breed, and focusing on firefighters and paramedics working the 3
p.m. to midnight shift ought to spice things up. But it's been a
long time since ``Emergency'' was a hit, and The WB tried
paramedics and failed with ``Rescue 77.''
</P>
<P>
   Falling into the dramedy category will be ``Cold Feet,'' about
three young couples, set for Fridays. This is based on a British
series (no surprise _ its executive producer tried to get
``Cracker'' to fly here, too).
</P>
<P>
   ``Freaks and Geeks,'' also a dramedy, revolves around two
siblings going to high school in the 1980s. It airs Saturdays. On
paper, at least, it's going after the well-trod nostalgia route,
with an emphasis on not fitting in. But perhaps executive producer
Judd Apatow (``The Larry Sanders Show'') can breathe some creative
life into it.
</P>
<P>
   The comedies include ``The Mike O'Malley Show,'' about a
thirtysomething guy getting back together with an old girlfriend
(does that sound paper thin to you?). It gets a plum Tuesday slot.
The part to really worry about: He talks directly to the camera.
</P>
<P>
   And Levitan's ``Stark Raving Mad,'' starring Tony Shalhoub
(``Wings'') and Neil Patrick Harris (``Doogie Howser''), which,
even on paper, sounds disastrous. It's about a best-selling horror
writer (Shalhoub) and his ``obsessively meticulous'' editor
(Harris). Seems Doogie has to help his guy get over his writing
block by visiting him a lot in the schlockmeister's wacky
``netherworld'' apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we'll still get five nights of ``Dateline.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no other way to say it: NBC better hope it has a real
big surprise, a ``Providence,'' for example. Mondays are a crime
scene of ill-fitting shows doomed to get hammered by ``Monday Night
Football.'' Moving ``Will &AMP; Grace'' to Tuesdays makes viewers
choose between that and ``Sports Night'' _ again (unless ABC moves
the show). And Thursday remains vulnerable with ``Jesse'' and
``Stark Raving Mad.'' Rival networks have pledged to take over
Thursday for the first time in years, and if this is NBC's defense,
look out.
</P>
<P>
   The network also announced four midseason shows: A drama, ``The
Others,'' that seems to be in the mold of The WB's ``Charmed''; a
dramedy from Don Roos (``The Opposite of Sex'') called ``M.Y.O.B.''
NBC's foray into animation includes ``Sammy,'' a David Spade
vehicle, and ``God, the Devil and Bob,'' both of which feature
myriad name actors providing voices.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, NBC's schedule looks like a patchwork quilt that it
hopes won't pull to shreds before Ancier can work his magic next
season.

`JUST A MOVIE' OR INTERGALACTIC HYPE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Hype is an onion. Once the layers have been
peeled away, what's left is enough to make you cry.
</P>
<P>
   So it's for the thousands sleeping outside cineplex box offices,
blowing up Moviefone servers like they were SkyTel pagers, that I
weep. I weep for the cruel art of anticipation. I weep for the fact
that no matter what anyone says in advance of the public's seeing
George Lucas' ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace,'' people
will go because they have to _ some just won't brave the lines for
the first few weekends.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly two decades, people have been waiting for Lucas to
drop the first chapter of the New Testament in his intergalactic
space Bible. But ``The Phantom Menace'' seems to come from a motel
King James Version.
</P>
<P>
   We've been climbing over each other just to try to touch the hem
of this garment without asking what it's made of. But that's
because no one fretted until last week when Lucas and distributor
Twentieth Century Fox started showing the film, which explains why
some newspapers and magazines acted like that student in the front
of the classroom ``ooo-ooo''-ing with a raised arm ready to blow
his answer like a geyser.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, Lucas and company were right in their dismissal of
the excitement: ``The Phantom Menace'' is just a movie _ but one
whose salty aftertaste has nothing to do with the swollen,
salivating expectations ballooned around it. Even if it hadn't been
heralded as though it were the Second Coming, with Lucas positioned
as fans' personal Jesus, ``Episode One'' would still be a soulless,
infuriatingly uninvolving graphic novel.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas always imagined the ``Star Wars'' collection to be some
``Remembrance of Things Past`` or ``Fall of Western Civilization''
disguised as Saturday matinee serials _ epic, adventuresome with
myth and meaning neatly tucked between the majestic plot-summary
scroll-ups and clockwise fade-outs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the whole ``Star Wars'' franchise is both a victim of itself
and a curious, heartbreaking sign of the FX times. Industrial Light
&AMP; Magic and Skywalker Sound, Lucas' effects companies, have so
transfigured moviegoing into a digital, larger-than-life,
realer-than-real experience blurring the natural and the processed
that the humanity of the resulting product ceases to exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phantom Menace'' is distressingly dehumanized _ to the point
that it probably would be more fun to encounter it on a PlayStation
than at a multiplex. You want to interact with it, but access is
strictly forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tellingly sad, insipid state of affairs when halfway
through, the appearance of Samuel L. Jackson as a Jedi councilman
just sits up there. That's because he just sits there, like the
rest of the film. Besides Jackson's lukewarm stunt cameo, Lucas
tries a few other gambits to rack up street creds, littering his
special-effects carnival with Saturday morning artifacts from
cartoons and the serial matinees to the awful dubbing of Kung-Fu
bloodbaths.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a conspicuous lack of blood here _ and the sweat
and tears seem to have been spent in post-production. Lucas'
computer-generated world may hover closer to his vision, but the
voices given to some of these otherworldly creatures are naggingly,
disturbingly of this racialized one: bumbling federation
figureheads who have an ancient-Chinese-secret dialect, a wheedling
Middle-Eastern-sounding slave-owner, etc. (Yoda's Fortune Cookie
English is one thing . . .)
</P>
<P>
   Lucas' plot, which is bite-sized enough to fit in the ``long
time ago in a galaxy far, far away'' scroll-up, but stretches
itself for 130 minutes, introduces Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam
Neeson) and his protege, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor). They
rescue an embattled Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman), whose planet
is besieged by the Trade Federation, and befriend a digitalized
amphibious nuisance called Jar Jar Binks (a creature best thought
of as a screaming John Leguizamo drag queen as channeled by Chris
Tucker in a lizard suit _ Ahmed Best provides the voice and
physical inspiration).
</P>
<P>
   But most importantly, they discover Anakin Skywalker (Jake
Lloyd), the boy who would become Darth Vader. He's a slave along
with his mother Shmi (Bergman muse Pernilla August) on planet
Tatooine.
</P>
<P>
   It's a point of inherent fascination to see a portrait of the
monster as a young man, but all we're told about him is that his
mother has conceived him seemingly immaculately. It's the only
organic moment in this synthetic wonderland (designed by Gavin
Bocquet), and even that remains muddled in mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas would rather bask in a ``Ben-Hur'' cum ``Speed Racer'' at
Daytona moment in which Ani, as he's dollishly nicknamed, competes
in a pod race unwittingly for his freedom. It's simultaneously
exhilarating, silly and bland, if for no other reason than it feels
too easily won. Not the race, but the ovation.
</P>
<P>
   The event comes on like ``Hanna-Barbera's Digitalized Star Wars
Cantina Goes to the Colosseum,'' complete with Sesame Street
Sportscasters and Tuscan Sand People sniping. And Darth Maul (Ray
Park), the film's most haunting figure _ a horned, hell-faced ninja
vision of near-silent evil _ is relegated, along with his
double-edged light saber, to the film's action-packed margins. He
probably gets more screen time in the video game.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Phantom Menace'' plods from start to finish, the
lifelessness the actors bring to their diminished icons exacerbates
the suspicion that this entire endeavor is a collusive effort to
banish spontaneity and brush strokes from the film. McGregor's
Obi-Wan is a pallid ornament, while Portman speaks in an Anglo
monotone somewhere between Katharine Hepburn and post-Evita
Madonna. But beyond her Bob Mackie goth gowns, Alexander
McQueen-on-Skittles robes and the gall it took for the 17-year-old
to wear them, there's nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   Neeson spends the film looking vexed, like this Jedi business is
a strain on his acting _ but, hey, it's an emotion that survived an
environment hellbent on vacuuming the rest of them out.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison Ford and company were clunky but endearingly fearless
throughout the ``Star Wars Trilogy,'' and the go-for-broke
infectiousness was enthralling in itself. But 22 years later, an
artificial intelligence and calculated self-consciousness have
usurped the original's homemade joy and planted profundities.

RUNNING BEHIND, BUT RIGHT ON TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- These are not good days for the vice president of the
United States, not good days at all.
</P>
<P>
   Poll results wash over him with a relentless regularity, numbers
that show him getting trounced by George W. Bush, beaten soundly by
Elizabeth Dole, losing ground to his lone Democratic primary
challenger, Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign appears to be in a top-heavy state of disarray _
too many generals with too little talent trying to execute a plan
with too little passion. His style, his public persona, appears to
be growing duller by the day.
</P>
<P>
   And you've heard all the jokes by now, the litany of insults on
the late-night talk shows _ stiff as a board, more statue than man,
our vice president, Al Bore. Even his boss, the president,
expressed concern last week, publicly saying that his understudy
should ``go out and have a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   So there he was, Al Gore, sitting cross-legged in a wing chair
in the presidential suite of the Park Plaza Hotel late Monday
afternoon, attired in his trademark blue suit, jacket on, tie
knotted tight. If he was worried, he didn't say it. But if there
was reason to disbelieve the negative hype, he didn't easily
provide it.
</P>
<P>
   The private interview began with the easiest question of all:
What would he like to tell voters about himself that they may not
already know? Imagine how President Clinton would handle such
fluff, how he'd silently bite his lower lip, how he'd cock his head
and squint in that empathetic way he does, how he'd talk about all
those miles traveled to get where he is and the journey remaining
to get where he wants to go.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Gore. No metaphors there. He chose to recite
his resume, beginning with the fact that he's a Vietnam veteran, a
former newspaper reporter, a husband and father of four.
</P>
<P>
   ``I served in the House of Representatives for eight years and
served in the Senate for eight years and had town hall meetings all
over the state of Tennessee,'' he said. ``And my final reelection
was the first to carry all 95 counties in the state in modern
history.''
</P>
<P>
   It is stultifying, this response, notable only for what it
couldn't be. Eventually, he talked about living in a trailer with
his wife, Tipper, having the laundry blown off the line by nearby
helicopters. By then, the splash of color comes too late.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, you want to like Al Gore. Those who know him well
say he is terribly winning among friends, outright funny in both a
sophisticated and sophomoric way, even relaxed. On campaign trips,
he banters easily in off-the-record sessions with the gathered
reporters, often appearing in the press cabin in the back of Air
Force II with a beer in his hand and a smirk on his face. There is
no dark side, no violent temper, no sadistic or deviant streak. He
is indisputably smart.
</P>
<P>
   But the question remains, is it enough? And now members of his
own party murmur the once unthinkable question: Is it enough to win
the Democratic nomination? Those who venture to Washington to meet
him come away perplexed about his appeal.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, Clinton has become an albatross in a
nation distinctly tired of too many years of controversy. When
asked Monday if the president would play a significant role in his
campaign, Gore quickly replied ``No,'' then added, ``He has a
full-time job and is doing extremely well.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Gore was said to be livid when Clinton placed an
unusual call to a New York Times reporter last week to offer public
advice and support for his vice president. The ploy backfired,
solidifying images of Gore as Clinton's politically inept little
brother and resulting in a headline that read, ``Clinton admits to
concerns as Gore campaign stumbles.''
</P>
<P>
   So he carries onward, confident that as the public gets to know
him, they will get to like him. He may well be right. But it's not
as easy as it looks, shedding the indelible image of the second in
charge. As he tends to do these days, he referred often to his
wife. ``When you're that close with somebody, you just feel more
grounded when you're with them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, he suffers in comparison to the president, the
master politician. One example: Clinton interviews routinely
spilled long over the allotted time as he regaled reporters with
stories and left the impression he didn't want them to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's session with Gore ended precisely on schedule. On cue,
Gore stood and shook hands cordially goodbye. ``He likes to be on
time,'' an aide explained. It's his way. And right about now, maybe
that's just what the country wants and needs.

WHY YOUNGSTERS LOVE TO SAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Looking for a family vacation that's guaranteed to be enjoyed by
all ages? Then take a cruise.
</P>
<P>
   We introduced our children to cruising when the youngest was 4,
the oldest 8, and they took to cruising like fish take to water.
And that was in a day when cruise lines were not particularly
family friendly. The only cruise they weren't keen on was one
aboard the original Love Boat, the Pacific Princess. The reason was
simple: They had reached their teens and there were no other kids
aboard. Fortunately, they were a foursome and provided their own
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise ships have come a long way since those long-ago days 20
years ago. Now, most cruise lines have dedicated children's
programs and facilities. And families are flocking to the ships.
Carnival reports it expects to have some 200,000 children on its
ships this year. Disney will be bringing on its Disney Wonder,
sister ship to the Magic, which sails on three- and four-day
cruises from Florida to Disney's own island.
</P>
<P>
   For families, a cruise means no worries about food likes or
dislikes: There's always something the kids will eat. Sometimes a
cruise is a great introduction to new tastes _ one son discovered
frogs legs and escargot. The kids also make new discoveries by
seeing other cultures, meeting other youngsters from around the
country and the world.
</P>
<P>
   Parents find time for themselves. What could be better? Maybe
booking a ship with a family suite with separate rooms for parents
and kids.
</P>
<P>
   Family cruising has never been better. No matter what their age,
the kids will find lavish facilities, from computer labs for even
the young set to special ``no adults allowed'' clubs for the teens.
</P>
<P>
   The cruise lines with great programs for children include
American Hawaii Cruises, Carnival, Celebrity, Costa, Disney,
Holland America, Norwegian, Premier, Princess, Royal Caribbean, and
Windjammer.
</P>
<P>
   Ask for brochures from the lines showing family cruising
facilities, and before booking, ask about how the programs work,
and when they work. On one cruise line, parents seeking a day on
shore discovered that the children's program did not begin until an
hour after they had to join their tour. That's no fun.
</P>
<P>
   Check on the onboard facilities for both children and adults,
staffing for the children's programs, hours for the programs, and
even medical facilities on board.
</P>
<P>
   Ask also about staterooms for families: While most just pack the
whole family into one room, some offer suites, others connecting
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   If you're not sure about a seven-day cruise, consider a shorter
one. Disney, Carnival, and Premier all offer shorter cruises and
combine them with a land stay. Disney's cruises are three or four
days long, and the first three or four days of the vacation are at
Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Volendam delay
</P>
<P>
   Holland America's new Volendam, which was set to do a series of
New England cruises this fall, has run into a completion delay at
the shipyard in Italy. However, because of the delay, Holland
America is moving its Maasdam out of Europe, where it is doing
summer cruises earlier than expected to fill in for the Volendam.
The Maasdam will also do an unexpeced trans-Atlantic crossing
cruise, London to Boston, on Aug. 29. The Maasdam will then do a
seven-day Boston to Montreal cruise sailing Sept. 5, then assume
the Volendam's original schedule. The change also means the first
two planned Volendam sailings have been canceled, and scheduled
passengers will be offered alternatives and compensation.
</P>
<P>
   The change also means that passengers scheduled to sail on the
Maasdam in Europe in the fall are being moved to the Rotterdam.
</P>
<P>
   The Volendam's delay could also reflect reports of a softening
of the European cruise market because of American travelers'
concerns about the war in Yugoslavia. Travelers considering a
European cruise should understand that the cruise lines sailing in
the Mediterranean are safely away from the war zones, so there
should be no concern about being in harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   And for those who might be considering a European cruise, this
could be a good time because many lines may be offering discounts
to fill the cancelations.
</P>
<P>
   Also because of the Volendam delay, Holland America's next ship,
the Zaandam, will also be delayed. Its scheduled maiden sailing is
now set for March 26, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Theater cruise
</P>
<P>
   Theater lovers should applaud this year's Theatre at Sea cruise
aboard the Royal Viking Sun. Stage and screen stars will headline
the Theater Guild's 80th Birthday Celebration Sept. 10-24 on a
London to Mediterranean cruise. Among stars on board will be
Patricia Neal, Cliff Robertson, Jean Stapleton, Alan Arkin, and Zoe
Caldwell. Cruise prices begin at $2,893, air fare is extra, and
former Cunard passengers receive a 14 percent discount. For
information, call 800-752-9732.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Whales in Norway
</P>
<P>
   Whale watching safaris to see the sperm whale, the world's
largest toothed whale, are being added to selected cruises of the
Norwegian Coastal Voyage. The voyage takes in some spectacular

KRUGMAN CHIVVIES, JAPAN SQUIRMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Asian finance ministers met over the weekend in Langkawi,
Maylaysia and, from a distance, the forum on Asian Pacific
Economic &UR;  &LR; Cooperation at the island resort looked like the good old
days.
</P>
<P>
   No one disputed the International Monetary Fund conclusion
earlier this month that, twenty months after the maelstrom began
with a currency devaluation in Thailand, more stable conditions had
returned to global financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   There was little of the rancor over hedge fund regulation and
short-term capital controls that had marred similar meetings of
Asian nations during the period of the full-blown crisis.
</P>
<P>
   And at the conclusion of the conference, Japanese Finance
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa announced a $16-billion facility to
provide credit guarantees for longer-term debt issued by nations
affected by the crunch, including Indonesia, Korea, Maylaysia, the
Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   But in Japan, short-term interest rates are still fluttering
near zero and skeptics doubt whether Miyazawa can deliver on his
government's promise to achieve 1/2 percent of GNP growth this year
_ instead of another decline. The world's second largest economy
remains mired in a stagnation that has lasted most of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has been tougher on Japan than Paul Krugman of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A currency expert with a
strong interest in how macroeconomic policy affects trade and vice
versa, Krugman was perhaps the first analyst to describe Japan as
being caught in a ``liquidity'' trap similar to the bind that
afflicted the industrial economies during the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   As the generation of the Japanese baby boom has reached
retirement, the supply of private savings simply has outstripped
the demand for investment at home and abroad, according to Krugman.
</P>
<P>
   With the private sector unwilling to spend, the public sector
can't spend enough to restart the engine _ not without blowing the
top off an already large deficit. (It has been trying without
noticeable success.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The story of Japanese macroeconomics in the 1990s is that of
the pump that refused to be primed,'' he says, ``of ever-growing
budget deficits that stave off collapse but do not generate
self-sustaining growth.''
</P>
<P>
   In a new book that surveys in some detail the recent Asian
crisis, ``The Return of Depression Economics,'' Krugman argues at
some length that the only measure that can get the Japanese economy
growing again is to deliberately inflate its currency a little bit
_ say 2 percent or so a year.
</P>
<P>
   Only if Japan's depositers know that their nest eggs are bound
to shrink will they go searching for some way to preserve
purchasing power by taking on a little much-needed risk, Krugman
argues.
</P>
<P>
   Fiscal policy _ tax cuts and public works _ has reached its
limits; only announcing explicit inflation targets or, perhaps,
``quantitative easing'' (a polite phrase meaning ``printing
money'') will do the trick.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the Japanese government don't like Krugman's ideas.
Neither do most Western conservatives. To them, the reflation plan
calls for taking an easy and dangerous way out.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation has been notoriously difficult to manage at a steady
rate, they say; usually fairly quickly it has gotten out of hand.
What Japan really needs is deregulation, restructuring, and a wave
of plant closings.
</P>
<P>
   Even without such supply-side reforms, they say, the Japanese
economy is finally poised for a strong recovery. Another few weeks
should be decisive . . .. And another.
</P>
<P>
   Krugman recently returned from Japan, more discouraged than
ever, he says. ``If you tell them . . . that there should be a
clear committment to increase the monetary base at an annual rate
of at least 15 percent, you get the feeling that you have proposed
an immoral act.''
</P>
<P>
   In an article the other day in the Financial Times, he argued
that while key policymakers ``now understand the nature of their
problems, they still lack the intellectual courage to act on that
understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What this means, I fear, is that things will have to get
considerably worse before they get better. The good news is that
this can probably be arranged, and sooner than you think.''

<P>
   When I was in my 20s and inhabiting rooming houses, I was given
a book called ``Cooking in a Bedsitter,'' by the formidable
Katharine Whitehorn. It pointed out that although I was living in
squalor, I didn't have to live in total squalor. With a hot plate,
some herbs and a little foresight, a degree of elegance might be
achieved.
</P>
<P>
   I have been a grateful reader of such advice books and their
variants, women's magazine articles, ever since. (Grateful, though
sometimes bemused: Do I really want to marbleize an end table or
make a gingerbread chalet? Not today.)
</P>
<P>
   There's no shortage of such advice; nor is there any shortage of
women dishing it out. Where did they come from, all these kindly,
bossy, ersatz aunts, whether real or invented _ Fannie Farmer,
Betty Crocker, Martha Stewart and the rest?
</P>
<P>
   I'd say they trace their lineage to Mrs. Isabella Beeton.
</P>
<P>
   For most of our millennium, the few advice books for women were
likely to be religious or moral. Often the only women who could
read were nuns or noblewomen, and housework and cooking were done
by servants. If you were of the higher orders you supervised them,
a skill in itself; if not, you learned the basics from your mother
or from other servants.
</P>
<P>
   Advice books didn't arrive until the rise of a literate middle
class. The ``new money'' created in the 19th century by the
Industrial Revolution often meant young brides who were not only
unprepared to run large establishments but who were also unversed
in the manners required in the polite society to which they'd been
elevated.
</P>
<P>
   Along came the professional advisers, often calling themselves
``A Lady,'' offering bits and pieces of what you might require: a
cookbook here, an etiquette primer there.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Beeton was thus by no means the first of her kind. But
``Beeton's Book of Household Management'' was the first to use
tested recipes, with costs and sample menus. It was also the first
comprehensive book on running a household, telling readers what to
pay their servants and how to remove spots from lace. In addition,
the book had many helpful illustrations. (What does a stair brush
look like? How do you tell one breed of pig from another?)
</P>
<P>
   From her name, which suggests a round, industrious busybody,
you'd expect Mrs. Beeton to have been at least 40. Not a bit of it.
She was born in 1836, and through the death of her father and the
remarriage of her mother, she became the oldest girl in a family of
21 children, which gave her ample experience coping with domestic
chaos.
</P>
<P>
   She was only 23 when she began her magnum opus, in successive
numbers of The Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine, published by her
husband's company; it appeared in book form in 1861. She was
compiling a cooking dictionary and writing a book on needlework
when she died of childbed fever after the birth of her fourth
child. She was 29.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Beeton is direct in her style and equally clear about her
aims. ``What moved me ... to attempt a work like this,'' she says
in her introduction, ``was the discomfort and suffering I had seen
brought upon men and women by household management. I have always
thought that there is no more fruitful source of family discontent
than a housewife's badly cooked dinners and untidy ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless you keep ``a comfortable home,'' she warns, the husbands
will flee to their ``clubs, well-ordered taverns and dining
houses''; it is with these that a wife must compete.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for her success was her acknowledgment of human
frailty. She knew that servants' references were likely to skimp on
truth, so she told employers to visit the reference giver: If her
own house is a wreck, don't hire the servant.
</P>
<P>
   She knew you could get caught short, so she explained not only
how to make butter but also how to make butter in a hurry. (Put the
cream in a bottle and shake it.)
</P>
<P>
   She advised the young wife about almost everything _ the
importance of keeping accounts, the best conversational topics
(entertaining histories), what to wear (green goes well with
violet) and how to spend evenings at home (the ladies do
needlework; the man reads aloud from some ``good standard work or
amusing publication'').
</P>
<P>
   And that's just in the first 17 pages. Her book is more than
1,000 pages long.
</P>
<P>
   Is there anything Mrs. Beeton left out that she might cover now?
Germs; they hadn't really hit the scene. And sex, of course, which
was unprintable.
</P>
<P>
   About ``female emancipation'' she was dubious, but far from
being a delicate Angel in the House, a Beeton woman was the
Generalissimo in the House, commanding an army of servants, men
included. Her work was emphatically work, and required
intelligence, tact, character, energy and dignity.
</P>
<P>
   Much of her advice is dated now, but her insight and common
sense endure. For Mrs. Beeton life is an art, and its aim is
enjoyment, one's own included. The woman practicing this art must
be a stage manager, but she is also the lead actress, saying her
lines effortlessly.
</P>
<P>
   And the details of this art, which some _ men, for instance _
might consider frivolous, are actually of deep importance, because
on them depends the happiness of all.

SPRINGTIME WALKS CAN ERASE WINTER WEIGHT GAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Many Americans face a weighty surprise this time
of year, when the scale tips more heavily after a long winter of
snacking, sleeping and trying to stay warm.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, you're not wearing big bulky clothes
anymore,'' said Joyce Bagyi, a clinical dietitian at Albany Medical
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Her advice for winter weight gainers: ``Nip it in the bud.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning the spring shake-up into a shape-up doesn't have to be
difficult. Bagyi doesn't even use the D-word.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have chips with your sandwich? Switch from chips to
fruit,'' she said. ``If you use two tablespoons of cream cheese on
your bagel, cut down to one.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, Bagyi encourages healthy people to step out
of hibernation and back into their original size by walking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take a 10-minute walk at lunch, take another 10-minute walk
when you get home. ``It doesn't have to be all or nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Bach of St. Paul, Minn., agrees. As the co-author of
``ShapeWalking: Six Easy Steps to a Healthier Life,'' Bach is a
nationally known fitness specialist for those of us who don't have
unlimited time and money to spend on shaping up.
</P>
<P>
   Her goal is to get more people to realize the benefits of
walking as a way to lose weight and improve cardiovascular health.
``You don't need to go to a gym,'' she said. ``You can get into
shape by walking.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent study published in the Journal of the American Medical
Association also made that point.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers found that sedentary adults who took up walking did
as well or better over a two-year period at cutting fat, lowering
cholesterol and improving aerobic fitness as those who took up
traditional exercise programs.
</P>
<P>
   One reason: Study participants who went to the gym eventually
lost interest. The walkers, on the other hand, kept walking. ``It's
the easiest to fit into your life,'' Bach said.
</P>
<P>
   Ed and Emily Koch of Niskayuna, N.Y., have made walking up to
six miles a day as routine as brushing their teeth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walking is so much fun,'' Emily Koch said. ``It's much easier
than being on a diet.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides walking to stay in shape, the Koches, both 68, use it to
burn stress and socialize. They're members of the Empire State
Capital Volkssporters of Albany, a walking group.
</P>
<P>
   Walking with a partner or friends can be a good way to stay
motivated. In her book, Bach encourages people to schedule their
walks into their day, just like any other important commitment.
</P>
<P>
   While even a slow walk will help you lose weight (the average
person burns about 100 calories per mile), she challenges people to
walk in their target zone.
</P>
<P>
   That zone is reached when your perceived exertion is between 5
and 7 on a scale of 1 to 10, with one being the easiest, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A five would be the same feeling you get when you're walking
deliberately, as if you're on your way to an appointment,'' she
said. ``A six would be as if you're five minutes late for that
appointment. At seven, you're 10 minutes late.''
</P>
<P>
   By working toward doing your entire walk in the target zone, not
including your warm-up or cool down, Bach estimates you can lose 10
pounds a year.

   A month shy of giving birth to her first child, Laura Pouzer, a
college chemistry teacher, reclines on a padded table at Johns
Hopkins University, the luxuriousness of her belly and her wit on
equal display as she takes the infamous Stroop stress test.
</P>
<P>
   Lists of words flash on a screen, each of them specifying a
color _ blue, yellow, white, purple _ but each printed in a color
other than the color it signifies. It is Pouzer's assignment to
call out, as quickly as possible, the colors the words appear in,
rather than the color they specify.
</P>
<P>
   I look at the slides over her shoulder and feel my brain lurch
and creak. I see the word ``blue,'' I think the word ``blue,'' the
tint it's written in be damned.
</P>
<P>
   Pouzer, though, is acing the Stroop, flying through the lists
without missing a beat or flubbing a shade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perfect, perfect,'' says Kathleen Costigan, a researcher and
obstetrical nurse. ``You're awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   As Pouzer barrels along, transponders taped to her belly reveal
two things: first, that she is enviably relaxed, her heart rate
slow and skin-conductance response flat; and second, that the
36-week-old male fetus within her is sleeping soundly. It is as
though the purity of the mother's mental concentration has lulled
the baby into long-wave bliss.
</P>
<P>
   The test over, the 28-year-old Pouzer nudges her eyeglasses up
her nose and shrugs. ``That wasn't too bad,'' she says to Costigan
and Janet DiPietro, a developmental psychologist. ``Much easier
than the last time.''
</P>
<P>
   A moment later, thump, jab, squirm. Her fetus is awake.
Something about his mother has changed, and he is practically
knocking on the door of her uterine chamber to find out what it is.
</P>
<P>
   Half a world away, in the laboratory of Yosinori Kuwabara and
his colleagues at Juntendou University in Tokyo, a fetal goat
floats in a clear acrylic tank the size of a large toaster oven,
bathed in eight quarts of artificial amniotic fluid kept at body
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Its umbilical cord is threaded to two machines that jointly
perform the nuts and bolts of a placenta, pumping in blood, oxygen
and nutrients and cleaning out waste. The fetus is almost 20 weeks
old, weighs about six pounds and has been living in its eerie
fishbowl of a universe since it was removed from its mother by
Caesarean section several days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The creature behaves like any other prenatal goat, blinking its
soft black eyes and kicking its slender white limbs. Should it
survive for two more weeks, to the full 21-week goat term, it will
be ``born'': lifted out of the tank and its umbilicus cut.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwabara and his co-workers are striving to create a viable
artificial womb, a system to sustain a developing infant when the
real womb won't or can't do. So far, the researchers have managed
to keep their goats-on-a-rope alive for up to 10 days, and they are
getting closer to understanding why the artificial environment
eventually fails its charges.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists hesitate when asked when their experimental
uterus will be ready for human use, but others happily speculate
for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of difficult technical problems to be
overcome,'' says Malcolm Levene, professor of pediatrics and child
health at the University of Leeds in England. ``But I see them as
being soluble in the next 5 to 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   In vivo, in vitro, the womb in two views: one, the mother's
belly, the sum of humanity's yesterdays, the umbilicus the original
apron string that yokes us all to the body's throbbing loneliness
and joy; and the other, the acrylic baby bumper, an embryonic
technology that has the seductive flash of the eternal tomorrow, of
the airplane foil, the computer screen, the crystal ball.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as polarized as the two vignettes of the uterus initially
appear, they are both, in the end, about the future. Tales of
reproduction and birth have always been about the future, about
extending the shelf life of your longings and fantasies beyond your
personal expiration date.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe my child will revolutionize art; maybe my child will help
colonize Mars. People have always dreamed of consorting with gods
and bearing immortal progeny, or suckling at the breast of the
Virgin Mary to attain eternal salvation.
</P>
<P>
   Being the natural currency of tomorrow, the topic of human
fertility lends itself to the wildest sci-fi spasms and millennial
speculations. And as though to oblige our fixation on big round
numbers, our high priests and priestesses of fecundity, our
reproductive endocrinologists, embryologists, gynecologists and
geneticists, lately have pipetted up an unceasing supply of
millennialist material.
</P>
<P>
   Postmenopausal women have gestated their daughters' eggs and
given birth to their own grandchildren. Congenitally infertile men
can have their dysfunctional sperm mechanically rammed into the
body of an egg, and thus sire sons who inherit the once
uninheritable: the fathers' sterility. An older woman's fading egg,
and the chromosomes it enfolds, can be rejuvenated through the
addition of the rich, viscous cytoplasm from a younger woman's egg.
</P>
<P>
   If that chimeric gamete is then fertilized and transferred into
the womb of a third woman for gestation, the resulting child can
claim three biological mothers: chromosomal mom, cytoplasmic mom
and gestational mom.
</P>
<P>
   Once a little couplet said it all: mother's baby, father's
maybe. Now DNA tests can pretty well settle the question of
biological paternity, while the issue of biological maternity has
been sufficiently muddied to demand the regular intercession of
judges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're being forced to rethink the whole concept of
motherhood,'' says George J. Annas, chairman of the department of
health law at the Boston University School of Public Health. ``I
never thought that would happen in my lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   These goggle-eyed tomorrow scenes are already today's tomorrows,
if not yesterday's. There are more to come, of course, many more.
Most of them can't be predicted or described in any detail, but
each will surely force us to think better and harder than we're
used to about two mighty piers of life's foundation: power and
love.
</P>
<P>
   How much power can we have over the timing and circumstances of
our reproduction? And does that power give us greater freedom, or
does it deprive us of one of life's most unsung freedoms: the
freedom to have things happen on their own?
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people don't choose to have children, they just get
pregnant,'' says R. Alta Charo, professor of law and medical ethics
at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. ``Reproductive
technologies cumulatively reduce the range of events that happen by
serendipity and increase the range of events that happen by active
planning. This changes the texture of life. One of the rights we
have is the right to not have to make choices.''
</P>
<P>
   The new fertility fetishes also bring us face to face with our
concept of love, and what it means to love our children, and what
inspires that love or sullies it. Can we love a child who is
genetically unrelated to us? Of course; every parent of an adopted
child knows as much.
</P>
<P>
   Yet infertile couples go to extraordinary lengths to give birth
to a genetically related baby, and their hunger to see their
chromosomes represented in the next generation has inspired many of
the new reproductive manipulations. But does the quest to have
genetically related offspring mean that we are delighted with
ourselves, our spouses, our extant genomic kin?
</P>
<P>
   ``When I talk to people who say how important it is that their
children be theirs, and who think of adoption as a terrible last
resort, I say to them, `Oh, you must be so close to your parents
and your siblings,''' says Barbara Katz Rothman, a sociologist at
the City University of New York. ``They say, `No, I haven't seen my
brother in three years _ he's a real jerk.' So I reply, `What makes
you think it will be different for you and your genetically related
children?'''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the emerging technologies exemplify the profound tension
and interdependency between power and love, between our hopes and
nattering fears for tomorrow, as medicine does what we demand that
it do, and plays the stork through any kind of outrageous weather.
</P>
<P>
   The artificial uterus is one technology: In this we see the
ultimate attempt to control gestation, which means to control
ourselves, the personal plant. The other is genetic enhancement,
the attempt to improve or select some of an embryo's traits _ that
is, to control our children.
</P>
<P>
   They are both coming, if not in 10 years, then in 15 or 50. If
we can tinker, we will tinker, and when it comes to our kids, we'll
hammer ourselves deaf, bent and bruised, until we hammer ourselves
away for good.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, the feminist Shulamith Firestone wrote in
``The Dialectics of Sex'' about the need for an artificial uterus,
a way to remove the act of reproduction from the female body and
thus free women from what she saw as the source of their biological
servitude.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwabara and his colleagues are not working on the artificial
uterus as a nod to female liberation, of course. They're doing it
with the hope of helping extremely premature infants, those born
before 22 or 23 weeks of gestation, the current outer limit of
salvageability, when the fetus is meant to be an aquatic animal,
suspended in solution, its fragile gelatinous flesh shielded from
the brutality of air or touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Artificial wombs will begin as a response to the needs of
women who are unable to carry a baby through to term,'' says
Marshall Marinker, a visiting professor of general practice at the
University of London. ``But like so many things in medicine, what
begins as a response to illness may become a lifestyle choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Look at Viagra, he says. It began as a drug for clinical
impotence and now is seen as a recreational means to megapotence.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, horrors, the mother who would choose to turn her fetus over
to a burbling laboratory broth!
</P>
<P>
   Mary B. Mahowald, a professor at the MacLean Center for Clinical
Medical Ethics at the University of Chicago, believes that the
demand for an artificial uterus will be negligible and that most
women view pregnancy as a whole-body thrill, one of life's few
genuine odysseys.
</P>
<P>
   She published a study in 1997 in the Journal of Women's Health
in which she asked women the following question: If you could
either gestate a baby using a donor egg or have your own egg
gestated by a surrogate mother, but couldn't do both, which would
you choose? A slight majority opted for gestation with donor egg.
``Many women feel that there's a relationship you can develop with
the fetus during pregnancy that men are not privy to,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. But when I posed Mahowald's question to a dozen friends
and colleagues, some of them mothers, some of them not, a slight
majority opted for having their personal eggs baked in a surrogate
womb. ``The idea of being pregnant seems noxious to me,'' explained
one woman, a childless professor at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
</P>
<P>
   When I further told my respondents to imagine that they had had
a hysterectomy but wanted a child and asked if they would prefer to
have their eggs gestated by a surrogate human mother or in an
artificial womb, a sizable majority opted for the artificial womb.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously the thought of a fake Frankenstein-ian uterus was not
as disturbing to them as the prospect of dealing with a genuine
surrogate mother, who might get drunk or smoke while pregnant or
demand visitation rights after birth.
</P>
<P>
   If we cannot blithely assume that every woman who wants to have
children wants to be pregnant _ if some women, like many men, find
the prospect noxious _ then we are left to wonder just how bad it
might be for a fetus to spend much of its tenure in a box.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the artificial uterus may be reasonably proficient at
performing the basics of nutrient delivery and the exchange of
blood gases. But what of the rest, the spectacular rest that is the
maternal-fetal dyad, an exquisite push-me-pull-you relationship
millions of years in the forging?
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to DiPietro's country, the land of blinkered darkness.
DiPietro is one of the only scientists in the world who are
studying the relationship between maternal and fetal behavior.
Doctors have spent a lot of time tracking how the fetus grows and
when its various organs and sensory capabilities mature: the fetus
as an independent operator, the free-floating homunculus at the end
of ``2001: A Space Odyssey.''
</P>
<P>
   DiPietro herself was performing such an orthodox study about 10
years ago. She was electronically monitoring the progress of a
fetus that happened to be gestating in the belly of a nurse who
worked in a neonatal intensive-care unit.
</P>
<P>
   Just to be conversational, DiPietro asked the woman if it
bothered her to be around desperately sick newborns while she
herself was pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `Not really, except once,''' DiPietro recalls.
``That was when her office was used as a temporary morgue for the
newborns that had died.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, DiPietro's monitors detected a big surge in heart
rate. ``At first, I thought it was the nurse's heart rate going up
at the memory,'' she says. ``But then I realized it was the fetus's
heart. It was racing. It was an instantaneous reaction.'' The nurse
remembered that she had felt a suffocating grief, and her fetus
fairly keened in reply.
</P>
<P>
   In short order, DiPietro changed her focus from tracking
prenatal development to the study of the behavioral interplay
between mother and fetus. She wanted to know whether a woman's mood
or temperament or stress level had any impact on her fetus. If so,
how, why, when, to what end? If not, why not?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous _ the questions just haven't been asked,'' she
says. ``Women have their ideas. Anecdotes abound. There are
references in the Bible and in Shakespeare about how a mother's
emotions affect the fetus. But our scientific knowledge is utterly
crude.
</P>
<P>
   ``A mother's emotions have to affect an infant's temperament,
they have to,'' she says, at once earnest and matter-of-fact. ``A
fetus is bathed in maternal hormones, chemicals, peptides, at just
the time when its brain is forming.''
</P>
<P>
   But personal conviction is one thing; proof is another. And so
DiPietro studies pregnant women and their fetuses and puts women
like Pouzer through stressful quizzes to see how they and their
babies react and interact.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're learning, what is a new scientific finding, is
that, yes, the fetus does respond to its mother's emotions,'' she
says. ``Sometimes the reaction of the fetus, in terms of heart rate
and movement, is even more pronounced than the reaction of the
mother. That reactivity is not necessarily a bad thing. The arousal
must be doing something to its nervous system, perhaps helping to
drive brain development, but we don't know that yet for sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mother provides such a complex, labile environment for the
fetus. She gets up, she sits down, she shifts position. She eats
something different, it affects the amniotic fluid. When she
laughs, she shakes the baby around really vigorously.'' DiPietro
waves her arms in the air to demonstrate. ``Who knows? That could
be why we like roller-coaster rides _ and why they make us laugh
even while we're screaming.''

<P>
   Not long ago, Ann Winblad, a successful venture capitalist well
known on the high-tech circuit, stood up to speak at a conference.
She tapped the microphone and inquired sweetly, ``Does this pick up
women's voices?''
</P>
<P>
   If Winblad, with a sterling track record and millions yet to
invest, can ask that, consider what it's like for most women.
</P>
<P>
   We now get the mike at conferences in part because organizers
are consciously trying to balance things, and in part because many
of us simply deserve it _ but over all, women still have trouble
being heard.
</P>
<P>
   Can cyberspace change that? Or will it, like so many other tools
and technologies, simply become a way for the old order to
reinforce itself?
</P>
<P>
   Powerful tools in powerful hands tend to increase the
concentration of power, but the Internet isn't just a tool. It's a
medium that may change the balance of power.
</P>
<P>
   Consider some history. Long ago, women's work was defined by
women's bodies. They bore children and were generally weaker.
Gradually, as work became less physical and personal service became
a commodity rather than something one did at home, women joined the
work force as nurses, servants and governesses.
</P>
<P>
   As the world industrialized and dexterity began to matter more
than strength, they became machine operators. In many semiconductor
plants, especially overseas in countries where discrimination is
legal, women are still preferred today for their smaller fingers
and the precision with which they can work. And as work began to
include information, many women became telephone operators,
typists, clerks and secretaries.
</P>
<P>
   Then economic pressures started changing society and social
changes began affecting work patterns. As our economy has grown and
become ever more competitive, the stock market and other pressures
are focusing on performance rather than status, and capable women
have begun to get the work they deserve.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, people are promoted more for performance;
businesses can't afford to do otherwise in a competitive market.
Women can get good jobs based on performance _ at least up to the
highest reaches of many companies.
</P>
<P>
   I wish that were reliably true. Twenty years ago, we thought
that the high-tech world would by now be different, that women
would succeed in large numbers because this was a world where
performance counted. It hasn't turned out that way.
</P>
<P>
   Women still have a tough time making it into management. We're
still socialized to look to men for leadership. Power is based not
on performance alone but on presence and personality _ and
perceptions of personality. In business, women still face a
different world from men.
</P>
<P>
   I recall the first board meeting of the Electronic Frontier
Foundation I ever attended, way back in 1990 or 1991. I had been
invited to join the board by Mitch Kapor, the entrepreneur and
developer of Lotus 1-2-3, and an enlightened person if ever there
was one. I knew the other board members, who all respected me. But
I couldn't get a word in edgewise. Why? I couldn't imagine any
reason other than that I spoke with a female voice. It was a shock.
</P>
<P>
   These were no traditional troglodytes in suits; they were my
kind of people, striving to build a new world on the Net. (At the
next meeting we had a female facilitator, and it went a lot
better.)
</P>
<P>
   It's a common experience for other women and girls, from
second-grade classrooms to boardrooms. And the high-tech industry
is really no better than most. I've been to meetings where a woman
ventures a comment and is ignored. Minutes later a man makes the
same point and is noticed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, as high-tech products are being integrated into
day-to-day business, people are using the Internet not just to
order products and retrieve information but also to communicate.
They use it to discuss issues, manage teams, negotiate contracts.
There's enough Net time for people _ women, that is _ to establish
themselves without a physical presence.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it's the users of the Internet, rather than the
sellers of the Internet, that are changing fastest. As a
communications medium where personal presence is primarily text and
sex differences are not immediately visible, the Internet is
tailor-made to help women finally find their voices.
</P>
<P>
   And if women feel (rightly or wrongly) stifled in corporate
environments, they can more easily strike out for themselves. The
information, access and productivity once available only to big
businesses are now accessible to individual entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, as the interim chairman of the Internet Corporation
for Assigned Names and Numbers (Icann), I have become part of a
world full of discussions over so-called mailing lists, where
people E-mail their ideas to large groups for comment. It's not a
gender-free or character-free world. But gender is less noticeable
in our interactions on line. What are noticeable are the words on
the screen: Does this person make sense?
</P>
<P>
   When I first started, the names meant nothing; now I have some
notion of what to expect from each: insight, whining, skepticism.
Yes, people have on-line personalities, but their sex does not
generally color how people read their thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   On these networks, women write in the same variety of ways as
men. But you can say your piece and post it without being
interrupted midway. The Net enforces a certain fairness by putting
everything up on the screen without fear or favor.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there are filtering tools, and there are certain people
many people filter out. But that usually has to do with content,
not gender.
</P>
<P>
   On line, I'm sure some people may filter me out, but it doesn't
happen the way it does off line _ unconsciously. Yes, people may
discount what women write, but they are more likely to read it. My
on-line voice does not have a high pitch of the kind that many men
find hard, for whatever reason, to hear.
</P>
<P>
   Another common experience of women _ having your good idea
picked up later and attributed to someone else _ is less likely to
happen on the Web. There's a record, and there are subtle ways of
pointing back to it if you are missed.
</P>
<P>
   Net-based discussion is likely to become increasingly important
in the way teams of people communicate, in politics, business or
other endeavors. It is important for women to join this on-line
world. But leadership goes beyond discussion to carrying things
forward.
</P>
<P>
   It requires making decisions that can't be made by consensus;
it's about absorbing the uncertainty everyone feels by making a
decision and taking responsibility for it.
</P>
<P>
   That's still not something most women are trained to do. But I'm
hopeful that on-line experience will help. The Net won't change
everything, but it's one more tool to overcome the destiny of
biology. The explicit rule is that we're equal, and new habits may
make it so. The ability to earn money at work has made a huge
difference in the balance of power at home.
</P>
<P>
   May the ability to be heard at work now make a huge difference
in the balance of power out in the world.

LIKE NOW, TECHNOLOGY SPURRED ECONOMY IN 19TH CENTURY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What explains the durability of the bull market in stocks?
</P>
<P>
   The simple answer is that the American economy has been able to
grow steadily without generating inflation _ at least until last
Friday, when a higher-than-expected report on consumer prices
spooked the market. Skeptical that growth and low inflation could
coexist for an extended period of time, Maureen Allyn went looking
for some historical precedent. ``If I can't find a prior example of
this I'm not really going to believe it is possible,'' says Allyn,
chief economist at Scudder Kemper Investments, the mutual fund
firm.
</P>
<P>
   To her surprise Allyn found such a period _ the late 19th
century. More specifically, the period between the 1870s and 1900.
Before you start laughing or throwing up objections, you might want
to hear some of the parallels between then and now.
</P>
<P>
   It was a time after a war _ the Civil War, not the Cold War _
when new markets were opening up, when there was plenty of capital
for investment, and free markets were in vogue. Great fortunes were
made in this period (think Carnegie and Rockefeller) and the gap
between the rich and poor widened.
</P>
<P>
   It was also a time when the US economy grew at a robust pace and
prices actually fell. The force behind some of that deflation was
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Allyn has a chart that tracks metal prices between 1865 and
1900. Prices fell steadily during that era, largely because of new
technology for making steel. Oil prices also fell. So did the price
of a camera. When George Eastman began tinkering in the 1870s, a
camera cost about $50, according to Richard Tedlow, a professor at
Harvard Business School. By 1900 Eastman was selling user-friendly
Brownie cameras for a dollar. Remind you of anything?
</P>
<P>
   Tedlow and Allyn both say the two most critical breakthroughs of
the period were the completion of the transcontinental railroad and
the telegraph. The former allowed people to ship goods anywhere in
the country; the latter allowed them to track prices and sales, if
not in real time, in a much shorter time frame than anyone
previously thought possible.
</P>
<P>
   The new infrastructure created opportunities for all sorts of
other businesses. ``Who knew when the railroad was invented that
one day you would be able to slaughter meat in Chicago and sell it
in New York?'' asks Tedlow.
</P>
<P>
   The new economy also gave rise to the first truly national
brands, companies like Coca-Cola and Johnson &AMP; Johnson. For the
first time, corporations could reach a national audience with a
product and a message.
</P>
<P>
   Substitute Amazon.com and EBay for Coke and Johnson &AMP; Johnson,
and you may begin to understand what is happening today, Tedlow
suggests. ``If you want to say the Internet is a transformation
that echoes to some degree the earlier transformation you could
make that parallel,'' says Tedlow.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan also has been thinking about the late 19th
century lately. In his May 6 speech, in which he mused about the
impact of computer technology on the American economy, Greenspan
said, ``Technological change was truly awesome around the turn of
the century. In a very short number of years the world witnessed an
astounding list of new creations: electric power and light, radios,
phonographs, telephones, motion pictures, X-rays, and motor
vehicles, just to begin the list.''
</P>
<P>
   In the next breath, Greenspan concluded that the breakthroughs
of today, while impressive, probably are not as dramatic as those
of the previous century. We may well have a new economy, Greenspan
seems to say, but that doesn't mean we can grow at a breakneck pace
without triggering inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Allyn, too, found some reasons for caution after her tour
through the history books. She points out that the late 19th was a
time of both great growth and great volatility. The good times were
regularly punctuated by panics. There was a strong political
backlash against unregulated markets by those left behind. In the
last century the injured parties were farmers; today they might be
people whose jobs are lost to technology or to competitors in the
Third World.
</P>
<P>
   And there is always the problem of debt. In periods of low
inflation or deflation, says Allyn, debt that looks cheap can prove
very difficult to pay back.
</P>
<P>
   So is history about to repeat itself? Are we in the early stages
of productivity-driven boom that will last for decades? Is the
computer as important as the railroad or electricity?
</P>
<P>
   Who knows. The truth is that when you are in a period of rapid
change it is hard to know whether you are in the middle of a
revolution or merely an evolution. We may have to wait another
century to figure out which one this is.

BARAK BRINGS UNUSUAL TALENTS TO ISRAELI POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The most highly decorated soldier in Israel's
history, Ehud Barak, proved Monday he could marshal his military
skills and the forces loyal to him on Israel's political
battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   But the question ahead for the new prime minister is whether
those abilities as a commander in uniform will serve the country in
achieving ``the unity, and change, and hope'' that he has promised
to deliver.
</P>
<P>
   Short and compact, Barak, 57, does not look the part of the
Israeli hero his lifetime of military accomplishments has made him.
</P>
<P>
   The most enduring image of him in his campaign commercials was a
black-and-white photograph of a young man with thick black hair
standing on the wing of a plane with a pistol strapped to his
waist. The image was broadcast nightly, as he portrayed himself as
a man who will be tough on security issues.
</P>
<P>
   The photograph is from the day after he led his elite commando
unit in the 1972 storming of a hijacked Sabena Airline's passenger
jet and freed the hostages.
</P>
<P>
   His exploits through three decades of conflict in the Middle
East became legendary: the assassination of Arab militants,
intelligence operations behind enemy lines, harrowing helicopter
escapes, and engineered wiretappings straight out of a Tom Clancy
novel.
</P>
<P>
   But the man is complex, somehow shy and brash at the same time.
His face is soft and round, but his movements are stiff and
straight out of the military. He is known to enjoy fixing pocket
watches and clocks, a master of technical engineering. He is a
skilled pianist and relaxes by playing sonatas in the quiet of his
home.
</P>
<P>
   He is a protege of the former general and slain prime minister,
Yitzhak Rabin, who signed the historic Israeli-Palestinian peace
agreeement in 1993 and was killed by a Jewish religious extremist
for it. Barak has said he ``adored'' Rabin and in many ways has
styled his political career after him.
</P>
<P>
   But Barak is also derided by critics on the left for trying to
``out-Bibi Bibi,'' referring by nickname to defeated Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, who has left the peace process deadlocked. As a
freshman member of the Knesset, Israel's parliament, Barak voted
against Rabin's last major agreement with the Palestinians in 1995.
He has maintained a tough image on security throughout his campaign
while simultaneously showing TV ads with photographs of himself
standing beside Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   As one friend put it, he is ``more Rambo than Rabin.''
</P>
<P>
   He was raised on a kibbutz, or collective farm, the son of an
electrician and Polish immigrant. Born Ehud Brog, he changed his
name in 1972 to the Hebrew ``Barak,'' which means ``lightning.''
Its secondary meaning in the Hebrew dictionary is ``bright and
shining.'' He came of age steeped in the secular Zionism of the
founding years of the Israeli state.
</P>
<P>
   After joining the military in 1959, he quickly rose through the
ranks. Within three years, he was a commander in the army's elite
commando unit.
</P>
<P>
   In the Six-Day War in 1967 he served as a reconnaissance group
commander. In the 1973 Middle East War, he was a tank batallion
commander on the southern front in Sinai. At the age of 37, he was
promoted to brigadier general. By 1991, he assumed the post of
chief of staff and the rank of lieutenant general, the highest in
the Israeli military. He has won the Israeli equivalent of five
medals of honor, making him the most decorated soldier in the
nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Shrum, part of the trio of American political strategists
he hired to help him win the election, said his unique technical
skills were evident the first time they met. They gathered in a Tel
Aviv office to discuss political strategy, and Barak was trying to
tell Shrum about technological advances that could improve the way
teleprompters work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who can play Chopin, take a watch apart, tell us that we
should redesign the Teleprompter, run a military, run a campaign,
and in the end master Israeli politics? I don't think I've ever
seen anyone like him,'' said Shrum.
</P>
<P>
   Avshalom Horan, 54, a close friend of Barak since he served in
Barak's elite unit in 1963, said, ``He has an amazing mind, a
combination of technical genius and intuition. He was a brilliant
commander and you could trust your life on his decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The military environment is very nondemocratic, so the
decision-making process is very personal. It is done individually,
and he is very strong at that,'' Horan added.
</P>
<P>
   ``His challenge will be to succeed in achieving unity _ and this
will require something more than military leadership. I think he
can do it, he has already done it in this election. His success
depends on it.''

ALBANIANS BRING TANKS TO BORDER BESEIGED BY SERBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOLAJ, Albania _ The sporadic, mostly one-sided ground war along
the northern Albanian border may not remain lopsided much longer.
</P>
<P>
   As Serbian troops continue to shell a half-dozen nearby
villages, forcing Albanians to abandon their homes, the Albanian
army Monday made what locals described as its first show of
strength in the region. Nine tanks, an armored personnel carrier,
and a truckload of soldiers passed through Golaj midafternoon
Monday, headed in the direction of the Albania-Yugoslavia border,
just kilometers away.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, heavy shelling could be heard and dark plumes of
smoke could be seen in the hills on the Albanian side of the
border. Despite a flash similar to the one that typically
accompanies tank artillary, it was unclear whether the Albanian
soldiers had simply taken up positions or were engaging the Serbian
soldiers in direct conflict for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   But the tanks alone marked an apparant escalation of Albania's
role in the two-month-old conflict. Until now, border skirmishes
have been between Serbian soldiers and the Albanian border patrol
or the Kosovo Liberation Army, which maintains three training camps
in the area. NATO has handled all air strikes, although the US
Army's powerful Apache helicopters have so far gone unused.
</P>
<P>
   The tanks appeared in Kruma, to the south, only minutes after
the monitor with the local office of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe explained that the Albanian army had
likely stayed away to avoid provoking the Serbs. In recent weeks,
shelling by Serbs has emptied at least five border villages and
destroyed three houses. Some displaced Albanians who lived along
the border also spoke of forced labor and killed cattle.
</P>
<P>
   From a short distance, Monday's initial shelling appeared to
take place in Qafa Prushit, where tens of thousands of Kosovar
refugees initially entered Albania on foot to circumvent Serbian
landmines. The border post has been unofficially bombed out of
existences by both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``This seems to be more than a maneuver,'' said Bjorn Kuhne, the
OSCE monitor who followed tanks column from Kurma to Golaj. ``I was
waiting for it. I was surprised the military had stayed so far away
from the border. I'm surprised this took so long.''
</P>
<P>
   Villagers _ both those driven from their home and those
overwhelmed by the influx of Kosovar refugees _ appeared elated by
the army's unexpected presence. All along the winding 30- minute
route on a dirt road, children shouted and waved. The soldiers on
the well-worn, outdated tanks appeared excited too, waving and
smiling as they passed through Golaj going northeast on a road that
dead ends on the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are waiting for the government to do something, but they do
nothing,'' Vehvi Malaj, 53, shouted before the army arrived. ``My
whole village is totally emptied ... we all left together, walking
through the mountain during the night because it was safer.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Bislim Malaj, 55, ``We didn't have time to take anything
but our children and maybe a little food.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with 300 people, the Malajs said, they were forced from
their homes after the Serbs began shelling their village in late
April. Armed with hunting rifles, perhaps 10-15 men sent their
wives and children on and stayed behind to protect their homes. But
the Malajs had no weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Men from another village, Letaj, regularly make the hour hike
from Golaj to their homes under cover of darkness, hunkering down
in the mushroom-shaped bunkers that are everywhere in Albania in
hopes of protecting their property.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia's ethnic cleansing campaign has sent thousands of
refugees pouring into the lush mountainous areas known as the Has
district. Five of its 12 villages have been emptied, and only three
days ago artillery shells landed on the hills of Golaj. Although
the heaviest shelling continues farther to the north, locals must
now take care when they walk, because shell fragments that look
like small cans are sometimes found on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``They shoot at Albanian shepherds; they shoot at Albanian
cows,'' said Letif Koleci, a displaced Albanian, who added that he
had seen Serbs planting land mines inside Albania's borders.
</P>
<P>
   Now Kruma, the district's largest town, has seen its population
more than double to 40,000, with Kosovar refugees and displaced
Albanians. Golaj, whose center is no more than a collection of
crumbling buildings, has doubled in number, too, with 2,100
displaced Albanians and 6,558 refugees now living with host
families there, according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
   Kuhne, the OSCE monitor, said the NATO airstrikes have only
exacerbated the Albanian evacuation, since the Serbs simply hide
from the airplanes and then retaliate with more shelling later.
Serb soldiers have also made brief incursions into Albania to get
rocks for fortifications and to provoke the border police, people
said. Several weeks ago, two villages were hit with fire launchers.
But until Monday's shelling, Kuhne said, ``the Serbian attacks
appeared to be on the wane.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When the shelling started, there really was no KLA presence
around here,''' he said. ``There was no real reason for them to
shell this side of the border, except to clear the border and to
cause chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Albanian government does not officially discuss KLA
operations in the country and the KLA does not officially admit its
presence there, rebel soldiers could be seen around the district
Monday. A half-dozen lunched at a restaurant in Kruma. A man
wearing a KLA teeshirt briefly followed the tank column and ordered
that no photographs be taken.
</P>
<P>
   The three training camps, including one that can hold as many as
1,500 soldiers, are an open secret. The KLA has also tried to
recruit young Kosovars and displaced Albanians who must relocate to
Kruma and the surrounding villages, residents and newcomers said
through a translator Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Now both the people who live in the area and those who were
forced to relocate here are worried that the Serbs will start
shelling farther into the interior. Hoping to get home again, they
don't want to be forced to move south or east or any more than they
already have.

MOTHER WHO LOST SON IN CHECHNYA LOSES QUEST FOR DAMAGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Three summers ago, Alexander Tolbonen, a scrawny lad of
18 only recently drafted into Russia's Interior Ministry army, set
off from his rural northern Russian hometown to fight rebel
guerrillas in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Like thousands of other Russian servicemen who died in the
breakaway region, Tolbonen never came back. Since the day in
September 1996, when she learned of his death, Tolbonen's mother,
Anna, has been trying to get the state to admit it was wrong to
send her only son to war.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, President Boris N. Yeltsin won his day in court over
the war in Chechnya. Anna Tolbonen lost hers. And over two years
after Russian troops withdrew from Chechnya, violence continued to
rock the Caucasus republic.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, lawmakers in the lower house of parliament, the
State Duma, fell 17 votes short of impeaching Yeltsin on the count
of launching the disastrous conflict, which killed an estimated
80,000 people between 1994 and 1996 but failed to quell a
separatist rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   In a much quieter decision, Russia's Supreme Court struck down a
decision by a court in Petrozavodsk, the capital of Tolbonen's home
region of Karelia, that had ordered the Interior Ministry to pay
damages for the loss of her son.
</P>
<P>
   And in events that barely made the news, three Russian officers
were killed in a shootout on the border of Chechnya, bringing the
death toll in such incidents to 10 servicemen in the past month. On
Sunday, an explosion killed five more people at a Russian military
base in Vladikavkaz, a regional capital near Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The violence demonstrated that the May 1997 peace agreement did
not brought peace to Chechnya, which won de facto independence, but
lost all semblance of law and order amid battles by armed factions,
violent crime and kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, after suffering a humiliating defeat of its army to a
poorly armed band of rebels, continues to face loss of life and
ongoing instability in the Caucasus. Meanwhile, the brutal Russian
aerial bombardments of Chechen towns during the war diminished
Russia's prestige as a democratic nation, a stain made no less
embarrassing by Moscow's official indignation over NATO airstrikes
against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The Chechnya conflict gave birth to another irony when Yeltsin
picked Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin to replace Yevgeny
Primakov as prime minister. Opposition lawmakers fought hard to
impeach Yeltsin over his resposibility for Chechnya. But Monday
they seemed at least willing to consider approving Stepashin in a
confirmation vote scheduled for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin, as head of Russian counterintelligence in 1994, was
one of the chief instigators of the failed Chechnya campaign. Poor
intelligence about rebel forces was one of the reasons for Russia's
early setbacks in the war. Stepashin was later fired for botching
an effort to release hostages held by Chechen guerrillas in the
Russian town of Budyennovsk in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the impeachment attempt was about politics, not
justice. The State Duma itself voted down draft resolutions
condemning the war in Chechnya proposed by the antiwar Yabloko bloc
in 1994 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Yabloko leader Grigory Yavlinsky reminded the house that the
remains of nearly 400 unidentified servicemen and civilians killed
in the war still lie in refrigerators in southern Russia, awaiting
burial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boris Nikolayevich has not found money yet to bury the people
whom he himself sent to death,'' Yavlinsky said of Yeltsin on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But Yeltsin is not the only one who has forgotten about
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is extraordinary that Russia has sunk in to almost
immediate amnesia about the war,'' said British journalist Tom de
Waal, author of a book on the Chechnya conflict. ``In any normal
country there would have been political fallout; people would have
resigned; there would have been calls for justice, for
compensation, for lessons to be learned. In Russia there has been a
numbing silence.''
</P>
<P>
   Anna Tolbonen was one mother who tried to break that silence.
Her lawsuit charged that the Interior Ministry was negligent to
send her son, a green draftee, to a deadly conflict. To her
surprise, Petrozavodsk Judge Mikhail Balitsky ordered the Interior
Ministry to pay her $4,000 in damages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boy was 18 years old, he had never fired a gun, he had
never sniffed gumpowder,'' Balitsky said in an interview,
explaining his decision. ``My opinion, as a judge, as a father, is
that it was wrong to send such boys to Chechnya in 1996.''
</P>
<P>
   After winning an appeal to a higher court in April, Tolbonen
invited a reporter to her sparsely furnished home in Sheltozero, a
bumpy two-hour ride south of Petrozavodsk. Her husband, Alexander
Shevchenko, is unable to work because of an injury. Tolbonen
borrows money from neighbors for bread, and feeds her family by
growing vegetables on a small plot.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to talk about her son, she took a framed portrait of the
shelf in her small, sparely furnished apartment and hugged it,
crying softly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired _ I spent all my energy on this, and I'm not sure
it's worth it,'' she said. Three weeks later, the Supreme Court
issued its ruling reversing Balitsky's decision.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Ministry won the appeal by arguing that Tolbonen's
parents are already receiving compensation for his death. That
monthly sum equals about $3.25.
</P>
<P>
   And besides, the ministry's lawyers argued, the military was
only following orders. They suggested that Tolbonen try suing
Yeltsin.

   SKOPJE, Macedonia _ Faton remembers his mother standing on the
balcony of his family apartment waving goodbye as he and his father
left Kosovo March 30. She had expected her husband to return for
her and her other son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bring me a pack of cigarettes on your way back,'' she told her
husband.
</P>
<P>
   But once the pair crossed the border to Macedonia there was no
going back.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Faton, who withheld his last name so as not to endanger
his family, called his mother from a cellular phone for the first
time. He asked simple questions, afraid that anything too detailed
may be misconstrued by eavesdropping Serbs and could be used to
accuse his mother of spying. It's a fear many refugees have when
they call relatives back in Kosovo. They keep the conversations
brief.
</P>
<P>
   Faton's mother uses a friend's telephone. Her own no longer
works.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just called to ask you how are you? When did you get there
(at the friend's apartment)'' Faton asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came about an hour ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How is Beni?'' Faton asked of his older brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's OK. He is watching the news all the time with his
friends. Your grandmother is at home as well. But we check her
apartment every day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have food?'' Faton asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get anything, but you have to wait in long lines for
bread and milk. How are you? Are you eating? Eat a lot of soups,''
she instructed her son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't you try and come here,'' he pleaded, adding that
hundreds of people arrived by train in Macedonia Monday at the
Blace border.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no. We are OK. It's too risky to come. I think it will get
better. It's quieter,'' she said. ``I miss you.''
</P>
<P>
   Faton, 22, did not respond and told her that his father would
also be calling her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love you,'' she told her son, who abruptly hung up the
phone. ``I couldn't bear it,'' he said afterwards. ``I couldn't
finish the conversation. Her last words broke my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Faton's family lived in a two-bedroom apartment on the first
floor of an 11-story building near Pristina's main public library.
Nearly 50 percent of the building's residents are Serbs. Serbian
women visit Faton's mother and tell her that they have to protect
each other: They will protect her from the Serbs if she agrees to
protect them from the Kosovo Liberation Army, the ethnic Albanian
guerrilla group fighting Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   Faton was the first to propose that the family leave Kosovo,
afraid of what the Serbs might to do to him, his sister and
brother, and his father, a professor and doctor of prosthetics and
facial reconstruction. Now his father regrets not taking the rest
of the family with them. He and Faton, staying in separate friends'
apartments in Macedonia, call Pristina a few times a week to check
on the rest of the family. ``It's my fault,'' he said. ``It is
because of me that the family is separated.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Faton, many refugees manage to call their families left
behind in Kosovo. A few, like Faton's grandmother, return home
despite the danger. ``She just took a bus and left. She wasn't
afraid,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pristina may be a little safer than many places. According to
aid organizations, most of the refugees crossing the border have
been coming from villages. Sunday's train carrying 600 people _
twice as many as the day before _ arrived from villages west and
south of Pristina. Aid organizations said some of the people
voluntarily left because the Serbs robbed them of all their
valuables and food. ``Even though they are not being forced from
their homes, they can no longer exist,'' said UN High Commissioner
of Refugees spokesman Ron Redmond. He added: ``Serbs forces are
blending in with civilians,'' bolstering NATO claims that Serb
forces may be using ethnic Albanians as human shields.
</P>
<P>
   One man said that the Serb police are placed throughout the
villages. ``It's a lie that (they're) withdrawing,'' he said,
boarding a bus that was to take him to a refugee camp.

IMAGES BELIED AS SUNUNU GIVES QUAYLE SUPPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ On the surface, they are the oddest of odd
couples.
</P>
<P>
   John H. Sununu, the former governor of New Hampshire, is known
for his brilliance and his brusqueness. Dan Quayle, the former vice
president, is known for his speaking and spelling gaffes and still
battles an image as an intellectual also-ran.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Sununu is championing Quayle for president,
recruiting Republican supporters on his promise that Quayle is
fully up to the nation's top job.
</P>
<P>
   Around the state, political observers whisper that this is
Sununu's revenge against Governor George W. Bush of Texas, who
pushed to get Sununu fired from his job as White House chief of
staff for President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Sununu first pledged himself to Quayle in 1993, before
the younger Bush was elected governor of Texas and began to nurse
White House ambitions. Quayle took a pass on a presidential
campaign in 1996, but Sununu's offer of support held firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been right there with me, every step of the way,'' Quayle
said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Sununu: ``Contrary to the image the press has created, I
think he's one of the smartest politicians out there, the smartest
of the crowd I see running for president.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sununu name is legend in New Hampshire politics, home of the
first-in-the-nation primary and a traditional springboard to the
nomination. In 1988, it was Sununu, then the Granite State's
governor, who resuscitated Vice President George Bush's candidacy,
which had been badly damaged in the Iowa caucuses by Senator Bob
Dole of Kansas and the Rev. Pat Robertson, founder of the Christian
Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Bush limped into New Hampshire with his third-place Iowa finish
at about 1 o'clock in the morning. There to greet him at the
airport was Sununu, ready with a plan, a strong grass-roots
organization, and calming words. He took Bush to all the right
places, where he was photographed driving an 18-wheel truck and
throwing snowballs with a group of children, and Bush traded a suit
for more casual dress, all in an effort to connect with the voters
and regain momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Seven days after the Iowa caucuses, Bush won the primary, and
Sununu got much of the credit. Now, 11 years later, he is turning
his attention to rescuing Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would someone as smart and forceful and direct and as
competitive as John Sununu line themselves up with someone he
didn't think capable of living up to the task of performing
competitively for the nomination? He wouldn't,'' said Patrick J.
Griffin, a Republican strategist who recently left Lamar
Alexander's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   What remains to be seen, however, is whether Sununu still has
the juice to deliver in New Hampshire, more than a decade after he
left the governor's office.
</P>
<P>
   In the White House, Sununu and Quayle grew close, as friends and
colleagues. Sununu and Quayle's offices in the West Wing were no
more than four steps apart, and the two men spoke constantly. They
are both firmly conservative, sharing many political and
philosophical views, including a hawkish stance on national
security. In fact, Sununu was probably closer to Quayle
ideologically than he ever was with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Sununu was a fighter for George Bush,'' Quayle said of
his national cochairman. ``He was the one who would go out and
defend George Bush. You notice that when John Sununu left, things
fell apart. They never recovered.''
</P>
<P>
   Sununu served as chief of staff for three years, until he was
done in by bad publicity and, perhaps, bad judgment. Sununu left
Bush's staff in 1991 after a White House ethics investigation found
that he had improperly used Air Force executive jets and government
limousines for personal and political trips.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle, however, blamed others in the White House for ``trying
to do him in,'' brushing off suggestions that Sununu did anything
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very tough, opinionated chief of staff,'' Quayle
said. ``When you're tough in that town and you talk common sense
and you don't back down, you're going to make enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle's tenure as vice president was also rocky. He suffered
from the gibes of White House staffers, a subterranean ``dump
Quayle'' effort in 1992, and frequent ridicule in the press _
particularly after he urged a New Jersey schoolboy to add an ``e''
when spelling potato.
</P>
<P>
   On the stump, Quayle often alludes to his past troubles by
telling voters that he has been put to the test and has persevered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who has been through the meat grinder and now is back up on
his feet?'' he asked a staunch antiabortion crowd at the Concord
Pregnancy Care Center recently.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Quayle viewed Sununu's ouster from the White House as
undeserved, so Sununu views attacks on Quayle's intelligence as
cheap and unfair. When Quayle was vice president, Sununu said, he
was ``active'' and ``involved in everything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When things were going tough up on the Hill, with the House
and the Senate, his experience and his friends and relationships
with former colleagues was invaluable,'' said Sununu, who now works
as a consultant in Washington and serves as cohost of CNN's
``Crossfire'' program.
</P>
<P>
   Vouching for Quayle is part of Sununu's job in the campaign.
When Sununu was recruiting Ovide Lamontagne, the 1996 Republican
candidate for governor, to serve as Quayle's New Hampshire
chairman, his words of support reassured Lamontagne and sealed the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only a handful of people in the country who had the
eyewitness experience of watching and working with Dan Quayle,''
said Lamontagne, a Manchester attorney. ``The thing that Governor
Sununu's personal testimony did for me was to validate what I
believed to be the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the political expectations for Quayle are low, with 11
Republicans running for president. Sununu has even coined a phrase
for the resistance Quayle has run into, calling it ``the next-door
neighbor syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People will say, `I really agree with you, with everything you
say, but how are you going to convince my neighbor?' So you go and
talk to the neighbor, and the neighbor says, `I really agree with
you and everything you say, but how are you going to convince my
neighbor?' '' Sununu said. ``A lot of people have this positive
image of him, but they think everyone else does not.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer is for Quayle to spend as much time as possible in
Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina, allowing voters to get to
know him, Sununu said.
</P>
<P>
   And Quayle needs to get on television and talk about serious
issues, he said. ``When people see the unfiltered Dan Quayle, they
walk away saying, `That's the man who should be president.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Sununu said he's not worried that Quayle is far from the head of
the pack, 10 months out from the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen things change very quickly in politics,'' he said.
``Anybody who's talking about front-runners should talk to
President Connolly, President Romney, President Muskie, or
President Hart.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is awkward for both Sununu and Quayle to be at odds
with former President Bush, working against his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difficult thing in primary politics if you're active is
you always have to choose among friends,'' Sununu said, adding that
he loves the Bush family, including George W.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle is less delicate on the subject of Governor Bush, saying
the Republican establishment is making ``a big mistake'' by
flocking to an untested candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got members of Congress supporting him, and they've
never even met him,'' Quayle said in amazement. ``What it shows is,
the party is nervous. They are nervous, and if they end up just
going with polls, I think it's going to be a recipe for disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   But is it uncomfortable to run against a Bush?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be awkward for him, too,'' said Quayle. ``You
have to ask him, how does it feel to run against your father's
handpicked vice president?''

   ACTON, Mass. _ Small and boxy, the metronome that ticks away
atop the rebuilt Steinway in Bronika Kushkuley's living room does
immeasurably more than mark precise time for Haydn's ``E Minor
Sonata.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the critical clock of her young life, rhythmically
defining sharp segments of a tightly disciplined world.
</P>
<P>
   It signals when she must train as the acclaimed concert pianist
whose work already has carried her twice to Carnegie Hall. Its
silence means she can be just a kid _ a bright-eyed girl chasing
her chubby puppy across a sun-drenched lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Kushkuley is a prodigy, an 11-year-old performer who has cut a
self-titled CD, is featured on her own Web page, has performed
across Europe, and triumphed at international competitions from
Washington to Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Her gift is both a blessing and a challenge. It demands a
delicate balance to ensure that her music is nurtured but does not
climb to a crescendo that overwhelms other telling tones that echo
in any preteen's world.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you play the piano all day, I don't think that's a very
good idea,'' Kushkuley said last week, sitting beneath a cloudless
sky on the back steps of her parents' tri-level home here.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want your music to express this day, or the springtime,
or the trees and stuff, if you don't go outside sometimes, you
can't really play that way,'' she said, ``because you won't have
the feel of it.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when some parents are under assault for paying too
little attention to the details of their children's lives,
Kushkuley's parents say they are taking care to avoid an opposing
offense common in the homes of overachievers: paying too much
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Bronika left her elementary school to concentrate on the piano,
but her parents say they are seeking to provide their daughter with
a childhood with a premium on normalcy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not pushing,'' said Larissa Kushkuley, Bronika's mother.
``We're not trying to push her to make her a pianist at this age,
or to make her a concert pianist right now. We want her to get the
best education possible, which she needs. And then we'll just see
what she does.''
</P>
<P>
   What Bronika Kushkuley already has done is remarkable _
attaining a musical fluency that her Latvian-born parents scarcely
could have imagined when they immigrated to the United States in
1988, relieved to have escaped the oppression of their native land.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted to raise our children without Soviet
brainwashing,'' said Larissa Kushkuley, who like her husband
Alexander, is a computer programmer.
</P>
<P>
   Lovers of classical music but not musicians themselves, the
Kushkuleys settled first in Burlington in a small apartment they
found with the help of Temple Shalom Emeth. Later, they moved to a
modest home on a quiet street here, where the television is almost
always dark and the bookshelves bear trophies topped by musical
notes and the classics of Homer and Steinbeck and Swift.
</P>
<P>
   Then, five years ago, the parents of three made a simple
decision that would rearrange their lives: They enrolled their
children in piano lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really didn't think about great talent or anything,''
Larissa Kushkuley said.
</P>
<P>
   But after Bronika won the 1995 International Young Artists Piano
Competition in Washington, an after-school hobby intensified into a
full-time passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really gave us the idea that she really had to devote
more of her time to music,'' the pianist's mother said.
</P>
<P>
   That devotion has transported the Kushkuleys onto the unfamiliar
terrain of the talented _ a landscape where there are few clear
guideposts, many emotional land mines, and critics at every corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about this phenomenon that really bothers
most of us,'' said David Henry Feldman, a child development
professor at Tufts University who has studied child prodigies for
two decades. ``On the one hand we're admiring of it. On the other,
it gets to us. It makes us uneasy. It threatens us to some
degree.''
</P>
<P>
   Feldman said that common concerns about the loss of childhood or
the exploitation of youthful genius, while often on target, can
sometimes be misplaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``The talent changes everything,'' he said. ``We can't make them
into being just like us except for having this talent. It's just
not true. It's irresponsible. We celebrate diversity, but somehow
or another this kind of diversity we just can't grasp. It's just
different. It's like being in a different culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Winner, a psychology professor at Boston College and
author of ``Gifted Children: Myths and Realities,'' said unwilling
children pushed by their parents can emerge from the experience
sad, broken, and unable to pursue their talent into adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   ``But all the research shows that these kids are extremely
driven,'' Winner said. ``I call it the rage to master. You can't
tear them away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lay out all these cautions and dangers. But in some cases
it's not clear what should be done differently, because these kids
so desperately want to be spending their time focusing on their
domain of gift.''
</P>
<P>
   For up to five hours a day, that is precisely what Bronika
Kushkuley is deeply focused on, her bashful smile supplanted by a
serious resolve as her hands dance and fly across the keyboard, her
body swaying and leaning into the music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I think I have talent, but I don't think I'm great or
anything,'' she said. ``If you start thinking that you're a
prodigy, and you start saying, `Oh, I'm so good,' you'll start
playing worse.''
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't happened. Almost from the beginning, the music that
emerged when Bronika put her fingers to the piano keys was
something extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is unbelievably talented and deeply in love with the
music,'' said Julia Bernstein, an instructor at the New England
Conservatory, who has taught Kushkuley since she was 6 years old.
``I think she's one of the best of her age at least in the country,
but maybe the world, too. Other kids who have the same ability
don't have her discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   In the basement of Bernstein's home in Randolph, where Kushkuley
studies three times a week, student and teacher communicate with
each other in a lexicon of hand gestures, facial expressions,
clapping hands, snapping fingers, sung notes, and overt expressions
of displeasure or encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just loud, it's deep and serious,'' Bernstein tells
Kushkuley at one point. The student's worried visage melts into a
broad smile when Bernstein finally declares: ``Yes! Yes! Exactly!
Much better.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, over a cup of tea, the teacher explained: ``Everything I
blow to her, she just catches it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the solo recitals, far-flung competitions, CD recordings,
and international awards have not come without a price. The tempo
of the Kushkuley family's daily routine is kept by demands of piano
lessons for their three children, but most markedly by the rigors
of Bronika's training and a decision last year to shift her
education from the local elementary school to a home-schooling
regimen of mathematics, English, and social studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``She liked going to school,'' Larissa Kushkuley said. ``But she
really likes playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bronika's connection to her old school now comes from stories
told by her 13-year-old sister, Sophie, and her 10-year-old
brother, Jacob, who she greets with a smile from her post at the
piano bench one midafternoon recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have enough time to play the piano as much as I
should play,'' Bronika explained later as her new dog Constance, a
fuzzy chow chow, played friskily at her feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a choice: Either play the piano really well or go to
school. And I decided to play the piano. I don't really miss it,
but sometimes I feel lonely. I liked that there were a lot of kids.
Like right now, I don't have a very big choice of friends.''
</P>
<P>
   But she quickly noted that an old school pal is a frequent
visitor and that she has developed a pen-pal friendship with
Francesca, a violinist she met at a festival in Germany last year.
When the piano is quiet, she's upstairs playing with her American
Girls doll Samantha, running, swimming, reading, or writing stories
and poems _ available to visitors of her Web page.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are actually thinking that we are led by her because we
never envisioned that we would home-school one of our kids,'' said
Larissa Kushkuley. ``It just somehow grew up and we don't want to
put barriers in her world. We're trying to help out and see how the
situation develops.''
</P>
<P>
   Specialists say there is no true barometer to measure whether
young talent will survive the almost unavoidable emotional strains
of adolescence and blossom into acclaim in adulthood.

   ``Just because a kid is a star at the age of 11 doesn't mean
that they're going to continue to go that route,'' said Joseph
Thayer, dean of the Colburn School of Performing Arts in Los
Angeles, a distinguished school for young performers. ``Some
prodigies make it; some lose interest and do other stuff.''

   The Kushkuleys say they are preparing for either outcome, ready

   ``With all our kids we don't make any distinctions about who is
better, who is worse,'' Larissa Kushkuley said. ``We don't do that.
If (Bronika) doesn't do her chores, she'd get punished. We try to
keep it as normal as possible. But people do like to hear her in
concert.''
</P>
<P>
   And as Bronika Kushkuley polishes her material for a May 22
benefit concert at Brandeis University, where she will share the
stage with renowned cellist-conductor Mstislav Rostropovich, she
said it's the music, not the acclaim, that drives her.

   ``I want to go to some really major competitions and play my
best, but I really don't care if I win,'' the pianist said during a
break in practice sessions. ``It just doesn't matter. Because you
know (Russian-born pianist Vladimir) Horowitz? He didn't win a
single competition in his life. So, you see, it doesn't really
matter.''

SOME LESBIANS FEEL LEFT OUT OF THEIR `HOME TOWN' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDITH GAINES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHAMPTON, Mass. _ In the opening of ``Home Town,'' author
Tracy Kidder, perched atop Mount Holyoke, gazes out over
Northampton, the subject of his latest nonfiction book:
</P>
<P>
   ``From the summit . . . the town seems entirely coherent,
self-contained, a place where a person might live a whole life and
consider it complete,'' he writes. ``The town below fits in the
palm of your hand. Shake it and it snows.''
</P>
<P>
   If this suggests to readers that Kidder will be describing the
key parts of this community and what makes it distinctive, then
they probably will be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Kidder's ``Home Town'' is peopled by remarkable and compelling
characters, residents said, but it isn't the Northampton they know.
They were particularly surprised by his slight discussion of the
the lesbian community, which is so prominent some have dubbed the
city ``Lesbianville.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His book doesn't reflect the everyday experience of most
people who live here,'' said Julie Pokela, a lesbian business
leader and former head of the Chamber of Commerce. ``It was more a
book about Tommy O'Connor than about Northampton.''
</P>
<P>
   Shake Kidder's book and it goes to the police.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor is a gentle, street-savvy cop whose humane dealings
with the town's underbelly form the spine of Kidder's book. Other
central figures include Alan Scheinman, a lawyer with an
obsessive-compulsive disorder; Laura Baumeister, a single mother on
welfare trying to get through Smith College; and Judge Michael
Ryan, a compassionate local judge.
</P>
<P>
   Defending his choice of characters, Kidder, who lives in
Williamsburg, explained, ``I didn't set out to do sociology or
political science. I tell the stories of people I found
interesting, people whose lives intersect with the town in
meaningful ways. I couldn't write about everything.''
</P>
<P>
   At Beyond Words bookstore, where Kidder's book was selling
``about 10 times faster than a normal best-seller,'' according to
co-owner Jeff Krauth, some readers feel slighted.
</P>
<P>
   Krauth noted that Kidder largely omits discussion of the town's
arts community (rated No. 1 in the United States in John Villani's
1998 book, ``The 100 Best Small Art Towns in America''); its
vibrant music scene; the unusually large number of professionals
devoted to holistic health and spiritual development; all the
mom-and-pop (or mom-and-mom) stores with distinctive personalities,
and more.
</P>
<P>
   But most surprising of all was the absence of a single openly
homosexual character in the book, although Kidder mentions unnamed
lesbians several times in passing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the biggest gap,'' said Sunia Hood, owner of Taxi's Dog
Bakery. ``The lesbians are hugely important in making Northampton
what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Although no formal count has been taken, Mayor Mary Ford
estimated that about 4,500 self-identified lesbians live in this
town of 29,000, or about one in every seven residents. Including
the surrounding area, she said the lesbian population probably
amounts to 10,000 _ an estimate accepted by several lesbian
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The influence of this female energy is visible everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Three city councilors, including its president, a local judge
and a former head of the Chamber of Commerce all are openly
lesbian. Staff at the local Unitarian church say about one-third of
its weddings are commitment ceremonies for lesbians, and the local
paper, The Daily Hampshire Gazette, regularly prints announcements
of these unions.
</P>
<P>
   Northampton has a 90-member Lesbian and Gay Business Guild, a
lesbian softball league with 15 teams, an annual lesbian parade, a
lesbian calendar of events, a bookstore that sells only books by
women, and dozens of lesbian support groups.
</P>
<P>
   A special business card offering 10 to 20 percent discounts for
lesbians and their supporters is in the offing. One phone card on
sale and advertisements in lesbian newsletters proudly proclaim
that this is ``Lesbianville, U.S.A.''
</P>
<P>
   What is most remarkable about the large lesbian presence, some
locals said, is how well it has been accepted politically,
economically and socially.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can pretty much walk the streets without being harrassed,''
said Aimee Ross, a self-described ``bearded lady'' with 27 rings
and other adornments piercing various parts of her anatomy.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Ford stressed that the fault lines in town don't break in
terms of sexual preference. ``The gay folks have never put forward
a single-issue agenda or tried to be the dominant group,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, she claimed, the typical ``we-they'' hostilities
that plague many other small towns hardly exist here.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he didn't write more about Northampton's lesbian
population, Kidder said that he didn't find anyone who was willing
to open up her life to him, although he added that he didn't try
hard to find someone. Also, he said, it ``seemed trite, or stupid,
to define someone in terms of their sexuality. I thought it wasn't
an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Some lesbians agreed, breathing a sigh of relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're tired of all the public focus on our sex lives,'' said
Robyn Camarata, a volunteer at a lesbian and gay gift shop called
Pride and Joy. ``We're strong enough on our own not to need every
book that comes along to mention us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the ultimate goal of the whole movement _ not to be an
issue,'' said Jane, co-owner of an all-women's bed-and-breakfast,
who asked that her last name not be used.
</P>
<P>
   But others said the way lesbians have melted into the town is so
unusual that it deserves serious literary attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are other gay enclaves, but there's no place I know
where the gay population is so integrated into the community,''
Pokela said.
</P>
<P>
   She attributed this to the conjunction of several developments
in the past 25 years: the presence of an open-minded population at
Smith and the four other colleges nearby; the growth of the gay
rights movement; deinstitutionalization of the state's mental
health wards, creating a range of human-service jobs; and the size
of Northampton, which discouraged segregation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The town is too small and the lesbian population is too big to
have ghettos,'' Pokela said.
</P>
<P>
   Mulling this over, Kidder concluded, ``If there's a fault in the
book, it's that I didn't convey clearly enough how remarkable it is
that Northampton is on the way to being a place where (being
homosexual) doesn't matter any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the moral of the story, said Mayor Ford, ``is that Tracy
should write more books. Or other people should write a book about
the lesbian community here.''
</P>
<P>
   But for now, at least, most of Kidder's readers said they are
willing to forgive him his omissions. In this town where
intellectual inquiry and free-spiritedness are celebrated, many
grant an artist the license to paint the portrait he sees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's his book. He gets to write about whatever interests
him,'' said Clare Higgins, the city council president, who is
openly gay.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much that is left out _ but that's the nature of
trying to capture what you can't really capture,'' said Carol
Edelstein, a poet and social worker.
</P>
<P>
   But what Kidder tried to do, he did tenderly and well, she and
others said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's writing in a warm and extremely humane, poetic way about
people for whom Northampton was a community before it became a hot
spot for artists and gays and people who like fancy restaurants,''
said Robert MacLachlan, a retired psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   Since the book appeared in bookstores in mid-April, it has
sparked discussion all over town about the kind of place
Northampton is, how it sees its identity.
</P>
<P>
   When Kidder appeared for a reading at the Broadside Bookshop,
450 people turned out to hear him. The conversations about ``Home
Town'' are lively but not irate, and no protests are expected by
those who feel overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about why lesbians aren't angry about being left out of
Kidder's book, Higgins pointed to the tolerant spirit that has made
Northampton what it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we all get along so well out here,'' she quipped.

 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1999 Special to The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A survey of recently published books:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; THE HUNGRY OCEAN &QL; 
 &UR; Linda Greenlaw (Hyperion, $22.95)
</P>
<P>
   Linda Greenlaw's well-worn copy of Sebastian Junger's book,
``The Perfect Storm,'' falls open automatically to Page 30. That's
where Junger describes Greenlaw in terms only a commercial
fisherman could love: ``Not only is (she) one of the only women in
the business, she's one of the best captains, period, on the entire
East Coast,'' he writes. ``Year after year, trip after trip, she
makes more money than almost anyone else.'' That money, which she
brings in catching swordfish as captain of the Hannah Boden out of
Gloucester, Mass., is a source of enormous pride to Greenlaw. She
has been going to sea for 18 years now and has worked hard, in the
company of some interesting men. ``If they weren't colorful before
we left dock,'' she says, ``they surely were when we returned.''
She has never encountered any problems because she is a woman _
maybe she's thick-skinned, she says, ``or just too damn busy
working to worry about what others might think of me.'' ``The
Perfect Storm'' brought Greenlaw much attention (the Hannah Boden
was the sister ship of Junger's subject, the ``Andrea Gail,'' which
sank with six men in a terrible storm at sea in 1991). It also
brought her the opportunity to write this book, in which she tells
the story of a typicah swordfishing trip from start to finish. The
language is salty, the men are colorful and the stories are
terrific. Sadly, she ends with the death of Bob Brown, the
irascible perfectionist who owned both the ``Hannah Boden'' and the
``Andrea Gail,'' for whom Greenlaw felt admiration and affection. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; THE AMERICAN CENTURY: ART &AMP; CULTURE 1900-1950 &QL; 
 &UR; Barbara Haskell (Norton, $60)
</P>
<P>
   It seems we will never finish scrutinizing and defining the
closing century. Now, the Whitney Museum of American Art is at bat
and swinging for the high seats. This is the first of two volumes
accompanying the museum's nine-month exhibit devoted to America's
evolution over the past 100 years into an artistic and cultural
force. Although the exhibit itself has drawn some sniping, the book
is a visual treat _ the abundance of wonderful things to look at
takes the edge off the bravado of the title (Americans might just
decide that it isn't such a stretch after all). Haskell's text is
stodgy by comparison, but bolstered by a series of livelier
mini-essays by experts in music, dance, theater, literature and
film. All of this is presented in four chapters: ``America in the
Age of Confidence: 1900-1919,'' ``Jazz Age America: 1920-1929,''
``America in Crisis: 1930-1939'' and ``War and its Aftermath:
1940-1949.'' The companion volume, ``The American Century: Art &AMP;
Culture 1950-2000'' by Lisa Phillips, will be published in
October. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; THE COMPLETE ANGLER: A CONNECTICUT YANKEE FOLLOWS IN THE FOOTSTEPS
OF WALTON &QL; 
 &UR; James Prosek (HarperCollins, $30)
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't Prosek's first idea. He had tried repeatedly to
persuade Yale University to give him a traveling fellowship,
proposing, among other things, that he fish the headwaters of the
Tigris River in eastern Turkey, the site of Eden in Milton's
``Paradise Lost.'' ``I'd told the judges on the committee that I
thought I would glean some great wisdom from catching trout that
were descendants of those which had witnessed man's fall from
Paradise,'' he says. ``They didn't bite.'' So, he tried again. He
said he would fish in the footsteps of Izaak Walton, the gentle
Englishman who in 1653 wrote ``The Compleat Angle''r; behind the
Bible and the works of Shakespeare, it is the most reprinted book
in the English language, with more than 400 editions produced in
300 years. Prosek told the committee that Walton's words moved him,
that the book took the art of angling to a higher level. He lied;
at that point, he hadn't read it. But after the committee gave him
his fellowship, he picked up ``The Compleat Angler,'' and soon he
believed his lie. ``Fishing is my religion and the trout stream is
my temple,'' Prosek writes, we assume with a straight face. ``Izaak
Walton was the angler's Messiah, and I was prepared to go on this
pilgrimage to England and meet the people who were connected with
Walton's ideals.'' This book is the story of his trip. It's mostly
text with a few (not nearly enough) of Prosek's watercolors
sprinkled throughout. Those of you who follow these things will
recognize him as the author of 1996's ``Trout: An Illustrated
History,'' which was published when he was not yet 20. Now 23, he
is still fishing and still lobbying for fellowships. For his next
book, he is circling the globe, fishing along the 41st parallel,
the approximate latitude of his Connecticut home. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; A WALK IN THE WOODS &QL; 
 &UR; Bill Bryson (Broadway, $13)
</P>
<P>
   At long last, a trade paperback edition of Bryson's hilarious
account of hiking the Appalachian Trail with his long-suffering and
out-of-shape friend, Stephen Katz. Bryson's motives in undertaking
the hike were admirable. He wanted to become fit after years of
wattlesome sloth. He wanted to learn survival skills, to feel like
an equal among men with camouflage pants and Bowie knives. He
wanted to be like Daniel Boone, who, Bryson knew, not only wrestled
bears but dated their sisters. Then, he hit the trail and started
backpedaling fast. Here he alternates chapters that contain actual
information about the Appalachian Trail with very funny chapters
about his misadventures in the company of the vulgar but endearing
Katz. It's a delightful book _ if you missed it in hardcover, now's
your chance. &QL;

<P>
   The new ``Star Wars'' prequel is good enough, but only just.
It's got the hardware, but neither the characters, the imagination,
nor the resonance one had hoped for. What fans will want to know,
now that the hype can be replaced with actuality, is whether ``The
Phantom Menace'' is sufficiently of a piece with the first three
films to make it worth seeing. The answer is yes, but not by much.
George Lucas, perhaps inevitably drawn back into the ``Star Wars''
gravitational field, has talked a lot about technological
razzle-dazzle not being nearly as important as the characters and
story. But the truth is that it's the visuals and the new screenful
of computer-generated whiz-bangs and other toys that drive ``The
Phantom Menace.'' Character and personality take a back seat on
this ride.
</P>
<P>
   The kids toward whom the new film is frankly skewed will storm
the malls and multiplexes to see Ewan McGregor's Obi-Wan Kenobi as
a young hothead Jedi warrior, how Obi-Wan's wise mentor, Liam
Neeson's Qui-Gon Jinn, teaches him control, and how they both
discovered Jake Lloyd's prodigy, Anakin Skywalker, before he even
knew there was such a thing as The Force, much less a Dark Side of
it. R2-D2 and C-3PO (before he got the skin job that made him gold
and shiny) are on hand, too. We're also introduced to Natalie
Portman's young queen Amidala, who becomes the mother of Luke and
Leia; to Samuel L. Jackson's Mace Windu, whose role as a Jedi
Council mainstay is so small you know he'll be back in later
episodes; and to Ahmed Best's comic relief, Jar Jar Binks, a
rubber-limbed amphibian Gumby figure who talks funny and walks
clumsy and brightens the rather long and lightweight film a lot.
</P>
<P>
   In short, there's a lot that's eye-filling in ``The Phantom
Menace,'' but not much that's brain-filling, and nobody is going to
think of it as soul food. Its high point isn't even the space or
land battles one has come to expect of ``Star Wars.'' It's a
chariot race right out of ``Ben-Hur,'' except that it takes place
on the desert planet of Tatooine, its chariots are jet-powered
jalopy pods, and young Anakin looks like a World War I flying ace
as he challenges the nasty champ in a contest whose ultimate winner
will be Nintendo; pod race games will fly off the shelves as fast
as laser swords.
</P>
<P>
   Great pains were taken to make the gear in ``Phantom Menace''
look less sleek and evolved than in ``Star Wars,'' a reasonable
enough decision since it takes place three decades earlier. Jabba
the Hutt, who figures briefly, even looks less blobby than the
heavyweight we meet later. Looking at Lloyd's smart, tough,
empathetic Anakin has the effect of making us dread what we know
will later be his downfall. But the fact is that there isn't much
emotional tug this time around. ``The Phantom Menace'' is bland,
perhaps not surprisingly considering the difficulty of conjuring up
the freshness and wonder with which the original burst upon the
scene.
</P>
<P>
   Although technically slicker, this installment isn't nearly as
involving as ``Star Wars'' or ``The Empire Strikes Back.'' (By the
time ``Return of the Jedi'' came out, there was a noticeable
drop-off in energy and inspiration _ a trend that continues here.)
There's no equivalent here of Alec Guinness's twinkling wisdom,
Harrison Ford's unruliness, or the looming ominousness of the grown
Darth Vader. Lucas has written better stuff here for his Industrial
Light &AMP; Magic computers than he has for the people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Phantom Menace'' mutes McEwan's Obi-Wan and Neeson's
Qui-Gon to the point where we grow detached enough to speculate on
possible influences on aspects the new film. When Qui-Jon and
Obi-Wan visit Anakin's mother, learn about the remarkable
circumstances surrounding the boy's birth, and ask her permission
to take her son from slavery on Tatooine to a life as an apprentice
Jedi knight, the moment seems to echo, intentionally or not,
``Citizen Kane.'' Visually, the idyllic capital of Naboo, the
peaceful planet ruled by Amidala and coveted by the trouble-making
Dark Lord of the Sith, suggests a cross between Marin County and
the patina-domed campuses of Stanford and the University of
California at Berkeley. The elaborate sci-fi towers of the
Federation's capital city of Coruscant suggest ``Metropolis''
passed through a computer. Darth Maul, the bad guy in the climactic
laser sword fight, suggests a hooded wannabe from the rock group
KISS. Lucas even has fun with ``Monday Night Football'' in the
character of a two-headed announcer at the pod races. The big
victory celebration seems like a halftime show.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Steven Spielberg's ``Jurassic Park'' dissolved the line
between movies and theme parks, so ``The Phantom Menace'' dissolves
the line between movies and merchandising. It's its own giant
exercise in product placement. It's hard to believe that McGregor's
Obi-Wan and Portman's Amidala won't be given juicier material in
episodes two and three. Even allowing for the inevitably
overinflated expectations connected to this overinflated event,
``The Phantom Menace'' is more fizzle than sizzle. Although it at
least avoids disaster, it brings to mind an exchange at Lucas's
recent press conference in New York. When I asked the director what
was at stake for him with this movie, personally and
professionally, he replied, ``Nothing.'' Perhaps that's the trouble
with it.

AFTER `STAR WARS,' PREQUELS SURE TO BE A MENACE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   George Lucas did not invent the prequel, although ``Star Wars:
Episode 1 _ The Phantom Menace'' may turn out to be Hollywood's
first billion-dollar back story.
</P>
<P>
   Larry McMurtry's ``Lonesome Dove'' _ Pulitzer-winning novel and
Emmy-winning miniseries _ spawned both a prequel (``Dead Man's
Walk'') and a sequel (``Streets of Laredo''). Director David Lynch
time-tripped backwards from ``Twin Peaks,'' a TV series few viewers
could fathom, to ``Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me,'' a
preamble-ulatory movie few could stomach.
</P>
<P>
   The libretto to Wagner's operatic ``Ring'' cycle was composed in
reverse chronological order, one trick even Lucas hasn't attempted.
``The Flintstones'' movie, dreadful as it was, is getting prequeled
right now _ for reasons only its producers know. Even modern
classics like ``Casablanca'' and ``Gone With the Wind,'' once
thought to be perfect as is, have undergone the by-now requisite
prequel/sequel expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Will ``Phantom Menace'' be the last word in first installments?
Don't bet on it. And don't be surprised to see these in
development, either:
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare in Puberty'': A prologue to ``Shakespeare in
Love,'' this romantic comedy chronicles the budding Bard's ``lost''
years at Stratford Grammar School. Will (James Van Der Beek) wakes
one morning to find his hormones raging and his teenage fancy
turning to thoughts of love. Mocked by his schoolmates (Casey
Affleck, Josh Brolin) for preferring sonnet writing to squirrel
hunting, Will moons and sulks while passing syrupy notes to comely
classmate Anne Hathway (Sarah Michelle Gellar), who is instantly
smitten. The two agree to do a senior biology project together.
Alas, the experiment gets out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, disapproving father Richard Hathway (Brian Dennehy)
dismisses young Will as a ``noxious dweeb'' until he catches the
young couple in love's embrace and challenges Will to a duel,
wherepon young Shakespeare's consummate swordsmanship wins over
both father and daughter. With Anne suddenly pregnant, Will
renounces medical college for a life in the theater. `` 'Tis my
destiny, love,'' he explains on his way out the door.

Witherspoon) go to Daytona Beach for spring vacation, drink a lot
of beer, smoke a little dope, go skinny dipping, borrow a
speedboat, accidently run over an old fisherman (Marlon Brando),
sink his skiff, drink some more beer, wrap the body in oilskin,
smoke more dope, stash the body in an abandoned lighthouse, walk
down to the beach, take their clothes off, go skinny-dipping by
moonlight, fly home, return to their dorm rooms, unpack, undress,
take long, hot showers, look out the window, notice it's raining,
decide to take a walk after dark anyway, encounter a menacing
stranger wearing an oilskin slicker, freak out, call each other on
their cell phones, agree to meet for sushi, swear each other to
everlasting silence, exchange nervous glances as the sushi chef
slices up a triple order of tekka maki, drink some more beer, swear
once more not to breathe a word about the boating accident to
anyone, and plan a carefree summer working as lighthouse keepers
along the Maine coast.

SOME LESBIANS FEEL LEFT OUT OF THEIR `HOME TOWN' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDITH GAINES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHAMPTON, Mass. _ In the opening of ``Home Town,'' author
Tracy Kidder, perched atop Mount Holyoke, gazes out over
Northampton, the subject of his latest nonfiction book:
</P>
<P>
   ``From the summit . . . the town seems entirely coherent,
self-contained, a place where a person might live a whole life and
consider it complete,'' he writes. ``The town below fits in the
palm of your hand. Shake it and it snows.''
</P>
<P>
   If this suggests to readers that Kidder will be describing the
key parts of this community and what makes it distinctive, then
they probably will be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Kidder's ``Home Town'' is peopled by remarkable and compelling
characters, residents said, but it isn't the Northampton they know.
They were particularly surprised by his slight discussion of the
the lesbian community, which is so prominent some have dubbed the
city ``Lesbianville.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His book doesn't reflect the everyday experience of most
people who live here,'' said Julie Pokela, a lesbian business
leader and former head of the Chamber of Commerce. ``It was more a
book about Tommy O'Connor than about Northampton.''
</P>
<P>
   Shake Kidder's book and it goes to the police.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor is a gentle, street-savvy cop whose humane dealings
with the town's underbelly form the spine of Kidder's book. Other
central figures include Alan Scheinman, a lawyer with an
obsessive-compulsive disorder; Laura Baumeister, a single mother on
welfare trying to get through Smith College; and Judge Michael
Ryan, a compassionate local judge.
</P>
<P>
   Defending his choice of characters, Kidder, who lives in
Williamsburg, explained, ``I didn't set out to do sociology or
political science. I tell the stories of people I found
interesting, people whose lives intersect with the town in
meaningful ways. I couldn't write about everything.''
</P>
<P>
   At Beyond Words bookstore, where Kidder's book was selling
``about 10 times faster than a normal best-seller,'' according to
co-owner Jeff Krauth, some readers feel slighted.
</P>
<P>
   Krauth noted that Kidder largely omits discussion of the town's
arts community (rated No. 1 in the United States in John Villani's
1998 book, ``The 100 Best Small Art Towns in America''); its
vibrant music scene; the unusually large number of professionals
devoted to holistic health and spiritual development; all the
mom-and-pop (or mom-and-mom) stores with distinctive personalities,
and more.
</P>
<P>
   But most surprising of all was the absence of a single openly
homosexual character in the book, although Kidder mentions unnamed
lesbians several times in passing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the biggest gap,'' said Sunia Hood, owner of Taxi's Dog
Bakery. ``The lesbians are hugely important in making Northampton
what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Although no formal count has been taken, Mayor Mary Ford
estimated that about 4,500 self-identified lesbians live in this
town of 29,000, or about one in every seven residents. Including
the surrounding area, she said the lesbian population probably
amounts to 10,000 _ an estimate accepted by several lesbian
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The influence of this female energy is visible everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Three city councilors, including its president, a local judge
and a former head of the Chamber of Commerce all are openly
lesbian. Staff at the local Unitarian church say about one-third of
its weddings are commitment ceremonies for lesbians, and the local
paper, The Daily Hampshire Gazette, regularly prints announcements
of these unions.
</P>
<P>
   Northampton has a 90-member Lesbian and Gay Business Guild, a
lesbian softball league with 15 teams, an annual lesbian parade, a
lesbian calendar of events, a bookstore that sells only books by
women, and dozens of lesbian support groups.
</P>
<P>
   A special business card offering 10 to 20 percent discounts for
lesbians and their supporters is in the offing. One phone card on
sale and advertisements in lesbian newsletters proudly proclaim
that this is ``Lesbianville, U.S.A.''
</P>
<P>
   What is most remarkable about the large lesbian presence, some
locals said, is how well it has been accepted politically,
economically and socially.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can pretty much walk the streets without being harrassed,''
said Aimee Ross, a self-described ``bearded lady'' with 27 rings
and other adornments piercing various parts of her anatomy.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Ford stressed that the fault lines in town don't break in
terms of sexual preference. ``The gay folks have never put forward
a single-issue agenda or tried to be the dominant group,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, she claimed, the typical ``we-they'' hostilities
that plague many other small towns hardly exist here.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he didn't write more about Northampton's lesbian
population, Kidder said that he didn't find anyone who was willing
to open up her life to him, although he added that he didn't try
hard to find someone. Also, he said, it ``seemed trite, or stupid,
to define someone in terms of their sexuality. I thought it wasn't
an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Some lesbians agreed, breathing a sigh of relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're tired of all the public focus on our sex lives,'' said
Robyn Camarata, a volunteer at a lesbian and gay gift shop called
Pride and Joy. ``We're strong enough on our own not to need every
book that comes along to mention us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the ultimate goal of the whole movement _ not to be an
issue,'' said Jane, co-owner of an all-women's bed-and-breakfast,
who asked that her last name not be used.
</P>
<P>
   But others said the way lesbians have melted into the town is so
unusual that it deserves serious literary attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are other gay enclaves, but there's no place I know
where the gay population is so integrated into the community,''
Pokela said.
</P>
<P>
   She attributed this to the conjunction of several developments
in the past 25 years: the presence of an open-minded population at
Smith and the four other colleges nearby; the growth of the gay
rights movement; deinstitutionalization of the state's mental
health wards, creating a range of human-service jobs; and the size
of Northampton, which discouraged segregation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The town is too small and the lesbian population is too big to
have ghettos,'' Pokela said.
</P>
<P>
   Mulling this over, Kidder concluded, ``If there's a fault in the
book, it's that I didn't convey clearly enough how remarkable it is
that Northampton is on the way to being a place where (being
homosexual) doesn't matter any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the moral of the story, said Mayor Ford, ``is that Tracy
should write more books. Or other people should write a book about
the lesbian community here.''
</P>
<P>
   But for now, at least, most of Kidder's readers said they are
willing to forgive him his omissions. In this town where
intellectual inquiry and free-spiritedness are celebrated, many
grant an artist the license to paint the portrait he sees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's his book. He gets to write about whatever interests
him,'' said Clare Higgins, the city council president, who is
openly gay.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much that is left out _ but that's the nature of
trying to capture what you can't really capture,'' said Carol
Edelstein, a poet and social worker.
</P>
<P>
   But what Kidder tried to do, he did tenderly and well, she and
others said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's writing in a warm and extremely humane, poetic way about
people for whom Northampton was a community before it became a hot
spot for artists and gays and people who like fancy restaurants,''
said Robert MacLachlan, a retired psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   Since the book appeared in bookstores in mid-April, it has
sparked discussion all over town about the kind of place
Northampton is, how it sees its identity.
</P>
<P>
   When Kidder appeared for a reading at the Broadside Bookshop,
450 people turned out to hear him. The conversations about ``Home
Town'' are lively but not irate, and no protests are expected by
those who feel overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about why lesbians aren't angry about being left out of
Kidder's book, Higgins pointed to the tolerant spirit that has made
Northampton what it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we all get along so well out here,'' she quipped.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ACTON, Mass. _ Small and boxy, the metronome that ticks away
atop the rebuilt Steinway in Bronika Kushkuley's living room does
immeasurably more than mark precise time for Haydn's ``E Minor
Sonata.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the critical clock of her young life, rhythmically
defining sharp segments of a tightly disciplined world.
</P>
<P>
   It signals when she must train as the acclaimed concert pianist
whose work already has carried her twice to Carnegie Hall. Its
silence means she can be just a kid _ a bright-eyed girl chasing
her chubby puppy across a sun-drenched lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Kushkuley is a prodigy, an 11-year-old performer who has cut a
self-titled CD, is featured on her own Web page, has performed
across Europe, and triumphed at international competitions from
Washington to Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Her gift is both a blessing and a challenge. It demands a
delicate balance to ensure that her music is nurtured but does not
climb to a crescendo that overwhelms other telling tones that echo
in any preteen's world.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you play the piano all day, I don't think that's a very
good idea,'' Kushkuley said last week, sitting beneath a cloudless
sky on the back steps of her parents' tri-level home here.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want your music to express this day, or the springtime,
or the trees and stuff, if you don't go outside sometimes, you
can't really play that way,'' she said, ``because you won't have
the feel of it.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when some parents are under assault for paying too
little attention to the details of their children's lives,
Kushkuley's parents say they are taking care to avoid an opposing
offense common in the homes of overachievers: paying too much
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Bronika left her elementary school to concentrate on the piano,
but her parents say they are seeking to provide their daughter with
a childhood with a premium on normalcy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not pushing,'' said Larissa Kushkuley, Bronika's mother.
``We're not trying to push her to make her a pianist at this age,
or to make her a concert pianist right now. We want her to get the
best education possible, which she needs. And then we'll just see
what she does.''
</P>
<P>
   What Bronika Kushkuley already has done is remarkable _
attaining a musical fluency that her Latvian-born parents scarcely
could have imagined when they immigrated to the United States in
1988, relieved to have escaped the oppression of their native land.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted to raise our children without Soviet
brainwashing,'' said Larissa Kushkuley, who like her husband
Alexander, is a computer programmer.
</P>
<P>
   Lovers of classical music but not musicians themselves, the
Kushkuleys settled first in Burlington in a small apartment they
found with the help of Temple Shalom Emeth. Later, they moved to a
modest home on a quiet street here, where the television is almost
always dark and the bookshelves bear trophies topped by musical
notes and the classics of Homer and Steinbeck and Swift.
</P>
<P>
   Then, five years ago, the parents of three made a simple
decision that would rearrange their lives: They enrolled their
children in piano lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really didn't think about great talent or anything,''
Larissa Kushkuley said.
</P>
<P>
   But after Bronika won the 1995 International Young Artists Piano
Competition in Washington, an after-school hobby intensified into a
full-time passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really gave us the idea that she really had to devote
more of her time to music,'' the pianist's mother said.
</P>
<P>
   That devotion has transported the Kushkuleys onto the unfamiliar
terrain of the talented _ a landscape where there are few clear
guideposts, many emotional land mines, and critics at every corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about this phenomenon that really bothers
most of us,'' said David Henry Feldman, a child development
professor at Tufts University who has studied child prodigies for
two decades. ``On the one hand we're admiring of it. On the other,
it gets to us. It makes us uneasy. It threatens us to some
degree.''
</P>
<P>
   Feldman said that common concerns about the loss of childhood or
the exploitation of youthful genius, while often on target, can
sometimes be misplaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``The talent changes everything,'' he said. ``We can't make them
into being just like us except for having this talent. It's just
not true. It's irresponsible. We celebrate diversity, but somehow
or another this kind of diversity we just can't grasp. It's just
different. It's like being in a different culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Winner, a psychology professor at Boston College and
author of ``Gifted Children: Myths and Realities,'' said unwilling
children pushed by their parents can emerge from the experience
sad, broken, and unable to pursue their talent into adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   ``But all the research shows that these kids are extremely
driven,'' Winner said. ``I call it the rage to master. You can't
tear them away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lay out all these cautions and dangers. But in some cases
it's not clear what should be done differently, because these kids
so desperately want to be spending their time focusing on their
domain of gift.''
</P>
<P>
   For up to five hours a day, that is precisely what Bronika
Kushkuley is deeply focused on, her bashful smile supplanted by a
serious resolve as her hands dance and fly across the keyboard, her
body swaying and leaning into the music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I think I have talent, but I don't think I'm great or
anything,'' she said. ``If you start thinking that you're a
prodigy, and you start saying, `Oh, I'm so good,' you'll start
playing worse.''
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't happened. Almost from the beginning, the music that
emerged when Bronika put her fingers to the piano keys was
something extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is unbelievably talented and deeply in love with the
music,'' said Julia Bernstein, an instructor at the New England
Conservatory, who has taught Kushkuley since she was 6 years old.
``I think she's one of the best of her age at least in the country,
but maybe the world, too. Other kids who have the same ability
don't have her discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   In the basement of Bernstein's home in Randolph, where Kushkuley
studies three times a week, student and teacher communicate with
each other in a lexicon of hand gestures, facial expressions,
clapping hands, snapping fingers, sung notes, and overt expressions
of displeasure or encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just loud, it's deep and serious,'' Bernstein tells
Kushkuley at one point. The student's worried visage melts into a
broad smile when Bernstein finally declares: ``Yes! Yes! Exactly!
Much better.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, over a cup of tea, the teacher explained: ``Everything I
blow to her, she just catches it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the solo recitals, far-flung competitions, CD recordings,
and international awards have not come without a price. The tempo
of the Kushkuley family's daily routine is kept by demands of piano
lessons for their three children, but most markedly by the rigors
of Bronika's training and a decision last year to shift her
education from the local elementary school to a home-schooling
regimen of mathematics, English, and social studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``She liked going to school,'' Larissa Kushkuley said. ``But she
really likes playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bronika's connection to her old school now comes from stories
told by her 13-year-old sister, Sophie, and her 10-year-old
brother, Jacob, who she greets with a smile from her post at the
piano bench one midafternoon recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have enough time to play the piano as much as I
should play,'' Bronika explained later as her new dog Constance, a
fuzzy chow chow, played friskily at her feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a choice: Either play the piano really well or go to
school. And I decided to play the piano. I don't really miss it,
but sometimes I feel lonely. I liked that there were a lot of kids.
Like right now, I don't have a very big choice of friends.''
</P>
<P>
   But she quickly noted that an old school pal is a frequent
visitor and that she has developed a pen-pal friendship with
Francesca, a violinist she met at a festival in Germany last year.
When the piano is quiet, she's upstairs playing with her American
Girls doll Samantha, running, swimming, reading, or writing stories
and poems _ available to visitors of her Web page.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are actually thinking that we are led by her because we
never envisioned that we would home-school one of our kids,'' said
Larissa Kushkuley. ``It just somehow grew up and we don't want to
put barriers in her world. We're trying to help out and see how the
situation develops.''
</P>
<P>
   Specialists say there is no true barometer to measure whether
young talent will survive the almost unavoidable emotional strains
of adolescence and blossom into acclaim in adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because a kid is a star at the age of 11 doesn't mean
that they're going to continue to go that route,'' said Joseph
Thayer, dean of the Colburn School of Performing Arts in Los
Angeles, a distinguished school for young performers. ``Some
prodigies make it; some lose interest and do other stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kushkuleys say they are preparing for either outcome, ready
to accept a career on stage or in front of a class as the teacher
of aspiring musicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all our kids we don't make any distinctions about who is
better, who is worse,'' Larissa Kushkuley said. ``We don't do that.
If (Bronika) doesn't do her chores, she'd get punished. We try to
keep it as normal as possible. But people do like to hear her in
concert.''
</P>
<P>
   And as Bronika Kushkuley polishes her material for a May 22
benefit concert at Brandeis University, where she will share the
stage with renowned cellist-conductor Mstislav Rostropovich, she
said it's the music, not the acclaim, that drives her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to go to some really major competitions and play my
best, but I really don't care if I win,'' the pianist said during a
break in practice sessions. ``It just doesn't matter. Because you
know (Russian-born pianist Vladimir) Horowitz? He didn't win a
single competition in his life. So, you see, it doesn't really
matter.''

STORM-WATCH ALL CLEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It really ought to have been a dark and stormy night when Bill
Feinberg of Sharon wrote, last December, to ask for help with a
disagreement over a weather word. In fact, it was still so pleasant
that the parka retailers and skiers were wringing their hands, but
Feinberg had bad weather on his mind nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   The source of his unease was storm as a verb _ a verb he thought
should properly take a direct object, as in ``They stormed the
castle.'' His wife, though, dissented: ``She uses it in the context
such as, `It's going to storm today,' '' he wrote. ``I think this
is not quite right.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, into each marriage some rain must fall. This time it's
falling on Bill, whose strictures on the use of storm have no
historical support: One of our most ancient and adaptable verbs,
storm has been used both literally and figuratively, either with or
without a direct object, to suit the purposes of each century's
rhetoric. ``The sea stormeth'' is normal in 1564, according the the
Oxford English Dictionary; three centuries later, Henry Ward
Beecher writes of ``men who are stormed like the ocean,'' meaning
roiled, disturbed. Even the military sense of the word doesn't
demand an object: Browning has one (``You know, we French stormed
Ratisbon''), but Tennyson does without (``All the Norman foot/Are
storming up the hill''). And any of us might storm out of the room
if a language dispute got too hot.
</P>
<P>
   There is one possible excuse, though, for thinking of it's
storming as not quite proper. That ``impersonal'' construction,
standard from the 16th through the 19th century, is now much less
common in England than in America; perhaps Feinberg is watching too
much British television for the good of his marriage. But debates
over storm should not be allowed to cloud the happiness of American
households.
</P>
<P>
   Much worse, both in life and in language, is tornado _ a word
our ancestors wrenched out of Spanish and revised into a form they
thought was more logical.
</P>
<P>
   When the word was borrowed for English, in the mid-1500s, it was
ternado _ a seafarer's name for a violent thunderstorm with winds
gusting from several directions. Ternado, the OED editors say, was
already probably a mistake _ a ``bad adaptation'' or a misspelling
_ of tronada, Spanish for thunderstorm. And once this twist had
been applied, the word looked as if it might be derived from
tornar, Spanish for ``to turn.'' Thus, sucked along by the false
etymology, the sense of whirling winds grew stronger as the
centuries passed.
</P>
<P>
   Today, in America, we think of tornadoes exclusively as the
funnel-cloud-forming storms that wreak such destruction in the
South and Midwest. We even emphasize their spiral form by calling
them twisters, a US coinage dating from the late 19th century. All
this from a mistranslation of an ordinary 16th-century
thunderstorm: Tornado's violent past makes the history of storm
seem smooth sailing indeed.

GORE'S WELL-LETTERED CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAMONI, Iowa -- In a flag-showing bus tour of a part of Iowa
that Democrats traditionally ignore _ the rural South _ Vice
President Al Gore delivered a semi-important speech about education
at a small college commencement here over the weekend. It gives us
a peek at his nascent presidential campaign that is stronger _
politically and conceptually _ than most Washington sharpies give
it credit for being.
</P>
<P>
   In the first of several orations that will sketch a post-Bill
Clinton America, Gore's speech to Graceland College exuded what
might be called continuity-plus.
</P>
<P>
   As he begins to blend substance with his politics, Gore is
anything but the George H. W. Bush of 1987 who mumbled ``kinder and
gentler'' as a code for something different than Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   He runs in unabashed pride for the Clinton-Gore record and makes
suggestions about the future that are natural extensions of Clinton
policy. Indeed, he has in part drawn on the brainpower of Secretary
Bill Riley's Education Department for his ideas.
</P>
<P>
   One of them involves saving for college, something that is very
hard for middle-income families to do under current tax laws.
</P>
<P>
   The idea Gore outlined here _ and it is a potential whopper _ is
that just as there is now a mechanism for employers to help
employees save for retirement, that same magic should help
accumulate money for job-training, additional education or a kid's
college tuition. With tax-free accumulation and other
encouragements, Gore proposes a major new savings instrument _ a
401(j).
</P>
<P>
   As an indication of how thoroughly work is done in Gore's world
_ possibly to the point of absurdity _ most people know that the
employer-employee retirement plan is called a 401(k). Logic would
indicate that a new wrinkle in the tax code for education savings
would get the next letter: (l).
</P>
<P>
   But Gore instead chose the letter ``j'' for his program.
</P>
<P>
   Now why would he do that? Since practically nothing is done in
this game anymore without a bunch of meetings and memos, it turns
out there is a reason: Because ``j'' and ``k'' rhyme, the Gore
reasoning was that using the ``j'' would make people think of the
popular retirement funds and thus make the new accounts more
attractive.
</P>
<P>
   To an ignorant generalist like me, every instinct says, ``Gimme
a break.''
</P>
<P>
   But upon reflection, it's hard not to imagine that Gore may have
a point even on this tiny detail, or worse that Clinton-Gore
pollster Mark Penn may have the research to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Details and vision clash on occasion in Gore's world. The fact
that he may be right on his details, however, shouldn't obscure the
fact that he doesn't always play the violin enough. What he talked
about in his speech would transform the family economics of
education, and yet if anything he undersold it.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was much more clear and expansive about the second element
of his proposal to expand savings incentives for education. This
would take savings programs now in more than 30 states and make the
system national.
</P>
<P>
   These programs allow families to begin putting money aside after
a child's birth that accumulates tax-free for use in-state. If the
rest of the states had incentives to join, the money saved would be
available for higher education in any participating state _ a major
change for the better.
</P>
<P>
   The buzz in Washington and New York may be concerns about Gore's
headquarters staff and impolitic expressions of worry by the
president and Mrs. Clinton. But all that junk was inaudible out
here, where Gore did major business with the region's Democratic
activists as his motorcade traced a line from well south of Des
Moines east to Burlington on the Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   In tow, significantly, was the area's increasingly safe
Democratic congressman from the conservative 3rd District, Len
Boswell, who decided to back Gore even before his good buddy,
Minority Leader Dick Gephardt from neighboring Missouri, decided
not to run.
</P>
<P>
   The well-attended tour got another boost from Iowa's first
Democratic governor in 30 years, Tom Vilsack, at whose
white-shingled home in Mt. Pleasant Gore paid a courtesy call. With
a large crowd outside on Main Street, the new and officially
neutral governor chose to be gushy, not reticent, in his praise,
claiming, ``We have been working off the playbook Al Gore
essentially developed.''
</P>
<P>
   And all this was happening out here on a weekend when Gore
operatives in Massachusetts sucker-punched an overeager, not-ready
Bill Bradley operation in a straw poll at the state party's
convention.
</P>
<P>
   This is a campaign that is likely to unfold on parallel tracks
for some time _ Gore on his, Bradley on his. And its shape cannot
be known until Bradley shows more of himself and his ideas than he
has.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore is no slouch in either the ideas or the political
mechanics departments. His advantage could not be more real.
</P>
<P>
   And it will get bigger if he focuses more on the forest of
continuity-plus and less on little trees like the letter ``j.''

HOW SUIT _ AND REASONABLE _ IT IS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's a suite idea for your next Orlando visit.
</P>
<P>
   Holiday Inns is opening its first all-suite hotel here in July.
While it's called the Holiday Inn Family Suites Resort Lake Buena
Vista, it has something for everyone, from business travelers to
romantics. Families, though, will love this place not only for its
value but for its features.
</P>
<P>
   Each suite offers three rooms plus a large, full bath. Families
will be attracted especially to the Kidsuites, which offer two
separate bedrooms and a parlor. One bedroom is designed for kids
with bunk beds and a pull-out bed plus a 20-inch TV, a VCR, a
Nintendo 64, and more. The other room, with a king-sized bed, is
for the adults. In addition the parlor area comes with a pullout
sofa, a 25-inch TV, a kitchenette with a microwave, a refrigerator,
a coffee maker, an iron, a safe, a rocking chair, a game table, and
more. If that's not enough, the suites come with a full breakfast
for every member of the family. And the best part is that prices
begin at $129 a night, with a special introductory rate of $119.
</P>
<P>
   Outside there's a large play area and pool, restaurants, and
shops, plus there's complimentary transportation to Disney World
just a mile away. There's also a Parents' Night Out program
allowing parents to take in some nightime fun (complimentary pagers
are provided to keep in touch with the young set).
</P>
<P>
   OK, so how do business people and romantics find happiness among
the kids? Easy. The 800-suite inn offers a separate area with three
other suite designs: SweetHeart, Cinemasuites, Fitness, and
Business. Similar in design to the family suites, these suites
replace the kids' room with a heart-shaped whirlpool tub, mood
lighting, and a 50-inch TV; or a separate theater room with a
60-inch TV and surround sound, along with dual rocker recliners.
Five suites will feature a workout room with a cycle and other
equipment plus a TV and VCR for workout tapes; and five suites will
offer a conference room with a work station and modem line.
</P>
<P>
   The resort also offers ``classic'' two-bedroom suites for
couples traveling together or older children, as well as
residential suites with full kitchens for those staying in the area
longer (some connect with Kidsuites for larger family gatherings).
</P>

Massachusetts town will celebrate its past as a major rail center
with a display of a state-of-the-art locomotive, along with
``speeder'' rail rides. Also on view will be railroad memorabilia
in the 1840 railroad station, a blacksmith demonstration, music,
food, and a reproduction of the 1893 Duryea auto, the first
commercially successful American car built in Springfield. Chester
was the birthplace of the abrasives industry and there will be
tours of the former facilities. Antiques, classic autos, and crafts
complete the 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. day.
</P>
<P>
   Also on May 22, Downsville, N.Y., will holds its first annual
Covered Bridge Festival. The day marks the reopening of the
Downsville Covered Bridge, the longest in New York. For
information, call 888-209-1543.
</P>
<P>
   On May 29, Old Sturbridge Village will hold a Muskets and

re-created early American militia day will be held in this classic
1830s New England village.
</P>
<P>
   . . . On June 19? That's the 31th annual San Francisco
Juneteenth Festival, also known as the National Freedom Day, the
oldest celebration of freedom from slavery by African Americans.
June 19, 1865, was the day that the message of freedom reached
black people in Texas. The day is now celebrated in many states.
San Francisco has expanded the celebration, which includes parades,
a carnival, a film festival, a rodeo, and more to three days June
18-June 20. For information, call 415-391-2001.

BAD MANNERS CALLING 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Just as a colleague and I finished a spirited
discussion about ``runaway entitlement'' in our culture, I opened
the newspaper to find an ad for one of the worst expressions of
this nasty phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   The ad, placed by a national telephone company, shows a young,
hip-looking man and woman sitting on a park bench. He stares
intently at the screen of a laptop computer; she blabs animatedly
into a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   A promotion for a contest that would award free cell phone and
Internet service, the ad said: ``It's not just about winning a year
of (the company's) communication. It's about feeling free to lose
yourself in conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   Just what the world needs: more cell phone users who feel free
to lose themselves in conversation. Already we don't have enough?
Men and women with booming, screeching voices? Making anyone within
earshot privy to their every thought? They are omnipresent.
</P>
<P>
   They wreck meals in restaurants. They make hotel, theater and
office building lobbies sound like the floor of the New York Stock
Exchange when the Dow is tumbling. They shout in department stores
and boutiques, on street corners and escalators, on the steps of
churches and from the next seat on a public bus.
</P>
<P>
   Never, never, do they talk softly or briefly. If this is not the
freedom to lose yourself in a conversation, I don't know what
freedom is.
</P>
<P>
   The phone blabbers are the opposite of inhibited; they are in
the throes of runaway entitlement.
</P>
<P>
   Runaway entitlement is not new to our culture; cell phones are
just the latest conduit. In the old days it was known as ``bad
manners.''
</P>
<P>
   This was back when nice people, if they had to, would carry a
candy wrapper or soda can from San Francisco to Pasadena instead of
drop it on the sidewalk. This was when you didn't get cussed or
honked at for slowing down to parallel park.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting one's turn _ whatever the circumstances _ wasn't even
considered good manners. It was simply standard civilized behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Every time I stand in line at the salad bar near my office, I
remember those years. A typical fast fresh-food establishment, the
eatery would never be mistaken for a place of genteel, leisurely
dining. Everybody in the joint is in some degree of hurry.
</P>
<P>
   But people in the throes of runaway entitlement are in the
biggest hurry of all.
</P>
<P>
   Like planes ready to launch from an aircraft carrier deck, they
rev their engines behind you, periodically nudging or bumping into
your elbow or hip. No matter your pace, it's not fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   Although I've yet to have a serving spoon actually pulled from
my hand, it's been close many times. As for someone reaching across
my outstretched hands for the sunflower seeds or bacon bits on down
the line, it's DE RIGUEUR.
</P>
<P>
   Do the bumps or reaches ever produce a ``pardon'' or ``excuse
me''? Need you ask?
</P>
<P>
   Then there are pedestrian crosswalks where runaway entitlement
is off the charts. Adult men and women _ mothers pushing their
precious cargo in baby strollers or holding the little tykes by the
hand _ arrogantly step off curbs without bothering to check
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Once in the crosswalk, they saunter as if checking out the goods
at a village bazaar.
</P>
<P>
   Often (especially when they jaywalk) they shoot hateful looks at
the driver of the car they have halted.
</P>
<P>
   Always, I think: What sort of an example are you setting for
your treasured little offspring? Always, the same answer comes
back:
</P>
<P>
   (Bleep) you. I'm entitled.
</P>
<P>

A SWEET CELEBRATION OF BASEBALL AND JAZZ 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS C. PALMER JR.

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ ``Negro'' is such an authentic word. Outdated
and freighted with ill connotations, it can be used only
deliberately. Yet everything about it is right for the Negro
Leagues Baseball Museum that opened here in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
   As you enter the museum, without even realizing it, you must get
up on your toes to peer over a high wall to glimpse a majestic,
still, almost lifesize baseball infield, with statues of players in
place. You are denied even visual participation _ as black
Americans were denied the opportunity to join white Americans in
the all-American game until 1947.
</P>
<P>
   The authenticity of that museum, and of the Jazz Museum that
shares a new, $26 million publicly financed cultural center at 18th
and Vine, is in the richness of its exhibits, but as well in the
historical context that colors these facilities throughout.
</P>
<P>
   During segregation, this area was the heart of Kansas City's
minority community,
</P>
<P>
   Architects and designers and musicians and sports specialists
all participated in the creation of The Museums at 18th and Vine,
fulfilling a vision of the city's current and first black mayor,
Emanuel Cleaver. But the thick strain of history, of the
prohibitions and separations that today are being overcome but that
were essential to the creation of both jazz and to decades of
all-black baseball, make a visitor's experience not just
informative, not just fun, but almost essential.
</P>
<P>
   These two museums, linked by a small but well-selected exhibit
including a film of the history of the black community in the
Kansas City area, nearly remained only a dream. There was intense
opposition from some whites, and there was division within the
black population about what shape that project ``over there'' on
the east side of town should take.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Whiting, a former spokeswoman for Mayor Cleaver who until
recently handled public affairs for the quasi-government agency
that houses the museums, said even some in the mayor's own
political circle doubted. ``Don't be talking to me about 18th and
Vine,'' Whiting said she was told, only a few years ago. ``I've
been hearing it for years. It's never going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz Museum opened in September 1997 and last year
celebrated its anniversary, with Harry Belafonte, Danny Glover, Ray
Charles, George Benson, and others performing at the historic Gem
Theater nearby. Once Kansas City's only black movie house, it has
been turned into a 500-seat performing arts center as part of the
revitalization of the larger neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The Negro Leagues Baseball Museum opened a couple of months
later. Together, though they have seen a slower than predicted
start in numbers of visitors, the two museums present moving and
fascinating profiles of two vitally important pieces of cultural
black history, both national and locally.
</P>
<P>
   Jazz may not have been born in Kansas City, but it spent some
heavy adolescent years there, generating a Kansas City,
swing-style, big-bandish sound, like that extensively played in
Robert Altman's movie ``Kansas City.'' The movie was short on plot,
but the music was the real thing, and some of the sets and building
facades used in the production are still part of the attraction
here, half a block from the Jazz Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Negro Leagues Baseball was born in Kansas City, following years
of de facto segregated baseball that began after the Civil War. The
Negro National League originated in 1920 on a well-known local
street called The Paseo, a couple of blocks from the dignified
museum where it is now remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Black baseball grew to six leagues _ from New York to Houston,
from Milwaukee to Jacksonville _ in 30 cities, and lasted until
1960, a dozen years after Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier
with the Brooklyn Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never felt that I wasn't making the money the white players
made, or I wasn't as famous,'' Gene Benson of the Philadelphia
Stars once said. ``I just wanted to play baseball. I loved the
game. I'd have played for $100 a year, for a dollar. I'd have
played for nothing just to get out there on that grass, that dirt,
and play baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Room
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's a rare jazz club in which you can't smoke. But that's the
rule at the Blue Room, by day a step-back-in-time feature of the
Jazz Museum, with display cases and a photo wall of jazz greats,
and by night a working jazz club.
</P>
<P>
   The original Blue Room was about a block away, in the Street
Hotel, where black folks stayed, not being welcome at the
Muehlebach Hotel or other fancy temporary residences in the city.
This reborn Blue Room is owned by the 18th &AMP; Vine Authority, a
quasi-independent city agency, so city rules are in effect.
Nightclub smoke would damage the artifacts too.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Room has done something no museum or any amount of
wishful thinking by city officials could do. It's brought people
back to this abandoned area at night. At a regular ``Blue Monday
Jam,'' Gerald Dunn played saxophone and hosted a session with a
four-piece house band, and locals who later on in the evening
summoned the courage to get up and play.
</P>
<P>
   The jazz is not improvisional or cutting-edge. It is
intentionally kept in the traditional, big-band vein that Kansas
City was known for. ``It's one of the things we're trying to keep
alive, but it's sprinkled with contemporary jazz,'' said Andre
Tyler, a former Stanford University and Tampa Bay Buccaneers
football player who manages the room. He married a woman from
Kansas City and now is here operating the club with Dave Winslow, a
local restaurant owner experienced in jazz and dinner clubs.
</P>
<P>
   On a wall among scores of portraits of those who played Kansas
City _ including Bessie Smith, Fats Waller, Art Tatum, Thelonious
Monk, John Coltrane, Dave Brubeck, Wes Montgomery, and Charles
Mingus _ is a stab at the definition of Kansas City Swing.
``Rhythm, drive and walking bass, combined with blues-based
instrumental riffs.'' It was ``cultivated by Bennie Moten and
Walter Page, popularized nationwide by Count Basie.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Room opened on Sept. 6, 1997, and in some ways it is
the most successful of the various pieces of revitalization going
on at 18th and Vine. There is music four nights a week, and on
Friday and Saturdays the 150-seat club routinely fills up, Tyler
said. About 40 people came on a Monday night, no cover charge. They
heard Lester Warner sing ``I Remember April,'' and a sit-in drummer
named Michael do ``Have You Met Miss Jones?'' and a talented
high-school senior named Logan Richards, who was soon heading off
to the University of North Texas to study music next year, play a
very professional sax.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got over my nerves in the seventh grade,'' said Richards.
But most who step up on stage still haven't. Dunn, who books the
club as well as emcees, said Michael had ``been waiting since the
first set, if you can believe it. He's been twidling this thumbs
and rubbing his sticks.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz Museum
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Amid a neglected area that is the epitome of urban decay
populated disproportionately by black America stands a crisp, solid
new two-story building, heavy with neon and other eye-catching
artist's touches. Through a spacious oval lobby, past a souvenir
shop with delectable but expensive knicknacks, is the first museum
in America devoted to a wholly American form of music.
</P>
<P>
   A 15-minute movie almost succeeds at the impossible: defining
jazz. ``I don't have any special magic,'' says pianist Shirley
Horn. ``I sit there and play what I feel. Maybe that's a special
magic. I'm always trying to paint a picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, you meet a pleasurable multi-sensory experience.
Visually _ in colors, in shapes, in textures, in volume _ the Jazz
Museum the equivalent of the music it displays. There is something
of a ``Cabinet of Dr. Calgari'' effect in the angular shapes of the
exhibits, the panels. How very appropriate they are doesn't become
clear until near the end, when visitors pass a wall of the great
album covers of the jazz age. Miles Davis' ``Sketches of Spain'' on
Columbia Records, 1960; ``Moanin' Low,'' Torch Songs by Lena Horne
on Victor Records; ``Blossom Dearie'' on Verve.
</P>
<P>
   And the designers responsible for that distinctive jazzy look
that began in the 1940s and influenced Andy Warhol and others are
notable for their unfamiliar names: Robert Berenson's 1958 ``East
Coasting'' for Charles Mingus on Mercury; Herman Leonard's ``Dizzy
in Greece'' in 1957 for Dizzy Gillespie on Verve; David Stone
Martin's more than 250 covers, including ``The Lionel Hampton
Quartet'' in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Were it only for the objects _ the albums; the plastic saxophone
that Kansas City native Charlie ``Yardbird'' Parker used in ``The
Concert,'' May 1953 at Toronto's Massey Hall; or Ella Fitzgerald's
dress _ a visitor could do as with any other museum and choose a
fast or slow pace. Not here. Forget about rushing on as you
approach a music station, a loose-leaf set of plastic pages on a
small lectern, where you can put on headphones and choose No. 8,
Bix Biederbecke with Frankie Trumbauer and His Orchestra, doing
``Singin' the Blues ('Til My Daddy Comes Home)'' from 1927.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz Museum's central feature is its presentation of the
music. It is reverently quiet as a visitor walks through this
place, until one of the many sets of headphones is clasped on.
</P>
<P>
   Past the interactive displays devoted to each of the musical
instruments vital to jazz, there is a stop that would challenge
even many who are schooled in jazz. At ``In the Mix,'' you play the
sound engineer, literally remixing Charles Mingus' ``Fables of
Faubus'' and playing it back. Set the microphone levels on eight
instruments, from snare drum to trombone, then control the
reverberation and sound direction.
</P>
<P>
   Or choose a version mixed by a professional engineer and just
watch the lights on the mixing board change, indicating the
complexity of shaping just one song at a recording session.

 KANSAS CITY, Mo.: ... recording session.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With special spaces devoted to Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong,
and Ella Fitzgerald, as well as to jazz's component parts _
harmony, rhythm, melody, and ``thinking in jazz'' _ the museum tour
ends with the new and old together. A jazz DISCovery section
features computers for further research, and video display
terminals reflect the colorful lights of neon signs rescued from
the neighborhood in recent decades: Top Hat Grill, Pink Door
Cocktail Lounge, Fox's Tap Room, The Other Room, Elinora's Cafe,
and, of course, the Street Hotel's Blue Room.
</P>
<P>
   A door opens into the Blue Room, which is quiet by day. It holds
silent tributes to Bennie Moten's Kansas City Orchestra, Bill
``Count'' Basie, the Blue Devils of Oklahoma City and other
``territory bands,'' Kansas City swing, jook joints, bebop, and a
wall of photos of every known and unknown black musician that
played the area from the 1920s on.

</P>
<P>
   Negro Leagues Baseball Museum
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Formally, the segregated alternative leagues lasted from 1920 to
1960. They represented almost a nation within a nation. The Negro
National League, the Eastern Colored League _ and the East-West
League, which had the audicity not to employ a word denoting
separation in its name _ were among six black leagues. They
developed some of baseball's great players, black or white.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, Willie Mays, Satchel Paige, Hank Aaron, Roy
Campanella, Ernie Banks. They rode and slept on buses, touring
during the season. They stayed in hotel rooms that cramped even a
single bed _ one of them is recreated in the museum. The crude
gloves and uniforms and shoes are on display here, among the black
and white photographs of the stars, and of the fans that dressed up
even in the summer heat and came out to cheer them.
</P>
<P>
   This being Kansas City, the Monarchs are featured; they won the
Series in '24 and again in '42. But many other teams are recalled
with a reproduction of their uniforms, hanging in an exhibit of a
typically cramped locker room of the day. Andrew ``Rube'' Foster, a
star pitcher, manager, and owner, was the leagues' most important
figure, pulling the teams together and administering the leagues
through even tough times. One league died in the Depression, but
the golden years followed, up through 1939 when a pastime took
minds off hard times and an impending war.
</P>
<P>
   The leagues are credited with initiating night baseball.
</P>
<P>
   A year after the color line was broken _ a long overdue
development that was nevertheless met with a few bittersweet
feelings, given that it meant the end of the leagues themselves _
President Harry Truman ended segregation in the Armed Forces. Today
baseball, the military _ and of course jazz _ are among the least
racially divided corners of American life.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Gem Theater
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This 1912 movie theater, its facade and neon marquee salvaged as
perhaps the most familiar artifact on the block of the segregated
age, re-opened in August of 1997, a few days before the Jazz Museum
and two months before the Negro Leagues Museum. It was gutted and
expanded and is now the Gem Theater Cultural and Performing Arts
Center, seating 500.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's anniversary performances were held at the Gem and in
the streets of the districts outside. Tagged ``Livin' on the
Vine,'' the anniversary included an event celebrating the 99th
birthday anniversary of Duke Ellington. Along with local perfomers
and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference Gospel Choir,
there were appearances by the Manhattan Transfer, James Ingram,
Patti Austin and the George Duke Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Around the corner from the Gem is the Mutual Musicians
Foundation, a truly unassuming building that not only housed the
Local 627 musicians' union headquarters but that still swings into
the early hours, after the Blue Room and another small jazz joint
in the neighborhood, the Mardi Gras, have closed their doors.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounding any celebration, or any tourist group, in Kansas
City is lots of Kansas City barbeque. The most famous (though not
the best) of the barbeque restaurants, Arthur Bryant's, is a short
distance from 18th and Vine.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The District
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The municipal investment of $26 million isn't made easily, or
without the hope and expectation that it is a magnet for economic
development that will reclaim a larger and larger part of a revered
but lost part of the city. The 18th and Vine Authority runs the
Gem, the Jazz Museum and Blue Room, and a visitors center. The
Negro Leagues Museum is in space leased to it by the authority and
is operated by a separate nonprofit corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Whiting, the former aide to Mayor Cleaver, said that about $2
million of the current annual operating budget is public money, a
portion that is to be reduced as attendance grows.
</P>
<P>
   The Black Archives of Mid-America _ founded by local
activist-historian Horace Peterson, who is credited with the idea
of rebuilding the area _ is relocating into a historic parks and
recreation building nearby. But it is the business interest that
creates real excitement among the area's promotors. Sprint, with
headquarters in the Kansas City area, has opened a 60-person,
welfare-to-work office across from the Blue Room. A restaurant
called Sylvia's is scheduled to open this year. And, though the
city owns most of the buildings in a six-square-block area, efforts
are being made on many fronts to get people back to 18th and Vine.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Cleaver, then a city councilman, pushed the idea of
using a half-cent sales tax as backing for bonds to build the
museums. ``It was a controversial idea,'' said Whiting, the first
real expenditure of money in an area of the city many had written
off. Eight years later, they opened.
</P>
<P>
   Another public authority, the Jazz District Redevelopment Corp.,
is working to help the area grow, advised by a large local
developer. The area is one of the federal government's so-called
enhanced-enterprise communities and has received or been promised
$14 million in loans and grants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the people who have a dream of a business need some
help,'' said Whiting. A desserts chef at a large hotel wanted to
open a pastry shop in the district, ``to make stuff that's too
pretty to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Whiting said 200 proposals have been made to the redevelopment
corporation. ``For the district to survive, we need the museums as
the heart of it,'' Whiting said, but also, ``We need housing,
business, and retail.'' Mixed-income housing nearby includes the
Count Basie Courts.
</P>
<P>
   The area also needs a racially mixed population of visitors to
be successful, and _ while the overall numbers haven't met
expectations _ that diversity has come, despite a strong fear among
many in Kansas City's white suburbs that 18th and Vine is a place
best avoided.
</P>
<P>
   A distinct but unobtrusive police presence, many officers in
plain clothes at night or on bicycles during the day, makes the
area safer than some of its mostly white nightclub districts.
``Visitors are 70 percent white _ about like the population,''
Whiting said last summer. Lately, as the word has spread, black
visitors have increased, and more like 60-40.
</P>
<P>
   If the mix is right, the numbers are nevertheless disappointing
to some. A 1992 study projected that 76,000 people would visit the
Jazz Museum in the first year. Only about 35,000 did, and a delayed
opening of the Negro Leagues Museum is suspected of depressing
turnout. But officials say more 350,000 have come to the district
for one event or another in the last year, and they're encouraged
by paid admissions now running at 14,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   than 150,000 attended various performances in the district, and
they're encouraged by increasing attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Some criticism continues. The director of the Black Chamber of
Commerce of Greater Kansas City in September chastized city
officials for having a ``build it and they will come'' attitude
unsupported by a solid business plan.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kansas City Star has reported that a powerful team of
black architects and engineers with HNTB Architects to develop the
Jazz District. Last summer, business and government officials
promised $70 million to finance housing and new business in the
newly enlivened area.
</P>
<P>
   Guiding visitors to the area across the 18th Street, from the
museums to the Gem Theater, is a novel, broad crosswalk. It is
marked off with customary white paint, but the lines are thick and
wavy, and even wanderers who are not so musically inclined will
recognize it as a suggestion of a musical scale _ a touch not corny
but just right for a project whose objective is to get people
involved in the Jazz Age.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Bouchard, a senior designer at Amaze Design Inc. of
Boston, who worked on the Jazz Museum project, said he didn't know
whose idea it was to extend the musical theme onto the pavement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been trying to figure out who did that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was Rowena Stewart, executive director of the 18th
and Vine Authority. Stewart, a former Boston resident who worked
for the Harriet Tubman House in the early 1960s, said she wanted a
connection between the Negro Leagues and Jazz museums, on the north
side of 18th Street, and the Gem, on the south side. ``It couldn't
just sit over there by itself,'' said Stewart. ``We wanted to
create a kind of rhythm between the two buildings.''
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Admit it, fellows, we'd all like to be James Bond, that suave
and sexy spy in the novels and movies. Well now you can be Bond . .
. for a little while anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The Wyndham El San Juan Hotel &AMP; Casino is ofering a four-day,
three-night package for two that will allow you to live out your
Bondian fantasies. And you don't even need a white dinner jacket _
you can rent one for $60 for the three nights. Here's what the
package includes:
</P>
<P>
   --A limousine waiting for you at the airport with the chauffeur
holding a sign for ``James Bond.''
</P>
<P>
   --Deluxe accommodations for two. Room service will promptly
deliver a special pen that, when opened, contains secret tools. The
deliverer's name tag will read ``Q.''
</P>
<P>
   --A call from the concierge, who will reveal her identity as
``Moneypenny'' and offer to make any reservations. Restaurant staff
will welcome you as ``Mr. Bond'' and accept checks signed ``007.''
</P>
<P>
   --Several complimentary items and services, including two ``From
Russia With Love'' martinis, VIP treatment at the hotel's Babylon
Night Club and Disco, two half-hour massages, and unlimited use of
a penthouse fitness center.
</P>
<P>
   --Turndown service that on the first night includes a bottle of
champagne and chocolate-covered strawberries, on the second night
brandy, chocolate cigars, and exclusive El San Juan cigars, and on
the final night two James Bond personalized bathrobes and sauterne
wine. And nightly there will be casino chips that cleverly conceal
chocolate.
</P>

Nov. 22, the rate for the total package $1,137 plus taxes and tips.
If you want to upgrade to the Presidential Suite of beachfront
Monarch Suite, the price jumps to $8,007. From Nov. 23 through

Hungry Jack's, in its place. . . . Burger King opened its first
four company-owned restaurants (under the Burger King name) in
Sydney, New South Wales . . . in December 1997.'' So there.

   Meanwhile, Peter Clark of Georgetown, Mass., who spent five
weeks in Sydney on an educational exchange program, forwards these
fascinating facts:
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you know that in New Zealand (at least in Christchurch),
McDonald's puts slices of kiwi fruit on their Big Mac's?
</P>
<P>
   ``Also . . . in the United States the Subaru Outback automobile
is advertised with an `Australian' theme that uses the Crocodile
Dundee actor and scenes from the Australian outback. . . . The
identical automobile in Australia is called the Subaru Liberty and
is advertised with an `American' theme with scenes of the Grand
Canyon in the background.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of the Grand Canyon, a reader takes issue with a
recent statement, gleaned from a Reader's Digest publication, that
said Idaho's Hell's Canyon surpasses the Grand Canyon's deepest
drop of 5,700 feet by 2,200 feet. Writes Peter Huston of Sudbury,
Mass.: ``The 1976 edition of the World Book Encyclopedia claims the
Grand Canyon drops from about 9,000 feet above sea level (at North
Rim) to about 1,850 feet above at the river's edge _ 7,150 feet
total, or virtually the same!'' To paraphrase a president, we
suspect the differences may stem from what the definition of
``drop'' is.

   While in Naples, Fla., Marilyn Vecchio of Canton, Mass. spotted
an ad in a tourist magazine for ``live Main lobsters.'' She
suspects they meant ``Maine,'' but the main thing is that Maine
lobsters are mainly delicious no matter where they're eaten.

RULING MEXICAN PARTY OPTS FOR OPEN PRIMARY IN 2000 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Mexico's ruling party broke with 70 years of
tradition Monday by deciding that its presidential candidate for
2000 would be chosen in an open primary election.
</P>
<P>
   The Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which, since its
founding in 1929, has controlled Mexico, traditionally has had as
its candidate the personal choice of the incumbent president. But
Mexico's current president, Ernesto Zedillo, has repeatedly pledged
to end the so-called ``dedazo''in favor of a more democratic
process. In addition, growing competition from opposition parties
has put greater pressure on the PRI to adopt reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``From now on, no one can say that the president has chosen the
candidate,'' PRI President Jose Antonio Gonzalez said in a speech
to the 300 party officials who attended Monday's marathon session.
``We will choose our own candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rules, all interested candidates must register by
the end of June. Candidates who currently hold public office must
resign by June 15.
</P>
<P>
   The primary campaign season would run from Aug. 1 to Nov. 3. The
PRI will not provide any funds during the primary but will impose a
spending limit, which remains to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate would be selected by a vote among all registered
voters in early November. The winner would be the candidate who
takes the largest number of the country's 300 congressional
districts.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts predicted a more open process could attract a
larger pool of candidates. Already, there are at least three
declared candidates: former Puebla Governor Manuel Bartlett,
Tabasco Governor Roberto Madrazo and former PRI president Humberto
Roque.
</P>
<P>
   Other contenders could include Interior Secretary Francisco
Labastida Ochoa, considered by many to be Zedillo's favorite, and
Veracruz Governor Miguel Aleman, son of a former president.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's decision by the PRI was a surprise to some observers
who expected the party to agree to hold a secret vote only among
its members.
</P>
<P>
   Now the party appears ready to expand a successful experiment it
tried during last year's governor's race in the border state of
Chihuahua. There, for the first time, the PRI held an open primary
to pick its candidate rather than letting party bosses decide.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI went on to win the seat, taking away an office that for
nearly a decade had belonged to the conservative opposition
National Action Party, or PAN.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are seeing here is an extraordinary development to a
more open democracy in the PRI and for Mexico,'' said Arturo Nunez,
the head of the PRI's congressional delegation.
</P>
<P>
   None of the opposition parties has selected its candidate yet.
The two leading opposition candidates are Mexico City Mayor
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, of the leftist Party of the Democratic
Revolution, and Guanajuato Governor Vicente Fox, of the PAN. Both
of them have outpolled all potential PRI candidates in recent
surveys.

   KOSOVO-CLINTON _ WASHINGTON _ It was supposed to last three
days. Two months (EDs: Wednesday marks two months since NATO
bombing began March 24) into NATO's air war against Yugoslavia,
however, managing the campaign, the diplomacy aimed at ending it
and the unintended consequences of prolonged bombing has become a
huge and unexpected job for the White House. President Clinton has
emerged as a surprisingly engaged commander in chief, a quick
study, Pentagon officials say, who asks the right questions and
displays the correct instincts on an evolving operation, even as
he's stood fast on the mission's goals. (Deans, Cox News Service)

   MEXICO-POLITICS _ NUEVO LAREDO, Tamaulipas, Mexico _ The new
mayor opened a door in the corner of his office and climbed down
the secret spiral staircase that let him avoid the throng of people
constantly jockeying for a moment of his time. ``My escape route,''
Mayor Horacio Garza Garza explained as he edged down the steep
stairs to the street. He may need it. With his new get-tough
campaign against public corruption and drug trafficking in this
rapidly growing border city, Garza is quickly making enemies among
a police force that has become notorious for harboring officers who
participated in more crimes than they stopped.(Harmon, Austin

   ISRAEL-SHAS-0519 _JERUSALEM, Israel _ A day after the euphoria
of his election landslide, Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak faces a
daunting dilemma as he tries to form a coalition government? How to
deal with the biggest winner in the Israeli Parliament: the
controversial, ultra-religious Shas Party? The dilemma frames the
cultural war in Israel. The bribery conviction of the Shas Party
leader Areyeh Deri seemed to only empower this anti-establishment
movement, which nearly doubled its share of the Knesset in the
election. Developing.

   FLORIDA-PRIMARY _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Florida was supposed
to become part of a mega-state primary next year that would force

nomination for president. Instead, Florida is likely to have the

   EVERGLADES-LIFE _ THE EVERGLADES, Fla. _ In the central
Everglades, reminders of fire and death linger like the sulfur
smell in the breeze. But so do signs of new life. Saw grass shoots,
an almost fluorescent green, sprout 8 inches above the soil. Leaves
fan out from the base of the dead trunks. And under the ash, the
peat is moist. That means hope for recovery from the wildfires of
the past month, which swept across 170,000 acres of state-owned
Everglades marsh in northwest Broward County. (King, Palm Beach

   office excludes candidates who don't have money, effectively
functioning as a type of poll tax for would-be officeholders. A
lower court judge in Atlanta has ruled to dismiss the lawsuit. The
case centers on a claim filed by John White, a former state
representative from Albany who lost a primary bid for state Senate
in 1996 against incumbent Mark Taylor. Taylor outspent White
$270,000 to $16,000. (Rankin, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

Automobile, Its Enemies and the Politics of Mobility'' (Brookings

ridesharing mandate and a bus that may or may not arrive on time,
or a rail station that's a half-mile away from where you want to go
on a rainy day,'' Dunn said in a telephone interview. (Ledford,

   Food and dining stories from The N.Y. Times News Service for
Wednesday, May 19:
</P>
<P>
   WINE-BROKERS (Undated) _ On a recent trip to the Napa Valley,
when the vineyards were ablaze with carpets of yellow mustard
flowers, my friend was hoping to purchase a case of wine she had
been unable to find in New York. She thought it would take no more
than a phone call. Instead, it turned into a 90-minute odyssey that
required her to drive to the vineyard, pay for the wine, have the
case loaded into her car and then transport it to a shipping
service suggested by the winery. Welcome to the wacky world of the
50 different sets of state regulations governing interstate
shipment of wine. By Marian Burros.
</P>
<P>
   WINE-CONGRESS (Washington) _ Congress starts to crack down even
more on wine sales between states. By R.W. Apple Jr.
</P>
<P>
   WINE-TALK (Undated) _ The weekly wine column: Spanish wines that
aren't Rioja. By Frank J. Prial.
</P>
<P>
   With map.
</P>
<P>
   WINE-TASTINGS (Undated) _ A capsule wine review.
</P>
<P>
   PAPILLOTE (Undated) _ The cooking method known as en papillote _
after the parchment paper that encloses the food in an envelope _
has held its own through any number of culinary fashions. It was
especially favored in the days when haute cuisine was more
ceremonious than it is now, allowing the server to open the package
at the table in a show of erupting aromatic steam. Now, it still
maintains its place, mostly in restaurants, thanks to what is
perhaps a purer, more esthetic reason: a dish cooked in this way is
intensely yet harmoniously flavored. By Amanda Hesser.
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   With 3 recipes.
</P>
<P>

with olives. By Mark Bittman.

FOUR NEW STEERS TRYING TO HORN IN ON HERD ACT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINSCOTT RANCH, Texas _ Chocolate Chip and Carrot Top, two
massive longhorn steers who led the 1995 Great American Cattle
Drive from Fort Worth to Miles City, Mont., are vying for a place
in the Fort Worth Herd to be introduced June 12 at the city's
sesquicentennial celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Four new steers arrived at the Winscott Ranch southwest of Fort
Worth on Friday. Chocolate Chip and Carrot Top were shipped from
Sallisaw, Okla., along with two other steers, one of which also
carries the Circle 95 brand from the Great American Cattle Drive.

   ``I assume it was on the drive, too, but we just don't have any
information on it,'' said Dennis Merrell, trail boss for the
15-head Fort Worth Herd. ``We do know that Chocolate Chip and
Carrot Top took turns as the lead steer on that cattle drive.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Jones, manager of the Fort Worth Herd, said the four
steers came from Richard Howe of Yorktown, Ind. Howe purchased the
animals after the 1995 cattle drive to Miles City.
</P>
<P>
   The newcomers have joined 16 other steers on the Winscott Ranch,
though on Monday morning the newly arrived four were off to
themselves several hundred yards from the other cattle.
</P>
<P>
   The Winscott, owned by Ed Bass of the billionaire Bass family,
is the temporary home for the herd.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take a little time to get them used to one another; we
don't want to push them,'' Merrell said. ``We're going to get the
best 15 out of this herd, and the rest will go back to their
homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrell said there is already an ``A-team'' among the steers _
five that have done everything asked of them. Included in that
group are the two other Circle 95 veterans, Ned and Curley _
donated to the city by Bob and Mary Mike McKenzie of Aledo.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are absolutely great,'' Merrell said of the
top-performing steers. ``I feel like I can count on them in any
situation. The longer we're around them, the better we like them.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrell is hoping that the new additions will have the same
disposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take disposition over looks any day of the week,'' he
said. ``I've got to.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrell said he and his crew have been working the herd
constantly to get it accustomed to the kinds of noises and
distractions the steers are likely to encounter on the June 12
drive from downtown Fort Worth to their permanent home in the
Stockyards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had the Fort Worth Mounted Patrol come out and help
us,'' Merrell said. ``They've used blank guns, flares, and sirens.
I've driven around the steers in a pickup with a boom-box
blaring.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrell said the steers have been driven over white tarps and
under a line with newspapers and tarps hanging from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting to know them pretty well,'' he said. ``We really
don't want to get into naming them all, but it seems like we can't
help it. We've got Viejo and Boss, Blue and Lumpy. Tres Zero is our
steer that never met a photographer he didn't like. I'll swear if
the photographer tells him to move a little to the left, he'll do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the herd program is to illustrate the significance
of the cattle industry in Fort Worth's 150-year history. Cowhands
will drive part of the herd through the Stockyards to the Trinity
River each day, beginning June 14. Part of the herd will remain in
pens for display.

<P>
   HAWK BASE, Albania _ From out of the shrouded world of U.S. Army
special operations has come a secret weapon against the dreaded
mudholes of Albania: ``the Mule.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bringing in the Mule is the best thing the Army has done out
here,'' said Mule driver Sgt. Carson Morris, 27, of Freehold, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants one,'' says Lt. Col. Carole Valenti, the chief
logistical officer of Task Force Hawk. ``We intend to take them
back to Germany with us and they will be issued to all aviation
units there.''
</P>
<P>
   A well-known fixture on many American farms, the Mule looks like
a cross between a small golf cart and a Jeep. Its two-cycle engine
allows it to stealthily navigate boardwalks, gravel roads and
mudholes, alike, carrying up to four people and towing up to 1,200
pounds behind.
</P>
<P>
   In early April, when the Army landed at Rinas Air Field here and
began setting up an Apache helicopter base in often knee-deep mud,
Task Force Hawk commanders realized that the lumbering Humvees of
Gulf War fame were making the mudholes worse.
</P>
<P>
   Rumor has it that Brig. Gen. Dick Cody -- a legend among the
5,000 troops here for flying Apaches during the Gulf War --
suggested bringing in the Mules. Cody, who after the Gulf War, took
command of the secretive 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment
at Fort Campbell, Ky., introduced the Mules there to silently
transport his pilots and maintenance crews to their helipads.
</P>
<P>
   At about $16,000 each (off the shelf), the Army hastily procured
about 20 of the firecracker red Mules from the Kawasaki Motor Co.
They began arriving aboard C-17s on April 27.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Apache mechanics can be seen zipping down the flightline
without having to lug their 60-pound tool boxes. Apache and
Blackhawk pilots scoot on Mules to their helicopters without having
to slog through the mud or dust carrying flight gear. Mules are
also used to haul the mail, run errands and -- when nobody is
looking -- to take a quick run to the Post Exchange, or PX.
</P>
<P>
   In five weeks in Albania, not a single Mule has flipped over or
gotten stuck, said Valenti. ``We've had two flat tires and we've
had to replace a couple of headlights,'' she said. ``Other than
that, we haven't had any problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, except for a few small cases of ``Mule envy.'' It seems
that so far, only the helicopter units and the medical evacuation
crews have been allowed to use four-wheel utility vehicles --
leaving the infantry and artillery troops ``Mule-less.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the temptation of some soldiers -- who find
the little 4x4's ``neat'' -- to zip around this makeshift base at
unsafe speeds.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Valenti has issued a warning: Anyone caught
speeding in a Mule better get their whole unit used to walking.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The only way to reconcile two terribly contradictory perceptions
about Mexico's current and future prospects circulating today is to
understand how deeply the country has been divided by the process
of change over the past decade and a half.
</P>
<P>
   The cleavages sundering Mexico have created not only two
countries, but two increasingly alienated societies.
</P>
<P>
   A booming export sector, concentrated in and looking to the
north, has taken off. It is competitive, efficient, dynamic and
outward-looking. Its inputs, credit, output and standards are all
U.S.-based.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of Mexico _ where more than 80 percent of the nation's
100 million inhabitants live and work _ finds itself sinking into
political fragmentation, economic stagnation and social
dissolution.
</P>
<P>
   The images and assessments arising from these two situations are
both accurate: The aggregate economic numbers, heavily influenced
by the export sector, are improving constantly; the pessimism and
chaos pervading the rest of the country reflect the growing
intractability of Mexico's underlying problems.
</P>
<P>
   The most characteristic and worrisome among them is that it is
virtually impossible for the country to agree on anything. For
decades _ if not for centuries _ Mexico lived under a regime of
consensus: mostly imposed through authoritarian means, on occasion
freely consented. But gridlock, whether it be regional, political
or social impasses, were infrequent, if not totally absent.
Mexicans agreed, or were forced to agree, on most issues facing the
country.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as the Carlos Salinas administration, Mexico carried
out dramatic changes in its development plans and policies without
serious dissent, or in any case without experiencing severe
consequences when silencing dissent through governmental nastiness
or heavy-handedness.
</P>
<P>
   This trend, which for better or for worse allowed the country to
experience half a century of political stability, economic growth
and social modernization, has obviously come to an end. As Mexico
enters the first truly uncertain presidential election in its
history, the country seems singularly devoid of any capacity or
inclination to agree on any conceivable question, important or
trivial.
</P>
<P>
   The examples are countless and revealing, and they range from
the truly substantive to the symbolic. Among the latter, the most
symptomatic are perhaps those related to the Power and Light
privatization project submitted by the government to the Congress a
couple of months ago, and the proposal to charge modest tuition
fees at the National University to those students able to pay.
</P>
<P>
   On both counts the proposals are arguable and reasonable;
sensible people can dislike them or find them beneficial for the
country. But instead of arousing a serious debate and negotiation
from which a long-term national consensus would emerge _ in one
direction or another _ the two initiatives have awakened passions
and fanned the flames of social discontent.
</P>
<P>
   This month's Mayday demonstrations were the most
anti-government, intense and well-attended in years. The
possibility of reaching closure and convergence is more remote than
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the inability to decide has affected apparently minor
affairs. One involves time zones in the country, and the absurd
debate that took place in late March as to who would adopt daylight
savings time, and who would not, and why.
</P>
<P>
   As of now, some Mexican states adopted the hour change, and
others did not; some are on U.S. Central Time, some on Rocky
Mountain Time and some on Pacific Time, while the one that used to
go by Eastern Time _ Quintana Roo, where Cancun is located, decided
to go back to Central Time, perhaps because the drug traffickers
found it more accommodating.
</P>
<P>
   While Mexico City Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas wisely desisted from
heeding the calls of his rank-and-file and accepted the federal
government's decision to move clocks forward on April 1, it was
touch and go for several days, in the capital and in Guadalajara,
the country's second largest city. The country cannot even agree,
literally, on the time of day.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can it figure out what to do with the 2 million, or perhaps
even 3 million, imported used cars circulating without valid
license plates, registration cards, insurance or inspection
controls. They were brought in over the years by migrants returning
from the United States, or by border state inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   All of these mostly dilapidated vehicles entered Mexico with
temporary importation permits; they paid no taxes on entry, nor any
property levies like all other cars and trucks pay in Mexico. They
have all outstayed their welcome and their authorization. The local
automobile industry is up in arms over the prospect of regularizing
these imports. The inhabitants of the northern cities where they
are largely concentrated want some sort of amnesty and
after-the-fact legalization.
</P>
<P>
   The government is caught in a vicious cross-fire between
hundreds of thousands of owners who cannot afford the much more
expensive used cars available in Mexico, and others who feel
punished for having purchased their vehicles in Mexico and obeying
the law. The likelihood of any agreement in the near future is
close to nil.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's surprising macro-economic numbers are neither imaginary
nor artificial. But they cannot blot out the collapsing national
consensus on any issue of substance, in a country where, since time
immemorial, centrifugal forces have always threatened Mexican
cohesion. More than lower interest rates, higher exports, or more
foreign investment _ all necessary and desirable, of course _
Mexico today needs to craft the instruments for constructing new
broad agreements on at least basic matters, whether decisive or
inconsequential. Today it disagrees on both.

   WINE-BROKERS (Undated) _ On a recent trip to the Napa Valley,
when the vineyards were ablaze with carpets of yellow mustard
flowers, my friend was hoping to purchase a case of wine she had
been unable to find in New York. She thought it would take no more
than a phone call. Instead, it turned into a 90-minute odyssey that
required her to drive to the vineyard, pay for the wine, have the
case loaded into her car and then transport it to a shipping
service suggested by the winery. Welcome to the wacky world of the
50 different sets of state regulations governing interstate
shipment of wine. By Marian Burros.

   PAPILLOTE (Undated) _ The cooking method known as en papillote _
after the parchment paper that encloses the food in an envelope _
has held its own through any number of culinary fashions. It was
especially favored in the days when haute cuisine was more
ceremonious than it is now, allowing the server to open the package
at the table in a show of erupting aromatic steam. Now, it still
maintains its place, mostly in restaurants, thanks to what is
perhaps a purer, more esthetic reason: a dish cooked in this way is
intensely yet harmoniously flavored. By Amanda Hesser.

 &HT;    GROUND WAR ON A SMALL SCALE: SERBS HARASS ALBANIAN BORDER TOWNS
 &HT;    600&AMP;ADD
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-CLINTON-0519.
 &HT;    EDs: For purposes of a locator map, Letaj is on the border with
Yugoslavia, due north of Kukes and due south of the Kosovo town of
Djakovica.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LETAJ, Albania _ The ground war is well underway. Just ask the
peasant farmers in this rugged mountain village on the border with
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav army snipers pepper Letaj almost every morning and
evening. In recent weeks, artillery shells have killed one
villager, wounded others, destroyed several homes and damaged the
school. Serb units also have fired ``cluster'' shells, which burst
in the sky and sprinkle tiny bomb-like mines across the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   The story is much the same up and down Albania's frontier with
Yugoslavia. This harassing, sporadic warfare began last winter and
escalated after NATO began its air campaign against Yugoslavia on
March 24.
</P>
<P>
   In an ongoing sideshow to the air war, Serb-dominated Yugoslav
forces in Kosovo have badgered Albania's northern border in a
nominal but conspicuous challenge to the growing presence of U.S.
and NATO forces in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   International observers believe the Serb forces, lightly armed
ground troops occasionally backed by heavy artillery, have a double
mission.
</P>
<P>
   The first goal is to prevent the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army
(KLA), largely pushed out of Kosovo along with the refugees, from
using the Albanian border villages as bases for reentering the Serb
province.
</P>
<P>
   The second aim is to embarrass the Albanian government, whose
poorly equipped and trained government troops are powerless to
prevent the periodic Serb incursions onto its territory.
</P>
<P>
   In the highlands around the town of Barjam Curri, the exiled KLA
is mounting modest efforts at hit-and-retreat attacks against Serb
positions inside the embattled Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
   In others hamlets like Letaj, where the KLA is not active, the
men in the villages have sent the women and children away and are
living as Albanian minutemen, hunting rifles and shotguns at the
ready to answer Serb shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to protect our houses. It's all we have,'' said Ismet
Kokaj, 38.
</P>
<P>
   In Letaj (pronounced, LAY-tie) the population has dropped from
900 to 150, as the men sent their families to neighboring towns
away from the fighting. Yugoslav army troops hold positions on
Albanian territory near the village, from which they fire their
rifles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs maintain a position along the ridge inside the
border of Albania. They are dug in and they have a beautiful view
of this district from which they shoot,'' said Bjorn Kunar, a
military observer based in Krume for the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
   Cross-border shelling by Serb artillery batteries in Kosovo have
forced about 5,000 people from their homes in Albanian border
towns, providing a new task for humanitarian aid officials already
coping with the nearly 400,000 refugees in this region from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the border villages have been unable to plant their
spring crops, meaning food will be scarce later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The World Food Program and the Irish relief organization Concern
have begun food-aid deliveries to the remote border region to feed
refugees from Kosovo and the Albanians forced from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Letaj's subsistence farmers, their faces deeply lined and
sun-baked from years in the fields, are poor but proud. Northern
Albania is a lawless land where guns are plentiful. The police and
army do little to keep order as bandits, led by local Albanian clan
leaders, control the territory.
</P>
<P>
   But historic animosities with the Serbs run deep and long, and
everyone has vowed to fight the intruders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't leave my village. I want to die there and no one will
move me,'' said Qazim Kamberi, 61. ``They want to provoke us, to
kill us, to destroy us.''
</P>
<P>
   The men live in bunkers and basements, and emerge only to fetch
water or walk down the hillsides to the nearby town of Golaj, less
than a mile away, to buy food and other provisions.
</P>
<P>
   About half of them have aged shotguns or hunting rifles and
occasionally they return the sniper fire. But it is a demonstration
of defiance more than any meaningful counter-attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they only want to make trouble with our government,
because if the Serbs wanted they could take these villages
easily,'' Kokaj conceded.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows).
</P>
<P>
   They ask a visiting American reporter when the Apaches will
come, a reference to the American attack helicopters based near the
Albanian capital, Tirana, which may be used to escalate NATO's war
against Yugoslavia and protect Albania's border.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conflict is not going to be sent into Albania,'' NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana said in a visit last week in
Tirana. ``I want to reassure the people of this country that NATO
will not tolerate any action against this country stemming from the
presence of NATO forces.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the start of NATO's air campaign, the Yugoslav army had
two infantry companies based at the Kosovo town of Djakovica, just
two miles from the Albanian border.
</P>
<P>
   NATO warplanes have been busy over the past week repeatedly
hitting Serb targets just across the border from Albania. The jets
high overhead and the thick columns of black smoke their bombs
produce are clearly visible from the Morina border crossing, the
main entry point for refugees arriving to Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed Ukeperaj, governor of the local district that includes
Letaj, believes the situation will calm as NATO jets continue to
pound Serb forces dug in along the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they will come farther because every day their
army is being weakened. They can shell from a distance, but they
cannot come with ground troops,'' he said.

ZEDILLO TO TOUT TRADE, EDUCATION IN TRIP TO CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Ernesto Zedillo became the first Mexican
president to visit the California capital when he arrived Tuesday
morning for a three-day tour focusing on trade, education and the
trickiest topic of all _ immigration.
</P>
<P>
   The last visit by a Mexican president to California was in 1993,
just before state voters approved Proposition 187, which aimed to
cut off all public services to illegal immigrants. The passage of
the initiative caused relations with Mexico to grow cold but did
little to chill the booming cross-border trade.
</P>
<P>
   One of the campaign themes of Gray Davis, the Democrat who
succeeded Republican Gov. Pete Wilson in January, was stronger ties
with Mexico, and he visited the country weeks after being
inaugurated.
</P>
<P>
   He has called Zedillo's visit ``La mano de amistad,'' the hand
of friendship.
</P>
<P>
   Although trade between California and Mexico grew at record
levels under Wilson, Davis administration officials believe
California lost a valuable opportunity to further influence trade
and immigration policy because Wilson was so confrontational.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is in the framework of what I call changing attitudes,''
said Carlos Tello, the Mexican consul general in San Francisco.
``It's about taking advantage of these changing attitudes and
making sure they permeate to all levels of government.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis spokesman Michael Bustamante said, ``Under the previous
administration, it was much more difficult to even have a
conversation'' with Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   With a doctorate in economics from Yale University, Zedillo, 47,
worked his way through Mexico's financial bureaucracy to be elected
president in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo is scheduled to speak before civic and business leaders
on Wednesday at a downtown Los Angeles hotel. He will dine at Green
Acres, the Beverly Hills estate of the grocery store magnate Ron
Burkle, who is a big supporter of Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Tello said education and trade would be first on Zedillo's
agenda, but human rights issues, namely how the estimated 4.5
million Mexican citizens who work and live in California are
treated by the authorities here, would also be discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This concerns all sorts of issues, like proper wages,
education, health, labor rights,'' Tello said, ``which of course is
related to the amount of money going from California to Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   It is estimated that Mexicans living in California send as much
as $7 billion a year back to their families. In terms of trade,
California exported about $13 billion in electronics and computers
to Mexico, state trade officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico would like to increase that amount through better ties
with Silicon Valley. Although Zedillo canceled a trip to San Jose,
citing scheduling difficulties, he will meet with high-tech leaders
in San Francisco and mayors from several dozen cities.
</P>
<P>
   That could lead to an announcement about further investment in
Mexico by Silicon Valley companies, and a greater push to increase
the number of Mexicans receiving H-1B visas, which allow foreign
workers to fill high-tech jobs in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   On human rights, Zedillo and other Mexican officials would like
Davis to explain his position on Proposition 187, which has faced
court challenges since it was approved in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court already has ruled that illegal immigrants
have a right to public education, but several other legal issues
remain.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, to the dismay of Hispanics who supported him in the
election, decided to continue the state's defense of Proposition
187 by turning it over to a mediator to review.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, Zedillo arrived in Sacramento on ``Hungry for
Justice _ Immigrant Lobby Day,'' an annual event attracting
hundreds of immigrants and advocates to the state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The immigrant-rights groups said they wanted Davis to drop a
Wilson administration policy of asking about immigration status in
a variety of state programs.
</P>
<P>
   Some immigrant-rights advocates are mystified why Davis didn't
immediately drop Proposition 187 and the Wilson screening policy.
They hope Zedillo's visit will clarify things.
</P>
<P>
   By Mexican law, Zedillo had to get congressional approval to
leave the country; he could only enter U.S. airspace on Tuesday, so
his plane could not arrive until after midnight, and he must leave
the United States before midnight Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A planned train ride Wednesday from the Burbank airport to Union
Station in Los Angeles, and a Los Angeles elementary school stop,
are the kinds of populist photo opportunities that Davis clearly
relishes and the press-shy Zedillo usually avoids.

TWO MEN, TWO ITALYS, TWO RAGOUTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MOLLY O'NEILL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is the story of two men, two memories, two regions of
Italy, an adopted country and a mania for one pure thing _ real
Italian ragout.
</P>
<P>
   To Alex Goren, who grew up near Bologna and is a partner in
Goren Brothers, a money management company in Manhattan, ragout is
a meat sauce with a mere touch of tomato.
</P>
<P>
   To Sandro Manzo, who grew up in a small town south of Naples,
owns an art gallery in Rome and lives in New York City, where he
represents a group of Italian artists, ragout is predominately a
tomato sauce with some beef.
</P>
<P>
   In their adopted country, ragout (spelled ``ragu'' in Italian)
is generally associated with red stuff in a glass jar or can. As
devout home cooks, both men find these pretenders amusing. But a
few months ago, when these two longtime friends, who are both in
their early 60s, began to discuss sauces, each found his version as
different from the other's as both are from canned sauce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where I come from, ragout means a very rich meat sauce,''
Goren said. Manzo, on the other hand, delicately suggested that no
one who knows and loves Italy could even contemplate a sauce that
is not red.
</P>
<P>
   These two styles developed over the centuries largely because of
the ingredients that were available: the Bolognese in the north had
meat, butter and cream, and the Neapolitans in the south had plenty
of tomatoes and olive oil. But clearly, pride has become a crucial
additive in each.
</P>
<P>
   The philosophical discussions between Goren and Manzo eventually
moved to an exchange of recipes and some tandem cooking sessions.
Would one be able to persuade the other even to consider the merits
of the other's sauce? Would a common ground in an age-old debate be
reached?
</P>
<P>
   Cooking side by side, the men matched each other in proficiency
and exuberance. The techniques and insistence on fine ingredients
of one mirrored the other's. One might think they were working
toward a common goal: a sauce with a deep amalgam of flavors.
</P>
<P>
   But eventually, the time comes to add tomato. In this, Goren is
as parsimonious as Manzo is unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   ``People from the north _ so fussy, so stingy,'' Manzo said in a
stage whisper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Southern Italians!'' Goren exclaimed under his breath. ``No
discretion, no refinement. I don't want to say peasant, but ...''
</P>
<P>
   The rift (if it could be called that) between them ran much
deeper, apparently, than a disagreement about a few tomatoes. How
they came to possess their recipes was also a matter of some
import.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave to him my mother's recipe,'' Manzo said, with the
reverence generally reserved for early Christian relics.
</P>
<P>
   Goren, on the other hand, had spent three or four decades
relentlessly traveling and tasting throughout northern Italy in
search of his perfect ragout, which he finally found among the
family recipes of a friend-of-a-friend. He regards his discovery as
only slightly less significant than finding the Holy Grail.
</P>
<P>
   As his aromatic sauce simmered, Goren inhaled deeply. It was, he
said, ``the smell of the Italian heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the all-important taste test. Alternating bites of his
ragout (tossed with penne, in the traditional style) and Manzo's
ragout (tossed with tagliatelle, in the other traditional style),
Goren was himself _ a driven perfectionist, never entirely pleased
and not too eager to yield ground. Manzo, the art dealer who knows
that beauty can take many forms, was sanguine and diplomatic.
</P>
<P>
   Goren's sauce is ``the best ragu Bolognese I've ever tasted,''
he said, adding that ``no one makes a better Neopolitan'' than
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Goren ventured that when he first came to the United States, the
only Italian pasta sauce widely available was red, a legacy of the
huge numbers of poor southern Italians who immigrated here around
the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past 15 years,'' he said, ``the Italians who come to
America are well-educated people from all over Italy, and more and
more we are getting authentic regional dishes.'' In this light, he
added philosophically, the existence of two styles of ragout ``is
not actually a bad thing.''
</P>
<P>
   And the opinion of an impartial observer _ and taster? Both
sauces are excellent.
</P>
<P>
   Basta! Two ragouts! &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   This is the story of two men, two memories, two regions of
Italy, an adopted country and a mania for one pure thing _ real
Italian ragout.
</P>
<P>
   To Alex Goren, who grew up near Bologna and is a partner in
Goren Brothers, a money management company in Manhattan, ragout is
a meat sauce with a mere touch of tomato.
</P>
<P>
   To Sandro Manzo, who grew up in a small town south of Naples,
owns an art gallery in Rome and lives in New York City, where he
represents a group of Italian artists, ragout is predominately a
tomato sauce with some beef.
</P>
<P>
   In their adopted country, ragout (spelled ``ragu'' in Italian)
is generally associated with red stuff in a glass jar or can. As
devout home cooks, both men find these pretenders amusing. But a
few months ago, when these two longtime friends, who are both in
their early 60s, began to discuss sauces, each found his version as
different from the other's as both are from canned sauce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where I come from, ragout means a very rich meat sauce,''
Goren said. Manzo, on the other hand, delicately suggested that no
one who knows and loves Italy could even contemplate a sauce that
is not red.
</P>
<P>
   These two styles developed over the centuries largely because of
the ingredients that were available: the Bolognese in the north had
meat, butter and cream, and the Neapolitans in the south had plenty
of tomatoes and olive oil. But clearly, pride has become a crucial
additive in each.
</P>
<P>
   The philosophical discussions between Goren and Manzo eventually
moved to an exchange of recipes and some tandem cooking sessions.
Would one be able to persuade the other even to consider the merits
of the other's sauce? Would a common ground in an age-old debate be
reached?
</P>
<P>
   Cooking side by side, the men matched each other in proficiency
and exuberance. The techniques and insistence on fine ingredients
of one mirrored the other's. One might think they were working
toward a common goal: a sauce with a deep amalgam of flavors.
</P>
<P>
   But eventually, the time comes to add tomato. In this, Goren is
as parsimonious as Manzo is unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   ``People from the north _ so fussy, so stingy,'' Manzo said in a
stage whisper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Southern Italians!'' Goren exclaimed under his breath. ``No
discretion, no refinement. I don't want to say peasant, but ...''
</P>
<P>
   The rift (if it could be called that) between them ran much
deeper, apparently, than a disagreement about a few tomatoes. How
they came to possess their recipes was also a matter of some
import.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave to him my mother's recipe,'' Manzo said, with the
reverence generally reserved for early Christian relics.
</P>
<P>
   Goren, on the other hand, had spent three or four decades
relentlessly traveling and tasting throughout northern Italy in
search of his perfect ragout, which he finally found among the
family recipes of a friend-of-a-friend. He regards his discovery as
only slightly less significant than finding the Holy Grail.
</P>
<P>
   As his aromatic sauce simmered, Goren inhaled deeply. It was, he
said, ``the smell of the Italian heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the all-important taste test. Alternating bites of his
ragout (tossed with penne, in the traditional style) and Manzo's
ragout (tossed with tagliatelle, in the other traditional style),
Goren was himself _ a driven perfectionist, never entirely pleased
and not too eager to yield ground. Manzo, the art dealer who knows
that beauty can take many forms, was sanguine and diplomatic.
</P>
<P>
   Goren's sauce is ``the best ragu Bolognese I've ever tasted,''
he said, adding that ``no one makes a better Neopolitan'' than
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Goren ventured that when he first came to the United States, the
only Italian pasta sauce widely available was red, a legacy of the
huge numbers of poor southern Italians who immigrated here around
the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past 15 years,'' he said, ``the Italians who come to
America are well-educated people from all over Italy, and more and
more we are getting authentic regional dishes.'' In this light, he
added philosophically, the existence of two styles of ragout ``is
not actually a bad thing.''
</P>
<P>
   And the opinion of an impartial observer _ and taster? Both
sauces are excellent.
</P>
<P>
   Basta! Two ragouts! &QL;

sides with salt and pepper. Sprinkle pine-nut and raisin mixture on
one side of the slices. Roll slices up and secure them with a
toothpick or tie them with kitchen string. Place them in a large,
deep saute pan and add oil, onion and 4 cups of water. Place over
medium heat and simmer, uncovered, until water has evaporated,
about 1\ hours.
</P>
<P>
   2. Continue cooking, turning meat rolls with tongs, until meat
is lightly browned on all sides. Add wine to pan and cook until
evaporated. Drain tomatoes, reserving juice, and coarsely chop
tomatoes. Add tomatoes and reserved juice to pan, and bring to a
simmer. Cook until sauce is very thick, about 2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   3. Remove meat from pan with tongs, remove toothpicks or cut
string, and place meat on a serving platter. Season sauce with salt
and pepper, and pour it over ziti or penne. Serve with meat and
grated Parmesan cheese on the side. &QL;

TRUST THE FORCE: KID-FRIENDLY `PHANTOM' HITS TARGET 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As worlds-weary Qui-Gon Jinn tells young Anakin Skywalker in
``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace,'' ``Feel, don't think.
Trust your instincts.''
</P>
<P>
   Moviegoers should do likewise.
</P>
<P>
   After a 16-year wait, bombardments of hype, grouchy early
reviews and fan mania, creator George Lucas' $115 million
preordained blockbuster has both huge momentum and the burden of
impossible expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars'' fans should love it. But even they may be divided,
especially after the buildup.
</P>
<P>
   As for critics, in their rush to judgment sparked by a backlash
to the hype they themselves helped create, some have slammed the
film for what it's not: 1977's first ``Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   True, that space adventure was fresher and _ partly to its
benefit _ less focused on special effects.
</P>
<P>
   But the moaners miss the point, which Lucas rightly repeats like
a mantra: ``The Phantom Menace,'' like ``Star Wars,'' is a kids'
movie at heart.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas, who wrote, directed and executive-produced, also says
it's no more kid-friendly than the first. In that respect he is
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phantom'' is less likely to touch the proverbial kid in all of
us, if only because ``Star Wars''' Luke Skywalker was a young man,
while ``Phantom's'' Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), who here follows
much the same heroic course, is only 9. What's next? A preschooler
saving the galaxy?
</P>
<P>
   That's not to mention the ceaseless comic relief of slapstick
sidekick Jar Jar Binks (Ahmed Best), a computer-generated alien.
Clumsy and hapless, he's forever getting into pickles, then
prevailing by sheer luck.
</P>
<P>
   Kids will adore him. For adults, a little Jar Jar may go a long
way.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some kiddie zeal can be forgiven. The wow-factor action is
irresistible, and Lloyd is no less appealing than '60s Disney star
Kevin Corcoran (``Old Yeller,'' ``Swiss Family Robinson''), whose
mold he fits precisely.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the prequel trilogy's final two films promise adult
romance and disturbing darkness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phantom'' sets the stage, assembling the game pieces with a
plot tangled by murky politics (planetary blockades are ``legal,''
invasions need ``Senate approval''). More important is the man
behind it: Darth Sidious (Ian McDiarmid), the elusive puppet master
and title character.
</P>
<P>
   But feel, don't think. With so much zest and spectacle, any
tangled plot threads become as irrelevant as back-stories for
thrill rides. On with the show!
</P>
<P>
   ``Phantom'' does get on with it, racing from the gate as Jedi
Master Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi
(Ewan McGregor) rescue clothes-horse Queen Amidala (Natalie
Portman) from her idyllic, besieged planet, Naboo.
</P>
<P>
   As fate _ or the mystical Force _ would have it, they must make
repairs on the backwater world of Tatooine. There they meet the
playful Anakin, who's amazingly strong in the Force binding the
galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   To help them, Anakin enters a ``pod race,'' a thrilling action
sequence that evokes ``Star Wars''' swoops down Death Star
trenches, not to mention ``Ben-Hur's'' chariot race.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, ``Phantom'' is riddled with repetition from the first
trilogy and other films, from its ``ascension guns'' (``Batman'')
to its droids imperiled on a spacecraft hull (``Silent Running'').
</P>
<P>
   Homage or stealing? You decide. At least Lucas borrows from the
best.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, he is right to satisfy fans with at least glimpses
of many familiar critters and characters.
</P>
<P>
   For all its newness, ``Phantom'' bristles with ``Star Wars''
veterans, from droids R2-D2 and C-3PO (the latter is half-built) to
Tatooine's Tusken Raiders, Jawas and Jabba the Hutt.
</P>
<P>
   Also back is tiny Jedi Master Yoda, still voiced by Frank Oz and
still depicted on-camera with puppetry, not this film's dominant
computer-animation.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas has advanced the latter technology to remarkable degrees.
``Phantom'' immerses the viewer in exotic new worlds, strange
aliens, bizarre machinery and intricate battles.
</P>
<P>
   Its finale is a rousing triumph, intercutting fights on four
fronts. One has skeletal armies of Battle Droids (cannon fodder
like Star Wars' Storm Troopers, and equally bad shots). Another has
a fierce, balletic lightsaber duel between scary new villain Darth
Maul (Ray Park) and Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan.
</P>
<P>
   But for all its energy and visual dazzle _ stirringly scored by
John Williams _ ``Phantom'' falls short of its predecessors in one
vital realm: characterization.
</P>
<P>
   It's not an actor's film.
</P>
<P>
   Only Neeson, with his strength and sad dignity, lends gravity
and conviction. McGregor, known for edgy starring roles, is wasted
in a subservient part.
</P>
<P>
   Others can do little with thin roles. As the future Darth Vader,
Lloyd doesn't even get to show a flicker of childish cruelty to
hint at his dark side to come. He's too busy shouting, ``Yipee!''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the actors don't star. Lucas' imagination does. Unfettered
by technical limits, it blossoms here like never before.
</P>
<P>
   The downside is that, like his early mimics, Lucas serves too
much flash over substance, even with his underlying spirituality.
He's so busy making our jaws drop that he neglects engaging our
minds and touching our hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, for his target audience, he delivers the goods.
</P>
<P>
   For wide eyes and innocent spirits _ for the kid we are, or want
to be _ this film's true force lies in its sheer, grand,
adventurous fun. Trust that force _ and may it be with you. &QL;

BONNIE AND CLYDE PARTNER FINALLY GETS BURIAL MARKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CARMINA DANINI  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ For more than 60 years, Joe Palmer, a member of
the Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker bank robbery gang, lay in an
unmarked grave in a South San Antonio cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer's anonymity is no more. On Saturday, Palmer's niece and a
few members of Partners in Crime, an Internet group that conducts
research on Depression-era outlaws, dedicated a headstone over his
grave.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not glorifying, him but he was my daddy's brother and he
was family,'' said Martha Palmer of Lubbock.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Palmer was buried alongside his mother Lenora, who died in
1928, and his father, Charles, who died in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Palmer said members of the family didn't want to
acknowledge their ties to Joe until recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he had been buried in San Antonio because his father
was living here, but even as recently as five years ago, no one
wanted to talk about Uncle Joe,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick McConal, a graduate student at Texas A&AMP;M University and
a Partners in Crime member, said Palmer was so well-liked that
fellow inmates raised funds so that he could be buried in the Alamo
City.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't want him buried in the prison cemetery, so they
chipped in for his burial in San Antonio,'' said McConal, who is
writing a book, ``Over the Wall _ The Men Behind the 1934 Death
House Escape,'' slated to be published by Eakin Press in Austin
later this year.
</P>
<P>
   A story that appeared in the San Antonio Evening News the day
after Palmer was executed in 1935 said prison officials had
instructions to ship Palmer's body to San Antonio and that burial
expenses were to be defrayed by $50 raised by other inmates.
</P>
<P>
   The simple headstone dedicated Saturday afternoon includes
Palmer's full name, his date of birth _ Sept. 29, 1902 _ and the
day he died.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer died in Texas' electric chair on May 10, 1935. Eleven
minutes later, Raymond Hamilton, another member of the Bonnie and
Clyde gang, was strapped into the chair.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper accounts said Palmer and Hamilton agreed on the same
menu for their last supper _ fried fish, cream gravy, potatoes au
gratin, corn, sweet pickles, stuffed olives, lettuce, celery, ice
cream, chocolate cake and dewberry cobbler. Hamilton's mother
arranged to have him buried in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer and Hamilton were executed for their part in the slaying
of a prison guard, Maj, M.H. Crowson, as they fled the Eastham
prison farm in January 1934. They were both convicted and sent to
the Death House in the Walls Unit at Huntsville.
</P>
<P>
   They escaped one more time, in July 1934.
</P>
<P>
   There would not be another escape from the Texas death row until
Thanksgiving 1998, when Martin Gurule of Corpus Christi and six
other condemned killers tried to break out of the Ellis Unit.
Gurule was the only one who made it after climbing over two fences
topped with razor wire. His body was found floating in the Trinity
River a week later.
</P>
<P>
   Though not a major figure in the gang, Palmer was well-trusted
by Barrow, said E.R. Milner, a Denton historian and author of the
1997 book ``The Lives and Times of Bonnie and Clyde.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There were not many people that Clyde Barrow trusted, but he
trusted Palmer,'' Milner said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Milner, Palmer joined the gang because of his close
friendship with Hamilton, who already was a cohort of Bonnie and
Clyde.
</P>
<P>
   Milner said there were indications that Palmer told Barrow he
had misgivings about a trip to Louisiana and told him not to travel
there. Bonnie and Clyde were killed in a roadside ambush near
Sailes, La., on May 23, 1934.

`STAR WARS: EPISODE I _ THE PHANTOM MENACE': UP TO SNUFF 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Things look dicey for the new ``Star Wars'' crew when their
undersea craft is threatened by a large aquatic critter. But then
an even mightier beast appears, and it swallows up the first.
``There's always a bigger fish,'' observes the Jedi sage Qui-Gon
Jinn, speaking for more than marine life on the planet Naboo, where
the episode takes place. That description also sums up the earthly
atmosphere into which George Lucas' pathologically anticipated
``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace'' arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas' new opus is only a movie. This revelation has touched off
shock waves in a cultural climate (much stranger than Naboo's)
where anything short of the biggest, splashiest and most
moneymaking qualifies as a galling flop. And the reception of ``The
Phantom Menace'' has not been helped by spoilsport tie-ins that
make it (according to an iterm in the Hollywood Reporter) ``the
first film that will make money even if nobody buys a ticket to see
it.'' Nobody, not even camp followers ready to turn this souped-up
``Star Wars'' into the second coming of the Grateful Dead, wants to
be sick and tired of a film before it hits the screen.
</P>
<P>
   But stripped of hype and breathless expectations, Lucas' first
installment offers a happy surprise: it's up to snuff. It sustains
the gee-whiz spirit of the series and offers a swashbuckling
extragalactic getaway, creating illusions that are even more
plausible than the kitchen-raiding raptors of ``Jurassic Park.''
While the human stars here are reduced to playing action figures,
they are upstaged by amazing backdrops and hordes of crazily
lifelike space beings as the Lewis Carroll in Lucas is given free
rein. The ``Star Wars'' franchise was funnier and scrappier when it
was new. But it simply wasn't capable of this.
</P>
<P>
   There are film series that grow palpably desperate for
inspiration as they age, but ``Star Wars'' isn't one of them. If
the real Force at work is Lucas' boyish belief in the sci-fi
universe he has created, then it hasn't dimmed. It's not hard to
believe that the story of ``The Phantom Menace,'' a genesis for the
trio of films we already know, was always on a back burner
somewhere. Or that the hundreds of design and computer-graphics
artists who have brought Lucas' imaginings to life really believe
this epic fable and think you should, too.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, according to ``The Phantom Menace,'' there
were noble Jedi (``the guardians of peace and justice in the
galaxy'') and a whole lot of trouble-shooting to be done. Though
Lucas' screenplay carries far more baggage in the form of
interplanetary turf wars and highly ceremonial political wrangling,
the basics will suffice. What matters is that the series' sense of
good and evil is still quaintly naive, just as its notion of
heroism remains rooted in movie traditions much less nihilistic
than today's. Lucas' big battles are crisply staged and
sadism-free.
</P>
<P>
   It goes without saying that those scenes also work hard to have
kiddie appeal. ``You mean  &UR; I &LR;  get to come with  &UR; you &LR;  in your
 &UR; starship &LR; ?'' exclaims pint-sized Anakin Skywalker, the
prepubescent who will grow up to be Darth Vader and who is the new
film's most pandering creation. Played in conventionally cute style
by towheaded Jake Lloyd and outfitted as a junior Luke Skywalker,
Anakin seems to be here mostly to try out the film's many toys.
Only in the bland conception of Anakin is ``The Phantom Menace''
really undermined by its own innate boyishness. There's no hint of
the future in him, though the audience knows this is one
high-pitched voice that's  &UR; really &LR;  going to change.
</P>
<P>
   In a notable change of pace, the earnest Swedish actress
Pernilla August (``The Best Intentions'') goes from playing Ingmar
Bergman's mother to Darth's, as a ``Star Wars'' Madonna nobly
raising her boy on the desert planet Tatooine. Unlike much of what
is seen in ``The Phantom Menace,'' Tatooine is familiar from the
first films, but it has been brightened to suit the new film's
visual brio. The rogues' gallery on Tatooine is also new and
improved, led by the blue, winged Watto, the alien most skilled at
upstaging the film's humans.
</P>
<P>
   The showpiece pod-racing sequence on Tatooine (``Ben-Hur'' with
jet engines) is a model of the film's jubilant ingenuity. The
stadium is huge and filled with excitable creatures. Anakin's chief
rival has flesh dreadlocks and a wicked grin. The course sends
racers hurtling through a video-game Monument Valley. Each racer is
of a different species, just as the pods are differently designed
and make different noises; look closely, and each has a tiny flag
to match. Somebody has even bothered to come up with Tatooine
ideograms that appear on the pods' instrument gauges. As if all
that weren't enough, Jabba the Hutt makes a humorous cameo
appearance from the stands.
</P>
<P>
   Without excessive clutter, ``The Phantom Menace'' stays that
busy in each of its exotic settings. The terrific design team led
by Doug Chiang has effectively put global culture in a blender and
come up with what is still the series' ace in the hole: a
viewer-friendly fusion of the bizarre and the familiar. Just as the
creature designs show off a playful knowledge of zoology, the space
cities jumble and recycle earthly architecture with mischievous
abandon. One of the real jaw-droppers, a spectacular underwater
bubble city, looks for all the world like an elaborate Art Nouveau
lamp.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers could have been smarter about throwaway
references when it came to the ethnic hallmarks of their creatures.
Some of the most unsightly villains sound embarrassingly like
Hollywood's old stereotypes from the mysterious Orient. And
lop-eared, clownish Jar Jar Binks is made noxious by his obsequious
Caribbean-sounding patois. Only when it comes to the new Darth Maul
does the film have no toes to step on since his Devil makeup and
horned head speak for themselves. The martial arts expert Ray Park
makes him a villain you'll love to hate.

   The other actors are often sandbagged by the physical demands of
their roles. As Qui-Gon Jinn, Liam Neeson carries himself nobly and
does his best to seem conversational with nonexistent co-stars
(``Patience, my blue friend''), but he can't make it look easy.
Ewan McGregor, a naturally dashing actor, is stymied by the flat
and passive character of young Obi-Wan Kenobi, though his echoes of
Alec Guinness are uncanny at times. Natalie Portman, under the
weight of gaudily breathtaking costumes, becomes a one-woman doll
collection as Naboo's Queen Amidala. (Who can fail to love this
story's character and place names?) But she and young Lloyd, as the
future parents of Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia, are often
wooden as can be.
</P>
<P>
   Just as ``Star Wars'' became one of the most widely imitated pop
phenomena of its time, ``The Phantom Menace'' looks like a template
for a new generation of computer-generated science fiction. And
unlike ``The Matrix,'' another film liable to spawn imitations, it
is sweetly, unfashionably benign. Whether dreaming up
blow-dryer-headed soldiers who move in lifelike formation a planet
made entirely of skyscrapers, Lucas still champions wondrous
visions over bleak ones and sustains his love of escapist fun.
There's no better tour guide for a trip back to the future.

   The cooking method known as en papillote _ for the parchment
paper that encloses the food in an envelope _ has held its own
through any number of culinary fashions. It was especially favored
in the days when haute cuisine was more ceremonious, allowing the
server to open the package at the table in a show of erupting
aromatic steam.
</P>
<P>
   It was ideal during the height of the healthy eating movement,
because the method requires little or no additional fat.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it still maintains its place, mostly in restaurants, thanks
to what is perhaps a purer, more esthetic reason: a dish cooked in
this way is intensely yet harmoniously flavored. Done well, it can
present itself in unparalleled and unadorned beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Georges Vongerichten, the chef at Jean Georges, uses the
technique. As do Jean-Louis Palladin, the chef at Palladin, and
Eberhard Muller, at Lutece.
</P>
<P>
   Although restaurants know how much panache en papillote brings
to a dish, there is an additional beauty, one appreciated by too
few home cooks: it is fast and uncomplicated in its execution, once
you get the knack and understand the principles that underlie the
method.
</P>
<P>
   When food is sealed in paper, it cooks in its own juices. It is
a more flavorful approach than ordinary steaming and less
restrictive than cooking in a hermetically sealed pot. There is no
water beneath and no lid above.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients cook quickly because they are surrounded by moist
heat. As the package is heated, the air inside expands, and the
flavors of the ingredients are swept into it, swirling and
mingling, with no escape. The ingredients are, in a sense, cooked
with flavored air and form a sauce purely of their own essence.
</P>
<P>
   Today, when efficiency is often valued over ceremony, the
traditional parchment (which requires some technique and time to
cut into the shaped envelope that most dishes require) is replaced
by simple crimped aluminum foil, with no loss of flavor.
</P>
<P>
   At Palladin, Palladin prepares vegetables in a foil package.
When it arrives at the table, it is not particularly attractive,
looking more like a TV dinner. It is rumpled on the edges and lies
on a bed of hot rock salt to keep it warm. The waiter just slashes
open the package and leaves you to fend for yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the banks of foil is a tangle of ramps, turnips,
asparagus, baby pattypan squash and tiny mushrooms called
mousserons. What you cannot see, you smell _ grass and onions and a
heady truffle broth.
</P>
<P>
   But like many other chefs perpetually in search of an
idiosyncratic touch, Palladin embellishes on the simple method by
first simmering each vegetable individually. Then he brings them to
the foil. On the aluminum, he lays a lettuce leaf as insurance
against scorching, combines the vegetables and broth and bakes the
combination to create a superbly harmonious dish.
</P>
<P>
   Vongerichten, staying closer to the basic technique, makes a
similar but simpler dish. He brushes a piece of foil with olive
oil, and then assembles a pyramid of spring vegetables _ pea shoots
and then morels and blanched fiddleheads _ and a neat square of
black bass. Over it he lays asparagus and ramps, and seasons the
stack with salt, enriched chicken stock and vin jaune, a sherrylike
wine. He folds it up firmly but roughly. As for parchment, he said,
``I don't have the patience for that.''
</P>
<P>
   His own take on the technique is to do it on the stove top
rather than in the oven. He heats a saute pan brushed with oil, and
then lays the foil package directly on top. It inflates like a
balloon, and when it looks as if it is about to burst, he begins
counting four minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The package, like a manhole, spews steam from its corners; it
ultimately becomes so inflated that just a Band-Aid size strip is
in contact with the pan. Vongerichten calls it ``Jiffy Pop for
black bass.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooking en papillote is almost always associated with fish and
vegetables. They are delicate, aromatic ingredients, and they cook
quickly. But the association is too limiting. Cooking en papillote
is a sophisticated way of preparing all kinds of foods. Meats like
lamb and chicken also benefit from cooking in paper or foil. It
just must be done more slowly.
</P>
<P>
   At Rosa Mexicano, for instance, there is a dish called mixiote
de cordero, which is lamb in parchment. It is a traditional Mexican
preparation from Tlaxcala, near Mexico City. There, meats are
wrapped in the skin of young maguey leaves and steamed, usually for
several hours.
</P>
<P>
   At the restaurant, Ruperto Cantor, the chef, uses parchment
paper rather than the leaves to cook lamb shanks rubbed with
pasilla, guajillo and ancho chilies and garlic. The same may be
done with chicken or rabbit, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, pasta, one of the most time-sensitive dishes, can be
made with parchment. The pasta is not cooked in the paper but
finished in it, blending all of the flavors in the sealed package
just before serving.
</P>
<P>
   Margherita Aloi, the chef at Le Madri, prepares a spaghetti dish
in her own atypical way. She cooks the spaghetti until it has just
a thin, firm core, and then swirls it with a simple tomato puree
and tiny meatballs made with veal, ricotta cheese and lemon zest.
</P>
<P>
   She wets a piece of parchment, lines a terra-cotta dish with it
and fills it with the pasta. Then she seals the paper, ``like a
seed package,'' she said, gathering the open ends and folding them
down like a brown paper bag, and she places the dish in a cool
corner of a wood-fired oven.
</P>
<P>
   The terra cotta, she said, keeps the heat even, so the bottom
doesn't scorch. When the paper browns, it is ready. When it is
finally unfolded, steam billows forth. The tomatoes and meatballs
glisten, and the pasta is perfectly al dente.
</P>
<P>
   Bondi Ristorante also serves pasta ``in cartoccio,'' Italian for
``in a bag,'' but with shellfish rather than meatballs.
</P>
<P>
   Cooking en papillote is best kept simple. Colina, an Italian
restaurant near Union Square, makes a beautiful papillote dish with
essentially three ingredients: mushrooms, Yukon gold potatoes and
rosemary. The potatoes are parboiled with garlic, tossed with
mushrooms, rosemary and a little butter and olive oil, and baked in
parchment at 400 degrees for 20 minutes. The result is earthy and
more succulent than the dish would be if it was roasted.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how simple, though, cooking successully en papillote
takes thoughtfulness and a great understanding of ingredients. You
must taste in your mind how separate ingredients will meld when
forced together in a sealed atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   You must think of how they will react to heat and how quickly
they will cook. Spinach, for instance, releases a lot of water when
steamed. Too much may dilute the natural sauce that forms inside
the package. Asparagus may take longer than ramps. Some ingredients
may turn an unpleasant color if cooked too long _ black, in the
case of basil.
</P>
<P>
   Aluminum foil is easier to use than parchment. It is simple to
fold _ you just crimp the edges shut. With parchment, you
traditionally fold the paper in half, and then make many small
folds every inch or so, at 45-degree angles, to get a tight seal
and a half-moon shape. It takes more time, and holds less securely
than foil. But it is more attractive when serving.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Foil responds to heat well and does not brown, so it will not
crumble when you open it. Parchment, on the other hand, must often
be brushed with water to keep it from browning too quickly _ though
the browning, at least, gives an idea of how quickly the contents
are cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Timing is the trickiest part of cooking en papillote. With an
oven, it's best to compare roasting times _ parchment should take
about the same time. Cooking on a stove top is roughly the same as
in a steamer.
</P>
<P>
   That drawback considered, cooking en papillote is thrilling when
it works properly. When Vongerichten assembled the vegetables and
black bass in his dish, it appeared to be nothing special. But he
had planned it precisely. The fish would take four minutes to cook.
It dictated the rest of the cooking.
</P>
<P>
   He halved the morels and peeled the asparagus so that they would
both finish cooking in exactly the same time as the fish. He
layered the components carefully: greens on the bottom for
insulation, tender quick-cooking vegetables like asparagus on top,
far from the direct heat.
</P>
<P>
   He considered flavor, too, of course. The morels softened the
green, mineral flavors of the vegetables. Enriched chicken stock
and vin jaune bonded the fish and vegetables seamlessly. Simple
ingredients and technique blossomed into an elegant dish.
</P>
<P>
   When Vongerichten cut into his dish, it was certainly no Jiffy
Pop. It was something divine. ``All the flavors are
communicating,'' he said. ``Nothing gets lost.'' &QL;

<P>
   There has been renewed interest in rose wines in recent years.
It's a good thing, too, because rose _ decent rose _ can be a
welcome relief from heavier red wines in the warm months. People
are getting past the misapprehension that roses are wimpy.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there is no reason a lighter-bodied wine can't have
intense flavors and bouquet. This wine is elegant, as are the Anjou
roses of the Loire Valley. Those are made from cabernet franc; Simi
makes this one from cabernet sauvignon.

FISH ON A BED OF POTATOES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In cooking, the whole is often greater than the sum of the
parts, and this dish is a perfect illustration. In a Mediterranean
spirit, it combines fish with four common ingredients to produce
wonderful flavor, texture and even elegance.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are you have everything you need to make it (you'll have
to shop for fish, of course), but given the simplicity of the
process and the components, the taste is quite complex.
</P>
<P>
   You begin by cooking thinly sliced baking potatoes in flavorful
olive oil. The combination of high-heat roasting and lavish oil,
which is almost oven frying, is the easiest and most foolproof
method for producing crisp potatoes. The quantity of potatoes must
be limited so that they all brown properly _ you don't need one per
serving _ but then they are essentially a garnish for the fish.
</P>
<P>
   The potatoes also roast with a handful of bay leaves, absorbing
the flavors of both the herb and the oil. The dish is finished with
fillets of a sturdy white fish and a generous quantity of black
olives. The combination of the rather mild flavors of white-fleshed
fish and baking potatoes with the strong bay leaves and olives is
intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   The recipe can be finished with almost any firm fish fillet.
Monkfish works very well; its sturdy texture is ideal for roasting,
since it can be removed from the pan without falling apart. But
other fillets will give similar results, including red snapper, sea
bass, pollock, wolffish, even catfish.
</P>
<P>
   I've tried this dish with just about every kind of imported
olive and, although they all work to some degree, I have some
recommendations. Stay away from heavily cured, spiced or marinated
olives; you want pure olive flavor, offset by the bay leaves only.
I've also found that green olives don't work as well as black _
their flesh is firmer and doesn't soften as quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The best olives for this dish are the good-quality, oil-cured
kind, small and shriveled. They soften and plump up a bit, and
their bitterness is greatly tamed by cooking. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ROASTED MONKFISH WITH POTATOES, OLIVES AND BAY LEAVES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 40 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 large baking potatoes, about 1 pound
</P>
<P>
   { cup extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   15 bay leaves
</P>
<P>
   1 cup pitted black olives
</P>
<P>
   1{ pounds monkfish fillets or those of other sturdy white fish. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Peel and thinly slice the
potatoes (a mandoline works best). Cover the bottom of a
9-by-12-inch baking pan with half the olive oil, and top with the
potatoes in a single layer. It's OK if they overlap a little.
Season with salt and pepper and top with the bay leaves and
remaining oil.
</P>
<P>
   2. Roast 10 minutes. Turn the pan back to front, shaking it a
little to bathe the potatoes in oil. Roast another 10 minutes. At
this point, the potatoes should be browning; if not, roast another
5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   3. Top the potatoes with the olives and lay the fish on top.
Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roast another 10 minutes more, or
until the fish is tender but not overcooked. Serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

STRAWBERRIES ENHANCED BY TARRAGON 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLAUDIA FLEMING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Eds: This is the last of eight columns by Claudia Fleming, the
pastry chef at Gramercy Tavern in New York. Her collaborator on
these columns was Melissa Clark. Next week: Thomas Keller, the chef
and owner of the French Laundry in Yountville, Calif.)
</P>
<P>
   Strawberries are best eaten cool and raw, which makes them a
true harbinger of summer. It also makes them a challenge for a
pastry chef: how to serve them interestingly without obscuring
their natural, sweet-tart goodness? My first impulse for a
strawberry dessert was a bowl of berries topped with a snowy dollop
of whipped heavy cream.
</P>
<P>
   Then I thought of tarragon. To me, it's a natural pairing, maybe
a vestige of a time when I braided together red and black licorice
strands and nibbled them from end to end. Tarragon has a licorice
perfume and a sharpness that accentuates the strawberries' luscious
sweetness. I make a syrup infused with the blanched fresh herb and
use that as a glaze for the berries and as a flavoring for the
whipped cream.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of piling berries and cream between two halves of a
tender biscuit, I layer them with thin, crisp shortbread rounds. (I
couldn't resist adding one more layer of tarragonlike flavor, so
the shortbread is scented with a pinch of anise.) The soft
juiciness of the berries seems better against the crumbly, crunchy
texture of shortbread than the similar softness of a biscuit.
</P>

SPAIN'S NEW VINTNERS LEAVE RIOJA IN THE DUST

<TEXT>
<P>
   As long as anyone can remember, red wine in Spain has been
synonymous with Rioja, the fertile valley of the Ebro River in the
northernmost reaches of the country, not far from the western
Pyrenees and the French border. In recent years, however, Rioja has
begun to confront some formidable competition.
</P>
<P>
   The Penedes region, southwest of Barcelona, was Rioja's biggest
challenger until recently, thanks mostly to one producer, Miguel
Torres. But now other regions of Spain are clamoring for attention
and, in some cases, making wines that prove they deserve it.
</P>
<P>
   From the Old Castile region in the north central part of the
country, the quality of wines from the Ribera del Duero and Sardon
del Duero vineyards has astonished connoisseurs. Once known
principally as the source of Vega Sicilia, Spain's most famous and
most expensive red wine, the Ribera del Duero is considered by many
experts to have surpassed Rioja as the country's most important
red-wine-producing area.
</P>
<P>
   In Navarre, producers like Chivite have revived old winemaking
skills to produce wines that rival and in some instances surpass
those of neighboring Rioja. Good wines now come from Valencia, from
Valladolid and even from La Mancha, once a jug wine wasteland,
where Carlos Falco uses techniques he learned at the University of
California to make fine cabernet sauvignon.
</P>
<P>
   And then, in the rugged mountains west of Tarragona in southern
Catalonia, there is Priorato, the most exciting new source of fine
wines on the Iberian peninsula. In the last decade, a steady stream
of enological pioneers and iconoclasts have gone there to transform
the inhospitable countryside into a wine region to rival the best
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish wine has had two great moments in the sun. The first was
in the 1870's, when phylloxera devastated the vineyards of France.
Bordeaux vintners flocked to Rioja, first to buy wine and then to
make it there. Eventually, Spanish vineyards, too, were laid low by
phylloxera.
</P>
<P>
   The second surge of interest came with the end of Spain's
political and cultural isolation following the death of Francisco
Franco in 1975. Millions of visitors rediscovered the delights of
Spanish food and wine. Most of the new developments in Spanish
winemaking are a continuation of the modernization of the industry
begun in the late 1970's and early 80's.
</P>
<P>
   Some Rioja producers, of course, continue to produce wines that
are true expressions of the tempranillo grape. In the past, too
many of these wines were burdened by the cloying effects of too
much American oak. The Contino winery in Laserna knows how to
handle oak and produces some luscious, big red wines. Compania
Vinicola del Norte de Espana (CUNE) in Haro, offers plenty of oak,
but some of its best wines, like the Imperial Reserva, handle it
nicely.
</P>
<P>
   American wine drinkers have taken enthusiastically to the Conde
de Valdemar wines of Bodegas Martinez Bujanda. These wines are
light, refreshing and fruity and have virtually nothing in common
with the classic Rioja style. My friend Gerry Dawes, a wine writer
who is probably America's premier expert on Spanish wines, hates
this stuff, but he is a traditionalist. I think it's tasty. Two
other Rioja names to watch for: Remelluri and Bodegas Muga.
</P>
<P>
   In Navarre, Bodegas Julian Chivite is the best-known producer,
and its best-known wine is, of all things, a rose. That wine is
called Gran Fuego, and it's probably a good introduction to this
producer's wines. I would prefer the Collection 125 Gran Reserva, a
tempranillo wine with some cabernet and merlot, but any Chivite
wine is worth sampling.
</P>
<P>
   Torres, in Vilafranca del Penedes, makes a huge variety of wines
from traditional Spanish grapes and some not-so-traditional ones,
including gewuerztraminer and sauvignon blanc. Recently, I tasted
several vintages of Torres' top-of-the-line Mas la Plana Black
Label Cabernet and was very impressed. This is almost always a big,
powerful wine, good for drinking five years after the vintage but
with tremendous aging potential. It is about $30.
</P>
<P>
   At the lower end of the price scale, the simple Sangre de Toro,
made from grenache and carignane, is, at $7, invariably one of the
best buys in any wine shop.
</P>
<P>
   In the Ribera del Duero, the story of Alejandro Fernandez's
ascension from winery-equipment salesman to one of Spain's
best-known winemakers is striking, but no more so than some of the
wines he makes. Pesquera, his principal wine, is deep and dark, yet
usually smooth and elegant. Dawes has aptly compared a Pesquera
Gran Reserva to a great Pomerol.
</P>
<P>
   At their best, the wines coming down the mountain trails from
Priorato are blockbusters. They bring to mind some great
Hermitages, the Barolos of Bruno Ceretto, Guigal's Cote Roties and
a couple of Helen Turley's zinfandels. Garnacha and carinena
(grenache and carignane) are the principal grapes of Priorato, with
an occasional touch of cabernet for good measure.
</P>
<P>
   Everything is small in scale in Priorato except the prices,
which can reach $200 a bottle, and the alcoholic content of the
wines, which often tops 15 percent. The vineyards are small, the
cellars are small, and so is the quantity of wine they make.
</P>
<P>
   The Clos de l'Obac from Costers del Suriana, a blend of
cabernet, merlot and traditional Spanish grapes, is a lighter-style
Priorato and a good introduction to these wines. Alvaro Palacios'
Clos Dolfi is more in the classic vein; dark, intense and muscular.
A four-year-old Clos Dolfi probably needs five more years of bottle
age. Palacios' L'Ermita sells for about $200, and his Clos Dolfi
for about $50. Both are rare. But then so are the less expensive
Prioratos like Mas Igneus Barranc dels Closos. It should sell for
about $15, if you can find it.

NEW YORK SEEKS TO CREATE HIGH-TECH BRAIN TRUST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW BROWNSTEIN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Route 128 in Massachusetts. California's Silicon
Valley. The Research Triangle of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, states are looking to universities to
provide the big research that translates into new companies and new
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But for more than a decade, New York has lagged behind, losing
millions of federal research dollars. A rare partnership between
the State University of New York and Cornell University hopes to
change that. Drawing on Cornell's research horsepower and SUNY's
legislative ties, the two institutions have created the
SUNY-Cornell Multiplier to Advance Research and Technology, or
SMART-NY.
</P>
<P>
   By linking academic research to industrial applications, the
program would help stave off the exodus of SUNY graduates to other
states, said SUNY Provost Peter Salins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids go to college here and then they leave, or they go to New
York City '' Salins said. ``The rest of the state is a demographic
wasteland. Yet that's where our SUNY institutions are.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the first-year funding of the initiative remains in doubt
while state budget deliberations are under way, Salins called
SMART-NY ``an extremely high priority'' for SUNY and predicted it
would get off the ground in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative seeks $20 million and promises to double funded
research within five years. An additional $10 million is sought to
double the number of engineering students the state graduates.
</P>
<P>
   A January report by SUNY's engineering deans said New York
``dramatically lags'' states such as California, Pennsylvania and
Michigan with similarly large public university systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those states average 50 percent more engineers per million in
population and experienced dramatically greater high-tech job
growth between 1990 and 1996,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The SMART-NY money would go to Cornell, SUNY's four university
centers and 3 health science centers, as well as the College of
Ceramics at Alfred and the College of Environmental Science and
Forestry at Syracuse. SMART-NY would focus research on four areas
in which those schools are strong: advanced materials, biomedicine,
environmental science and information technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for the state,'' said Judy Genshaft, SUNY-Albany
provost. ``If you invest in research, you can leverage your
investment and create new jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming from Maryland, I was surprised at how modest this
proposal was,'' added Chris D'Elia, the school's new vice president
for research. ``It's really a drop in the bucket.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to changing the research landscape of the state,
SMART-NY also seeks to change the way legislators view the link
between invention and job growth.
</P>
<P>
   Salins dismisses what he calls the ``man-on-the-moon paradigm,''
in which researchers are given an end-goal like finding a cure for
cancer. The provost said it is more productive and cost-effective
to hire top minds and then cut them loose to pursue their
individual projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most frustrating question I get is `How is it going to pay
off?''' Salins said. ``I can't say. I just want to hire the best
people and let them do their stuff. Some of that stuff is going to
pay off.''
</P>
<P>
   SMART-NY has as its symbol the bar code familiar to anyone who
has seen a price-scanner at the supermarket. Invented at the
University at Stony Brook in 1973, the bar code spawned Symbol
Technologies of Long Island, which now employs more than 2,000
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just stumbled upon it,'' Salins said. ``It's not like
somebody said: `How do we make supermarkets more efficient?'''
</P>
<P>
   In Salins' vision, SMART-NY also would expand SUNY's current
emphasis on free-market competition between the campuses. Instead
of doling out money ``bureaucratically,'' he said, professors would
submit proposals to be peer-reviewed on a merit basis.

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Given SUNY's contentious climate, the idea has rare unanimity of
support, though faculty leaders have questioned the board of
trustees' decision not to seek funding for the initiative in its
December budget proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we went in to the December meeting, they were looking
at an 8.2 percent budget increase, which would have funded SMART-NY
and a host of other projects'' Vincent Aceto, the Faculty Senate
president, said recently. ``By the end of the day, it became 2.8
percent. It's like they suddenly got dyslexia.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, in a February letter to leaders of the state Senate
and Assembly, Chancellor John Ryan sought a scaled-back version of
the project: $10 million for SMART-NY and $5 million to attract
more engineering students.
</P>
<P>
   SUNY officials also are hopeful they will see some benefits from
a proposed Senate package that would plug $262.5 million a year
into economic development and higher education.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is absolutely not pie in the sky and its not going to go
away,'' Salins said. ``I think it's a total no-brainer. You can do
this or pave 20 miles of highway.''

`IRVING BERLIN': NOT FOR JUST AN HOUR, NOT FOR JUST A DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the opening pages of his bland but informative biography of
Irving Berlin, Edward Jablonski makes a deft imaginative leap by
reconstructing the probable route and circumstances of the composer
and his family's emigration to the United States from czarist
Russia in the early 1890s.
</P>
<P>
   With quick, incisive strokes, Jablonski conjures up the
nightmare journey of Moses and Leah Lipkin Beilin and their six
children (Irving, originally named Israel, the youngest, was age 4
or 5) by wagon and rail from eastern Russia (possibly Siberia) to
Antwerp, Belgium. The territory traversed was roughly the distance
between New York and Denver.
</P>
<P>
   With the persecution of Jews rampant in Europe and
transportation primitive, the journey was extremely arduous, but
somehow the Beilins completed it without a major mishap. Its final
leg was a grueling passage across the Atlantic in steerage crowded
with other immigrants, many of them frightened and seasick.
</P>
<P>
   These scenes, reconstructed from various accounts of the
immigrant experience of the time, are the most vivid in a dry,
scrupulously factual biography that examines the composer's life
from a respectful, almost reverent distance. They also echo through
the rest of the biography, in which Berlin emerges as a classic
outsider intuiting the mood of the culture into which he longed to
assimilate and earning inclusion by portraying that culture's
rosier dreams of itself in his songs. Berlin did it so brilliantly
and with such sincerity that he eventually became that culture's
unofficial musical representative.
</P>
<P>
   The drive to assimilate, of course, was accompanied by the usual
outsider's anxieties. Berlin was a lifelong insomniac, subject to
episodes of depression and fits of self-doubt. He was so fiercely
protective of his copyrights that in the 1960s, when Mad magazine
published parodies of his lyrics, he initiated a fruitless lawsuit
for plagiarism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Irving Berlin: American Troubadour'' skips very lightly over
Berlin's paranoid, vindictive side, which an earlier biography,
``As Thousands Cheer,'' by Laurence Bergreen, explored in more
extensive and colorful detail. Except for its inclusion of excerpts
and paraphrases from ``Irving Berlin: A Daughter's Memoir,'' the
reminiscences of Mary Ellin Barrett, the oldest of the composer's
three daughters, this book reveals little of a personal nature.
Unlike so many other biographies, ``American Troubadour'' never
presumes to read its subject's mind.
</P>
<P>
   The author leaves it for the reader, given the bare facts of
Berlin's life and his enormous output, to decipher what motivated
him. Berlin's embrace of the land he entered as a little boy was
apparently passionate and absolute. The United States may not have
had streets paved with gold, as some immigrants had been led to
believe, but it was still a far better place in which to grow up
than the land left behind with its pogroms and its grinding
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin's rise from newsboy to writer of vaudeville material to
great American songwriter was swift. His first major hit,
``Alexander's Ragtime Band'' (1911), revolutionized American pop in
somewhat the same way that rock-and-roll did nearly 50 years later.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the book's more revealing quotes are turn-of-the-century
editorials denouncing the ragtime-flavored songs that Berlin's
mega-hit ushered in. These diatribes are remarkably similar to
later screeds against rock and rap.
</P>
<P>
   Among the great songwriters of the first half of this century,
Berlin was certainly the most self-consciously all-American, having
written the classic secular commemorations of Christian holidays,
``White Christmas'' and ``Easter Parade,'' as well as that
unofficial national anthem, ``God Bless America.'' That
Americanness reached a peak of snappy sophistication in the
quasi-Western razzle-dazzle of ``Annie Get Your Gun,'' whose songs
dominated the hit parade of 1946.
</P>
<P>
   From relatively early days, Berlin's patriotism was a major
theme of his career. His two military revues, ``Yip! Yip! Yaphank''
(1918) and ``This Is the Army'' (1942), are virtually forgotten
today. But these humorous celebrations of military life, each
created for a different world war, were sensations at the time.
Berlin was so carried away by it all that during World War II he
spent three years entertaining troops overseas with ``This Is the
Army.'' By then he was in his mid-50s. And as exhilarating as that
tour must have been, it was also uncomfortable, exhausting, and
fraught with obvious physical risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Irving Berlin: American Troubadour'' conveys hardly any
personal flavor of the man, but it is valuable as an official
show-by-show, movie-by-movie, song-by-song account of Berlin's
career. Every show and movie on which he worked is described and
dissected, and every major song noted. The most significant songs
are analyzed, with Alec Wilder's ``American Popular Song: the Great
Craftsmen,'' frequently cited.
</P>
<P>
   If Bergreen's 1990 biography is longer, much livelier and more
enjoyable, Jablonski's is the more thorough in its survey of
Berlin's career. Together with Ms. Barrett's personal memoir, the
three books make it possible to assemble a fairly complete portrait
of both the man and his music.

THE WORLD IS NO LONGER OUR DISNEYLAND

<P>
   My sister's not going to Greece and my friend is hedging on
China. Both of them blame Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The Greek cruise was canceled a month ago when the bombing
started. Now my sister is going to Norway and Sweden instead, which
she points out are not the same as Santorini and Crete.
</P>
<P>
   My friend's China trip was set until NATO's blooper bombing of
the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade after which protesters started
throwing chunks of cement through the American Embassy windows in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The China-bound traveler loves to be daring, which I can attest
to after the night in Venice when I talked her out of going home
with an accordion player. But she doesn't aim for life-threatening.
She'd be traveling with a Chinese-born colleague who is waiting to
get the all-clear from Chinese friends and reports things are
calming down since President Clinton's apology appeared on Chinese
TV.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just because these travelers are Republicans that they
blame Bill Clinton for wrecking their summer. My friend is mad at
Clinton for being ``trigger happy.'' My sister blames the president
for being too distracted by his personal mess to pay attention to
the growing Balkan crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of who you blame, the world is not as friendly to us
as it was last month.
</P>
<P>
   Someone once advised that if you go anywhere in the world and
walk into a cafe with an International Herald Tribune people will
stop and talk to you. Now, perhaps, we will bring along the Irish
Times.
</P>
<P>
   We have to walk softly these days and maybe even put a maple
leaf on our backpacks. Better to let them think you're Canadian,
I've heard, than American.
</P>
<P>
   My friend says that if she goes to China she'll wear a pin that
says Australia. She figures she could pass as Australian, and the
country's not in NATO.
</P>
<P>
   It's odd not to be welcome in the world. Odd not to be flat out
adored. Everyone loves Americans. And if you're also from
California, ``go Niners.''
</P>
<P>
   That is how it was, or how we thought it was. That is how we've
acted.
</P>
<P>
   The other day someone said, ``We better go to Europe this summer
before we're not welcome anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   It's probably not that bad. Travel agents say they're advising
nothing more extraordinary than taking normal precautions. Don't
get into political debates with strangers in bars, avoid big
crowds. One also said she'd leave the ``Made in the USA'' T-shirt
at home and steer clear of American embassies.
</P>
<P>
   There's a sign of the times. Sometimes a traveler takes comfort
walking down embassy row in a foreign city and seeing the old red,
white and blue. Even a Big Mac can take you through a homesick
period when you're on the opposite end of the globe. But on the
news this week some expert advised Americans in China to avoid
McDonald's, Starbucks and other businesses connected with American
interests.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose it illustrates our ignorance of world events and our
xenophobia to be surprised that we are not universally beloved.
Many years ago in Jamaica some men passed our group and raised
their fists, and at first I thought they were just waving. Once in
Berlin an old man stared at us in a crosswalk and muttered
``auslander,'' the German word for foreigner.
</P>
<P>
   A California friend approached a group of students in Zagreb a
few years ago to ask about conditions in postwar Croatia and was
told, ``Why don't you just leave us.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when things are going our way, we're not known for being
gracious visitors. A woman who leads small tour groups around the
world said she always tells her clients to practice a few
pleasantries in the language of the host country. Hello, thank you
and please. Especially please.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have a reputation for traveling in hordes, mowing down
the populace of a village to get to the next place in the
guidebook. We're always in a hurry. We can't read the menus and we
get impatient when the waiter doesn't understand English. And why
is there no ketchup for the french fries?

<P>
   We go into Islamic countries wearing tank tops and shorts. And
then we're shocked because German women sunbathe topless.

<P>
   It's time to make the good guest effort. I like this hint I got
from an American who travels to France a lot and has never been
treated rudely. She advises basic manners. Don't walk into a shop
and blurt out, ``Where are the umbrellas?''
</P>
<P>
   First you say, ``Good afternoon. I'm sorry I don't speak French.
Do you speak English? I'm looking for an umbrella.'' If you can say
it in French all the better. Either way, she promises, you'll get
your parapluie and win needed points for America.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Dulce de Leche, a homey caramel that has long satisfied the
Hispanic sweet tooth, is suddenly finding a wider audience. It has
the potential to rival vanilla and chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   It's name literally translates to ``sweet from milk.'' It first
went mainstream as an ice cream flavor when it was marketed by
Haagen-Dazs last year. The company originally distributed it only
in Argentina and later found that when it supplied supermarkets
across the United States, it could barely keep up with the demand.
</P>
<P>
   Dulce de leche has already become the No. 2 seller behind
vanilla in some markets, said a spokeswoman for Haagen-Dazs.
</P>
<P>
   Now smooth caramel dulce de leche (pronounced DOOL-say duh
LAY-chay) has become a favorite among chefs. Not surprisingly, it
is on the menu at places that specialize in Latin-inspired cooking,
including Sonora, Bolivar, Calle Ocho, Patria and Tapika.
</P>
<P>
   It is also turning up in French and American restaurants. And
home cooks may soon find it is as handy to have in the kitchen as
chocolate sauce, to spoon over ice cream or slather on waffles, as
a substitute for honey in baking recipes or as a glaze for bananas
or cakes.
</P>
<P>
   Dulce de leche is made by simmering sweetened milk until it
turns thick and amber. In Mexico it is often made with goat's milk
and called cajeta (ca-HAY-tuh), a term derived from cajas, the
little wooden boxes in which it used to be sold.
</P>
<P>
   Peruvians know it as manjar and Colombians as arequipe. It's
served as a pudding, added as a flavoring, and used to fill cookies
or to make a fudge-like candy.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, dulce de leche is still most common as an
ice cream flavor. Starbucks developed it as one of its first
noncoffee flavors for ice cream. Ciao Bella sells its version in
its shop on the Upper East Side and at Mangia and Wall Street in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Those products all feature a caramel swirl, but Cones in
Greenwich Village offers a dulce de leche ice cream that is
intensely caramel through and through. At La Fourchette, dulce de
leche ice cream is made in house and served alongside a caramel
tart with nuts and dried cranberries.
</P>
<P>
   Dulce de leche is also turning up in other desserts,
particularly flan. Vandam, an eclectic SoHo restaurant whose chef,
Fernando Trocca, is from Argentina, serves one version. At the
Tonic, Stephane Motir, the French-born pastry chef, makes one with
passion fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Picker, the chef and owner of Campo in Greenwich Village,
uses dulce de leche. Chita Marasigan, his pastry chef, fills crepes
with the caramel and drizzles the sauce over bread pudding. At
Patria, Douglas Rodriguez makes cylindrical churros, which are
donuts, and fills them with dulce de leche.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Palomino, a Colombian and the chef and owner of Sonora,
uses the caramel in a dozen desserts, not just Latin ones like
flan, but also in tiramisu, cheesecake, chocolate poundcake,
eclairs and napoleons. (No dulce de leche creme brulee yet.) The
cheesecake is sold both at the restaurant and by mail from
Palomino's new retail and wholesale company, Dulce de Leche Baking.
It will soon start selling dulce de leche oatmeal cookies.
</P>
<P>
   Dulce de leche is also an added attraction in the Peruvian-style
shortbread cookies made by Catamount Cookies in Manchester, Vt.,
that are filled with manjar and sold as Sweet Dreams. Zabar's in
Manhattan, has them for $3.99 a bag (about 3.5 ounces).
</P>
<P>
   Dulce de leche is easy to make. You can use just whole milk and
sugar, with a pinch of baking soda to help the rich color develop.
Some recipes call for cornstarch as a thickener, especially when
using goat's milk, which has a fat structure different from cow's
milk.
</P>
<P>
   Most chefs simply use sweetened condensed milk, leaving the
unopened cans simmering in water to cover for about two hours, a
process that reduces and caramelizes the milk. You might not want
to try it at home, since the cans can become overheated and
explode. Palomino said he does it that way because it's convenient.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they say it's dangerous,'' he said, ``but it's the way
we always did it from the time I was a child and we never had a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Eagle Family Foods in Tarrytown, N.Y., a manufacturer of
sweetened condensed milk, warns against it. Instead, the company
suggests draining the can into a pie plate, covering it with foil
and baking it in a water bath in a 425-degree oven for an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The results are quite similar to the boil-a-can method and more
custardy than when the caramel is made from scratch. I found the
caramel was better when the milk was baked two hours, with the
water bath replenished after one hour. Sweetened condensed milk can
also be turned into dulce de leche in a glass container in a
microwave oven, but the process takes more than 30 minutes and is
extremely tedious because it requires constant stirring.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way is to buy it. Dulce de leche is sold in jars, $7
for 16 ounces at Dean &AMP; DeLuca in Manhattan. Cajeta in jars is
available at Kitchen Market, $3.95 for 10 ounces, and at
Gabriela's, $3.50 for 10 ounces. &QL;

SAN FRANCISCO _  &UR; DINING SOLO &LR;  _ I like dining alone. For me, a good
meal can be as restorative as a massage or a long walk on the
beach. Concentrating on the food and how it makes me feel is a rare
treat that often gets lost when I'm eating with others. But for
many people _ and the world at large _ dining solo can carry an
undeserved stigma. The implication is that, if you can't find a
dining partner, you must be unhappy. After all, would anyone really
choose to go to dinner alone?

 TASTER'S CHOICE :  Prepared Cookie Dough Takes All the Chips    By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
 SAN FRANCISCO _  There was a day when chocolate chip cookies were
considered so easy to make, mothers whipped up a batch just in time
for after-school snacks for the kids. But now that everyone is
looking for time-saving bdtechniques, premade cookie dough is big
business.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's panel tasted seven commercial chocolate chip cookie
doughs: four refrigerated and three frozen. Some are preformed into
cookies; others must be spooned or sliced.
</P>
<P>
   The packages range in weight from 16 to 18 ounces, but prices
vary by as much as $2.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Tom's &LR;  (16 ounces, $4.99 in the refrigerator case at some
markets) _ the most expensive brand _ took top honors. Three
panelists loved the added oatmeal, although one didn't like the
rough texture. Four would buy it; one might.
</P>
<P>
   Second place went to &UR; Mrs. Fields &LR;  (16 ounces, $4.69 in the
freezer case at many markets). Two panelists didn't care for the
gray color, and others thought the cookie was too big and
``clunky.'' Two might buy it; three would not.
</P>
<P>
   Scoring just below Mrs. Fields was  &UR; Trader Joe's  &LR; ($16 ounces,
$2.99 in the freezer case), one of the least-expensive brands. Two
panelists liked the chocolate chunks, but another thought the
cookies needed more of them. One panelist commented that this
cookie looked the most homemade but lacked flavor. Two would buy
it, one might buy it and two would not.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth place went to  &UR; Nestle  &LR; (18 ounces, $3.49 in the
refrigerator at many supermarkets), which was just below Trader
Joe's. If the chips were better, one panelist said, it would be the
perfect cookie. One would buy it, two might buy it and two would
not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Safeway  &LR; (18 ounces, $2.99 in the refrigerator case) came in
fifth. Two panelists thought there were too many chips, but three
others liked the texture. Others complained the flavors were
disappointing. Two might buy it; three would not.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also tasted Pillsbury and Otis Spunkmeyer, but both
brands scored too low to rate.
</P>
<P>
   Panelists were Dan Bowe, associate culinary director, Center for
Culinary Development; John P. Carroll, cookbook author; Patricia
Hart, dietitian and consultant; Donna Katzl, chef-owner, Cafe For
All Seasons, San Francisco; and Kirk Webber, chef-owner, Cafe Kati,
San Francisco. All products are tasted blind.

EDITORS NOTE: Here is a recipe to make on the weekend, with enough
leftovers to use throughout the week in two other recipes plus
suggested ideas for other dishes. Recipes follow, plus suggestions
in optional trim. 
 &HT;     THE WEEKEND COOK: The Versatility of Salmon Fillets  &HT;     By Maria Cianci  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; From its richly textured, wonderfully flavored
meat to its silvery blue-black skin that could inspire the House of
Versace, salmon is among the world's most aristocratic fish.
<P>
   But when it comes to cooking, salmon doesn't require fancy
handling. Broiling is one of the simplest cooking methods for whole
salmon fillets. Under the broiler's intense heat, a thin layer of
exterior fish becomes crusty while the interior retains its prized
buttery-moist texture. Salt, pepper and olive oil are all the fish
needs to cook, and a spicy sauce-condiment, such as the one
included in the Master Recipe, is a fine accent to serve.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon fillets are naturally thicker at one end, so the fish
will be cooked at different times. To ensure moist meat from head
to tail, cut each fillet into two pieces _ thick and thin _ as
described in the Master Recipe. This is easy to do, or you can have
the fish seller do it for you.
</P>
<P>
   Once cooked, the skin slides off the fillets like a glove. If
you serve the salmon skinless, save the skin and crisp it to use as
a garnish for salads. To do this, saute pieces of cooked skin in a
pan over medium-high heat, salt and pepper them and scatter them
over mixed greens.
</P>
<P>
   Other dishes for leftovers are easy, too. Salmon's flavor pairs
beautifully with many herbs and a binload of spring-into-summer
produce.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; More Ideas for Leftovers &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Broiled salmon will keep in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
Fast weekday dishes with leftover salmon and asparagus include:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Salmon-Asparagus-Corn Soup &LR; . Flake leftover cooked salmon into
large pieces. Cut leftover cooked asparagus on the bias into 1-inch
pieces. Heat a can of corn kernels and liquid and salmon fumet from
the Weekend Recipe in a medium pan over high heat. When it reaches
a boil, add the asparagus and salmon. Simmer for 1 minute. Add
half-and-half and season with salt, pepper and chopped dill. Simmer
1 minute.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Salmon-Stuffed Tomatoes. &LR;  Hollow out large, ripe tomatoes.
Season with salt and pepper. Combine flaked salmon with minced
onion, chopped basil, finely chopped, sauteed zucchini and small
croutons. Fill the tomatoes with this mixture. Drizzle with olive
oil. Top with grated cheese. Bake at 425 degrees until heated
through and the tomatoes start to become soft, about 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Asparagus with Creamed Salmon. &LR;  Saute a chopped onion until it
is golden. Add cream and simmer until it is reduced by half. Add a
little chopped tarragon, salt and pepper; simmer 1 minute. Add
finely flaked leftover salmon. Simmer 1 minute. Pour over heated
leftover asparagus spears.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Salmon-Cucumber Salad. &LR;  Halve some Sweet 100 cherry tomatoes.
Dress with chopped mint, olive oil, vinegar, salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Mince fresh mint leaves and scallions, thinly slice
thin-skinned, seedless cucumbers.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the mint, scallions and cucumbers with yogurt or sour
cream and season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a platter and
top with flaked leftover salmon. Pour the tomatoes over all.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Salmon Kedgeree. &LR;  Saute a minced onion and minced garlic clove
until the onion is wilted. Add curry powder to taste and saute,
stirring, for 30 seconds. Add a little salmon fumet from the
Weekend Recipe; boil for 1 minute. Add flaked leftover salmon and 2
minced hard-cooked eggs. Simmer 30 seconds. Season with salt and
pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Add cooked rice to the sauce, tossing constantly until all the
liquid is absorbed. Add some chopped parsley. Mound the rice on a
serving platter. Garnish with a hard-cooked egg cut into wedges.

   &UR; MASTER RECIPE: BROILED SALMON WITH PIQUANT CHILE-HERB SAUCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Note: Seed one chile for a mildly fiery sauce or include the
seeds of both chiles for searing heat.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons bland vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   2 large shallots, minced
</P>
<P>
   2 fresh red chiles, seeded and minced
</P>
<P>
   3/4 teaspoon salt + salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup minced cilantro
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup minced fresh mint
</P>
<P>
   1 salmon (preferably Atlantic), 10 to 10 1/2 pounds, scaled,
filleted, head, bones and trimmings reserved
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground pepper as needed
</P>
<P>
   1 generous tablespoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To prepare the sauce:  &LR; Combine the lemon juice, oil, shallots,
chiles and 3/4 teaspoon salt. Let stand for at least 1 hour. Five
minutes before serving, stir in the cilantro and mint. Use this
generous cup of sauce as a condiment for the broiled salmon and
asparagus.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the broiler.
</P>
<P>
   Using a tweezers or needle-nose pliers, remove the pin bones
from the salmon fillets, pulling each thin, long bone in the
direction it runs. Using a sharp knife, cut each fillet into 2
pieces, the thicker front piece and the thinner tail piece. The
skin is difficult to cut with a knife. After you have cut through
the flesh, use kitchen shears to finish cutting through the skin.
</P>
<P>
   Place the 4 pieces of fish on a shallow-sided baking tray, the
tail ends on one side of the tray, the thick sections on the other
side. Lightly season the fish with salt and pepper, then brush with
olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   Broil the fish as close to the heat source as possible until
just cooked through, 12 to 14 minutes for the thin sections, 20 to
22 minutes for the thick sections. The fish will be delicate. Using
metal spatulas, carefully transfer 1 thick and 1 thin section to a
serving tray, surround it with broiled asparagus (see recipe) and
spoon a little sauce on fish and vegetable. Serve additional sauce
on the side.
</P>
<P>
   Cool the remaining fillet to room temperature and wrap and
refrigerate it for use during the week. It will keep for up to 3
days.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 6, with leftovers.

 &UR; WEEKEND RECIPE: SALMON &LR;   &UR; FUMET &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   Reserved head, backbone and trimmings from the salmon (Master
Recipe)
</P>
<P>
   1 small onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   12 cups water
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   If the backbone is in one long piece, snap it in 5 or 6 spots.
Place it with the trimmings and head in a large bowl. Cover with
cold water, remove any blood clots, swish the pieces around and
soak them for 30 minutes, draining and changing the water once.
Drain well.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the trimmings, onion and the 12 cups water in a stock
pot. (If the meaty trimmings are few, reduce the water to about 8
cups.) Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. When the water
starts to boil, reduce heat, skim the surface and simmer gently for
30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Strain the liquid, let cool to room temperature, cover and
refrigerate for up to 5 days. The fumet may also be frozen in 1-cup
portions for up to 2 months.

 &UR; WEEKNIGHT RECIPE: SCALLOPED POTATOES WITH SALMON &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Note: This comfort dish is simple, delicious and satisfying. It
should be slightly liquid. It takes longer to cook than most
Weekday Quick Cook recipes, but the baking time is unattended and
the dish is very easy to put together.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   2 cups flaked broiled salmon (from Master Recipe)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons (generous) minced fresh dill
</P>
<P>
   2 cups heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup salmon fumet (from Weekend Recipe), or water
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon butter + butter for baking dish
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2 pounds waxy white-skinned potatoes, cut into 1/8-inch
slices
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the salmon and dill; toss thoroughly but gently.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the cream and salmon fumet in a small saucepan and scald
the mixture over high heat. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Lightly butter the bottom and sides of an oval 14 x 9 1/2-inch
(or similar size) baking dish. Line the bottom of the dish with a
layer of slightly overlapping potato slices. Lightly season with
salt and pepper. Repeat with another layer of potatoes, seasoning
them lightly. Spread the salmon evenly over the potatoes. Top with
2 more layers of potatoes, seasoning each.
</P>
<P>
   Pour the cream mixture evenly over the top. It should reach
about three quarters of the way up the potatoes. Dot with butter,
especially the center.
</P>
<P>
   Bake until the top is browned and the cream bubbles up around
the edges, 55 to 60 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Let cool for 15 minutes before serving.
</P>

   &UR; WEEKNIGHT RECIPE: SALMON WITH THAI-INSPIRED RED CURRY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Note: This dish comes together quickly and is especially easy
with a packaged Thai-style red curry mix. A Taste of Thai produces
a good one that is available in many supermarkets. Look for
preservative-free coconut milk at natural foods stores.

   1 small onion
</P>
<P>
   3 garlic cloves

   2 ounces fresh ginger, peeled and coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons vegetable oil

<P>
   1/2 cup salmon fumet (see Weekend Recipe), or water
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2 teaspoons sugar

</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chopped cilantro
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Process the onion, garlic and ginger in a food processor until
finely minced.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in a nonstick saute pan over high heat. Add the
onion mixture; saute, stirring frequently, until it turns golden,
about 4 minutes. Add the curry paste and saute, stirring
constantly, until the color darkens, about 30 seconds. Do not let
it burn.
</P>
<P>
   Add the fumet, sugar and salt; simmer for 1 minute. Add the
coconut milk and lemon juice. Simmer for 2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Add the salmon, basting it with the sauce. Cover, reduce heat
and simmer until the fish is just heated through, about 3 minutes.
Stir in the cilantro.

</HEADLINE>
 CHRON  
EDITORS NOTE: Each week, The Chronicle offers readers the recipe
for an outstanding dish at a Bay Area restaurant, plus the chef's
secrets for making it a success. Tips and recipe follow in optional

<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SONOMA, Calif. _  &LR; It's a marvelous triad _ beef, lavender and black
pepper. But it took John McReynolds at Cafe La Haye to bring it to
everyone's attention.
<P>
   Most people might not even recognize the taste of lavender when
it's pressed into a filet mignon and seared, but it brings out a
hidden sweetness in this lean, tender cut.
</P>
<P>
   This charming restaurant is one of the most exciting to open in
Sonoma in the last several years. That says a lot, considering that
this 32-seat cafe, located just off the square, is so small and
unassuming.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning courses _ organic greens with blue cheese,
beets and spiced walnuts and house-smoked salmon on warm potato
cakes _ to the Meyer lemon cheesecake for dessert, the
American-inspired food is enticing.
</P>
<P>
   The open kitchen is about the size of a postage stamp, carved
out of one corner of the two-tiered interior.
</P>
<P>
   McReynolds and partner Saul Gropman, who handles the front of
the house, make a great team. Not only is the food excellent, but
the service is smooth and seamless and the prices are moderate.

DINING OUT ALONE CAN BE A RELAXING INDULGENCE  &HT;    
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON   &HT;     By Robin Davis 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; As I slid into my seat at Aqua one recent
evening, the worries of the day faded into distant memory. Now all
I had to think about was what to order. Should I start with the
black mussel souffle or the crab cake special? Should I have a
glass of wine or splurge on a half bottle? And what about dessert?
If only all decisions could have such pleasurable outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   As I mulled over the choices, my server poured water into each
of the glasses at two place settings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm dining alone,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' he replied, looking momentarily startled. He apologized
for the table being set for two and immediately cleared the other
setting as though it might be an unhappy reminder of my solitary
state.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   I like dining alone. For me, a good meal can be as restorative
as a massage or a long walk on the beach. Concentrating on the food
and how it makes me feel is a rare treat that often gets lost when
I'm eating with others.
</P>
<P>
   But for many people _ and the world at large _ dining solo can
carry an undeserved stigma. The implication is that, if you can't
find a dining partner, you must be unhappy. After all, would anyone
really choose to go to dinner alone?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is a resounding yes _ for many reasons. Business
travelers often eat alone. Others cherish dinner as a private time.
Still others use a neighborhood restaurant as their kitchen away
from home, stopping in for dinner after a long day at work rather
than going to the grocery store or picking up fast food.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always done this for as long as I can remember,'' says
Marybeth Beeson of Cupertino, who frequently dines alone at many
restaurants in the Bay Area and throughout the country. ``I use the
time to collect my thoughts. And often I bring materials so it's a
working-dining experience.''
</P>
<P>
   While many people stop in their local sushi bar or neighborhood
trattoria on their own, they wouldn't dream of calling a fine
dining restaurant for a single reservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'd feel weird having dinner alone at Aqua,'' says
Stacy Macklin, sales manager from Los Angeles who travels
frequently for business and has eaten alone at San Francisco
restaurants like the more casual Plouf. ``That type of experience
is so amazing that I want to share it with someone.''
</P>
<P>
   But Steven Okuley, a consultant from Denver who travels as much
as three weeks a month, does just the opposite. ``I seek out the
better restaurants in the cities I'm visiting,'' he says. ``I like
to see the best they have to offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Different restaurants handle single diners in various ways. Some
are enthusiastic about them; others less so, seeing the empty seat
on the other side of the table as potential lost revenue. Many
restaurants try to put people eating alone in places where they'll
be surrounded by other diners, subtly implying that single diners
may feel conspicuous otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   When I made a reservation for one at Aqua, I was told that the
restaurant serves the full menu at the bar, a common response. When
I made a reservation at Chez Panisse, I was asked if I wanted to
dine in the more casual cafe upstairs. And some single diners, in
fact, do enjoy a bustling atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; ``I like sitting at a counter because you're across from the
bartender so it doesn't look like someone else has to be there,''
Macklin says. ``You have more interaction with people at the bar.
It's more casual and comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   But Okuley disagrees. ``I prefer a table because I want to
experience the dining atmosphere as part of a meal,'' he says.
``Often it's a more quiet place to read if that's what I'm going to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   My preference depends on the situation, but I found my recent
dinner at a table at Aqua far more pleasurable than it would have
been at the bar. At 6 p.m. on a weeknight, the bar was packed with
an after-work crowd jostling for position and posturing for
co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   My table, on the other hand, afforded a view of the Financial
District, of people walking by and of the traffic in which,
thankfully, I did not have to take part.
</P>
<P>
   That placement is no coincidence. Restaurants in tune with solo
diners frequently give them seats by the window or other locations
within the dining room so they can have something to look at
besides a painting on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Bryant, manager of The Dining Room at the Ritz-Carlton
San Francisco, which gets as many as 20 solo diners a week, says he
tries to seat them near the front of the restaurant so they can
watch what's going on.
</P>
<P>
   When I ate alone at Chez Panisse, the maitre d' gave me what he
called his favorite seat in the dining room. I agreed _ it was
close enough to the kitchen to watch the dishes being prepared, and
at Chez Panisse, where food is an almost religious experience, this
is a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   However, some restaurants are less enthusiastic about single
diners taking up table space. Shaun Ellis, manager at Bizou in San
Francisco, says that while the restaurant doesn't discourage single
diners, it also doesn't want to be billed as a restaurant for one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a romantic restaurant,'' Ellis explains. ``And we lose
money on single diners.''
</P>
<P>
   But the bill for one versus two people can vary widely. When I
dined at Aqua, I ordered an appetizer, entree, dessert and two
glasses of wine. The table of two next to me ordered only entrees
and iced tea, so my bill was higher.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, at Chez Panisse, where the menu is prix fixe,
I did spend less than two people would have. Yet service could not
have been more gracious. Both the maitre d' and the wine steward
stopped by my table several times, inquiring about how I was
enjoying dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Marybeth Beeson says she often finds service more attentive when
she dines alone. ``In general, service is better,'' she says.
``Waiters seem to bend over backwards and are more willing to
strike up a conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Okuley agrees. ``The wait staff is often inquisitive
about what brings you to the area,'' he says. ``I often have more
interaction with them than if I have a dining companion.''
</P>
<P>
   Roland Passot, chef/owner of La Folie in San Francisco and Left
Bank in Larkspur and Menlo Park, sees single diners as an
investment. ``For me, the single customers are very important,'' he
says. ``A lot of single diners are my regular customers. They come
here more often than parties of two or four.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; Some solo customers, he says, want to be entertained, so he stops
by the table and instructs his staff to talk more to them. Others
want to be left alone, in which case he might just say hello at the
end of the meal.
</P>
<P>
   Passot believes that if single diners have a good experience,
they'll come back another time with their friends or spouses.
</P>
<P>
   As a restaurant critic, I eat out almost every night _ usually
with others _ and it's a joy. Occasionally I slide into someplace
casual by myself for a quick bite. But I've also found that solo
dining at an elegant restaurant can be a treat as satisfying as
buying a new outfit or having an all-day spa treatment. In this
case, the luxury is the food.

WELL-DRESSED STUMP WAVES `HOWDY' TO FOLKS NEAR ROBY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   West Texans have always been known as friendly people. They wave
as they pass on the highway. They wave from the sidewalks and
storefronts.
</P>
<P>
   Out near Roby _ in the community of Busby _ north of Sweetwater,
they even have a tree stump that waves to you when townsfolk aren't
available.
</P>
<P>
   It's true.
</P>
<P>
   The weathered stump is well-known in the region, though no one
knows for sure how old it is. Sheree Hartman says her family has
been dealing with it for the past 30 years, and the old-timers at
the rest home in Rotan say they knew about it 20 years before that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started when I was 12,'' Hartman said. ``Me and my best
friend, Sharon Justice, who lives just up the road, always thought
that old stump looked like a farmer waving at us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were working together as janitors at the Longworth Baptist
Church and one day we decided to dress that stump in farmer's
clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartman said the stump remained a farmer for a long time, but,
eventually, Hartman's mother, Dorothy Thompson, changed the look.
Every holiday, Thompson, who was known in the Roby area as ``Mama
Dot,'' altered the stump's wardrobe. Santa at Christmas, different
things for Thanksgiving, Independence Day, etc.
</P>
<P>
   She soon became known as ``The Stump Lady.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to give Mama credit for creating the Stump Lady,''
Hartman said. ``She did a lot of it, but the whole family helped.
Now I do most of it with the help of my baby sister, Shelly.''
</P>
<P>
   Mama Dot died two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a holiday marked on the calendar, Hartman, her
husband and sister all go out to the stump on Texas 70, just south
of the intersection of Farm Road 57, and administer the appropriate
paint and paper, clothing and adornments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sometimes catch some of those holidays where we don't even
know what they are,'' Hartman said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Her two brothers live nearby and they also help. Another sister
used to help, but she lives in Irving now.
</P>
<P>
   The family just finished Mother's Day and is busy preparing the
stump for Memorial Day and the Roby High School graduation. Some of
the same decorations will be used for both.
</P>
<P>
   Hartman intends to use the cap and gown she saved from her
graduation at Howard College in Big Spring. They will serve for the
Roby graduation.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the wig and foam head she uses will also sit atop the
military uniform _ boots, helmet and all _ for Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't know for sure if there will be a flag. There was one
last year, but someone stole it.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the first theft. A few years ago some kids from
Breckenridge took off with the giant snake Mama Dot had designed to
celebrate the Sweetwater Rattlesnake Roundup.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cops caught them,'' Hartman said. ``They told them to
bring it back, but they never did.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, Hartman found a big sofa cover at the Dollar Store
and her sister made it into another snake.
</P>
<P>
   Thefts or not, she'll keep on decorating the stump, she said. It
helps to welcome travelers along the highway; it helps her remember
Mama Dot. It keeps the family working together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe our kids will do it after us,'' she said.

 &HT;     AMAZING GRAIN: Red, black and exotic white rice varieties are 
 finding their way to our tables.  &HT;     By Janet Fletcher 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; EL CERRITO, Calif. _ &LR;  Six years ago, Ken Lee and Caryl Levine
went to China to find a business that would captivate them. Any
business. The young couple spent a week hanging out in Beijing's
rock-and-roll underground, exploring the idea of bringing Western
concerts to China. Instead, two months later, they returned home
with rice.
</P>
<P>
   Today their company, Lotus Foods, is a small but rapidly growing
concern, importing Chinese black rice, Bhutanese red rice and
Bangladeshi kalijira rice and distributing two domestic specialty
rices. From their El Cerrito home office, they fax orders to
Bhutan, a small, closed Buddhist nation next to Nepal, and talk to
rice scientists around the world.
</P>
<P>
   With prominent restaurants such as the French Laundry in
Yountville and Viognier in San Mateo using Lotus Foods imports,
these exotic grains soon may find a place in Bay Area pantries.
What's more, the company's two domestic rices _ an organic jasmine
rice from Texas and a California-grown Arborio type _ give rice
lovers even more choice and shed light on the valuable work of the
world's rice researchers.
</P>
<P>
   As they evaluate the new arrivals, discriminating rice eaters
are finding a lot to like.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they've done a good job of picking (varieties),'' says
Naomi Duguid, who, with Jeffrey Alford, wrote the scholarly and
highly regarded ``Seductions of Rice'' (Artisan Books, 1998).
Duguid praises the black rice for its tenderness and the red rice
for its pleasantly grainy taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you're talking to a person whose fundamental bias is to
eat white rice,'' Duguid says. ``We were '70s brown-rice eaters,
but now you would call us rice eaters in a serious way, and rice
eaters eat white rice.''
</P>
<P>
   The inky sheen of the cooked black rice is beautiful with
avocado slices or green vegetables, Duguid says. At Viognier,
consulting chef Gary Danko mixes the black rice with basmati rice
and serves the grains under roast duck. Pastry chef Stephen Durfee
of French Laundry serves the steamed black rice for dessert with a
tropical fruit salad and coconut and passion fruit sorbets.
</P>
<P>
   Lee and Levine first tasted black rice in southwestern China but
later heard about dozens of black rices grown all over the country.
Like black-skinned chickens, the dark, whole-grain rice is
considered therapeutic. ``If you have iron-poor blood, you would
eat black rice,'' Lee says. Typically, the rice is made into jook,
a thick porridge.
</P>
<P>
   The couple chose a variety of black rice they liked for its
cooking qualities and flavor and now market it as Forbidden Rice, a
reference to Forbidden City, home of the Chinese emperors. In times
past, they were told, black rice was offered to the emperor as
tribute.
</P>
<P>
   But even with emperors out of the picture, getting the rice to
the United States wasn't easy. Despite its vast rice fields, China
imports rice to meet its needs; Chinese authorities were unwilling
to let any black rice leave, although it is an insignificant part
of the harvest. It took three years for Lee and Levine to find an
exporter with enough pull to help them. But even before they had
rice to sell, they knew they had found their business.
</P>
<P>
   While the couple worked on their export problem, they met a man
who knew the princess of Bhutan, who had attended the University of
California at Berkeley. This connection led to the couple importing
their first rice, the short reddish grain from Bhutan that is the
daily staple of the Himalayan kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we needed distinctive varieties of the highest
quality,'' Lee says, ``and we had to have a story for marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   What a story. The red rice is grown at 8,000 feet and irrigated
with the glacial waters of the high Himalayas _ waters that,
according to Lee, have trace minerals giving the rice its earthy
flavor. Partly polished, it has more fiber than white rice but
takes half the cooking time of brown rice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice compromise,'' Duguid says. ``It's like what people
used to eat when they were hand-milling with a mortar and pestle.
I'd serve it as a daily rice happily.''
</P>
<P>
   At Viognier, Danko mixes the red rice with couscous and serves
it with an artichoke and chickpea stew. He also make pancakes with
leftover red rice to serve with fillet of beef. To accompany quail,
he makes thicker fried cakes with leftover risotto and red rice,
egg and green onion.
</P>
<P>
   Professional cooks are also enthusiastic about the kalijira
rice, a tiny but elongated grain from Bangladesh that Lee and
Levine have nicknamed ``baby basmati.'' An aromatic rice like
basmati, it cooks in 10 minutes, yielding a mound of fluffy,
separate grains. In Bengal, where it's also grown, it's known as
Govindabhog and considered a premium rice for pilafs and rice
pudding.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Simmons, the Oakland author of ``Rice, the Amazing Grain''
(Henry Holt, 1993), uses kalijira in rice salad, in an Indian-style
rice pudding with saffron and to accompany fish, adding lemon zest
and butter. The French Laundry's Durfee enriches cooked kalijira
with a little cream and sugar, then serves the hot rice with
caraway seed ice cream. ``You want people to think of rice
pudding,'' he says, ``although I don't really want to make rice
pudding.''
</P>
<P>
   On the domestic front, Lee and Levine are helping to popularize
Cal Riso, a trademarked Arborio-type organic rice grown on Bayliss
Ranch near Yuba City. Donna Wallace, whose deceased husband's
family has grown rice there since the late 1800s, says she first
planted Cal Riso five years ago, convinced that consumers were
ready to differentiate among rices with distinctive culinary uses.
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from seed developed by the grower-funded Rice Experiment
Station in Biggs, Calif., Cal Riso can claim Arborio _ one of the
preferred Italian rices for risotto _ as a parent. Arborio grows in
California, but it doesn't grow well, says Kent McKenzie, a plant
breeder at the experiment station. Arborio plants are half again as
tall as most California varieties, so they slump in the water and
are susceptible to disease. The large kernels of Arborio also tend
to break in milling.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we made it shorter, we made it stand up better, and we made
it mill a little better,'' says McKenzie, summarizing years of
work.
</P>
<P>
   Knowledgeable Arborio users give Cal Riso high marks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great,'' says Weezie Mott, an cooking teacher in
Alameda who has lived in Italy and leads frequent tours there. Mott
tried Cal Riso recently in asparagus risotto and compared it, as
Wallace does, to carnaroli, another prized Italian risotto rice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has very slow absorption and gives good resistance in the
cooking,'' she says. ``I thought it was just delightful. I'm always
skeptical when we try to copy something, but this is a lovely rice.
I'd use it anytime.''
</P>
<P>
   Paula Wolfert, a San Francisco food writer, says Cal Riso makes
excellent paella, a dish for which most purists choose a
short-grain Spanish rice. Wallace uses it to make torta, a sort of
meatless meat loaf with rice, cheese and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   The organic Texas jasmine rice that Lee and Levine market is
more controversial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I adore it,'' Simmons says. ``You cook that rice and it has
the most incredible aroma and texture and sweetness. The grains are
all perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   For another opinion, ask a Thai. Oakland cooking teacher Kasma
Loha-Unchit scorns the Texas rice, insisting it is nothing like
jasmine rice from Thailand. She first tried it in New Orleans when
a cooking school provided the Texas rice for her class. Dismayed by
its taste, she scoured the city for a Thai brand. Later, Simmons
sent her more of the Texas jasmine. Loha-Unchit tried it again but
threw it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my opinion of jasmine rice in Texas,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Thailand, jasmine is cultivated only in a small part of
the country. Grown elsewhere, its aroma vanishes, she claims.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Raun, who grows 350 acres of the Texas jasmine with her
husband, Lowell, admits they have had a hard time breaking into the
Asian market. Developed from Thai jasmine at the International Rice
Research Institute in the Philippines, the rice has _ in the
opinion of a novice _ the popcorn fragrance and slightly sticky
texture of Thai jasmine. (The rice even smells when it's growing,
says Raun, especially on a hot Texas day with a warm breeze.)
</P>
<P>
   But Asians can tell the difference. It's not as white, they say.
It's not as fragrant. It's not _ well, it's just not right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that's not `it' is different,'' McKenzie says,
reflecting on the challenge of duplicating the precise taste, aroma
and texture of a particular rice that some people eat every day.
Maybe the issue shouldn't be whether the new rice is the same, but
whether it's as good, he suggests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the California wine industry,'' the researcher says.
``We're not growing Bordeaux, but we grow some pretty fine wine.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Rauns and other jasmine growers in Texas, the rice they
were growing for the Asian customer has instead opened other
markets. Consumers unfamiliar with aromatic rices are discovering
their allure and learning that the rice world goes well beyond
Uncle Ben's. For cooks who welcome new tastes, the expanding rice
market is a whole new playground.

 &UR; AROMATIC RICE PUDDING &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from ``Seductions of Rice,'' by Jeffrey Alford and Naomi
Duguid (Artisan, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; Ingredients: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; 8 cups milk + more if necessary
</P>
<P>
   5-inch cinnamon stick, broken into several pieces
</P>
<P>
   4 green cardamom pods
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup kalijira (``baby basmati'') rice, or regular basmati
</P>
<P>
   Generous pinch salt
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons palm sugar (available in Indian markets), or brown
sugar, or more to taste
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; Instructions: Place the milk in a large heavy pot and bring to a
boil, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, then lower the
heat until the milk is barely simmering. Add the cinnamon stick and
cardamom pods. Cook until the milk has reduced to 6 cups, about 45
minutes, stirring frequently to prevent sticking and to prevent a
skin forming on the surface. If a skin does form, stir it back in.
</P>
<P>
   While the milk simmers, wash the rice thoroughly until the water
runs clear, then drain in a sieve. Spread the rice on a towel on
the counter and use a rolling pin to break the grains into smaller
pieces. You do not want a mush, or evenly sized pieces, you just
want to break it down a little.
</P>
<P>
   Add the rice and salt to the reduced milk and continue to cook
over low heat, stirring frequently, until the rice is tender, 35 to
40 minutes. As the rice cooks, the mixture will thicken; if the
rice is not yet cooked and the mixture is very thick, add a little
more milk.
</P>
<P>
   When the rice is very soft and tender but not a mush, add the
sugar and stir gently to dissolve. Cook for another 5 minutes, then
taste for sweetness and add a little more sugar if you wish. Remove
the cinnamon stick and cardamom pods. Serve warm or at room
temperature.
</P>

   The rices must be cooked separately because the darker colors
``bleed.'' They may be cooked several hours ahead, however, then
combined just before serving. On another occasion, use peanut oil
and add beaten egg, peas and chopped ham to make a Chinese-style
fried rice.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup Bhutanese red rice
</P>

minutes. Uncover and fluff the rice with a fork.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; White Rice: &LR;  Bring 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons lightly salted
water to a boil in a small saucepan. Add the kalijira rice, stir,
cover and reduce heat to low. Cook 12 minutes, then remove from
heat and let stand 5 minutes. Uncover and fluff the rice with a
fork.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Black Rice: &LR;  Bring 3/4 cup lightly salted water to a boil in a
small saucepan. Add the black rice, stir, cover and reduce heat to
low. Cook 35 minutes, then remove from heat and let stand 10
minutes. Uncover and fluff with a fork.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the butter or oil in a large skillet over moderate heat.
Add the onion and saute until soft and sweet, about 8 minutes. Add
the red rice and kalijira rice. Stir until the grains are separate,
well-blended and hot. Add the black rice, season with salt and
continue stirring until the three grains are well blended and hot.
Stir in the pine nuts and parsley.

</P>
<P>
   2 pounds slender fresh asparagus
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   1 onion, preferably sweet, such as Vidalia or Maui, chopped
</P>
<P>
   6 cups chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   2 cups Cal Riso rice, or Italian Arborio, carnaroli or vialone
nano
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   Few drops truffle oil (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Holding an asparagus spear in both hands, bend it until it
breaks naturally at the point at which it becomes tough. Discard
the tough end. Repeat with remaining spears. Line up the trimmed
spears and cut off the top 21/2 inches. Set those tips aside.
Coarsely chop the remainder of the spears.
</P>
<P>
   Boil the tips in a large quantity of salted water for 3 minutes.
Drain and transfer to ice water to chill quickly. When cold, drain
again.
</P>
<P>
   Melt the butter in a saucepan over moderate heat. Add the onion
and chopped asparagus ends and saute until the onion is golden and
the asparagus is soft, about 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   While the onion cooks, bring the broth to a simmer in a saucepan
and adjust heat to keep it barely simmering.
</P>
<P>
   Add the rice to the onion and stir to coat with butter. When the
rice is hot, add 1 cup of the hot chicken broth and cook until
absorbed, stirring frequently. Add more broth, 1/2 cup at a time,
stirring constantly and adding broth only when the previous
addition has been absorbed. Cook until the rice is tender and
creamy but al dente, about 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Remove rice from heat and stir in the cream, cheese, asparagus
tips and optional truffle oil. Season with salt and pepper. Serve
immediately.

 &HT;     BAY AREA CLASSICS: Your Gummy Mummies Came from Gimbal  &HT;     By Maria Cianci 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &UR; SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. _  &LR; You may not recognize Gimbal candy
by name, but have you bought the jelly candies at See's? Or the
licorice at the candy shop in FAO Schwarz at Union Square in San
Francisco? Then Gimbal has sated your sweet tooth.
<P>
   From sour worms, gum balls and ``Ultimate'' jelly beans to Gummy
Mummies, Nonpareil Hearts and Christmas Sour Stars, Gimbal Bros.
Inc. produces 3 million pounds of the chewy, gel-based candies each
year. Gimbal's jellies are pectin-based, contain no animal products
and, says president Lance Gimbal, are the only jellies in the
United States given the strictest certified kosher rating.
</P>
<P>
   It all began in 1898. Alexander Gimbal, a Californian and the
son of a French-born Forty-Niner, bought the Pacific Steam Candy
Co., the first company west of the Rockies to use steam instead of
open-flame cooking to produce jellies. ``Steam is a safer, reusable
energy source that produces a consistent, higher-quality jelly,''
Lance Gimbal says.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander made a general line of confections, including
chocolates, hard candies, creams and jellies. A year later,
brothers Louis and Eugene joined the company, and thus was born
Gimbal Bros. Fine Candy. The company has since passed through
family hands to Alexander's great-grandson Lance and Lance's wife,
Patti.
</P>
<P>
   After several locations in San Francisco _ one, on Washington
Street, was spared in the 1906 earthquake and fire simply because,
Lance Gimbal says, ``it stood on the same block as the fire
station'' _ the company moved to its present plant in South San
Francisco in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to See's and the sweet shop in FAO Schwarz, local
customers include Macy's, Preston's in Burlingame, some of the
Disney stores and the Sweet Factory, a retail chain found in
shopping malls. The company also distributes nationally, especially
to mom-and-pop candy stores. Its biggest-selling jellies are
button-shaped orange-and-cream soft chews and quarter-size
chocolate-fudge soft chews.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, the company plans to introduce branded products
with the Gimbal name, including the Gimbal Dollar, a red-hot
cinnamon candy in honor of the company's centennial.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Gimbal's long-term plan includes more family hands. The
fifth generation is coming up _ his sons, Ross, 14, and Scott, 11,
and daughter, Marissa, 1. ``I want to build the company so that it
is available for them,'' he says.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum here has chosen
a charter member of its own staff as its director. She must preside
over a museum that has unexpectedly become one of the city's top
tourist attractions while trying to smooth over the problems
created by the acrimonious ouster of her predecessor last year.
</P>
<P>
   The new director, Sara Bloomfield, has been with the museum from
its planning stages in the mid-1980s, when the museum's mission was
first taking shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is hardly any aspect that she has not been involved
in,'' said the museum's chairman, Miles Lerman. Ms. Bloomfield, who
was appointed in February, had been acting director since the
resignation of her predecessor, Walter Reich.
</P>
<P>
   How does one prepare to direct a museum with the task of trying
to explain the murder of millions?
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no course of studies,'' she said in a recent
interview. ``I'm amazed that we very much got it right, because we
were being pulled in different directions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Should it be a genocide museum?'' she continued. ``Most inside
thought no, but there were some pressures. How do you present the
Jewish centrality but also tell the story of the non-Jewish victims
of mass murder by the Nazis and the society that was able to
perpetuate this?''
</P>
<P>
   The mix that the founders came up with, presenting Jews as the
primary victims of the Holocaust but also telling of the
experiences of other victimized groups, has drawn 2 million people
to the museum every year since it opened in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether the museum's founders had any idea of the
number of visitors it would attract, she said, ``Not only did we
not have that, but we were worried that such a museum would not
attract people who were not Jewish.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum found when it opened that 65 percent of its visitors
were non-Jewish, and by last year that figure had risen to 80
percent. By comparison, Jews account for about 2.2 percent of the
U.S. population, according to the Bureau of the Census.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bloomfield said that the museum was coping with its
popularity. ``We've replaced the carpets a couple of times,
certainly at a faster pace than we had anticipated,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The director during most of the museum's successful first years
was Reich, who was forced to resign in an embarrassing episode
involving an invitation to Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader,
to visit the museum.
</P>
<P>
   First Arafat was invited, then the invitation was withdrawn, and
then he was invited again. Then Arafat declined the invitation.
</P>
<P>
   Lerman blamed Reich. Reich's defenders, who included Elie
Wiesel, the Holocaust witness and Nobel Peace Prize laureate,
blamed Lerman, saying he had made Reich a scapegoat. Reich, who is
now the Yitzhak Rabin Memorial Professor of International Affairs,
Ethics and Human Behavior at George Washington University, declined
to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Neal Sher, the former executive director of the American Israel
Public Affairs Committee, the principal pro-Israel lobby in
Washington, said of Reich: ``He was scapegoated. The blunders that
were committed by Miles Lerman regarding the Arafat debacle were
unfairly and publicly blamed on him, when the fault lay with
Lerman.''
</P>
<P>
   Lerman, however, said that Reich's departure ``was not caused by
the Arafat thing.'' Reich's ``suitability for the job was discussed
a year before,'' Lerman said. ``Elie Wiesel thought it was caused
by the Arafat dispute, but that was not the case. He was not
informed well.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bloomfield said she did not want to get drawn into the
dispute between her chairman and his critics. ``I've known Elie for
13 years, and I have a very good relationship with him,'' she said.
``Most people will judge the value of this institution by itself,
not by its personalities. Most prominent institutions have friends,
have enemies. That's the nature of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the Lerman-Reich dispute had any impact on the
museum and its fund-raising, Ms. Bloomfield said a few people had
declined to renew their memberships because of it, but the number
was minuscule compared with the 300,000-member base.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bloomfield was born in Cleveland, where she established the
first center for learning disabilities in the school system of
nearby Shaker Heights. But she decided to look for challenges
beyond the Cleveland area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had come to the point where I wanted to do something more
meaningful,'' she said, ``and there's not a lot of opportunities
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bloomfield is 48, too young to have had any direct
experience of the Holocaust. She said she first learned of it from
a Sunday school teacher at her synagogue, a former prisoner at
Auschwitz who had a number tattooed on her arm.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bloomfield grew up in a family that was active in Jewish
organizations but not very religious, she said. Her environment in
Cleveland was very comfortable, she said, and she did not encounter
anti-Semitism until she spent two years teaching in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   For one course there, Ms. Bloomfield read the class Wiesel's
moving memoir ``Night.'' ``When I was done, my best student came up
and praised it and my reading of it,'' she said. ``I told her that
my emotion was understandable because I am Jewish, and she said:
`Don't worry, your secret is safe. I won't tell anyone.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty stunned by that reaction, and later students
would say: `You're too nice. How can you be Jewish?'''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back on that now, she said, ``Who knew then that I was
destined to be the director of the Holocaust Museum?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bloomfield has a bachelor's degree in English literature
from Northwestern University and a master's degree in education
from John Carroll University in Cleveland. She joined the museum's
staff in 1986, when it was in its planning stages, and has held
several positions there, including associate director. Asked
whether she was concerned that she might be dealing with a
governing board that might be aggressive in overseeing day-to-day
activities, she said she was not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any memorial institution has on its board individuals whose
lives or family members' lives will have this emotional interest
that would not be there in an art museum,'' she said. ``One can
understand. They should have this interest. How could they not?''

 &HT;     By Marion Cunningham 
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Lamb shanks are a simple and thrifty dish to serve
for family or company _ and they taste wonderful. With just a
little preparation, they practically cook themselves on top of the
stove. You need to do very little other than to allow them enough
time.
<P>
   The method of cooking lamb shanks outlined in today's recipe
brings out the best in them. First brown the shanks to develop
flavor, then slowly cook them, covered, in moist heat _ called
braising _ so they are very tender. Adding vegetables during the
last half-hour of cooking makes the whole main part of the meal
easy and, most important, very good.

 &UR; TIPS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Grapes.  &LR; When you buy grapes in the supermarket, ask if you can
taste one so you can be sure they are sweet. Thompson seedless
grapes are the right choice for the pleasing, simple dessert I've
included today.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Zest.  &LR; Zest is the outside, colored rind of citrus fruit. It is
the most flavorful part of the fruit and it gives food a lovely
fragrance and flavor of lemon, lime or orange.
</P>
<P>
   When removing the zest, it is important to remove only the
bright, shiny thin outer part of the peel, leaving behind the
white, bitter part of the skin (the pith).
</P>
<P>
   You can use a zester, a fine grater, a vegetable peeler or a
sharp paring knife to remove the zest. Or stack pieces of zest on
top of one another and cut very thin slices lengthwise into strips.
Chop the thin strips crosswise into very fine ``minced'' pieces.

   &UR; LAMB SHANKS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   From ``Learning to Cook With Marion Cunningham'' (Knopf, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   2 lemons
</P>
<P>
   4 garlic cloves
</P>
<P>
   4 lamb shanks
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons flour
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons salt
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   1 bay leaf
</P>
<P>
   2 cups water
</P>
<P>
   6 carrots
</P>
<P>
   3 medium-size yellow onions
</P>
<P>
   4 small potatoes
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Instructions: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Preparing the Lemon and Garlic: &LR;  Grate the zest of 1 or 2
lemons to make 1 tablespoon of grated rind. After you have removed
the zest, cut the lemons in half and squeeze the juice from them.
Strain and measure about 1/4 cup.
</P>
<P>
   Peel the garlic cloves and slice each lengthwise into 4 slivers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Preparing the Lamb:  &LR; Using a sharp paring knife, cut 4 deep
slits in the meaty part of each lamb shank, and insert a garlic
sliver into each slit.
</P>
<P>
   Put the flour, salt and pepper on a 12-inch piece of wax paper
and stir together. Spread the flour out a little and roll each
shank in it so all sides are coated. Shake off the excess.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Starting the Cooking:  &LR; Put the oil in a large heavy-bottom pot
(one with a lid) and turn the heat to medium-high. After about 15
seconds, hold your hand about an inch above the bottom of the pot.
If it feels hot, add the shanks and brown them on all sides,
keeping the heat at medium-high. This will take about 5 to 10
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   When the shanks are all browned, turn the heat to low. Add the
bay leaf, lemon rind, lemon juice, and 1 cup of the water to the
pot. Put the lid on, and simmer the shanks over low heat for 1
hour.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Preparing the Vegetables While the Shanks are Cooking:  &LR; Peel
the carrots and cut crosswise into 11/2-inch pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the papery skin from the onions and cut them into
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Rinse the potatoes, leaving them unpeeled.
</P>
<P>
   When the shanks have cooked for 1 hour, add the carrots, onions,
potatoes and the other 1 cup water to the pot and cook, covered,
for another 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Finishing and Serving the Shanks:  &LR; Remove the lid and pierce
the vegetables with a fork. If they are tender, they are done. The
shanks should also be very tender by now.
</P>
<P>
   Put the shanks on a platter and surround with the vegetables.
Serve hot.

   MIAMI _ Coca-Cola may be America's most popular soft drink, yet
Orlando housewife America Vaughan(CQ both) is eager to point out
how her new soda, Havana Cola, is different.

   It has a citric taste, she says, with the distinctive touch of
Key lime. And although Havana Cola's can is red -- like Coca-Cola's
-- its shade is a candy-apple one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a different taste, and I think a better one,'' boasts
Vaughan, a 48-year-old mother of four. ``I believe once people try
it they'll pull a switcheroo.''
</P>
<P>
   If sheer exuberance were an asset, Vaughan -- who's never run a
business before -- would already be a millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   But exuberance alone may not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   By launching a new soft drink, Vaughan has taken the plunge into
the already crowded and hostile American beverage industry, one
that's filled with ample examples of prodigiousness.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers in the United States already down more soft drinks
than in any other country outside of Mexico, leaving the Coca-Cola
Co. and the Pepsi-Cola Co. battling for every smidgen of market
share they can find.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Two together enjoy more than 75 percent of market share
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   And they have decades worth of advertising know-how to make sure
sales keep climbing.
</P>
<P>
   So with the average American currently drinking more than 800
servings of soda a year, industry experts doubt that the U.S.
market can yield much more growth -- unless it's at someone else's
expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``A uniquely flavored brand has the potential of getting a niche
in some regional markets, but beyond that I think the challenge
would be a herculean one,'' said John Sicher, editor of Beverage
Digest, an industry newsletter based in Bedford Hills, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are already so many soft drinks,'' he said. ``I think
people have plenty of choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Vaughan's not the type to be easily deterred.
</P>
<P>
   Since it went on the market last November, she has sold some
75,000 cans of Havana Cola. Tens of thousands more have been given
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a nice clean taste that will liberate the taste buds,
and people just love it,'' the Cuban-born Vaughan beams, ``so I
think it's going to do very well.''
</P>
<P>
   The product has started to win a faithful following in Florida,
one which Vaughan hopes will grow to include customers in several
other states.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, she scored perhaps her biggest coup yet when
Houston-based Sysco Corp., the nation's largest marketer and
distributor of food-service products, agreed to distribute Havana
Cola.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughan is so emboldened by her product's potential that she's
striking out with another risky venture: the development of a diet
version of Havana Cola with the help of a chemist in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Dead serious, she says her goal is to earn 3 percent of the cola
market in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   That's news to Atlanta-based Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, I guess I'm aware of the product, but not all that
much,'' said Cocal Cola spokeswoman Polly Howes, emphasizing,
though, that Coca-Cola welcomes any and all competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly there is plenty of room for anyone out there who
wants to get into this business,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Havana Cola's currently available at restaurants and small
grocery stores across central and south Florida, including several
in Miami and Orlando. Barnie's Coffee and Tea Co. has agreed to
sell it, as has the Latin Quarter, a new restaurant at Universal
Studios in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   The owners of the Havana restaurant in West Palm Beach, Fla.
call it their ``house soda.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The drink is selling really well,'' said Rafael Perez,
Havana's assistant owner. ``Everyone who tries it wants more.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea for Havana Cola was born by happenstance in the Florida
Keys, where Vaughan and her children often vacationed in the 1980s.
While there, her brother, who didn't always like to drink alcohol,
would mix Cuba Libres minus the rum, a taste the whole family
enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always enjoyed the taste of cola and lime,'' she said.
``I thought, 'Why not share the taste with others'?''
</P>
<P>
   In her native Cuba -- which she left in the 1960s for the United
States -- cola splashed with lime juice was a popular drink.
</P>
<P>
   She spent months refining that cola-and-lime taste in her
Orlando kitchen, experimenting on friends and neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, she finally felt the time was ripe to launch her own
company. She did some research at the public library and called the
U.S. Department of Commerce to find out how to register a
trademark.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughan said her son, Greg, 23, came up with the name Havana
Cola.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were in the Floriday Keys we would see a lot of Cuban
rafters trying to make it to Florida, and so my son became very
interested in Cuba and came up with the name,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Before it can become a registered trademark, a product's name
must be published in a weekly government trademark magazine, giving
objectors a chance to notify the commerce department's patent and
trademark office.
</P>
<P>
   One early hitch developed after attorneys representing Havana
Club rum opposed registration of the name Havana Cola in early
1995, fearing consumers might be confused by the products' similar
names.
</P>
<P>
   Havana Club backed down, though, in late 1997, and Havana Cola
was registered as a trademark by August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   She was then free to sign up with a bottler, and start locating
sales outlets.
</P>
<P>
   But the road ahead will be a tough one, as even major national
brands have gone from hot to not in just a few years.
</P>
<P>
   For example, California Cooler, the brand that sparked the wine
cooler craze that spread in the 1980s, faded rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   And the industry's major players are adding new products all the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola has developed a host of new drinks, including a
citrus-flavored one called Surge. Royal Crown Co. has come up with
a drink called RC Edge it dubs a ``power cola'' loaded with extra
caffeine and other energy boosters.
</P>
<P>
   But far from shrinking from the challenge, Vaughan has launched
a publicity blitzkrieg in Florida that's already fomented a buzz
about her cola.
</P>
<P>
   In March, she set up a promotional booth at the popular Carnaval
Miami festival. Vaughan crowned a Miss Havana Cola at the booth, a
Colombian named Lexdiana Ortiz. In April, the cola was the featured
beverage at a three-day, dead-fish-throwing contest -- known as a
mullet toss -- near Pensacola, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The Havana Cola logo also will be featured on Ron Burkett's race
car when he competes June 19 in the Slim Jim NASCAR race at the
Lanier National Speedway in Gainesville, Ga. One of her neighbors
is a friend of Burkett's -- now a big fan of the drink.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Vaughan continues to give away free samples of Havana
Cola everywhere she can.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my belief that people's palates have a very good
memory,'' Vaughan said. ``If I give them a taste, you can bet
they'll be back for more.''

   MIAMI _ Coca-Cola may be America's most popular soft drink, yet
Orlando housewife America Vaughan(CQ both) is eager to point out
how her new soda, Havana Cola, is different.
</P>
<P>
   It has a citric taste, she says, with the distinctive touch of
Key lime. And although Havana Cola's can is red -- like Coca-Cola's

<P>
   Q: How many volcanoes, active or dormant, are there in the
continental United States?
</P>
<P>
   _ W.P., N. Richland Hills, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: The World Wide Web site Volcano World lists 68 that aren't in
either Alaska or Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Volcanoes are found in Arizona (9), California (10), Idaho (3),
New Mexico (10), Oregon (23), South Dakota (1), Utah (2),
Washington (8) and Wyoming (2).
</P>
<P>
   ``About 10 percent of the more than 1,500 volcanoes that have
erupted in the past 10,000 years are located inthe United
States,'' according to the Cascades Volcano Observatory in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Volcano World, which is published at volcano.und.edu, tracks
current volcanic activity. The most recent event in the continental
United States was a series of small earthquakes and the release of
carbon dioxide at Mount St. Helens in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is possible that the current earthquake activity may
eventually lead to renewed volcanic activity,'' according to the
Cascades observatory.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened to the woman who shot Andy Warhol in the
'60s?
</P>
<P>
   _ P.C., Albany, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A: Valerie Solanas, a feminist writer who had appeared in
Warhol's film ``I, a Man,'' died of pneumonia in 1988 at age 52.
</P>
<P>
   Solanas shot Warhol on June 3, 1968, after blaming him for
problems related to a book contract she had signed. ``It's not
often that I shoot somebody. I didn't do it for nothing,'' she said
at her arraignment.
</P>
<P>
   The incident was the focus of a 1996 film, ``I Shot Andy
Warhol.''
</P>
<P>
   After shooting Warhol in front of several witnesses, Solanas
pleaded guilty to first-degree assault and served three years
before her release. She was destitute at the time of her death in
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many Kool-Aid flavors are there?
</P>
<P>
   _ M.C., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: When Edwin Perkins introduced the drink powder Kool-Ade in
1927, there were originally seven flavors: Cherry, Grape,
Lemon-Lime, Orange, Raspberry, Root Beer and Strawberry.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Kraft Foods sells all these Kool-Aid
flavors today except Raspberry and Root Beer, according to a list
compiled by the Internet discussion group alt.drink.kool-aid.
</P>
<P>
   These flavors are also available: Black Cherry, Blastin' Berry
Cherry, Grape Berry Splash, Ice Blue Island Twist, Ice Blue

</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard that NBC is going to do away with ``Another World.''
When is the last day it will be broadcast?
</P>
<P>
   _ G.B., Burleson, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: NBC will air ``Another World'' for the last time on June 25,
35 years after the soap premiered on May 4, 1964.
</P>
<P>
   The network canceled the show in April to make room for
``Passions,'' a new soap that will begin airing July 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another World'' fans are encouraging Procter &AMP; Gamble, which
produces the soap, to find a new network or syndicate the show
rather than halt production in late May. To contact the company,
write to Robert Wehling, Procter &AMP; Gamble, 1 Procter &AMP; Gamble
Plaza, Cincinnati, OH 45202.
</P>
<P>
   The National Enquirer is collecting letters to send to NBC about
the cancellation. To participate, write to ``Another World,''
National Enquirer, Lantana, FL 33464-0002.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I write to Sarah Michelle Gellar of ``Buffy the
Vampire Slayer''?
</P>
<P>
   _ D.S.B., Clifton, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to Gellar or any of her co-stars in care of ``Buffy the
Vampire Slayer,'' Warner Bros. Television Network, 4000 Warner
Blvd., Burbank, CA 91522.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old actress broke her wrist during this season's
filming of ``Buffy,'' which concludes May 22. After starring in
five movies since the TV series began, Gellar has not announced
whether she'll take on any new projects this summer.

her drugs are not approved for use in children under 12. One
tablet, her mother must break in half. Another pill, the mother
cuts in two with a gadget from the pharmacist.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is bigger now. When she needed quarters, that was really
hard,'' says Wendy Goldberg, Abby's mother. The pill is coated and
hard, like a little stone. It doesn't always divide evenly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I give her the big half or the small half? I usually give
her the bigger piece in the morning on the theory that if something
really bad happens, at least we will always be awake,'' the mother
testified at a joint hearing sponsored by the Food and Drug
Administration and the American Academy of Pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
   About 70 percent of the drugs used in children have never been
tested in children, according to the Pediatric Pharmacy Advocacy
Group. Even most of the drugs used in the smallest, premature
infants usually are not approved for children.
</P>
<P>
   But that changed April 1, when the FDA began requiring that new
drugs with potential to benefit children be tested in children and
labeled assafe and effective for use in children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been experimenting on children for 20 years now,'' says
Dr. Dianne Murphy, director of pediatrics for the FDA. ``Most drugs
used in children have never been adequately tested in children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important because we know children are not just small
adults. They are changing. Their systems are changing, their brains
are changing, their guts are changing, their bones are all
changing, and we need to know if we are giving them the right dose
_ enough to be therapeutic but not more than necessary,'' Murphy
says.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a lack of scientific evidence to support their safety
and effectiveness in youngsters, drugs that work well in adults are
commonly used in children because doctors believe they offer the
best available treatment. (Once a drug is approved by the FDA,
doctors are able to prescribe it for any age patient, as best they
see fit.) In lieu of testing, pediatricians often base their
decisions on reports published in professional journals and on
word-of-mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Prozac, for instance, was prescribed 349,000 times to pediatric
patients in a single year _ even though the popular anti-depressant
carries a disclaimer warning that ``safety and effectiveness for
those under 12 years of age are not established.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Children sometimes react differently,'' Murphy points out.
``Sometimes they tolerate drugs better than adults so there are
less adverse effects, but they may have different adverse
effects.''
</P>
<P>
   A whole generation of children had their teeth damaged and
discolored in the late 1960s and early 1970s because of the popular
antibiotic tetracycline.
</P>
<P>
   Adult males who tested the drug had no such side effects, and it
was never tested in children or in women. As a result, it was years
before researchers made the connection between the drug and the
discolored teeth.
</P>
<P>
   It was even longer before anyone realized that tetracycline
antibiotics cross the placenta in pregnant women and are stored in
the fetus's bones and teeth, where they combine with calcium. As a
result, bone growth may be slow, the baby's teeth may be
permanently yellow, and the tooth enamel may be soft and abnormally
susceptible to cavities.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, chloramphenicol, an antibiotic that killed
penicillin-resistant infections, was widely used in adults. Newborn
babies with infections were also given chloramphenicol, but without
the benefit of studies on pediatric dosing. Twenty-three babies
died before it was learned that the immature livers of these
infants were unable to clear the drug from their bodies, allowing
toxic doses to build up.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, pediatric AIDS specialists say many babies born
with HIV may have died because they were not given drugs developed
to treat HIV in adults. Ten years ago, doctors were hesitant to
prescribe the powerful new drugs for babies or pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit Pediatric Pharmacy Advocacy Group was set up to
improve the safe use of medications in children through educational
programs for pediatric pharmacists; monitoring FDA testimony on
drugs and adverse drug reactions; and collecting data that deal
with the safe use of drugs in children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to get pediatric dosage forms established,''
says Hank Wedemeyer, the group's executive director. ``Most drugs
today have to be manipulated by pharmacists for use in children.
They may need to smash a 500 milligram tablet, break it up to get
the right amount for a child or dissolve it so a child can take it.

   TEL AVIV _ The crushing fall of Benjamin Netanyahu tells an
amazing Israeli story of a bright man who changed the rules of the
local political game, and became his own victim.
</P>
<P>
   It was not his policies, though they did set Israel back, that
brought about his resonant, pathetic defeat. It was his character.
</P>
<P>
   A child when Israel was born, I have never witnessed an election
campaign here in which the main issue was the incumbent leader's
personality. And for good reason.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu was, as The Economist once dubbed him, a serial
bungler, an erratic leader for a nation in urgent need for an
orderly agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The popular slogan, referring to his nickname _ ``Just Not
Bibi'' _ ended the three-year dominance of a flawed politician over
the Israeli scene. This abysmal failure to make good on a vaulting
ambition gave his short career almost Shakespearean dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Netanyahu's self-destructive psyche, the election was
about Israel's political culture.
</P>
<P>
   In as much as they are surprisingly conservative, and still
gripped by tribal allegiances, the majority of Israelis felt they
had had enough.
</P>
<P>
   Enough of the cunning play on their angst over Arab threats.
Enough of their leader's unbearable propensity to alienate almost
all his colleagues and most of Israel's friends in the world, while
engaging his opponents with heated hate rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   Opposite Netanyahu, in a meticulous Tony Blair-like campaign,
Ehud Barak smartly grasped the popular urge for reconciliation,
stability and basic common sense.
</P>
<P>
   At times, as his understated tone made some of his TV
appearances seem a disaster, his supporters despaired. But as
Netanyahu was intensifying his populist, distorted attacks on the
``leftist'' elites and on the media, he isolated himself in an
increasingly paranoid campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bibi became a burden. Barak gained momentum. He now enjoys a
rare parliamentary leeway in a political system used to choking
near-ties.
</P>
<P>
   His victory is actually a revival of the late Yitzhak Rabin's
era, which was tragically cut short in the midst of major political
and economic achievements. Barak will now have to renew that
national agenda.
</P>
<P>
   In a vague campaign of soundbites, steered by a host of American
consultants, there was, for example, hardly a mention of the
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations stopped by Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Barak remained opaque on whether his wish for a wide power base
might evolve into an embrace of the religious parties _ and a
cohabitation with the Likud party that poisoned the politics of the
1980s. This will be the stuff of criticism soon awaiting the prime
minister designate.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, hope is rampant. Never have so many enthusiastic
Israelis thronged in the squares to celebrate on election night, as
if it were Independence Day. They also signaled their expectation
of a new leader who would cut a new national deal. &QL;

   ``We want the pharmaceutical companies to provide more
information so more of the good new drugs can benefit children,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies have 20 months to comply with the new FDA
requirement.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the FDA asked drug companies to begin testing and
labeling their products for use in children. Manufacturers were
asked to survey existing data and determine whether those data were
sufficient to establish pediatric indications.
</P>
<P>
   However, in 1997, only 37 percent of the new drugs with
potential usefulness for children had some pediatric labeling.
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies drag their feet because they say it is very
difficult to do double-blind studies in children, to get a large
group of parents to allow their children to be in a study in which
some will go without treatment.
</P>
<P>
   A double-blind study tests a new drug against a placebo or an
established drug with both the doctors and patients ``blinded'' as
to who is getting which formulation. Such studies are still the
gold standard for testing the effectiveness of new drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Also, such studies are not financially beneficial for the drug
companies. Children account for less than 10 percent of their
revenues, Wedemeyer says.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulation requires such testing for new drugs and says
the FDA can also require testing on already-marketed products in
compelling circumstances, such as when a drug is commonly
prescribed for use in children, but the absence of adequate
labeling could pose significant risks.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA has said it will require pediatric testing in certain
classes of drugs such as steroids, anti-depressants, prescription
pain relievers, drugs for stomach and intestinal illnesses, and
asthma drugs. (There currently are no asthma drugs labeled for use
in children under 2.)
</P>
<P>
   For FDA approval of a new drug, pharmaceutical companies are
required to provide data on basic animal research studies as well
as a series of clinical studies showing the drug is safe and
effective. Until about eight years ago, almost all drug testing was
done in adult men.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in 1977, the FDA issued guidelines that effectively
banned women of child-bearing age from participating in early
clinical trials on new drugs. The ban was overturned in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, the FDA first encouraged drug companies to include
children in studies of drugs specifically targeted at children, but
it was not until 1994 that they began encouraging drug companies to
test more drugs on children and to analyze the data that were being
collected so that they could better label drugs for use in
children.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulations give drug companies extended exclusivity on
their products in exchange for the pediatric testing.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   DRUGS LIST
</P>
<P>
   The FDA has compiled a list of the 10 drugs most widely
prescribed for children in 1994 that were never tested or approved
for use in children.
</P>
<P>
   Albuterol (for asthma) _ prescribed 1,626,000 times for children
under 12.
</P>
<P>
   Phenergan (for allergic reactions) _ prescribed 663,000 times
for children under 2.
</P>
<P>
   Ampicillin injections (for infection) _ prescribed 639,000 times
for children under 12.
</P>
<P>
   Auralgan otic solution (for ear pain) _ prescribed 600,000 times
for children under 16.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ As bombs rain down on ``strategic'' targets while
Serbian forces empty Kosovo, public opinion in Britain, France and
the United States largely approves NATO's ``air campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, many of those polled feel that a ``ground
campaign'' will eventually be required. Most defense experts in the
three countries mirror those conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Kosovo has a vocabulary problem. The terms ``air''
and ``ground'' seem to offer a classic choice of military options.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they offer incomplete choices, fail to reflect accepted
U.S. or NATO military concepts, and thus blur _ perhaps fatally _
the search for a military solution of NATO's current dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   The saying that hope is not a method expresses that dilemma. A
single-dimension strategy based on the use of force to ``signal''
and ``punish,'' instead of decisive force used in all dimensions to
compel, leaves only the hope that all will come out right.
</P>
<P>
   There is a better choice. The campaign which offers the surest,
and in the long run a less costly, way to accomplish the alliance's
political goals _ surer than the hope-to-win choice of an air-only
effort, and leaner than a ``ground campaign's'' hundreds of
thousands of troops _ is the one already embodied in the
war-fighting doctrine of NATO and the U.S. armed forces: a truly
joint campaign in all dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   In the joint U.S. and NATO military doctrine published after the
Gulf War, the term ``air campaign'' was deliberately never used.
</P>
<P>
   The Gulf War had made clear two things about air power. First,
air power has so immensely matured as a military tool that air
interdiction is now conceptually the equal of land and sea maneuver
_ something that soldiers and sailors do not like to admit.
</P>
<P>
   But second, the use of air power, although essential to success
in modern warfare, is not alone sufficient to ensure such success.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of problems associated with ground campaigns as
well, problems which have kept that option off the table so far in
this war.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of significant numbers of casualties and extremely
difficult terrain, as well as completely inadequate ports and
infrastructure for large land forces, give pause to all but the
most fervent advocates of a land solution.
</P>
<P>
   But it is precisely the shortcomings of single-dimensional
solutions that a truly joint campaign is designed to avoid. The
superb functioning and capabilities of allied air power, and the
enabling power of allied naval forces, makes adding land combat
power to the equation much less costly and much more effective.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the military aim focused primarily on the occupation of
Kosovo and the repatriation of refugees makes the operation more
achievable.
</P>
<P>
   This also makes an extensive Serbian guerrilla movement less
likely, since there are relatively few Serbian civilians in the
province to nurture a guerrilla resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Given that aim, NATO can leverage its overwhelming power to
protect the introduction of land forces, using all the tools
available: light infantry, armored, motorized, airborne, airmobile
and special forces, plus operational maneuver from the sea.
</P>
<P>
   That mix of forces, relying on massive air and naval power,
means substantially smaller land forces.
</P>
<P>
   Once introduced, the simple existence of land combat power (if
only in Albania, where it should have been deployed before the
first bomb was dropped) should force the Serbs to abandon some of
their passive defense measures such as spreading out their tanks in
ones and twos.
</P>
<P>
   As the concepts that are supposed to guide future U.S. military
operations stress, synchronized land maneuver and air interdiction
create an agonizing dilemma for opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Concentrating will brutally expose Serbian forces to heavier
losses from interdiction. But if they stay hunkered down, their
passive measures to reduce losses to interdiction mean they cannot
effectively counter allied surface maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   Single-dimensional operations are not the way it's supposed to
be done in the post-Gulf War era. It is not too late to start using
all the tools in NATO's bag. &QL;

 &HT;    AID AGENCIES: HUMANITARIAN EFFORT IN ALBANIA 'DISORGANIZED'
 &HT;    EDs: With optional trims.
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-CLINTON-0519
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TIRANA, ALBANIA _ Kosovar refugees in Albania are suffering
because of a disorganized relief effort, and many are exhausting
their life savings sustaining themselves, two international aid
groups said in reports issued Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   One aid agency, British-based Oxfam, said better coordination
between the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and aid agencies in
Albania and Macedonia is urgently needed to prevent the refugee
crisis from worsening.
</P>
<P>
   The UNHCR frequently has come under attack from aid workers in
the field, but the statement by Oxfam was a rare example of those
complaints taking the form of an official position.
</P>
<P>
   Oxfam said the agency has failed to provide adequate leadership
in coordinating the efforts by scores of relief organizations and
government agencies to build camps for the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our real worry is that the best use of all the goodwill and
resources is not being made and that is failing the refugees now
and possibly even more in the future,'' Oxfam spokesman John
</P>
<P>
   Sargent told Reuters News Agency in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   More than 744,000 refugees have fled Kosovo , according to the
UNHCR. Of those, 433,000 have come to Albania, while 229,300 have
gone to Macedonia. The balance is in Montenegro and
Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
   UNHCR numbers suggest that more than 300,000 of the refugees in
Albania are staying with host families or in other often ad hoc
arrangements. Another aid group said Tuesday that such families are
extremely vulnerable and in many cases are exhausting their life
savings paying exorbitant rents.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the middle of all the speeches about refugees, these people
feel alone and they will have to help themselves using their life's
savings while people make a profit on them,'' said William Perea, a
physician working with the French relief group Medicins Sans
Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders).
</P>
<P>
   In a survey of refugee conditions, MSF found that most refugees
are with host families, in collection centers waiting to be sent to
long-term camps or in makeshift camps on their own. In the border
town of Kukes, about 60 percent of the refugee families were paying
rent. The average cost was $137 monthly, a large sum for the
refugees, MSF said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin Optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The organization also determined that more than 60 percent of
the relatives missing from the families are males between the ages
of 15 and 54. About half of the missing men were said by their
families to have joined the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, or KLA.
The balance is unaccounted for. NATO officials have said they
suspect that Serb forces have been rounding up Kosovar fighting-age
men and in some cases executing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the refugees in Albania and Macedonia are to have a chance
at enjoying reasonable conditions, the U.N. refugee agency must
improve on its leadership. It is imperative for the success of the
aid effort that UNHCR is genuinely the lead agency and able to
function efficiently,'' Oxfam said in its report.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Ray Wilkinson, a UNHCR spokesman, acknowledged that the agency
was having difficulties managing the crisis. ``You have to have
organizations that want to be coordinated,'' he said. ``And you
can't be the lead organization if you don't have the funds. We are
at this moment officially broke.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the agency needs as much as $60 million to see it
through the next few weeks, while its donor base has failed to keep
up with demand.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson said the scope of the refugee crisis was beyond what
anyone had expected. ``This took UNHCR by surprise,'' he said.
``And it took everyone else by surprise too.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, British Prime Minister Tony Blair visited Tirana,
where he was greeted warmly by Albanian crowds and officials.
</P>
<P>
   Blair reassured Albanian officials that the West would remain
after the crisis to help Albania rebuild. ``I know well that it is
here that people have had to bear the burden of this crisis,'' he
said. ``Over 50 years ago, we had to rebuild Western Europe; now I
believe that this conflict can be a turning point in this region.
Now we can see here a new future in Albania, one of peace and
democracy and prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said the European alliance would not waiver in its
demands for ensuring the refugees return to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO has set out its demands,'' Blair said. ``Those demands
must be met. Simply, that (Yugoslav President Slobodan) Milosevic
take his troops out of Kosovo, that an international military force
go in and that the refugees return to their homes.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ As bombs rain down on ``strategic'' targets while
Serbian forces empty Kosovo, public opinion in Britain, France and
the United States largely approves NATO's ``air campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, many of those polled feel that a ``ground
campaign'' will eventually be required. Most defense experts in the
three countries mirror those conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Kosovo has a vocabulary problem. The terms ``air''
and ``ground'' seem to offer a classic choice of military options.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they offer incomplete choices, fail to reflect accepted
U.S. or NATO military concepts, and thus blur _ perhaps fatally _
the search for a military solution of NATO's current dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   The saying that hope is not a method expresses that dilemma. A
single-dimension strategy based on the use of force to ``signal''
and ``punish,'' instead of decisive force used in all dimensions to
compel, leaves only the hope that all will come out right.
</P>
<P>
   There is a better choice. The campaign which offers the surest,
and in the long run a less costly, way to accomplish the alliance's
political goals _ surer than the hope-to-win choice of an air-only
effort, and leaner than a ``ground campaign's'' hundreds of
thousands of troops _ is the one already embodied in the
war-fighting doctrine of NATO and the U.S. armed forces: a truly
joint campaign in all dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   In the joint U.S. and NATO military doctrine published after the
Gulf War, the term ``air campaign'' was deliberately never used.
</P>
<P>
   The Gulf War had made clear two things about air power. First,
air power has so immensely matured as a military tool that air
interdiction is now conceptually the equal of land and sea maneuver
_ something that soldiers and sailors do not like to admit.
</P>
<P>
   But second, the use of air power, although essential to success
in modern warfare, is not alone sufficient to ensure such success.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of problems associated with ground campaigns as
well, problems which have kept that option off the table so far in
this war.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of significant numbers of casualties and extremely
difficult terrain, as well as completely inadequate ports and
infrastructure for large land forces, give pause to all but the
most fervent advocates of a land solution.
</P>
<P>
   But it is precisely the shortcomings of single-dimensional
solutions that a truly joint campaign is designed to avoid. The
superb functioning and capabilities of allied air power, and the
enabling power of allied naval forces, makes adding land combat
power to the equation much less costly and much more effective.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the military aim focused primarily on the occupation of
Kosovo and the repatriation of refugees makes the operation more
achievable.
</P>
<P>
   This also makes an extensive Serbian guerrilla movement less
likely, since there are relatively few Serbian civilians in the
province to nurture a guerrilla resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Given that aim, NATO can leverage its overwhelming power to
protect the introduction of land forces, using all the tools
available: light infantry, armored, motorized, airborne, airmobile
and special forces, plus operational maneuver from the sea.
</P>
<P>
   That mix of forces, relying on massive air and naval power,
means substantially smaller land forces.
</P>
<P>
   Once introduced, the simple existence of land combat power (if
only in Albania, where it should have been deployed before the
first bomb was dropped) should force the Serbs to abandon some of
their passive defense measures such as spreading out their tanks in
ones and twos.
</P>
<P>
   As the concepts that are supposed to guide future U.S. military
operations stress, synchronized land maneuver and air interdiction
create an agonizing dilemma for opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Concentrating will brutally expose Serbian forces to heavier
losses from interdiction. But if they stay hunkered down, their
passive measures to reduce losses to interdiction mean they cannot
effectively counter allied surface maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   Single-dimensional operations are not the way it's supposed to
be done in the post-Gulf War era. It is not too late to start using
all the tools in NATO's bag. &QL;

HEXING ONE HECK OF A HIT STREAK 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PHOENIX - Those of us who migrated to the Southwest from
somewhat distant and, perhaps, more worldly regions of the country
have learned over time to accept and even appreciate the sometimes
raw, often quirky lack of sophistication we've encountered in our
new neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   How they say no to daylight-saving time, for instance. Or yes to
six-shooters. It's all part of the place's charm, its
guilelessness, its frontier innocence.
</P>
<P>
   But, there are limits.
</P>
<P>
   Even those of us willing to tolerate cactus jelly and string
ties can't idly stand by as the naivete of some Arizona residents
threatens the career and good fortune of another.
</P>
<P>
   I'm speaking, of course, about the reckless and irresponsible
babble surrounding the hitting streak of Arizona Diamondbacks left
fielder Luis Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   During the past week or so Gonzalez has been the subject of
innumerable television and newspaper reports about the streak, each
one giddily announcing the latest hit total.
</P>
<P>
   How could we do that to the man?
</P>
<P>
   Have we never learned that the only sure way to put an end to a
ballplayer's lucky streak is to talk about it?
</P>
<P>
   It's a hex, a spell, a sure-fire jinx.
</P>
<P>
   It is, in the parlance of my old neighborhood, very bad juju.
</P>
<P>
   This is why you never hear the words ``no-hitter'' spoken in a
dugout.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Historical reference &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Success in sports, like life, is dictated not only by skill and
smarts, but also by luck.
</P>
<P>
   In the year 1941, Ted Williams finished the season with a
batting average of .406, something no player in the league came
close to achieving that year or since. And yet, he wasn't voted the
league's Most Valuable Player.
</P>
<P>
   The award went to Joe DiMaggio, whose average was well below
Williams' but who'd managed, through talent and good fortune, to
string together a 56-game hitting streak.
</P>
<P>
   The streak finally ended when the nationwide frenzy over Joltin'
Joe's hitting put the whammy on it.
</P>
<P>
   Has history taught us nothing?
</P>
<P>
   I can tolerate a state that once elected a governor named Evan
Mecham, who thought pickaninny was an inoffensive word. The same
state in which one community recently elected a legislator named
Barbara Blewster, who says slavery wasn't so bad and Native
Americans aren't so smart.
</P>
<P>
   But a state that doesn't understand the implications of the evil
eye _ something my loving Italian grandmothers called (begin ital)
maloccio (end ital) _ cannot be ignored or glossed over.
</P>
<P>
   The possibilities are too frightening.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Guarded words &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Imagine what would happen if enough people walked outside during
this glorious spring and said, ``Have you noticed we haven't had
any really hot weather yet?''
</P>
<P>
   Three months in which the temperature doesn't drop below 110
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   At night.
</P>
<P>
   You know this.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, as you're driving down Central Avenue, you don't
say, ``Wow, I haven't hit a single red light yet!''
</P>
<P>
   It's why you don't say, ``Honey, we have the only kids in the
neighborhood who haven't gotten chickenpox.''
</P>
<P>
   It's why, around April 15, you never, ever hear a person say,
``There's no way I'd ever get audited.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm afraid it's too late for Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   If the streak hasn't been broken already, it will be soon.
</P>
<P>
   No amount of natural ability can compensate for the cumulative
effects of so much malevolent hoodoo.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the best way to wish Gonzalez well is (begin
ital) not (end ital) to wish him well.
</P>
<P>
   And then show the same indifference to the next ballplayer on a
hot streak.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't true of all professions.
</P>
<P>
   Good or bad luck doesn't affect newspaper writing, for instance.
Over the years, I've learned that a hack's success or lack of it is
determined by his insight, initiative and God-given talent. Nothing
else. For that reason, I've never once had to worry about having my
own work hexed.

   BRUSSELS _ A massacre on the road to Prizren, more than 100
civilians _ most of them ethnic Albanians _ torn apart in the
village of Korisa, stories of women and children ripped apart by
NATO cluster bombs.
</P>
<P>
   And how did NATO kick off their its o'clock follies Friday
afternoon? Without a single word about these frightful reports, not
a single bloody word of astonishment or compassion.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Jamie Shea and his Luftwaffe general droned on about
NATO's successful operations over Kosovo. ``They went very well,''
Luftwaffe Major General Walter Jertz informed us. ``It was another
very effective day of operations.''
</P>
<P>
   In Saigon, they had the five o'clock follies. In the 1991 Gulf
War, the Americans boasted of their military successes at the four
o'clock follies. In Brussels, NATO's follies start at three
o'clock.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, the Shea-Jertz show was theatre of the obscene.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as we all waited to hear NATO's reaction to what might
be its most terrible bloodbath to date (or Serbia's most successful
propaganda), a NATO technician projected a massive test slide onto
the screen next to the 19 flags of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say we're young and we don't know _ won't find out until
we grow,'' the words said on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Were these lines from the Sonny and Cher song supposed to be
gallows humor or just monumental ill-taste? The moment Shea and
Jertz walked to the podium, we knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still see no indications of a Serb ground force redeployal
(sic),'' Jertz announced. Forty tons of supplies had reached the
Red Cross at Pristina. ``I can assure you we will do everything
possible to ensure the safe passage of these convoys.''
</P>
<P>
   All of us in the darkened Joseph Luns auditorium at NATO
headquarters were holding our breath. Several journalists (the
television coverage never shows this, of course) shook their heads
in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   There had, it seemed, been no safe passage in Kosovo. We were
thinking of the first reports coming in _ of NATO cluster bombs
bursting amid 500 Albanian refugees, many of them children, of a
massacre that would make even the April Prizren-Djakovica slaughter
small-scale.
</P>
<P>
   We wanted to know about those who were young but would never
grow.
</P>
<P>
   But no, General Jertz of the Luftwaffe _ or the ``German Air
Force'' as we are for some reason encouraged to call it here _
wanted to tell us there had been 679 NATO missions over Yugoslavia
in 24 hours, that there had been attacks on oil refineries,
electricity stations, the Batajnica airfield.
</P>
<P>
   On the slide screen _ incredibly _ were projected the words ``A
GOOD DAY.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Shea launched into his usual denunciations of Serb
atrocities, exhuming some old pictures of alleged mass graves and
some (slightly) newer ones of burned villages.
</P>
<P>
   He quoted from old human-rights and newspaper articles and
managed to mispronounce the names of seven Kosovo villages. ``God
knows, frankly, what we are going to find when Kosovo is open,'' he
said, solemnly shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   God knows, I'm sure, what Shea was thinking; he was far more
frightened of what western journalists _ bussed to the scene by the
Serb authorities _ would find in the village of Korisa.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty tractors had been destroyed in the attack, the Serbs were
reporting, close to an area that had been the scene of sustained
NATO attack.
</P>
<P>
   It was, you see, significant that Shea had not mentioned _ had
not alluded for a second _ to these extraordinary reports. Had he
thought for a moment that the Serbs had slaughtered these people,
he would have told us all he knew. But he was silent.
</P>
<P>
   A colleague muttered in my ear that when Shea was asked about
the reported massacre, he would express no compassion for the dead
but ``promise another of his full and thorough investigations.''
</P>
<P>
   And when at last he was asked, Shea expressed no compassion for
the dead but promised ``a full and thorough investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   He hoped, he added sarcastically, that the journalists bussed to
the village by the Serbs would ``insist on their right to go around
freely and do their own research'' _ Shea is now apparently a
professor of journalism as well as a NATO flak _ and that they
would investigate ``ethnic cleansing'' in the nearby town of
Prizren.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know NATO _ we give the truth on these issues, every
single time, the full facts.''
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't. NATO does not give ``the full facts'' (or ``the
full fax'' as Shea keeps saying). It lies.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked for NATO's reaction to the KLA appointment of one
of the most notorious ethnic cleansers as its new military
commander _ Agim Ceku, one of the planners of Croatia's ethnic
cleansing of 300,000 Serbs in Krajina _ Shea said he had no comment
because ``NATO has no direct contact with the KLA.''
</P>
<P>
   This is totally untrue. NATO liaises with the KLA, holds
security and intelligence meetings with their commanders, maintains
radio contact with KLA men in Kosovo. NATO officials (including J.
Shea, Esq.) regularly announce KLA operations with approval. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (150-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 850) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And when I asked General Jertz if NATO was using depleted
uranium munitions in Serbia, he said that it had not done so for
two weeks but that depleted uranium is harmless.
</P>
<P>
   This, too, is a lie. There is growing evidence that the dust
from spent depleted uranium shells has caused an explosion of
cancers in southern Iraq and may well be a cause of Gulf War
syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   British weapons testing sights are meticulously washed down
after depleted uranium test-firings, their contents sealed in
concrete. Nothing to worry about, said the general.
</P>
<P>
   ``You find uranium in all sorts of things _ in rocks, soil...''
No harm could be caused by the use of such shells, Shea added. So
much for the deformed babies now being born in Basra.
</P>
<P>
   And so much, I suppose, for the contaminated homes of Kosovo to
which NATO claims it will return all of the Albanian refugees. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I kept wondering what this whole farce reminded me of. Here were
the two NATO men recording, minute after minute, hour after hour,
day after day, the destruction of the Kosovo population _ the fault
of the Serbs, to be sure, but the symbol nonetheless of NATO's
total, abject failure in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, they tell us about mass graves and death and torture.
And I recalled after a while what it all reminded me of _ the
discreet voices, the dipped lights, the flags hanging like dead
flowers behind the podium, even the sinister iron Death Star which
stands grimly outside NATO headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   It reminded me of an undertaker's office. The mock
soul-searching, the old pictures, the expressions of regret. The
cockney and the general were the morticians, as unable to
contemplate an end to NATO's bombardment of Serbia as they were to
arrest old age or find a cure for death.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo is dead. Its people are dead or dispossessed. For
investigation, read autopsy. And after a while it dawned on me as
it has dawned on others attending these preposterous gatherings: we
are being prepared for the death of NATO. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT _ In the dirt of the Sabra and Chatila Palestinian
refugee camp and in Mar Elias, they were not celebrating the
election victory of Israeli Ehud Barak Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Over the entrance to Mar Elias camp, with its open sewers and
old, worn water pipes running down the pavement, there hung an iron
map of Palestine: the original Palestine, Haifa as well as
Ramallah, Tel Aviv as well as Nablus, Jerusalem as well as Jericho,
the whole shebang. And they are not going to get it back.
</P>
<P>
   They would like _ the Palestinians who live among the garbage
here _ to have the same ``right of return'' that U.S. President
Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair have promised to
the Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton and Blair did not intend their promise to apply to
the Palestinians from Haifa and the rest of that part of Palestine
that became Israel in 1948 (nor do they want them to return there).
</P>
<P>
   And when you enter the grotty concrete hovel where Suheil Natour
holds forth, you can see how enormous is the chasm that divides CNN
from reality, which separates ``peace hopes'' from peace _ which
makes Ehud Barak's election a mere footnote to catastrophe for the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The differences between the Likud and Labor are minor,'' the
spokesman for the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labor wants the annexation of 52 percent of the West Bank,
Likud wanted 64 percent _ this is the difference for the
Palestinians.'' Which, for the dispossessed, for the 4 million
Palestinians of the diaspora, is all that matters.
</P>
<P>
   True, Barak wants peace. But everyone wants peace; the
Palestinians and the Israelis. Yet Barak has said that he will not
cede the Arab quarter of Jerusalem to Palestine. So what hope for
Palestine?
</P>
<P>
   It may be peace of a kind that the electorate of Israel has
voted for. But it is not peace in our time.
</P>
<P>
   The Arab world _ the supine, humiliated Arab dictatorships whose
leaders have pleaded for Washington's love and support and money _
welcomed the Labor leader's victory in the Israeli elections.
</P>
<P>
   Out came Egypt's familiar ``hand of peace'' (and oh, if only
President Hosni Mubarak would hold the same kind of free elections
which Israel conducts).
</P>
<P>
   ``Egypt is ready to cooperate with the new Israeli prime
minister to revive the peace process and to change the general
atmosphere in the region which was extremely poisoned over the last
three years,'' the Egyptian foreign minister, Amr Moussa, said.
</P>
<P>
   And from Jordan _ whose Plucky Little King II has prayed for
Benjamin Netanyahu's defeat _ came equally familiar words.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully,'' the deputy prime minister, Ayman Majali said,
``we will witness a serious move on the peace process, on the
Palestinian-Israeli track and on the Syrian-Israeli and Lebanese
tracks and hopefully we will witness a serious move for a
comprehensive, just and durable peace in the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   But note the double ``hopefully'' and the reference to a
``just'' peace. And the use of the American phrase ``tracks.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, the Israelis have been trying to divide the Arabs
into these different tracks. The Palestinians fear Barak will do
just the same.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Yasser Arafat joined in the applause. ``I respect the
choice of this democratic election,'' he said without missing a
heartbeat when he used the word ``democratic'' _ that quality which
Arafat's Palestine so miserably lacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give my best wishes to Barak,'' Arafat chimed.
</P>
<P>
   In the Gulf, many a sheikh will be breathing a similar sigh of
relief. Now that the awful Netanyahu has gone, they can deal with
the nice Barak. Just like that.
</P>
<P>
   But history _ especially Palestinian history _ does not work
like that. If there is to be a Palestinian state _ the only hope
for a real peace _ then the Palestinians will have to have a
capital in part of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   They will have to see an end to occupation, an end to the theft
of Arab land and the continued building of Jewish settlements on
Arab land, an end to the confiscation of Palestinian identity
papers, an end to the demolition of Arab homes.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has promised none of this. Indeed, he may be more
interested in making a peace overture to Syria and Lebanon rather
than Palestine, in leaving Arafat to suffocate for awhile longer in
his Gaza dunghill as the Palestinian leader's popularity sinks even
lower.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? Syria still demands, consistently, the return of
the occupied Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   President Hafez Assad had held out (in Syria's negotiations with
the Rabin-Peres Labor government) for a withdrawal of Israeli
troops to the borders of June 4, 1967, a frontier which would give
Damascus that part of Golan which Arafat considers Palestine, the
bit which is the source of water _ the Middle East's gold.
</P>
<P>
   Rabin refused. Barak may accept. So goodbye, Arafat would
conclude, to another bit of Palestine. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (350-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 850) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, a peace with Syria would allow Israel to withdraw
from the cauldron of Lebanon _ ``unconditionally,'' according to
U.N. Security Council Resolution 425, though Barak may have other
ideas _ and save its soldiers from the increasing attacks of
Hezbollah guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has promised to be out of Lebanon in a year. But on the
ground, where it always matters in the Middle East, things do not
seem that easy.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday (don't look for the news reports because it went
unmentioned) Israeli shellfire killed two civilians in the Lebanese
town of Nabatea. The Hezbollah retaliated with Katyusha rockets
into Galilee (wounding Israeli civilians, which did not go
unreported).
</P>
<P>
   And this week the Lebanese resistance movement displayed in
Beirut an entire armored personnel carrier _ captured from Israel's
surrogate ``South Lebanon Army'' militia in southern Lebanon over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the Middle East has changed since Benjamin
Netanyahu came to power in Israel three years ago. President
Mohamed Khatami of Iran _ elected democratically with a far more
devastating popular vote than Barak _ has been meeting King Fahd of
Saudi Arabia after visiting President Assad in Damascus.
</P>
<P>
   For Iran is no longer the pariah of the region, feared by those
Gulf Arabs who so eagerly invited American troops to their
peninsula when Iraqi president Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait and
became the greatest threat to the region since the last greatest
threat.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranians are now talking of a ``strong regional alliance''
between Tehran and the Arab Gulf. And they have reason to do so.
</P>

 By ROBERT FISK  
 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT _ In the dirt of the Sabra and Chatila Palestinian
refugee camp and in Mar Elias, they were not celebrating the
election victory of Israeli Ehud Barak Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Over the entrance to Mar Elias camp, with its open sewers and
old, worn water pipes running down the pavement, there hung an iron
map of Palestine: the original Palestine, Haifa as well as
Ramallah, Tel Aviv as well as Nablus, Jerusalem as well as Jericho,
the whole shebang. And they are not going to get it back.
</P>
<P>
   They would like _ the Palestinians who live among the garbage
here _ to have the same ``right of return'' that U.S. President
Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair have promised to
the Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton and Blair did not intend their promise to apply to
the Palestinians from Haifa and the rest of that part of Palestine
that became Israel in 1948 (nor do they want them to return there).
</P>
<P>
   And when you enter the grotty concrete hovel where Suheil Natour
holds forth, you can see how enormous is the chasm that divides CNN
from reality, which separates ``peace hopes'' from peace _ which
makes Ehud Barak's election a mere footnote to catastrophe for the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The differences between the Likud and Labor are minor,'' the
spokesman for the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labor wants the annexation of 52 percent of the West Bank,
Likud wanted 64 percent _ this is the difference for the
Palestinians.'' Which, for the dispossessed, for the 4 million
Palestinians of the diaspora, is all that matters.
</P>
<P>
   True, Barak wants peace. But everyone wants peace; the
Palestinians and the Israelis. Yet Barak has said that he will not
cede the Arab quarter of Jerusalem to Palestine. So what hope for
Palestine?
</P>
<P>
   It may be peace of a kind that the electorate of Israel has
voted for. But it is not peace in our time.
</P>
<P>
   The Arab world _ the supine, humiliated Arab dictatorships whose
leaders have pleaded for Washington's love and support and money _
welcomed the Labor leader's victory in the Israeli elections.
</P>
<P>
   Out came Egypt's familiar ``hand of peace'' (and oh, if only
President Hosni Mubarak would hold the same kind of free elections
which Israel conducts).
</P>
<P>
   ``Egypt is ready to cooperate with the new Israeli prime
minister to revive the peace process and to change the general
atmosphere in the region which was extremely poisoned over the last
three years,'' the Egyptian foreign minister, Amr Moussa, said.
</P>
<P>
   And from Jordan _ whose Plucky Little King II has prayed for
Benjamin Netanyahu's defeat _ came equally familiar words.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully,'' the deputy prime minister, Ayman Majali said,
``we will witness a serious move on the peace process, on the
Palestinian-Israeli track and on the Syrian-Israeli and Lebanese
tracks and hopefully we will witness a serious move for a
comprehensive, just and durable peace in the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   But note the double ``hopefully'' and the reference to a
``just'' peace. And the use of the American phrase ``tracks.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, the Israelis have been trying to divide the Arabs
into these different tracks. The Palestinians fear Barak will do
just the same.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Yasser Arafat joined in the applause. ``I respect the
choice of this democratic election,'' he said without missing a
heartbeat when he used the word ``democratic'' _ that quality which
Arafat's Palestine so miserably lacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give my best wishes to Barak,'' Arafat chimed.
</P>
<P>
   In the Gulf, many a sheikh will be breathing a similar sigh of
relief. Now that the awful Netanyahu has gone, they can deal with
the nice Barak. Just like that.
</P>
<P>
   But history _ especially Palestinian history _ does not work
like that. If there is to be a Palestinian state _ the only hope
for a real peace _ then the Palestinians will have to have a
capital in part of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   They will have to see an end to occupation, an end to the theft
of Arab land and the continued building of Jewish settlements on
Arab land, an end to the confiscation of Palestinian identity
papers, an end to the demolition of Arab homes.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has promised none of this. Indeed, he may be more
interested in making a peace overture to Syria and Lebanon rather
than Palestine, in leaving Arafat to suffocate for awhile longer in
his Gaza dunghill as the Palestinian leader's popularity sinks even
lower.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? Syria still demands, consistently, the return of
the occupied Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   President Hafez Assad had held out (in Syria's negotiations with
the Rabin-Peres Labor government) for a withdrawal of Israeli
troops to the borders of June 4, 1967, a frontier which would give
Damascus that part of Golan which Arafat considers Palestine, the
bit which is the source of water _ the Middle East's gold.
</P>
<P>
   Rabin refused. Barak may accept. So goodbye, Arafat would
conclude, to another bit of Palestine. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (350-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 850) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, a peace with Syria would allow Israel to withdraw
from the cauldron of Lebanon _ ``unconditionally,'' according to
U.N. Security Council Resolution 425, though Barak may have other
ideas _ and save its soldiers from the increasing attacks of
Hezbollah guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has promised to be out of Lebanon in a year. But on the
ground, where it always matters in the Middle East, things do not
seem that easy.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday (don't look for the news reports because it went
unmentioned) Israeli shellfire killed two civilians in the Lebanese
town of Nabatea. The Hezbollah retaliated with Katyusha rockets
into Galilee (wounding Israeli civilians, which did not go
unreported).
</P>
<P>
   And this week the Lebanese resistance movement displayed in
Beirut an entire armored personnel carrier _ captured from Israel's
surrogate ``South Lebanon Army'' militia in southern Lebanon over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the Middle East has changed since Benjamin
Netanyahu came to power in Israel three years ago. President
Mohamed Khatami of Iran _ elected democratically with a far more
devastating popular vote than Barak _ has been meeting King Fahd of
Saudi Arabia after visiting President Assad in Damascus.
</P>
<P>
   For Iran is no longer the pariah of the region, feared by those
Gulf Arabs who so eagerly invited American troops to their
peninsula when Iraqi president Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait and
became the greatest threat to the region since the last greatest
threat.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranians are now talking of a ``strong regional alliance''
between Tehran and the Arab Gulf. And they have reason to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The Arab kings and emirs are tired of America's crusade against
Iraq and its sanctions-cull of Iraqi children.
</P>
<P>
   They are weary of Washington's vacillation in the face of
Israel's refusal to abide by the American ``peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   They are distrustful of an America which demands obedience to
U.N. resolutions from Arabs but none from Israel.

RUSSIA SCHOLARS FAULT CLINTON ADMINISTRATION POLICY IN YUGOSLAVIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S.-led bombing of Yugoslavia is fanning a
nationalist backlash across Russia that could imperil the future of
democracy there, three Russia scholars, led by Librarian of
Congress James Billington, warned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Billington, joined by Mark Kramer, a Russia studies specialist
at Harvard University, and Michael McFaul, a specialist on Russian
politics at Stanford University, said U.S. strategy in Kosovo is
alienating the next generation of Russian leaders, bolstering
ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky and imperiling the chances
that a pragmatic, pro-western regime would win Russia's
presidential elections in June 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The allied bombing plays into the hands of Russian nationalists
who argue that the West is trying to exploit Russia's economic and
military weakness by attacking on Russia's doorstep in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks come on the heels of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization's expansion into former Warsaw Pact territory that
once served as a buffer for the former Soviet Union to recruit
Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary as new members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having won the Cold War and having emerged as the only
superpower, I think the United States is in serious danger of
losing this older more basic conflict _ the struggle between
democracy and tyranny,'' Billington told a conference sponsored by
the United States Institute of Peace, a unit of the U.S.
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No. 1 foreign policy concern in my view for American
interests should be the future of the core country within the
former Soviet empire,'' Billington said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia is being treated largely as a secondary or even a third
echelon problem on the world scene,'' added Billington, a veteran
Russia scholar who taught at Harvard and Princeton universities
before being named Librarian of Congress, one of the most
prestigious scholarly posts in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Billington said U.S.-led attacks on Yugoslavia in a bid to force
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to accept an allied peace
plan for Kosovo raise the likelihood that Russia will revert to
``authoritarian nationalism,'' at least in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   Billington forecast a ``Pinochet interlude'' in which Russia
could temporarily turn to an authoritarian regime before embarking
anew on a path toward democracy and free enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Billington said he was referring to the 1973 coup in Chile led
by Gen. Augusto Pinochet who seized power from popularly elected
Marxist Salvador Allende. Pinochet then governed Chile ruthlessly
until voters elected a civilian president in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Billington's bleak assessment was echoed by McFaul and Kramer.
</P>
<P>
   McFaul said Russians' antipathy to allied attacks in Kosovo has
transformed public opinion at the grass roots level.
</P>
<P>
   Among Russians aged 18 to 35 _ the next generation of Russian
leaders _ 67 percent now have a negative view of the United States
and only 18 percent have a positive view _ a complete turnabout in
attitudes in just two years, McFaul said.
</P>
<P>
   The Stanford scholar, leading the Russia domestic politics
project at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in
Washington, D.C., said NATO attacks on Yugoslavia are enabling
Russian ultra-nationalists to gain enough popularity to meet the
minimum threshold for party representation in the Russian Duma in
the Dec. 19 parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zhirinovsky is the big winner,'' McFaul said.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer, who directs Harvard's project on Cold War Studies, said
Russian nationalists are portraying the bombing of Yugoslavia and
NATO expansion as long suspected encroachments on Russian spheres
of influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``These developments are creating the general sense that Russia
is being encroached upon,'' Kramer said.
</P>
<P>
   The scholars suggested that the Clinton administration could
still help Russia avert a catastrophic return to an authoritarian
regime by launching bold steps such as bringing 10,000 Russian
students to the United States each year to study.
</P>
<P>
   Billington suggested launching a multibillion dollar
U.S.-Russian project in Siberia that would produce sorely needed
products for the Russian market. Critics in Russia complain that
much of the foreign investment is directed at extraction of energy
resources such as oil and gas _ products that are exported abroad.

   ``We have done nothing dramatic to respond to the Russians' time
of troubles,'' Billington said. ``The Russians see us as the land
of big things. We have done very little.''
</P>
<P>
   The scholars' bleak assessment about the future of democracy in
Russia was challenged by former U.S. Ambassador Arthur Hartman, who
represented the Reagan administration in Moscow in the 1980s and
now leads an investment fund with Russian entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chicken Little debate is far from the truth,'' Hartman
declared. ``The sky is not falling over there. People are not out
in the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartman noted that the Russian parliament debated the
impeachment of Russian President Boris Yeltsin within the
provisions of the post-Soviet constitution without resorting to
force.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, the first popularly elected Russian leader in the
nation's 1,000 year history, is due to complete his second term and
turn power over to the winner of the presidential election in June
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, who fought back a communist-led effort to impeach him
on five charges earlier this week, is hoping to win Duma
confirmation of Prime minister-designate Sergei Stepashin on
Wednesday.

   In a related development, the National Research Council issued a

with Russia for at least another decade to help secure
weapons-grade nuclear materials.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In his wheelchair up on the stage at the 92nd Street
Y on Monday night, Reynolds Price read his poem about a friend who
dreamed that Price could walk again.
</P>
<P>
   Rita Dove read ``Rosa,'' about Rosa Parks:
</P>
<P>
   ``How she sat there,
</P>
<P>
   the time right inside a place
</P>
<P>
   so wrong it was ready.''
</P>
<P>
   They were celebrating the the 60th anniversary of the Y's
Unterberg Poetry Center. Stanley Kunitz, who began coming to the Y
in 1958, looked fit at 93 as he read ``The Layers,'' about the
deaths of old friends:
</P>
<P>
   ``How shall the heart be reconciled
</P>
<P>
   to its feast of losses?
</P>
<P>
   In a rising wind
</P>
<P>
   the manic dust of my friends,
</P>
<P>
   those who fell along the way,
</P>
<P>
   bitterly stings my face.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Albee, Tony Kushner and Grace Paley were there, too on
the stage of Kaufmann Hall, under the sober frieze with the names
of Beethoven, Jefferson, Shakespeare and Dante written in gold
leaf. Since the center's founding in 1939, Kaufmann Hall, a
templelike place with wood-paneled walls, has had a central
position in the life of poetry in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clearest index of a culture's moral health, the most
immediate register of its language's resources, both are provided
by poetry,'' the center's director, Karl Kirchwey, said in opening
remarks at the celebration. ``Why, then, should poetry be banished
to a lyric or an academic ghetto?''
</P>
<P>
   The idea that poetry has a salutary purpose is at the core of
the center' mission as a place, in the words of its founder, Dr.
William Kolodney, ``to meet the needs of the very few persons in
New York to whom poetry offers the theological, the ethical and the
esthetic equivalents of traditional religion.''
</P>
<P>
   For young poets, giving a reading at the Y has always been a
little like getting into Harvard, and the audience tends to be
severe, prosperous-looking, attentive. ``A grave-looking literary
crowd, frowning in advance of what they were about to hear,'' John
Irving wrote in his novel ``A Widow for One Year,'' in which he
sets a scene at the center. Waiting for the writer to appear, he
wrote, the crowd makes its impatient presence felt ``like a large,
restless animal in a cage.'' The average size of the audience is
about 500 subscribers and single-ticket holders.
</P>
<P>
   Gwendolyn Brooks, Allen Ginsberg, Elizabeth Bishop, Robert
Lowell and Richard Wilbur all read at the Y early in their careers.
And through an award program with The Nation magazine, the center
has showcased the poetry of Lucille Clifton and Mark Strand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The return of the oral tradition is due largely to the work of
the Y and to those who have followed in its footsteps,'' Kunitz
said in an interview before the celebration.
</P>
<P>
   The Y also holds writers' workshops and a ``Writers at Work
Live'' series, in which authors are interviewed onstage. Over the
years the center has expanded to offer ``The Tenth Muse,'' a
reading series for experimental poets, who are sometimes introduced
by older distinguished writers. The poetry readings are
co-sponsored with the Academy of American Poets. The Unterberg
Poetry Center, named for a family of donors to its activities, now
has a schools project and a program for adult literacy.
</P>
<P>
   But the poetry center is not just for poets. Mary McCarthy read
from the manuscript of her novel ``The Group'' at the center. Her
friend Hannah Arendt was in the audience at the Y, Ms. McCarthy
once recalled: ``She said, `How are you going to end it?' I told
her I didn't know, and she said: `You begin with a wedding. You
should end with a funeral.' And that's what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Dylan Thomas' play ``Under Milk Wood'' had its first New York
performance there in 1953. Alternately shaking with cold and
burning with fever, Thomas, who was an alcoholic, added new scenes
up to the last minute. John Malcolm Brinnin, then the center's
director, wrote in ``Dylan Thomas in America'' that at a reading of
the play, ``conscious of the whiteness of Dylan's sick face as it
showed through all the lights focused upon it, I could hear, above
the music of his voice, `I have seen the gates of hell.''' Thomas
died shortly after.
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol has been a theme in the center's life. Dorothy Parker
was so inebriated when she appeared that she read her work aloud,
bowed to the applause, and then read the whole thing again.
Theodore Roethke was also drunk when he made his last appearance
there. Still, his friend Kunitz remembered, Roethke ``gave a great
reading, dancing like a bear onstage, roaring like a lion.''
</P>
<P>
   The poetry center has been a setting for battles over free
speech. In 1961 Norman Mailer, out on bail after stabbing his wife,
announced he was going to read ``very bad poems,'' some of them
obscene. Mailer said that would just make the audience appreciate
good poetry more.
</P>
<P>
   But Kolodney called Mailer's work ``not poems at all'' but
``obscenity for obscenity's sake'' and rang the down the curtain.
Ginsberg, who had been in the audience, wrote to Kolodney
protesting, ``I place my Spirit as poet working in an ancient
prophetic tradition against yours.'' He demanded an apology for the
treatment of Mailer, otherwise, ``I will not again set foot in the
Temple of the Y because it is a place of Pharisees and money
changers.''
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time another poet, Frederick Seidel, ran into
difficulty. Seidel was 23, and a panel of judges _ Louise Bogan,
Kunitz and Robert Lowell _ had selected him for the center's
1961-62 Helen Burlin Memorial Award. But the president of the Y's
board thought that Seidel's poem ``American in Rome'' libeled
Cardinal Francis Spellman, and asked the poet to change it. Seidel
refused and turned the prize down. The judges resigned in protest,
as did Elizabeth Kray, the center director. For years afterward,
Ms. Bogan, Kunitz and Lowell refused to appear at the center.
</P>
<P>
   As important as poetry is to the Y, the social setting is, too.
It is a place to see and be seen: in the audience, in the lobby and
at receptions after the readings. Poets see one another and
editors. Contacts are made that lead to publication, teaching jobs,
even literary romances.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981 the writer Siri Hustvedt, then a Columbia University
graduate student, attended a reading by Ann Lauterbach and Hayden
Carruth. After the reading, coming out into the lobby, Ms. Hustvedt
caught sight of the novelist Paul Auster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw this very beautiful guy standing there smoking a
cigarette and wearing a leather jacket,'' Ms. Hustvedt said the
other day. ``The myth in our family is that I fell in love in 30
seconds, and it took Paul several hours.'' They later married.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have very tender feelings about the Y,'' Ms. Hustvedt said.

U.S., MEXICO BLAME EACH OTHER FOR ILLEGAL DRUG TRADE, POLL FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Mexicans blame the United States for the illegal
drug flow across the two nations' border and say the North American
Free Trade Agreement has benefited Americans much more than people
in their country, according to a Louis Harris survey released
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   However, a second Harris survey of U.S. citizens showed that
they took exactly the opposite view, blaming Mexicans for illegal
drugs crossing the border and feeling that NAFTA is helping Mexico
and hurting the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that Mexicans and Americans look at their
relationship from two very different perspectives,'' said Humphrey
Taylor, chairman of Louis Harris and Associates Inc., a New
York-based polling company.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the 4,500 Mexican adults surveyed between April 23 and
May 3 said drug usage by Americans is the primary cause of the
illegal narcotics flow across the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case, Mexicans feel there wouldn't even be any drug
lords if the United States wasn't buying their products,'' Humphrey
said.
</P>
<P>
   But in a separate poll of 1,006 American adults between April 8
and April 13, 48 percent said Mexico was more to blame for not
arresting Mexican traffickers and closing down their drug business.
About 4 in 10 said the United States was more to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans and Americans also took opposite views of NAFTA, the
1994 trade pact that sought to eliminate all trade barriers between
Canada, Mexico and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three out of four Mexicans surveyed said the trade
agreement has been good for the United States while only 43 percent
said it was also helping Mexico. In the United States, 57 percent
of those asked said NAFTA was good for Mexico and only 39 percent
thought it had benefited Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the issues of drugs and NAFTA, the Mexican survey
also sought to gauge other Mexican attitudes toward the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The results showed that the poll participants often took a
negative view of their northern neighbor, Humphrey said. Among the
findings were:
</P>
<P>
   _ Seven of every 10 Mexicans surveyed said their country ``has
been treated unfairly'' by the U.S. government in the last three or
four years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fewer than a quarter of the poll participants thought
President Clinton is a ``friend'' of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   _ Half of those surveyed believed the American government treats
Mexicans who are legal U.S. residents unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   _ More than 80 percent of poll participants also said the U.S.
government gives unfair treatment to Mexicans who are caught
illegally crossing into the United States or who are living
illegally in this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, many Mexicans believe that the border should not
exist at all, that it's illegal, and, therefore, Mexicans should be
allowed to cross without any conditions,'' Vicente Licona, head of
Harris' Mexico City office, said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   He said many Mexicans view the border as illegal because they
feel the United States stole much of the Southwest from their
country after the Mexican-American War. Under the Treaty of
Guadalupe Hidalgo, which ended the war in 1848, the United States
purchased nearly half of Mexico's territory _ including California,
Nevada, Utah and most of Arizona and parts of New Mexico, Colorado
and Wyoming _ for $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   Both the U.S. and Mexican polls have a margin of error of plus
or minus 3 percentage points.

 &HT;    OPPONENTS RENEW THEIR ATTACK ON SUGAR SUPPORT PROGRAM
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By SUE SCHULTZ

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the fourth year in a row, lawmakers opposed to
the federal sugar program introduced legislation Tuesday that would
phase it out over three years. They said it would give a break to
taxpayers, consumers and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through price supports, the sugar program keeps the price of
sugar in the United States artificially high,'' said Rep. Dan
Miller, R-Fla., who has led the effort in the past.
</P>
<P>
   A similar bill will be introduced in the Senate by Sens. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y. and Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a special interest program that benefits a handful of
sugar barons at the expense of every man, woman, and child in
America,'' said Schumer, who co-sponsored previous bills with
Miller when he served in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the sugar program chided the sponsors for
continuing to offer legislation that has previously been rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting rid of the program will neither help the Everglades
nor save one penny for consumers, and the House has long understood
that,'' said Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each year this proposal is offered, it has been defeated by
ever larger numbers,'' Foley said. ``I wish they would put as much
energy behind saving family farmers as they have in trying to kill
off the farms.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, as part of the major farm bill reauthorization,
the House came within nine votes of eliminating the sugar program.
Last year, the margin was 91 votes.
</P>
<P>
   The bill by Miller and Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., would
reduce the sugar program's loan rate by one cent a pound each year,
from the current level of 18 cents a pound to 14 cents a pound by
2002, and eliminate it after that.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also instructs the president and secretary of
agriculture to adjust import levels, now restricted to assure that
prices remain above the loan rate, to assure an adequate supply of
sugar.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. sugar program makes no sense,'' said Rep. George
Miller. ``Consumers pay a billion dollars more in food prices than
they should, thousands of sugar refinery workers have lost their
jobs, and the precious Florida environment is trampled.''
</P>
<P>
   Dalton Yancey, a representative for Florida Sugar Cane League,
said the proposed bill would have a significant national impact on
sugar cane and sugar beet farmers. Yancey added that reducing the
prices for sugar producers would not necessarily mean lower prices
for consumers at the grocery stores.

CHILTEPINE CHILI SECURES HOT SPOT IN NATIONAL FOREST  
 (ADV: CHARTABLE MATERIAL AT END) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS ROPP  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUMACACORI, Ariz. - It's no bigger than a pea, but the
diminutive chiltepine chili unleashes a hellfire in the mouth that
makes eyes cross and knees buckle.
</P>
<P>
   Now the searing red-hot mother of all chilies is packing some
serious heat in the political arena. After nearly a decade of
cajoling by ethnobotanists and conservationists, the U.S. Forest
Service has agreed to set aside a wilderness reserve in southern
Arizona to protect a rare U.S. stand of wild chiltepines, which
grow in the Coronado National Forest about 50 miles south of
Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   The 4-square-mile chili reserve, expected to be dedicated in
early June, will be the first of its kind set aside on national
forest land, said Suzanne Nelson of Tucson, the reserve project's
director and director of conservation for Native Seeds/SEARCH, a
Tucson-based seed conservation organization.
</P>
<P>
   Why all the hubbub over a chili?
</P>
<P>
   Besides their use in salsas and other foods, chiltepines
(pronounced CHILL-ta-peens) contain an intriguing compound called
capsaicin, found mainly in the seed. It's what gives most hot
peppers their fiery nature. However, scientists have discovered
that capsaicin may also be a potent insecticide and could have
significant medical applications for treating indigestion,
arthritis and mouth cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we lose the chiltepine we could miss out on even more
uses,'' Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   The chiltepine is an old plant known to Incas, Aztecs and
Mayans. It's the wild relative of virtually all our common
commercial peppers, including bell peppers, jalapenos and serranos.
While common in Latin America, the southern Arizona stand of
chiltepines represents its northernmost range.
</P>
<P>
   Chili and capsaicin researcher Joshua Tewksbury of the
University of Montana in Missoula, said the reserve offers
scientists an opportunity to study the ``evolutionary forces'' that
have created the heat in chilies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Capsaicin does some bizarre things,'' Tewksbury said. ``It
hooks onto our nerve endings in some way that we sense heat (begin
ital) without (end ital) heat. It's a novel chemical in that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Tewksbury is especially interested in how capsaicin and birds
interact. While irritating (and even deadly) to mammals, capsaicin
appears to have no effect on birds. In fact, Tewksbury believes
birds are primarily responsible for distributing its seeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some birds even prefer these chilies over fruit,'' Tewksbury
said. ``In Mexico they call thrashers chileros. People find chilies
this way by tracking the birds to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Birdseed may someday be treated with capsaicin to discourage
squirrels from looting bird feeders, Tewksbury believes.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers estimate about 1,000 plants grow in the small area
of Santa Cruz County known as Rock Corral Canyon. The plants thrive
in a 3,000-foot enclave among mesquite trees along a basin of
sculpted volcanic rock below the Tumacacori Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   It's a peaceful place where hawks glide on strong afternoon
winds and rainbow cactus light up the rocks with enormous lavender
blooms. There are more cattle here than humans. The road from the
interstate to the chiltepines is only a few miles, but requires a
four-wheel drive.
</P>
<P>
   However, it's unlikely you could find the chiltepines anyway.
They are small scrubby bushes that grow under larger nursery plants
like hackberry trees for protection from sun and frost. Leafing and
fruiting are initiated by summer rains.
</P>
<P>
   Just a handful of miles south in adjacent Sonora, rapid declines
in chiltepines have been reported, Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something we've been working on for a long time,''
Nelson said. ``This marks the first time the Forest Service has set
aside land solely for the conservation and management of a wild
relative of a domesticated crop.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Chiltepine facts &QL; 
For more than 8,000 years, chiltepines have grown in Peru, the
Caribbean, Mexico and isolated pockets in the Southwest. &QL; 
Native American women rubbed chiltepine powder on their nipples to
wean babies. Incas burned them to create noxious smoke as
protection against invaders. &QL; 
Scientists measure chili pepper heat in Scoville units. Green
peppers contain no Scoville units. Jalapenos in salsa range from
1,000 to 10,000 Scoville units. Chiltepines are rated at 75,000
Scoville units. &QL; 
The first chilies appeared as tiny wild berries that grew on vines
in the Amazon jungle. It's believed that birds, immune to the
chilies' heat, gobbled up the berries and distributed the seeds. &QL; 
Harvesters known as chiltepineros pick about 30 tons of chiltepines
a year for salsa and various medicinal purposes. &QL;

   ENCRYPTION _ WASHINGTON _ A House subcommittee hears from
Microsoft, FBI and the National Security Agency on export controls
and recommendations of the proposed SAFE Act, a measure to limit
data encryption that the industry bitterly opposes. The battle pits
personal privacy concerns against rising use of the Internet by
criminals and spies. (Glass, Cox News Service) ETA: 6 p.m.

<P>
   HOMEDEPOT-EARNINGS _ ATLANTA _ Home Depot Inc., the largest
retailer of home-improvement products, said fiscal first-quarter
profit rose a more-than-expected 45 percent as home sales fueled
demand for flooring, paint and other remodeling supplies. Net
income rose to $489 million, or 32 cents a share, from $337
million, or 22 cents, a year earlier. Home Depot was expected to
earn 28 cents, the average estimate of analysts polled by First
Call Corp. for the period ended May 2. (Bond, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   BELLSOUTH-CABLE _ ATLANTA _ BellSouth wireless cable TV has all
the business it can handle. The company is scrambling to service
every call it gets for it cable tv service but it's still having to
turn away many would be customers. However, mastering this market
is is must if BellSouth is to be a contender in the coming market
of bundled media services including phone, Internet access and
cable TV. (Kanell, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   SATELLITE-TV _ ATLANTA _ Satellite TV which plateaued for a
while in local market penetration is on the upswing again.
Consumers dissatified with their local cable provider are drawn to
Direct TV and other satellite service providers who offer up to 150
channels. However, satellite TV's record is much less satisfactory
in the area of Internet access but all that may change with new
technology. (Haddad, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   SECURITY-FIRST _ Profile of Security First, an Atlanta company
that just announced a billion-dollar acquisition and an infusion of
$50 million from Intuit. Security First makes software that allows
banks to set up Internet banking for consumers, the wave of the
future. (Clothier, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   IXL-IPO _ The latest Internet IPO should happen during the week
of May 17 When iXL Enterprises goes public. Starting price is
expected to be $10-12, but should rise quickly, although analysts
say the company is as yet little more than a random collection of
Internet services. (Katz, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   MONEYTALK _ Attention brides and grooms: Almost every married
couple fights about money. Among couples who don't fight, one
partner often seethes while the other spends. Money management is
one of those little things that people don't necessarily warn their
children about. A recent survey showed another factor: Only one
young person in every five has taken a course in personal finance,
and one of every six thinks that avoiding money problems is mostly
a matter of luck. Money is a natural thing to argue about. It's
important to our happiness, sometimes crucial to self-esteem and
always in short supply. Wise young people can minimize conflicts by
following some fairly simple guidelines. (Ezell, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

<P>
   PRERUNNER _ Car shoppers who think of the venerable Honda Civic
as a bastion of practical and reliable _ but unexciting _
transportation are going to be surprised by the new Civic Si. The
car is a truly worthy successor of the recently departed CRX and
the Si models of the early and mid-1980s. (DeVault, Atlanta

1999 Honda Civic Si.

   WITH: SHARP DRIVING _ Cars are not the only inhabitants of our
roadways. Pedestrians also share our streets and with the weather
getting warmer and days longer, we can expect to see more people
out walking and exercising. Here are a few suggestions to improve
the safety on our roads. (Carter, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   SHARP-DRIVING _ ATLANTA _ If having it all is what a true
premium luxury car is really all about, then Mercedes-Benz's
S-Class may be on a page by itself. The totally new body design
2000 S-Class boasts one of the most extensive lists of safety,
performance, comfort and convenience features. (Sharp, Atlanta

 A SIXTH NIGHT FOR WB, FOR UNDER-35's ONLY  
 (bl)  
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Continuing its campaign to dominate the television habits of
people under 35, the WB network announced an expansion Tuesday to
six nights a week from five, adding Fridays, in a new fall schedule
that includes six new series, one for each night.
</P>
<P>
   WB executives unabashedly declared their desire to appeal
exclusively to the audience they call ``young adults and future
adults, also known as teens,'' an audience they deliver to
advertisers better than any other network.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus is 12-to-34-year-olds and that's it,'' Jamie
Kellner, WB's president, said Tuesday at the annual ritual of
presenting video clips of the next season's lineup to advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   WB's fall schedule keeps its most popular shows in place as
building blocks, for the most part, with the major exception being
``Felicity,'' which will move to Sunday night at 8 p.m. from
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   It will be followed by a New York City-based romantic drama,
``Jack and Jill,'' in which a 20-something man (nicknamed Jill)
moves into an apartment building with his girlfriend, only to be
smitten by another young woman in the building (nicknamed Jack).
</P>
<P>
   The network's most popular show, ``Seventh Heaven,'' which
contrary to marketing strategy has familywide appeal, will remain
on Mondays at 8 p.m., followed by another family drama, ``Safe
Harbor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Safe Harbor'' could be described as ``Seventh Heaven'' moved
to Florida and minus the mother; Gregory Harrison (of ``Trapper
John M.D.'') plays a widower raising four sons.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesdays, ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' will be followed at 9
p.m. by a spinoff show, ``Angel,'' centered on Buffy's former
boyfriend, Angel (David Boreanaz), a vampire tortured by a good
conscience.
</P>
<P>
   WB's other teen-fave show, ``Dawson's Creek,'' stays on
Wednesdays at 8 p.m., but its 9 o'clock companion drama,
``Roswell,'' has more of a ``Buffy'' flavor in that it features a
teen-age boy who, like Buffy, seems normal but has supernatural
powers and uses them to save his pals.
</P>
<P>
   Produced by 20th Century Fox Television, the show landed on WB
instead of Fox, reportedly because WB gave it a full-season
commitment and Fox wanted it only as a potential midseason
replacement show.
</P>
<P>
   The three young witches of ``Charmed'' used to follow
``Dawsons''' but will move to 9 p.m. on Thursday. It will be
preceded by yet another high school drama, ``Popular,'' at 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The network also moved its Thursday night sitcom block to
Fridays, minus ``The Wayans Brothers,'' which will be replaced by
the first animated show about teen-agers and 20-somethings. Called
``The Downtowners,' it was created by two writer-producers formerly
with ``The Simpsons.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is the WB schedule:
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY: 7 p.m., ``Seventh Heaven: Beginnings''; 8, ``Felicity'';
9, ``Jack and Jill.''
</P>
<P>
   MONDAY: 8 p.m., ``Seventh Heaven''; 9, ``Safe Harbor.''
</P>
<P>
   TUESDAY: 8 p.m., ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer''; 9, ``Angel.''
</P>
<P>
   WEDNESDAY: 8 p.m., ``Dawson's Creek''; 9, ``Roswell.''
</P>
<P>
   THURSDAY: 8 p.m., ``Popular''; 9, ``Charmed.''
</P>
<P>
   FRIDAY: 8 p.m., ``The Steve Harvey Show''; 8:30, ``For Your
Love''; 9, ``The Downtowners''; 9:30, ``The Jamie Foxx Show.''

ABC LINEUP REARRANGES HIT SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABC announced a fall schedule Tuesday that moves several of its
established shows to new times, adds three comedies and three
dramas, and preserves the network's Friday lineup of child-oriented
shows, once thought to be near extinction for next season.
</P>
<P>
   Among the changes certain to arouse curiosity was ABC's switch
of its biggest 8 p.m. hit, ``Dharma and Greg,'' to 9 p.m. and one
of its 9 p.m. hits, ``Spin City,'' to 8 p.m. The network is also
taking the unusual step of starting the season with a new drama,
``Once and Again,'' in the spot occupied by ``NYPD Blue,'' although
the latter will return by November, leaving the new series with
nowhere specific to go _ assuming it has built an audience by then.
</P>
<P>
   ABC will add another new drama from the prolific writer David E.
Kelley and one from Kevin Williamson, the creator of ``Dawson's
Creek'' and the ``Scream'' movies.
</P>
<P>
   The Kelley show (Sundays at 9 p.m.) is ``Snoops,'' a
comedy-drama about three young private investigators in Los Angeles
who use all sorts of high-tech means to gather information without
worrying about any laws they might break in the process. The show
stars Gina Gershon.
</P>
<P>
   The Williamson show is ``Wasteland,'' one of next season's
myriad copies of shows broadcast on WB, which for a network with a
tiny audience is wielding a tsunami of influence through shows like
``Dawson's Creek and ``Felicity.'' ``Wasteland'' (Thursdays at 9)
involves six friends, all single and exploring the dating scene in
Manhattan. One is 27 and still a virgin, still in love with her
former boyfriend. Another member of the group is secretly gay.
</P>
<P>
   A gay character is also prominent in ``Oh Grow Up,'' the comedy
getting the best spot on ABC's schedule, appearing after ``Drew
Carey'' on Wednesdays at 9:30. In this show, a divorced man in his
early 40s with a Peter Pan complex decides to share his home with
two male buddies, one of whom is gay. His 18-year-old daughter
suddenly moves in.
</P>
<P>
   The youth-oriented lineup on Fridays will include one show moved
from Tuesday, ``The Hughleys,'' which goes into the 8 p.m. slot,
and one new comedy, ``Odd Man Out,'' at 9:30. ``Odd Man Out'' is
about a 14-year-old boy living with his mother, aunt and three
sisters.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's third new comedy is ``Then Came You'' (Thursdays at 8:30),
about a 34-year-old woman (just inside television's youngest
demographic group for advertiser preferences) who qualifies as an
``older'' woman because she gets involved with a 24-year-old room
service waiter after her marriage breaks up.
</P>
<P>
   The drama getting squeezed into a temporary home on Tuesdays at
10 is one with a formidable pedigree: ``Once and Again,'' the
latest show from Ed Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz of
``Thirtysomething'' and ``My So-Called Life.'' In this series, two
divorced adults (the actors are in their 40s) meet and fall in
love. The show will explore the way their relationship develops and
how it affects their children, still suffering the effects of their
parents' divorces.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in years ABC will challenge NBC's Thursday
lineup by starting out with Drew Carey's ``'Whose Line Is It
Anyway'' at 8, followed by ``Then Came You.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is the ABC schedule:
</P>
<P>
   MONDAY: 8 p.m., ``20/20''; 9, ``Monday Night Football.''
</P>
<P>
   TUESDAY: 8 p.m., ``Spin City;'' 8:30, ``It's Like, You Know'';
9, ``Dharma and Greg'': 9:30, ``Sports Night''; 10, ``NYPD Blue''
(though ``Once and Again'' will start the season here)
</P>
<P>
   WEDNESDAY: 8 p.m., ``Two Guys, A Girl and a Pizza Place''; 8:30,
``The Norm Show''; 9, ``Drew Carey''; 9:30, ``Oh Grow Up''; 10,
``20/20.''
</P>
<P>
   THURSDAY: 8 p.m., `'Whose Line Is It Anyway?''; 8:30, ``Then
Came You''; 9, ``Wasteland''; 10, ``20/20.''
</P>
<P>
   FRIDAY: 8 p.m., ``The Hughleys''; 8:30, ``Boy Meets World''; 9,
``Sabrina''; 9:30, ``Odd Man Out''; 10, ``20/20.''
</P>
<P>
   SATURDAY: 8 p.m., Movie.
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY: 7 p.m., ``Wonderful World of Disney''; 9, ``Snoops'';
10, ``The Practice.''

   KOSOVO-CLINTON _ WASHINGTON _ It was supposed to last three
days. Two months (EDs: Wednesday marks two months since NATO
bombing began March 24) into NATO's air war against Yugoslavia,
however, managing the campaign, the diplomacy aimed at ending it
and the unintended consequences of prolonged bombing has become a
huge and unexpected job for the White House. President Clinton has
emerged as a surprisingly engaged commander in chief, a quick
study, Pentagon officials say, who asks the right questions and
displays the correct instincts on an evolving operation, even as
he's stood fast on the mission's goals. (Deans, Cox News Service)

   KORESCUE _ ATLANTA _ Normally, resettlement agencies have 7 to
10 days notice on when refugees will arrive. However, with the
Kosovar resettlement, those groups are finding themselves in
constant flux and readiness. No one know when they will arrive, and
sometimes, how many. So they find themselves always within reach of
phones and pagers and cellulars, waiting for notice at any time
that victims of war will be arriving in hours. This story looks at
how rescues are different and how it effects the agencies, churches

Mayor Horacio Garza Garza explained as he edged down the steep
stairs to the street. He may need it. With his new get-tough

controversial, ultra-religious Shas Party? The dilemma frames the

   EVERGLADES-LIFE _ THE EVERGLADES, Fla. _ In the central
Everglades, reminders of fire and death linger like the sulfur
smell in the breeze. But so do signs of new life. Saw grass shoots,
an almost fluorescent green, sprout 8 inches above the soil. Leaves
fan out from the base of the dead trunks. And under the ash, the
peat is moist. That means hope for recovery from the wildfires of
the past month, which swept across 170,000 acres of state-owned
Everglades marsh in northwest Broward County. (King, Palm Beach

functioning as a type of poll tax for would-be officeholders. A
lower court judge in Atlanta has ruled to dismiss the lawsuit. The
case centers on a claim filed by John White, a former state
representative from Albany who lost a primary bid for state Senate
in 1996 against incumbent Mark Taylor. Taylor outspent White
$270,000 to $16,000. (Rankin, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   MOTORIST-SHOT _ SMYRNA, Ga. _ A man was shot twice and killed as
he drove down I-75 toward Atlanta early Tuesday morning. Police
said several shots were fired into the driver's side of the vehicle
from outside the car. The victim was described as a Hispanic in his
late teens or early 20s. On Sunday night, police in this same
suburban county reported a Hispanic driver shot while driving on a
surface street. He was wounded in the leg. (Anderson, Atlanta

   AUTO-FAN _ The automobile has an eloquent new defender in the
debate over sprawl and mobility. He is James Dunn, a professor of
political science and public policy at Rutgers University's Camden
campus and author of a new book titled ``Driving Forces: The
Automobile, Its Enemies and the Politics of Mobility'' (Brookings
Institution Press, $19.95). ``It's tough to beat the car with a
ridesharing mandate and a bus that may or may not arrive on time,
or a rail station that's a half-mile away from where you want to go
on a rainy day,'' Dunn said in a telephone interview. (Ledford,

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a recent trip to the Napa Valley, when the vineyards were
ablaze with carpets of yellow mustard flowers, my friend was hoping
to purchase a case of wine she had been unable to find in New York.
</P>
<P>
   She thought it would take no more than a phone call. Instead, it
turned into a 90-minute odyssey that required her to drive to the
vineyard, pay for the wine, have the case put in her car and then
transport it to a shipping service suggested by the winery.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the wacky world of the 50 different sets of state
regulations governing interstate shipment of wine. At this moment
they are on a collision course with an explosion in direct
marketing of wine and other spirits through catalogs, wine clubs
and the Internet as consumers have turned into aficionados.
</P>
<P>
   One of the unintended consequences has been the growth of an
industry in California that barely existed a few years ago:
third-party shipping of wine.
</P>
<P>
   When Prohibition was repealed, in 1933, the federal government
turned the regulation of alcoholic beverages over to the states.
Only 17 allow the interstate shipment of wine to individuals.
Everywhere else, as I was to find out, it is illegal.
</P>
<P>
   It is a misdemeanor in New York, which means that theoretically
the winery could be fined, but in other states judges have ruled
that one state has no jurisdiction in another. For the buyer the
risk could be confiscation.
</P>
<P>
   No one paid much attention to these rules until recently, when
more wineries started turning to direct marketing as their numbers
increased while the number of wine wholesalers decreased. In 1963
there were 377 American wineries; by 1994 there were almost 1,800.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now there are too many brands for wholesalers to carry all of
them,'' said Seana Wagner, a spokeswoman for Free the Grapes!, a
Napa-based national coalition of consumers and winemakers whose
goal is ``to ensure consumer access to fine wines.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who find it hardest to reach customers, she said, are ones
that produce fewer than 50,000 cases a year (some produce fewer
than 10,000).
</P>
<P>
   After my friend's experience, I decided to test how easy _ and
how risky _ it would be to get California wines shipped to New
York. Napa Valley shippers were willing to send wine _ but would it
actually get here?
</P>
<P>
   Calling as an ordinary consumer, I first spoke with more than
two dozen of these small and medium-size wineries to see if they
would ship wine to me at a New York address. Six refused my order.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone found out,'' said the man who answered the phone at
one winery, ``we'd lose our license.'' One winery said it would
ship. ``It's a real gray area to ship wine, but we do it anyway,''
said the person on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   The rest were willing to ship wine, but only through a third
party. And those wineries make it clear that customers must make
their own shipping arrangements and accept full responsibility if
the wine is confiscated by some state governmental entity. Under no
circumstances, they say, are they liable, and they spell out their
position, often in writing. They will, however, provide you with
the phone number of a shipper.
</P>
<P>
   One such warning says: ``The buyer (YOU) is responsible for YOUR
shipment of wines, and as such we will provide the name of a common
carrier for your shipping convenience.''
</P>
<P>
   The company, an online wine shop, adds that it ``in no way
advocates the shipment of wine out of state, and releases any/all
control and liability once the wines leave our facility.''
</P>
<P>
   To learn how these third-party shippers operate, I called eight
and found seven that would ship to New York. Each had different
ground rules, but some were afraid to give details. Four cases from
eight wineries were shipped to me as freight by four companies. All
of them arrived within two weeks. None of the packages bore a
return address of the shipper. In fact, they had no return
addresses, just initials.
</P>
<P>
   None of this mail-order wine came cheaply, because it had to go
through several hands. But to connoisseurs, the extra charges would
probably be unimportant.
</P>
<P>
   Stage Coach Express &AMP; Co. of Napa will pick up the wine at
wineries as far away as Sonoma County, charging $1 a mile for the
round trip, which can add more than $100 to the shipping costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been in business since October,'' said the person who
answered the phone at Stage Coach, which has put its flier in some
wineries. ``All the information we get about shipping wines is
passed on from the people we bought the business from, and everyone
has their own slant. It's difficult to tell who is telling the
right story.''
</P>
<P>
   Stage Coach no longer uses UPS or Federal Express. ``You're
dealing with a situation that depends on the driver who picks it
up,'' the man said. ``We have had UPS and Fedex drivers open up the
boxes and say they aren't taking it. So now from us it goes to a
wine broker, and that wine broker takes it to another wine broker
and the broker ships it to a residence or business at the other
end.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Stage Coach charged $55 to pack and ship my case of wine. The
pickup from three wineries cost about $40.
</P>
<P>
   Like Stage Coach, most of the shipping services have the wine
trucked to a shipper or freight consolidator elsewhere in the
state, far enough from wine country so the appearance of a box full
of bottles is not viewed with suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Aero Packing in Napa picks up the wine at the winery free ``as
long as the winery is willing to work with us,'' said the person
who took my order. The winery fills out the shipping form; Aero
does the packing and transports it to another shipper or
consolidator.
</P>
<P>
   Shipping a single bottle through Aero cost $15. It costs $48 to
send 7 to 12 bottles to a residence and $43 to a business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our carrier is from the Bay area,'' the woman said. ``We
haven't had any problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitch Mountain in Healdsburg will pick up from up to two
wineries per shipment, and if they are fairly close to Healdsburg,
the company charges only $5 a stop. Packaging is $8 a case, and
shipping is $45 to a business and $55 to a residence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've only been here four years,'' said the person who took my
call. ``This shipping wine business is growing a lot. We've got
good relations with a lot of wineries.''
</P>
<P>
   A case is the minimum amount Buffalo Shipping Post of Napa will
pick up, and it does it free from anywhere in the valley twice a
week. The package is sent by ground transportation and costs $57.50
to a business and $62.50 to a home. The company has been in
business for seven years but just added the wine service a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   At Wrap It Transit in Napa, an employee said the shipper would
get wine to me but someone would have to bring it in. ``We do it
for you, but you have to release us of liability,'' she said. ``We
have to disguise it. We package it first in styrofoam and then put
it into another box.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that wine must be sent by three-day air because ``they
don't check that,'' adding that packages sent by ground may be
opened. The company has been shipping about four or five cases a
wine each day for the last eight months, and nothing has come back,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   One online wine shop I called was willing to ship but refused to
share the name of its shipper because, said the man who answered
the phone, ``we get a lot of questions from politicians and others
who want to hunt down the shippers.''
</P>
<P>
   Some wineries have found other ways around the confusing laws.
William Selyem in California is owned by Millbrook Vineyards and
Winery in Millbrook, N.Y., so the Williams Selyem wine can be
legally shipped to New York residents through Millbrook.
</P>
<P>
   Other wineries have set up distributorships in other states and
ship the wines to them. They, in turn, ship to the customer. That
way the state collects the sales tax and no laws are broken.
</P>
<P>
   Some aficionados, eager for California wines they cannot find in
their local shops, have devised their own schemes. One person tells
the winery that the wine is to be used for scientific purposes.
Another explains that he belongs to a private wine club and is
ordering the wine in his official capacity for a tasting. Some use
the mailing address of a wine-wholesaler friend.
</P>
<P>
   After the wine I ordered had arrived, I called the shippers to
ask about their business. Most were not as forthcoming when I
called back and identified myself as a reporter. An exception was
Linda Simpson, who handles orders at Fitch Mountain. Ms. Simpson
said her company had only the normal problems that come with
mail-order delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has come and said, `We're going to take you to jail,'''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are shipping it as private property,'' she continued,
``like if you brought your clothes in here or anything else and
asked us to ship it, we would.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wagner of Free the Grapes! said she had not been aware of
what she describes as ``selling under the radar.'' But she added,
``You are going to be seeing less and less of that as companies are
made more aware of the law,'' especially as states vote to make the
crime a felony instead of a misdemeanor: that can mean jail time
and the loss of a license. ``No one wants to take a chance with
that,'' she said.  &QL;

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first significant rainfall of the month will occur in
sections of the Northeast on Wednesday. A combination of moisture
attendant to a cold front and damp onshore winds from the Atlantic
will produce moderate to heavy showers with embedded thunderstorms
over New England and upstate New York. Many places will receive at
least 1/2 inch of rain, and a few spots could get more than 2
inches. Winds in the lower atmosphere blowing from the southeast
will slightly dry on descent of the western slopes of the
Appalachians. As a result, partial sunshine will raise the risk of
thunderstorms in interior valleys such as the Champlain in northern
Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   A cold front will progress from the Appalachians at daybreak to
the Atlantic Seaboard by sundown. Scattered thundershowers will
dampen the East Coast ahead of the front, but clouds will break
east of the central Appalachians on Wednesday afternoon. The front
will be followed by noticeably less humid air across the Gulf
states and the interior Southeast. Florida will stay hot with
little or no rain.
</P>
<P>
   Pleasant weather will dominate from the Great Lakes through the
Mississippi Valley. The clockwise circulation around high pressure
will direct more humid air back into the Plains. A few
thunderstorms will develop in the Dakotas and over the eastern
Rockies as a Pacific front approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Streamers of cirrus clouds will streak the sky over parts of the
Rockies as moist Pacific air flows over the mountains. Meanwhile,
the Southwest will be sunny, but the Northwest will be dull and
cool at the coast. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Rampaging Rivers
</P>
<P>
   Rampaging rivers submerged small towns in northeastern Iowa
under as much as 10 feet of water early Tuesday as major flooding
occurred on the Volga and Turkey Rivers. At the town of Garber near
the confluence of the two rivers, flood waters crested at 30.6 feet
at noon Tuesday, establishing a new record there. Flood stage is 17
feet and the previous record at Garber was 30.1 feet, set on May
15, 1991. Major flooding came on the heels of clusters of heavy
thunderstorms that repeatedly passed over the same areas Sunday and
Monday, dumping as much as 8 inches of rain in places. &QL;

 By ROBIN POGREBIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One would expect Dael Orlandersmith to be angrier in
person. The material in her searing one-woman play is, after all,
largely based on her own experiences, and those experiences are
hard to hear about, let alone live through: a little girl
physically and emotionally abused by her alcoholic mother; a large,
book-loving girl teased by her peers for being big and being
different; a teen-age girl raped by her best friend's father.
</P>
<P>
   You hear the anger in her play ``The Gimmick,'' about two
childhood friends: Alexis, who wants to be a writer, and Jimmy, who
wants to be an artist. You hear it in the pulsing, insistent rhythm
of Ms. Orlandersmith's writing, more poetry than prose:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing what parents can do, how they can beat you and
say it's all right, I gave birth to you, I can beat you, I feed
you, I can beat you, I clothe you, I can beat you, I can talk to
you any way I want, I brought you in this world, I can talk to you
any way I want, I'm trying to teach you, I'll knock your head
off.''
</P>
<P>
   But sitting across a table over coffee the other morning, her
long brown and gold braids falling around her face, Ms.
Orlandersmith seemed strikingly at peace with the issues that roil
her performance at the New York Theater Workshop on East Fourth
Street. It is as if all the rage and pain that animate her play
have been released in her work. She does not live that bitterness
day to day; she appears to have achieved a necessary distance and
perspective. And she wants most of all to be taken seriously for
writing about the struggles of the inner city, not pitied for
having survived them.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it has nothing to do with me,'' Ms. Orlandersmith
said. ``I'm a playwright. What interests me is how people can use
their bodies as instruments, their words as tools, to get their
point across.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Orlandersmith, who is 39, has been getting her point across
since 1987, when she gave up on trying to get work as an actress _
having been sent to audition for one too many parts as a welfare
mother _ and started writing her own material. Her first play,
``Liar, Liar,'' was presented at Manhattan Class Company in 1994.
Then came ``Beauty's Daughter'' at the American Place Theater, for
which she won an Obie in 1995. Then the acclaimed ``Monster'' at
the New York Theater Workshop in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In a review in The New York Times this month, Peter Marks said
Ms. Orlandersmith's previous one-woman shows ``now seem to have
been mere rehearsals for the more nuanced narrative of `The
Gimmick.''' He described Ms. Orlandersmith as ``a riveting
combatant in a story, like all war stories, that stamps her as one
who has been there.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the trials that her characters endure as they come of
age in her play have the raw specificity that only firsthand
knowledge can convey: a young woman self-conscious about her large
size walking into a clothing store and finding nothing on the racks
but ``size 0, size 3, size 5.'' The Mr. Softie ice cream truck as a
symbol of childhood's elusive sweetness.
</P>
<P>
   One of the moments in ``The Gimmick'' that Ms. Orlandersmith
says moves her the most is when Jimmy is watching television,
fantasizing about leaving Harlem for the blue water in the
background on ``American Bandstand.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, Alexis. See the water, it's so clean,'' he says in his
small voice. Then Jimmy's father steps in front of the television,
squeezes his son's arm, bringing Jimmy to his knees, saying, ``You
stupid l'il nigga talkin' about how you goin' somewhere an' you
can't even read. Can't even spell ocean. How you gonna find it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The sound of a child's voice,'' Ms. Orlandersmith said in the
interview, ``just the killing of a kid's dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Had she been a different kind of child, Ms. Orlandersmith said,
her mother might have killed her dream. ``She is somebody who
should never have had children,'' Ms. Orlandersmith said. ``One
minute, she said, `I love you,' the next minute, `I wish you were
never born.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying I saunter and the rest of the world walks,''
Ms. Orlandersmith continued, ``but it wasn't easy to believe in
myself by myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow Ms. Orlandersmith did develop some self-confidence as
well as the sense that there was a world beyond her neighborhood.
She went downtown to music clubs and museums. She kept diaries. She
kept to herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you can look around you and see what not to do,''
she said. ``I knew what was around me wasn't right. I knew I didn't
want to live that.''
</P>
<P>
   Reading was her rescue. As a young girl, Ms. Orlandersmith
borrowed books from the library _ even stole them from stores
occasionally _ and read voraciously. ``There were times when I
thought I was mad, as in insane,'' she said. ``Then I read `The
Bluest Eye' by Toni Morrison, `Another Country,' by James Baldwin,
`Sideshow' by Rambeau. And I realized I wasn't crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Orlandersmith is currently working on ``Yellowman,'' a play
about patricide commissioned by the McCarter Theater in Princeton,
N.J., where ``The Gimmick'' originated. And this fall she is due to
begin a yearlong residency at the Long Wharf theater in New Haven,
Conn., where she will develop her play, ``Trickbabies,'' about the
offspring of prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's fearless,'' said Peter Askin, who helped Ms.
Orlandersmith conceive ``The Gimmick'' _ which is directed by Chris
Coleman, and closes Sunday _ and has worked with her on her other
projects. ``She's not only willing to go to some dark places, it
seems that she's eager to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Offstage, Ms. Orlandersmith seems more private about those dark
places. As she speaks, one senses the inside-outside voices that
she herself writes about _ that outside, she is saying, `Don't feel
sorry for me, don't analyze me, my work speaks for itself.' And
inside, there will always be the child saying, ``Like me, take me
seriously, respect my work,'' like Alexis showing her notebook to
Jimmy for the first time:
</P>
<P>
   ``outside I say ``you can read it''
</P>
<P>
   inside I say ``don't laugh at me''
</P>
<P>
   outside I say ``I'm going to be a famous writer one day''
</P>
<P>
   inside I say ``don't laugh at me don't tell the other kids on
the block''
</P>
<P>
   outside I say ``I write a lot even though I'm 8 years old. I
like to write I'm not like these stupid kids around here''
</P>
<P>
   inside I say ``the other kids don't like me. They laugh at me.
Be my friend you read my story and be my friend.''

STRICT LAWS GOVERNING WINE DISTRIBUTION MAY GET STRICTER

 By R.W. APPLE JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Propelled in part by increased alcohol sales on the Internet,
intensive campaigns to restrict wine distribution further are afoot
in state legislatures and in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed regulations would make it much harder for producers
of scarce or unevenly distributed wines to ship directly to
consumers, and for retailers to ship across state lines. Order
those alluring bottles of Rochioli pinot noir or Screaming Eagle
cabernet sauvignon you see on the Web, and you could wind up with a
felony charge _ if you live in the wrong state and if anyone can
figure out how to enforce the new legislation.
</P>
<P>
   It could be that the campaigns, financed mostly by wholesalers
who fear the loss of business, will fizzle out. But they could
succeed, and some fear that if they do, the choice of wines will be
severely constricted for almost all wine drinkers.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Aaron, chairman of Sherry-Lehmann in Manhattan, one of
the country's largest wine retailers, argues that attempts to
tighten the rules for shipments across state lines will lead to the
disruption of shipments within states, even package store
deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless this ludicrous anticonsumer campaign is stopped, there
will be nothing left but a shadow of our industry,'' he said
recently.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, said a California producer, who asked not to be
identified, ``guns are going to be easier to buy than my
chardonnay.''
</P>
<P>
   As things stand, wine shipments are governed by a tangle of
state laws, observed by some in the trade, largely ignored by
others. Enforcement has been slack, prosecution rare, though all 50
states regulate direct interstate shipment of alcohol in some way,
21 ban it altogether and seven have made shipments by wineries or
retailers or both a felony.
</P>
<P>
   Felony laws are under consideration in at least 10 other states,
including New Jersey, Simon Siegl of the American Vintners
Association in Washington said. A felony bill failed last year in
New York state and has not yet been reintroduced this year, but
hearings are scheduled in Albany, the state capital, on the sale of
wine to minors on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, a hotly debated bill has been introduced to bring
the federal judicial system into the enforcement picture.
</P>
<P>
   A vexed history, with its roots in Puritanism, lies behind the
controversy. When Prohibition, imposed in 1920, was repealed in
1933, free commerce in alcoholic products such as most other
countries have was not established here. Each state was authorized
to regulate the sale of alcohol within its boundaries. That led to
the evolution of what the industry calls ``the three-tier system,''
under which vintners, distillers and importers sell to wholesalers,
who sell to retailers, who sell to consumers. Those who support the
system say it is the only effective way to control shipments and
collect state taxes, which exceed $8 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the liquor and beer market is controlled by a few
nationally advertised brands, so there is little reason for
consumers to order directly, although micro-beers and small-batch
brandies are exceptions. There are 1,800 American wine producers,
however. Many, including many of the best, are too small to catch
the eye of big distributors. It is from them that connoisseurs
order. Some sell only to mailing lists.
</P>
<P>
   The wholesalers are the political powerhouse, and a few huge,
privately owned companies have come to dominate the business
recently, with the top five commanding a third of the industry's
total revenues, according to the Impact Newsletter, a New
York-based industry publication.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Wine and Spirits of America, headquartered in Miami, is
the biggest, with wine and liquor sales this year projected to be
$2.8 billion. Mel Dick, a senior vice president, is described by
industry insiders as a driving force behind the anti-shipping
campaign. His office said he was traveling in Europe, and he did
not return messages seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   But Dick's home state, Florida, is the biggest state so far to
make direct shipment a felony. (The others are Georgia, Indiana,
Kentucky, North Carolina, Oklahoma and Tennessee.) A former speaker
of the Florida House, Don Tucker, now a lobbyist for Southern, was
a key player in that move.
</P>
<P>
   Lawton Chiles, then the Florida governor, allowed the felony act
to become law without his signature, despite the argument of the
Florida attorney general, Robert Butterworth, that its principal
effect would be to tighten the wholesalers' ``vise-grip on the
distribution of alcoholic beverages.''
</P>
<P>
   Backers of new restrictions present their effort as a crusade
against under-age drinking, which they say has been facilitated by
direct shipping. One leading supporter of restriction, a pressure
group called Americans for Responsible Alcohol Access, describes
such shipments as ``a coast-to-coast, $1-billion-a-year black
market in alcohol.'' The problem has been exacerbated, it says, by
orders placed over the Internet and toll-free telephone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents call that a smoke screen for naked self-interest by
liquor wholesalers. They ask why teen-agers would bother with phone
or Internet orders, which involve waiting for deliveries, when most
have fake IDs or friends who will buy for them. The volume of
direct shipment may be as high as $1 billion, but government
agencies estimate it at only $300 million to $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   Americans for Responsible Alcohol Access has the backing of the
National Transportation Safety Board and others, but it was created
by the Wine and Spirits Wholesalers of America, which pays its
bills. The wholesalers, of course, lose a lot of money when wine is
sold directly by vineyards to consumers, rather than through them.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers Against Drunk Driving withdrew its support this week.
The group's president, Karolyn Nunnallee, said that the fight was
not about sales to minors but ``a battle between various elements
within the alcoholic beverages industry.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The group's executive director, Barry McCahill, has been a vocal
advocate of a bill sponsored by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who heads
the Senate Judiciary Committee, which would enable state attorneys
general to seek injunctions in federal court against violators of
state liquor laws. In a statement issued for a committee hearing on
March 9, McCahill said action was needed to ``effectively combat
this modern form of bootlegging.''
</P>
<P>
   Also involved in the push for passage is McGuiness &AMP; Holch, a
lobbying firm that has been retained by the wholesalers. It is
headed by Kevin McGuiness, a former chief of staff for Hatch.
</P>
<P>
   McCahill acknowledged that under-age drinkers ``get wine and
beer and liquor a lot of ways, including fake IDs.'' But that was
no reason, he asserted, ``to let more loopholes open in enforcing
the laws, and nobody who's obeying the present law has anything to
fear from this bill.''
</P>
<P>
   The hearing included a Utah television station's investigative
report depicting a minor buying beer on the Internet with a
computer and somebody else's credit card.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that story doesn't bother you, it should,'' Hatch said.
``If a 13-year-old is capable of ordering beer and having it
delivered merely by `borrowing' a credit card and clicking a mouse,
there is something wrong with the level of control being exercised
over these sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that their member wineries had been struggling for two
decades to win legal approval for limited direct shipments,
officials of the American Vintners Association and the Wine
Institute strongly opposed criminalization of such shipments. They
said that 15 states had authorized direct interstate commerce, with
safeguards to prevent illegal sales to minors, and that 30 states
permitted intrastate sales under similar restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesmen for the vineyards insisted that the only recorded
instances of Internet wine sales to minors involved stings _
entrapments set up either by journalists or by law-enforcement
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. George Radanovich, R-Calif., who owns a small vineyard, was
another opposition speaker at the March 9 hearing. He argued that
``the real issue is the fact that the national wholesalers are
concerned about the increased competition from the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Big retailers could be affected, too. Many now send small
amounts of wine to other states as gifts, either for individuals or
for corporations who might give a case of Champagne to each of 50
or more suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, a Mormon and a teetotaler, pledged to restudy the bill to
seek a compromise. Later, he threatened to attach it, unmodified,
to the juvenile justice bill, and after he withdrew that threat, a
similar move was made by Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many other things, direct shipping has been brought into
sharper public focus by the Internet. In Texas, booming Internet
sales were cited by David Sibley, a state senator who advocates
penalties of up to two years in jail for those shipping illegally.
``There's no accountability at all,'' he said. ``It's like a
parking ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet sales are the topic of the hearing Wednesday in Albany
before the Assembly Standing Committee on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse
and the Legislative Commission on Science and Technology. Among
those testifying will be Aaron, a member of a trade delegation that
also includes Jeff Zacharia of Zachy's in Scarsdale, N.Y., another
of the country's leading retailers; John Dyson, who owns important
vineyards in New York and California, and Manfred Ohrenstein,
former leader of the Democrats in the state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that kids don't drink wine,'' Aaron declares in
a statement prepared for the hearing. ``They don't like the way it
tastes.''
</P>
<P>
   A bill backed by the group would change New York's law, which
forbids residents to receive direct shipments. It would allow
wineries or retailers to ship up to an average of two cases of wine
to anyone at least 21 years old in the state, as long as the state
of origin permits its residents to receive direct shipments (as
California and Oregon do). Containers would have to be marked
``contains alcohol _ signature of a person age 21 or older required
for delivery.''
</P>
<P>
   The legal issues are far from settled. Despite Florida's new
felony law, a state court there dismissed a case against two
out-of-state retailers who shipped into the state in September
1997, on the ground that it lacked jurisdiction. An appeals court
later upheld that verdict.
</P>
<P>
   An article in March in the Virginia Law Review questioned the
constitutionality of Florida's statute and similar laws. The
article, by Vijay Shanker, asserts that they are ``a clear example
of protectionist legislation that detrimentally impacts interstate
commerce'' and, as such, unconstitutional. They ``cannot be saved''
by the 21st Amendment, which granted the states the right to
regulate alcohol, Shanker adds, because they do not involve ``core
powers'' that were promulgated under the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   That issue will probably eventually reach the Supreme Court.

   Snow Will Cover Walls In Brooklyn in Summer &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn Museum of Art is offering a last chance to see
``Impressionists in Winter: Effets de Neige,'' an exhibition of
snowy scenes that has already drawn big crowds at the Phillips
Collection in Washington and at the Fine Arts Museums of San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition demonstrates how the Impressionists used deep
shadows and various shades of white and gray to explore the visual
characteristics of snow. Over a 30-year period that began in the
mid-1860s, the artists turned out works depicting various aspects
of France in cold weather, from snow-covered rooftops at twilight
to fields of virgin snow in the morning light.
</P>
<P>
   Monet painted his first winter scene in 1865, and eventually
produced more than 140 snow scenes. Pissaro and Sisley soon took up
the theme, followed by Renoir, Caillebotte and Gauguin.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 55 works drawn from more than 20 museums and 20
private collections will be Monet's ``Red Cape,'' which shows his
wife, Camille, through a window; Renoir's ``Skaters in the Bois de
Bologne,'' Sisley's ``Snow Effect at Louveciennes'' and
Caillebotte's ``Rooftops in Snow.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooklyn was not part of the show's original itinerary, and a
few works shown previously will not be on view. But the Brooklyn
Museum has added a few paintings, including Cezanne's ``Melting
Snow, Fontainebleau'' from the Museum of Modern Art, and six
Japanese woodcuts that influenced the Impressionists' snowscapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Impressionists in Winter'' will remain at the Brooklyn Museum,
until Aug. 29. The museum is open Wednesday through Sunday. Dated
and timed tickets, which cost $9.50 and $7.50 for seniors and
students (with ID in person only), can be purchased by phone, (877)
946-8379, on the Internet (www.2btech.com/winter) or at the museum.

   U.S. Issues, Then Lifts, A Warning on China &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For several days, the State Department urged Americans to
postpone travel to China because of the angry response to the NATO
forces' bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. It issued a
travel warning on May 9 because street demonstrations began outside
the American Embassy in Beijing soon after the accidental bombing
in Belgrade on May 7. American businesses were also attacked and
citizens harassed.
</P>
<P>
   On May 13, it rescinded the warning, saying that the security
situation had improved, although the potential still existed for
further violent acts. It urged United States citizens in China to
remain alert and to avoid areas of demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   The United States Embassy in Beijing and its consulates in other
cities were shut temporarily in the week after the Belgrade
bombing, but were resuming operations last Monday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The State Department offers travel information at (202)
647-5225, and on the Web at travel.state.gov. &QL;

<P>
   New Aquarium Flows From Denver to Asia &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On June 21, Denver joins the growing list of landlocked cities
that have aquariums. The aquarium, Colorado's Ocean Journey, will
feature 15,000 specimens representing more than 300 species of
fish, birds, mammals and invertebrates. Two exhibits will simulate
two major waterways: the Colorado River and the Kampar River in
Sumatra. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the Sumatran habitats recreated in the Indonesian River
Journey exhibit are a rain forest and a coral lagoon. At an
interactive area within a mangrove swamp, visitors can view unusual
species like the upside-down jelly and the archerfish. Two Sumatran
tigers swim in a pool. Where the river ``reaches'' the ocean,
visitors can view sharks and tropical fish above and below. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado River exhibit depicts the journey of the river from
its origins as a mountain stream to the Sea of Cortez. Visitors can
follow the river on its 1,500-mile journey to a wetlands area,
through a canyon and into desert.
</P>
<P>
   At the entrance of the Sea of Cortez exhibit, the surf splashes
above visitors who view the surging tide and a variety of
invertebrate life, and seahorses, squirrelfish and moray eels.
Shorebirds forage for food along the shore near the fabricated
skeletal remains of a gray whale.
</P>
<P>
   The aquarium also features a Sea Otter Cove, with southern sea
otters. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's Ocean Journey is at 700 Water Street, just off Exit
211 of Interstate 25, and will be open 9 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. Monday
to Friday and 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. on weekends through Labor Day; 10
a.m. to 6 p.m. daily the rest of the year. Closed Christmas.
Admission is $14.95, $12.95 ages 13 to 17 and 65 and older, and
$6.95 ages 4 to 12. Information: (303) 561-4450 or

   A Pushkin Celebration on His Family's Estate &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Aficionados of Russian literature who are visiting Russia next
month can join the anniversary celebration of the national poet,
Aleksandr Pushkin. This year marks the 200th anniversary of the
birth of the poet, who died in a duel in 1837. Pushkinskiye Gory, a
town in the rolling green countryside of the Pskov region, about
225 miles south of St. Petersburg, that is the site of Pushkin's
estate, Mikhailovskoye, is bracing for an onslaught of tourists for
the festivities on June 6. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The directors of the Pushkin Museum Nature Preserve, which
includes Mikhailovskoye and two other estates belonging to
Pushkin's family and close friends, expect up to 500,000 literary
pilgrims. A six-room house set among pine trees and fruit orchards
is a re-creation of the late-18th-century house where Pushkin wrote
``Boris Godunov'' and much of ``Yevgeny Onegin.''
</P>
<P>
   The original structure, which was rebuilt after fires in the
early 20th century, was destroyed by German troops during World War
II. The present building, on the original foundation, dates from
the late '40s, and reproduces the house as it was in Pushkin's day,
with some items he used, like a silver candleholder, dishes and a
samovar.
</P>
<P>
   A peaceful refuge amid the bustle is the white stucco
Svyatogorsky Monastery of the Dormition, where the poet is buried
and where black-robed monks live and pray beneath the monastery's
silver cupolas. On June 6, there will be a procession to Pushkin's
grave to lay a wreath.
</P>
<P>
   Ceremonies surrounding the reopening of Mikhailov-skoye, which
has been closed for over a year, a folk music concert and readings
from Pushkin's works are also scheduled that day. Other events,
including an annual Pushkin literary conference on Aug. 21 and 22
(this year focusing on folklore), are scheduled throughout the
summer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pushkinskiye Gory's 900 hotel beds are booked for June 6 and
well into the summer. There may be rooms available in Pskov, an
hour's drive away, the museum says.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the summer, rooms may be available for about $10 a
night at two guest houses at Mikhailovskoye and at Trigorskoye,
another estate in the museum complex. Visitors can also stay in
Novgorod (where rates run about $150 a night) and St. Petersburg
($150 to $300), both about four and a half hours away.
</P>
<P>
   Admission to the museum is $1, $2 for a guided tour. For more
information on lodging and festivities, call the museum's travel
office, (7-81146) 23352, or the museum itself, (7-81146) 21762. The
Pskovintour travel agency in Pskov, (7-8112) 72-00-06, has an
English-speaking staff and can arrange tours and lodging.

 &HT;    SURGING ULTRA-RELIGIOUS PARTY POSES FIRST DILEMMA FOR BARAK
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The election success of an ultra-religious party
intensified Israel's so-called culture war and posed a dilemma
Tuesday for Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak as he tried to form his
government.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis woke up to find, with final tallies in from Monday's
election, that the ultra-Orthodox Shas Party was nearly as large as
the Likud Party, long the No. 2 party in the country. Shas jumped
from 10 seats to 17 seats in the fractious 120-seat parliament,
called the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
   Shas's ascendancy highlighted the growing tension over Israel's
racial and religious politics. Most Israeli's already worry that
the country could be endangered by the rift between Israel's
secular Jews and its religious Jews, who in recent years have
become more powerful and sought more influence over daily life.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the conflict pits the fundamentalist, conservative and
cloistered world of Shas against the liberal, loose and often
hedonistic world of most Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   In Har Nof, a Shas neighborhood of dozens of apartment blocks
and religious schools, little boys with side curls and yamulka's
play on their BMX bicycles while mothers watch in their head
scarves and long skirts -- required for modesty. The scene is
suburban, but there is suspicion of those outside, who, in Shas
eyes, violate Jewish law.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of hatred,'' said Shoshana Reisner, a Shas
voter and a mother of three. ``They hate us and they do things to
offend us.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak's Labor Party has just 27 seats in parliament and he needs
to form a majority coalition of 61 seats in 45 days. Include Shas,
and he could anger the secular supporters who were key to his
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Exclude Shas, and Barak could create a powerful enemy and
inflame Israel's bitter secular-religious rift.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli news reported Tuesday night that Barak was searching for
a way to include Shas in his government. It could be just a
flirtation, an attempt by Barak to play off against each other all
the smaller parties negotiating to join him. Customarily, parties
demand cabinet posts and other deals to join.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has said he would not negotiate with controversial Shas
Party leader Rabbi Aryeh Deri, awaiting appeal on a bribery
conviction. On Tuesday, Deri announced that he was resigning from
parliament, appearing to open the door to negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see myself excluding any big party,'' said Natan
Sharansky, head of the party that represents Russian-speaking
Israelis and a member of Barak's coalition team. ``We're talking
about a very big part of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Shas represents Sephardic Jews -- both ultra-religious and
secular. They are the approximately 45 percent of Israel's Jewish
population that is descended from other Middle Eastern and Asian
countries. They feel alienated and mistreated by Jews of European
descent.
</P>
<P>
   Barak campaigned on ending Israel's divisive atmosphere and
representing all Israelis. If he wants to carry out his difficult
agenda, including a revival of the controversial peace negotiations
with the Palestinians, he cannot antagonize any large group.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they were a small party, you could,'' said political
scientist Eliezer Don-Yehiya of Bar-Ilan University. ``You can't
ignore them now.''
</P>
<P>
   Shas wants in because it depends on government money for its
network of schools and welfare services. It was a member of the
coalitions of prime ministers Yitzhak Rabin and Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   But, secular Israelis are angry that religious students, who
often stay in studies for their lifetimes, get government subsidies
and are exempted from military service.
</P>
<P>
   Ultra-religious Jews, a minority of 5 to 10 percent of the
population, have succeeded in certain closing stores and roads on
the weekly sabbath. They also control government laws concerning
what kinds of marriages and burials are allowed, and that
de-legitimize the less-traditional forms of Judiasm favored among
American Jews.

CANADA'S BIGGEST COPPER MINE CLOSED IN LABOR DISPUTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TIMOTHY PRITCHARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Canada's largest copper mine has been shut down
indefinitely following the unionized work force's rejection of a
cost-cutting contract that management called critical to the
operation's profitability.
</P>
<P>
   The Highland Valley mine in south-central British Columbia
accounts for about 1.5 percent of global output of copper and is
considered one of the world's highest-cost producers. It has come
under intense pressure in the last year because of falling copper
prices and excess supply, a reflection of weakened demand from the
faltering economies in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations on the contract were suspended for at least two
weeks by a government mediator last weekend, and the consortium of
companies that own the mine closed it Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear when the mine will reopen. But widespread
anticipation that the mine might shut down has been partly
responsible for a recent rise in copper prices. Copper is now
trading at about 70 cents a pound, slightly more than what Highland
Valley's owners call the mine's break-even cost of 68 cents a
pound.
</P>
<P>
   Cominco Ltd. of Vancouver holds 50 percent of the mine complex,
which is near Kamloops, British Columbia. Smaller stakes are held
by Rio Algom Ltd., Tech Corp. and Highmont Mining Co.
</P>
<P>
   In January, when copper traded at 65 cents a pound, the owners
said they would shut it in May unless concessions were made by the
mine workers, members of the United Steelworkers of America, and by
the British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority, which provides
electric power to the mine.
</P>
<P>
   The power company agreed earlier this year to cut electricity
costs when the price of copper slipped to less than 62 cents a
pound.
</P>
<P>
   Don Cott, British Columbia's assistant deputy minister of labor
and a mediator in the dispute, said talks broke off Sunday because
a settlement seemed unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   The owners seek nearly $7 million in annual cost savings and
have sought to cut wages because of a 32 percent drop in copper
prices since 1997. The mine, which produced 170,000 metric tons of
copper last year, has an estimated 10 years of reserves.
</P>
<P>
   The 980 miners at the mine make about $17.70 an hour and have
been working without a contract since September.

GOVERNMENT UNION SAYS SOCIAL SECURITY PLAN WOULD COST $25 BILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's largest union of public employees
warned Tuesday that any effort to move government workers into the
Social Security system would cost them and their employers $25
billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
   The result, leaders of the 1.3 million-member American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Union said,
would be reduced public services and possibly higher taxes as
governments scrambled to make up the shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Requiring all public employees to participate in Social
Security would be a huge and costly mistake,'' said Edwin Jayne,
AFSCME associate director of legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The original Social Security Act of 1935 excluded government
workers from the pay-as-you-go Social Security retirement benefit
system. Over time, however, Congress extended such benefits to
public employees not already covered by their state and local
employers' pension plans.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security Administration estimates that 5 million
workers now are in such pension plans funded by their government
employers and neither pay into nor receive Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Several congressional plans to overhaul Social Security have
advocated incorporating newly hired public employees workers into
Social Security as a way of boosting the system's flagging trust
fund. Under current estimates, the fund will be unable to pay full
benefits starting in 2034.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference here, AFSCME officials unveiled a study
showing how adding the newly hired workers to Social Security would
cost the $25 billion over five years. That figure, said Cathie
Eitelberg, the consultant who authored the study, was derived by
assuming a 9 percent yearly turnover and a 3 percent rise in
payroll each year.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers yielded were recalculated along with the cost to
governments and their workers of paying the 12.4 percent Social
Security payroll tax, which Eitelberg said produced the $25 billion
figure. Adding public employees would extend the life of the Social
Security trust fund by only two years, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jayne and Thomas Lussier, chairman of the Coalition to Preserve
Social Security, an employer-union group formed to fight Social
Security enrollment for government workers, said state and local
governments would have little choice but to reduce services or
raise taxes.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, inclusion of government workers was part of several
congressional plans to fix Social Security. But support for the
idea has dwindled after a concerted lobbying effort by AFSCME and
the coalition. ``We've been successful in demonstrating the pain is
not worth the gain,'' Lussier said.
</P>
<P>
   But Lussier insisted that in future congressional deliberations
over how best to prop up Social Security. lawmakers might revive
the idea.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Social Security and the existing government-run counterparts
have different structures, Eitelberg explained. Under the
pay-as-you-go Social Security system, payroll taxes of those
working today go to pay the benefits of current retirees. Social
Security is envisioned as part of an individual's retirement
income, to be combined with an employment-based pension plan and
personal savings.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Eitelberg said, state and local government
retirement plans are pre-funded, meaning that workers pay into them
and draw on them as an all-inclusive pension. They are structured
to take care of public employees such as firemen and policemen who
often retire at 55 as the physical demands of their jobs become too
great for them.
</P>
<P>
   Reliance on Social Security, which permits early retirement at
62, would not take care of public employees' retirement income
needs, Eitelberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The study included a chart showing potential impact to
government workers in each state.
</P>
<P>
   For California, with 903,000 public employees not covered by
Social Security, the cost over five years would be $4.1 billion.
For New York, with 90,680 such workers, the cost would be $704
million. For Michigan, with 85,808 workers, the cost would be
$632.4 million. For Texas, with 515,751 such workers, the cost
would be $2.6 billion. For Washington state, with 46,868 workers,
the cost would be $363.8 million.

SEN. ABRAHAM RENEWS EFFORT TO SCRAP BORDER-CROSSING PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., announced Tuesday
that he would lead a new effort to kill a program requiring
Canadians and Mexicans traveling to and from the United States to
be logged in and out of the country by U.S. customs and immigration
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham said such a system would delay traffic moving across the
U.S. border by a day or more, effectively shutting down the
U.S.-Canada border and damaging business and tourism in both
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham met Tuesday with Raymond Chretien, Canada's ambassador
to the United States, to discuss legislation he is sponsoring to
cancel the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our own feeling is that it is going backwards,'' Chretien said
of the proposed border-crossing system.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham and Chretien were joined at a news conference by Herb
Dhaliwal, Canada's minister of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of Canadians are waived into the United States
after U.S. immigration officers ask them a few questions, such as
how long they plan to stay in the country. Along the U.S.-Mexico
border, visitors entering the United States are asked to show
identification.
</P>
<P>
   If the new border-crossing system is implemented, however, it
would require border agents to check identification of everyone
entering and leaving the United States from Mexico and Canada and
log that information into a computer.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. agents would also be required to check the identification
of foreigners leaving the United States and log their exit into a
computer. The majority of Canadians and Mexicans are currently not
stopped when they leave the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The new border-crossing program was set up by the 1996
immigration reform law and was intended to cut down on the flow of
illegal drugs and illegal immigrants crossing U.S. borders.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers from northern states have been trying to repeal it
ever since, arguing that the system would simply impede traffic at
the borders rather than stop illegal immigration and drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   The program was intended to begin last October. The Senate last
year voted to scrap the system, but the House disagreed. Lawmakers
ultimately agreed on a 30-month moratorium on putting the program
into effect until mid-2001.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham said hiring more border-patrol agents to look for drug
smuggling would be more effective than logging people in and out of
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., recently introduced identical
legislation in the House that would stop the implementation of the
computerized-border patrol system.
</P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Abraham called for additional U.S. Customs and
Immigration and Naturalization Service personnel to staff
U.S.-Canada border check points in Michigan to help alleviate
increased traffic congestion.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to top U.S. Customs and INS officials, Abraham also
asked for additional inspection lanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some cases a trip that five years ago took 10 to 15 minutes
can now take up to an hour on a typical morning,'' Abraham wrote.
He noted that traffic between Detroit and Windsor, Ontario, has
been growing at 8 percent annually.

STUDENTS COACH CONGRESS ON VIOLENCE IN SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Stephen Keene watched helplessly as a fellow
student shot and killed three other teen-agers and wounded his
younger brother Craig at a Kentucky high school in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Keene, 17, recounted his experiences Tuesday before a House
Education subcommittee that was holding a forum on school shootings
like the ones that occurred at Keene's school in Paducah and more
recently at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't get over it,'' Keene told about 25 lawmakers who sat
with rapt attention. ``You can hardly control yourself sometimes
because you are crying so hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Atteberry said May 21, 1998, was a normal day at his school
in Springfield, Ore. ``The next thing I know I'm laying on the
ground paralyzed, my head filled with a deaf ringing sound.''
</P>
<P>
   On that day, a fellow student opened fire in the cafeteria of
Thurston High, killing two other students.
</P>
<P>
   Atteberry, 17, spent five days in the hospital recovering from a
gunshot wound to his throat, with a bullet was lodged near his
spine. The bullet remains in his body because of the risks of
removing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here today to encourage everyone to help stop school
violence,'' he told the lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers, like the students, grappled with ways to stop
violence while admitting there is no perfect solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is we can't solve everything, but we have an
obligation to do everything we can,'' said Rep. Carolyn McCarthy,
D-N.Y., who ran for Congress in 1996 to advocate stronger
gun-control laws. McCarthy's husband was killed and her son was
partially disabled by a gunman on a Long Island commuter train in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the problems are complex,'' McCarthy said. ``But I believe
the easy access to guns is a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Anita Wheeler, a student at Western High School in Baltimore,
suggested reducing class sizes.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dale Kildee, D-Mich., went further, wondering if the
overall size of schools should be reduced. Columbine High, for
example, has more than 1,800 students.
</P>
<P>
   Keene said that probably wasn't the answer and noted that his
school, Heath High, has about 600 students.
</P>
<P>
   Atteberry said Congress might consider giving schools money to
hire people to monitor hallways and to stop people who are trolling
the hallways when classes are in session.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers and students also discussed gun control, and providing
federal support for after-school programs and for hiring more
school counselors.
</P>
<P>
   But Keene said parents have the main responsibility to teach
their children values and morals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't expect the schools to raise our children,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Campbell, who is a senior at Columbine High, told the
congressional committee that the schools weren't to blame. He was
not wounded in the April 20 attack, when two Columbine schoolmates
killed a dozen other students and a teacher before taking their own
lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that our schools have done as well as they can because
you cannot change or control teen behavior,'' Campbell, 18, said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless Congress is likely to find some way to act against
school violence.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Michael Castle, R-Del., chairman of the House Education
Early Childhood, Youth and Families subcommittee, said the
Columbine case ``galvanized the country'' to do something to
address the recent outbreaks of violence in public schools.

DEFENSEMAN SWEENEY HAS HIS JOB ALL SIZED UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ There was a time when Don Sweeney could
rationalize that he was, if not an average-sized defenseman, pretty
darn close to it.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is on a team with both a 6-foot-4-inch, 220-pound
defenseman (Kyle McLaren) and a defenseman out of science fiction
(the 6-7, 240-pound Hal Gill). Compared with those Brobdingnagian
blue liners, 5-10 and 180 seems downright puny.
</P>
<P>
   Is he, you know, envious of these sturdy mates?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that way,'' he shrugs. ``I've always been this
size. I don't know anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   If during his 11 years with the Bruins (two partial and nine
full) the 32-year old Harvard grad has fallen from the middle of
the size pack to the bottom third, or even bottom fourth, so be it.
He's still here, isn't he?
</P>
<P>
   He's here, all right, and he's been playing as well as ever.
When someone thinks of Boston Bruins defensemen, it is only right
and proper to start the discussion with No. 77. Ray Bourque is a
legend, as everyone knows. But Don Sweeney also has a lot to offer.
If any young player would like to bone up on the rudiments of being
a pure defensive defenseman, he would do well to study the quiet
professional who has been one of the team's top performers during
both the Carolina and Buffalo series.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is so quick on the puck and so steady,'' salutes Gill.
``And he has come up huge for us in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as Sweeney can't imagine being anything other than 5-10,
so, too, is it impossible for the elongated Gill to imagine not
being the biggest man on the ice. And as for being 5-10, 180 and
whacking people . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``There are guys his size, and smaller, who play in the
league,'' Gill points out, ``but not many of them are impact
players. For Donnie to do what he does amazes me. How he gets his
shoulder into guys on checks and drives people. I can't relate to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got to be challenging for him to play that way,'' adds
McLaren. ``A lot of guys in this league are now 6-2, 6-3, 6-4 and
220, 230 pounds, and Donnie's not that. But no one is more
competitive. He wants to compete and he wants to be in there.''
</P>
<P>
   It was agonizing for Sweeney to miss Game 4 of this series with
a recurrent back injury. Someone might want to play as much as
Sweeney does, but no one wants to play more.
</P>
<P>
   It surprised no one when he willed himself back into action for
Game 5 Sunday. It also surprised no one when he contributed the
goal that tied the game at 1-1 after a bounce off the back of a
linesman contributed to a Buffalo goal in the game's opening 27
seconds. It was Sweeney's third goal of the playoffs, and it made
him a 50-goal man.
</P>
<P>
   That's 50 goals in a combined 841 regular-season and playoff
games.
</P>
<P>
   He has matched a playoff career high with three goals, and it
happens to be one more goal than he scored in 80 regular-season
games. His teammates are starting to wonder why he's been
surpressing this Orr thing buried in his personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to teach me how to put the puck in the corner like
that,'' smiles McLaren. ``But it's been great to see. He has really
stepped it up during the playoffs. His goals have all been big
ones, not empty-netters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys have been kidding about the scoring,'' Sweeney
acknowledges. ``I've said all along that in the playoffs everyone
has to contribute in different areas. A defenseman might score a
goal, and a goal scorer has to check, too. It's all about
winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney never was programmed for pro stardom. A 1984
eighth-round pick (166th overall), and even then somewhat
undersized, he had been a fine player at Harvard, but that plus 50
cents gets you the morning paper in the eyes of the NHL. But after
six playoff games in Portland in the spring of '88, he made it to
the big time the following season, bouncing back and forth between
the AHL and the NHL before coming back to Boston in January of '89.
He would spend only 11 more games in the minors before making it
back up for good.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, if anyone told him he was too small, he simply
ignored them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stopped believing that a long time ago,'' he says. ``For a
while at Harvard I tried to bulk up. But I'm actually lighter now
than I was then, and I'm quicker.''
</P>
<P>
   He may not say a whole lot in the locker room, but when the puck
is dropped he plays with a passion and fury that were born out of
fear and now simply are a reflection of gratitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might have taken me four or five years to establish myself
fully,'' he maintains. ``I was always afraid for my job in those
days. I'm talking about the difference between taking up space on
the roster and being able to make a real contribution. But I think
all that helped me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never stopped being grateful for being able to play in
the league, and for being able to play with Ray Bourque. I feel as
if I grew up watching him play, and the opportunity to play with
him here in Boston is something I never take for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   He will admit to being amused and fascinated as NHL defensemen
have continued to grow, even as he remains 5-10 and 180.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really see it every preseason,'' he says. ``That's when
every team brings out all its prospects for the exhibition games,
and each year they are getting bigger and bigger. It just amazes me
how big everyone is.''
</P>
<P>
   Big is nice, but the central question remains, ``Can you play?''
Very few of these young monsters will become the 11-year veteran
Don Sweeney is, let alone the 15-year veteran he almost certainly
will be. There must be more to it than size, skating, and shooting
ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``The heart factor always comes into play,'' reminds Don
Sweeney.

 &HT;    FORBES OFFERS PLAN TO CREATE PRIVATIZE RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS
 &HT;    430&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes
offered a plan Tuesday to let workers to privately invest their
Social Security taxes, and challenged Vice President Al Gore to
debate him on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The union bosses might not like my message very much,'' Forbes
said in a speech to small business owners. ``The special interest
lobbyists in Washington may be a little worried about their job
security. But I can guarantee you that no hard-working union
employee would turn down the chance to double or triple his or her
retirement income.
</P>
<P>
   ``No senior citizen _ no matter what his or her politics _ would
deny their children and grandchildren the opportunity to build real
assets if they knew their own Social Security would be safe and
secure,'' Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes offered to debate Social Security reform with Gore before
audiences of union workers in Michigan, senior citizens in Florida
and Arizona, and blacks and Latinos in California.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lahane, the vice president's spokesman, dismissed Forbes'
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an obvious ploy by a second-tier candidate to get some
attention,'' Lahane said. ``If Steve Forbes was really serious
about Social Security, he should begin within his own party, where
the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said his plan would fully protect those currently in the
Social Security system and those who would retire in the next 15
years.
</P>
<P>
   Younger people would be offered the choice of whether to stay in
the current system or invest part _ and eventually most _ of the
12.4 percent payroll tax shared by workers and employers in
government-approved 401 (k)-style personal investment accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would give people the opportunity to take their money out
of the hands of the Washington politicians, and invest it in the
real American economy. That way, they'd retire with far more than
they ever could receive under the current system,'' he said, if
returns matched historic stock market performance.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes would exempt the investment earnings from federal taxes.
He would also eliminate the current reduction in Social Security
benefits for recipients who continue earning wages between ages 65
and 69.
</P>
<P>
   Under his plan, workers would determine their own retirement age
without regard to the level of benefits they would receive.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to private retirement benefits, Forbes said a small
portion of the taxes could be used by workers to purchase their own
disability and life insurance benefits.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Forbes is the first major Republican candidate to outline a
proposal for dealing with Social Security, which is projected to be
able to pay full benefits only until 2034. His proposal differs
from that offered by GOP lawmakers in the House, who propose using
the projected federal surplus to finance the individual accounts.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has proposed using a portion of the federal
surplus to reduce the federal debt and credit that reduction toward
the Social Security trust fund. Clinton has also suggested using a
portion of the surplus to offer individual accounts in addition to
the money earmarked for the trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   Gore supports Clinton's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' proposal to replace Social Security with a private
retirement system follows his call in March for reforming the
health care system. He plans to detail his vision of conservatives'
role in the 2000 election in a speech Wednesday in New York. He
speaks this weekend in Georgia on education reform.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes spokesman Greg Mueller told the Associated Press that the
series of speeches reflects Forbes' basic campaign plan: build a
good organization and then focus on the ``politics of substance.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Forbes' opponents, most notably the front-runners, Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas and Elizabeth Dole, have been criticized
for not discussing substantively issues such as Social Security and
health care.

 &HT;    FORBES OFFERS PLAN TO CREATE PRIVATIZE RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS
 &HT;    430&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes
offered a plan Tuesday to let workers to privately invest their
Social Security taxes, and challenged Vice President Al Gore to
debate him on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The union bosses might not like my message very much,'' Forbes
said in a speech to small business owners. ``The special interest
lobbyists in Washington may be a little worried about their job
security. But I can guarantee you that no hard-working union
employee would turn down the chance to double or triple his or her
retirement income.
</P>
<P>
   ``No senior citizen _ no matter what his or her politics _ would
deny their children and grandchildren the opportunity to build real
assets if they knew their own Social Security would be safe and
secure,'' Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes offered to debate Social Security reform with Gore before
audiences of union workers in Michigan, senior citizens in Florida
and Arizona, and blacks and Latinos in California.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lahane, the vice president's spokesman, dismissed Forbes'
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an obvious ploy by a second-tier candidate to get some
attention,'' Lahane said. ``If Steve Forbes was really serious
about Social Security, he should begin within his own party, where
the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said his plan would fully protect those currently in the
Social Security system and those who would retire in the next 15
years.
</P>
<P>
   Younger people would be offered the choice of whether to stay in
the current system or invest part _ and eventually most _ of the
12.4 percent payroll tax shared by workers and employers in
government-approved 401 (k)-style personal investment accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would give people the opportunity to take their money out
of the hands of the Washington politicians, and invest it in the
real American economy. That way, they'd retire with far more than
they ever could receive under the current system,'' he said, if
returns matched historic stock market performance.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes would exempt the investment earnings from federal taxes.
He would also eliminate the current reduction in Social Security
benefits for recipients who continue earning wages between ages 65
and 69.
</P>
<P>
   Under his plan, workers would determine their own retirement age
without regard to the level of benefits they would receive.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to private retirement benefits, Forbes said a small
portion of the taxes could be used by workers to purchase their own
disability and life insurance benefits.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Forbes is the first major Republican candidate to outline a
proposal for dealing with Social Security, which is projected to be
able to pay full benefits only until 2034. His proposal differs
from that offered by GOP lawmakers in the House, who propose using
the projected federal surplus to finance the individual accounts.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has proposed using a portion of the federal
surplus to reduce the federal debt and credit that reduction toward
the Social Security trust fund. Clinton has also suggested using a
portion of the surplus to offer individual accounts in addition to
the money earmarked for the trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   Gore supports Clinton's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' proposal to replace Social Security with a private
retirement system follows his call in March for reforming the
health care system. He plans to detail his vision of conservatives'
role in the 2000 election in a speech Wednesday in New York. He
speaks this weekend in Georgia on education reform.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes spokesman Greg Mueller told the Associated Press that the
series of speeches reflects Forbes' basic campaign plan: build a
good organization and then focus on the ``politics of substance.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Forbes' opponents, most notably the front-runners, Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas and Elizabeth Dole, have been criticized
for not discussing substantively issues such as Social Security and
health care.

RUSSIA'S ACTING PREMIER PRESSES PARLIAMENT ON REFORMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's acting prime minister told parliament on
Tuesday that he would demand a vote of confidence in his new
government if it refused to enact economic reforms on which Western
lenders have conditioned billions of dollars in new loans.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Stepashin, President Boris Yeltsin's choice for prime
minister, issued the pledge as he met with major parties in the
Communist-led lower house of parliament, which will vote Wednesday
on his nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin would replace parliament's hand-picked prime minister,
Yevgeny Primakov, whom Yeltsin abruptly dismissed last week. In
essence, Stepashin is urging the legislators to adopt the economic
package that Primakov negotiated with the International Monetary
Fund before Yeltsin fired him last week.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov had sent the broad outlines of those reforms to
parliament before being fired, but some items were omitted
entirely, and others were watered-down versions of the promises
made to the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF is withholding judgment on the staggered release of $4.5
billion in loans _ enough, basically, to keep Russia from
defaulting on its foreign debt _ until officials see whether
serious reforms are under way. The World Bank has suspended plans
for $3 billion more in loans for infrastructure and social programs
until its board is satisfied that the Stepashin government is
committed to overhauling the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin spoke Tuesday only of the government's promises, and
did not clarify whether he intends to alter the weakened
legislation that Primakov has sent to the parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this package is rejected, the question of confidence in the
government will have to be raised,'' he said, ``since Russia will
fail to honor its commitments to the IMF that were assumed by the
Primakov government.''
</P>
<P>
   Parts of the package _ new taxes on gasoline and vehicles, and
curbs on politically influential banks, for instance _ will be
unpopular with many legislators, who not only are ideologically
against belt-tightening, but also face re-election in December.
</P>
<P>
   But Stepashin put new pressure on the parliament by hitching the
fate of his government to the reforms.
</P>
<P>
   If the legislators were to reject the package, they would be
hard-pressed to justify a vote in favor of his government. But a
vote of no confidence would not only force Stepashin to resign, but
also would give Yeltsin authority to dissolve the parliament and
call early elections.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators have no stomach for another battle with Yeltsin over
the job of prime minister. They have even less appetite for
dissolving parliament, a move which would deprive them of their
legislative soapboxes in the midst of an election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts once believed that the lower house of parliament
would reject Stepashin, a Yeltsin loyalist. But his prospects have
brightened since Yeltsin beat back an impeachment effort last
weekend and legislators began to conclude that the president holds
the upper hand in the choice of Primakov's successor.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of virtually every major faction said they were
satisfied with Stepashin's presentation Tuesday, in which he
stressed the need to fight crime and establish order in the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, meanwhile, was nowhere to be seen Tuesday and was
apparently ill again, though how seriously was not clear. His aides
issued vague and sometimes conflicting statements on his condition
through out the day.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin missed a scheduled morning meeting with Spanisn Prime
Minister Jose Maria Aznar, instead conducting a 45-minute telephone
conversation with Aznar from a country house outside Moscow.
Yeltsin's aides insisted that the meeting was never planned,
despite its appearance Monday on an official schedule.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Spanish government said in an interview that
the Kremlin had canceled the meeting, explaining that Yeltsin was
bedridden with bronchitis.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's spokesman at first denied that, calling it
``absolutely bewildering'' but later, in an interview with the
Reuters news service, declined to either confirm or deny the
report.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish spokesman said that Yeltsin seemed in good health
during the conversation with Aznar and that their conversation was
lively, ``frank and clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, 68, has not been seen in public since Friday. Saturday,
the day that the lower house of parliament voted on five counts of
impeachment against him, Yeltsin visited a Moscow hospital for what
was described as a routine health exam.

<P>
   JUILLAIRD-MUSIC-SCHOOL (New York) _ How do you get to Carnegie
Hall? Practice hard, for sure, but take care, too, that your mental
and spiritual development keeps pace with the physical and
technical, to produce a well-rounded individual and artist. Those,
more or less, are the directions the Juilliard School is giving to
young musicians, dancers and actors hoping to find their way to
Carnegie and other prestigious stages. By James R. Oestreich.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   THEWLIS-BESIEGED-FILM (London) _ When actors sign up for a
movie, they rarely have much notion how it _ or they _ will end up
looking on screen. David Thewlis learned that some years ago with
Mike Leigh. He duly followed the British director's ritual of
spending weeks creating a character down to the tiniest detail. He
won the best actor prize at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival for
``Naked.'' His latest film, Bernardo Bertolucci's ``Besieged,''
which opened in New York on Friday, is a minimalist film set almost
entirely in a Roman palazzo, a love story between two people who
are seldom seen together, who barely exchange words and about whom
we learn little. By Alan Riding.
</P>
<P>
   HUGH-GRANT-FILMS (London) _ Is Hugh Grant, 38, the very model of
a modern English gentleman? He certainly seemed that way in ``Four
Weddings and a Funeral,'' a hugely successful confection of a film
largely kept afloat by his bachelor character's diffident charm,
self-deprecating wit and endearing air of chronic embarrassment.
Now he has been cast in the same mold in ``Notting Hill,'' a
comedy, opening on Friday, in which he plays the divorced, ironical
owner of a sleepy London bookstore whose life is turned upside down
by the sudden appearance of the world's most famous actress, played
by Julia Roberts. By Sarah Lyall.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ENSEMBLE-THEATER (Undated) _ In the last year or so, the London
stage has come to look like a stalker's den or autograph hound's
lair, so marked is the fashion for embellishing productions with
Hollywood faces. But the odd small voice has been heard, asking
what has happened to the principle of ensemble acting, and that
little chorus has recently been joined by a large voice. ``The work
can be the star, the company can be the star,'' declared Trevor
Nunn, director of the National Theater, in March. And he has
proceeded to prove his point with warmly received revivals of
Shakespeare's ``Troilus and Cressida'' and Leonard Bernstein's
musical version of Voltaire's ``Candide.'' These are the opening
offerings in a special season that by late summer will consist of
six plays, involve some 50 actors, and run concurrently with the
other productions in the National's repertory. By Benedict
Nightingale.
</P>
<P>
   RICHARD-NELSON-THEATER (London) _ Displacement and exile are
crucial issues to the American dramatist Richard Nelson, whose
plays, perhaps not coincidentally, usually have their premieres in
England, though their author lives along the Hudson River, north of
New York. Nelson has written about American academics in Britain in
his play ``Some Americans Abroad'' and about Britons living in
America in the more recent ``New England.'' But ``Goodnight
Children Everywhere,'' his latest play, opening Off Broadway on
Wednesday at Playwrights Horizons, marks the first time that Nelson
has written a work wholly about the English and set in England. By
Matt Wolf.
</P>
<P>
   CANBY-THEATER (Undated) _ Theater reviews of ``Via Dolorosa'';
``Amy's View'' and ``The Lonesome West.'' By Vincent Canby.
</P>
<P>
   EAST-IS-EAST-THEATER (London) _ Ayub Khan-Din grew up in the
north of England in suburban Manchester, the eighth of 10 children
born to an English mother and an emigre father from Kashmir,
Pakistan, who between them ran a fish-and-chips shop. The nearest
sibling in the lineup above him was nearly four years older, while
three years separated Khan-Din from his next brother down the row.
And so, recalled the writer and actor, who is now 37: ``I wasn't
part of the older kids or the younger kids. I lived in my own world
and spent a lot of time daydreaming. It paid off in the end.'' For
proof, one need look no further than ``East Is East,'' Khan-Din's
bittersweet, semi-autobiographical comedy about growing up in the
early 1970s in a mixed-race Anglo-Asian household, where there were
often as many as four children to a bed and the toilet was
outdoors. By Matt Wolf.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SARGENT-ART (Boston) _ For half his life, from 1890, when he was
at the height of his career, until his death in 1925, John Singer
Sargent was under contract to produce murals and decorative schemes
for public buildings in Boston. The son of an expatriate New
England doctor, Sargent lived mostly in Europe; but in Boston he
had close friends and family, and he visited often. Boston was the
American city closest to his European sensibility; it understood
him best. And thanks to ``Sargent Summer,'' a series of exhibitions
timed to coincide with the last stop of the Sargent retrospective
at the Museum of Fine Arts (June 27 through Sept. 26), Boston is
once again the city where one can come to a new understanding of
the reticent artist and his art. By Deborah Weisgall.
</P>
<P>
   VIDEO-ARTIST (North Adams, Mass.) _ A new installation will be
introduced here next Sunday by the video artist Tony Oursler.
Titled ``Optics'' and aimed at investigating the origins of sound
and light media, Oursler's new work was commissioned by the
Williams College Museum of Art in nearby Williamstown and the
Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, called colloquially Mass
MOCA. Oursler's work will have its premiere as part of Mass MOCA's
long awaited opening, also next Sunday. By Ann Wilson Lloyd.
</P>
<P>
   CHERMAYETT-PRINTS (East Topsham, Vt.) _ The graphic designer
Ivan Chermayeff, who makes prints from collages of found objects
like old gloves, flattened steel buckets, hole-riddled boards and
rope winders, is now on view at the Ricco/Maresca Gallery in New
York City. By Rita Reif. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY-BLUES-RADIO (Undated) _ Every Saturday night, radio
listeners in Istanbul can hear a voice in heavily accented Turkish
welcome them to another evening of blues music. The announcer says,
``Yalniz gercek blues caliyorum,'' which means, ``I only play real
blues.'' I am that announcer. For the last year I've been feeding
the blues habit of educated listeners and, I hope, bringing ever
more Turks into the worldwide family of blues lovers. By Stephen

GANDHI APPEARS FIRM IN DECISION TO QUIT AS PARTY CHIEF 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Sonia Gandhi stayed behind the high walls of
her heavily guarded compound Tuesday and firmly refused the pleas
of senior Congress Party leaders that she change her mind about
resigning as president of the party.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gandhi, who married into India's dominant political family
and was widowed when her husband, Rajiv, was assassinated eight
years ago, announced Monday that she was quitting after powerful
figures in the party said she should not be prime minister because
she was born in Italy and lacked experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``This morning she seemed even firmer in her resolve than she
did last night,'' said Ambika Soni, of the party's decision-making
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Mrs. Gandhi insisted that her mind is made up, Congress
Party officials orchestrated a series of resignations to pressure
her to return to her post. The party faces a tough general election
in September against the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party,
which has also made Mrs. Gandhi's foreign birth a central campaign
issue.
</P>
<P>
   The entire top echelon of the Congress Party resigned Tuesday
and said they would return only if she relented. Outside the party
headquarters, next door to Mrs. Gandhi's residence, Congress
workers went on a hunger strike to win her back.
</P>
<P>
   And in a symbolic gesture, the chief ministers in the Delhi
capital region, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh submitted their
resignations to Mrs. Gandhi, though they must send the letters to
the governors of their jurisdictions to make their resignations
official.
</P>
<P>
   The party spokesman, Agit Jogi, said no one is even considering
a replacement for her. ``The Congressmen all over the country are
of the view that there is no alternative to Mrs. Sonia Gandhi,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Gandhi told the delegation of party officials who
visited this morning that she did not want her foreign birth to be
a liability.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people think her foreign birth is of such relevance, then
she would like to give up the post,'' Ms. Soni said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharad Pawar, a powerhouse Congress Party politician from
Maharashtra who led the challenge to Mrs. Gandhi's prime
ministerial candidacy, said in Bombay that he would not budge
because ``it's a question of principle, of national interest, of
prestige.''
</P>
<P>
   Political commentators, as well as Mrs. Gandhi's advisers,
debated whether she means to follow through on her resignation, or
is using it as a tactic to consolidate her position after the small
but damaging revolt.
</P>
<P>
   Pran Chopra, an analyst at the Center for Policy Research,
predicted that she would continue resisting the party's entreaties
for awhile, then graciously succumb. ``This is a good way to
fight,'' he said. ``She's got the party fighting for her.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rajiv Desai, who owns a public relations firm in New Delhi
and has served as an adviser to Mrs. Gandhi, said he does not think
she will yield. She did not want to enter politics in the first
place, he noted, and only reluctantly agreed in March 1998 to lead
the party because it seemed to be rapidly disintegrating.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Gandhi, often called the Sphinx, surprised many when
she decided to enter the dirty business of politics _ and she may
yet surprise them again.

 &HT;    Consumers not high on airline service
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The airline industry is now on par with trial lawyers
_ and only slightly above cable TV companies _ in consumer esteem.
</P>
<P>
   That's the conclusion of Consumer Reports magazine's annual
airline service rating in the upcoming June issue.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine jumps on the airline-bashing bandwagon, noting that
``air travelers have become so irate that their treatment at the
hands of airlines has become a national political issue.''
</P>
<P>
   It says service is declining at the biggest carriers, despite
strong profits. Smaller or low-fare carriers now offer comparable
service at better prices, it adds.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine didn't rank airlines numerically but offered a
bottom-line assessment along with category scores.
</P>
<P>
   Of Atlanta-based Delta it said: ``Overall satisfaction has
fallen steeply. . . rarely a low-price leader. . . fewer seats for
frequent fliers than other big airlines.''
</P>
<P>
   A Delta spokesman said the survey may not reflect recent
improvements, notably in on-time performance. Delta handles 80
percent of the traffic at Hartsfield International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The report said rival AirTran ``is about equal to Delta in
overall customer satisfaction, but offers better flight attendant
service and lower fares.''
</P>
<P>
   Highly rated are Midwest Express, a small, all-first-class
carrier based in Milwaukee; no-frills giant Southwest; and
Raleigh-Durham-based Midway.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine combines a variety of measures, including reports
from thousands of Consumer Reports subscribers about flights in
late 1997 and early 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-nine percent were ``highly satisfied,'' down from 52
percent in 1994, the magazine said. ``Based on our other surveys of
consumer services . . . only cable TV companies and commercial diet
programs irked them more.''

 &HT;    AirTran's new plane makes early stop in Atlanta
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The world's next new airliner made a stopover Tuesday
in Atlanta, where it's scheduled to enter service this fall with
discount carrier AirTran.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing 717 is essentially a fourth-generation update of the
venerable DC-9, which now makes up the bulk of AirTran's fleet.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran has orders for 50 of the 117-seat jets, with the first
two due for delivery in September and the rest coming over the next
four years.
</P>
<P>
   An initial production model, already painted in AirTran colors,
is undergoing 10 days of simulated service on the carrier's routes
as part of the flight test program.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran hopes the 717 will lower operating costs and dash its
reputation for flying aged equipment. It displayed the plane
Tuesday morning at Hartsfield International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a tremendous jump for us,'' said Jerry O.
Beatenbaugh, AirTran's director of liaison engineering with Boeing.
``It's more efficient and reliable, and it's brand new.''
</P>
<P>
   By 2004, AirTran says, the 717 will cut its average fleet age to
9.3 years, from 27.5 years now, as DC-9s and 737s are phased out.
</P>
<P>
   The carrier plans a fall ad campaign touting the new jet. Today,
the test jet will be in New York, where AirTran has invited
financial analysts for a ride.
</P>
<P>
   Outwardly the t-tail, twin-engine jet is nearly identical to its
forebears, the DC-9, MD-80 and MD-90.
</P>
<P>
   The chief differences include a new engine, built by BMW Rolls
Royce, and a state-of-the-art cockpit system.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the Stars Wars stuff up here,'' said Beatenbaugh,
sitting in the co-pilot's seat and pointing to flat-panel video
screens that display flight and navigation data.
</P>
<P>
   The plane burns 20 percent less fuel than AirTran's DC-9s and
doesn't require as much upkeep as older planes. The plane was
designed as the MD-95 by McDonnell Douglas Corp. before it was
absorbed by Boeing, which redesignated the jet the 717.
</P>
<P>
   ValuJet, which acquired AirTran and adopted its name in 1997,
was the first airline to order the 717.
</P>
<P>
   The carrier, which has had only two profitable quarters since
1997, is still arranging financing for the $20 million 717s.
</P>
<P>
   Executives contend the costs of buying the planes will be more
than offset by lower operating costs.
</P>
<P>
   Cutbacks at Boeing have prompted speculation it might scrap the
717 program because of weak orders and duplication with the
smallest version of the 737. The company says all programs are
under review this year.
</P>
<P>
   But spokesman Warren Lamb said the 717 is designed for shorter
routes than the 737-600. ``It's a high frequency, up-and-down
airplane,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A 50-plane order from TWA this winter boosted the program's
prospects, and two leasing companies have ordered 15.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Adam.com and Cox Interactive Media, both Atlanta
based, announced a deal that will make Adam the provider of health
care information on more than 30 Internet sites operated by Cox
Interactive.
</P>
<P>
   Adam will develop health care content especially for each of the
local markets served by Cox Interactive, sites that include Access
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The companies will share the revenue generated by the health
care pages, said Robert Cramer, chief executive of Adam.com. ``It's
a real partnership. It lets us provide our advertisers with access
to the local market as well as the national market.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam has of late operated somewhat in the shadow of another
Atlanta-based Internet health care company. WebMD Inc., which only
last week pulled back from a high-profile offering of stock, was
poised late Tuesday to detail a merger with Santa Clara,
Calif.-based Healtheon.
</P>
<P>
   Adam views the deal as a business endorsement that contrasts
with the hoopla about WebMD, Cramer said.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Interactive ``wanted to go with the finest provider of
health care information, and this agreement further established
Adam.com as the leading provider of consumer health information on
the Net.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors have also been coming to Adam's side. Shares of
Adam.com stock, which had slipped slightly Tuesday, reached its
52-week high the day before after a long and steady climb. In
November, Adam was trading as low as $2.25 per share.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Interactive's network includes 25 city sites and three
specialty sites, BlackFamilies.com, FASTBALL.com and
GreatOutdoors.com.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Interactive is a unit of Cox Enterprises, which also owns
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

 &HT;    Track to get safety fences in time for Indy eventBy Mark
Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta Motor Speedway will extend the height of its
wheel fences before hosting an Indy Racing League event in July.
</P>
<P>
   Speedway Motorsports Inc., the Charlotte-based company that owns
the Hampton facility, announced Tuesday that it also will extend
the fences at its tracks in Concord, N.C., Las Vegas and Fort
Worth, Texas, all of which host IRL events.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement comes after a May 2 accident killed three
spectators during an IRL race at Lowe's Motor Speedway in Concord.
Three people were killed and eight injured when debris from a
three-car wreck flew into the stands during the VisionAire 500.
</P>
<P>
   The modifications will extend the total height of the fences at
the tracks from approximately 15 feet to 21 feet and extend the
catch fence over the track surface from approximately three feet to
six.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the responsible thing to do,'' said Ed Clark,
president and general manager of AMS. ``We feel that this is a
quality improvement to an already well-constructed fencing system.
We will continue to work with the IRL, other tracks and the racing
community in an effort to make racing events as safe as possible
for all involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press also is reporting that the IRL will begin
requiring wheel-tether systems at next week's Indianapolis 500 in
response to the sport's latest fatal accident involving spectators.
But IRL officials refused Tuesday to confirm their intentions to
start making their teams use restraining cables designed to do a
better job of keeping wheels from snapping free from the vehicles
on impact.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Gapens, spokesman for Lowe's Motor Speedway, said the
taller fences would be installed at his facility before the May 30
Coca-Cola 600 NASCAR race.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the windowless Situation Room beneath the White
House West Wing, President Clinton and his senior national security
team gathered late Monday around a large wooden table to take up
the harrowing nightmare that is Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In black leather armchairs in the dark paneled chamber sat
Madeleine Albright, William Cohen, Samuel Berger, Gen. Hugh Shelton
and a handful of other architects of a high stakes policy bearing
the ominous earmarks of a grim and unmitigated debacle.
</P>
<P>
   From Defense Secretary Cohen and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman
Shelton came the update on an air campaign that, after two months
and some 22,000 sorties and more than 10,000 bombs, has seriously
damaged but failed to root out, destroy or even significantly
reduce the estimated 40,000 Serb troops and police that have
ravaged Kosovo in the single worst military onslaught unleashed on
European soil since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   From Secretary of State Albright came the latest on an equally
grisly diplomatic toll: fractured U.S. relations with the world's
most populous nation, China, and the politically and economically
addled possessor of the world's second-largest nuclear arsenal,
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   National Security Advisor Berger pondered the risks of pressing
forward with a campaign hamstrung by the limits of coalition air
power, undercut by hundreds of civilian casualties and stalked at
every turn by the capricious laws of unintended consequences.
</P>
<P>
   And unseen but just as surely present hung the ghastly human
toll of Kosovo, where Serbs have forced an estimated 1.3 million
ethnic Albanians to flee their homes, raped or executed thousands
more, and sacked to ash and rubble more than 300 villages in a tiny
province no larger than the state of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Adjourning what must have been one of the most somber meetings
of his political career, Clinton concluded that there was no
alternative but to press forward with air raids and hope for a
diplomatic breakthrough that might bring the conflict to an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very hopeful, obviously, that the diplomatic efforts that
are being made in the State Department and with the Russians will
bear some fruit,'' Clinton told reporters at the White House on
Tuesday. ``But, if they do not, we will continue to press ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago Wednesday, solemn but resolute, Clinton sat in
the Oval Office and explained to the American people why U.S. and
allied warplanes had launched cruise missiles and smart bombs
against Yugoslav forces in the embattled province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We act to protect thousands of innocent people in Kosovo from
a mounting military offensive,'' Clinton said, hauling out colorful
maps to try to help viewers figure out where Kosovo is and why it
matters to the American Heartland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ending this tragedy is a moral imperative,'' Clinton said.
Without NATO action, he added, ``There would be many more massacres
-- tens of thousands more refugees, more victims crying out for
revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Judged strictly by the noble mission enshrined in Clinton's own
words, the NATO campaign to combat Serb aggression has fallen
nothing short of disaster to many military and diplomatic
observers.
</P>
<P>
   Since the NATO strikes began on March 24, an estimated 90
percent of the majority ethnic Albanians in Kosovo have been forced
by terror to flee their homes in the worst mass exodus to haunt
Europe since the collapse of Nazi Germany.
</P>
<P>
   More than 800,000 have taken refuge outside of Kosovo; the rest
are hiding, and probably starving, inside the province, with no
near-term prospects for meaningful relief, according to the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has estimated that more than 4,000 ethnic
Albanians have been executed inside Kosovo -- though impossible to
independently confirm, refugees have given eyewitness accounts of
massacres in more than 70 separate villages and towns -- and up to
100,000 more are missing.
</P>
<P>
   If this is what Clinton had in mind when he launched the strikes
against Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic, president of Yugoslavia, he
gave no indication of it then.
</P>
<P>
   ``If President Milosevic will not make peace, we will limit his
ability to make war,'' Clinton assured the country. ``Hopefully Mr.
Milosevic will realize his present course is self-destructive and
unsustainable.''
</P>
<P>
   What White House officials had hoped would be three or four days
of air strikes, though, has turned instead into an escalating
aerial war of attrition waged against a determined and dispersed
ground force hunkered down for a long stand off against NATO
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the daily attempts by the U.S. and NATO public relations
shops to put the best possible face on the operation, the policy
experts struggling to manage the campaign and its fallout concede
that they are struggling to rescue a mission beset by a long string
of enormous setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like trying to judge the outcome of a game at the end of
the second quarter,'' said Deputy National Security Advisor James
Steinberg, maintaining that it's still too early to render a
verdict on the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And, said Steinberg, to the extent the going's been tough, the
United States and its NATO allies had no real choice but to strike
at Milosevic's military regime and hope for the best on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a problem that had to be solved,'' Steinberg said in a
telephone interview. ``If you're going to have a stable Europe, you
have to take this on, you can't just wish it away.''

California's reduced welfare benefits for newcomers to the state,
the court relied on a portion of the 14th amendment that forbids
states to ``abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the
United States.'' This is the long-neglected privileges or

 &HT;    Georgia school tries to reach championship milestone
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Kennesaw State University is one of only two schools
in the nation to win baseball and softball national titles in the
same season. This spring, the school is only a few victories away
from accomplishing the feat for the second time.
</P>
<P>
   The softball team begins play in the eight-team Division II
championship series Thursday in Salem, Va. while the baseball team
continues its quest for a national title Sunday in the eight-team
Division II World Series in Montgomery. The baseball team (46-12),
coached by Mike Sansing, is ranked No. 1, while Scott Whitlock's
softball team takes a 50-5 record and the No. 2 ranking into its
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The two teams have dominated Division II competition in recent
years, the softball team winning consecutive national titles in
1995 and 1996 and the baseball team winning the 1996 title. The
national titles in '96 matched Cal-State Northridge, which won both
Division II titles in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The baseball team, which won the NAIA national title in 1994
before moving to Division II, earned its fourth consecutive berth
in the championship series by winning the South Atlantic Regional
title in Jacksonville last weekend. Led by senior outfielder Jason
Jones, the two-time South Atlantic player of the year, the KSU Owls
hope to improve on last year's national runner-up finish when they
begin tournament play Sunday against Carson Newman (42-12-2).
</P>
<P>
   The softball team, which knocked off No. 1-ranked Columbus State
and Coker in winning the South Atlantic Regional at home last
weekend, will be appearing in the national tournament for the
fourth time in the past five years. Led by All-American pitcher
Christina Caldwell, Kennesaw State will face Merrimack College
(42-4) of North Andover, Mass., on Thursday.

 &HT;    Record profits enjoyed by Home Depot
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta-based Home Depot Inc. said first-quarter
profit rose a record 45 percent as customers spent more on building
materials, flooring and home decor.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street's response on Tuesday was comparatively mild. The
stock rose 18 3/4 cents to $58.62 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   Net income rose to $489 million, or 32 cents a share, from $337
million, or 22 cents, a year earlier. Home Depot was expected to
earn 28 cents a share, according to an average estimate of analysts
polled by First Call Corp. Home Depot has beaten profit forecasts
five quarters in a row and 15 out of the past 21, according to
First Call.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue rose 26 percent to $8.95 billion from $7.12 billion.
Sales at stores open at least a year rose 9 percent. Same-store
sales are a key indicator of a retailer's business because they
don't include new, renovated or closed stores. Specifically, stores
in Atlanta and Dallas were strong performers, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Mortgage rates near 7 percent and rising wages are fueling the
housing market, and sales of existing homes reached a record pace
in March. That drives new customers to Home Depot for lights,
wallpaper and other supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Customers showed a preference for pricier goods in the first
quarter, the company said. The average sale rose 6 percent to $48
as customers tended to buy higher quality products. Average weekly
sales per store rose to $878,000 from $854,000.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot's new focus on hiring tradesmen is paying off, said
Ron Brill, executive vice president and chief administrative
officer. Those experienced employees typically sell higher-margin
merchandise, which offsets a spike in wages Home Depot is forced to
pay as it looks for qualified people in a tight labor market, Brill
said.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot, the largest home improvement retailer, continues to
take market share from rival chains that close stores. Home Depot
has an estimated 18 percent share of the $170 billion-a-year U.S.
home-improvement market.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot ended the quarter with nearly 800 stores, including
eight Expo Design Centers. A new concept dubbed Villager's Hardware
opens next month in East Brunswick, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Lowe's Companies Inc., the No. 2 home improvement
retailer, reported a 24 percent increase in first quarter earnings,
including a one-time charge.
</P>
<P>
   The retail industry in general is enjoying a strong first
quarter. Of the 97 retailers that have reported results so far this
quarter, more than 70 percent beat earnings forecasts, according to
First Call.

ravaged Kosovo in the single worst military onslaught unleashed on
European soil since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   From Secretary of State Albright came the latest on an equally
grisly diplomatic toll: fractured U.S. relations with the world's
most populous nation, China, and the politically and economically
addled possessor of the world's second-largest nuclear arsenal,
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   National Security Advisor Berger pondered the risks of pressing
forward with a campaign hamstrung by the limits of coalition air
power, undercut by hundreds of civilian casualties and stalked at
every turn by the capricious laws of unintended consequences.
</P>
<P>
   And unseen but just as surely present hung the ghastly human
toll of Kosovo, where Serbs have forced an estimated 1.3 million
ethnic Albanians to flee their homes, raped or executed thousands
more, and sacked to ash and rubble more than 300 villages in a tiny
province no larger than the state of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Adjourning what must have been one of the most somber meetings
of his political career, Clinton concluded that there was no
alternative but to press forward with air raids and hope for a
diplomatic breakthrough that might bring the conflict to an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very hopeful, obviously, that the diplomatic efforts that
are being made in the State Department and with the Russians will
bear some fruit,'' Clinton told reporters at the White House on
Tuesday. ``But, if they do not, we will continue to press ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago Wednesday, solemn but resolute, Clinton sat in
the Oval Office and explained to the American people why U.S. and
allied warplanes had launched cruise missiles and smart bombs
against Yugoslav forces in the embattled province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We act to protect thousands of innocent people in Kosovo from
a mounting military offensive,'' Clinton said, hauling out colorful
maps to try to help viewers figure out where Kosovo is and why it
matters to the American Heartland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ending this tragedy is a moral imperative,'' Clinton said.
Without NATO action, he added, ``There would be many more massacres
-- tens of thousands more refugees, more victims crying out for
revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Judged strictly by the noble mission enshrined in Clinton's own
words, the NATO campaign to combat Serb aggression has fallen
nothing short of disaster to many military and diplomatic
observers.
</P>
<P>
   Since the NATO strikes began on March 24, an estimated 90
percent of the majority ethnic Albanians in Kosovo have been forced
by terror to flee their homes in the worst mass exodus to haunt
Europe since the collapse of Nazi Germany.
</P>
<P>
   More than 800,000 have taken refuge outside of Kosovo; the rest
are hiding, and probably starving, inside the province, with no
near-term prospects for meaningful relief, according to the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has estimated that more than 4,000 ethnic
Albanians have been executed inside Kosovo -- though impossible to
independently confirm, refugees have given eyewitness accounts of
massacres in more than 70 separate villages and towns -- and up to
100,000 more are missing.
</P>
<P>
   If this is what Clinton had in mind when he launched the strikes
against Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic, president of Yugoslavia, he
gave no indication of it then.
</P>
<P>
   ``If President Milosevic will not make peace, we will limit his
ability to make war,'' Clinton assured the country. ``Hopefully Mr.
Milosevic will realize his present course is self-destructive and
unsustainable.''
</P>
<P>
   What White House officials had hoped would be three or four days
of air strikes, though, has turned instead into an escalating
aerial war of attrition waged against a determined and dispersed
ground force hunkered down for a long stand off against NATO
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the daily attempts by the U.S. and NATO public relations
shops to put the best possible face on the operation, the policy
experts struggling to manage the campaign and its fallout concede
that they are struggling to rescue a mission beset by a long string
of enormous setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like trying to judge the outcome of a game at the end of
the second quarter,'' said Deputy National Security Advisor James
Steinberg, maintaining that it's still too early to render a
verdict on the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And, said Steinberg, to the extent the going's been tough, the
United States and its NATO allies had no real choice but to strike
at Milosevic's military regime and hope for the best on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a problem that had to be solved,'' Steinberg said in a
telephone interview. ``If you're going to have a stable Europe, you
have to take this on, you can't just wish it away.''

FEDERAL RESERVE SIGNALS IT IS LEANING TOWARD HIGHER INTEREST
RATES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Reserve put investors and consumers on
notice Tuesday that it might raise interest rates in coming months
if it continues to see signs of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Although it voted to hold rates steady for now, the central
bank's policymaking Federal Open Market Committee dropped its
neutral stance on monetary policy, under which it considered the
possibility of rate cuts and rate increases to be equally likely.
Instead, it said it was leaning toward imposing higher rates.
</P>
<P>
   The shift was subtle, but it signaled a clear change in the
Federal Reserve's outlook following three interest rate reductions
last fall in response to the global financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the committee said it was ``concerned about the
potential for a buildup of inflationary imbalances that could
undermine the favorable performance of the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors and economists, who considered the odds of such a
shift roughly 50-50, were well prepared for the announcement, which
came just after 2:15 p.m. Tuesday. It rattled Wall Street, but only
briefly. Stocks, which had been up modestly, turned down before
recovering most of their losses. Bond prices fell, and the dollar
dipped slightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fed took a step without tightening policy, and signaled to
investors in an orderly fashion where they think the risks lie,''
said Joel Prakken, an economist at Macroeconomic Advisors, a
consulting firm. ``They're saying the economy is going too fast
given how low the unemployment rate is.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the move was intended to show that the Federal
Reserve is no longer so worried about a global downturn or a credit
squeeze in the financial markets, and is increasingly concerned by
the possibility that strong domestic growth at a time of low
unemployment could set off an inflationary spiral in prices and
wages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The odds are high, although far from 100 percent, that an
upward move in interest rates is coming,'' said Allen Sinai, chief
global economist at Primark Decision Economics, a consulting firm.
``Quite properly and early, the central bank has shifted focus to a
potential inflationary buildup in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   The move came on the heels of the report on Friday that the
Consumer Price Index had risen 0.7 percent in April, the biggest
jump since 1990. And it came just two weeks after Alan Greenspan,
the Federal Reserve chairman, warned in a speech that inflation
remained a threat despite the tremendous economic gains stimulated
by huge investments in new technology during the course of a
business expansion that is now in its ninth year.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing and explaining the move following its meeting
Tuesday, the central bank was employing for the first time a policy
it adopted last fall of revealing shifts in its intentions
immediately. Previously, except when it actually raised or lowered
interest rates, the Federal Reserve had kept changes in its policy
stance secret until after the subsequent meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The new disclosure policy was adopted partly in response to
longstanding calls from Congress and the markets for the Fed to be
more open. But it also gives the Fed more flexibility in preparing
investors and the public for rate changes and avoiding sharp,
destabilizing swings in stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   Economists said the Fed could raise rates as soon as its next
policy meeting at the end of next month, especially if there are
further signs of inflation or a further drop in unemployment from
its current rate of 4.3 percent. But economists said that if the
economy begins to cool on its own, the Fed would likely hold off on
any rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   The main short-term rate controlled by the Federal Reserve, the
Federal funds target rate on overnight loans between banks, stands
at 4.75 percent. The discount rate on loans from the Federal
Reserve system to the banks is 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The American economy has been defying predictions of a slowdown
for several years _ it grew at a robust 4.5 percent pace in the
first quarter _ yet until now has generated almost no concrete
signs of incipient inflation despite a declining unemployment rate.
In many ways, the spike in consumer prices last month is an
anomaly, because prices at the producer level, wages and other
indicators of potential bottlenecks, like the portion of factory
capacity being used, show few or no signs of worrisome increases.
</P>
<P>
   Within the Fed, and among economists generally, the situation
has set off a debate about whether the economy can now grow for
sustained periods at higher rates without generating inflation that
traditional models would suggest. Greenspan has been among those
who have made the case that technology-driven increases in
productivity _ or the amount of output generated per worker _ have
improved the economy's non-inflationary growth capacity and allowed
the Fed to avoid rate increases, with one exception, for more than
four years.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenspan has made clear that his faith in productivity
improvements has its limits, and he is apparently reaching them
now.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan and his colleagues on the policy committee, some of
whom have been far less sanguine about inflation than he, also
confront a reviving world economy, and a domestic stock market that
has left people from all walks of life feeling affluent and willing
to spend. As a result, demand is likely to remain strong or
intensify while pressure for wage increases is likely to grow.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed is also facing a rebound in oil prices, which had been
falling or depressed for several years, helping to contain
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In its statement Tuesday, the committee acknowledged that
``increases in costs and core prices have generally remained quite
subdued'' apart from last month's jump in consumer prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``But domestic financial markets have recovered and foreign
economic prospects have improved since the easing of monetary
policy last fall,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Against the background of already tight domestic labor markets
and ongoing strength in demand in excess of productivity gains, the
committee recognizes the need to be alert to developments over
coming months that might indicate that financial conditions might
no longer be consistent with containing inflation,'' the statement
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There are clearly dangers for the Fed in raising rates,
especially if the increase is seen in the markets and among the
public as hasty. Without any clear evidence of inflation, a rate
increase could fuel political criticism of the Fed and bring
protests from sectors of the economy, like manufacturing and
agriculture, that have been missing out on the general prosperity
of the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   A rate increase could also drive the value of the dollar higher
against other currencies, making imports relatively more attractive
and making it harder for American exporters to compete in foreign
markets. That could make the trade deficit, which has been
expanding rapidly, even worse.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed also has to be careful not to unsettle the stock market
too much. Although Greenspan has made clear for several years now
that he thinks stock prices may be too high, Fed officials are well
aware that if higher rates puncture the market in a way that leads
to a steep drop, it could pinch off consumer spending and risk
putting the economy into a stall.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, though, the committee's statement Tuesday
seemed intended in part to dispel the notion that has become
popular among some economists in the last few months that Greenspan
and his colleagues are less inclined to strike at inflation before
it takes root and more likely to wait until they have concrete
evidence of its return before raising rates.

FRENZIED WALL STREET HAS HUMBLE ROOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA BASS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DANVILLE, Calif. _ On May 17, 1792, some two dozen brokers,
accustomed to casually meeting on lower Wall Street to exchange
brandy, gossip and bonds, decided to make their arrangement
permanent.
</P>
<P>
   The result of this humble agreement evolved, over time, into the
U.S. securities market. It is the most beloved, hated, feared,
respected and closely watched (never more than at this very moment)
financial community of all time.
</P>
<P>
   Few institutions so perfectly capture the pulse of this decade
as the American securities industry. Dot coms, day traders, Dow
11,000; 80 million Americans owning equities _ all inconceivable 10
years ago _ are today merely part of the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons our consumer-driven economy is so strong is
the ``wealth effect'' _ the direct result of our investments in the
booming bull market of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   That the securities market so typifies '90s America should not
be surprising. The market has reflected the nature and trends of
the U.S. economy right from the start.
</P>
<P>
   For its first 100 years, however, that economy was decidedly
different from today's. Modern corporate structure was unknown; so
was globalization; so was mass consumption.
</P>
<P>
   The market also was different, trading mostly in canal issues
and railroads and long-term government bonds; on one day _ March
16, 1830 _ only 31 shares were traded. The market was different in
other ways, too. Brokers, for instance, were forbidden to spit
(which hasn't changed, but it's no longer a written rule.)
</P>
<P>
   The modern securities market emerged rather late in the 19th
century, when a slew of new and capital-hungry industries _
petroleum, rubber, telephone, steel _ shifted investor interest
into manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   Until World War I, though, most investors were professionals _
financial sophisticates working out of banks or large investment
houses and armed with insider information (or so they hoped).
</P>
<P>
   It was only when war began that the general public entered the
market, mostly through Liberty Bonds sold by the federal government
to help finance military expenses. Nonprofessional investors
relished the Liberty Bond experience. They not only made money but
got credit for being patriotic. When the war ended, they sought to
repeat it, through increasingly fevered involvement in the
securities market.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1920s, that market was on fire, with intense public
interest, shrieking financial headlines and seesawing closing
averages. (Sound familiar?)
</P>
<P>
   More and more businesses, some very well-known, turned to the
market for financing. General Motors, Sears and Union Carbide were
all added to the Dow during this period, joining General Electric _
the oldest Dow member _ and AT&AMP;T. Trading on margin was common _
even encouraged _ as first-time investors, following glib advice
pumped out by so-called experts, groped their way toward a
seemingly limitless future.
</P>
<P>
   The future arrived in 1929 with a crash, plunging the nation
into the Depression and a decade of financial despair. Even today
it haunts (or ought to) the most optimistic investor.
</P>
<P>
   Could it happen again? Parallels between the '20s and '90s are
creepily striking. Both decades are noted for great economic growth
and sound fundamentals; both are noted, further, for rapid
consolidation, increasing globalization and new forms of economic
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Most noteworthy of all, however, is how strongly our
generation's fascination with new technology stocks (eBay and
amazon.com) echoes the '20s speculation in its new technologies:
radio, airplanes and motion pictures, especially talkies.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, just like today, many of the hottest stocks of that
era had shockingly (for their time) high price/earnings ratios and
_ equally shocking, and equally familiar today _ no actual
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   But while the question _ could it happen again? _ is worth
repeating, it actually isn't the question we need to ask. For
keeping in mind that the history of the American securities market
has always been, over time, the history of the economy itself, the
real question is: Over the long term, how will the economy do?
</P>
<P>
   For those who believe (and many do) we have entered a new
economic era, then Dow 20,000 already is on the horizon; you should
stop reading this column at once, run to your phone or computer,
and make some investments.
</P>
<P>
   As for those who believe the opposite _ who fear our economy
rests on too much easy money, that inflation has not been tamed,
and that disaster is only an Alan Greenspan comment away _ you
should find out what selling short means.

KANEMATSU, AILING JAPANESE CONGLOMERATE, PLANS MAJOR DOWNSIZING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Kanematsu Corp., a large and financially troubled
Japanese trading conglomerate, on Tuesday announced a three-year
plan to cut more than half of its work force of 17,000, spin off or
farm out assets, and seek forgiveness of more than $3 billion of
bank debt.
</P>
<P>
   The plan announced by Kanematsu officials at a news conference
was one of the most radical overhauls of a major Japanese business
struggling with the country's long recession.
</P>
<P>
   The job cutbacks _ including two-thirds of 1,938 positions at
the parent company _ were taken as an indication that Japan's
unemployment rate, which has reached a new record high almost every
month since the beginning of the year, would continue climbing.
</P>
<P>
   Once a symbol of Japan's economic might, the trading companies
in particular have struggled in recent years because of heavy debts
they had amassed to diversify beyond a now-dwindling role as
middlemen in the global movement of goods.
</P>
<P>
   Kanematsu, the ninth-largest trading company, was known to be in
trouble. But the magnitude of its job reductions and other cutbacks
was considered a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had suspected that the company was effectively bankrupt
since it posted weak six-month results last fall, and its
acknowledgment that it would need the assistance of major creditors
to get back on its feet, including the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi,
validated their suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   Kanematsu president Masao Yosomiya said he would ask banks to
forgive 370 billion yen in debts, or more than $3 billion.
Kanematsu may also try to get its banks and affiliated companies to
buy 20 billion yen in new shares, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The trading company sharply lowered its earnings estimate for
the fiscal year that ended on March 31 _ to 100 million yen, or
$811,000 at current exchange rates, from 3 billion yen, or $24.3
million, saying it would have special charges related to its
affiliated companies.
</P>
<P>
   It also reduced its revenue forecast to 2.25 billion yen, a 16.7
percent decline from the previous forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Kanematsu shares plummeted 26 percent in Tokyo on Tuesday
closing at 97 yen.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its overhaul, the company will spin off its
relatively strong textile business and hand over various operations
to affiliates, including chemicals, industrial machinery and the
marketing of fuel and steel products.
</P>
<P>
   The number of companies in the group will be reduced to 70 from
the current 230 through mergers, sales and outright liquidation.
</P>
<P>
   After all the cutting, Kanematsu will focus on food,
telecommunications, electronics, metals and chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're chopping the fish into several pieces and hoping some
of the pieces will swim,'' said Matt Aizawa, an analyst who follows
the biggest Japanese trading companies for Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Moody's Investors Service lowered its rating on Kanematsu's
senior debt and said it would keep the company's ratings under
review with an eye toward a further downgrading. ``The rating
downgrade reflects the quickly deteriorating business and financial
fundamentals of the company,'' Moody's said in a statement. ``The
continuing review will focus on the level of financial support from
its bank lenders and the anticipated results of its restructuring
plan.''

   GANDERKESEE, Germany _ Into a stinking mixture of potato peels,
apple cores, animal excrement, grass, wilting cabbage and rotten
carrots, Gerald Vollmer-Heuer casually tossed about 100,000 German
marks, or $57,000.
</P>
<P>
   He smiled, asked a visitor to excuse the stench and watched the
long-prized symbol of Germany's economic virility disappear into a
heaving mound of refuse chugging along a conveyor belt. Nothing
more natural in the world, for this corporate director, than the
notion of turning Europe's most trusted currency into compost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mark will enrich our soil, as it once enriched our
lives,'' he said. ``It contains carbon and cellulose that are good
for my production process. Waste tends to be damp, and the paper
absorbs the dampness.''
</P>
<P>
   These are trying times in Europe. A war in the Balkans is being
prosecuted, with unhappy results, by a group of leaders who spent
their youths denouncing war as wrong. The buoyant U.S. economy
amounts to a daily dose of depressant for a lethargic continent.
Young people cannot find jobs. A man could be forgiven for going
mad.
</P>
<P>
   But for all his hilarity as he sprinkles marks into muck,
Vollmer-Heuer is sane. Germany, like most countries in the
15-member European Union, has decided to eliminate its currency by
2002 in favor of the nascent common currency, the euro. That plan
has raised the question of what to do with 2,600 tons of German
mark bills.
</P>
<P>
   That may seem a simple question. Burn them. Shred them and dump
them in a landfill site. Sell them to some American collector as
souvenirs of Germany's stunning reconstruction after World War II.
Recycle them as toilet paper or official stationery for the
European Central Bank in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   But no. This being ecological, earnest Germany, nothing is quite
that simple. The bills contain oils and waxes that make them
water-resistant but also make them impossible to recycle. Landfill
sites are expensive. The Bundesbank does not want the onetime pride
of Germany ending up on souvenir stands in Florida. And burning is
wasteful.
</P>
<P>
   So the notion of the mark-as-manure has emerged, and nobody, as
yet, is being sniffy about it. Indeed, it is being viewed with
great seriousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, if you think of the smell and what goes into
compost, it is not that nice,'' said Karl Schnitzler, a spokesman
for the Bavarian State Central Bank, the institution that will
decide on the mark's fate. ``But if you think that compost is a
stimulus to growth, then it is quite a nice symbol.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. Still, it is mildly shocking, and more than mildly
nauseating, to watch the famous bills _ shredded into 800 pieces
each before 60 million marks ($34.2 million) were given to
Vollmer-Heuer's Environmental Protection North plant in this
northern German town on a trial basis _ sitting like confetti on a
sea of putrid filth. The money consists of old bills that are being
withdrawn from circulation.
</P>
<P>
   A man with a protective mask over the lower part of his face
pulls impurities like glass and plastic from the muck. ``You
wouldn't believe the things we pull out,'' Vollmer-Heuer said.
``Dead dogs, dead cats, old spades. People are crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Crazy is the word that Dirk Adolf, the technical director of a
waste recycling company called GFU, thinks appropriate for the
mark-to-compost proposal. He has another idea that came to him
while treating labels from bottles.
</P>
<P>
   These labels, he found, are useful for making tiny bullet-like
pellets about 10 millimeters long and 3 millimeters thick.
</P>
<P>
   Now what, it is legitimate to ask, is the use of tiny
bullet-like pellets made from discarded bottle labels? Well, Adolf
is able to sell them to the construction industry, which puts them
into bricks. As the brick is fired, the pellets inside burn _
creating a lighter brick with unusual insulation qualities.
</P>
<P>
   Pellets made of bottle labels could equally well be made of
billions of dollars' worth of shredded marks. That, at least, is
Adolf's proposal. ``Compost is a lousy end for the mark,'' he said.
``It is cheap, it is degrading, it is smelly. What I propose is
something clean, useful and solid.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Bavarian State Central Bank, the marks-to-bricks idea is
also getting appropriate consideration. If compost, at a stretch,
can symbolize growth, bricks are an obvious symbol of stability,
the very essence of the mark during its postwar life and the most
desired quality for its successor, the euro.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stability of bricks is very interesting to us,''
Schnitzler said. ``This is a useful idea. We will make a decision
on the two proposals by the end of the year. Of course, we could
give some to compost and some to bricks.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a fudge would, of course, have the advantage of symbolizing
growth and stability, both much needed in Europe these days. But
Vollmer-Heuer is determined to get the entire load.
</P>
<P>
   After it emerges from sorting on the conveyor belts, his refuse
is stored and periodically churned for at least two weeks in
tunnel-like containers where the humidity is 100 percent and the
temperature about 125 degrees. Further sifting follows, and after
about 12 weeks a fine, odorless compost is ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a ratio of 10 percent of shredded bills to other waste, our
typical sack of compost will contain bills worth about 200,000
marks,'' he said. ``That is rich stuff and it is good for
Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   But what Germans now believe will be good for Germany is a solid
euro. Having fretted over the loss of the beloved mark, they now
give it little thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Building pellets or manure, the question is secondary,'' said
Schnitzler of the Bavarian State Central Bank. ``The mark will soon
be history, and what matters is the stability of the currency in
use.''

 &HT;    Q and A with Elizabeth Dole
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Va. _ Elizabeth Dole will bring her undeclared
campaign for the Republican presidential nomination to the Georgia
GOP convention in Augusta Saturday. In advance of that appearance,
Dole, 62, talked from her campaign headquarters overlooking the
Potomac River in Arlington, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The magnificent view from her office window includes
Washington's National Cathedral, where, she pointed out, she and
former Sen. Bob Dole were married more than 23 years ago. Her
husband provided some unwelcome news this week, voicing concern
about Dole's campaign and telling a reporter that he would like to
give money to a rival.
</P>
<P>
   Dole laughed when the interview began with a question about her
husband:
</P>
<P>
   Q: I hadn't planned to start with this...but what is he up to?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, he's had a little trip to the woodshed, the Dole
woodshed. But the bottom line, as they say, is the interpretation
was not what he intended. He's been out there for so long now
talking about me. He's been very, very supportive. He is prepared
to help in any way to see this happen...He looked pretty good in
the woodshed, though.
</P>
<P>
   Q: He hasn't been . . .
</P>
<P>
   A: Visible.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is that going to change?
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh, yes. Definitely. But he and I both feel it's best for me
to establish myself solo early on. That's the plan. I think that
makes sense. He was the nominee of the party last time. It is my
effort. Bob is in no way directing it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When do you expect to make a decision about whether you are
going to be a candidate? Have you already?
</P>
<P>
   A: You know, I am still in the exploratory stage, but I have
directed my staff to be looking ahead, to be making plans that
maybe mid-summer or early fall we'd move into the next phase.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The issues you've highlighted so far (particularly a more
inclusive view on abortion and support for gun control) have
certainly not been the typical path toward the Republican
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   A: My belief is, you say ... what you think and even people who
disagree with you, they'll respect you for being consistent...I
can't believe there is any reason a person would need an AK-47 or
an Uzi to defend their family or hunt. That to me is a reasonable,
solid position. No reason for any form of cop killer bullets ... I
think my position in New Hampshire was vindicated in terms of child
safety locks because we see the Senate right now very likely to
move forward with mandatory child safety locks. That makes a big
difference in terms of accidental deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Q: On the abortion issue... one of the ways to influence policy
on abortion is to appoint judges who are... pro-life. Are you
willing to make that statement?
</P>
<P>
   A: My view is that you appoint people who are as highly
qualified as you can find, who have the right qualifications,
credentials, skills. I would expect them to share my judicial
philosophy, which is you interpet the Constitution, you don't
legislate from the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In 1996, there were stories that you were more acceptable to
social conservatives than your husband was. This time around, at
least early on, that doesn't seem to be.
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm not a person who puts my finger up to the wind...My
passion doesn't come from polling. I'm going to speak what I
believe. There may be people in my party who don't agree with that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You're the first woman (to be a) serious candidate for the
presidency...
</P>
<P>
   A: I've been on the cutting edge in many different positions in
30 years of service to the public...I was the only woman on the
Federal Trade Commission, but I was not regarded as the woman
commissioner. ..I was the first woman to head the Department of
Transportation and I did ask, because it was very much
male-dominated, how many women did we have in the department...They
said 19 percent were female. At the time they established the
department, it was 18 1/2 percent. They had come up half a
percentage point (in 14 years).
</P>
<P>
   Q: You're going to Georgia this weekend. Are Southerners ready
to vote for a woman for president?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think so. From everything I've heard, yes. The country is
ready and that includes my home territory.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Even some of your supporters in Georgia...intimate that it
wouldn't be such a bad thing if there were a Bush-Dole ticket...
</P>
<P>
   A: Let me clear that up right now... I'm not in this to be vice
president.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 23)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every Saturday night, radio listeners in Istanbul can hear a
voice in heavily accented Turkish welcome them to another evening
of blues music. The announcer says, ``Yalniz gercek blues
caliyorum,'' which means, ``I only play real blues.''
</P>
<P>
   I am that announcer. For the last year I've been feeding the
blues habit of educated listeners and, I hope, bringing ever more
Turks into the worldwide family of blues lovers.
</P>
<P>
   My show, ``Smokestack Lightnin','' is hardly the first or only
blues show in Turkey. Istanbul is one of the world's most vibrant
and sophisticated cities, and many people here are tuned in to
world culture just as completely as their cousins in London or
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   But as far as I know, I am the first American host of a blues
show in Turkey, the first disk jockey here who not only features
artists like Lightnin' Hopkins, Alberta Hunter, Roosevelt Sykes,
Big Joe Turner and Muddy Waters but who has actually had the
privilege of seeing them perform. All those nights at Boston-area
clubs and college auditoriums in the '60s turned out not to be so
misspent after all.
</P>
<P>
   A generation of Turks has grown up hearing blues-influenced
musicians like Eric Clapton, Johnny Winter and the Blues Brothers.
I don't play music by any of them. My show concentrates on ``real
blues,'' which turns out to mean music that many Turks have never
heard before.
</P>
<P>
   When I first planned my show, I resolved that any artist I
featured would have to fit two categories: black and dead. I've
eased up on the second restriction and have happily featured the
likes of Otis Rush, Honeyboy Edwards and Billy Boy Arnold, not to
mention immortals like John Lee Hooker.
</P>
<P>
   But the only time I broke down and played white musicians was on
a special show dedicated to Robert Johnson; I interspersed his
originals with versions sung by John Hammond, Rory Block and other
gifted contemporary interpreters.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for this is not any kind of exclusionary elitism. My
mission is to broaden the knowledge and taste of my audience. I
want to let listeners know that Mick Jagger did not come up with
``Little Red Rooster'' and that ``Back Door Man'' was not a Jim
Morrison original. (Willie Dixon wrote them both, by the way.)
</P>
<P>
   I try to reach back into blues history and play songs that
reflect the rich variety of this great music. Usually I start with
some uptempo numbers by artists like Little Walter or Howlin' Wolf.
But then I like to dig deeper into my collection. Robert Pete
Williams, Son House, Sleepy John Estes, the Rev. Gary Davis and
Blind Boy Fuller are all regular guests. ``Eski blues en iyi
blues,'' I like to say. ``Old blues is the best blues.''
</P>
<P>
   I do limit myself somewhat. At home I love to listen to the very
raw early blues that have been rescued from ancient 78s, but I
don't want to risk turning my listeners off by pushing music that
is too esoteric.
</P>
<P>
   One of my favorite devices is the birthday tribute. I've got two
scheduled for June, honoring Skip James and Big Bill Broonzy. I've
devoted shows to Mississippi John Hurt, Sonny Boy Williamson, Leroy
Carr, Memphis Slim, Champion Jack Dupree and Sippie Wallace, among
others.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Sippie, I also make it a point to play the great
female voices of the blues and have produced several special
tributes to their work. Bessie Smith, Big Maybelle, Memphis Minnie,
Dinah Washington and Koko Taylor (still going strong) are all
repeat visitors to the show.
</P>
<P>
   My commentary is bilingual, and I always try to tell something
about the lives of artists whose music I play. I also explain
rudiments of blues history, working under the assumption that many
Turks like this music but don't know much about it.
</P>
<P>
   People sometimes tell me they love the music they hear on my
show and then ask, ``So what is blues anyway?'' To help orient
them, I often talk about the Southern roots of this music and how
it moved northward and went electric. Most of my listeners probably
don't know what Parchman Farm or Jim Crow means, or why so many
blues songs talk about leavin' home and ramblin' _ or how many
early blues singers had their roots in the Baptist Church. I try to
provide a little context for an audience that I think is eager to
learn.
</P>
<P>
   Another of my devices is to translate verses, so listeners who
don't understand English can share the many messages of the blues.
With help from my bilingual friend Deniz Aral, I've become probably
the first person to provide Turkish lines like ``Ben bir saatlik
bir kadinim, ve bir dakikalik bir adam benim icin iyi degil.''
Which is a rough translation of that great verse by Ida Cox: ``I'm
a one-hour mama, and no one-minute papa ain't the kind of man for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Turks and blues might seem an odd combination, but it ain't
necessarily so. The country's biggest brewery sponsors an annual
blues festival, and artists ranging from Son Seals to Lucky
Peterson draw big crowds. And of course the legendary
Turkish-American producer Ahmet Ertegun, longtime boss of Atlantic
Records, has played a great role in promoting blues around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   My own show could not exist without the emergence in 1995 of a
wonderful station in Istanbul called Acik Radyo, or Open Radio. It
was founded by a group of '60s veterans who wanted to help broaden
the cultural and political programming available to Turks.
</P>
<P>
   The station manager, Omer Madra, has made a great contribution
to his country by providing a forum for all kinds of music, ranging
from baroque to reggae. His own morning show mixes rock classics
with insightful and unorthodox commentary on national and world
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   My compensation, like that of all the announcers at Acik Radyo,
is limited to the fun of playing great music for a highly
appreciative audience. Some listeners tell me they get a kick out
of my mangled Turkish, but most just say they love the music.
</P>
<P>
   My sainted mother came to Istanbul for a visit recently, and
upon finding herself lost one day she stopped for directions at the
local Chamber of Commerce. She got to talking with the lady who
runs the place and told her: ``Maybe you've heard of my son,
Stephen Kinzer. He covers Turkey for The New York Times.''
</P>
<P>
   A flicker of recognition ran across the lady's face, and she
replied: ``Stephen Kinzer? Doesn't he have a blues show on the
radio?''

AMERICANS, MEXICANS BLAMES EACH OTHER FOR ILLEGAL DRUGS 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Americans and Mexicans blame each other for illegal
drug trafficking and believe the other has benefited more from free
trade in North America, according to a survey of national attitudes
released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The study, conducted by the polling company Louis Harris &AMP;
Associates Inc., also revealed that an overwhelming majority of
Mexicans believe the U.S. government is unfair to Mexicans who
illegally enter and reside in the United States. A small majority
believes the U.S. government mistreats Mexicans who legally live
north of the border.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Harris poll showed Mexican displeasure with
President Clinton, despite his controversial rescue of Mexico's
economy four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Harris conducted the survey of both countries between
April 8 and May 3 to gauge each nation's sentiment toward the other
and to measure Mexicans' views of the likely candidates in their
presidential election next year. Company chairman Humphrey Taylor
said American and Mexican attitudes mirror a global trend in which
citizens of one nation will say that another has caused all the
ills while reaping all the benefits of the international
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   On the subject of drugs, 50 percent of the 4,500 Mexicans
surveyed said Americans' appetite for buying and using drugs is the
main culprit for the illegal trade. By contrast, of the 1,006
Americans surveyed, 48 percent blame Mexico for failing to take
strong action against Mexican drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
   As for imports and exports, a majority of Mexicans, 73 percent,
believe the North American Free Trade Agreement has been good for
the United States, while 47 percent say the accord has been bad for
Mexico. North of the border, 57 percent of Americans report that
the pact has paid dividends for Mexico, and only 39 percent say it
has been beneficial for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The independent survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 3
percent, Louis Harris reported.
</P>
<P>
   With regard to immigration, 82 percent of Mexicans believe the
U.S. government treats Mexicans sneaking across the border
unfairly. In addition, 84 percent of Mexicans say the U.S.
government mistreats Mexicans living illegally in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of Mexicans, 53 percent, also believe the U.S.
government treats unfairly their countrymen who legally reside in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this perceived unfairness results from the sense of
``community'' Mexicans have with family members and friends who
have left Mexico to live in the United States legally, particularly
those residing in the border states of Arizona, California and
Texas, said Vicente Licona, director general of Indemerc Louis
Harris, the pollster's Mexico affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The border does not exist for them,'' Licona said.
</P>
<P>
   Humphrey, though understanding the difference of opinion between
Americans and Mexicans on drugs and NAFTA, said he was
``surprised'' with survey results showing that 67 percent of
Mexicans believe Clinton is not ``a friend of Mexico.'' The company
chairman added that he had no explanation for the displeasure with
Clinton, especially in light of the U.S. president's
multibillion-dollar loan to Mexico in 1995 despite intense
opposition from many Americans.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Mexican election next year, the survey showed
Guanajuato Gov. Vicente Fox leading expected candidates Roberto
Madrazo, governor of Tabasco, and Mexico City Mayor Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas. But Humphrey cautioned that the Harris poll should not be
regarded as a forecast of who will succeed President Ernesto
Zedillo but as a barometer of how the candidates stand now.

multibillion-dollar loan to Mexico in 1995 despite intense
opposition from many Americans.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Mexican election next year, the survey showed
Guanajuato Gov. Vicente Fox leading expected candidates Roberto
Madrazo, governor of Tabasco, and Mexico City Mayor Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas. But Humphrey cautioned that the Harris poll should not be
regarded as a forecast of who will succeed President Ernesto
Zedillo but as a barometer of how the candidates stand now.

 &HT;    BATTLE LOOMS OVER ENCRYPTION POLICY
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories

<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Deep tensions between the Clinton administration
and Congress over software encryption policy surfaced at a House
hearing Tuesday, setting the stage for a possible presidential veto
of pending legislation that would lift all software export
controls.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses from the Justice and Commerce departments and the
top-secret National Security Agency told a House subcommittee that
current blockage of software with strong encryption features should
remain in place to deter foreign crooks, drug lords, terrorists and
spies.
</P>
<P>
   But a parade of Republicans and Democrats on the House
International Economic Policy and Trade Subcommittee joined in
calling the administration, as Rep. Richard Burr, R-N.C., put it,
``an ostrich with its head in the lake.''
</P>
<P>
   Encryption is privacy enhancing technology than encodes computer
files and communications much like a combination lock secures a
filing cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   In assailing the administration's stance, Burr and his
colleagues raised the issue of individual privacy and the need to
spur Internet commerce. They stressed that domestic software firms
are falling behind in building strong encryption technology, for
lack of markets, even as American computer systems become
increasingly vulnerable to foreign penetration.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a ludicrous consequence of current policy, Amazon.com must
buy foreign encryption software to sell its wares'' abroad, Rep.
Bob Goodlatte, R. Va., said. He claimed the policy had caused ``a
significant erosion of U.S. dominance of the U.S. software
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Legislation to reverse the policy, co-sponsored by Goodlatte and
Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., has already attracted 255 supporters in
the 435-member House, including 110 Democrats. Their bill would
offer export relief to such software makers as Microsoft while
barring compulsory ``back doors'' in encryption products, including
those sold for use by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Similar legislation would have likely passed in 1998 if not for
the implacable opposition of a lone, key figure, Rep. Benjamin
Gilman, R-N.Y., who chairs the full International Relations
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Gilman, who attended the subcommittee session, voiced concern
the pending bill ``would make strong encryption all the more
available to our adversaries and would only undermine international
efforts to modernize and improve multilateral export controls.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilman scheduled a closed-door intelligence briefing on the
issue for all House members for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who want to use rich encryption to do something illicit
ultimately have the wherewithal to do it now,'' noted Rep. Robert
Menendez of New Jersey, the ranking Democrat on the panel. ``I get
the sense we're trying to stop something that cannot be stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, William Reinsch, Commerce undersecretary for export
administration, said: ``The issue for us is getting into a world
where everybody is using (unbreakable) encryption. Will it be a
world in which wiretaps will be useless?''
</P>
<P>
   While Reinsch conceded that foreigners could readily, if
illegally, buy powerful U.S. encryption software or, legally, buy
similar products designed abroad, he nevertheless argued for
keeping the controls in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never underestimate the stupidity of some of the people we
have to deal with,'' Reinsch said. ``...Just because we can't
succeed completely doesn't mean we should give up,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because somebody speeds through a school zone doesn't
mean you raise the speed limit,'' echoed Barbara McNamara, deputy
director of the National Security Agency.

INTERNET FUELS REVIVAL OF CENTRALIZED `BIG IRON' COMPUTING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Calif.)  (mk) 
 By STEVE LOHR with JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCHAUMBURG, Ill. _ As Walt Grom tours his domain _ row upon row
of hulking black computers _ he speaks of the importance of
``fundamental engineering disciplines'' and ``brute force
experience.'' The vast room is spotless, brightly lit and chilled
by air conditioning, an austere interior designed for the care and
feeding of big computers.
</P>
<P>
   The huge datacenter, run by IBM, is one of the engine rooms of
the Internet, powering the World Wide Web sites and electronic
commerce operations of some 400 companies and organizations
including BankAmerica, Macy's, Goodyear and the National Hockey
League.
</P>
<P>
   Such computer centers, known as server farms, are the
unglamorous side of the Internet revolution _ a world apart from
the young, urban culture of Web design artists with their tattoos
and earrings. Here, a no-nonsense style prevails, and the hallways
tend to be populated by big, beefy men with beepers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy to do the plumbing,'' said Grom, who runs IBM's
server farm in Schaumburg.
</P>
<P>
   Internet datacenters are sprouting up across the country in a
sure sign of the trend toward once again housing information and
computer power centrally _ a seeming reversal of the last two
decades of computing.
</P>
<P>
   The personal computer has defined the industry's recent history
and how computers were used. As personal computers spread rapidly
in the early 1980s, they were seen as engines of individual
empowerment and decentralization of information. Millions of
islands of information were suddenly stored on desktop machines _
knowledge residing in the spreadsheet, word processing and database
programs of individuals. It was a technical and social repudiation
of the previous three decades, dominated by mainframes and
minicomputers, a computing formula based on ``big iron'' machines
that held all the information.
</P>
<P>
   But in an odd alliance, the Internet _ hailed as the technology
behind a new economics, tearing down old hierarchies and flattening
corporate organizations _is fueling a recentralization of
information and a revival of big iron computing.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet holds the promise of anytime, anywhere access to
information and entertainment delivered over powerful networks to
an array of information appliances like handheld devices, cell
phones with screens and television set-top boxes, not just personal
computers.
</P>
<P>
   That makes the present round of information centralization very
different from the old days. The glass-house datacenters of the
1960s were controlling gatekeepers, with information rationed from
the center. Today's modern server farms, by contrast, are powerful
nodes on the Internet, making information more readily available to
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   There are, to be sure, privacy concerns raised by the prospect
of creating increasingly large digital storehouses of personal
information. Those concerns, technology experts say, require
clear-cut corporate and public policies to protect privacy as
collecting, storing and distributing information becomes easier and
cheaper in a digital economy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even personal computer pioneers generally regard the
shift to Internet-based computing as an irreversible step toward
efficiency rather than a retreat from the information democracy
they sought to foster.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to own their own information but they don't want
to maintain it, and that is driving the shift toward
centralization,'' said Adele Goldberg, a member of the team at
Xerox Palo Alto Research Center in the early 1970s that created the
founding concepts of personal computing.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the Internet, companies are starting to embrace
centralized computing again for the first time in decades. ``A real
mind shift is under way in corporate America,'' Scott Winkler, an
analyst at Gartner Group, a research firm, said.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, corporate America is following the Internet
leaders. For behind an America Online or an Amazon.com is a massive
arsenal of computing power. America Online Inc. supports its
service to more than 16 million subscribers _ with a million people
using the system simultaneously on many evenings _ with two vast
server farms in Virginia and a third one planned, a $520-million
project announced in March. (Such datacenters are known as server
farms because they are veritable crop-rows of big computers that
send, or serve, data out to users.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The good old economics of scale really do apply when it comes
to server farms,'' Marc Andreessen, the chief technology officer of
America Online, said.
</P>
<P>
   The new model of computing _ a proliferation of information
appliances linked by the Internet to server farms _ has been called
the ``post-PC era.'' For the post-PC vision to be fully realized
will take years, and billions of dollars of investment to build
ultra-fast digital networks, wireless technology and new kinds of
handheld and other devices.
</P>
<P>
   And to say that computing appears to be heading toward a post-PC
era is not to say the PC will become obsolete anytime soon. Indeed,
the PC industry has benefited from the rise of the Internet so far
because the PC today is the principal access device to the Net.
Desktop alternatives to the PC like the ``network computer,'' or
NC, running only a Web browser for tapping into the Internet _
first proposed in 1996 by Lawrence Ellison, chairman of Oracle
Corp. _ have not yet slowed PC sales.
</P>
<P>
   But the evolution toward the Internet model, most analysts
agree, represents the most significant change in the industry since
the PC replaced the mainframe as the center of gravity in computing
two decades ago. The shift represents a daunting challenge to the
big winners of the PC industry, Microsoft Corp. and Intel Corp.,
whose software and microchips are the essential technology in most
PCs. Their high profit margins are expected to erode as consumers
increasingly use simpler, lower-cost devices to tap into the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies recognize the challenge and are responding. As
one step, Intel announced in April that it was planning a big move
into Internet services by building and running server farms. The
move seems a big departure for Intel, whose microprocessors serve
as the electronic brains of most PCs. But Intel sees the server
farms as part of its future of moving beyond the personal computer
to become a ``building-block supplier'' to the Internet economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PC industry is changing drastically,'' said Andrew Grove,
the chairman of Intel, ``and when it's over it probably won't even
be called the PC industry. It will become the Web infrastructure
industry.''

 SCHAUMBURG: infrastructure industry.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft is preparing for the day when people may keep much of
their personal and professional information on large servers with
an initiative called Megaserver. The concept is that a person will
be able tap into a large central database via the Web to get
e-mail, personal schedules, news, weather updates and other
information anywhere, anytime.
</P>
<P>
   Even Microsoft concedes the access device will not always be a
PC. ``While the PC will stay central, we realize there is demand
for computing on non-PC devices,'' said Steven Ballmer, the
Microsoft president.
</P>
<P>
   An early test bed for the Megaserver concept is Hotmail, a
Web-based e-mail system, which Microsoft bought for an estimated
$300 million in January 1998. Since then, the number of users of
the free e-mail service has jumped from less than 10 million to 40
million. With Hotmail, a person can retrieve e-mail from anywhere
with any PC or other device equipped with a Web browser instead of
being required to use a particular machine loaded with one's own
e-mail software.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hotmail has served as a big wake-up call for us, and we're
delighted that we bought it,'' John Ludwig, a vice president of
Microsoft, said.
</P>
<P>
   Hotmail is supported by four large datacenters, and Microsoft is
using them as incubators for developing the heavy-duty software
needed to run server farms, thus improving the capabilities of
Windows NT, the company's most powerful operating system. But
Microsoft, Ludwig notes, is also working to improve the software
the user sees, making it easier to use.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more software to write than ever before _ that's the
good news for us,'' he observed.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft added another centralized information service in April
when it acquired Jump Networks Inc., a Web-based calendar and
datebook system.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's move came a few weeks after America Online purchased
an Internet calendar service, When Inc., for an estimated $150
million. The start-up, which stores personal scheduling information
on a Web site, started its fast-growing service just four months
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies are headed in the same direction, though from
different starting points, one a software giant, the other an
online service. Clearly, the line between software and services
will increasingly blur as the shift to Internet-based computing
proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   In an internal memo last fall titled ``The Era Ahead,'' Bill
Gates, the Microsoft chairman, pointed to the opportunity as
software becomes more a services business. ``We get a closer
relationship with customers and a predictable revenue model because
they pay us a regular fee for the service,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But Gates also warned of the rising threat to some Microsoft
products likely to come from online services. ``A company such as
America Online is in competition for all our information-management
software, because they can do it through their servers,'' he
observed.
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley, dozens of start-ups have been created as
Internet services to centrally handle personal information. The new
companies mostly focus on e-mail, calendars and back-up file
storage to insure information is not lost when an individual's PC
crashes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these applications should be moved onto the Internet
because it is more reliable, available everywhere and cheaper,''
said Eric Brewer, a University of California at Berkeley computer
scientist who is a co-founder of Inktomi Corp., a Web software
company.
</P>
<P>
   Building and running the computing engine rooms behind these
Internet services promises to be a good business for years to come.
Yet this behind-the-scenes technology business _ like the market
for Internet appliances _ will most likely be more diverse and
competitive than the bygone mainframe era, whose dominant supplier
was IBM, or the current PC era, ruled by Microsoft and Intel.
</P>
<P>
   The start of the trend back to central computing has already
been rewarding for the established producers of ``big iron''
machines like Sun Microsystems Inc., a leader in computers running
the powerful Unix operating system, and IBM, whose mainframes have
been retooled as Internet servers. The big Unix and mainframe
server computers range in price from $100,000 to millions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big growth for us has been in everything-dot-com _ the
revolution in Internet commerce in all its forms,'' said Edward
Zander, the president of Sun.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as more and more companies begin to view the Internet
not as an experiment but as a technology on which they run their
businesses, they need Web sites, e-mail networks and Internet
order-processing systems to be up and running around the clock,
seven days a week. That kind of reliable, industrial-strength
computing is the traditional bailiwick of mainframes and Unix
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Still, PC technology is improving steadily and PC servers _
typically using Intel microprocessors and Microsoft's Windows NT
software _ are increasingly tackling heavy-duty computing chores.
Some heavily trafficked Web sites, handling huge amounts of
business, are backed up by server farms using mostly PC technology.
</P>
<P>
   Dell Computer Corp., a direct marketer of PCs, says that sales
from its Web site are now running at a pace of $5 billion a year.
``Look at our Web site,'' Michael Dell, the company chairman, said.
``It's Dell servers running Windows NT. Yes, we have a way to go at
the high end of computing, but don't bet against the PC industry.''

 SCHAUMBURG: PC industry.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gary Hargreaves does not much care about who supplies the
technology. He just wants it to work.
</P>
<P>
   Hargreaves manages an electronic commerce project at Goodyear
Tire and Rubber Co. _ a company Web site set up to more efficiently
distribute and share information with its tire dealers.
</P>
<P>
   The current system, which is gradually being phased out, is
costly by any measure _ time, paper or aggravation. Three thick
packets of documents are mailed out each week to Goodyear's 2,400
dealers in the United States and Canada. The company's call center
in Akron, Ohio, receives 2,500 inquiries a day from the dealers,
many of which are merely to obtain routine information on prices
and the availability of tires.
</P>
<P>
   All of that kind of information _ along with sales reporting _
is being transferred to the Web site. A third of Goodyear's North
American dealers are online and using the Web site, though the rest
are joining soon, and Hargreaves is already impressed by the
results. The call center is reporting fewer routine calls, he says,
and dealers say they are getting more timely information, which
helps them sell more tires and improve customer service. The weekly
mailings will be stopped at the start of next year.
</P>
<P>
   For all the attention understandably focused on the meteoric
rise of online retailers and auctioneers, like Amazon and Ebay, the
biggest economic impact of the Internet in the next few years is
expected to be inside old-line companies like Goodyear _ boosting
productivity by electronically automating back-office transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Though Goodyear has an in-house datacenter, it chose to let
outside experts provide the computing power for its Web site _ a
role known as hosting _ and run its electronic commerce network.
Many companies are making the same choice. That is why the Web
hosting business of both established companies like IBM and AT&AMP;T,
and newcomers like Exodus Communications Inc. and Verio Inc., is
projected to grow from $696 million last year to $10.7 billion in
2002, according to International Data Corp., a research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Internet companies like America Online, to be sure, will have
their own server farms. But others increasingly view computing as a
utility, a service to be purchased like electricity. Indeed,
technology historians note that when factories began using
electricity in the late 19th century, each had its own power plant.
Later, regional utilities were created and sold electric service to
the factories.
</P>
<P>
   At Goodyear, Hargreaves seemed to apply the same logic to his
company's decision to have its Web site for dealers managed by IBM
at its server farm in Schaumburg. ``We're in the tire business,''
he explained. ``Why run the digital power plant ourselves?''

<P>
   LONDON AND WASHINGTON _ As Israel was adjusting Tuesday to Ehud
Barak's sweeping electoral triumph over Benjamin Netanyahu, it
emerged that close aides to Tony Blair and Bill Clinton had been
working closely with Barak's Labor Party and transforming it in the
way Blair modernized Britain's New Labor.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Gould, the British Prime Minister's opinion polling guru,
and Stan Greenberg, who does the same job for President Clinton,
have held monthly strategy meetings in Israel for the past two
years with Barak, the newly-elected Israeli prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Confidential documents seen by The Independent reveal the extent
of their work in helping the Israeli Labor Party back to power.
</P>
<P>
   Barak even came to London for a two-day brainstorming session on
how to remodel his image.
</P>
<P>
   The White House Tuesday hailed the election of Barak with
restrained delight but was closer to the election campaign than its
public neutrality suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Greenberg, advising Barak in his planning strategy,
conducting polls and framing advertising, were two other members of
the election team credited with helping Clinton to his first
presidential victory in 1992: James Carville and Robert Shrum.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of a new advance in the Middle East is
especially welcome in Washington, where Clinton is in sore need of
a foreign policy success following the diplomatic setbacks in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of his military service, the question of General
Barak's devotion to the security of Israel is not in question,''
Clinton told reporters Tuesday after a meeting with King Abdullah
of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   The direct involvement of Blair and Clinton aides followed an
appeal for help by Daniel Levy, the Tel Aviv-based son of Lord
(Michael) Levy, a close friend and the tennis partner of Blair.
</P>
<P>
   Gould and Greenberg were the architects of the proposal that the
party change its name, even suggesting at one point that it be
called New Labor.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the Labor party kept its name but fought the
election under the One Israel banner, the name of the alliance it
formed with two smaller parties.
</P>
<P>
   How far the new model Labor party made more than a cosmetic
difference to the outcome of the election is doubted by some
Israeli analysts. Barak won, they believe, because so many of the
former prime minister's senior colleagues had been fired or
deserted and set up the Center Party to remove him.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign strategy amounted to keeping his mouth shut and
watching his opponent who presided over a rickety coalition,
self-destruct.
</P>
<P>
   But when they became involved in 1997, Gould and Greenberg
warned that the modernization of Labor was the most important and
difficult task facing the Barak campaign. They recommended the
``dramatic high risk'' strategy pursued by Blair.
</P>
<P>
   Their initial assessment of Labor's prospects was poor. Labor's
combination of ``elitism plus softness on the core security
issues'' was summed up as ``fatal.''
</P>
<P>
   A center-left party must do two things, they advised: ``It must
be the party of the people. This means the party of the new middle
class; the new majority; hard-working; tough-minded. It must win
the center: on security; on crime; on welfare it has to be tough,
not soft.''
</P>
<P>
   Gould and Greenberg warned that Labor was not considered to be
``the party of the people''; the party that could best resolve
social problems or unite the country. Neither was it the ``party of
security or religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Gould and Greenberg described Barak's strengths as ``a powerful
and imposing presence; a manifest sense of destiny; the genesis of
a talented team and the innate weakness of Netanyahu, a poor prime
minister tainted by corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   Last night Gould said most of the credit should go to Greenberg,
a partner in his London-based political consultancy. ``Stan did an
extraordinary job. He kept faith during a difficult project and got
an incredible result,'' said Gould.
</P>
<P>
   Carville meanwhile _ who was one of Clinton's most bullish
defenders during the Monica Lewinsky affair _ has said in the past
that he accepted the job with Barak in his capacity as a private
consultant and had not asked the White House for approval.
</P>
<P>
   However, he made no secret of the fact that he regularly briefed
Clinton on the progress of the campaign _ briefings that will
doubtless smooth the path of U.S.-Israeli cooperation now.
</P>
<P>
   Among American Jews _ several thousand of whom had taken charter
flights to Israel to cast their vote _ reactions to Barak's victory
reflected the polarization of opinion over Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Given the size of his victory, however, the majority were
expected to rally around Barak, reinforcing calls for peace and
increasing the pressure to establish a durable peace. &QL;

 By ANNE MCELVOY  
 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ British Prime Minister Tony Blair started this war as
the European leader who combined impeccably pro-European
credentials with a stiffening twist of Atlanticism.
</P>
<P>
   To Americans, he appeared as the perfected version of the flawed
Clinton model: an invigorating, center-left politician who didn't
need to lie about his sex life.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, he was the example of revitalized centrism on whom
Gerhard Schroder modelled himself in his bid for the
chancellorship.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's ideas and style were a universally sought-after British
export.
</P>
<P>
   How different things look today in the pre-terminal phase of the
conflict in Kosovo. The Prime Minister is finding himself stuck in
the position that comes least naturally to one of nature's
bridge-builders _ out on a limb.
</P>
<P>
   Germany is panting for an exit strategy from the conflict, at
practically any price. The Chancellor who said a month ago that
Germans should not rule out ground troops because to do so was to
neglect the country's special responsibility for peace in the
Balkans, is now flatly declaring the option ``unthinkable.''
</P>
<P>
   The French political establishment and opinion polls remain
hawkish, but the military, observing the raison d'etat that led it
into semi-estrangement from NATO four decades ago, is enthusiastic
only about being part of a ground force in which they, rather than
the Americans, provide the lead, take the glory and establish
themselves as the diplomatic force majeure in the region.
</P>
<P>
   As his European support flakes away, Blair has resorted to
pursuing a zigzag policy with the Americans in the hope that he can
needle or wheedle them into some kind of action consistent with
NATO's rhetorical stand against the Serbs' oppression of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few days he has alternated praise with criticism in
the hope that this will have some effect on the policymakers in the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Having allowed dissatisfaction with American hemming and hawing
on ground troops to leak out at the weekend, Blair has changed tack
on his visit to Albania and lauded the ``vision and steadfastness''
of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Prime Minister has recruited the weapon of heavy
irony to his rhetorical arsenal. Vision and steadfastness are the
two qualities most strikingly absent from American policy towards
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In what may prove to be a final throw for ground intervention,
British Foreign Minister Robin Cook will venture to Washington
armed with the British assessment of the Yugoslav National Army's
fighting strength, which shows the Serbs to be far weaker than the
Pentagon's analysis suggests and the environment as ``permissive''
for NATO troops as it could be without Milosevic issuing a
gilt-edged invitation.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning of their association, before Blair's
election, Clinton and Blair sought to appear as a political item.
</P>
<P>
   The Third Way was their love child _ a concept at once so
perfectly inclusive, economically neutral and innocently vacuous
that to oppose it seemed to be an act of bloody-mindedness.
</P>
<P>
   My complaint against the Third Way is that it fudged the
inevitability of making stark choices. War is the starkest choice
of all. Blair realizes that. Clinton does not. As a result, we have
a disquieting loss of resolve at the heart of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The special relationship between Britain and America will not
survive a shabby end to the intervention in Kosovo. Neither, in its
present form, will NATO. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (350-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 550) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In tragic circumstances, Blair has been confronted by the
shortcomings of his political blood brother. New Labor has long had
a blind spot about Clinton's moral vacuum. They considered Monica
Lewinsky and the rest to be the minor lapses of a president who was
otherwise in great ethical shape.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, they betokened a deeper weakness _ his talent for
vacillation and relativism, which has returned to haunt us all in
the conflict with Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Blair, Clinton cannot see a line without fudging it. He
wanted a war without risk, intervention without setting American
foot in the war zone, compassion without cost.

   America aimed to win the war by fluke. When this hope foundered
as Milosevic defied the bombs, Clinton ditched his original goal

<P>
   Liberation by the Russians has always been a mixed blessing, as
those who experienced it in eastern Germany and Poland at the end
of the Second World War still recall.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovars will not return to a part of their territory under
Russian protection. That means partitioning, or, as the Russians
now put it, with nostalgia for their post-1945 role in Germany,
``sectorization.'' There is even talk of a force without a U.S.
component, a triumph for Milosevic. &QL;

GOVERNMENT UNION SAYS SOCIAL SECURITY PLAN WOULD COST $25 BILLION

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's largest union of public employees
warned Tuesday that any effort to move government workers into the
Social Security system would cost them and their employers $25
billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
   The result, leaders of the 1.3 million-member American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Union said,
would be reduced public services and possibly higher taxes as
governments scrambled to make up the shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Requiring all public employees to participate in Social
Security would be a huge and costly mistake,'' said Edwin Jayne,
AFSCME associate director of legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The original Social Security Act of 1935 excluded government
workers from the pay-as-you-go Social Security retirement benefit
system. Over time, however, Congress extended such benefits to
public employees not already covered by their state and local
employers' pension plans.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security Administration estimates that 5 million
workers now are in such pension plans funded by their government
employers and neither pay into nor receive Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Several congressional plans to overhaul Social Security have
advocated incorporating newly hired public employees workers into
Social Security as a way of boosting the system's flagging trust
fund. Under current estimates, the fund will be unable to pay full
benefits starting in 2034.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference here, AFSCME officials unveiled a study
showing how adding the newly hired workers to Social Security would
cost the $25 billion over five years. That figure, said Cathie
Eitelberg, the consultant who authored the study, was derived by
assuming a 9 percent yearly turnover and a 3 percent rise in
payroll each year.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers yielded were recalculated along with the cost to
governments and their workers of paying the 12.4 percent Social
Security payroll tax, which Eitelberg said produced the $25 billion
figure. Adding public employees would extend the life of the Social
Security trust fund by only two years, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jayne and Thomas Lussier, chairman of the Coalition to Preserve
Social Security, an employer-union group formed to fight Social
Security enrollment for government workers, said state and local
governments would have little choice but to reduce services or
raise taxes.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, inclusion of government workers was part of several
congressional plans to fix Social Security. But support for the
idea has dwindled after a concerted lobbying effort by AFSCME and
the coalition. ``We've been successful in demonstrating the pain is
not worth the gain,'' Lussier said.
</P>
<P>
   But Lussier insisted that in future congressional deliberations
over how best to prop up Social Security, lawmakers might revive
the idea.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Social Security and the existing government-run counterparts
have different structures, Eitelberg explained. Under the
pay-as-you-go Social Security system, payroll taxes of those
working today go to pay the benefits of current retirees. Social
Security is envisioned as part of an individual's retirement
income, to be combined with an employment-based pension plan and
personal savings.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Eitelberg said, state and local government
retirement plans are pre-funded, meaning that workers pay into them
and draw on them as an all-inclusive pension. They are structured
to take care of public employees such as firemen and policemen who
often retire at 55 as the physical demands of their jobs become too
great for them.
</P>
<P>
   Reliance on Social Security, which permits early retirement at
62, would not take care of public employees' retirement income
needs, Eitelberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The study included a chart showing potential impact to
government workers in each state.
</P>
<P>
   For California, with 903,000 public employees not covered by
Social Security, the cost over five years would be $4.1 billion.
For New York, with 90,680 such workers, the cost would be $704
million. For Michigan, with 85,808 workers, the cost would be
$632.4 million. For Texas, with 515,751 such workers, the cost
would be $2.6 billion. For Washington state, with 46,868 workers,
the cost would be $363.8 million.

 &HT;    Judges debate suit claiming rich candidates have edge
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A panel of federal judges expressed concern Tuesday
over the merits of a novel legal challenge that claims Georgia's
election laws illegally favor wealthy candidates in state political
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, John White, a former state representative from
Albany, filed suit in federal court in Atlanta to force public
campaign financing in state elections.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was dismissed by U.S. District Judge Willis Hunt; on
Tuesday, a three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals heard arguments on the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The case filed by White, who is now a private consultant,
involves his 1996 campaign for the state Senate against Mark
Taylor, who is now lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   Using $90,000 of his own money to finance his campaign, Taylor
outspent White $270,000 to $16,000 and outpolled him as well,
getting 58 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   White's lawsuit against the Secretary of State's office, joined
by the Georgia State Conference of NAACP Branches, claims Georgia's
electoral system creates a ``wealth primary'' that violates equal
protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without access to wealth, one simply cannot stand a chance to
win an election in Georgia,'' White's attorney, Gregory Luke, told
the three-judge panel. ``The process is not meaningfully open. You
might as well use a jousting match to determine who wins elections
in Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   But Judge Alan Gold, noting that a federal appeals court in San
Francisco already has rejected a similar type of lawsuit,
questioned how the court could order the General Assembly to enact
laws that require public financing of elections. ``Isn't that
really a violation of the separation of powers?'' Gold asked.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Rosemary Barkett also challenged Luke's assertion that
prior rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court gives the appeals court
authority to rule in White's favor. ``Isn't that a stretch?''
Barkett asked.
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn Allen, a lawyer with the state Attorney General's
Office, admitted that the wealth of a candidate can play a role in
the outcome of an election. But so can the ethnic makeup of a
voting district, a candidate's gender and name recognition, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   As for White's attempts to force solutions to the problems
facing non-wealthy political candidates, ``maybe it's the right
thing to do,'' Allen said. ``It's a societal problem. But this is
for the Legislature,'' not the courts, to address, she told the
panel.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ British Prime Minister Tony Blair started this war as
the European leader who combined impeccably pro-European
credentials with a stiffening twist of Atlanticism.
</P>
<P>
   To Americans, he appeared as the perfected version of the flawed
Clinton model: an invigorating, center-left politician who didn't
need to lie about his sex life.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, he was the example of revitalized centrism on whom
Gerhard Schroder modelled himself in his bid for the
chancellorship.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's ideas and style were a universally sought-after British
export.
</P>
<P>
   How different things look today in the pre-terminal phase of the
conflict in Kosovo. The Prime Minister is finding himself stuck in
the position that comes least naturally to one of nature's
bridge-builders _ out on a limb.
</P>
<P>
   Germany is panting for an exit strategy from the conflict, at
practically any price. The Chancellor who said a month ago that
Germans should not rule out ground troops because to do so was to
neglect the country's special responsibility for peace in the
Balkans, is now flatly declaring the option ``unthinkable.''
</P>
<P>
   The French political establishment and opinion polls remain
hawkish, but the military, observing the raison d'etat that led it
into semi-estrangement from NATO four decades ago, is enthusiastic
only about being part of a ground force in which they, rather than
the Americans, provide the lead, take the glory and establish
themselves as the diplomatic force majeure in the region.
</P>
<P>
   As his European support flakes away, Blair has resorted to
pursuing a zigzag policy with the Americans in the hope that he can
needle or wheedle them into some kind of action consistent with
NATO's rhetorical stand against the Serbs' oppression of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few days he has alternated praise with criticism in
the hope that this will have some effect on the policymakers in the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Having allowed dissatisfaction with American hemming and hawing
on ground troops to leak out at the weekend, Blair has changed tack
on his visit to Albania and lauded the ``vision and steadfastness''
of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Prime Minister has recruited the weapon of heavy
irony to his rhetorical arsenal. Vision and steadfastness are the
two qualities most strikingly absent from American policy towards
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In what may prove to be a final throw for ground intervention,
British Foreign Minister Robin Cook will venture to Washington
armed with the British assessment of the Yugoslav National Army's
fighting strength, which shows the Serbs to be far weaker than the
Pentagon's analysis suggests and the environment as ``permissive''
for NATO troops as it could be without Milosevic issuing a
gilt-edged invitation.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning of their association, before Blair's
election, Clinton and Blair sought to appear as a political item.
</P>
<P>
   The Third Way was their love child _ a concept at once so
perfectly inclusive, economically neutral and innocently vacuous
that to oppose it seemed to be an act of bloody-mindedness.
</P>
<P>
   My complaint against the Third Way is that it fudged the
inevitability of making stark choices. War is the starkest choice
of all. Blair realizes that. Clinton does not. As a result, we have
a disquieting loss of resolve at the heart of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The special relationship between Britain and America will not
survive a shabby end to the intervention in Kosovo. Neither, in its
present form, will NATO. &QL;

<P>
   &UR; (350-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 550) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In tragic circumstances, Blair has been confronted by the
shortcomings of his political blood brother. New Labor has long had
a blind spot about Clinton's moral vacuum. They considered Monica
Lewinsky and the rest to be the minor lapses of a president who was
otherwise in great ethical shape.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, they betokened a deeper weakness _ his talent for
vacillation and relativism, which has returned to haunt us all in
the conflict with Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Blair, Clinton cannot see a line without fudging it. He
wanted a war without risk, intervention without setting American
foot in the war zone, compassion without cost.
</P>
<P>
   The more fervent Clinton's verbal commitment to help, the less
American resolve has held. When Hillary Rodham Clinton told the
Kosovar refugees last week that she felt their pain, I knew we

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Like police officers moving spectators away from a
nasty accident, spin-doctors and officials in both Britain and the
U.S. were shooing reporters away from the idea of a transatlantic
split Monday _ ``Nothing to see here; move along.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the ringing endorsements of NATO solidarity Monday from
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Foreign Minister Robin Cook
cannot hide a growing and disturbing fact: Washington and London
risk putting themselves on a collision course over the question of
sending infantry into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The squabble could end up making life all the worse for hundreds
of thousands of refugees still at the mercy of the Serbs inside
Kosovo and being used as human shields as Nato steps up its bombing
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The spat is all the more surprising because of the hitherto very
close ties between Downing Street and the White House, celebrated
in daily telephone calls, policy seminars and familial closeness
between ``Tony'' and ``Bill.'' But no amount of ``Third Way
weekends'' can hide the differences.
</P>
<P>
   Neither London nor Washington wants a full-scale invasion, and
neither wants to end the air war. But some officials in Britain
believe that threatening to push harder on the ground would make it
possible to ease up in the air and reduce the civilian casualties
that are mounting daily.
</P>
<P>
   America does not. Britain wants to accelerate planning. America
does not.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it a row over substance, officials on both sides
underline, but presentation - so far. Yet as a consequence of its
persistence and moral fervor, Britain is in danger of creating a
serious argument.
</P>
<P>
   In the view of some in Washington, Britain has repeatedly tried
to steer the United States towards a more aggressive land strategy
for the war.
</P>
<P>
   America will not allow its forces to be put in Kosovo except as
part of a peacekeeping force, or be railroaded into making
commitments until it is ready.
</P>
<P>
   The disagreement goes back to Blair's evening visit to the White
House before the NATO summit last month, when he and his weary
officials clustered into the Oval Office to put their case after a
transatlantic flight.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton deferred repeatedly to Sandy Berger, his hard-nosed
National Security Adviser, and Berger would not budge.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone is agreed that if and when a deal is signed with
Belgrade, ground forces _ under NATO command, but with a United
Nations cover _ would enter Kosovo and return the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   More troops would be needed than originally thought _ perhaps
50-60,000, with perhaps 10-15,000 of them Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Planning for this force is under way. But Britain is pushing for
early decisions, before there is a deal, and before it is clear
under what conditions a force would enter Kosovo.

<P>
   There is no constituency in Washington for a land war, or even

would no more willingly see their sons die in Kosovo than Britons
would allow theirs to die in Rwanda.

   Americans do not necessarily see Blair's crusade as a heroic

   NATO has started planning for the peacekeeping force in Kosovo,
and commitments will soon be needed from the U.S. for a new and
larger force. Britain wants a substantial U.S. presence, but there
is a strong argument in the U.S. that the force should be largely
European.
</P>
<P>
   There are also discussions on how to handle Kosovo's political
future. There is an emerging view in Washington that Milosevic must
be given some latitude to help him to back down; and there is a
continuing view in the White House that ultimately, only he can do
the deal that will end the war.
</P>
<P>
   Britain has sometimes seemed to lean more in the direction of
removing Milosevic. If the current row is not rapidly smoothed
over, it risks making these differences all the harder to bridge. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Like police officers moving spectators away from a
nasty accident, spin-doctors and officials in both Britain and the
U.S. were shooing reporters away from the idea of a transatlantic
split Monday _ ``Nothing to see here; move along.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the ringing endorsements of NATO solidarity Monday from
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Foreign Minister Robin Cook
cannot hide a growing and disturbing fact: Washington and London
risk putting themselves on a collision course over the question of
sending infantry into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The squabble could end up making life all the worse for hundreds
of thousands of refugees still at the mercy of the Serbs inside
Kosovo and being used as human shields as Nato steps up its bombing
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The spat is all the more surprising because of the hitherto very
close ties between Downing Street and the White House, celebrated
in daily telephone calls, policy seminars and familial closeness
between ``Tony'' and ``Bill.'' But no amount of ``Third Way
weekends'' can hide the differences.
</P>
<P>
   Neither London nor Washington wants a full-scale invasion, and
neither wants to end the air war. But some officials in Britain
believe that threatening to push harder on the ground would make it
possible to ease up in the air and reduce the civilian casualties
that are mounting daily.
</P>
<P>
   America does not. Britain wants to accelerate planning. America
does not.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it a row over substance, officials on both sides
underline, but presentation - so far. Yet as a consequence of its
persistence and moral fervor, Britain is in danger of creating a
serious argument.
</P>
<P>
   In the view of some in Washington, Britain has repeatedly tried
to steer the United States towards a more aggressive land strategy
for the war.
</P>
<P>
   America will not allow its forces to be put in Kosovo except as
part of a peacekeeping force, or be railroaded into making
commitments until it is ready.
</P>
<P>
   The disagreement goes back to Blair's evening visit to the White
House before the NATO summit last month, when he and his weary
officials clustered into the Oval Office to put their case after a
transatlantic flight.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton deferred repeatedly to Sandy Berger, his hard-nosed
National Security Adviser, and Berger would not budge.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone is agreed that if and when a deal is signed with
Belgrade, ground forces _ under NATO command, but with a United
Nations cover _ would enter Kosovo and return the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   More troops would be needed than originally thought _ perhaps
50-60,000, with perhaps 10-15,000 of them Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Planning for this force is under way. But Britain is pushing for
early decisions, before there is a deal, and before it is clear
under what conditions a force would enter Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between Washington and London is one of tone,
strategy and motivation. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In the morning after his euphoric victory rally,
Ehud Barak, the new prime minister of Israel, woke up to the
sobering task of cobbling together a coalition broad enough that he
can pursue peace without facing civil strife.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, the Labor Party leader, faced one immediate strategic
decision: whether to take into his government the ultra-Orthodox
Shas Party of Aryeh Deri, who was recently convicted on corruption
charges, or the defeated, demoralized Likud Party of former Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Both Deri and Netanyahu, tight allies, have stepped down as
their party's leaders _ Netanyahu on Monday night, after his
resounding defeat by Barak, and Deri Tuesday night, after his
party's triumphant success in the elections in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Either large opposition party would help the Labor leader make
territorial concessions more acceptable to the nationalists in
Israeli society. And both became more palatable partners without
their leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, in his victory speech and at the Western Wall Tuesday,
held himself up as a potential healer for the deep divides in
Israeli society.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a conciliator,'' said Daniel Ben-Simon, a writer for the
newspaper Haaretz. ``He hugs everyone. He's a man of so many
kisses.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he can tackle society, though, Barak must navigate the
minefields in a newly realigned parliament of 15 parties. The two
major parties, Likud and Labor, both shrank after an election in
which Barak's party did not achieve the resounding personal victory
that Barak scored over Netanyahu by going outside Israel's
traditional party lines.
</P>
<P>
   Labor and its closest allies have fewer seats in Parliament than
Netanyahu's Likud-led alliance, which had been the weakest
governing coalition in Israeli history. But Likud's alliance was
fractious and uneasy from the start, while the center-left
alliances are more natural and reliable.
</P>
<P>
   Mathematically, at least, Barak does not have to reach out to
his political opponents, Shas or Likud, who will surely want
concessions _ in the peace process, perhaps, or in the
secular-religious divide in Israeli society.
</P>
<P>
   Still, overnight, the political landscape here changed.
</P>
<P>
   The right-wing collapsed. The settlers' party dwindled. The
center, including the Russians, blossomed. The secularists formed a
new, large bloc. Standing opposite them, Shas mushroomed into a
major party, sucking away partisans of the Likud.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night, we were a clerical, right-wing nation,'' said
Chemi Shalev, a political analyst for the Maariv newspaper.
``Today, we are social democrats and the knights of pluralism.''
</P>
<P>
   The political map in Israeli society used to be drawn around
attitudes toward peace. Those who supported territorial concessions
in exchange for peace were considered left, and those who opposed
them were right.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, as a consensus on peace grows, the battlegrounds
have become more varied. Some think the new Parliament divides into
secular and religious camps, the new frontlines in Israeli society.
</P>
<P>
   In that atmosphere, Israel's political analysts buzzed with
speculation Tuesday about what kind of unlikely political matches
would be made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the first call will go to Ariel Sharon,'' the hardline
right-wing Foreign Minister, ``and I would not be surprised if he
will be Israel's next foreign minister, too,'' said Akiva Eldar, a
political columnist for Haaretz.
</P>
<P>
   As unlikely as it may seem to imagine the tough former general
in a center-left government, associates of Barak were wagering on
Sharon's appointment months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's One Israel Party, which includes the Labor Party and the
Gesher Party, which used to be aligned with Likud, won 27 seats in
the new parliament, far short of a 61-seat majority.
</P>
<P>
   Adding the seats of Barak's natural center-left allies, he could
form a majority government with one or more of the small Arab
parties. Because Barak courted and counted on the Arab vote, it is
possible he would bring them into his inner circle. But forming
alliances with Arab parties has been a polarizing decision for past
Labor leaders, and it is one that Barak, intent on unity, might
avoid.
</P>
<P>
   With the Arabs or even with the settlers' party, which has grown
more moderate, Barak could assemble a working coalition. But to
move the peace effort forward, to finalize agreements with the
Palestinians and the Syrians, he needs more than a simple majority.
He needs and wants a broad consensus.
</P>
<P>
   ``To push through a peace agreement with only a slight majority
is an impossibility in Israel,'' said Emanuel Guttman, a political
scientist from Hebrew University.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   It made it easier to contemplate relationships with Likud and
Shas after they lost their troubled leaders in the last two days.
Given that the vote was a resounding repudiation of Netanyahu, few
in Barak's party would have been eager to make a deal with his
Likud.
</P>
<P>
   Already, however, other Likudniks are jockeying to take over as
leader, with Meir Sheetrit, the former coalition whip for
Netanyahu, the first to throw his hat in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Barak's associates rejected the idea of joining hands
with Deri, who awaits sentencing on his bribery conviction. Running
a campaign based on Deri's assertion that he had been persecuted by
the justice system because he is Moroccan-born and religious, Shas
engineered an amazing victory in Monday's elections. It won 17
seats, an increase of 7, making it the third largest party, after
Likud, which fell to 19 with Monday's election losses and the
defection of Gesher to Barak's new party.
</P>
<P>
   Deri took it as a vindication, and stepped down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot continue in a national role,'' he said. ``I will not
serve in parliament.''
</P>
<P>
   With or without Deri, the leftist Meretz party would react
strongly to an alliance with Shas. And many of Barak's
constituents, who grew tired of what they saw as the ultra-Orthodox
stranglehold on Netanyahu's government, would be upset.
</P>
<P>
   Shas, while it supports the peace effort, also believes that the
Jewish homeland should be governed by Jewish law and not by a
secular legal system.
</P>
<P>
   Shas would co-exist uneasily with the Russian immigrant party of
Natan Sharansky. It did in Netanyahu's government. But bitter
tensions between Moroccan and Russian immigrants came to the
surface during the last few months as Yisrael Baaliyah, Sharansky's
party, campaigned to gain hold of the Interior Ministry, long run
by Shas.
</P>
<P>
   Sharanksy's party will undoubtedly join Barak's coalition. It
kept steady at seven seats in the new parliament, while a new
Russian immigrant party, Israel is Our Home, earned four, taking
many voters from Likud.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament is to be sworn in in three weeks, and Barak has 45
days to form a government.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Segev, who writes a column for Haaretz, warns against seeing
a political coalition as a healing agent for society.
</P>
<P>
   ``This or that coalition can change the atmosphere in
politics,'' he said. ``But the struggle over the basic values in
our society does not change that easily.''

Y2K BILL STALLS IN SENATE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A bill aimed at limiting lawsuits from year 2000
computer breakdowns was stalled in the Senate on Tuesday, leaving
consumer groups who oppose it and high-tech companies who favor it
wondering whether the legislation is dead for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors of the bill failed to win enough support in a Senate
vote to continue debate on the measure. The measure is similar to
legislation passed last week by the House that would impose a
90-day waiting period before lawsuits could be filed by consumers
or businesses claiming damages based on so-called Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., finally pulled it
from consideration when Democrats demanded more time to debate
unrelated gun-control amendments to a juvenile justice bill.
</P>
<P>
   An angry Lott, who had hoped to force a vote on the Y2K measure
in the afternoon, later said that the current bill may not be
brought up again.
</P>
<P>
   If the bill dies, he said, it would be ``a devastating blow for
business and industry in this country,'' which could face lawsuits
stemming from problems if computers and other technological
gadgetry fail to register the date correctly when the year 2000
arrives. Unless corrected, computer chip-reliant equipment could
read the date as 1900 because older technology is designed to
recognize only the last two digits of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said he would not attempt to bring the bill up again unless
Democrats demonstrate to him that they ``care about this Y2K
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Action on the Y2K legislation has twice been delayed in the
Senate by Democrats opposed to the measure who want to see it
strengthened to protect consumers. Last month, the bill had to be
put aside when several Democrats tried to attach an increase in the
minimum wage to it.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to move the legislation to a vote, Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., its chief sponsor, has agreed to a number of
amendments that would boost consumer protections and has dropped
some of the limits the bill places on punitive damages that could
be sought in Y2K-related lawsuits. He also has dropped a provision
designed to protect individual company directors and officers from
damages.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, the changes have not been enough to satisfy consumer
groups and trial lawyers who don't want to see any waiting period
or limits on damages enacted. They also complain, as do lawmakers
who oppose the legislation, that it does little to encourage
businesses to fix potential Y2K-related problems.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has also gone on record against the bill, saying
it would limit the rights of consumers and businesses who might
have legitimate claims of damage. The administration has warned in
a letter to Republican leaders that Clinton could end up vetoing
the bill if it passes the Senate because of those concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is backed primarily by California's Silicon
Valley industries and other computer-related companies nationwide
that could be sued if technology they designed fails to work
properly after Dec. 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and other lawmakers who support placing limits on the
lawsuits fear that legal proceedings stemming from problems could
far exceed the $22 billion in claims that have been filed since
Congress passed the Superfund bill 20 years ago that forced
companies to begin cleaning up toxic waste and other dump sites
considered an environmental hazard.
</P>
<P>
   Given the fact that so many businesses _ ranging from health
care providers to small ``mom-and-pop'' companies _ have failed to
take corrective action to avert Y2K problems, the sponsors of the
legislation say that damages from lawsuits could run as high as $1
trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Both the House and Senate versions of the bill would initiate a
so-called 90-day cooling off period before suits can actually be
filed. The delay is designed to give computer companies and
software developers time to fix any problems that have occurred.
The House bill would also impose restrictions on class-action
lawsuits and limit punitive damages to about $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this bill would reward the people who created the
problem and reward the people who don't take any corrective action
to prevent it,'' said Carlton Carl, a spokesman for the American
Association of Trial Lawyers, which is opposed to the Y2K
legislation.

ARABS CELEBRATE BARAK VICTORY BUT EXPECT LITTLE CHANGE IN ISRAELI
POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL    
 c .1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ Arabs loved to hate Benjamin Netanyahu, so his
trouncing in Israel's elections was welcomed by many in the Arab
world Tuesday with a kind of triumphalism _ a sense that the
Israelis had finally seen the light.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Arabs feel a moral victory,'' said Osama al-Ghazali,
editor of International Politics, an Egyptian magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Netanyahu's policies were futile,'' said Esmat Abdel-Maguid,
secretary general of the Arab League.
</P>
<P>
   And a columnist in Al Ahram, Egypt's leading newspaper, wrote,
``Netanyahu has gone to the place of no return, where he belongs.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the gloating, however, are deep uncertainties about just
what Ehud Barak's victory might mean. Amr Moussa, Egypt's foreign
minister, predicted a ``reactivation'' of the quest for a broader
Middle East peace, but others warned against over-optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barak will try to revive peace in all tracks, but no miracles
can be expected,'' said Tahseen Bashir, a former top aide to
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. ``He will create a new spirit of
peace, and Israel will get closer to the Arab world, but nothing
more.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the Arabs may one day miss Netanyahu. His
policies, outrageous to most Arabs, meant that whatever went wrong
in Arab-Israeli relations could usually be portrayed as his fault.
Barak is seen by most Arabs as a friendlier face, but he has
signaled a preference for negotiation over confrontation, and that
might make dealing with him a more formidable job.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese newspaper Al Safir went so far as to to warn that
Israel had become ``more dangerous'' under Barak, more of a
centrist, than it has been under Netanyahu, who was seen as
promoting a divisive brand of extremism. ``The flock is back in
formation,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, Arab scholars and other experts said Barak could
put Syria in an awkward position if he exploits the Israeli
weariness with the two-decade-old occupation of southern Lebanon,
which has claimed hundreds of Israeli lives. Barak has pledged to
withdraw all Israeli troops from southern Lebanon by June of next
year, a move that would be welcomed by most Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Tactically, such a move could carry the added advantage of
causing headaches for Syria, which maintains thousands of soldiers
in Lebanon and has used southern Lebanon as a pressure point
against Israel for years. If Israel were to withdraw, there would
be international pressure on Syria to guarantee security along the
Israeli-Lebanese border.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has also signaled that he intends to resume peace talks
with Syria over the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria
in the 1967 Middle East war. There were no talks between the two
nations during Netanyahu's three-year tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu had insisted that the talks begin anew, a stance that
the Syrians rejected. One approach might be to restart the talks
with Syria where they left off in early 1996, under Shimon Peres,
the last Labor prime minister. By agreeing to a resumption, Barak
would address that complaint, but he would also quickly present
President Hafez Assad of Syria with difficult decisions.
</P>
<P>
   One would be whether to accept the kind of peace offer that
Israel put on the table three years ago _ one that by most accounts
fell just short of Assad's demand for Israel's total withdrawal
from the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   The other decision, perhaps just as hard, would be on whether
Syria could go forward with an agreement on the Golan Heights
before Israel and the Palestinians reach their final accord. To do
so might be tempting, but it would be the same kind of separate
peace that Syria condemned when agreements were reached by Egypt,
Jordan and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrian government is clearly curious about what Barak
intends. ``He must play his peace cards swiftly, if he has any, and
make his intentions clear,'' the official Syria Times said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, the Syrians seem apprehensive. ``The
peace process will remain suspended if Netanyahu wins,'' the
newspaper Tishreen said on Monday, ``and it will also remain
suspended if Barak does not put an end to the Israel intransigence,
especially about complete withdrawal from the Golan Heights, south
Lebanon, the West Bank and Jerusalem.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Across the region Tuesday, Arab newspapers generally adopted an
attitude of skepticism. ``Netanyahu's defeat should not make us
over-optimistic, as Barak has not presented in his speeches and
statements anything different from Netanyahu,'' was one typical
comment, in an editorial in the Qatar newspaper Asharq.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the intensity of ill will felt by many Arabs toward
Netanyahu meant that Tuesday was a day of relief. In the months
before Netanyahu won his upset victory over Peres, the Middle East
had seemed to many people to be on the brink of a broader peace. In
the years since, it has been mired in stalemate and frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to see the tears of defeat in his eyes,'' Ragah
Mohammed, 26, an Egyptian translator, said of Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   And Zahi Hawass, one of Egypt's top archeological officials,
said, ``Last night, I slept deeply for the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Egypt and other Arab countries had no preference
about who should win the election. But the Middle East is a region
badly in need of stability and cooperation, and it was clear that
most Arab officials saw Barak as the candidate more likely to
promote both.
</P>
<P>
   As the election results were made official Tuesday, some Arab
officials spoke with fresh candor. ``There are positive signs that
Barak will bring peace,'' said Abdel-Meguid, the top Arab League
official.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in Egypt, the first Arab nation to make peace with Israel
but where many people have never fully accepted the accord,
bitterness could also be heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the Jews are the same, like Pepsi and Coca-Cola _ not
really very different,'' said Souad Hassouna, 60, a retired
teacher. Still, Mrs. Hassouna added, Barak might be ``a little more
tolerant'' than his defeated rival.

PALESTINIANS WELCOME NETANYAHU'S DEFEAT BUT ARE WARY ON BARAK 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMALLAH, West Bank _ Palestinians from the senior leadership to
the streets of Ramallah on Tuesday welcomed the vote that ousted
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu but stopped well short of
embracing his successor, Ehud Barak, who is viewed nervously as a
hawk in dove's clothing.
</P>
<P>
   From his office in Gaza City, Palestinian National Authority
leader Yasser Arafat telephoned Barak on Tuesday afternoon to
congratulate him on his victory and to get peace talks ``back on
the right track,'' said a spokesman in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in a closed-door session of cabinet ministers and
Palestine Liberation Organization leaders, Arafat warned that Barak
``could give us a hard time'' in peace negotiations, participants
said. Arafat stressed that Barak ``is one of Labor's hawks,'' said
Zakaria Alagha, who attended as a member of the PLO executive
committee.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was interrupted by an unexpected phone call from
President Clinton, who told Arafat that U.S. envoys will be
arriving soon to revive the stalled land-for-security pact,
Palestinian officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A Palestinian spokesman said Arafat asked Clinton to move
quickly ``to achieve a just, permanent, and comprehensive peace in
the region.''
</P>
<P>
   Alagha said later: ``Look, there was happiness in the room. We
were comforted by the defeat of Netanyahu, who was an obstacle to
the peace process. But we should be careful about Barak, especially
about his statements after the elections.''
</P>
<P>
   While Israelis listening to Barak's victory speeches Monday
night were struck by his emotional insistence on the strategic
benefits of peace, Palestinians interviewed Tuesday noted again and
again his vow not to stray outside ``four red lines'' in final
status negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Barak reiterated the four points that were the longstanding
Labor Party policy of the late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, saying
that Israel would not return to its pre-1967 borders, that it would
not relinquish sovereignty over ``unified'' Jerusalem or major
Jewish settlements in the West Bank, and that it would not permit
any modern military force to be physically located between Israel
and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the sentiment on the West Bank was that with new Israeli
leadership, there is some hope of new progress toward a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to defeat Netanyahu, because he stopped the peace
process for three years,'' said Fadel-Ahmad Tahboub, a member of
the Palestinian National Council, as he strolled along a crowded
sidewalk here Tuesday afternoon. ``Maybe it won't be so easy to
deal with Barak, but I doubt it would be worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Ali Laham, a staff aide at Orient House, the PLO's unofficial
Jerusalem headquarters, agreed. ``Netanyahu is impossible, Barak is
difficult,'' he said. ``That's the difference between them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the storefront coffee houses and falafel stands of Palestine
Avenue in Ramallah, many people professed to see little difference
between the Israeli candidates on the issues that matter to them:
independence, refugees' rights and the future of Jerusalem. And
nobody voluntarily seconded Arafat's public expressions of
``respect'' for the Israeli democratic process.
</P>
<P>
   Yet almost all acknowledged they had intently followed Monday
evening's election results, hoping for the defeat of Netanyahu,
whom they had come to view as an ideological enemy. And most
demonstrated an impressive intimacy with Israeli parliamentary
arithmetic, debating the various permutations of right, left, and
center that could give Barak a governing coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, they said that had Netanyahu been
re-elected, they would have interpreted it as a final rejection of
the possibility of peace by the broad Israeli public. That did not
happen, and many people in Ramallah said they were convinced that
most Israelis do want a settlement that would cede West Bank land
in exchange for Palestinian actions to insure Israeli security.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul Halim Abu Sharifeh is a 63-year-old Ramallah resident
whose family hurriedly fled their Mediterranean seaside home in
what is now Israel during the 1948 war of independence, never to
return. He watched Israeli election coverage until well past
midnight, he said, because he believed that Barak's character _
though not his policies _ offered a slight hope for reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Netanyahu's animosity toward Palestinians was obvious to the
whole world,'' he said. ``This man at least is ambiguous.''
</P>
<P>
   In annexed East Jerusalem, a hundred thousand Arabs of voting
age were eligible to vote in the election but refused to
participate because of a longstanding position that Jerusalem is
not part of Israel. The talk there Tuesday was of the resumption of
Jewish home-building projects in old Palestinian neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is obvious that it is because of the elections,'' said a
woman in traditional Muslim dress, who would identify herself only
as Tashrid. ``They want to prove that the power is still in their
hands.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was an unusually peaceful day at Orient House, the
century-old manor that Netanyahu had threatened to close because of
allegedly illegal Palestinian diplomatic activities there.
</P>
<P>
   Just a week ago, Orient House was packed with Palestinian
leaders steeled for a possibly violent confrontation with Israeli
police, who it was feared would be ordered onto the premises by the
government in a pre-election strike. A last-minute court injunction
averted an immediate crisis, and Palestinian officials are waiting
for a ruling on the closure order next Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Faisal Husseini, who runs Orient House and has been charged with
the Jerusalem brief in negotiations for the Palestinians, said
Tuesday that he worries that the Netanyahu government may still try
to shut it down before Barak takes office in June. But he suggested
that if legal appeals continued until then, a compromise could be
found.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would not be surprised to find out that Barak is a difficult
negotiator,'' Husseini said in an interview. ``But Netanyahu was
not trying to negotiate. He was trying to dictate.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the seemingly intractable issue of competing claims on
Jerusalem can be settled, Husseini insisted. ``The option of going
forward quickly is there,'' he said. ``We have the support of the
Israeli people, of the Palestinian people, of the United States,
and of the international community.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone here in Ramallah is convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not prefer Netanyahu or Barak, because I don't believe in
peace negotiations,'' said Ayed Shadid, an engineering student, as
he sipped coffee and puffed on a water pipe in a Palestine Avenue
cafe. ``I think we have a long armed struggle ahead of us. But we
need reason to hope, and we can hope that Barak will do
something.''

GRIEVING CRENSHAW TURNS TO HIS FRIENDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
Ben Crenshaw began his MasterCard Colonial preparations yesterday
with a heartfelt hug from Corey Pavin.
<TEXT>
<P>
   As he proceeded to the driving range to strike his first golf
shots in a month, Crenshaw collected handshakes and nods from
countless competitors and fans. Like Pavin, all wanted to express
condolences after the death of Crenshaw's father, who lost a long
battle with thyroid cancer last week.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Crenshaw, 85, was buried Thursday in Austin.
Understandably, Crenshaw's emotions still bubble to the surface
when he thinks of the man who introduced him to golf, as well as
longtime mentor Harvey Penick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't have been guided by two better people,'' Crenshaw
said, his voice cracking. ``Harvey was like a father figure to
everybody. He was a big influence in my life. But my dad was even
more so.''
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who have walked a mile in Crenshaw's golf spikes
understand the challenge he faces this week, as he attempts to
rejoin the work-a-day world after saying goodbye to a parent.
</P>
<P>
   It's never easy. Reminders are everywhere. The healing process
takes time, but it can be pushed along by encouraging words from
friends.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason why Crenshaw chose to play in his 29th
consecutive Colonial, an event he has won twice at a course that
features galleries filled with familiar faces. To him, it seemed a
comfortable and logical place to rejoin the PGA Tour wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this week had been a different event, I probably would be
skipping it. Absolutely,'' Crenshaw said. ``But the feeling of this
tournament is totally unique. I know a lot of people here, and the
folks have always been so friendly to me. You don't forget those
type of things.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very comfortable, relaxed place for me to come back to.
That's a nice tonic, right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Without question, Crenshaw will be in the thoughts and prayers
of fans and foes this week. As one of the game's classiest
ambassadors, he deserves that.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing that could happen this week would be sweeter, or more
poignant, than a final round with Crenshaw, 47, in the hunt for his
third plaid jacket. But don't expect a repeat of his 1995 Masters
triumph, which Crenshaw won four days after serving as a pallbearer
at Penick's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw hasn't survived a cut this season in six appearances at
PGA Tour events. Instead, he has been banking something far more
precious than paychecks: memories of quality time spent with his
father, his mother and his siblings, Charlie and Bonnie, during the
past month.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother and sister and I spent all the time we could with
Dad, right up to the end. For that, I'm thankful,'' said Crenshaw,
whose most recent competitive event was the Masters (April 8-11).
``Golf hasn't been much of a priority lately. It's been a long way
from my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Crenshaw headed to the driving range and swung a
club for the first time since leaving Augusta, Ga. He knows this
week will be challenging, especially from an emotional standpoint.
He welcomes your good wishes, even if you stop him between shots in
today's pro-am.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a nice thing,'' Crenshaw said. ``It's wonderful if
people want to say something. It's actually helpful and it means a
lot. Believe me, it means a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Crenshaw's voice wavered. Always one to wear his
emotions on his sleeve, he reflected on the difficulty of
maintaining his composure during competitive rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll just take that as it comes this week. Whatever happens,
happens,'' Crenshaw said. ``I'd like to play well. But mostly, it's
just nice to be back out here with friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Rest assured, Ben Crenshaw, you'll find plenty of friends
everywhere you turn this week at the MasterCard Colonial.
SPOTLIGHT ON ... Colonial to be Watson's final regular PGA event
Tom Watson, 49, said yesterday he plans for Colonial to be his
final career appearance at a non-major on the PGA Tour. Watson said
his remaining summer schedule will include only the U.S. Open and
British Open. He would add the PGA Championship, Watson said, if
given an exemption.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, said the defending Colonial champ, his summer
will be dedicated to vacation time and preparing himself for the
Senior PGA Tour. Watson turns 50 on Sept. 4, making him eligible to
make his Senior PGA Tour debut at the Comfort Classic (Sept. 10-12)
in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to sit back, take a deep breath and get into the best
mental and physical shape I can get in to come out fast on the
Senior Tour,'' Watson said. ``At this point, that means this will
be the last regular event I'll play before the Senior Tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, Watson said he became ``sentimental'' while
playing last week in his final GTE Byron Nelson Classic, an event
he won four times, and expects similar feelings this week at
Colonial.
CHIP SHOTS Persistent Pate Steve Pate could be forgiven if he is
starting to feel snakebit on Sunday afternoons.
</P>
<P>
   He has won more money than any nonwinner of the PGA Tour this
season ($1,334,637). But his near-victories have been
unforgettable.
</P>
<P>
   Pate lost to Loren Roberts in last week's playoff at the GTE
Byron Nelson Classic after both men established a tournament
scoring record (18-under 262). In January, Pate shot a closing 66
at the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic, but lost by a stroke to David
Duval, who finished with a 59, tying the lowest score in tour
history.
</P>
<P>
   Pate, 37, is philosophic about his close finishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you hang around the lead long enough, something good is
going to happen and you'll get a win,'' said Pate, who has finished
fourth or better in four events this season. ``If you can beat
everyone but one guy by seven strokes, eventually something will go
your way. I can't control what Loren did or what Duval did. I just
need to keep plugging away and trust that my time will come.''
Elkington arrives Steve Elkington, who withdrew from last year's
Colonial because of a bout with viral meningitis, arrived yesterday
and practiced on the course. Elkington, who had to withdraw May 1
from the Houston Open because of a meningitis-related relapse,
declined a request to visit the interview room yesterday. He
relayed word through PGA Tour officials that he was feeling fine
and is looking forward to competing at a tour event for the first
time in three weeks. No shutout here Alan Bratton, one of three
Fort Worth residents in the Colonial field, said he is confident
local pros will fare better than at the GTE Byron Nelson Classic.
In Irving, Tarrant County residents were 0-for-7 in surviving the
weekend cut.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the task falls to Bratton, Mark Brooks and Clark
Dennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, the Fort Worth guys can do a little better this
week,'' Bratton said. ``Maybe we were just saving it for the home
crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   Bratton, a tour rookie, is making his Colonial debut. Brooks is
10-of-15 in surviving Colonial cuts. Dennis is seven-of-eight.
INSIDE THE NUMBERS Sizing up the field Although glamour boys David
Duval and Tiger Woods are elsewhere this week, the Colonial field
stacks up favorably with predecessors of recent vintage. Below is a
look at the number of top-50 players from the season money list who
have competed in the past five Colonials: Season Top 50 1999 36

PHARMACEUTICAL FREEBIES AREN'T WHAT THEY USED TO BE ... AND THAT'S
GOOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I bagged nine ballpoint pens, five sticky-note pads, a name tag
for a stethoscope and an ``automatic printer'' that will stamp a
prescription for Viagra an estimated 2,000 times before it runs out
of ink.
</P>
<P>
   I also stuffed my sack with lots of candy, Combos cheese-filled
pretzels and samples of Aleve, Advil, Bayer and the new Pediatric
Advil Drops, all at this month's big meeting of the Texas Medical
Association in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   It's a far cry from the ``bad ol', good ol' days,'' when drug
companies tried to influence doctors with everything from free
tickets to Dallas Cowboys games to ``frequent flier'' awards,
whereby surgeons could earn points toward, say, a ski vacation each
time they implanted a particular heart valve.
</P>
<P>
   Since they became legal two years ago, TV and radio commercials
have taken a big bite out of advertising budgets, but
pharmaceutical companies still spend most of their promotional
funds _ $2.5 billion last year _ marketing directly to doctors.
</P>
<P>
   But the distribution of drug samples is now regulated by both
the Food and Drug Administration and the ethics policies of
professional medical organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major thing is the drug companies can't give anything that
would amount to more than about $100 as a gift,'' says Dr. Bob
Lanier, a Fort Worth allergist and president-elect of the Tarrant
County Medical Society. ``They can send doctors all over the world
to meetings as consultants within certain rules, such as you make a
presentation or spend a certain amount of time answering questions,
but any sort of gifting can't be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trips don't influence us in private practice,'' Lanier says.
``Does any doctor really want to leave an office where the overhead
goes on day after day (estimated at about $3,000 per day for most
doctors' offices) for an honorarium of $500 and a free trip? What
sense does that make?
</P>
<P>
   ``Payback doesn't happen, not often anyway, not anymore,'' he
says. ``You may get a lot of pens and pencils and note pads, but
that's not going to buy loyalty, and drug companies know that.''
</P>
<P>
   However, sample drugs and ``detail men,'' the drug company
representatives who come bearing the samples, can be a valuable
asset to physicians and their patients, Lanier and other medical
professionals say.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the appropriate information is provided to safely
utilize the medicine, the practice of doctors distributing free
drug samples is not offensive and can be to the patient's benefit,
in several ways,'' says Ed Eason, pharmacist at Cook Children's
Medical Center in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   It may be difficult for a parent with a small child to wait at a
pharmacy for the prescription to be filled, or the pharmacy might
be closed, Eason says.
</P>
<P>
   Free samples also are advantageous from a cost standpoint, he
notes. In some cases, providing free samples is the only way a
child is going to get the medication he needs.
</P>
<P>
   A pediatrician's patients are generally the poorest of the
population. Drug samples can be a godsend for a single mom who has
several sick kids at once, or a young working family without health
insurance, Lanier points out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you need to get a patient started on something right away,
and you look up in your sample closet and see a medicine that will
help the patient's problem, that does influence you _ not from the
standpoint of making money or making the drug company happy, but
being able to help your patient immediately,'' Lanier says. ``It's
human nature to want to help, and you depend in part on your drug
reps to be able to do that. People don't realize how expensive some
of the good, new drugs are.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of drugs approved for the same things _ maybe
four anti-hypertensive drugs or three antihistamines that all work
about the same and have the same side effects, Lanier says. In many
cases, deciding which one to use may come down to, do you have a
sample the patient can try?
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors don't have a lot of experience with some of the new
approved drugs, and often offer samples to see how patients like
them,'' says Lanier. ``Until there is some experience with a drug,
you are a little loathe to try it. You write a 'script for it, and
your patient calls you the next day and says, `This stuff tastes
like hell and makes me sleepy.'''
</P>
<P>
   Drug representatives are a primary source of information for
doctors in this country. They know all the details of how to best
use their products _ that's ``detailing'' _ and often are the first
to report to physicians on problems with the competition.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``They are an incredible resource in a global sense _ not any
one alone, but taken together as a group,'' says Lanier. ``If there
is a negative report published in one of the journals or in the
popular press about a competitor, a detail man is in your office
the next week telling you all about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Academia and the FDA don't like pharmaceutical reps. They
think they give a biased viewpoint _ which they do _ but if you
have time to listen to several of them, you see the pros and cons
of everything. Used correctly, doctors in the field get an
incredible amount of drug information from them.''
</P>
<P>
   At the recent TMA convention, several small-town physicians
asked drug reps to come by their offices with the latest
information and samples.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need them to help keep us up to date on the newest drugs
and provide samples we can give out, particularly to some of our
elderly patients who do not have the money or insurance to cover
new drugs like Viagra,'' said Dr. Brian Kingston, a family practice
physician from Eldorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drug reps can be very helpful. The trick is getting them into
small towns,'' Kingston said.
</P>
<P>
   Drug representatives hosted booths and answered lots of
questions about their products, while handing out goody bags and
gadgets, paper tablets and package inserts, research results and
promotional materials.
</P>
<P>
   The Cheddar cheese-filled Combos seemed a particularly clever
way to promote Amaryl, a new combination therapy for type 2
diabetes. The drug company reps simply attached a small sticker,
advertising their own combo, on the individual snack packages.
</P>
<P>
   I was sorry I missed out on one of the 300 tiny kits used to
repair eyeglasses, stamped with the name, ``Integrated Pathology
Services.'' The detail man representing the lab said visitors were
taking them by the handfuls the first two hours his booth was open.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Policies on drug samples
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Food and Drug Administration: The Prescription Drug and
Marketing Act permits a manufacturer or distributor to distribute
samples to a licensed practitioner or pharmacy of a health care
center by mail, common carrier or other means (marketing
representatives) upon written request.
</P>
<P>
   Certain drug sample records must be maintained by manufacturers.
Manufacturers and distributors must maintain drug samples in a
manner that will prevent their contamination, deterioration or
adulteration.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Pharmacy Association: Says executive director Paul Davis:
``We have a long-standing historical policy of opposing the
dispensing of sample drugs. For a long time we opposed the practice
because it was unregulated. Drugs were sent to salesmen who kept
them in the back seats or trunks of their cars with the sun beating
down 180 degrees, but more and more physicians are requesting drugs
directly from the pharmaceutical company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a problem with physicians providing samples as a
starter dose or to make sure someone is not allergic. We have a
problem with doctors routinely dispensing drugs, but we have a good
state law that prohibits doctors from for-profit dispensing.''
</P>
<P>
   American Medical Association: Continues to support the practice
of physicians providing drug samples to selected patients at no
charge, according to a policy last revised in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The AMA's policy covering ``Gifts to Physicians from Industry,''
updated in June 1996, warns that ``there has been growing concern
about certain gifts'' and says that gifts accepted by physicians
should primarily entail a benefit to patients and should not be of
substantial value.
</P>
<P>
   Gifts of minimal value are permissible as long as they are
related to a physician's work, such as pens and note pads.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Medical Association: Pharmaceutical samples must be
provided to the physician without cost from the manufacturer and
delivered at no cost either directly or indirectly to the patient.
They must be prepackaged by the manufacturer and not repackaged.
They must be marked as samples or recorded in records indicating
they are samples, which records shall be accessible as provided
under state and federal law.

WOOLEY FINDS OSTEOPATH HAS JUST THE RIGHT MAGIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO _ Ah, nothing like a relaxing day off in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Sabres defenseman Jason Woolley arose at the crack of dawn
Monday, plenty of time to play 18 and grab a leisurely lunch at the
club. Except he had other priorities.
</P>
<P>
   His groin, injured against the Bruins in the next-to-last
regular-season game, had ``seized up,'' as he put it, during the
second period Sunday and forced him to miss the rest of Buffalo's
5-3 loss at Boston in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference semifinals.
Not wanting to be a spectator in Game 6, Woolley sought treatment.
But his idea of medical attention didn't involve a stop in the
trainer's room at Marine Midland Arena or a drive to the
neighborhood professional building.
</P>
<P>
   Woolley caught a 6:30 a.m. flight to Detroit, then drove to East
Lansing to visit the doctor in whom he has placed implicit faith
since his college days at Michigan State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a torn abdominal muscle seven years ago,'' said Woolley.
``My career was in jeopardy. He fixed it. I've been seeing him for
years.''
</P>
<P>
   And who might this medical marvel be?
</P>
<P>
   ``Last name Brumm,'' said Woolley. ``First name Lynn. Middle
name Magic.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, this groin guru was just the doctor Woolley
ordered.
</P>
<P>
   ``He worked his magic,'' said the defenseman, ``and it loosened
up.''
</P>
<P>
   That was no surprise to the patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's unbelievable,'' said Woolley. ``He's a semiretired
osteopath who still treats Michigan State players. I told him I
won't allow him to retire until I retire.''
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't a career-threatening problem, but it was bothersome
nonetheless. For the past month, Woolley inadvertently had been
favoring one groin over the other until he finally could take no
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a pulled muscle or anything,'' he said. ``It was a
cartilage out of alignment, like it was steering off the road a
little.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to play through pretty much everything at this time
of year, but there are some injuries that limit you to not being
there. You've got guys who are healthy scratches and are itching to
play, and it's selfish if you're hurt to put yourself in when you
can't really contribute.''
</P>
<P>
   That was no longer an issue after Brumm's ministrations, and the
rejuvenated Woolley headed to the Detroit airport for an
early-evening return to Buffalo and a good night's rest.
</P>
<P>
   Or so he'd planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a nightmare,'' he said. ``I got there at 7 and didn't
get in (to Buffalo) until 11:30.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he was continually delayed and frustrated by
airport snags that turned his original itinerary into a travel
adventure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was running through there in sandals,'' said Woolley. ``I
had to test the groin a lot earlier than I wanted.'
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, it was worth the aggravation. Woolley was at Marine
Midland Tuesday morning, when he joined a handful of teammates for
an optional skate and reported afterward, ``I feel real good. I
don't feel there's any problem now.''
</P>
<P>
   Which was just the elixir the Sabres had been hoping for. Coach
Lindy Ruff gladly included Woolley in his lineup, meaning the
Sabres had the indispensable quarterback of their power play back.
</P>
<P>
   Now if only Dr. Lynn ``Magic'' Brumm made house calls.

TOP US REFUGEE OFFICIAL TO RESIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The top US official for managing refugee issues in
the Balkans, who had been nominated to be ambassador to Brazil,
says he is leaving government because of his treatment at the hands
of Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Jesse A. Helms.
</P>
<P>
   J. Brian Atwood, who has spent 30 years in a variety of
Democratic Party and foreign affairs posts, said he has asked the
president to withdraw the ambassadorial nomination because he is
convinced Helms, a North Carolina Republican, would block it
indefinitely in retribution for a political clash between the men
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was the latest in a chain of prominent ambassadorial
nominations to be nixed by Helms, including the nomination of
William Weld to be ambassador to Mexico and that of Robert Pastor
to be the emissary to Panama. The position of chief US delegate to
the United Nations has been vacant throughout the Kosovo crisis
largely because Helms has blocked the nomination of Richard C.
Holbrooke to that post.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department said 22 ambassador-level nominations are
pending before the committee. About half of the nominees have not
been given preliminary hearings.
</P>
<P>
   James Foley, a State Department spokesman, refused to comment on
Helms's hobbling of the president's ambassadorial nominees. He said
Secretary of State Albright ``has an excellent relationship with
Senator Helms that's really been one of the hallmarks of her
tenure. . . . She likes and respects the senator.''
</P>
<P>
   Helms's office referred inquiries to the foreign relations
committee staff, which did not respond.
</P>
<P>
   Atwood, who is 56, said Tuesday that Helms's animus ``clearly
goes back'' to his role in the Clinton administration's successful
effort to defeat a Helms scheme to merge the US Agency for
International Development, the US Information Agency, and the Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency into the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody has to do something about this. It just isn't the
right way to do business,'' said Atwood, who has been administrator
of AID since May 1993. ``I was defending the administration
position. I don't think I violated any of the standards of debate
in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   However, his assertion at the time that it was not up to the
legislative branch to restructure the foreign affairs agencies of
the government, and his statement to senators that ``we shouldn't
accept a plan written by Senator Helms on the back of an envelope''
apparently touched a nerve.
</P>
<P>
   Emissaries dispatched to feel Helms out on the nomination in
recent weeks returned with word that the senator remembered, and
resented, the comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a couple good sources ask him would this just be''
extracting ``a pound of flesh, making me suffer, then letting it
pass, or would it be a William Weld'' _ with the suffering followed
by rejection _ ``and they came back and said `William Weld,' ''
Atwood said. ``I just decided I didn't want to end up the way Weld
did. . . . You have to know the ways of the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Sources said a complicating factor was that, before the problem
with Helms became apparent, the president designated J. Brady
Anderson, an old associate who was special assistant to Clinton
when the president was governor of Arkansas, to succeed Atwood. The
nomination has not been announced publicly, but is widely known
within the administration, and Anderson already has completed much
of the intense screening given to nominees whose appointments
require senate confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   Atwood said he would continue ``for a brief time'' as
administrator of AID and as chairman of the president's Council for
Humanitarian Relief for Kosovo, but ``didn't want people to think
I'd be around through the end of the administration.''
</P>
<P>
   The former Boston University football star said he had no plans
what he will do when he steps out of those jobs ``but I've always
wanted to go back to Wareham (Mass., his hometown).''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think maybe I could be a foreman on the line where people
check the cranberries,'' he joked. ``I honestly would love to come
back to Massachusetts in some capacity. I've done well in
Washington, but it is not home.''
</P>
<P>
   More likely, he could wind up on the foreign policy staff in the
presidential campaign of Vice President Al Gore. He is close to
Gore and Gore's foreign policy adviser, Leon Furth, and while he
said he has not talked with them, ``if I were not in government I'd
want to do what I could to help.''

 &HT;    BellSouth investigates expansion of reach to include Southeast
U.S.
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ To boldly go, where no phone company has gone before.
</P>
<P>
   At least, not exactly. BellSouth has been talking with satellite
companies in the hope of expanding its television service from a
handful of cities to the entire Southeast. Other phone providers
have partnerships with satellite companies, but BellSouth would
sell its own Americast service via satellite delivery. And by using
satellites, BellSouth's service could also seek out new customers,
who live behind trees and hills in homes where signals from
earthboundantennas cannot reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just a theory,'' said Phil Jacobs, president of
BellSouth Georgia. ``We are seriously considering alternative
distribution methods for our Americast programming and this appears
to be a realistic alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based BellSouth has kept the possibility of a satellite
strategy secret, and negotiations might still fall through. But if
BellSouth does make a deal, it would be buying the capacity to
blanket the southeast _ or even the rest of the United States _
with signals. The move would be both dramatic defense and audacious
offense. BellSouth would likely spend tens of millions of dollars
in the hope of increasing the loyalty of customers it already has
for phone service, while stretching to supply services it now
offers to only a relative handful.
</P>
<P>
   For a company that typically tries to please investors with
steady profits gleaned mostly from its core business in local phone
service, launch of a space strategy for television would be bold.
No other regional phone company has launched its own service,
although others, including Bell Atlantic and SBC, have signed
partnerships in which the satellite company's service is marketed
to their customers, said analyst Bruce Leichtman. ``This is
different. They would need their own hardware and that is not
inexpensive. This is a major, major effort if they do this. This
would be very interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth has only tinkered with television, offering it now via
``wireless cable.'' The service is broadcast only from towers, so
transmissions can be blocked by hills, trees and _ after a few
dozen miles _ the curve of the earth. Moreover, the earth-based
service requires purchase of a franchise license. BellSouth's
Americast service is now offered wirelessly in Orlando, Atlanta,
New Orleans and Jacksonville. BellSouth provides the service via
high-speed wires in Vestavia Hills, Ala. and Daniel Island, S.C. To
be a customer for BellSouth's wireless service, a customer must
have a receiver placed on a roof or tree that has an unobstructed
view to a broadcast antenna. In metro Atlanta, there are four.
Standard installation costs about $100, and basic service _ more
than 100 channels of television, music and pay-per-view movies,
runs $36.49 a month.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth was thrilled last summer to have tens of thousands of
calls from potential customers who either hated their cable company
or just wanted to check out the new service. But bad news was soon
evident: thousands of consumers lived too far away, or in gullies,
or on the back sides of hills or behind so many trees that the
signal couldn't get through.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been frustration. For BellSouth, knowing that
millions of dollars in potential monthly revenue were perched just
out of reach. And for some customers, being offered something they
could not get. But with a satellite, BellSouth's signal could reach
out and touch virtually any U.S. household.
</P>
<P>
   That capability would thrust BellSouth into a new arena, giving
it a way to woo millions of customers who now get television from
cable companies. Leichtman said. ``But they'd be competing as much
with DirecTV and Echo as with the cable companies. This is highly
aggressive and it's risky to be the third (direct broadcast
satellite) provider. I'm not sure why they would do this instead of
partnering with DBS.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jacobs said a partnership could not take full advantage of
either the brand name or the Americast programming that BellSouth
has been marketing. ``We've negotiated for content and built what
we think is a superior product. We've already got a stake in the
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the move parallels previous BellSouth decisions to
make sure that a product is labeled BellSouth. When it was time to
offer Internet service, BellSouth could have repackaged an existing
provider. Instead, BellSouth built its own _ albeit with
behind-the-scenes aid from IBM. After a zig-zag strategy on paging,
BellSouth bought RAM Mobile Data but operates it as a subsidiary
that uses the BellSouth name.
</P>
<P>
   As a defensive gambit, satellite could add one more key service
that BellSouth customers could receive under the BellSouth name.
And _ so the reasoning goes _ the more services a customer has with
BellSouth, the less likely a switch to someone else.
</P>
<P>
   And increasingly, there are choices.
</P>
<P>
   Other competitive phone companies are offering bundles of
services in competition with the Bells, but most have focused on
business customers. Even if _ like MGC Communications _ they do
serve residents, they still do not string wires to customer homes,
and they lease the use of that ``last mile'' from BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to cable companies, a customer could leave the
BellSouth network completely.
</P>
<P>
   The Bells have expected for years that they would eventually
face a souped-up offering from cable companies. By upgrading their
systems, cable companies could provide high-speed Internet access,
digital television and phone service too. But only a fraction of
cable lines have been retooled, giving the phone companies an
opportunity to trot out new services themselves and cement
relationships with customers. BellSouth's negotiations with the
satellite companies have been under way for months. But perhaps
they have a new urgency now that AT&AMP;T's has slammed more than $100
billion on the table to buy two of the nation's top cable
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes sense for BellSouth to not only expand its product
mix but also find new ways to deliver advanced services to
customers,'' said telecommunications analyst Jeff Kagan. ``This is
important for them to remain competitive in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   A satellite ploy poses several dangers. First, is financial. If
BellSouth spends too much on equipment and satellite leases, and if
customers do not immediately flock to the service, profits could be
hurt. BellSouth has in the past been reluctant to make investments
that would dilute earnings. In the wake of the AT&AMP;T purchase of
MediaOne, BellSouth officials dismissed calls for dramatically
higher investment, arguing that they can do what is needed without
sacrificing even short-term earnings growth.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Bacurin, analyst with JC Bradford &AMP; Co. said that dilution
of earnings depends on ``the scale and scope'' of the satellite
investment. ``My guess is, if they do this, they'd have to do it
aggressively. They are going to have to hit this hard and fast.''
</P>
<P>
   MCI WorldCom chief executive Bernard Ebbers has generally been
able to persuade investors to stay on board as he spends billions
to get the market position he wants. AT&AMP;T too, once a conservative
stock, has managed a face-lift that lets shareholders think of it
as a growth company. To keep investors from jumping ship, BellSouth
too must repackage its image, and satellite could help convince
Wall Street of the need to think big and spend big _ even if it
means a short-term whack to earnings, Bacurin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bernie did it. AT&AMP;T is going to do it. The Bells have to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T and the cable companies are betting on one wire _ the
upgraded cable that may take years and billions of dollars to
complete, but will in a single connection offer customers phone,
video and high-speed Internet access. BellSouth is headed toward a
kind of mix and match, with phone and high-speed service over
digital subscriber lines and television via the air _ whether by
satellite or not.
</P>
<P>
   If a deal can be forged as hoped, BellSouth could be in the
satellite business by early next year. With that plan, the company
can vow to give customers through the Southeast a smorgasbord of
choices, Jacobs said. ``I am looking at it as what the market
wants. We intend to maintain our leadership position in the
industry.''

CHINESE HATRED FOR US WANES QUICKLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ When President Clinton charmed his way through China
last year, praising the Chinese and pledging growing friendship,
the joke here was that he had unseated basketball star Michael
Jordan as China's favorite American.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, after NATO's errant bombing of the Chinese embassy in
Belgrade, Clinton suddenly became Enemy Number One. The
state-controlled media and ordinary people alike denounced him as a
murderer and condemned the United States as a ``hegemonist'' power
intent on dominating China.
</P>
<P>
   Yet after four days, furious anti-American protests involving as
many as 400,000 people in 20 cities subsided. That is mostly
because authorities who first encouraged the rock-throwing
demonstrations decided to halt them. But it is also true that the
worst public vitriol seems to have drained away. Here in the
capital, calls to boycott American goods have gone largely unheeded
and Americans are walking the streets unbothered. Greatly
diminished are the angry taunts of a week ago, when numerous
Americans were chastised by strangers.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the first time the pendulum of Chinese public opinion
has swung radically against the United States, nor is it likely to
be the last. But while it will take time and considerable effort to
rebuild the damaged relationship between the governments in Beijing
and Washington, ordinary Chinese people's sentiments toward America
may be quicker to heal.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is both admired and resented here, reflecting
a love-hate relationship between the Chinese public and all things
American. To be sure, Chinese people are genuinely furious about
the bombing; almost anyone from laborers to professors believes the
attack was an intentional plot to bully their nation, and the
government has fed that belief by delaying news of Clinton's
apology. But while suspicion of all foreign powers runs deep in
China, true hatred of Americans is rare.
</P>
<P>
   There are many practical reasons for that. American investment
creates jobs and brings technology to China. The United States is
China's second-largest trading partner, and tourism by Americans
feeds millions of dollars into the economy.
</P>
<P>
   At a MacDonald's restaurant, filled Tuesday with its usual
lunchtime Chinese crowd, cashier Qin Lin reasoned that ``American
companies did nothing wrong. This has nothing to do with American
business or American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond economics, there are more subtle reasons for the
conflicted views of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feelings of nationalism and cosmopolitanism are very
complicated in China. A lot of China's problems in the last 150
years since the Opium War have come from weakness to the outside
world,'' said Shi Jinghuan, a professor of education at Beijing
Normal University. ``People want to learn high technology from
Western countries, but they feel unhappy when the country we most
want to learn from doesn't treat us the way we want to be
treated.''
</P>
<P>
   Much in the way that India feels disrespected and denied its
rightful place in world affairs _ prompting it to test nuclear
devices to prove its muscle last year, China has long felt put down
by foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese schoolchildren are taught that after 5,000 years of
proud history, a weak China was humiliated and colonized in the
19th and 20th centuries. Communist China, founded in 1949, was then
isolated and marginalized for decades, largely by the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   A sense of pride mixed with inferiority runs deep; Chinese are
taught that their ancestors invented paper, printing, gunpowder,
and the compass, but that foreigners applied those inventions in
modern, useful ways. Belief in the superiority of Chinese
civilization, coupled with the shame of being subjugated by outside
``barbarians,'' has fed xenophobia and nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   Technology and modern ideas are seen as the ticket to catching
up with the West. But adopting select concepts while retaining
``Chinese characteristics'' is not always easy, leaving many here
with feelings of envy and resentment.
</P>
<P>
   American products are best-sellers here; they are considered the
height of modernity, but evoke frustration that Chinese technology
and design has not matched America's. American television, movies,
and music are hugely popular and widely imitated, but are also
resented for sidelining traditional culture. American liberties are
admired and envied, but also suspected of feeding crime, divorce,
and a host of social ills more prevalent in the West than in a
nation that has been regimented and isolated for most of its
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't really hate Americans. It's like love _ you can't
explain why,'' said a 29-year-old man who works for a US company.
``I felt embarrassed to shout `Down with America' this week. Ever
since the Open Door policy, America has become the symbol of
freedom, high technology, the good life, modernity, excitement. . .
. Some people spend many years waiting for a visa to go to the US.
So when we say we hate America, it's not really deep-seated.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, hatred of Japan, which colonized China and perpetrated
wartime atrocities, comes far more naturally to many Chinese than
anti-Americanism.
</P>
<P>
   In one protest in front of the US Embassy last week, a tired
student leader accidentally shouted, ``Down with the Japanese'' _
and her classmates automatically echoed the call. When she tried to
correct herself, one shouted, ``That's OK. The Japanese are worse.
Down with the Japanese!''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese leaders have long stoked suspicion of foreign nations,
and the NATO bombing offered a perfect example of a supposed plot
against China. Meanwhile, allegations of Chinese misdeeds, such as
the theft of American military secrets, are not reported in the
press, promoting a one-sided view.
</P>
<P>
   In one of countless similar commentaries, the People's Daily
said Friday that Western powers led by the United States are using
``political, economic, military and diplomatic means to obstruct
and destroy China's development.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a powerful message, but as contact with foreigners and
access to the outside world expands, not everyone is buying it.
</P>
<P>
   Deng Zaoheng, 55, a housewife, said the bombing, though
horrible, hasn't turned her against the United States. ``We still
hope relations between China and the US will continue developing,''
she said. ``We need each other.''

California's reduced welfare benefits for newcomers to the state,
the court relied on a portion of the 14th amendment that forbids
states to ``abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the
United States.'' This is the long-neglected privileges or
immunities clause, the sudden resurrection of which, by a broad
7-to-2 majority, was certainly one of the most surprising and
perhaps one of the most consequential developments of the term. By

SETTLERS WASTE NO TIME CHALLENGING BARAK 
</HEADLINE>
  (With ISRAEL and related stories) 
(mk) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Laying down a challenge to Ehud Barak a day after he
was elected Israel's prime minister, Jewish settlers began digging
foundations Tuesday for a new housing complex in an Arab
neighborhood of East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The project, which has drawn protests from Palestinians and
expressions of concern from the Clinton administration, is financed
by Dr. Irving Moskowitz, an Orthodox Jewish millionaire from Miami
who has paid for other Jewish settlement projects in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The start of work came as settlement leaders and the rest of the
political right in Israel were reeling from the election of Barak,
the Labor Party leader, and from a poor showing by rightist parties
in the vote for Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Casting about for an effective strategy to challenge Barak with
a weakened parliamentary opposition, some rightist leaders are
contemplating a return to street protests and settlement actions.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's move in Jerusalem appeared to be the first shot of a
new campaign. A bulldozer rumbled onto a plot owned by Moskowitz in
the Ras al-Amud neighborhood at the foot of the Mount of Olives,
and began carving out a trench in the rocky soil.
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for the construction of 132 housing units in the
neighborhood where about 11,000 Palestinians live. A building
permit has been issued by the Jerusalem Municipality, and a
spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was defeated
in the election on Monday, said he had no grounds to intervene
unless there was a danger to public security.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has pressed Netanyahu to block
construction at the site, arguing that it could prejudice future
negotiations on Jerusalem as part of a final peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians view East Jerusalem, which was captured by Israel
in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, as the capital of a future
Palestinian state. Israel asserts that it will forever remain part
of its indivisible capital, a claim reaffirmed by Barak in his
victory speech on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Matti Dan, a representative of Moskowitz and a leader of the
Ateret Cohanim settlement group, contended that the work had been
delayed until after Monday's balloting to avoid inflaming the
election campaign, but he suggested that it was a signal to Barak.
</P>
<P>
   The next prime minister, he noted, had ``declared that he would
preserve a united Jerusalem, and I don't believe that he will
change his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Moskowitz said in a written statement that the changes in the
neighborhood were ``in complete harmony with the concept of an
eternally united Jerusalem under exclusive Jewish sovereignty _ an
idea endorsed by all Jewish political parties and Jewish prime
ministerial candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak's victory has sent shock waves through the settlement
movement. Pinchas Wallerstein, the chairman of the Settlers
Council, the umbrella organization of the Jewish settlers'
movement, announced his resignation, saying he bore some of the
responsibility for the parliamentary maneuvering that toppled
Netanyahu's government and brought early elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``That move was a mistake,'' he said, referring to the vote
against Netanyahu by rightist lawmakers opposed to relinquishing
West Bank land under the Wye River Memorandum signed with the
Palestinians in October.
</P>
<P>
   A group of eight legislators who joined forces to form a new
rightist party, the National Union, managed to garner only three
parliamentary seats in the election, indicating that the
overwhelming majority of Israelis had accepted the idea of ceding
West Bank land for peace.
</P>
<P>
   The National Religious Party, another group that speaks for the
settlers, went from nine parliamentary seats to five after losing
some of its members to the National Union. Recriminations flew
Tuesday between members of both parties as they blamed each other
for their poor showing.
</P>
<P>
   Hanan Porat, one of the defectors to the National Union,
attributed his party's showing to public indifference after the Wye
agreement was frozen by Netanyahu in the months before the
elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strange silence in those days prevented the public from
realizing that there was a critical issue on the agenda,'' Porat
said. ``We failed to raise it with sufficient intensity.''

   BOSTON -- In a key step in its planned merger with BankBoston

   The plan, crafted to meet antitrust requirements, calls for 292
Fleet and BankBoston branches throughout New England, with $12.5
billion in deposits and $5 billion in commercial loans, to be sold
in three lots. Fleet originally had envisioned selling around 270
branches.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, spelled out in a regulatory filing by Fleet,
permits one buyer to make a play for all three lots. It also allows
smaller local banks to bid for a tiny part of the deposit portion
of those packages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really talking about two types of divestiture,'' said
Duncan Johnson, a lawyer with Providence-based Edwards &AMP; Angell.
</P>
<P>
   But smaller banks, which are hankering for a stab at the assets,
might not want to jump up and dance just yet.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful that regulators are keen to see a new, large competitor
in New England to compete with the combined Fleet-BankBoston, Fleet
has structured its divestiture plan in ways that make it difficult
or impractical for many smaller banks to bid. As such, the two
types of divestiture may yet yield one result _ a giant,
out-of-region buyer that instantly gains access to one of banking's
most lucrative markets by buying everything up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``The likelihood of seeing assets go in small packages runs into
all sorts of'' hurdles, Johnson said, referring to minimum capital
requirements or local bidders located too far afield of the assets
on offer. ``Fleet may well have (out of region) bidders that want
everything in sight.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleet said its divestiture proposal exceeds regulatory
requirements on market concentration, which in Massachusetts limit
any one bank to no more than 30 percent of deposits. In
Massachusetts, the largest of the New England markets, Fleet said
its proposal exceeded Federal Reserve guidelines by 37 percent;
overall, Fleet says it is selling $4 billion more in deposits than
required.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two companies wanted a proposal that is so reasonable that
regulators can't turn it down,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet and BankBoston propose to sell:
</P>
<P>
   --A Massachusetts/New Hampshire lot, comprising 209 Fleet
branches (196 in Massachusetts) with $8.7 billion in deposits, 416
automated teller machines, and $1.8 billion in small and
middle-market loans. Viewed as a stand-alone institution, the lot
constitutes the largest divestiture in US history and will rank
among the top 50 banks in the country. Approximately $7.2 billion
of the divested amount is in the Boston market. The package
excludes $5.4 billion in deposits related to Fleet's Advanta Corp.
credit card unit.
</P>
<P>
   --A Rhode Island lot, with 46 BankBoston branches and two Fleet
branches, all with $2.2 billion in deposits and $223 million in
loans.
</P>
<P>
   --A Connecticut lot, comprising 33 BankBoston branches, mainly
in Hartford and Torrington, with $1.5 billion in deposits and $150
million in loans.
</P>
<P>
   As they seek regulatory approval to combine into the nation's
eighth-largest bank, Fleet and BankBoston are waging a battle on
two fronts. On the local side, community banks are fighting to
avoid being muscled out of the market by a big bank from outside
the region. On the federal side _ the main focus _ the two banks
are working to appease the Federal Reserve Board and the Justice
Department, both of which want a major new competitor in the
region. The $16 billion merger of New England's two largest banks,
announced in March, marks the first time that a major region will
be left without two large banks. Citizens Financial Group Inc.,
which will become the area's second largest player after the deal,
is still only a fraction of the combined bank's size.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet and BankBoston do not plan any divestitures in New Haven,
New London, Fairfield, Greenfield, Springfield, Portland,
Manchester, or West Palm Beach, Fla. The two banks are likely to
close or relocate overlapping branches in those markets, Fleet
spokesman James Mahoney said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet filed its divestiture proposal with state banking
regulators in four New England states and the Federal Reserve Bank
of Boston. The Fed has 30 days to raise objections. Fleet plans to
send out bidding applications in the next two weeks.

FED STANDS PAT ON RATES, BUT ISSUES WARNING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal Reserve policy makers Tuesday put the
nation on notice that they might raise interest rates soon in an
attempt to fight inflation. But they said prices were not rising
enough that they had to act right away.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks plummeted on the prospect of higher rates, which would
slow the economy. The Dow Jones industrial average had gained 77
points by early afternoon, but the Fed announcement triggered a
112-point fall. The Dow ended the day down 16.52, closing at
10,836.95.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a warning from the Fed,'' said Oscar Gonzalez, an
economist at John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance in Boston. ``If
inflation is not yet at our doorstep, it's certainly not too far
away. So, I think this was an appropriate warning.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's policy making body, the Federal Open Market Committee,
voted during a closed-door meeting to make no change in the target
federal funds rate, which is now 4.75 percent. That is the rate
banks charge each other on overnight loans, but it also influences
a variety of other short-term interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the committee released a brief statement
saying it ``was concerned about the potential for a buildup of
inflationary imbalances that could undermine the favorable
performance of the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of that fear, the committee is now ``tilted toward the
possibility'' of raising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation has remained low in recent years, a remarkable
development given that labor markets are tight, which tends to
force businesses to raise wages, and Americans are on a spending
spree, which tends to allow businesses to raise prices.
</P>
<P>
   Economists have suggested that a jump in business productivity
has helped keep price increases to a minimum, as businesses can
turn out more goods with the same amount of resources.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists also note that the Asian financial crisis has
cut the demand for oil, copper, corn, and other commodities
steeply, sending prices to record lows and helping keep inflation
in check.
</P>
<P>
   But that could change. In its statement, the Fed committee said
``foreign economic prospects have improved,'' suggesting that Asian
nations and others caught in the global economic downturn might
begin buying goods again, prompting the prices of both commodities
and finished goods to rise.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Labor Department reported the largest one-month
spike in inflation in nine years. Consumer prices rose 0.7 percent
in April, the department said, and was up 0.4 percent even after
the volatile food and energy components were stripped out.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the Commerce Department reported that construction of
new homes fell 10.1 percent in April, the biggest drop in nearly
five years.
</P>
<P>
   Economists said the figures did not signal an economic slowdown
or decline in consumer spending. Instead, they said, an
unseasonably warm winter had probably shifted some construction
usually done in the spring to the winter months.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the Fed's job is to fight inflation, which erodes the
value of wages and adds uncertainty to the economy. The Fed can
tame inflation by raising interest rates, which raises the cost of
borrowing money.
</P>
<P>
   People then buy fewer items on credit, and businesses borrow
less money for expansion. As the economy cools, workers have less
power to demand higher wages, and businesses cannot raise prices as
easily _ keeping inflation in check.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts now expect the Fed panel to raise interest rates
in the next six months, though it may wait until August rather than
act at its next meeting, June 29 and 30. But there is no guarantee
a rate hike will occur. Cynthia Latta, chief US economist at
Standard &AMP; Poor's/DRI, a Lexington, Mass. forecasting firm, noted
that the Fed Tuesday said only that it had ``tilted toward the
possiblity'' of higher rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very hedged statement,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Tuesday's developments showed that for the Fed, talk is a
form of action and can move markets. The Fed has been using talk as
a tool more often in recent years. Once notoriously silent about
its intentions, the Fed recently adopted a policy of releasing
statements about its views and possible future actions.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts suggested that the Fed wanted to ``jawbone''
the bond market into raising rates, which would cool the economy in
the same way Fed rate hikes would. In this way, the Fed could
achieve its goal without actually taking action. ``I think the Fed
would be quite happy to have the bond market do that, do its work
for it,'' said Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Latta and other analysts said the Fed was compelled to signal in
some way that it was concerned about inflation. If not, it would
lose credibility as an inflation fighter, and investors and
businesses might feel it was insufficiently guarding against
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is very concerned about inflation,'' Latta said.
``They think it's a problem. So they would have reacted badly if
the Fed showed no concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Allan Meltzer, an economist at Carnegie Mellon University in
Pittsburgh, believes the Fed has shown insufficient concern about
inflation. He is chairman of the Shadow Open Market Committee,
which follows Fed actions and has recommended an interest rate
increase for about six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're behind the curve, in my judgment, and have let things
get a little out of hand _ not terribly, but a little out of
hand,'' Meltzer said, referring to recent signs of rising
inflation.

HONG KONG SEEKS CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW IN MIGRANT CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ In what critics are calling the worst threat to Hong
Kong's autonomy since the former British colony was returned to
China in 1997, the local government said Tuesday it would ask
Beijing to reinterpret the territory's constitution to block a
flood of migrants from mainland China.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa and his Cabinet said they had no
choice but to ask China to override a Hong Kong supreme court
ruling granting residency to all mainland-born children of Hong
Kong residents _ including illegitimate children and children born
before their parents gained citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Tung will ask Beijing to throw out the court ruling and narrow
residency rights to children born after their parents became
residents, a move that the government says would cut those eligible
to 200,000, from 1.67 million. Tung's announcement followed a
three-week government drumbeat of doomsday predictions if Hong Kong
were forced to accommodate a tidal wave of new arrivals.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's legal community and opposition legislators decried
the decision, calling it a violation of Hong Kong's judicial
independence. Tung's request to Beijing makes a mockery of the
Court of Final Appeal, the supreme court, and opens the door for
the government to reject any court ruling it dislikes, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the government is doing is to teach the five judges a
lesson for not ruling in their favor,'' said Martin Lee, chairman
of the opposition Democratic Party and a prominent lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such a move,'' he said, ``would cause untold damage to the
rule of law, the independence of the judiciary, the `one
country-two systems' arrangement and the so-called `high degree of
autonomy' Hong Kong is supposed to enjoy.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``one country-two systems'' model promises capitalist Hong
Kong autonomy from communist China on all matters other than
defense and foreign affairs. Under the Basic Law, Hong Kong's
postcolonial constitution, the former colony was allowed to retain
its British legal system, and its Court of Final Appeal was to be
the final arbiter of law.
</P>
<P>
   The government insists the request is an exceptional case and in
the best interest of Hong Kong, which could not afford a projected
25 percent increase in its 6.8 million population over the next 13
years. The government has said taxpayers would have to spend $92
billion for new infrastructure and $4 billion annually for social
services to accommodate the new arrivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is only on such extraordinary issues that we take such
unusual steps,'' Tung said. ``Truly, Hong Kong cannot accept such a
huge population growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the government has inflated the figures of people
eligible for residency to scare the public. If the government's
survey is accurate, 692,000 people would be immediately eligible to
move here, but 20 percent of people surveyed said they did not
expect their mainland-born children to come.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong already accepts 150 mainland immigrants a day.
Accommodating all of the newly eligible people in a timely manner,
however, would require raising the quota to a number somewhere
between several hundred and 1,000 a day, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing has repeatedly said in recent months that it would
prefer Hong Kong to settle the matter itself but would assist the
territory if asked for help. Under the Basic Law, the standing
committee of the National People's Congress _ China's rubber-stamp
parliament _ can ``reinterpret'' Hong Kong's constitution, or the
congress as a whole can vote to amend the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
   Democracy advocates and lawyers say it would be preferable to
amend the Basic Law to limit residency rights rather than overturn
the court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials say it would take too long to amend the
constitution, since the congress as a whole will not meet again
till next March _ too late to block an expected wave of arrivals.
The standing committee of the National People's Congress meets next
month.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of demonstrators on both sides of the issue chanted and
waved banners throughout the day outside the legislature. Polls
indicate most locals fear the arrival of migrants and disagree with
the court ruling.

NEW JORDAN KING CONFIDENT PEACE EFFORT WILL BE RENEWED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ King Abdullah of Jordan expressed confidence
Tuesday that Middle East peace efforts will be revived following
the election of Labor party leader Ehud Barak as Israeli prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   On his first visit to the White House since he assumed the
throne after the death of his father, King Hussein, Abdullah said
Barak's victory over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu left him
``very, very optimistic'' about the prospects for peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see eye to eye on many issues, and we're very optimistic of
taking the peace process forward,'' he said, adding that he met
with Barak in Jordan shortly before the election.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah made his comments during a photo session with President
Clinton in the Oval Office. Jordan, a key player in the peace
process, is a significant US ally in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who had a close relationship with the king's father
until his death Feb. 7, has said that Hussein, despite his poor
health, helped move forward the peace talks at the Wye River
Plantation in Maryland last year during the critical final hours.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah's renewed optimism about peace in the Middle East
parallels the US government's belief that the change in Israel's
leadership may help break a months-long deadlock between the
Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   US officials are anxious to resume talks on the shape of a final
settlement for the Palestinians, and the timetable for
implementation of the Wye agreement that would have Israel pull
back from another 13.1 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has proposed a one-year period for completing the
``final status'' talks, which would plow over some of the most
thorny issues in the Arab-Israeli conflict. They include Jewish
settlements, the borders and status of a Palestinian entity, rival
claims to Arab East Jerusalem and the fate of Palestinian refugees
in the diaspora.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Abdullah both telephoned Barak after he defeated
Netanyahu in Monday's election, 56 percent to 43 percent. Clinton
also telephoned Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat Tuesday to
reaffirm the US interest in moving the peace process forward, a
senior administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   The president said the push for peace wouldn't begin immediately
but would have to wait until Barak has had time to put together a
new government, which could determine the tenor of peace talks. ``I
think General Barak is entitled to a few days to put a government
together,'' Clinton said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said he was encouraged that Barak has shown ``an
intention to continue the peace process. And if he's willing to do
it, I think that we're certainly both willing to do it and we're
hopeful that we'll have a chance to do so,'' Clinton said as the
37-year-old monarch sat at his side.
</P>
<P>
   The president said that while work remains on the final status
issues in the Wye accord, ``I think the roadmap is out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say they expect Abdullah to follow in
his father's footsteps and play an active role in peace talks. ``I
think it is the universal sense on the American side that the king
has already grown in office, even in just these short several
months,'' the administration official said. ``And as a leader, he
has already shown an impressive ability to stand up in a tough
neighborhood and make himself a player.''
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders also discussed Jordan's faltering economy. ``We
are also very committed to Jordan's economic renewal,'' Clinton
said.

BYRD FAMILY VOWS TO KEEP FIGHTING FOR PASSAGE OF TEXAS HATE CRIMES
BILL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICHARD STEWART 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ The family of a black man who was dragged behind
a pickup until his body broke into pieces vowed Tuesday to keep
working for passage of a state hate crimes bill named in his honor.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the state Senate failed to pass the proposed James
Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Act last week, ``we don't consider it as a
defeat,'' said Byrd's daughter, Francis Renee Mullins, 28, of
Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   She pledged to return to Texas next year after the birth of her
second child, expected in October, to lobby legislators for passage
of the bill. ``We're going to go to the legislators and ask them,
`what if it was your father, or brother or son, or even your pet,'
because not even an animal should be treated this way,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her cousin, Darrell Verrett, of Houston, agreed that the family
will continue to fight for the bill, ``if it takes a couple of
years or a couple of days.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's mother, Stella Byrd, said she realizes that the bill
``can't help my son, but it might help some other mother from going
through what I went through.'' She said the bill might mean
``people won't be afraid to go to school or to go to church.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill would have increased the penalties for certain crimes
if they were motivated by hate; murder and capital murder cases
would not have been affected.
</P>
<P>
   Mullins said she was disappointed the bill didn't pass, but
stopped short of blaming Senate Republicans who opposed the bill
because it included gays and lesbians among the groups that are
specified as potential victims of hate crimes. ``Republicans,
they're humans too,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Verrett said he and other family members often worked until 2
a.m. to try to convince legislators to approve the bill or to help
work out compromises that would get the bill passed. ``I am
confident that it will some day be passed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush never promised to back the bill, Mullins
said, but did assure her that he would give it serious
consideration if it made it to his desk. She said President Clinton
``assured us he would do everything in his power'' to get it
passed.
</P>
<P>
   She said her father always told her there's a time and place for
everything. ``There'll be a time for this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's father, James Byrd Sr., said his family holds no
bitterness toward anybody over the death of his son, but wants
justice. ``We're not cowards either,'' he said. ``We want to live
together in peace and harmony.''
</P>
<P>
   Jasper County District Attorney Guy James Gray met with Mullins
and Verrett earlier in the day amid speculation that political
leaders wanted them to call off their press conference.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said he never asked them to call off the press conference,
but asked them to refrain from making statements that may impact
getting juries in the upcoming trials of two men accused of Byrd's
murder. Mullins and Verrett said they never felt pressured not to
talk.
</P>
<P>
   In response to reporters' questions in Austin, the Department of
Public Safety on Tuesday afternoon also issued a denial that any
officers had urged the family to cancel the press conference.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said legislators had asked him and Jasper Sheriff Billy
Rowles to make statements or campaign for the Byrd bill, but they
refused, he said, because their job is to enforce the law, not make
it. ``You've got to stay focused,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One man, John William ``Bill'' King, 24, has already been
sentenced to death for Byrd's murder. The trial of Lawrence Russell
Brewer Jr., 32, is scheduled to begin in August in Bryan. Shawn
Berry, 24, is due to be tried in Jasper in October.

BUSH SUPPORTERS DOING ALL BUT MEASURING WHITE HOUSE CURTAINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JAY ROOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ From the Capitol in Austin to the marbled
corridors of Washington power, supporters of Gov. George W. Bush
have all but begun measuring the curtains at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that it's a long way to November _ 2000 _ or that
there is a GOP nomination contest to contend with first.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the many blown leads in U.S. political history,
confidence is running so high in some circles that there is already
talk of a Cabinet-in-waiting and a unified Republican agenda for
the George W. Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Legislature is moving to clarify the state
constitution to ensure what Bush's would-be successor, Lt. Gov.
Rick Perry, called an ``orderly transfer of power.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only are people assuming he's going to win, I think most
of them have already served in the Bush administration and have
started thinking about which college they want to teach at,'' said
Bill Miller, an Austin political consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Miller and other observers recognize that Bush could win. The
huge campaign war chest and unprecedented endorsements he has
gathered even though he hasn't formally announced his candidacy
have cemented his reputation as a formidable contender.
</P>
<P>
   But experts warn that the overconfidence and high expectations
surrounding his candidacy underscore the danger of assuming
anything about presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people forget is there are nine other candidates and
hundreds of staffers for those candidates who are plotting 24 hours
a day on how to take George W. down,'' said Larry Sabato, a
University of Virginia political analyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is far from a done deal. There could be some shocked
egos,'' he said. ``Voters do not like to be taken for granted. They
want to be the ones making the decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in an exchange with reporters last week, emphasized that
he is taking nothing for granted. For example, he disputed the
notion that he is formulating an agenda with members of Congress
for a unified 2000 agenda _ months before a presidential nominee is
selected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's presumptuous at this point and time for any
candidate to be trying to figure out a general election strategy
when someone doesn't have the nomination,'' Bush said. ``First
things first. I've got to get out there and start shaking hands and
looking people in the eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bush's operatives have readily disclosed that
discussions, focusing both on 2000 politics and 2001 policy, have
been under way on the Bush network.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., a member of Bush's exploratory committee,
told the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call that congressional
leaders are trying to create ``not only an election strategy but a
governance strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes told The New York Times
that the talks centered on ``the agenda that would emerge from the
2000 presidential campaign should Governor Bush be elected
president.''
</P>
<P>
   If friendly members of Congress seem confident of a Bush
presidency, their enthusiasm has nothing on some Texas lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's pretty much a bygone conclusion, at least in my
perception, that (Bush) will be the next president,'' said state
Sen. Ken Armbrister, a conservative Democrat from Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   Armbrister is one of several people who may be players in the
succession battle that would emerge should Bush move on to higher
political ground.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, anticipating the possibility of a vacancy in the
governor's office, is expected to give final approval as early as
Wednesday to a constitutional amendment that would ensure that
Perry vacates his old job if he becomes governor under that
scenario. The amendment is subject to the voters' approval.
</P>
<P>
   Current language could be interpreted to read that the
lieutenant governor could keep both jobs. The new language would
require senators to conduct an internal election to pick a new
lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nation's eyes are focused on Texas and our great
governor,'' Perry said in a written statement. ``So this is an
appropriate time to consider the orderly transfer of power.''
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of a vacancy in the lieutenant governor's office
has touched off a subtle campaign for the job _ somewhat like House
speaker races _ several senators have said.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. John Whitmire, D-Houston, said members are bending
over backward to be nice to each other so they'll have some chits
to cash in if there is an opening to fill.
</P>
<P>
   He said members have been taking each other to dinner and taking
full advantage of any ``opportunities to show leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like some of those folks, when they get up there and
they have the gavel on the podium for a little while, it seems like
they just stand a little more erect than they used to,'' Whitmire
said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the warnings about high expectations, some in the
Bush camp say it beats being on the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Michican Gov. John Engler, who has helped pull in endorsements
and money for the governor, said that candidates should ``always
guard against overconfidence,'' but that at least the Bush camp has
something to be confident about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize that sort of the higher up in the polls you are the
more is exposed and being shot at by everyone else,'' he said.
``But again, I'd rather be there than down at the bottom trying to
get on a poll or having made two inches of headway.''

BOY SCOUT OFFICIALS, UNITARIANS REOPEN GAY ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Accusing the Boy Scouts of America of discrimination, the
Unitarian Universalist Association Tuesday vowed to defy the
organization's latest order to stop giving religious awards to
scouts who are Unitarians.
</P>
<P>
   After apparently reaching a compromise on a dispute that has
raged between the two groups over their opposing views on gays, the
Boy Scouts of America revoked the authority it had again granted
the Unitarians to give out the awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they intend to start ripping badges off scout uniforms when
our children earn a religious award, they are going to look very
peculiar,'' said John A. Buehrens, president of the
250,000-denomination. ``We will continue to award the badge and our
young people will continue to earn it.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Unitarian officials had agreed to remove all
language in a church manual that promoted gay rights and criticized
the Boy Scouts views on homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   The Boy Scouts consider homosexuality immoral and forbid gays
from joining the organization. Last May, the Scouts, reacting to
the ``Religion in Life'' manual, told the Unitarians not to give
out the award.
</P>
<P>
   But as part of what Unitarians say was their agreement with the
Boy Scouts, church officials would include a separate statement
when it distributes the religion manual making it clear the
Unitarians strongly disagree with the Boy Scouts position on gays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two Boy Scout officials sat here in my office and said it was
okay,'' Buehrens said. A liberal denomination with historical roots
in New England, the Unitarian Universalist Association is
headquartered in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But a Boy Scouts spokesman said the separate document was never
discussed as part of any compromise. ``It was not discussed in the
meeting,'' said Gregg Shields. ``That document reopens the whole
issue of using boys as a venue to air the Unitarian Universalist
Association's objection to scouting's commitment to duty, to God
and to traditional family values.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Buehrens, ``It's clear to me that we are being
discriminated against because we have some principles that make
them uncomfortable.''

 &HT;    Security First aims to lead pack
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The gold, analysts say, is in the visitors and in the
code.
</P>
<P>
   To make money on the Internet, you must bring people to your Web
site or write code that creates software that makes Web sites worth
visiting.
</P>
<P>
   Security First Technologies took a big step this week toward
being the software company that banks turn to when they want to set
up shop online.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta company announced Monday it will use about $1.4
billion in stock to buy two of its competitors: Edify, in Silicon
Valley, Calif., and FICS, in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the infrastructure. We are the Cisco of our world,''
said James ``Chip'' Mahan, Security First chief executive officer,
referring to Cisco Systems, the company that makes the pipes
through which much of the Internet's information flows.
</P>
<P>
   The deals create a company with about 1,500 employees, to be
called S1. The deals require approval by Edify and Security First
shareholders. They are expected to be completed by October.
</P>
<P>
   The new Atlanta-based company hopes to dominate the market for
software that lets people, small businesses and corporations handle
their money on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Security First competed with Edify in retail and small-business
banking markets. FICS sells online banking financial reporting
software to banks.
</P>
<P>
   The international market for retail Internet banking software
was $500 million last year, according to Dove Associates, a
Boston-based management consulting firm. But analysts say the
market is just getting its legs. Dove expects it to grow by 40
percent per year, reaching $2.7 billion by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is lots of opportunity out there and now there are that
many more people working to put it out to market that much more
quickly,'' said Steve Franco, an analyst with U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray.
</P>
<P>
   Franco said the relative newness of the online banking market is
``why it makes sense to consolidate now instead of competing
head-to-head as they all keep expanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahan said he started working on the deal six weeks ago. He
considered a second public offering, then called FICS when he heard
it was thinking about going public.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I struggled with is I'm not a spring chicken
anymore. I'll be 48 next week,'' he said. ``Today, S1 could be a
real powerhouse. But I figured, let's just go for it. With this
move, I don't think you can catch us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way the software business works,'' he said.
``There's a big, big winner and everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Security First Technologies grew out of a family get-together in
1993. Mahan was a banker, operating Cardinal Bancshares, based in
Lexington, Ky. Mahan's brother-in-law, Michael McChesney, ran
SecureWare, a security software firm. At the gathering, Mahan and
McChesney decided to put a bank on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Security First Network Bank was the result. Launched in 1995, it
was the first Internet bank, but it was not profitable. Last fall
Mahan sold the Internet bank to Royal Bank of Canada for $20
million. The remaining software company was called Security First
Technologies. Royal Bank is now a customer of Security First,
paying $50 million to put banking services online.
</P>
<P>
   Security First Technologies is based in Buckhead, near Lenox
Square mall. The company also has a 50,000-square-foot data center
in Norcross, Ga. A 72,000-square-foot expansion of the facility is
scheduled for completion by August.
</P>
<P>
   Gartner Group's Avivah Litan said the companies that will do
well in the technology field will be ones that possess either the
customers or the software.
</P>
<P>
   ``Security First is a very hot-to-trot company,'' Litan said.
``Hot, fast-moving and very innovative.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors have agreed, sending Security First's stock up 228.7
percent so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   But they have not yet decided what to make of this week's
acquisitions. Shares of Security First dropped Tuesday for the
second straight day. Shares closed at $50.12 1/2, down 87 1/2
cents.

REPORT CITES VULNERABILITY OF RUSSIAN NUCLEAR MATERIALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nuclear materials that could be used to build bombs are spread
throughout locations in Russia, and the security systems in place
to guard them are more vulnerable than had been previously
estimated, according to a new report issued Tuesday by the National
Research Council.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the report said, despite efforts in recent years to
address these problems, there is not even a reliable inventory of
the weapons-grade uranium and plutonium in Russia, making it
impossible to know whether any has been stolen or moved out of the
country. The independent group recommends a minimum expenditure of
$725 million over five years to continue a joint US-Russian program
to analyze and address the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although joint efforts by Russia and the United States have
strengthened security at many sites,'' said Richard Meserve, head
of the committee that prepared the report, ``we believe that
terrorist groups or rogue nations have more opportunity to gain
access to Russian plutonium and highly enriched uranium than
previously estimated.''
</P>
<P>
   Some progress has been made, the committee said. For example,
protection systems in several buildings where the materials are
stored have been greatly improved, and hundreds of kilograms of the
material that had been widely distributed has been consolidated
into fewer sites, making security more manageable.
</P>
<P>
   But, the group added, Russia's recent financial woes have
produced such hardship for many officials, nuclear specialists and
workers who have access to the sites that there is now an ``added
incentive for materials to be stolen or sold illegally.''
</P>
<P>
   At some facilities, the report said, guards have not been paid
for months and have not been given adequate food or clothing for
outside patrols.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the report estimated, about 1,350 metric tons of
plutonium and highly enriched uranium are located in many different
kinds of facilities throughout Russia. About half is already in the
form of nuclear weapons, and the remainder is in a variety of
different forms, including scrap material. One suitcase full of
either material would be sufficient to make a nuclear bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The committee analyzed only the non-weapons material. Among
their recommendations: Consolidate the material into fewer
buildings to improve security; support Russian organizations to
build up that nation's ability to better manage its stockpiles;
complete a thorough accounting of the material now in Russia to
allow it to be tracked; and devise ways of protecting large
quantities of spent nuclear fuel left over from naval uses and
experimental reactors.
</P>
<P>
   The National Research Council is a private, nonprofit
institution chartered by the US Congress to provide independent
advice on matters of science and technology.
</P>
<P>
   The panel said the government has requested $145 million for
fiscal 2000 to continue a joint program to improve the security for
these materials, and strongly recommended that funding be
maintained at that level for at least the next five years, and at
``adequate'' levels thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   With greater access to Russian nuclear facilities, the report
said, ``the US government has identified more extensive dispersion
of material and more pervasive inadequacies of protection systems
than had been anticipated.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, it concluded, ``the gravity of the threat has
increased.''

 &HT;    Delta insists air system safe, but perception a worry
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ What worries Delta Air Lines is not the millennium bug
but people's perception of it.
</P>
<P>
   All of the airline's critical computer systems have been fixed
to recognize and process the year 2000. Yet there are increasing
reports in the media that people are scared to fly after the first
of next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's our biggest concern,'' says Walter Taylor, vice
president of airline operation systems and Y2K program manager at
Delta. ``We're worried that people will be afraid to fly even
though our airlines and air system is safe.''
</P>
<P>
   That prompted an aggressive Delta publicity campaign. The idea
is to counter the perception flying will be unsafe because of the
millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting people out to speak about what we've done about
Y2K to the public and industry groups,'' says Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Flying Delta would have been problematic if the Atlanta-based
airline had done nothing to address the millennium bug. This bug
hinders computers large and small from recognizing dates after the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   For Delta, that would have meant computer reservation systems
spitting out wrong information or shutting down. That's why the
airline moved early to stomp out this bug. It hasn't been easy or
cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Delta budgeted $125 million to identify potential Y2K problems
and fix them.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the hard part wasn't fixing the bug. The hard part was
analyzing how that fix would ripple through the computer systems as
a whole. In short, the trick was to identify any unintended
consequences from the fix.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest challenge is making sure you've taken care of the
entire problem,'' says Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   The next challenge was designing a reliable testing program to
make sure Delta had caught every problem. Designing a good test
took two months alone last summer, says Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is for Delta to ensure that its suppliers and the
Federal Aviation Administration are also progressing on fixing Y2K
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're meeting with all our suppliers face to face,'' says
Taylor. ``Boeing has told us in writing that its planes are safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor is also pleased with what the FAA has done. ``The FAA has
done a good job in fixing the technical problems,'' says Taylor.
``But it hasn't done such a good job in conveying that message to
the public.''

IN A RULING ON WELFARE, HIGH COURT TAKES SMALL STEP ON A NEW PATH 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In constitutional law, as in geology, things can
look perfectly stable on the surface _ until the tectonic plates
shift underneath.
</P>
<P>
   As the Supreme Court term heads into its final weeks, the
question is whether such a shift may be underway. In its decision
on Monday striking down California's reduced welfare benefits for
newcomers to the state, the court relied on a portion of the 14th
Amendment that forbids states to ``abridge the privileges or
immunities of citizens of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the long-neglected privileges or immunities clause, the
sudden resurrection of which, by a broad 7-to-2 majority, was
certainly one of the most surprising as well as possibly one of the
most consequential constitutional developments in years.
</P>
<P>
   The 14th Amendment, ratified in 1868 to constitutionalize the
outcome of the Civil War, contains the much-invoked guarantees of
due process and equal protection. The privileges or immunities
clause actually precedes these, in the first paragraph of the
amendment, and there is historical evidence that the amendment's
drafters regarded it as the most important guarantee of all.
</P>
<P>
   But the clause was sent into early eclipse by a 1873 Supreme
Court decision known as the Slaughter-House cases, which held that
the clause protected only the rights of national citizenship and
placed no new obligations on the states.
</P>
<P>
   So by turning back to this long-buried language, the court was
taking at least a tentative step on a new path of constitutional
analysis. While the ultimate destination is uncertain, it holds
obvious appeal for both conservatives, who see the clause as a new
source of protection for property and economic rights, and for
weary liberals, who see it as a means for protecting individual
rights without having to fight endless battles over the meaning of
``due process.''
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, justices across the ideological spectrum signed this
opinion, from John Paul Stevens, its author and arguably the
court's most liberal member, to Antonin Scalia, one of the most
conservative. While Justice Clarence Thomas dissented, he made
clear his enthusiasm for reconsidering the privileges or immunities
clause in an ``appropriate case.''
</P>
<P>
   That left Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, oddly isolated in
his complaint that ``the court today breathes new life into the
previously dormant privileges or immunities clause,'' an
observation that the majority did not refute.
</P>
<P>
   The justices who came together in the case, Saenz v. Roe, did
not necessarily do so for the same reasons, or with the same
expectations of where this new opening might lead. The privileges
or immunities clause has been invisible for so long that there are
few recognizable signposts, and there were no concurring opinions
by which individual members of the majority might have elaborated
on the analysis.
</P>
<P>
   But at the least, to carry the geological analogy a step
further, the opinion undoubtedly achieved a release of doctrinal
tension much as an earthquake relieves pressure that builds up
under the earth's crust.
</P>
<P>
   The two-tiered welfare program challenged in this case was quite
clearly unconstitutional under the court's most directly relevant
precedent, a 1969 decision called Shapiro v. Thompson which invoked
a constitutional ``right to travel'' to bar states from denying
welfare benefits during a newcomer's first year of residency.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there was probably no member of the current court completely
at ease with the analytic method that produced Shapiro v. Thompson.
That decision represented a kind of high water mark of the Warren
Court's open-ended approach to constitutional analysis _ so much so
that Chief Justice Earl Warren himself dissented from Justice
William J. Brennan's majority opinion, which candidly conceded that
the right to travel was not anchored to any particular place in the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no occasion to ascribe the source of this right to
travel interstate to a particular constitutional provision,''
Brennan wrote. It goes without saying that there are no Warren
Court-style liberals on the court today. Briefs from a group of
states and other interested parties in the current case urged the
justices simply to overrule the 1969 precedent.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, in Stevens' practiced hands, the right to travel did
not disappear but morphed into a right of national citizenship that
each state is obliged to honor and that, more to the point, has a
solid foundation in the Constitution's text. For the court's
moderate justices, the privileges or immunities clause offers a
comfort zone that permits them to defend individual rights while
shedding the baggage of liberal methodology.
</P>
<P>
   For conservatives, particularly those with libertarian leanings,
the appeal of the clause is even more clear. There is no dispute
that, as a matter of history, the privileges the amendment's
drafter's sought to protect included the right to earn a living,
enter into contracts, and acquire and maintain property free of
government interference.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The privileges and immunities clause should be used to restore
``the fundamental connection between the Constitution and its
natural law foundations,'' Roger Pilon, director of constitutional
studies for the Cato Institute, a libertarian think-tank here,
wrote in a law review article several months ago.
</P>
<P>
   One result would be, Pilon argues persuasively, to raise the
level of protection for economic rights, which receive only minimal
scrutiny under current constitutional analysis, to the level of
protection given to individual rights that under the current
approach are deemed ``fundamental.''
</P>
<P>
   In any event, it is clear that the justices in a sense are
simply catching up with a lively discussion that has been going on
for some time among legal academics and constitutional historians.
A broad, although by no means universal, consensus has emerged that
the Slaughter-House decision of 1873 was a mistake, or at least
ripe for a serious reexamination.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the court has spoken, however tentatively, that
conversation will expand to a wider audience. Arguments based on
privileges or immunities will be developed in law review articles
and presented to lower court judges, who in turn will write
opinions that will provide more raw material for the court, if the
justices want to use it to move further down the new path.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the court does not act in isolation from the rest of the
legal system, cases on its docket do not exist in isolation from
one another. Between now and the end of next month, the justices
will announce decisions in three major federalism cases. It would
be surprising if the court does not continue on its recent course
of shifting power away from Congress and to the states, a result
the states are actively seeking.
</P>
<P>
   But new power may come with a price if, as California learned on
Monday, the court at the same time is placing new obligations on
the states to safeguard the rights of all their citizens.

U.S., JORDAN HOPE BARAK VICTORY REVIVES PEACE PROCESS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and Jordan's King Abdullah, both
advocates of revived Middle East peace talks, welcomed Tuesday the
election of a new Israeli prime minister as an opportunity get the
process back on track.
</P>
<P>
   The election of Labor Party candidate Ehud Barak, Israel's most
decorated soldier, over incumbent Benjamin Netanyahu has raised
hopes with the administration that a regional settlement may be
possible. Barak also has signaled his willingness to negotiate with
Syria and Lebanon as well as the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said Clinton and King Abdullah
``expressed confidence that the Middle East peace process will now
be reinvigorated and strengthened, and hopefully brought to a
successful conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told reporters he was encouraged because ``the whole
issue of the peace process was an issue (in the elections); and I
think because of his military service the question of General
Barak's devotion to the security of Israel is not in question.''
</P>
<P>
   The president, sitting beside King Abdullah prior to their
private meeting, said Barak ``has evidenced an intention to
continue the peace process. And if he's willing to do it, I think
that we're certainly both willing to do it and we're hopeful that
we'll have a chance to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   King Abdullah noted Barak visited Jordan recently. ``We see eye
to eye on many issues, and we're very optimistic of taking the
peace process forward,'' the King said. He called the Israeli
elections ``very, very optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also called Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to reassure
him that the United States remained committed to the Wye River
Accords, which calls on Israel to withdraw from additional portions
of the West Bank and sets out a timetable for additional
negotiations on such critical issues as the status of Jerusalem and
of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an accord at Wye to implement, and we have a lot of
work to do on the final status issues,'' Clinton told reporters.
``I think the road map is out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton publicly expressed no feelings about Netanyahu's defeat,
but the White House undoubtedly will be glad to see him go.
Netanyahu, head of the Likud Party and a favorite of Christian
conservatives in the United States, came under fire from
hard-liners within his coalition after signing the Wye River
accord. He, in turn, accused Palestinians of doing too little on
the security front and suspended implementation of agreement only
weeks after signing it.
</P>
<P>
   A personal appeal by Clinton stopped Arafat from declaring
statehood for Palestine on May 4, the original deadline for
completing the so-called final status talks. Such a declaration
likely would have rattled the Israeli elections.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said the president looks
forward to the Israeli-Palestinian peace track moving
expeditiously.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to move forward on this process as quickly as
possible. And I can tell you that the president has a very high
sense of urgency about it. He is invigorated by the prospects of
getting back to work on this,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House visit was the first by King Abdullah who
inherited his position upon the death of his father, King Hussein,
in February. King Hussein, though suffering from cancer at the
time, was instrumental in convincing the Israelis and Palestinians
to sign the Wye River accord.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein's death came at a critical time for Middle East
peace negotiations, but administration officials said King Abdullah
is following in his father's footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is the universal sense on the American side that
the King has already grown in office, even in these short several
months. And as a leader he has already shown an impressive ability
to stand up in a tough neighborhood and make himself a player,'' a
senior aide said.
</P>
<P>
   King Abdullah also was seeking economic support for his county,
which is having economic problems. Clinton agreed to seek support
from European nations for either debt forgiveness or restructuring
to relieve the burden on Jordan.

CONGRESS MAKING SPENDING CUTS IT ADMITS ARE PAINFUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional Republicans on Tuesday completed a
plan to cut domestic spending by tens of billions of dollars next
year. Their leaders warned it would cause ``sticker shock'' and
political pain. The White House called it ``a blueprint for
political chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   Slashing domestic spending by 11 percent might seem strange at a
time of budget surpluses and economic prosperity. But in 1997,
Congress and the White House agreed to spending caps to force down
federal expenditures. They are now chafing under the restraints
they embraced.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts will come in spending categories covering education,
job training, housing, health and human services, environmental
protection, medical and high-tech research, diplomacy and foreign
aid, among other federal programs. These follow $53 billion in
domestic spending reductions since the Republicans won control of
Congress in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all knew this was going to be painful,'' said House
Majority Leader Dick Armey on Tuesday. He said there would be
``sticker shock now in realizing just how difficult it will be'' to
stick to the spending caps.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning, the House Appropriations Committee will slice
up a $538 billion budget pie _ what's left of the $1.75 trillion
budget after paying for mandatory programs like Medicare _ for its
13 subcommittees. Under its plan, the Pentagon will receive about
$270 billion _ more than half the money. Every other government
agency would receive an aggregate of about $268 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's final spending draft for fiscal 2000, which will
be formally approved Wednesday, contains $26.3 billion in cuts for
domestic spending, about 11 percent less than what Congress meted
out for this year, and a $18.9 billion increase for the military,
up about 7.5 percent, committee members said.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress are moaning, ```Oh, oh, oh, we can't live up
to that,''' said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott. ``It's tough,
but it ought to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials, along with some congressional Republicans
and Democrats, warned that the plan could lead to political
confrontation and presidential vetoes. Some predicted a repeat of
last year's spending stalemate, which ended in a frenzied,
last-minute omnibus spending bill larded with $21 billion in
extras. Others remembered the standoff that led to a government
shutdown in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican budget is a blueprint for chaos,'' said White
House Budget Director Jacob Lew. ``These allocations are a sign of
that. They would have unacceptable consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats point out that the caps have shrunk domestic
non-defense spending down to its smallest share of the national
economy since 1962. They also helped create a budget surplus, but
at a cost. Not all Republicans agree they still make sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's hardly a member of Congress that doesn't realize the
caps will be lifted,'' said Rep. John Edward Porter of Illinois, a
senior Republican on the Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But lifting the caps could violate solemn promises made by
Republican leaders. It could result in more spending taken from
surplus Social Security funds, and it could blunt Republican plans
for tax cuts, splintering two of the biggest planks in their
political platform for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Porter is one of 13 House Appropriations subcommittee chairmen _
they are called Congress' college of cardinals _ who will divide
the $538 billion in discretionary spending Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   His subcommittee, which oversees labor, education and health
programs, would receive nearly $11 billion less than last year. The
subcommittee overseeing the Veterans Administration and the
Department of Housing and Urban Development would take a $5.8
billion cut; the one overseeing the Commerce, State and Justice
Departments, a $2.8 billion cut; the Interior Department, $2.7
billion; foreign operations, $2.4 billion. The subcommittees must
figure out how to divide their allocations and pay for their
programs under the caps before the fiscal year ends on Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, at least, the caps were irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   The House was set to pass an emergency spending bill of nearly
$15 billion, twice what President Clinton requested, financing
NATO's air war in Yugoslavia, relief for refugees in Kosovo, and
aid for disaster victims in the United States and Central America,
along with billions in military projects.
</P>
<P>
   About $13 billion will come from surplus Social Security funds.
That money is designated as an emergency appropriation, meaning it
does not count under the spending caps. Most of the rest will come
from food stamp and low-income housing funds designated as surplus
and unlikely to be spent this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate will take up the bill later this week. Clinton has
indicated he will sign it.

WHEN SARGENT TURNED HIS BACK ON FASHION  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 23) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Deborah Weisgall's most recent article for Arts and Leisure was
about the photographer Abelardo Morell.  
 By DEBORAH WEISGALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ For half his life, from 1890, when he was at the height
of his career, until his death in 1925, John Singer Sargent was
under contract to produce murals and decorative schemes for public
buildings in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The son of an expatriate New England doctor, Sargent lived
mostly in Europe; but in Boston he had close friends and family,
and he visited often. Boston was the American city closest to his
European sensibility; it understood him best.
</P>
<P>
   And thanks to ``Sargent Summer,'' a series of exhibitions timed
to coincide with the last stop of the Sargent retrospective at the
Museum of Fine Arts (June 27 through Sept. 26), Boston is once
again the city where one can come to a new understanding of the
reticent artist and his art.
</P>
<P>
   An exhibition at the Fogg Art Museum, ``Sargent in the Studio:
Drawings, Sketchbooks and Oil Sketches'' (June 10 through Sept. 5),
drawn from its own collections, focuses on the private Sargent, on
the work he made for himself, including many preparatory studies
and the model for the Boston Public Library murals.
</P>
<P>
   The show begins with sketchbooks Sargent kept from the time he
was 16, with highly accomplished penciled landscapes punctuated
with impish caricatures. It includes a breathtaking watercolor
study for his notorious ``Madame X'' (Madame Gautreau), which
captures the lady's hawklike allure.
</P>
<P>
   The Fogg also owns a group of oil sketches that Sargent made on
a trip to Morocco at the beginning of his career. A bath house, a
street scene: the paint seems brushed quick as thought; the
atmosphere is intimate, charged with sensuality as Sargent embraces
North Africa's heat and light and its exotic interiors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sargent: The Late Landscapes'' at the Isabella Stewart Gardner
Museum (through Sept. 26), considers the artist during the years
1905 to 1917, when he had for the most part grown weary of painting
the portraits of the rich and famous that had made his reputation
on both continents. Sargent spent half of every year traveling; at
the outbreak of the World War I he was detained in the Austrian
Tyrol. During the war, he spent some time in America, and traveled
to Florida and the Canadian Rockies. ``Yoho Falls,'' which Gardner
commissioned from his expedition West, anchors the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Outdoors, Sargent looked close, seeking pattern, light and
emotional effect: the rocky violence of a swath cut by an
avalanche, a waterfall's incessant, maddening spray and thunder.
Like the waterlilies that his friend Monet was painting at this
time, Sargent's landscapes verge on claustrophobia. Everything _
rocks, water, foliage _ strains against the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Erica Hirschler, associate curator of paintings at the Museum of
Fine Arts, points out that in these paintings, the difference
between oil and watercolor blurs. Sargent leaves canvas bare,
startling and white, as if it were paper, or he lays on watercolor
dry and thick. Figures _ Sargent almost always traveled with
friends and family _ melt into the landscape, dappled with light
like leaves and tree trunks, painted in the same palette of blues,
browns and greens.
</P>
<P>
   Grandeur in landscape never interested Sargent, but in his
murals he sought monumentality. Boston, of course, is where the
murals are on permanent exhibition. They are surprising, often
astonishing, often dazzling, and so unlike Sargent's more familiar
images that it is possible to look right at them and not recognize
the hand that painted them.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they are good is a complicated question. They are
important; Sargent considered these cycles, painted for the Boston
Public Library, Widener Library at Harvard and the Museum of Fine
Arts, an increasingly significant part of his work.
</P>
<P>
   In 1907, Sargent announced his retirement from painting
portraits, largely to concentrate on murals. But even the critics
and art historians who were his contemporaries disagreed with
Sargent's own assessment of those projects; Bernard Berenson
condemned the work for the Museum of Fine Arts as ``inappropriate''
and ``ladylike.'' Heavy with allegory and message, the murals were
painted in a style that was already out of date.
</P>
<P>
   Boston, however, cared little for the new. The Armory Show of
1913 came here before it went to New York, but Bostonians ignored
Duchamp and Matisse and their revolutionary art. While the Boston
exhibitions will not expose Sargent as an American fauve, they will
reveal how difficult it is to label him.
</P>
<P>
   In 1910, Roger Fry, the influential British critic, listed
Sargent among the post-Impressionists. Sargent was furious and said
so publicly. As a young man in Paris, he had exhibited with the
Impressionists, but in 1884, he left Paris, stung by the scandal
his radical portrait of Madame Gautreau had caused. And he had
always hedged his bets by also sending paintings to the traditional
Salon.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the 20th century, which seems more interested in
life than in art, Sargent's elusiveness remains frustrating. He
dropped no hints of secrets in letters or art and rarely alluded to
how life affected him. He never married, but remained close to his
sister Emily.
</P>
<P>
   Tongue-tied and awkward in society, he was funny and
affectionate with his friends (Henry James, Gardner and Gabriel
Faure, among others) as his portraits of them attest. He was a fine
pianist and said he never read a newspaper. He painted both men and
women with sensual delight.
</P>
<P>
   As in ``The Chess Game'' or ``Cashmere,'' both in the Museum of
Fine Arts show, whose models he knew well, he transformed anyone he
loved into gorgeous design. He felt with his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Sargent grew up surrounded by art, not people. His American
parents dragged him (as James' parents dragged their children) from
city to city, through museums and cathedrals. By the time Sargent
was 16, he knew he would be an artist. He had a gift for intimacy.
His portraits and landscapes glimmer with perceptions, as if
Sargent had seized a moment of narrative and painted it trailing
hints of befores and afters.
</P>
<P>
   But Sargent also knew intimately the grand mosaics in Ravenna,
the frescoes of the Sistine Chapel, Last Judgments and Expulsions
from Eden, the Elgin Marbles, Egyptian pharaohs and Assyrian winged
lions.
</P>
<P>
   He measured himself against this art. When Charles McKim, the
architect of the Boston Public Library, asked him to decorate its
third floor, Sargent saw his chance. He worked on the library
murals until 1919. He traveled to Palestine and Egypt _ it was
assumed that the inhabitants had not changed since biblical times _
to sketch figures. He made more than 1,500 studies, many on view
this summer, which trace the passage from private observation to
public decoration.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sargent's design in the library (on view June 7 to July 30;
formal tours of the murals on Saturdays, June 26 through Sept. 25)
comprises a Hebraic End and a Christian End. The Hebraic End is a
fabulous mix of ancient images: bull-bodied Moloch, caged by gilt
spears tipped with hands, Astarte bedecked with glass jewels,
Egyptians oppressing the Hebrews, all surrounded by verses from
Psalm 106. Below this, Moses holds the gilded Ten Commandments; a
Frieze of Prophets surrounds him, each name inscribed in Hebrew.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian End is similarly condensed, a sculptured
Crucifixion (Sargent seems to have made all these himself) with
Adam and Eve catching Christ's blood and all three entwined in the
Serpent; Mary caged by gilt candles and attended by angels and
texts. In between the ends lie Heaven, Hell and the Last Judgment;
Sargent did pages of sketches of chains for the judgment scales.
The ghost of Michelangelo hovers.
</P>
<P>
   The wonderfully appropriate underlying theme must be, as Mary
Crawford Volk, an independent art historian, suggests in the
retrospective's catalog, the Word. The hall is badly lighted, but
Sargent's intensity, his passion for images deconstructed and
recombined, illuminates the design. In this post-modern age, it is
once again beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Sargent went from the library to the museum. Once again, he
designed the entire installation, paintings and sculptures,
requiring major architectural adjustments in the rotunda to
accommodate his cycle of classical myths. He finished in 1925.
Classicism was in the air. Picasso was painting his enormous,
toga-draped women; in that context, Sargent's scenes willfully
ignore the world.
</P>
<P>
   When restoration of the murals began, it was discovered that the
plaster had been painted over during the 1940s, obliterating
Sargent's color scheme and the delicate, painted shading he applied
to bas reliefs and decorative detail. As Carol Troyen, associate
curator of painting at the Museum of Fine Arts, explains, Sargent's
murals make sense as part of a grand decorative scheme, appropriate
to the Beaux-Arts building.
</P>
<P>
   Sargent died on the eve of his departure for Boston to attend
the unveiling of his murals at the Museum of Fine Arts. The next
year, writing on Sargent's memorial exhibition at the Royal Academy
in London, Roger Fry, not for the first time, called Sargent a
fusty, elitist, superficial, postcard-view-painting conservative.
</P>
<P>
   His murals, Fry continued, were especially bad. This attack,
soon taken up in America, still finds echoes today, although
against the evidence of the dazzling, profoundly mysterious and
satisfying beauty of Sargent's paintings, it seems irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   But the large, flat figures of the murals seem antithetical to
the luminosity, grace and plotted spontaneity of Sargent's
watercolors and oils. Viewing them from the restorers' scaffolding
reveals the subtle shading of a cloak, next to dripped paint he
didn't bother to erase. From a distance, both drip and shadow
vanish. There is a sense of detachment about these images; in a
similar way, ``Gassed,'' the huge painting he produced for the
British War Memorials Committee, seems, at first, detached.
</P>
<P>
   Sargent spent four months at the front in 1918, sketching under
his white umbrella (which the Americans camouflaged); he contracted
influenza and was laid up in an army hospital with the wounded; his
niece had been killed by a bomb. He experienced war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gassed,'' 20 feet long, shows a line of blinded soldiers
staggering across a field, moving against an elegiac, golden
sunset. Each grips the shoulder of the man in front. In the
distance, carefree young men play soccer and little airplanes soar
in the serene sky like a flock of birds.
</P>
<P>
   This was a scene Sargent had witnessed. It must have been
horrible. For Sargent, the procession resonated with art: with
Breughel's image of the blind leading the blind, with Rodin's
``Burghers of Calais.'' The soldiers lying on the field in the
foreground sprawl like centurions at Golgotha. That is how Sargent
experienced: through Breughel and Rodin, through art. Knowing these
antecedents, the work changes and gathers power.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of his life, Sargent, the most seductive of artists,
might simply have painted for himself. Like Monet, Sargent knew
that he was considered old-fashioned.
</P>
<P>
   He titled one of the rotunda murals ``Painting, Sculpture and
Architecture Protected From Time by Athena.'' He based the figure
of Architecture, according to Ms. Troyen, on Michelangelo's
``Bruges Madonna.'' Painting, in her classical drapery and
contemporary face, leans against Architecture's sturdy shoulder.
Here were the gods Sargent worshipped. The painting could be his
plea, and his credo.

WATSON RECALLS THE SHOT, OTHER NOTES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TROY PHILLIPS, KEVIN LYONS and J. DOUGLAS FOSTER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
FORT WORTH, Texas _ Tom Watson said he has yet to venture out to
the hole where he made his most memorable shot: the par-4 No. 9.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last year, Watson's off-balance second shot out of the fairway
bunker to within 10 feet for birdie landed him among the event's
shot-making legends.
</P>
<P>
   Watson's 8-iron approach carried into a gust of wind and over
water to the green.
</P>
<P>
   The shot evoked a thunderous roar from the final-day gallery and
carried Watson through the final nine holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's put it this way,'' Watson said. ``I hope I'm not in that
bunker again. I wouldn't want to try to replay that shot. It was
one of the most timely and critical shots I've ever played. It was
a three-shot swing.''
Leonard's spare caddie Having just competed in the GTE Byron Nelson
Classic last weekend, Justin Leonard gave his regular caddie, Bob
Riefke, the day off and employed University of Texas student Blake
Smith during yesterday's shootout. The significance? Smith is the
son of Royal Oaks Country Club head pro Randy Smith, who serves as
Leonard's instructor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always use a different guy on this,'' Leonard said. ``Bob
drove home to Austin for a bit. Blake had a free day and wanted to
come out.''
Feeling comfortable Defending Colonial champion Tom Watson teamed
with Peter Jacobsen yesterday to take third place in the MasterCard
Colonial shootout, which featured an alternate-shot format.
</P>
<P>
   Though it was Watson's tee shot into the sand at No. 17 that
doomed the twosome, Watson said he felt comfortable about defending
his title.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel a little more confident about your play when you won
on the same course the year before,'' Watson said. ``You feel like
you know how to play the golf course. It is just a matter of
getting your golf swing ready to do that.''
Austin north? Had someone unknowingly strolled up to the group in
yesterday's MasterCard Colonial shootout, they might have thought
the University of Texas golf team was practicing.
</P>
<P>
   There were three bags in the event with the UT logo longhorn on
the side. The field of 12 included former Texas stars Mark Brooks,
Bob Estes and Justin Leonard, who won the shootout with Davis Love
III.
Simpson withdraws 1987 U.S. Open champion Scott Simpson withdrew
from the MasterCard Colonial field yesterday, leaving the event
with 112 players.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson has played at Colonial 16 times, his best finish coming
in 1994 when he took second, losing in a playoff to Nick Price.
This marks only the fifth time since 1979 that Simpson hasn't
played at Colonial. nn

SUIT SEEKS DAMAGES FROM FORD IN AMBULANCE BREAKDOWNS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a, f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHELLEY MURPHY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The stories are the same from Boston to the Berkshires
and all the way south to Nantucket: Ford ambulances constantly
breaking down without warning, stranding patients and frustrating
emergency workers.
</P>
<P>
   Now some 100 ambulance companies and municipalities throughout
Massachusetts have banded together to urge a federal judge to
accept their class-action suit against Ford Motor Co., the nation's
largest manufacturer of vehicles built for use as ambulances.
</P>
<P>
   They claim that drive belts on the 1992, 1993 and 1994 Econoline
and F-Series ambulances frequently flew off the vehicles, yet Ford
ignored the problem for years.
</P>
<P>
   They also claim transmissions on the ambulances are defective,
requiring premature and frequent replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time the belt broke when the ambulance was on a highway
and there was a heart-attack patient on board,'' Chris Sampson,
president of the Swansea Ambulance Corp., wrote in a court document
detailing numerous problems with the nonprofit group's 1992 Ford
F350 ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   The breakdown forced the patient to wait by the side of the road
for 15 minutes until another ambulance arrived, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Ford say the company acknowledged a problem with
the accessory drive-belt on some of its ambulances in 1996,
offering to replace the part and reimburse owners for the cost of
repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's lawyers insist there is no evidence of a ``common
defect'' in the ambulances and blame the chronic transmission
problems on ambulance companies for ``failure to properly care for
and repair their vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   But Weston Fire Chief John Thorburn says the department's 1992
Ford Econoline Ambulance is ``the most unreliable ambulance'' he's
seen in his 38 years on the job.
</P>
<P>
   And Boston officials say they finally switched from Ford to
Chevrolet after constant problems and costly repairs to the city's
Ford ambulances.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of small towns, saying they don't have the resources to
take on the Detroit giant, are asking the court to allow them to
sign onto a suit filed against Ford several years ago by three
family-owned ambulance companies _ Professional Ambulance and
Oxygen Service in Cambridge, Action Ambulance Service in Stoneham
and Fallon Service in Milton.
</P>
<P>
   Those companies are seeking hundreds of thousands of dollars in
repair costs, transmission replacements and lost revenue from Ford
in a suit filed in US District Court in Boston that alleges breach
of warranty and unfair and deceptive practices.
</P>
<P>
   During a hearing Monday in Boston before US District Judge
George A. O'Toole Jr., Attorney Lynn E. Parseghian, of the
Washington, D.C. firm of O'Melveny &AMP; Myers, which represents Ford,
argued that a class-action suit would ``create a monster.''
</P>
<P>
   Parseghian said a class-action trial would embroil the court in
a ``morass of individual issues,'' involving hundreds of vehicles
and thousands of complaints.
</P>
<P>
   But Attorney Joanne D'Alcomo, of the Boston law firm of
Schneider, Reilly, Zabin &AMP; Costello, who represents the ambulance
companies, said it would be a burden to force small towns that own
one ambulance to sue Ford individually.
</P>
<P>
   ``We say that Ford knowingly sent out these vehicles, knowing
they were going to break down, knowing patients would be inside,''
D'Alcomo said.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alcomo urged the judge to grant class certification to anyone
who bought a 1992, 1993, or 1994 Ford Econoline or F-Series van,
equipped with an ambulance preparation package, a 7.3-liter diesel
engine and a E40D transmission.
</P>
<P>
   O'Toole has taken the matter under advisement.
</P>
<P>
   Ford is one of just a few manufacturers that builds chassis,
incomplete vans and trucks containing an engine and wheel base,
which are converted to ambulances by independent companies.
</P>
<P>
   The suit focuses on Ford-manufactured parts: a serpentine belt
drive and transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ford acknowledged problems with the serpentine belt in
1996, D'Alcomo said the company knew about them years earlier but
continued to sell ambulances with the defective belts. Ford denies
any common problem with its transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman Fire Chief Timothy P. Travers said the town's only
ambulance, a 1994 Ford Econoline van, had driven only 13,000 miles
when its transmission needed to be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transmission has operated so roughly because of shifting
problems that patients riding in the ambulance complained of
discomfort,'' Travers wrote in court documents.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time that Ford has denied the existence of a problem
in the ambulance transmissions, D'Alcomo said Ford ``leaped into
action'' when a large armored truck company with a fleet of 500
Ford trucks complained about the same transmission.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alcomo said documents show that Ford gave the armored truck
company 10 free transmissions, then split the cost of replacing
other transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the ambulance industry did capture Ford's attention more
than a decade ago. In 1987, Ford recalled 22,000 ambulances to
correct safety-related fuel problems that caused at least two dozen
fires and 15 injuries.

BIRTHPLACE OF TOWN MEETING VOTES IN COUNCIL SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEYMOUTH, Mass. _ Voters in this cradle of direct democracy _
where the town meeting has ruled since the days of the Pilgrims _
are scrapping that folksy form of government practiced continuously
here since 1624.
</P>
<P>
   In an election whose opposing symbols were the quill pen and the
Internet, Weymouth voters have logged on to the digital age, and
will elect its first full-time mayor and an 11-member town council
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're moving on,'' said Wilfred Mathewson, vice chairman of
the Weymouth Historical Commission. ``It's too bad. But, here
again, it's democracy in action. I may not like it, but it's
happened. And we just have to work with it.''
</P>
<P>
   By a wide margin, Weymouth voters on Monday approved a sweeping
rewrite of the town charter that proponents say will mean more
efficient and more accountable government. Opponents argued that it
will leave local government in the handful of a few lawmakers, more
susceptible to outside influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The town meeting gave Weymouth a sense of community that we're
going to lose,'' said Peg Goudy, an opponent of the charter changes
and a member of the board of selectmen. ``I wanted to see changes
in the existing form of government without throwing the baby out
with the bathwater.''
</P>
<P>
   With Monday's vote, Weymouth becomes the 48th Massachusetts
municipality to adopt a city form of government, though it will
officially continue to call itself a town. There are 303 Bay State
communities with either an open or a representative town meeting,
according to the Massachusetts Municipal Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had it for 375 years and now it's history,'' said Frank
Fryer, Weymouth's town clerk for 23 years. ``It's the passing of an
era _ sure.''
</P>
<P>
   That era began, local historians say, in the spring of 1624 when
a ``few hardy souls'' chose local officers and gave themselves the
right to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``They probably were deciding where to bury their dead and where
they were going to plant corn _ that type of thing,'' said
Mathewson.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, in what will be one the last decisions of a Weymouth
town meeting, voters earlier this month appropriated $485,000 for
the purchase of the land where that first meeting is believed to
have been conducted.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial to the archetypal form of New England democracy is
planned for the site near the present-day Sea Street, which in 1624
was part of Wessagusset, the community renamed Weymouth in 1635.
</P>
<P>
   While that folksy, face-to-face government quickly became a
Yankee institution, symbolized in this century by artist Norman
Rockwell's sentimental tribute to citizen-lawmakers, it is
sometimes a cumbersome way of doing business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unstructured with everybody yelling out. There was no
organization to it,'' said Ann Venturo, a five-year Weymouth
resident, who has attended town meetings and Tuesday was watching
her toddler on a swing at a local park. ``Nobody could really talk
or get their point across,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Victor S. DeSantis, associate professor of political science at
Bridgewater State College, said with Weymouth's population at
55,000, its payroll at 1,700 local employees, and its budget
approaching $100 million, change was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problems and the challenges that face government at this
point exceed the average citizen's ability to walk in unprepared
and make multi-million dollar decisions with about five minutes
preparation,'' DeSantis said. ``We're at the point now where this
romanticized version of the volunteer citizen-in-action coming in
after planting season to do these things in the off-season is just
not working.''
</P>
<P>
   The change is the most dramatic for Weymouth since the town
abandoned its open town meeting in 1921 for a representative town
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The drive for revision began more than two years ago, after a
series of financial improprities that led to the conviction of an
office manager in the treasurer-collector's office and a
data-processing official who served a six month sentence for
funneling town funds to a private firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no quaint Norman Rockwell picture that's been painted
in Weymouth over the last 10 years,'' said state Senator Robert L.
Hedlund, a Weymouth Republican and a possible mayoral candidate.
``The problems have been well publicized. The reporting
relationships between the various boards have been dysfunctional.''
</P>
<P>
   Hedlund said he will make a decision soon about whether he'll
seek to become Weymouth's first mayor. William E. Ryan, chairman of
the board of selectmen, said it's likely he'll run.
</P>
<P>
   Weymouth's decision means that John P. Reilly will be the last
in a long line of town-meeting moderators, the official who
controlled _ or tried to control _ debates during often chaotic
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what will be lost will be citizen access,'' said
Reilly, who has reviewed old town-meeting minutes that document
Weymouth's decision to, among other things, send six shillings to
help pay for the soldiers under General George Washington's
command.
</P>
<P>
   ``The town meeting is a piece of history,'' said Reilly,
``that's no longer in existence.''

YUGOSLAVS MAY BE DIGGING UP MASS GRAVES, NATO SAYS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ NATO is examining new clues to try to
determine whether Yugoslav forces may be digging up mass graves and
reburying the bodies to hide evidence of war crimes against Kosovo
Albanians, an allied spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Allied officials are poring over spy satellite photographs to
determine if they show a grave-digging conspiracy or merely
villagers trying to give murdered friends and relatives a proper
burial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are studying detailed intelligence that seems to confirm
that graves have been disturbed,'' an American official said,
referring to sites which NATO presumes are mass graves. ``However,
we have to confirm whether it's a case of someone trying to destroy
evidence or simply a case of an individual reburying a loved one.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the war in Bosnia in 1995, Yugoslav forces there
dug up mass graves in an apparent effort to evade prosecution for
war crimes, a grisly fact of which NATO spokesman Jamie Shea
reminded reporters Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Shea stated that four days ago, Yugoslav troops exhumed 50
ethnic Albanians from a site near a ferrous-nickel factory at
Glogovac. In another mass grave of Albanians killed on April 18
near Lipljan, he said villagers recently were ordered to dig up
bodies and rebury them in individual graves.
</P>
<P>
   When the United States or NATO have most convincingly accused
the forces of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic of mass
executions and mass graves in the past, officials have produced spy
photographs showing freshly disturbed earth. Shea produced no such
photographs Tuesday, but told reporters that his information was
based on more than news accounts or refugee reports. An American
official said Tuesday night that intelligence analysts were
cross-checking satellite photographs with refugee accounts to piece
together what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said there were additional unsubstantiated reports from
refugees of Yugoslav troops reburying bodies from mass graves at
the sites where NATO has bombed and in areas formerly controlled by
Kosovo rebels.
</P>
<P>
   If the accounts prove true, NATO officials and some human rights
advocates said they would signal that Yugoslav authorities fear
being indicted by the U.N. tribunal at The Hague, Netherlands. They
could also be a sign that Milosevic is preparing to accept a
diplomatic settlement to the crisis, and allow an international
peacekeeping force into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said Yugoslav forces were still expelling, and executing,
ethnic Albanians. ``As fast as they try to destroy the old
evidence, new evidence is being created,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking separately to reporters here, David Scheffer, the U.S.
ambassador-at-large for war crimes issues, said conservative
estimates based largely on refugee reports indicate that 5,000
people have been killed in mass executions since the air war
started on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   Scheffer said that 225,000 Kosovar men, between 14 and 59 years
old, were now unaccounted for, twice the estimate that American
officials gave last month. Some may be dead, and some may be hiding
in the hills, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not know what their fate is,'' Scheffer said, adding
that starvation and disease were now widespread among the 550,000
ethnic Albanians who were driven from their homes but who remain in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   From the accounts of refugees who fled to Albania or Macedonia,
Scheffer provided new details on how Yugoslav troops are using
refugees as shields to protect their war operation.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, he said, Yugoslav troops dress in Red Cross
uniforms, cover their vehicles with tarps taken from relief
organizations, and intersperse with refugee convoys. In others, he
said, soldiers have placed refugees in munitions and cement
factories, not necessarily to ward off NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ethnic Albanians reportedly are not being used in a
ostentatious manner to deter attacks, but rather are kept concealed
in NATO target areas apparently in order to generate civilian
casualties that can be blamed on NATO,'' Scheffer said.
</P>
<P>
   Bad weather overnight Monday hampered NATO warplanes, which
conducted 190 bombing raids. Shea announced that 72 F-15s and F-16s
were going to Turkey by month's end, giving NATO the ability to
strike Yugoslavia from all directions.

US SAYS 3 COMPANIES DEFRAUDED INVENTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM F. DOHERTY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- They answered the ads by the thousands, aspiring
inventors with their latest gizmos and gadgets, like an
air-conditioned suit and a fork that tames binge eating.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced that they'd built that better mousetrap, the basement
tinkerers eagerly handed over as much as $11,000 to a Westfield
company that promised an honest appraisal of their bright ideas.
</P>
<P>
   But what they got instead, according to federal officials, was a
package of worthless patenting and marketing services that cost
34,000 people more than $60 million over a 14-year period.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing successful about these companies was the
unparalled size and scope of their scam,'' US Attorney Donald K.
Stern said Tuesday in announcing the indictment of 10 people
involved in the alleged scam. ``The dreams of small inventors were
exploited by this cynical and cruel hoax.''
</P>
<P>
   The indictment for mail fraud followed a four-year investigation
by US Postal inspectors and Internal Revenue Service agents, who
targeted three now-defunct invention promotion companies, two in
western Massachusetts and one in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Stern said one of the companies, American Inventors Corp. of
Westfield, amassed more than $58 million in revenues and another,
American Institute for Reasearch and Development, also of
Westfield, collected $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   From 1982 through 1996, the companies spent millions on
advertising, seeking out inventors on radio and in national
publications such as USA Today, Reader's Digest and TV Guide. Mass
mailings encouraged inventors to call an 800 number to obtain a
free, professional assessment of their ideas.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 alone, AIC mailed out more than 100,000 information
packets to inventors encouraging them to send in their invention
ideas, according to authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Once they'd done so, a salesperson would call and urge the
inventor to pay an initial fee of $169 to $289 to cover the cost of
a patent attorney's opinion letter and a market analysis. If both
were favorable, the inventor would be asked to buy a package of
patenting and marketing services, according to the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   The patent attorney letters were positive ``almost 100 percent
of the time,'' according to authorities, and the marketing analysis
was a ``boilerplate'' report that included no research specific to
a proposed invention. And the market report always concluded that
the invention had sales potential.
</P>
<P>
   Among those defrauded were people whose inventions included a
retractable electrical plug; a night sight for a rifle using a
flashlight, fishing line and tritium; and a bag made of recycled
jeans.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the ``Gastronony Tube Holder,'' the ``Air
Conditioned Suit,'' the ``Thumb Hold Nail Clipper,'' the ``Binge
Buster Fork'' and the ``Hook and Loop Dickey.''
</P>
<P>
   Charged in connection with the scheme were Ronald Boulerice, 60,
of Russell, former owner and president of American Inventors
Corporation; his daughter, Laurie Boulerice, 35, of Easthampton,
former vice-president of American Inventors Corp.; John Samson, 59,
of West Hatfield, former president of American Institute for
Research and Development of Westfield; John Hoime, 49, of
Westfield, Diane Tagliavini, 46, of Westfield, patent attorney Leon
Gilden, 52, formerly of Spokane, Wash.; Jeffrey Rehbein, 33, of
Longmeadow, Scott Favreau, 35, of Springfield, and Ben Abel, 60, of
Brattleboro.
</P>
<P>
   In court Tuesday, Ronald Boulerice was held without bail pending
a detention hearing Wednesday. Authorities were searching in Oregon
for Gilden, the lawyer. The eight other defendants were released on
personal bonds, ranging from $10,000 to $100,000 by US Magistrate
Judge Kenneth P. Neiman.
</P>
<P>
   Gilden, the patent lawyer, allegedly falsely generated and filed
patent applications, some of which altered inventors' ideas without
their permission to avoid having to honor the company's promise of
a money-back guarantee if it could not obtain a patent for the
invention.
</P>
<P>
   Inventors were also falsely told that brochures describing their
inventions were distributed to manufacturers, according to
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The company told inventors that it shared in the financial risk
and made its money by sharing in royalties and through agreements
with manufacturers. In fact, according to prosecutors, its profits
came solely from up-front service fees charged to inventors,
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   In a second indictment, Ronald Boulerice, his daughter, Laurie,
another daughter, Lisa Boulerice, are accused of filing false tax
returns to disguise a payroll kickback scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Boulderice also allegedly created a sham corporation,
Massachusetts Patent Services and set up an invoice scheme which
allowed him to skim $151,000 from the company and give the money to
his daughter Laurie.

DIVIDED PARLIAMENT SHADOWS BARAK VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The morning after winning a landslide victory,
Israeli Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak prayed at Jerusalem's
Western Wall, the spiritual center of Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, he laid a wreath at the grave of former Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin, now a secular shrine to Barak's mentor, who
was assassinated by a Jewish extremist opposed to his vision of
peace.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's visit Tuesday to these two sites symbolized his effort
to move forward on peace and to heal the deep rift between Israel's
secular and religious Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's voting was a mandate for Barak personally, but it
underscored a widening gulf between Israelis who envision a secular
democracy and the ultra-Orthodox who insist on a religious state.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday it was already clear that the bitter divisions will
present the first test of Barak's vows to form a strong coalition
government of unity and change, and could undermine his ability to
run the country effectively if he fails to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Both camps, the secular and the ultra-Orthodox, dramatically
increased their strength in Israel's 120-member parliament. And, at
this moment, each refuses to sit in a government with the other.
</P>
<P>
   The powerful ultra-Orthodox Shas Party, mostly first- and
second-generation North African immigrants, made gains in the
election, increasing its representation in the parliament from 10
seats to 17.
</P>
<P>
   That means Shas has only two seats fewer than the established
Likud Party which was headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
until his, and the party's, defeat Monday. Likud lost more than
one-third of its 32 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Shas party leader, Aryeh Deri, has stunned Israel's
establishment with his success in empowering Israel's Sephardim,
Jewish immigrants from North Africa and Arab states. Deri is a
classic political boss who has provided services for his
constituents, much as James Michael Curley did for Boston's Irish.
And like Curley, he has had trouble with the law.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Deri was sentenced to four years in prison for
corruption, bribery and fraud. He has portrayed himself as a victim
of trumped-up charges from a judicial system controlled by the
elite intent on stopping his effort to help the Sephardic
underclass. Tuesday, he said he would step down from the leadership
of the party to ``reflect on the social and spiritual fiber'' of
the party while he awaits an appeal on his case.
</P>
<P>
   But many saw a deal in the making. Israel's TV and radio news
broadcasts were buzzing Tuesday with the possiblity that Barak may,
now that Deri has stepped down, invite Shas into his coalition,
recognizing that Shas's new power was a force to be reckoned with.
The rumors infuriated the secular left, which worked hard to elect
Barak in large part because of his promise to end the
disproportionate influence of the ultra-Orthodox in Netanyahu's
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will drive the left crazy, but bringing Shas into the
coalition cannot be ruled out,'' said Daniel Ben-Simone, who writes
on ethnic and religious politics for Israel's leading newspaper,
Ha'aretz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barak knows he needs the rabbis to put a blessing on the peace
process, or he will not be able to get it through,'' said
Ben-Simone.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts were dismissive, saying it was a trial balloon by
Barak's camp. Many said they believed Barak was more likely to
bring members of the weakened Likud Party into his coalition to
build unity.
</P>
<P>
   As political analyst Zeev Chafetz put it, ``Deri is the third
rail of Israeli politics; anyone who touches him gets burned. It
just happened to Netanyahu. So Barak would be stupid to bring him
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Another ascendant party is called Change, whose leader Yosef
``Tommy'' Lapid, a veteran journalist, staked out a new ground in
Israeli politics by fashioning a message that was harshly
anti-religious. Not represented in the outgoing Knesset, Change won
six seats in the election.
</P>
<P>
   The far-left party Meretz won nine seats and has also bitterly
opposed the surging influence of the ultra-Orthodox in politics.
The two parties reflected a strong sentiment among secular voters.
</P>
<P>
   Change's Lapid said, ``I want to be minister of justice, there
is too much ultra-Orthodox influence on our justice system. If
Barak invites Shas into the coalition, we will stay in opposition.
. . . We will see it as a betrayal, a deep betrayal.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Michael Melchior, who was elected to a seat in the
parliament on Barak's One Israel list of candidates, stood by Barak
Tuesday at the Western Wall.
</P>
<P>
   Melchior has become an ambassador for Barak's spirit of
inclusion for the religious in the traditionally secular Labor
party. ``One Israel wants to find a new basis for dialogue between
the religious and the secular,'' he said. ``We want to end the
religious arm twisting.''

 &HT;    Accused leader of Florida drug gang captured
 &HT;    By Joshua B. Good
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Investigators say Kenneth ``Boobie'' Williams ruled a
vast drug empire with fear.
</P>
<P>
   Police claim Williams armed members of the Boobie Boys, his gang
of cocaine dealers with AK-47 rifles, which they used to shoot down
rival dealers. In one case they killed a 5-year-old boy and the
boy's mother who were in the car with a rival drug dealer, who was
also killed, according to authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Before his capture Monday in a DeKalb County, Ga. apartment,
Williams, 28, was looking to bring his murderous management style
to Atlanta, said Barry D. Golden, a deputy U.S. marshal from Miami
who spent the last 16 months hunting down Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think part of the reason he moved shop to Atlanta was we had
turned up the heat in Miami. It was too hot for him in Miami,''
Golden said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that heat was America's Most Wanted. The TV show ran
features on Williams five times.
</P>
<P>
   Last week a federal grand jury in Miami indicted Williams, along
with 14 other members of his gang, including a Miami-Dade police
detective. The 13-count indictment lists the murder of the boy and
his family and two other men as part of the Boobie Boys's pattern
of furthering their drug enterprise. Investigators say the Boobie
Boys cocaine network moved $89 million worth of cocaine from the
Bahamas and Panama to Florida, Georgia, W. Virginia, Pennsylvania,
New York, Michigan and Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Williams has not been charged with any of the 35 murders
his group is suspected of carrying out, said Sgt. Tony Monheim, a
supervisor with the Miami-Dade police homicide bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feds are on their regular witch hunt,'' said J. Malik
Abdullah Frederick, a defense attorney who represented Williams
during the suspect's first appearance in federal court in Atlanta
Tuesday. ``There is nothing in the indictment that accuses or even
alleges my client has committed murder.''
</P>
<P>
   But, once he arrives in Florida, where the federal trial is to
be held, detectives plan to obtain additional charges against
Williams in connection with six murders, Monheim said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are six murders where he was the triggerman,'' Monheim
said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams has not been charged with any homicides in Georgia,
either. However, DeKalb police are looking at Williams in
connection with the discovery of a blood-covered car that was left
on I-20 in March. The driver of that car was a Miami drug dealer
who was to meet Williams, said DeKalb County police homicide Sgt.
Weyman Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Police have not found a body. ``All we've got is a bloody car,''
Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Wright said he hopes federal authorities will supply
more information about the I-20 bloody car case now that Williams
is in custody.
</P>
<P>
   DeKalb police say they found two kilograms of cocaine in the
apartment where Williams was arrested Tuesday. In addition to
Williams, police also arrested Zaevon Stevens, 32.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Williams's Boobie Boys gang have been charged in
connection with 13 homicides in Miami, said Miami-Dade Police
homicide Detective Jeff Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Williams's alleged accomplices, Arthur Pless and Ben
Johnson, allegedly used a semiautomatic rifle and handgun to shoot
up the car of Otis Green, a rival drug dealer. That drive-by
slaying happened in Miami on May 17, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Green's car was his girlfriend, Alice Mae Gardner, and
her son, Michael Frazier, a 5-year-old. All three died. A fourth
person in the car survived, Monheim said.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives had tried to link Williams to another massacre, this
one in Georgia, Lewis said. On Jan. 30, 1998, in Walthourville,
Georgia, south of Savannah, six people died in a backwoods crack
house. They were shot and stabbed. A seventh was found shot to
death on the nearby Fort Stewart Army reservation.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the seven victims were from Liberty City, a neighborhood
in Miami where the Boobie Boys sold crack cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   But Lewis said investigators were not able to link Williams to
those slayings.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was charged with a murder in Miami in 1988. That charge
was reduced to dangerous act and Williams spent one year in prison,
Golden said.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 23) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Matt Wolf is the London theater critic for Variety and a regular
writer on the arts from London.  
 By MATT WOLF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Ayub Khan-Din grew up in the north of England in
suburban Manchester, the eighth of 10 children born to an English
mother and an emigre father from Pakistan, who between them ran a
fish-and-chips shop.
</P>
<P>
   The nearest sibling in the lineup above him was nearly four
years older, while three years separated Khan-Din from his next
brother down the row. And so, recalled the writer and actor, who is
now 37: ``I wasn't part of the older kids or the younger kids. I
lived in my own world and spent a lot of time daydreaming. It paid
off in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   For proof, one need look no further than ``East Is East,''
Khan-Din's bittersweet, semi-autobiographical comedy about growing
up in the early 1970s in a mixed-race Anglo-Asian household, where
there were often as many as four children to a bed and the toilet
was outdoors. (Khan-Din did not have a bed to himself until he was
9.)
</P>
<P>
   ``East Is East'' was acclaimed when it opened two years ago in
London at the Royal Court Theater. On Tuesday, the play opens at
the Manhattan Theater Club as a co-production between that Off
Broadway company and the New Group.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Elliott, artistic chief of the New Group, directs a cast
headed by Jenny Sterlin as Ella Khan, the feisty mother of six (a
seventh child is referred to as having gone off to live on his
own), and Edward A. Hajj as Ella's husband, George, the prideful
father who has left a first wife in Pakistan and still clings,
sometimes ferociously, to the customs of his native country.
</P>
<P>
   The play, Khan-Din's first, which he began almost 15 years ago
as something to do when he wasn't working as an actor, has won
various awards, including best West End play from the Writers'
Guild of Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
   A funny and moving low-budget film version was screened May 14
in the Directors' Fortnight section of the current Cannes Film
Festival and will be distributed by Miramax in the United States
later this year. The director, Damien O'Donnell, is a first-time
filmmaker; Linda Bassett, the play's original Ella, once again
heads the cast.
</P>
<P>
   At the time he wrote the play, Khan-Din was not long out of the
Mountview drama school in London. His mother had recently died of
Alzheimer's disease and, he said: ``I wanted a kind of memorial.
Which started me thinking about the problems we had gone through
and the area that we all grew up in'' _ working-class Salford,
where his was virtually the only Asian family. (Khan-Din's father
died in 1990 at the age of 84.)
</P>
<P>
   But whereas some memory plays (think Tennessee Williams and
Eugene O'Neill, for starters) are etched in acid and tears,
Khan-Din's mixes in compassion for a family confronting such
culturally divisive issues as arranged marriages, a son's desire to
become an artist and the circumcision of the youngest boy, Sajit,
who is as close as the play gets to a stand-in for the author.
</P>
<P>
   ``The anger is there,'' said Khan-Din, an amiable
conversationalist who is stockier now than in his leading-man days
as the pleasure-loving accountant, Sammy, in ``Sammy and Rosie Get
Laid,'' Stephen Frears' 1987 film. ``But you can get your message
across much stronger, I think, through humor and showing humanity.
That's the only way an audience is going to come in. And if you're
not going to get an audience, at the end of the day, your play is a
dead duck.''
</P>
<P>
   Ian Rickson, the artistic director of the Royal Court, which was
a co-producer of ``East Is East'' with the Birmingham Repertory
Theater and the Asian theater company Tamasha, praised ``the
wonderful, chaotic human energy'' of the play.
</P>
<P>
   Khan-Din, Rickson said, ``is an innate dramatist.'' So it is no
surprise to hear that the writer is preparing two more plays for
the Court. The first, ``Last Dance at Dum Dum,'' a commercial
co-venture, starts performances on the West End on July 8.
</P>
<P>
   Sudha Bhuchar, a former actress who co-founded Tamasha 10 years
ago, was responsible for encouraging Khan-Din to pull ``East Is
East'' out of a drawer and submit it to the series of workshops and
drafts that eventually led to a full production.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Ayub was really reluctant at first,'' Ms. Bhuchar recalled.
But, she said of the play, ``I feel in a sense it transcends race;
it's about people more than anything.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Khan-Din believes the current climate for Asian work
``represents quite a change.'' Notwithstanding Hanif Kureishi's
highly regarded screenplay for the 1985 ``My Beautiful
Laundrette,'' Khan-Din said, a decade or so ago ``the only thing
you ever saw about Asians was always about the girl who didn't want
to get married, and I was usually the guy she didn't want to get
married to.''
</P>
<P>
   Khan-Din is also at work on the other Royal Court commission,
entitled ``So Soon, So Soon,'' and an original screenplay,
``Belmondo Sahib,'' a romantic comedy set in London and Paris.
</P>
<P>
   So busy is he as a writer that this onetime soap opera star has
set up a production company called Raboon Pictures with Buki
Armstrong, his Anglo-Nigerian girlfriend and business partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Writing gives me the thrill that I used to get when I first
started acting,'' Khan-Din said.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, ``East Is East'' marks a first collaboration
between the long-established Manhattan Theater Club and the New
Group, a relatively recent addition to the city's theatrical scene.
The New Group has had its greatest successes with two plays
(``Ecstasy'' in 1995 and ``Goose-Pimples'' in 1997) by the English
writer Mike Leigh. Elliott chose and directed both.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievably original,'' Elliott said about ``East Is
East'' by telephone from New York. ``When you read it, you think,
`What is this?' And then you find out most of it is true, so that
really increases your interest. You just know where this play is
coming from _ the warmth and heart and love and rage that are in
this family.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott added that his company's success with British plays _
Stephen Bill's ``Curtains'' in 1996 included _ had happened more by
default than by design. ``When you do something a couple of
times,'' said the director, who is 36, ``and people like it, then
you start getting sent all these British plays _ and they are
good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The attitude toward theater writing is so different over
there,'' he said. ``They still take it seriously, where our young
writers are making the transition to television and film.'' (So,
for that matter, is Elliott, who has directed his first movie, an
independent film entitled ``A Map of the World,'' for release later
this year. Based on the Jane Hamilton novel of the same name, it
stars Sigourney Weaver and Julianne Moore.)
</P>
<P>
   With ``East Is East,'' the Manhattan Theater Club may benefit
from some of the freshness and energy that have characterized the
New Group over its six years at a time when the older organization
is confronting _ and hardly uniquely _ a graying subscription
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody here at MTC and everybody in New York is aware of
the problem of subscription audiences,'' said Lynne Meadow, the
artistic director of the Manhattan Theater Club. She said she had
been talking to other smaller companies, like the Drama Dept. and
the Atlantic Theater Company, about similar partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   ``When dealing with some of the newer groups,'' Ms. Meadow said,
``there is a support we can give that is special for them, and a
vitality, for example that Scott has, that is great for us. It's a
wonderful mixture.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Coke promotes its ``secret formula'' for achieving uniformity of
taste from Tulsa to Timbuktu. Pepsi scoffs, saying its product is
just plain better and boasting that its market appeal gives it a
big advantage over its archrival.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing new in any of that _ except that the soft-drink giants
are both talking about orange juice.
</P>
<P>
   After Pepsico bought Tropicana from Seagram Co. last July for
$3.3 billion, the spillover of the cola wars to America's breakfast
tables was inevitable. Coca-Cola Co. has owned Minute Maid, the
nation's No. 2 juice maker, for more than 35 years, and now the two
companies have a new testing ground for their marketing arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts wonder whether the companies are indulging in
overkill. Tropicana and Minute Maid are spending heavily to blast
consumers with advertisements and promotions and are sniping at
each other in the best Coke-Pepsi tradition. In February, Minute
Maid trumpeted growing sales of its Minute Maid Premium even as
``the Tropicana Season's Best line registered the largest decline
in sales _ down nearly 32 percent _ of all value brands.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, Tropicana has issued news releases comparing
the taste of juices made from concentrates unfavorably with its
``natural'' brands.
</P>
<P>
   All this, skeptics ask, for a market that is essentially
stagnant? Indeed, the juice market, at about $3 billion last year,
represents only a small corner of the companies' beverage empires _
a small and highly volatile corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's very little synergy in terms of the economics,'' said
Jennifer Solomon, a beverage analyst for Salomon Smith Barney and
one of the early doubters about the wisdom of the Tropicana
acquisition. ``Pepsi now has to deal with refrigerated rail cars
and perishable products. It's a whole level of complexity that you
don't have in the soft-drink business.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Tropicana-Minute Maid clash makes for one of the more
interesting side battles of the cola wars; Pepsi's purchase of
Tropicana may have forced Coke to hold onto Minute Maid against its
will, for example. And with orange juice, the tables are turned:
Pepsi, the perennial No. 2 to Coke, has the best-selling brand for
a change.
</P>
<P>
   Coke and Pepsi argue that orange juice is a crucial element of
their respective corporate strategies. And since both beverage
giants are using the same basic techniques to sell orange juice
that they use to market cola, any sudden reversals of fortune for
Minute Maid or Tropicana could act as an early warning sign for the
future for their other brands.
</P>
<P>
   As does Coke, Minute Maid wants to convince consumers that no
matter where they go, it will always give them the same familiar
flavor. That is because both products are distributed as
concentrate to all points of the globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the hallmarks of a brand is consistency,'' said Ralph
Cooper, Minute Maid's president and a former Coca-Cola president in
Europe. ``What we are trying to do with Minute Maid is make the
taste the same everywhere. That was a conscious decision we made
related to the brand building we are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Minute Maid, based in Houston, adopted its concentrate-only
policy in 1996 as part of an image overhaul that included the
change of its name from Coca-Cola Foods. Along with a new package
and a new name, the company also contended that it had come up with
a formula to reproduce the taste of ``biting into a fresh, ripe
orange.''
</P>
<P>
   This was achieved, it said, through careful mixing of the orange
juice, along with other ``parts of the orange,'' that it buys from
the United States, Brazil and other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bit of secret formula,'' said Joe Scalzo, Minute Maid's
marketing director, evoking the heart and soul of Coca-Cola, which
still will not reveal how its cola is made. ``The way we process
orange juice gives us the ability to tweak the formulation such
that you can naturally enhance some of the taste aspects of the
product.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking a jab at Tropicana, Scalzo said consumers do not give a
hoot how a product is made as long as it tastes good. ``Our
competition's approach is that they squeeze the orange juice during
the season and then store it, either in tanks in Florida or frozen
in big blocks,'' he said derisively. ``We process the juice the
same way, year round. They are forced to vary the process based on
the season.''
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the reconfiguration of Minute Maid mimics the model
at Coca-Cola: Make a product that can be shipped worldwide, make
people aware of your brand and drive demand for it through
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Tropicana, of course, says Minute Maid's strategy is all wet, or
rather, not wet enough. To the Pepsico unit, it seems self-evident
that consumers will prefer juice that is packaged just as it was
squeezed out of the orange. And there is no longer any question
that it can promote its not-from-concentrate juice as a premium
brand or that consumers will pay another 10 cents a quart for it.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Tropicana is the Michael Jordan of orange juice,'' said
Emanuel Goldman, a global consumer-products analyst for Merrill
Lynch. ``That's why Pepsi bought it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tropicana's real competitive advantage might be its parent
company's extensive delivery networks. Pepsico plans to put
Tropicana products in places they are not in right now _ like
additional convenience stores, airports and food-service companies.
The company just introduced a 20-ounce Tropicana container, hoping
to prod higher consumption with the large single-serving package.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, Pepsico wants to weld Tropicana with the other two
components of its packaged-food empire: soft drinks and Frito-Lay
snack foods. Pepsi senior managers, who have begun sitting in on
strategy meetings at Tropicana's Bradenton, Fla., headquarters,
believe the combination of the three lines creates a marketing
appeal to both consumers and retailers that it calls ``the power of
one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this is Pepsico's most important strategic
initiative,'' Ms. Solomon of Salomon Smith Barney wrote in a recent
report. ``In test markets, Pepsico has found that Pepsi/Frito sales
aisles have resulted in 30 percent sales increases.'' At a recent
food show in Chicago, Pepsi displayed combined soft drinks and
snacks in various formats, clearly indicating this was the future.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter of this year, Tropicana's sales grew $15
million, or about 3 percent, from a year earlier, to $499 million,
and its profits rose 29 percent, to $35 million, from $27 million
in 1998. ``Tropicana frankly had a terrific quarter,'' Pepsico's
chief financial officer, Michael D. White, told analysts in a
conference call. ``We have seen the benefit of the shift to Pure
Premium and the reduction of our overhead costs.''
</P>
<P>
   The news at Minute Maid was even better: sales grew by 5 percent
over the same period, and the company turned in the best showing of
any Coca-Cola unit in a quarter when Coke's volume worldwide
declined by 1 percent. Minute Maid does about $2 billion in sales
annually, which includes products other than orange juice.
</P>
<P>
   For all the impressive results at both companies, and for all
their portrayal of their products as thirst-quenchers supreme,
demand for orange juice remains lackluster. Only one in five
Americans drinks it for breakfast. And both Tropicana and Minute
Maid constitute tiny fractions of their parent company's total
revenues: $22.3 billion at Pepsico; $18.8 billion at Coke.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've learned that it's in the refrigerator,'' Minute Maid's
Scalzo said, sounding a little frustrated. ``How do we get them to
bring it out?''
</P>
<P>
   It is not just Coke that feels his pain. Tropicana does, too.
``The big challenge, is to get that segment of the population that
is not starting their day with orange juice,'' said Brian Cornell,
until recently Tropicana's senior vice president for sales and
marketing and now president for Europe and Canada, ``and, two, to
get them to continue to drink orange juice on a regular basis.''
</P>
<P>
   The way to do this, both juice makers believe, is add more
products. With its eye on young families, Minute Maid has begun
packaging calcium-fortified juice in single-serving boxes for
snacks and lunch boxes and is marketing new flavor mixes, also with
added calcium. It has introduced an orange-passion fruit juice,
Scalzo said, with ``a more sophisticated taste'' that is supposed
to appeal particularly to older women.
</P>
<P>
   Tropicana is leaning heavily on the calcium-added concept, with
calcium-enhanced grapefruit juice as well as orange. There is also
an orange juice with extra vitamin C, vitamin E and other
additives. Marketing messages include comparisons between orange
juice and bananas. ``Few people recognize that a glass of orange
juice has as much potassium as a banana,'' declares Cornell, the
sales chief. And another thing: bananas may not be available in
your local vending machine. Tropicana ads, with their ``Perfect''
slogan, are targeting, among others, older women, whose worries
about losing bone-mass because of menopause tend to be more urgent
than those of other groups. Other ads focus on men and children.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even if orange juice is fortified to the point that it
packs all the wallop of an energy bar, consumers have dozens of
other choices for a breakfast drink or midday pick-me-up, from
competing juice blends to endless varieties of teas and coffees.
Not to mention colas.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to be able to sell orange juice like you sell
Pepsi _ price it low and stack it high,'' said Kevin Murphy, the
chief operating officer for Ocean Spray, which has sued Pepsi, its
distribution partner, over the Tropicana acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not impossible to give old products a fin de siecle
spark. ``Look at milk,'' said Bob Vosburgh, who follows the
business for Supermarket News, a trade publication. ``There's a
whole new aura for milk with these resealable single-serve jugs
that were introduced by one of the big dairies. It's helped
rejuvenate the whole milk category, even though it's the same thing
in a new package.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether orange juice can pull off the same feat is unclear.
``Everyone always points to what Quaker did with Snapple,''
Vosburgh said, referring to the cereal giant's purchase of Snapple
for $1.7 billion and subsequent, humiliating sale of the beverage
maker for $300 million. ``What happens with Coke and Pepsi and
orange juice remains to be seen.'' &QL;

A MULTIPLEX OF A MUSEUM TURNS ON THE LIGHTS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 23) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Ann Wilson Lloyd's most recent article for Arts and Leisure was on
the artist Teresita Fernandez.  
 By ANN WILSON LLOYD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH ADAMS, Mass. _ The Visavox was a proto-television device
developed here in the 1920s by the electronics wizard Frank
Sprague, founder of the Sprague Electric Co.
</P>
<P>
   The appliance was more accurately a personal cinema,
synchronizing sound and image for the first time, but awkwardly
requiring you to stick your head up inside a box. Among Sprague's
more successful products before the plant closed in 1986 were
capacitors that enable radio, television and other appliances to
spring to life at the flip of a switch.
</P>
<P>
   This electronic trivia is relevant for the way it meshes with a
new installation to be introduced here next Sunday by the video
artist Tony Oursler. Titled ``Optics'' and aimed at investigating
the origins of sound and light media, Oursler's new work was
commissioned by the Williams College Museum of Art in nearby
Williamstown and the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art,
called colloquially Mass MOCA, which is what the sprawling, former
Sprague plant has become.
</P>
<P>
   Oursler's work will have its premiere as part of Mass MOCA's
long awaited opening, also next Sunday. After more than a decade of
honing a workable formula, the institution _ five huge,
19th-century mill buildings out of 27 available at the site _ will
become the Northeast's newest, and the nation's largest,
contemporary museum and high-tech performance center.
</P>
<P>
   It will have a black-box theater that seats 650, an outdoor
cinema and courtyards filled with artists' installations and sound
works. Joseph Thompson, Mass MOCA's director, calls the place a
cultural laboratory. His ambitious, multifaceted concept would
probably do Frank Sprague proud.
</P>
<P>
   It was serendipitous timing that Oursler was chosen to help
inaugurate Mass MOCA, said Deborah Rothschild, the curator of the
Williams College Museum, where Oursler's midcareer traveling survey
is on view though Oct. 24. ``We were looking for a way to
collaborate with Mass MOCA and also for a way to allow Tony to make
new work,'' Ms. Rothschild said. ``His work is appealing on many
levels; it's lively and actively involves the audience. We thought
it would fit Mass MOCA's combined purposes well.''
</P>
<P>
   Oursler calls ``Optics'' his audiovisual treatise on a spectrum
of phenomena _ mythology, the origins of science, early distrust of
theatrical entertainments and the mysteries of sound and light.
``All these came together for me in this installation,'' he said.
``I wanted to create a loose chain of optics, mimicking, for
instance, how TV takes light and turns it into electricity, and
then into a coded signal, which is then represented to the viewer
who decodes it again culturally.''
</P>
<P>
   Though not finished as of this writing, Oursler's new work
promises to be a departure from what his audience knows best:
projections of hectoring, neurotic characters onto puppets and rag
dolls; whining, talking heads and disembodied blinking eyeballs
that simulate a psycho ward of sadly funny misfits. About two dozen
of these characteristic pieces are on view at the Williams College
Museum exhibition, where some of his earliest television
installations have also been reconstructed, revealing, in their
haphazard quirkiness, the roots of Oursler's obsessions.
</P>
<P>
   If Oursler has pulled back from television specifically, and
from examining our complicities with the electronic personas that
demonically invade our lives, his refocus on proto-media has
flushed devils out of the historical details. Part of his
installation at Mass MOCA will feature small glass Lucifers lurking
around various lighting devices and drawing attention to the odd
behavior of light.
</P>
<P>
   One little devil appears to be crawling into a utility lamp,
mischievously leading one's eye into the glare. Viewed indirectly,
the light seems to pop out the tip of his tail.
</P>
<P>
   Devils cropped up everywhere when Oursler researched early sound
and light experiments, he said. Part of his installation will
include a homemade camera obscura with a hand-ground lens. Through
it, people are rendered as small, fuzzy, moving figures that, apart
from being upside down, are akin to early television figures.
</P>
<P>
   The history of the camera obscura, traceable to the 13th
century, depicts engravings of cavorting devils in the imagery,
Oursler said: ``Somehow they connected devils with the lens
transparency. To me, that connects to Lucifer as light, and the
battle we've had with media that goes on to this day.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by early films in which moral dilemmas are often
portrayed by devils wrestling angels, he is shooting a video of two
costumed friends battling it out amid puffs of smoke and other
primitive theatrics. Other segments of Oursler's installation will
include a new video projection in which a camera interacts with
aberrant light that causes auras or coronas around figures, effects
that filmmakers try to eliminate.
</P>
<P>
   Oursler plans to remove the figures and keep the
mystical-looking flares. A digitally animated video of morphing
imagery, to be projected on arranged objects, is also under
development. ``It will be a frieze based on a kind of meta-history
of technology, almost a WPA mural based on sensory research,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The video was made in collaboration with the digital-animation
firm Kleiser-Walczak Construction Co., one of Mass MOCA's newly
installed commercial tenants, and another reason the Williams
College Museum wanted Oursler to be able to develop new work at
Mass MOCA.

YUGOSLAVS OFFER TO TALK KOSOVO SETTLEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN AND CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE _ As two captured Yugoslav soldiers were handed over to
Serb authorities Tuesday without fanfare, a senior Yugoslav
diplomat here said Yugoslavia was prepared to negotiate a
settlement to the conflict over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO officials charged that that Yugoslav authorities are
digging up mass graves of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo in a
systematic effort to destroy evidence that could be used against
them in war crimes trials. The officials emphasized that NATO's
goal is Serb capitulation, not negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the diplomatic efforts to end the fighting are
heating up on many fronts. In Belgrade, Foreign Ministry spokesman
Nebojsa Vujovic, the former charge d'affaires of the Yugoslav
embassy in Washington, made some of the most conciliatory comments
in weeks, telling reporters here that his country was ready to
negotiate an end to the fighting as long as it respected
Yugoslavia's ``territorial integrity,'' meaning that Kosovo
province, 90 percent of whose residents are ethnic Albanians, would
remain part of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Vujovic also insisted that after nearly two months of bombing,
Yugoslavia had emerged as the moral victor in what has become a
bloody standoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could a nation of 11 million be a loser when the
mightiest, the most developed countries in the world and the
mightiest military alliance is conducting a high-tech war for
almost two months?'' he asked. Vujovic said Yugoslavia considered a
basis for negotiations to be the peace plan put forward by the
Group of Eight nations, the subject of intense diplomatic efforts
in Bonn and Helsinki Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   However, in Washington, a State Department official said that
the United States and its NATO allies ``don't envision a
negotiation. We demand acceptance'' of the alliance's oft-stated
conditions for ending the conflict, which include creation of an
environment in which about 900,000 refugees who have fled Kosovo to
escape either Serb persecutions of NATO bombs can return.
</P>
<P>
   ``Negotiation means compromise, watering down, `you give me
this, I give you that.' We are not going to negotiate,'' the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   The key issue in any resolution is the presence of a
substantial, NATO-dominated military group in a Kosovo emptied of
Yugoslav-Serb forces. There has been no hint from the Yugoslav side
that it would accept such a military presence, while the NATO side
says that, without it, the refugees will not feel secure enough to
return.
</P>
<P>
   However, German, Italian, and Russian leaders Tuesday floated
various ideas for a bombing pause, and Finnish President Martti
Ahtisaari gaining stature as a possible broker of understanding
among Russians, Americans, Yugoslavs.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the Group of Eight _ seven rich industrial
nations, plus Russia _ are meeting in Bonn Wednesday as part of an
effort to forge a United Nations Security Council resolution which
could be the outline for an end to the conflict over Kosovo. The
State Department official said Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott, who has been meeting with Ahtisaari and Russian special
envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin in Helsinki for the same purpose, may
also be in Bonn Wednesday to brief the G-8 representatives of those
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James Foley said NATO officials have
been ``reading signs coming out of Belgrade for several weeks now''
indicting that growing numbers of political and military leaders
there believe President Slobodan Milosevic should accept the
alliance's conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see these as signs that, indeed, the NATO air campaign is
working,'' he said. ``The diplomatic solution can come quickly'' is
Milosevic is willing to do that.
</P>
<P>
   In other developments Tuesday, the 56th day of fighting:
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said the vaunted Apache attack helicopters
that were to have added a unique punch to NATO's air campaign are
unlikely to see combat over Kosovo anytime soon. The risk to pilots
is simply too great, he suggested, and when the weather is good the
job can be done just as well with A-10 jets. The Pentagon
dispatched more of the A-10s to the region.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking with reporters during a photo session in the Oval
Office, Clinton declined to rule out the use of ground troops in
Kosovo combat. ``I think the air war has accomplished quite a bit
and there's a lot more that it can accomplish,'' Clinton said. ``I
and everyone else has always said that we intend to see our
objectives achieved, and that we have not and will not take any
option off the table.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials in Brussels of trying to cover up evidence of
massacres of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo by ordering villagers to
dig up mass graves and bury the bodies separately. David Scheffer,
a US ambassador-at-large for war crimes, also said there is
increasing evidence that Serbs have used ethnic Albanians during
the conflict as human shields. Military sources predicted that
Milosevic might soon declare a cease-fire in hope of winning a
bombing pause, but they said NATO would dismiss such a move as a
trick.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's diplomatic activity occurred against the backdrop of a
subdued prisoner release. Two Yugoslav soldiers who were captured
in separate incidents last month by the rebel Kosovo Liberation
Army were released to Yugoslav authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The prisoners, who were passed by the KLA to the Albanian
government and eventually to the US Army, had been held at the US
base at Mannheim, Germany. They were moved Tuesday to Budapest, the
Hungarian capital, where they were turned over to officials from
the International Committee of the Red Cross. They were then driven
by Red Cross officials to the Yugoslav border.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at Roeszke, the Hungarian side of the border crossing
where the soliders were handed over to Yugoslav authorities, Red
Cross spokeswoman Nadya Kebir said the two soldiers appeared to
have been well-treated during their detention. They were named as
Boban Milen Kovic and Sesko Tairovic, both privates.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were in good condition,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said Red Cross officials interviewed the two soldiers
Tuesday ``to make sure they really wanted to go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, when Defense Secretary William Cohen first
disclosed that President Clinton had asked him to review releasing
the two Yugoslav soldiers, some US officials had said that one of
the soldiers was reluctant to return to Yugoslavia, apparently
because his Albanian captors had videotaped him accusing fellow
soldiers of engaging in summary executions and the rape of
refugees. The propaganda tape was released to Western news outlets,
including the BBC.
</P>
<P>
   Kebir sidestepped questions about one of the soldier's supposed
reservations, saying only that Red Cross officials were convinced
that the two soldiers genuinely wanted to return to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the attention paid here by the
government-controlled media to the release more than three weeks
ago of three US soldiers who had been captured while on patrol
along the Macedonia-Serbia border, Tuesday's release of the
Yugoslav soldiers barely merited a mention on Serbian television
Tuesday night. US officials, meanwhile, insisted that the release
of the two Yugoslav soldiers was not a quid pro quo for the release
of the US servicemen, which was organized by Rev. Jesse Jackson.

 NORTH ADAMS, Mass.: Mass MOCA.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kleiser-Walczak, formerly based in California, produced the
special effects for the 3-D opera ``Monsters of Grace,'' by Philip
Glass and Robert Wilson, which will be presented at Mass MOCA on
July 17. (The full summer programming is available on the Internet
at www.massmoca.org.)
</P>
<P>
   Down the vast hallways from Oursler's new piece are newly
installed monumental works, few of them ever likely to fit into
conventional museums. Robert Rauschenberg's marathon painting,
``1/4 Mile or 2 Furlong Piece'' (1984-1999), lent by the artist,
has its own gallery the length of a football field. Large, rarely
seen works by John Chamberlain, Joseph Beuys, Bruce Nauman, James
Rosenquist, Mario Merz, Dan Flavin and Carl Andre, are also on loan
for various tenures from several institutions.
</P>
<P>
   These galleries represent what remains of Mass MOCA's original
plan to be a home for oversize contemporary art that Thomas Krens
envisioned here back in 1985. Krens, who became director of the
Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, headed the Williams College Museum of
Art at the time.
</P>
<P>
   As Mass MOCA's mission evolved over the years, the Guggenheim's
role gradually diminished. It is now simply one of several lenders
of large artworks, said Thompson, who is also an alumnus of the
Williams College Museum.
</P>
<P>
   These rooms, large enough to swallow up art leviathans, are
themselves a grand spectacle finessed back from near ruin by the
architectural firm Bruner/Cott &AMP; Associates of Cambridge, Mass.
Practicing minimal intervention, their efforts, in one vast
gallery, include a center row of old wooden support posts chopped
into stubs left hanging from the ceiling like a spine.
</P>
<P>
   These are spanned by interlacing steel cables creating a
graceful trussed ceiling. Throughout, a century-old patina of paint
and fugitive markings denote former rooms, floor levels, doors and
windows that bear elegant witness to the past. If romance can be
mined from America's industrial age, the mother lode is here.
</P>
<P>
   Around 100,000 square feet of space will eventually be leased to
compatible commercial tenants, like Kleiser-Walczak, generating up
to $1.2 million a year, Thompson said, to offset operating costs.
Revenues from the performances will help, though the cultural
economy here is seasonal, and Mass MOCA's avant-garde programming
unproven as a draw.
</P>
<P>
   Additional visual art that Thompson has commissioned for Mass
MOCA is, like Oursler's, in keeping with the museum's revised
mission as a place for experimental new media and
cross-disciplinary investigations. ``Ghost Catching,'' a video
installation of images of the dancer Bill T. Jones digitally
multiplied into an ensemble is a prime example.
</P>
<P>
   Others are off site and temporary, like billboards by Sue Coe,
Gary Simmons and Leon Golub, placed along nearby highways; some
will become part of Mass MOCA's somewhat ephemeral collection.
</P>
<P>
   These include two sound pieces from previous exhibitions that
already exist and a new work, ``Music for a Quarry,'' by Walter
Fahndrich, in an abandoned marble works outside town. Others are
``The Visitations,'' an installation by Ron Kuivila in an
unrenovated building that was left with dropped tools and rusting
equipment still in place, and ``Tree Logic,'' a large outdoor piece
by Natalie Jeremijenko sure to make arborists cringe. Six trees
have been strung up in high rigging, roots skyward in containers,
where they are expected to pit gravity against phototropic forces.
</P>
<P>
   Back up in Oursler's galleries, he tells the tale of the
so-called ``lightning room'' during Sprague's occupation of the
site. It was where electronic components were jolted by
thunderbolts to see how they stood up. Residents of North Adams
recall seeing flashes through the lightning room's glass-block wall
as they drove past, invoking a mad-scientist scenario that the
artist relishes. ``This was a room I couldn't refuse,'' Oursler
says.

GTE SHAREHOLDER APPROVE MERGER WITH BELL ATLANTIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GTE Corp. shareholders on Tuesday approved the $52.9 billion
merger with Bell Atlantic Corp., even as a $37 billion merger
agreement announced Monday between U S West Inc. and Global
Crossing Ltd. helped define the regulatory challenges to the Bells'
ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Like U S West, Bell Atlantic and GTE are trying to become one of
the handful of global titans that are expected to dominate the
communications industry in just a few years. A combined Bell
Atlantic-GTE would control about a third of the U.S. local phone
industry and would have major Internet and wireless phone units as
well as a burgeoning long-distance voice business.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game is about having four or five or six major global
players that compete against each other and hold each other at
bay,'' said GTE chairman Charles Lee. ``That's what the world
needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the GTE votes that were cast, 96.7 percent favored the
merger. But because many shares were not voted, only about 76
percent of the total shares outstanding were voted in favor,
exceeding the two-thirds required to approve the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic shareholders are scheduled to vote Wednesday.
Assuming that they approve the deal, the main hurdle still facing
it would be review by the Federal Communications Commission. The
Justice Department has already approved it, subject to the sale of
some wireless businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC will consider at least two major issues. The first is
that GTE has about 100,000 long-distance customers in Bell
Atlantic's region, and Bell Atlantic is now barred from selling
long-distance service in that territory. But the U S West-Global
Crossing deal demonstrated that many people in the communications
industry believe such small overlaps can be finessed, perhaps by
simply selling those customers to another carrier.
</P>
<P>
   The second, and more serious, issue is that GTE, through its BBN
subsidiary, runs one of the nation's most extensive data
communications networks. Bell Atlantic is prohibited from selling
long-distance data communications. Though GTE's overlapping
long-distance voice customers could be peeled off relatively easily
_ they are concentrated in Pennsylvania and Virginia _ the BBN data
operation does business throughout Bell Atlantic's territory.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic chairman Ivan Seidenberg would not say how he
intended to solve that problem if Bell Atlantic could not get quick
long-distance approval. But in a deft New York sports reference, he
said his company would not stop fighting to keep all parts of GTE.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like Allan Houston, you've got to play the whole game,''
he said in an interview, referring to the New York Knicks guard who
played poorly for much of the contest but then made the
game-winning shot Sunday night against the Miami Heat in a critical
basketball playoff game.

 &HT;    Man shot on interstate dies at hospital
 &HT;    By Will Anderson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMYRNA, Ga. _ Noe Soto Diaz was found unconscious inside his
wrecked car on Interstate 75 early Tuesday, shot once in the face
and once in the chest. He died at 4:05 a.m. after being taken to
Grady Memorial Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Police called for the public's help in locating a gold or
cream-colored vehicle, possibly a compact car.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators think the victim's bullet-riddled 1993 black Honda
Civic scraped the vehicle before it swerved onto the shoulder of
the southbound lanes near Windy Hill Road and struck a retaining
wall around 1 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some physical evidence to indicate there could have
been a collision,'' said Cobb County police Lt. George Hatfield,
who is in charge of the department's traffic enforcement unit.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb County police will be camped along I-75 again today _ after
the morning rush hour _ to reconstruct what they think happened.
They will be relying on measurements marked with spray paint on
Tuesday, as well as using a computer program that provides a model
of how the wreck may have occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives Tuesday night still did not know if the shooting was
a random act of violence, a case of extreme road rage or a vendetta
carried out against the young Hispanic driver.
</P>
<P>
   More than 12 hours after the accident scene caused gridlock on
the interstate, police located a cousin of Diaz who identified him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were more than two forms of identification with
different names on them, in addition to the registration of the
car,'' said Cobb police spokesman Dana Pierce. ``He did not own the
car, and the car was not reported stolen.''
</P>
<P>
   Police found Diaz after they received a 911 call at 12:56 a.m.
reporting a car broken down in the interstate's far right lane.
</P>
<P>
   After an initial inspection of the crime scene in the dark,
police returned to the area during daylight hours to search for
evidence. They closed the far right lane for about 45 minutes and a
second lane for another 15 minutes, which was enough to clog the
interstate and cause a delay for rushhour commuters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't like to got out there and block traffic,'' said Cobb
police Lt. George Hatfield, who is in charge of the department's
traffic enforcement unit. ``But if you wait a long time, with the
volume of traffic, you're going to lose evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   It paid off when investigators found bullet casings strewn on
the pavement and evidence that another vehicle _ possibly the
killer's _ had collided with the victim's car.
</P>
<P>
   Several shots were fired into the driver's side of the vehicle
from outside the car, according to Cobb police spokesman Andrew
Marchetta.
</P>
<P>
   No drugs or weapons were found inside the Honda, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police declined to speculate on the motive of the slaying, but
Hatfield said it would an extemely unusual case if the killer
turned out to be an enraged driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just from my perspective, it doesn't look like road rage,''
Hatfield said. ``But there's some evidence it could be.''
</P>
<P>
   Police are asking anyone in the area of I-75 southbound between
the South Marietta Parkway and Windy Hill Road (north of Atlanta)
between midnight and 1 a.m. Tuesday to contact police at
770-499-3945.

DELL'S EARNINGS RISE BY 42 PERCENT IN 1ST QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dell Computer Corp. posted first-quarter earnings Tuesday that
matched analysts' estimates, but the results disappointed some
investors.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended April 30, Dell reported earnings of $434
million, or 16 cents a diluted share, up 42 percent from $305
million, or 11 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue
rose 41 percent, to $5.54 billion from $3.92 billion. Per-share
figures reflect a reduction in shares outstanding because of stock
buybacks.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expected Dell to earn 16 cents a share, according to
First Call Corp., which tracks company earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Before Dell reported its results, its shares closed at $44.0625,
up 81.25 cents, in NASDAQ trading. But in after-hours trading, they
sank as low as $41.375. Some analysts expected Dell to exceed
estimates after Hewlett-Packard Co. reported earnings Monday that
beat Wall Street estimates in large part because of strong sales of
personal computers. Dell shares are down 20 percent from their
52-week high of $55.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that drop came from a selloff prompted by fourth-quarter
revenue growth that slowed from historically high levels. In the
first quarter, Dell's revenue growth rate of 41 percent met
analysts' expectations and represented a partial recovery from the
38 percent in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But Daniel Kunstler, an analyst with J.P. Morgan, said the sales
growth appeared to have come at a price. ``They squeaked through
with the revenue growth the Street wanted and hit the earnings
number, but gross margins look spooky,'' he said, noting that
profit margin had slipped to 21.5 percent in the quarter from 22.5
percent in the fourth quarter. ``It looks like average selling
prices are coming down, or pricing pressure was up.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell vice chairman Kevin Rollins said in a telephone interview
that the company had taken the gross margin number down in order to
be more aggressive in the market. Gross margin is off from the
fourth quarter ``and that is what we signaled we would do last
quarter,'' he said. ``We think our financial model is now back in
line with what it should be,'' he said, noting that net income as a
percentage of revenue was 7.8 percent, equal to the figure in the
quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   While Dell's growth rate is down substantially from the average
of 56 percent it had attained in the previous eight quarters, the
company still led its major competitors in unit, revenue and profit
growth during the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Dell cited a report by International Data Corp. showing that it
had advanced to the No. 2 position in worldwide market share,
behind Compaq Computer, and that the company's business grew at
about two-and-a-half times the estimated industry rate.
</P>
<P>
   As always, Dell officials credited the strength of their direct
sales model, in which the company bypasses distributors and dealers
and builds each computer to order. Because the company holds very
little inventory, it takes advantage of lower component costs, and
is always selling a fresher product, which can command a higher
profit margin. Dell said sales from its Web site exceeded $18
million a day during the quarter, accounting for 30 percent of
overall revenue.

DISCOUNT RETAIL CHAIN LOEHMANN'S FILES FOR CHAPTER 11

 By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Loehmann's Inc., the New York-based retailer that offers
designer apparel at bargain prices, filed for bankruptcy protection
Tuesday in Wilmington, Del.
</P>
<P>
   The long-troubled chain, whose first store opened in 1920, said
it had assets of $188.7 million and liabilities of $184.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, chairman and chief executive Robert
Friedman said, ``The decision to file for Chapter 11, while
difficult, represents the most viable option for restructuring our
company.''
</P>
<P>
   The bankruptcy filing had been anticipated for several reasons.
On Monday, the retailer failed to make a $5.5 million interest
payment to creditors. In addition, Loehmann's lost more than $5
million last year on sales of $432 million; the retailer's chief
financial officer, Dennis Hernreich, resigned abruptly on April 30
without explanation; on May 12, Moody's Investors Service Inc.
downgraded its debt to a status lower than junk, and at about the
same time many of the company's vendors stopped shipping to
Loehmann's.
</P>
<P>
   Loehmann's has been faced with increasing competition for its
off-price niche of the market. Department stores, under pressure to
compete with discounters and outlet malls, have increasingly been
offering shoppers deep discounts on seasonal merchandise. And
Loehmann's has been losing out on designer leftovers to other
larger off-price merchants.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, TJX Co., owner of both T.J. Maxx and Marshall's,
which did $8 billion in sales last year, has been aggressively
scooping up the best of the offerings from name houses like Ralph
Lauren and Donna Karan.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman said the filing would not have an impact on the
day-to-day operations of its 69 stores. It has nine stores in New
York state, including four in New York City; six stores in New
Jersey, and two in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   A company spokesman, however, said, it was ``too early to say
what will happen'' to either the stores or Loehmann's 2,500
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Loehmann's announced that it had secured $75 million of
debtor-in-possession financing from Congress Financial Corp.,
subject to approval from the bankruptcy court.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the increasing competitive environment, however, analysts
and stockholders say Loehmann's suffered from repeated management
missteps. Up until 1997, the Bronx-based chain was expanding both
the number of stores it operated as well as the size of the stores.
The Manhattan flagship store on lower Seventh Avenue, for example,
is nearly 60,000 square feet, almost four times the size of the
chain's first stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems as if management never grasped the seriousness of the
problems, or even their very nature,'' said Kurt Barnard, president
of Barnard's Retail Trend Report.
</P>
<P>
   The company was founded in 1920 by Frieda Loehmann, who
patrolled the fashion district and then resold her finds in a small
store on Bedford Avenue in Brooklyn. After her death in 1962, her
son, Charles, opened a second store on Fordham Road in the Bronx
and headed the company as it expanded. It went public in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   After numerous changes in ownership, Loehmann's Inc. went public
for a second time in May 1996 at $17 a share. At first, its brand
name propelled its stock to a strong run on Wall Street _ it went
as high as $30.25 in November of that year. But soon after, sales
lagged and the stock fell. It closed at 93.75 cents Monday on
NASDAQ.
</P>
<P>
   Loehmann's biggest creditors are the holders of notes that
Loehmann's sold in 1997 for a total of $95 million; Fleet Financial
Services, , which is owed $7.85 million, and CIT Commercial, which
is owed $1.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   The creditors also include such well-known fashion names as
Donna Karan, Jones Apparel Group, Kasper ASL Ltd., Calvin Klein and
Harve Benard.

TRANSFORMING FOUND OBJECTS INTO ART PRINTS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 23) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RITA REIF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST TOPSHAM, Vt. _ Several times in recent months, the graphics
designer Ivan Chermayeff packed an odd-ball assortment of found
objects in his BMW and drove from New York to this village 50 miles
east of Burlington.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived at Cone Editions, an art-print workshop, on one
occasion in March, he had five suitcases stuffed with old gloves,
flattened steel buckets, rusted iron numbers, hole-riddled boards,
mailed envelopes with canceled stamps, food choppers, boot jacks,
buttons, beach pebbles and rope winders, stuff he had collected
over decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew where each piece came from and how long he had waited
to use it,'' said Jon Cone, a master printer and founder of the
workshop that bears his name.
</P>
<P>
   Chermayeff also knew exactly how he would use the artifacts. A
painter and collage maker, he was producing assemblages for the
first time. He worked 12 hours on each of the next four days,
transforming the objects into 30 masklike fantasies of faces and
busts of people and animals. Using an innovative print-making
technology, he turned the assemblages into high-quality prints.
</P>
<P>
   Half the prints are now on view at the Ricco/Maresca Gallery, in
Manhattan, in a show that also presents 20 collages by Chermayeff,
through June 26.
</P>
<P>
   The prints are produced in editions of six and come in three
sizes, each corresponding to the size of the assemblage from which
it was made: 2 feet by 17 inches, about 3 feet by 2 feet and about
4 feet by 3 feet. Prices range from $1,200 to $6,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   Chermayeff began the first assemblage in the show, ``Tibetan
Monk,'' with a wooden rope winder that he envisioned as a head with
a wide-brimmed hat. ``The four holes in the winder became the eyes.
nose and mouth,'' he said. ``Then I gave it a body, cutting a robe
out of a piece of vermillion paper and adding buttons _ pebbles _
to bring it to life.''
</P>
<P>
   On a return visit to the workshop three weeks ago, Chermayeff
brought the makings of another assemblage, ``Blonde Afro'': a seat
from an Alvar Aalto stool, painted yellow, was used as the hair; a
rusted 30-pound iron switch-plate, pierced with holes for bolting
to railroad ties, became its longish John Carradine-like face,
stones its earrings and papers for its red dress and pink hand.
</P>
<P>
   With its eft shoulder cut off, the figure seemed to turn from a
front view to a side view. The change exaggerated the ugliness of
the face, giving it a haughty look. ``That face needed an attitude
to carry it off,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes faces are entirely of my own making,'' he said.
``Sometimes they already exist in the things I find.'' The
switch-plate was an example of the latter and was one very few
artifacts in his assemblages that he bought from a gallery. ``When
it was shown to me, I immediately saw the holes for the eyes, nose
and mouth _ a face,'' Chermayeff said.
</P>
<P>
   He had to improvise, however, on a crushed steel bucket that he
found on the street and used as the head of the wrinkled-face,
one-eyed man in ``Target,'' another print. A black pebble became
the eye, a strip of black tape, the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no difference for me between making an assemblage and
a collage,'' he said. But to capture three dimensionality in a
two-dimensional print ``requires a lot of work,'' he said, adding,
``most of it not by me.'' He stabilized parts in the assemblage so
they did not move while it was scanned. He and Cone then used a
computer to adjust the colors, correct the shadows and touch up the
imperfections on the image.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might put in 10 minutes of conversation to tell Jon what
should be done,'' Chermayeff said. ``But he then puts in long hours
of work to make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Chermayeff's assemblages are as direct and colorful as the
distinctive logos his firm, Chermayeff &AMP; Geismar Inc., made for
Chase Manhattan Bank and the Mobil Corp., as well as its posters
for Masterpiece Theater. His street sculpture, the vermilion No. 9,
on Fifth Avenue, bears his personal design signature: bold scale
(it is 10 feet tall), voluptuous roundness, brilliant color and
wit. After 27 years it is still patted, leaned on and much
photographed by passersby.
</P>
<P>
   He decided to make assemblages after the gallery owners, Roger
Ricco and Frank Maresca, showed him examples of the high resolution
prints Cone produced. ``Ivan is an image maker,'' said Ricco. ``It
seemed a wonderful opportunity to introduce him as a print maker.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone uses a scanner of his own design that is large enough to
accommodate works, like the assemblages, that have to be scanned on
a flat surface. The images are then digitally printed with archival
inks on thick quality paper. ``It's 100 percent rag, extremely
white and porous to retain the color,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now Chermayeff's assemblages survive only as prints. They were
dismantled on the scanning bed an hour or so after they were
printed. The scanned images will be erased from the computer after
the editions are completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I care about the process, more than the end result,''
Chermayeff said. ``Of course, I want a piece to be the best I can
make it. But all the same, the act of doing it is what I enjoy _
making something out of not much.''

HONG KONG TRIES TO LIMIT COURT RULING ON RESIDENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Desperate to stem a possible flood of migrants from
mainland China, Hong Kong said Tuesday that it would ask the
Chinese government to overturn, in effect, a court ruling that
granted Hong Kong residency to more than a million people.
</P>
<P>
   The request, to reinterpret the provisions of the Hong Kong
constitution that were the basis of the ruling, is tantamount to
asking Beijing to overrule Hong Kong's highest court. The move has
touched off a storm of protest from legal experts and pro-democracy
politicians here. They say it will sabotage the rule of law in the
former British colony.
</P>
<P>
   The chief executive of Hong Kong, Tung Chee-hwa, said Tuesday
that he had no choice but to appeal to China to resolve a growing
immigration crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us would like happy family reunions,'' Tung said at a
news conference. ``Who wouldn't? But what we face is a problem of
unplanned population growth, which Hong Kong, as a society, will be
unable to bear.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Chinese government grants the request, officials here
estimate that the number of mainland Chinese eligible for residency
would drop, to less than 200,000 from 1.67 million.
</P>
<P>
   Tung has warned that allowing 1.6 million people into Hong Kong
would impose a calamitous burden on the enclave, which has 6.8
million people, overcrowding schools and hospitals, swelling
unemployment, lowering living standards and costing the government
$91 billion in additional capital spending.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said that in seeking to quell an immigration crisis, the
government had instead caused a legal crisis. By appealing to
Beijing, they said, Hong Kong was subverting the authority of its
courts and jeopardizing its role as a citadel of Western-style
legal practices within China.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government lost in court,'' said Margaret Ng, a lawyer and
member of the Legislature. ``So it went off to Beijing to use
political means to overturn the ruling. It shows a government that
refuses to be bound by laws as interpreted by the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   Tung denied that Hong Kong was undermining its courts. He said
the National People's Congress in China had the right to
reinterpret provisions of the Hong Kong constitution, the Basic
Law. But he said such a tool should be used sparingly, and only in
extraordinary situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have looked at all the options, and this seems to be the
only way out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem deepened in January, when the Court of Final Appeal
granted residency to children born in mainland China who have at
least one parent who lives in Hong Kong. The court said the right
of residency applied to children regardless of whether the parent
was a Hong Kong resident before or after their births.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was attacked almost immediately. Chinese officials
said the court seemed to be asserting authority over that of the
central government in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure, the court issued an extraordinary clarification
that affirmed that China still had the ultimate legal authority.
</P>
<P>
   But that left the substance of the ruling intact. At first, the
Hong Kong government said it was not interested in challenging the
substance. Yet officials soon announced that 1.6 million mainland
Chinese migrants could pour across the border.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the Hong Kong government say it exaggerated the
potential numbers and economic effects in a campaign to scare the
public and drum up support for its legal appeal to China.
</P>
<P>
   For mainland Chinese to obtain residency in Hong Kong, they
would have to show proof of parentage. That would be difficult for
the 1.1 million illegitimate children included in the Hong Kong
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   If the government goal was to generate support, it was
remarkably successful. Nearly 80 percent of Hong Kong residents
support reducing the number of potential migrants, even if it means
challenging the ruling, said a poll by the Hong Kong Policy
Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
   One option for resolving the crisis would be for China to amend
the Hong Kong constitution. But Chinese officials are loath to
change the document, which they largely drafted.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, an amendment would have wait at least until the
National People's Congress holds its next annual meeting in March.
Tung said Hong Kong could not afford to wait that long.
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of the government said the critics were not adjusting
to the realities of being part of a country with a legal system
sharply different to the English common-law system that prevails in
Hong Kong.

CHILD-PROOF HANDGUN LOCKS GET BIPARTISAN BACKING IN SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an act that seemed unlikely before last month's
school shooting in Colorado, Senate Republicans Tuesday joined
Democrats in approving a plan to require child safety locks on
newly purchased handguns.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, House Speaker Dennis Hastert said he backed a
Democratic plan long championed by Senator Edward M. Kennedy and
others to raise the minimum age for gun purchasers to 21 from 18.
While licensed gun dealers already are prohibited from selling to
people under the age of 21, unlicensed sellers such as private
individuals and gun-show dealers face no such prohibition.
</P>
<P>
   These two actions, combined with more gun control votes expected
Wednesday, signaled that the gun lobby has lost considerable clout
in the wake of a series of shootings by students at schools across
the country, most recently at Columbine High School in Littleton,
Colo.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, for example, a similar Senate proposal requiring gun
safety locks received only 39 votes and was rejected by all but
three Republicans. Tuesday, the Senate voted 78-20 for an amendment
to the juvenile crime bill to require that new handguns be sold
either with a safety lock or case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows unquestionably that the horror of what took place in
Littleton has had its effect,'' said Senator John Chafee, the Rhode
Island Republican who co-sponsored the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   To gain support for the measure, sponsors included limited
liability protections to gun owners who lock their guns. But the
sponsors played down the liability provision, noting that gun
owners are not liable under current law. Nonetheless, the liability
provision served a political purpose, giving many Republicans a
reason to switch from last year's position and back the measure,
sponsors said.
</P>
<P>
   The two Massachusetts senators, Kennedy and Senator John F.
Kerry, supported the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association, which opposed last year's
measure on gun safety locks, dropped its opposition Tuesday, saying
the amendment had been adequately modified with the liability
provision. ``We did not oppose it,'' said NRA spokesman Bill
Powers. Asked if the Littleton shooting had changed the dynamic on
gun control, he said, ``Ask the senators.''
</P>
<P>
   During hours of emotional debate Tuesday, senators favoring gun
control cited cases in which children have used a gun and
accidentally killed themselves or someone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just last weekend, a 7-year-old boy named Brian Welch killed
himself accidentally with a gun he found in his father's drawer,''
said Senator Herb Kohl, the Wisconsin Democrat who introduced the
safety-locks amendment. ``What do we say to Brian's family if we
cannot take steps as reasonable as this one?''
</P>
<P>
   Kohl attributed passage of the measure to the shooting at
Columbine High School in which two students killed 13 people before
killing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is that, in the wake of Littleton, both sides have
grown up a bit: Democrats in finally acknowledging that culture may
have something to do with juvenile violence today, and Republicans
in finally endorsing reasonable measures to take handguns out of
the hands of kids who shouldn't have them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The measure does have loopholes, however. It applies only to
handguns and only to those sold after the legislation would be
signed into law. In addition, it does not require purchasers to
keep the safety device on the guns, although they are encouraged to
do so. The legislation left it up to gun manufacturers to design
the safety devices.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the measure is a major step beyond current law, which
requires only the option for gun purchasers to get a safety lock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is so long overdue it is ludicrous,'' said Naomi Paiss,
spokeswoman for Handgun Control. But, she said, ``it would have
been better if it included long guns.'' She said her organization's
long-term goal is to make guns themselves childproof, noting that
everything from aspirin bottles to teddy bears are regulated for
child safety, ``while guns are immune from that.''
</P>
<P>
   The mood began to shift against the gun lobby last Wednesday,
after Senate Republicans faced criticism for rejecting a proposal
requiring background checks on people buying weapons at gun shows.
Republicans reversed themselves the following day.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, in an interview Tuesday with the Associated Press,
thrust himself into the gun debate by backing a requirement for gun
purchasers to be 21 years old and backing a measure to mandate
background checks at gun shows, which is already required at retail
establishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just saying 21 is basically a standard of adulthood, and
there's probably a uniformity that fits there,'' Hastert said.
``You have kids who can't buy alcohol till they're 21 years of age,
but they can go out and buy a handgun, and I believe there needs to
be some conformity to those types of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal law already prevents licensed gun dealers from selling
to those under 21, but Hastert went further than that because
unlicensed gun sellers are allowed to sell to those under 21. For
example, a person under 21 currently can buy a gun from a friend or
private seller at a gun show.
</P>
<P>
   Handgun Control's Paiss said raising the purchase age to 21
would be a significant move because 18- and 19-year-olds commit
more violent crime than anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton promptly seized upon Hasert's statement,
applauding the speaker's effort to ``raise the age of handgun
ownership from 18 to 21.'' However, Hastert spokesman John Feehery
said the speaker's comment applied only to gun sales, not gun
possession.
</P>
<P>
   In other votes Tuesday, the Senate agreed to provisions that
would stiffen penalties for gang members who commit offenses and
for wearing body armor while committing a crime.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is scheduled Wednesday to consider other gun-control
amendments and could vote on final passage of the overriding
juvenile crime bill. If it passes, the bill then goes to the House
for consideration.

OF THE ENGLISH IN ENGLAND, BY AN AMERICAN FOR AMERICANS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 23) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MATT WOLF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Displacement and exile are crucial issues to the
American dramatist Richard Nelson, whose plays, perhaps not
coincidentally, usually have their premieres in England, though
their author lives along the Hudson River, north of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson has written about American academics in Britain in his
play ``Some Americans Abroad'' and about Britons living in America
in the more recent ``New England.'' Both originated with the Royal
Shakespeare Company, his de facto home, which has presented nine of
his plays. (``Some Americans Abroad'' was seen at Lincoln Center in
1990 and ``New England'' at the Manhattan Theater Club in 1995.)
</P>
<P>
   But ``Goodnight Children Everywhere,'' his latest play, opening
Off Broadway on Wednesday at Playwrights Horizons, marks the first
time that Nelson has written a work wholly about the English and
set in England _ in a South London apartment, to be exact, in the
late spring of 1945, near the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was definitely a risk,'' said the author, 48, by telephone
from New York one recent morning. ``I knew I was touching on very
sensitive self-myths of the English personality, as defined by
World War II, since there was probably no more self-defining time
for the British.'' The play received mixed reviews in its Royal
Shakespeare debut in Stratford-on-Avon in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Among those much taken with it was Trevor Nunn, artistic
director of the Royal National Theater, who was head of the Royal
Shakespeare when Nelson first began working there more than a
decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that audiences would pretty much swear that it was
written by an English writer simply because its idiom is so
unforced and light and isn't thrown away,'' Nunn said, praising
Nelson's gift for ``writing in shades'' rather than black and
white.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, said Nelson, who is directing the new production,
preview audiences are perceiving it ``as much more about people and
children than about Englishness.'' The title is taken from a
popular wartime song that itself echoes a well-known closing line
used during the war by a BBC radio announcer, Derek McCulloch, on a
program called ``Children's Hour.''
</P>
<P>
   To English audiences, then, the phrase ``Goodnight Children
Everywhere'' evokes a nostalgia for the period while at the same
time hinting at the requiem for childhood that the play in part
describes.
</P>
<P>
   The story involves the return of a family's youngest child,
Peter, 17, who was sent to Canada for six years for safety during
the war. He is reunited with his three sisters in their parents'
apartment, the parents having died during his absence.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the sisters spent part of their own childhoods in the
countryside, away from the bombs falling on London. One, now
pregnant, is married to a doctor (played by Jon De Vries), whose
child by a former wife has died. The dislocation of individuals by
events beyond their control is another underlying theme of the
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my continued portrayals of people who are outsiders and
exiles and out of time and out of place,'' Nelson said, ``stories
of adolescence are very much part of that: who feels more out of
time and out of place than an adolescent?''
</P>
<P>
   The New York company includes Chris Stafford as the sexually
curious Peter, who must tellingly function as boy, brother and man
all at once, and Heather Goldenhersh, Kali Rocha and Robin Weigert
as the siblings who echo a trio of provincial Russian sisters in a
play written a century ago. If Chekhov overtly flavors ``Goodnight
Children Everywhere,'' so, too, does Strindberg, whom Nelson has
also adapted.
</P>
<P>
   It is Strindberg whom Nelson mentions in explaining an
incestuous encounter in the play. ``The multiplicity of motivation
for every action is indicative of our time,'` he said, paraphrasing
Strindberg, who was referring to the 1880s. ``But I think the same
is very true for us. To look for one clear motivation is the wrong
way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Not for the first time, Nelson said, he favors a drama built on
ambiguity and complexity that doesn't wear its theme on its sleeve.
Whatever other resonances ``Goodnight Children Everywhere'' offers,
Nelson said, it presents a synopsis of a life. ``In one sense,'' he
said, ``it's about a boy who goes through his entire adolescence in
two and a half days.''

SUIT SEEKS DAMAGES FROM FORD IN AMBULANCE BREAKDOWNS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a, f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHELLEY MURPHY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The stories are the same from Boston to the Berkshires
and all the way south to Nantucket: Ford ambulances constantly
breaking down without warning, stranding patients and frustrating
emergency workers.
</P>
<P>
   Now some 100 ambulance companies and municipalities throughout
Massachusetts have banded together to urge a federal judge to
accept their class-action suit against Ford Motor Co., the nation's
largest manufacturer of vehicles built for use as ambulances.
</P>
<P>
   They claim that drive belts on the 1992, 1993 and 1994 Econoline
and F-Series ambulances frequently flew off the vehicles, yet Ford
ignored the problem for years.
</P>
<P>
   They also claim transmissions on the ambulances are defective,
requiring premature and frequent replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time the belt broke when the ambulance was on a highway
and there was a heart-attack patient on board,'' Chris Sampson,
president of the Swansea Ambulance Corp., wrote in a court document
detailing numerous problems with the nonprofit group's 1992 Ford
F350 ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   The breakdown forced the patient to wait by the side of the road
for 15 minutes until another ambulance arrived, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Ford say the company acknowledged a problem with
the accessory drive-belt on some of its ambulances in 1996,
offering to replace the part and reimburse owners for the cost of
repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's lawyers insist there is no evidence of a ``common
defect'' in the ambulances and blame the chronic transmission
problems on ambulance companies for ``failure to properly care for
and repair their vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   But Weston Fire Chief John Thorburn says the department's 1992
Ford Econoline Ambulance is ``the most unreliable ambulance'' he's
seen in his 38 years on the job.
</P>
<P>
   And Boston officials say they finally switched from Ford to
Chevrolet after constant problems and costly repairs to the city's
Ford ambulances.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of small towns, saying they don't have the resources to
take on the Detroit giant, are asking the court to allow them to
sign onto a suit filed against Ford several years ago by three
family-owned ambulance companies _ Professional Ambulance and
Oxygen Service in Cambridge, Action Ambulance Service in Stoneham
and Fallon Service in Milton.
</P>
<P>
   Those companies are seeking hundreds of thousands of dollars in
repair costs, transmission replacements and lost revenue from Ford
in a suit filed in US District Court in Boston that alleges breach
of warranty and unfair and deceptive practices.
</P>
<P>
   During a hearing Monday in Boston before US District Judge
George A. O'Toole Jr., Attorney Lynn E. Parseghian, of the
Washington, D.C. firm of O'Melveny &AMP; Myers, which represents Ford,
argued that a class-action suit would ``create a monster.''
</P>
<P>
   Parseghian said a class-action trial would embroil the court in
a ``morass of individual issues,'' involving hundreds of vehicles
and thousands of complaints.
</P>
<P>
   But Attorney Joanne D'Alcomo, of the Boston law firm of
Schneider, Reilly, Zabin &AMP; Costello, who represents the ambulance
companies, said it would be a burden to force small towns that own
one ambulance to sue Ford individually.
</P>
<P>
   ``We say that Ford knowingly sent out these vehicles, knowing
they were going to break down, knowing patients would be inside,''
D'Alcomo said.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alcomo urged the judge to grant class certification to anyone
who bought a 1992, 1993, or 1994 Ford Econoline or F-Series van,
equipped with an ambulance preparation package, a 7.3-liter diesel
engine and a E40D transmission.
</P>
<P>
   O'Toole has taken the matter under advisement.
</P>
<P>
   Ford is one of just a few manufacturers that builds chassis,
incomplete vans and trucks containing an engine and wheel base,
which are converted to ambulances by independent companies.
</P>
<P>
   The suit focuses on Ford-manufactured parts: a serpentine belt
drive and transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ford acknowledged problems with the serpentine belt in
1996, D'Alcomo said the company knew about them years earlier but
continued to sell ambulances with the defective belts. Ford denies
any common problem with its transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman Fire Chief Timothy P. Travers said the town's only
ambulance, a 1994 Ford Econoline van, had driven only 13,000 miles
when its transmission needed to be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transmission has operated so roughly because of shifting
problems that patients riding in the ambulance complained of
discomfort,'' Travers wrote in court documents.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time that Ford has denied the existence of a problem
in the ambulance transmissions, D'Alcomo said Ford ``leaped into
action'' when a large armored truck company with a fleet of 500
Ford trucks complained about the same transmission.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alcomo said documents show that Ford gave the armored truck
company 10 free transmissions, then split the cost of replacing
other transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the ambulance industry did capture Ford's attention more
than a decade ago. In 1987, Ford recalled 22,000 ambulances to
correct safety-related fuel problems that caused at least two dozen
fires and 15 injuries.

$70M PATRIOTS STADIUM FUNDING BILL STAGGERS TO PASSAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The four-year political battle over funding for a New
England Patriots stadium reached its dramatic denouement Tuesday
when the Legislature passed a $70 million bill that Governor Paul
Cellucci said he would sign next week.
</P>
<P>
   But even on a day when it looked like the skids had been well
greased for final approval, the measure hit what could have been a
fatal snag.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-hour ordeal began when the House approved the bill,
but only after changing the legislation in a way that could have
jeopardized the crucial 2001 timeframe for completing a $225
million privately financed replacement for Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the bill was restored to its original intent, but
not before sending a scare through both branches.
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Thomas F. Birmingham, stunned by the day's
events, said the stadium issue has been ``like riding a roller
coaster being strapped in backwards.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, after the Senate approved the bill without debate 36-1,
the Chelsea Democrat added: ``All's well that ends well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots declined to comment, saying they still have not
read the legislation authorizing $70 million for road, sewer and,
other infrastructure improvements along Route 1. In return, the
team would pay the state $1 million a year, and satellite parking
lots must pay the state $400,000 annually.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran smiled when it was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long, long, saga in Massachusetts,'' the Mattapan
Democrat said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, out of concern for a trailer park on land
where the new facility is planned, the House deleted language that
would have forced dozens of residents to relocate within 180 days,
instead giving them two years. Kraft owns the land and will need it
cleared to make way for the open-air stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives also refused language that would have rushed an
environmental review so the facility could be built by 2001.
Another amendment was thrown in requiring the team to study moving
its Smithfield, R.I., pre-season training camp to Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   But Birmingham, mystified over the last-minute changes to a bill
that leaders of both branches had already agreed upon after intense
negotiation, called the revisions ``fatal'' and refused to adopt
them. The Senate passed the measure without the House changes, and
pressured Finneran to restore the bill to its original form.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reached out to the speaker because I recognized these
amendments put the entire Patriots agreement in peril,'' Birmingham
said. The House gave in, and passed the bill 123-23.
</P>
<P>
   The original debate in the House spanned three hours, during
which there was plenty of rhetorical hyperbole.
</P>
<P>
   One representative implied the Patriots had the cultural
significance of Paul Revere and Plymouth Rock. There were also
statements of support for practical reasons. Repesentative Barbara
Hyland, a Foxborough Republican, said the measure would actually
improve sewer and water problems in the town of 15,000.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the compelling monologue delivered by
Finneran on the floor of the House, which, over the years, has
voted on a handful of different stadium proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Finneran's hard-line stance against the state buying
land around Foxboro Stadium brought legislative action to a halt
and nearly pushed the Patriots into the arms of Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker -- whose sharp comments about Kraft in the past led
some to believe there was personal animosity between the two --
issued a lengthy screed about society's skewed priorities, about
principles and precedents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The members of this House have been maligned in an
extraordinary way, for doing what I think is appropriate,''
Finneran said emphatically. ``We have to manage in a prudent and
responsible way other people's money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, in the final analysis, it's a very positive
conclusion to a long, long, torturous debate that has affected the
deliberation of this chamber in many, many matters,'' Finneran
said.
</P>
<P>
   Members gave him a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   But Representative Christopher Hodgkins, a Lee Democrat,
punctured the serious tone in the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you kidding me?'' Hodgkins said, springing to his feet.
``We're talking like this issue is a big moral issue?...This is
nothing but the big boys in the back rooms making the deals with
professional sports.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House lost little time Tuesday in trying
to capitalize on Israeli Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak's victory
to invigorate stalled Middle East peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who congratulated Barak by phone Monday
night, spoke Tuesday to three other key players: King Abdullah of
Jordan, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters before a long-scheduled meeting in the
White House with Abdullah, Clinton said the ``road map'' was laid
out for implementing accords between Israel and the Palestinians
that were reached at the Wye River Plantation in Maryland last
October, as well as for ``final status'' talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're certainly both willing to do it,'' Clinton said
of his and Barak's intentions to move forward.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they expected the State
Department's chief Middle East negotiator, Dennis Ross, to visit
the region soon. But they said it had not yet been decided whether
Ross would wait until Barak had finished forming his government _ a
process that could take weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Although there was a new mood of promise, officials cautioned
that expectations should not get out of hand just because Barak is
perceived to be more receptive toward reaching a final agreement
with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Fundamental differences remain between Israel and the
Palestinians on the vital issues of security relations between
Israel and the Palestinians, the status of Jerusalem and the return
of Palestinian refugees, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one should expect this can be solved overnight,'' a White
House official said. ``Our expectations should not be similar to
the size of Barak's landslide. But we do feel a renewed sense of
hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of this hope came from the fact that with Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's defeat, there was suddenly more contact
between leaders in the region, the official said. For example,
Barak spoke Tuesday with both Arafat and Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Abdullah was outspoken in his enthusiasm for
Barak. ``We're very, very optimistic,'' he said. ``We see eye to
eye on many issues and we're very optimistic of taking the peace
process forward.''
</P>
<P>
   It seemed fairly clear, officials said, that once Barak forms a
government, he will be able to finish carrying out the Wye
agreements that Netanyahu only partially fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   Under that accord, Israel agreed to withdraw from 13 percent
more of the West Bank in three phases over a 12-week period.
Netanyahu withdrew from 2 percent before his government collapsed
and he called elections last December.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Arafat in April, Clinton called on Israel and the
Palestinians to complete final status talks within a year.
</P>
<P>
   He also said in the letter that he would convene a new set of
peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians within six months
after the Israeli elections.
</P>
<P>
   The new peace talks, aimed at kick-starting the negotiations
over the final-status questions, would be in Washington and would
most likely be called much sooner than in six months, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   There were some suggestions Tuesday among analysts outside the
administration that the talks Clinton outlined in his letter might
be broadened to include Jordan and Egypt. Mubarak is scheduled to
meet with Clinton at the White House on July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Another theme that has re-emerged with Barak's victory is the
administration's goal _ and Barak's desire _ to restart talks
between Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Syria wants Israel to give back the Golan Heights, which were
captured in the 1967 war. Israel wants Syria, which effectively
controls the Lebanese government, to stop backing the Hezbollah
forces that attack Israeli soldiers in the southern part of
Lebanon, which Israel occupies. Barak announced during his election
campaign that, if he was elected, he would start negotiations to
withdraw the Israeli soldiers from Lebanon within the next year.
</P>
<P>
   For Barak to tackle two sets of negotiations _ with the
Palestinians and with the Syrians _ may prove to be overly
ambitious, even though the administration is encouraging such a
move, Middle East experts said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Singer, who was a negotiator for the Israelis on the Oslo
accords, the initial peace agreement with the Palestinians, and is
now a lawyer in Washington, said Tuesday that it had proved
difficult for the the late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin to
pursue separate negotiations with the Syrians and the Palestinians.
He predicted that it would prove difficult for Barak, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barak will want to do both,'' Singer said. ``But it is
impossible to do both, to make the Israeli government understand
two such important peace treaties. The collective Israeli belly
cannot digest both.''
</P>
<P>
   On the negotiations with the Palestinians, the administration's
goal of settling the major questions in one year, even with Barak
as prime minister, may be unrealistic, said Robert Satloff, the
executive director of the Washington Institute for Near East
Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Satloff, who has spent the last three months in Israel, said
that the ``atmospherics'' for negotiations with Arafat would
improve with Barak at the table but that in some respects Barak is
tougher than Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a more credible negotiating partner, but Arafat knows
that Barak is no dove,'' Satloff said.

 &HT;    Stunning effects, new themes redeem flaws in ``Star Wars:
Episode 1 _ The Phantom Menace''
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The long wait to return to a galaxy far, far away ends at 12:01
a.m. Wednesday, with the release of the first new Star Wars film in
16 years. The highly anticipated first prequel to George Lucas'
original space-opera trilogy can't possibly live up to astronomical
fan expectations and at times falls far short. But once the mythic
sci-fi adventure film blasts off for the familiar desert planet of
Tatooine, ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace'' becomes a
thoroughly enjoyable trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Episode I,'' which introduces the future Darth Vader as a
selfless, 9-year-old slave boy named Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan
Kenobi as an apprentice Jedi Knight, was devised by Lucas more than
22 years ago as a back story for the original Star Wars. He began
developing his outline in 1994, creating a new trilogy that will
follow Anakin's fall to the dark side of the Force, before his
redemption by his son, Luke.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas realizes his vision with a stunning array of richly
detailed computer-generated characters and sets that take
filmmaking to an astonishing new level. He also deepens the saga's
religious aspects, introducing Anakin as the ``chosen one'' who
will bring balance to the Force. But the lord of the ``Star Wars''
universe almost scuttles his achievement with lame, childish humor
aimed to please young kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Phantom Menace'' _ whose title recalls the old Saturday
adventure serials from which Lucas draws inspiration _ follows a
story arc similar to the original film. It begins with a galactic
conflict; concerns an idealistic boy who dreams of leaving home to
find his destiny among the stars; involves the training of a young
Jedi Knight; and ends with a climactic battle akin to the
destruction of the Death Star.
</P>
<P>
   Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and his apprentice,
Obi-Wan (Ewan McGregor), are dispatched to resolve a blockade of
the peaceful planet Naboo by the greedy Trade Federation. Its
Neimoidian officials talk like characters from the Japanese samurai
epics that also imbue Lucas' cosmic parable of good vs. evil.
</P>
<P>
   Shadowy Sith Lord Darth Sidious orders the Neimoidian viceroy to
kill the Jedi ambassadors. After a brief but exciting clash with
battle and destroyer droids, the Jedi escape to the planet Naboo to
warn Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) of an impending invasion by a
robot army. It's here that ``The Phantom Menace'' falters.
</P>
<P>
   Qui-Gon saves the life of a clumsy, floppy-eared creature named
Jar Jar Binks (voiced by Ahmed Best), whose race, the Gungan, live
in breathtaking underwater cities on Naboo. Designed to appeal to
children and provide comic relief, Jar Jar is the film's biggest
flaw. He's annoying, his pidgin dialect is impossible to understand
and his pratfall-laden gags aren't funny. Give me a growling
Wookiee any day.
</P>
<P>
   The secondary digital characters who inhabit Tatooine _ such as
the menacing Podrace champion, Sebulba, and Anakin's gruff, winged
owner, Watto _ are much more convincing than Qui-Gon's unwelcome
sidekick. The adrenaline-throttling Podrace, which pays homage to
Ben Hur's chariot dash, also features cameos by Sand People, Jawas
and Jabba the Hutt.
</P>
<P>
   The Queen's sleek, chrome ship is forced to land on Tatooine,
where she is tracked by Sidious' lethal apprentice, Darth Maul (Ray
Park). There, Qui-Gon discovers young Anakin, an aspiring Podracer
with Jedi reflexes, in whom the Force is unusually strong. ``The
chosen one he may be, but grave danger I sense in his training,''
Jedi Master Yoda (Frank Oz) later ominously tells Obi-Wan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Phantom Menace'' sets the stage for Episodes II and III by
planting seeds of romance between Anakin and 14-year-old Amidala,
who will someday give birth to Luke and Leia, and establishing the
sly political ambition of seemingly well-meaning Senator Palpatine
(Ian McDiarmid, reprising his role from Return of the Jedi).
</P>
<P>
   Lucas focuses on symbiotic relationships in this first chapter,
tying the notion of two life forms living together for mutual
advantage to his underlying theme of balance. ``Always two there
are,'' Yoda says of the Sith Lords. ``No more, no less.'' The Jedi
Knight and his apprentice share a similar synergy. The Gungan and
Naboo people who inhabit the besieged planet are forced to pull
together to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Directing his first film in 22 years, Lucas makes heavy use of
his trademark wipe dissolves to cut among ``Episode I'''s multiple
storylines and short scenes. The performances come second to
lightsaber duels and starfighter battles, yet Neeson (''Schindler's
List'') carries himself with a strong, sage bearing, while McGregor
(''Trainspotting'') nicely approximates the speech of the elder
Obi-Wan, Alec Guinness.
</P>
<P>
   Like Anakin's Podracer, ``The Phantom Menace'' gets off to a
faulty start, but soon recovers and races to a rousing finish.
</P>
<P>
   GRADE: B
</P>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Under increasing public pressure to resolve the
conflict in Kosovo, President Clinton said Tuesday that he would
not rule out the use of ground troops but that he was hopeful that
diplomatic efforts under way with the Russians would be successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I and everyone else has always said that we intend to see our
objectives achieved and that we have not and will not take any
option off the table,'' Clinton told reporters at the White House
when asked if he was reconsidering the use of ground troops to
expel Yugoslav forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   While administration officials insisted that the president's
comments did not signal a change of policy, Clinton has come under
increasing pressure, particularly from Britain, to consider ground
troops. The air war went into its 55th day Tuesday without having
achieved its goals. Britain is worried that troops need to be
deployed by June in order to prevent a catastrophe this winter for
the Kosovar refugees who have been forced from their homes and are
living in tent encampments.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Clinton had indicated only that he approved of the
Pentagon and NATO decision to update a military assessment of a
need for ground troops, as well as other military options like the
size of a peacekeeping force. His aides and military officials have
repeatedly insisted that ground troops were not a viable option,
while acknowledging that the Pentagon, as a matter of course, has
reviewed contingencies, including land combat.
</P>
<P>
   The British foreign minister, Robin Cook, appeared to soften his
stance on the need for ground troops Tuesday, after he failed to
sway his NATO allies in Brussels on Monday. He is still planning to
come to Washington on Thursday, though, to press the case.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and the Pentagon continued to press the air campaign
Tuesday night, although poor weather restricted airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton defended those strikes Tuesday, insisting that ``we
ought to stay with the strategy that we have and work it through to
the end.''
</P>
<P>
   The renewed discussion of ground troops, combined with a
measurable slip in American public support for the NATO air
campaign, is prompting the Clinton administration to scramble to
find a diplomatic solution to the conflict before the use of ground
troops becomes inevitable and raises the possibility of American
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the pressure for a diplomatic solution is a sense that
the unity of the NATO alliance is increasingly fractious. Several
countries, including Italy and Greece, have been fretting about the
lengthy bombing campaign and its strains on domestic politics.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Tuesday: ``I am very hopeful, obviously, that the
diplomatic efforts that are being made in the State Department and
with the Russians will bear some fruit.''
</P>
<P>
   Talks between Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott; the
special Russian envoy to the Balkans, Victor Chernomyrdin, and
President Martii Ahtisaari of Finland, were to continue on
Wednesday morning. The talks have centered on ways to approach
Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav president, about proposals that
would lead to an end to the bombing campaign and the withdrawal of
Yugoslav forces from Kosovo. Finland is not part of NATO but is a
member of the European Union and will lead the union starting this
summer, giving it extra clout in any peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and NATO have been discussing the possible composition of
an international security force that would return the refugees to
Kosovo, and have disagreed recently over when to stop the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   While the president has avoided committing ground troops, he has
pledged that the United States would send soldiers as part of a
peacekeeping force when the war is over. A Pentagon spokesman said
Tuesday that that peacekeeping force would probably involve 45,000
to 50,000 soldiers, instead of the 28,000 contemplated before the
air war in Yugoslavia began, and that America would provide between
10 percent and 15 percent of those troops _ or 4,500 to 7,500.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the talks Tuesday, Talbott told reporters, ``These
are very tough issues but serious people are working on them.'' He
declined to give details of the talks. Some reports suggested that
Chernomyrdin would go to Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital, later this
week.
</P>
<P>
   While the shuttle diplomacy has yielded little so far, NATO's
airing of differences over ground troops and the president's remark
could be seen as a signal to Milosevic that NATO would not relent
in its campaign.

mayors warned in a letter Tuesday. Spearheaded by Seattle Mayor
Paul Schell, the Cascadia Mayors Conference warning came as senior
Canadian officials appeared in Washington, D.C., to press the case
for repeal of Section 110 of the 1996 Immigration Act. Section 110
would, in essence, require that U.S.-bound Canadians get out of
their cars and offer proof of identity, as well as stop and
formally check out of the United States when headed north again.

   JERUSALEM _ Once, the story goes, Ehud Barak's wife came home,
found a woman's dress in her husband's closet and traces of
lipstick on his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   When she tried to awaken him for an explanation, all he said
was, ``Let me sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   The next morning Nava Barak learned that her husband, who
commanded an elite commando unit, had dressed as a woman and landed
on the beach in Beirut with several of his men. They were all
driven to the hideout of Palestinians who had participated in the
massacre of 11 Israeli Olympic athletes in Munich.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's commandos killed three of the Palestinians who
masterminded the operation. It was 1973.
</P>
<P>
   The story, retold by Ilan Kfir in his biography, ``Barak _
Soldier Number One,'' speaks volumes about the man who became
Israel's new prime minister Monday night by defeating Benjamin
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's most decorated soldier, Barak has earned a James
Bond-like reputation for daring. To many Israelis, his name is
synonymous with the bold missions that are part of Israeli legend.
</P>
<P>
   But he's also known for his brilliance and his reserve, and he
sometimes unintentionally comes across as arrogant, stiff and cold
_ the kind of guy who would tell a worried wife to let him be.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got the nature of a special agent,'' Kfir, who had
nothing but praise for Barak, said. ``He's naturally suspicious. It
takes him a long time to get to know people.''
</P>
<P>
   His traits of daring and reticence are likely to guide the prime
minister-elect in any negotiations with the Palestinians and the
Syrians, observers say.
</P>
<P>
   A hawkish dove in Israel's political universe, Barak served 35
years in the Israeli army as a platoon leader, tank-battalion chief
and senior intelligence analyst before becoming a lieutenant
general and army chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, he oversaw Israel's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and
the West Bank town of Jericho and likes to boast that he played a
key role in the negotiations with Jordan that led to a peace deal
the same year.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, Barak's ideas for peace with the Palestinians are not
that much different from his predecessor's. Barak, like Netanyahu,
wants Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem, a majority of West Bank
settlements to stay under Israeli control and a demilitarized
Palestinian entity.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Netanyahu, Barak believes that Israel is strong
enough to trade land for peace because it has the advantages of a
productive economy, a stable government and a powerful military.
</P>
<P>
   During the five-month election campaign, Barak surrounded
himself with military advisers who agreed with Barak's platform
that Israel is in a position to cede territory for peace.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, he wrapped himself in the mantle of the late
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was assassinated by a Jewish
extremist in 1995. Many Israelis say Barak's strong character and
military background remind them of Rabin, who was also a former
chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``He appeals to Israelis as a man of his word, a more reliable
man than Netanyahu,'' said Yaron Ezrahi, a political analyst at
Jerusalem's Hebrew University. ``This is a class of man in line
with Rabin.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1942 on a remote ``kibbutz,'' or collective farm, near
the Lebanese border, Barak grew up on another ``kibbutz'' near Tel
Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   His parents believed in building Israel into a socialist state.
His father fled Russia to Palestine in 1912 after the Cossacks
killed his parents. His grandparents on his mother's side died in
the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Barak showed signs of genius and an aptitude for the
piano. He was one of a few children selected for music lessons and
is now an accomplished classical pianist _ a talent that helped him
win votes from Russian immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   As he grew older, Barak exhibited a keen intelligence, but it
made him lazy in school and often got him into trouble. Once, Kfir
relates, Barak was called on to read a composition he was supposed
to have written for class. He ``read'' instead from a blank paper.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, his teachers got tired of such pranks. ``They kicked
him out of school because he thought he was too smart, he was
behaving like these lessons were boring for him,'' said Kfir.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Barak received a high school diploma while serving in
the army. Then he went on to study mathematics and physics at
Hebrew University in Jerusalem. A decade later, he earned a
Master's degree in systems analysis from Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, he made a name for himself on his first commando
mission, masterminding the rescue operation of an airliner at Lod
Airport in Tel Aviv that had been hijacked by Palestinians.
Netanyahu was a young soldier under Barak's command.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Barak dressed as a woman and sneaked through the
streets of Beirut to lead the raid against the Palestinians
involved in the Munich massacre.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, he helped plan the raid on Entebbe, Uganda, when
Israeli commandos rescued passengers on a plane hijacked by
Palestinians and Germans.
</P>
<P>
   His political rise has been astoundingly rapid. He was interior
minister in Rabin's government, then foreign minister under Shimon
Peres after Rabin's assassination. In 1997, with roughly two years
political experience under his belt, he won the leadership of the
Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
   While he was daring as a soldier, Barak has been described as
``overly cautious'' as a politician. But such caution could serve
him well when he guides his government toward tough decisions in
negotiations with the Palestinians, observers say.
</P>
<P>
   Most say they expect Barak to carve his own political legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be flexible on some items and on some items he's
going to be a hard-liner,'' said Kfir. ``But he's going to be
genuine, he's going to be honest _ not like Netanyahu.''

   &UR; Rich Cohen &LR; , author of ``Tough Jews'' (Vintage; $13), a study
of Jewish gangsters and the relationships between fathers and sons,
was in San Francisco last week in conjunction with the paperback
publication of the book. We asked him whether Jewish gangsters are
different from other gangsters:
</P>
<P>
   ``They were unique,'' said Cohen, ``in that they really didn't
pass it on to their kids in any way. They raised their kids with
the idea that for them, organized crime was a short cut to the
American dream, to get their kids into law school or medical
school.'' Making a lot of money was a way of cheating ``to even up
the score. For that reason, it became just one generation that
became gangsters. There's no equivalent of  &UR; John &LR; 
 &UR; Gotti Jr. &LR;  among Jewish gangsters. I think that is kind of
unique.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said his understanding of gangster violence in the '20s,
'30s and '40s doesn't give him any insight into violence among
young people today. Gangsters of old were violent to ``get out of
the slums, to help their children.'' The shooters in Littleton,
Colo., by contrast, had already arrived at the middle-class heaven
that old-fashioned gangsters could only imagine in their dreams.
``What happened at Littleton would be more mind-boggling to the
gangsters than anybody.''

some kind of agreement and they don't stick to it, then you maybe
take action. ... Not a single person was killed in war during the

TALLAS AWAITS HIS DAY IN THE SUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ The job is watching, learning, filing it all
away for a future date, but the timeline is invisible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something John Vanbiesbrouck once said stuck with me,'' said
Bruins netminder Rob Tallas. ``As a goalie, he said, you're always
a student of the game. It's not like, click, one day you've got it
all figured out. Instead, you keep learning, and you get better
with age.''
</P>
<P>
   Tallas, now 26 years old, was back filling the tutorial seat
here Tuesday night as teammate Byron Dafoe started his 12th
consecutive playoff game. In three seasons, Tallas has yet to play
a postseason minute. A sometimes equal partner with Dafoe during
the regular season, he has been relegated to understudy _ a job
that requires its own degree of readiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I prepare like I'm going to play,'' said Tallas. ``I take the
morning skate, eat the pregame meal, and get in the nap. I'm not
paid to sit on the bench, take the night off, look around the
stands, and enjoy myself. I take it seriously. It's the only way
you can approach it. I'm paid to be ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be prepared to play the biggest game you could
imagine in your life.''
</P>
<P>
   And you just never know. In Game 5 of the Bruins-Sabres series
Sunday, ex-UMass-Lowell netminder Dwayne Roloson didn't believe
he'd be playing in the Buffalo net. After 40 minutes, however,
coach Lindy Ruff pulled starter Dominik Hasek, and Roloson moved
from backup to front line.
</P>
<P>
   Roloson entered with the Sabres in a 4-1 deficit. By late in the
period, the Sabres had cut the deficit to a goal and were threating
to tie with Roloson pulled for an extra attacker. He was back in
the cage in the final seconds when Jason Allison potted his second
goal of the postseason for the 5-3 final.
</P>
<P>
   On the Boston bench, Tallas couldn't help but feel a touch of
envy toward the 29-year-old Roloson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was excited for him, but at the same time, I'd love to be in
that situation,'' said Tallas, who knows Roloson from their days in
the American Hockey League. ``Sometimes I wonder if, say, we had a
big lead late in the game, maybe Burnsie (coach Pat Burns) would
put me in for five minutes _ I'd love that.''
</P>
<P>
   As Tallas talked to a reporter, Burns happened by the backup
goalie's locker. Kiddingly, he stopped in his tracks and said to
the scribe, ``You're talking to Tallie? Is there something I should
know?''
</P>
<P>
   Not five minutes later, veteran wing Steve Heinze wandered by
and added, ``Geez, they're talking to you?''
</P>
<P>
   All good fun, of course, because Tallas is among the most-liked
players in the room. The coach and his teammates know it's no fun
being the designated sitter, especially at the most exciting time
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   According to Tallas, Burns gave a lot of thought to starting him
in last year's playoffs, following a 3-0 loss to the Capitals in
Game 4 at Boston. After some deliberation, and talking with both
goalies, Burns kept Dafoe on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The right move _ Byron got the shutout,'' said Tallas, ``and
kept me on the sidelines a little longer.''
</P>
<P>
   If Tallas doesn't see a minute in the Boston cage this
postseason, there's a chance he'll never play again for the Bruins.
He undoubtedly will be left exposed for the June expansion draft
that will stock the Atlanta Thrashers. The Bruins don't have to
expose a netminder, but if they chose to protect both Dafoe and
Tallas, they would be able to protect fewer forwards and/or
defensemen. In all likelihood, Tallas will be left available, with
the Bruins prepared to promote John Grahame, their No. 1 netminder
all season in Providence (AHL).
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like I get calls every day about that,'' said Tallas,
signed by Boston as a free agent in '95 and invited to camp as an
extra body with little chance of making it to the big leagues.
``Some people tell me, `Hey, you're going to Atlanta.' Some say
Atlanta will draft me and then trade me right away. Then I hear I'm
staying here. So, I don't know what to expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``What concerns me most, the big thing is to be part of this
time right now. This is the place I want to be, both now and in the
future. When June comes, if it's somewhere else, well, I'll deal
with it at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   When the puck was dropped, Tallas and Roloson were in their
appointed spots, taking up the end of their respective benches.
Dafoe was in the Boston net. The great Hasek, considered the game's
best netminder the past three seasons, fronted the Buffalo cage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm at the age now, 26, I'd like to be a No. 1 goalie in the
next couple of years,'' said Tallas. ``When Byron got here, he was
at the age I am right now, so it worked for him.''
</P>
<P>
   But here in the playoff season of 1999, Tallas remains a student
of the game. The arena has been his classroom, the sheet of ice his
blackboard. One day class will end. But for now, he waits.

JUDGE ALLOWS PARALYZED WOMAN TO DIE; MOTHER FACES MURDER CHARGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Georgette Smith will be allowed to die, as she
wishes, but not until she helps prosecutors build a murder case
against her own mother, who she said has robbed her of the will to
live.
</P>
<P>
   A Florida judge ruled Tuesday that the 42-year-old Ms. Smith,
who was left paralyzed from the neck down in March when her
68-year-old mother shot her in the spine, will be allowed to have
her life support disconnected on Wednesday after 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, doctors will remove from Ms. Smith the ventilator
that is keeping her alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``God, don't leave me this way,'' Ms. Smith pleaded to the judge
in her deposition, saying she understood that her decision was
expected to result in murder charges against her mother, Shirley
Egan. Police say Ms. Egan shot her daughter on March 8 when she
heard her say that she wanted to place her in a nursing home. Ms.
Egan remains in custody.
</P>
<P>
   After Lucerne Medical Center, where she is a patient, refused to
disconnect her life support, Ms. Smith sued to compel them to let
her die. She got what she wanted here Tuesday in Orange County
Court when Judge Richard Conrad ruled that she could be taken off a
ventilator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ms. Smith has made a difficult choice, a choice which she has
the right to make,'' Conrad wrote, in his ruling. ``This court has
found that she is competent to make that choice.''
</P>
<P>
   But the judge ruled that she must wait until 5 p.m. on
Wednesday. That will give prosecutors, who spent 45 minutes
interviewing Ms. Smith in the hospital Tuesday, more time to
interview her and gather evidence in what is expected to be one of
the most unusual legal battles in this state's history.
</P>
<P>
   Although the judge issued an order barring both sides in the
case from speaking about it, prosecutors here have said they will
likely file murder charges against Ms. Egan, who has already been
charged with attempted first-degree murder and aggravated battery
causing great bodily harm.
</P>
<P>
   An Orange County grand jury is expected to decide sometime in
the coming moths if Ms. Egan, a frail, 4-foot-11, 85-pound woman
who is blind in one eye, can be tried for killing her daughter when
it was her daughter's decision to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can do is wink my eyes, wiggle my nose and wiggle my
tongue,'' Ms. Smith said in the written deposition her lawyers
submitted last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't move any other part of my body. I want to die because
I can't live this way,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It is a case of immense sadness, said investigators and family
members, and perhaps the first of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   While there have been many cases in which a criminal's actions
led, after months or years, to suicides or death from lingering
effects from an attack _ leading to murder indictments and
convictions _ it might, legal experts say, be the first in which a
person of sound mind has chosen to be unhooked from life support,
knowing the consequences of the act to herself, and her attacker.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Ms. Smith was shot on March 8 in the Rosewood
Village Apartments in Orlando when she, her boyfriend and Ms. Egan
were talking about placing the elderly woman, who had emphysema and
had recently been hurt in a car crash, in a nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Smith stepped away to get paperwork on a nursing home,
Ms. Egan fired a handgun at her, prosecutors said. It is not clear
how she got the gun.
</P>
<P>
   The bullet lodged in her neck and severed her spine at the
second vertebra. Then Ms. Egan fired the gun again, this time at
Ms. Smith's boyfriend, Larry Videlock, barely missing him, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Ms. Egan has said the elderly woman did not mean to
hurt her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith can speak, but only with great effort, but is unable
to swallow and must be fed by a tube. She has no control of her
bodily functions, and is at risk, doctors said, of pneumonia,
ulcers, infections and bed sores.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said her condition is irreversible, and a psychiatric
evaluation found her to be mentally competent.
</P>
<P>
   Her daughters, Candace Smith, 22, and Joeleen Hill, 19, said it
was their mother's choice to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``She doesn't want to finish her life this way,'' said Candace
Smith in court last week.
</P>
<P>
   Their mother's death, if prosecutors follow through on their
plans to file murder charges, will be the beginning of a legal
struggle over intent, and responsibility: Did Ms. Egan end her
daughter's life, even though it was her daughter's decision to die?
</P>
<P>
   David Orentlicher, a professor of law at Indiana University and
co-director of the Center for Law and Health, said there is a long
history of murder charges and convictions stemming from crimes that
did not immediately result in death. In the late 1800s, a man was
injured in the leg by another man, refused to have his leg
amputated when gangrene set in, and died. His attacker was
convicted of murder.
</P>
<P>
   And in the 1930s, a woman who was raped later committed suicide
because she could not live with the shame. Her attacker was
convicted of murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``This looks pretty clear,'' said Orenlicher. ``The law points
in that direction'' of a successful prosecution for murder in the
Florida case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, are they doing something that is so
unreasonable that it's not fair to blame to shooter,'' he said.
``In this case, we've got a well-recognized reason for refusing
treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Some legal experts disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be held responsible for someone else's death unless
you cause that death,'' said Peter Arenella, a professor of
criminal law at the University of California in Los Angeles. ``The
daughter made a conscious decision to end her life, and should be
held to be the actual cause of death. It would be difficult for
prosecutors to persuade jurors that the attack caused her death.''
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Brafman, a prominent New York City defense lawyers,
agrees. ``It would be a very difficult legal theory,'' he said of
the prosecution. ``Because an argument could be made that an
affirmative decision to end the life is a not a direct consequence
of the shooting, but the result of an intervening force.''

SERBS OPEN THE BORDER AND EXPEL KOSOVARS TO MACEDONIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By DAVID ROHDE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACE, Macedonia _ Emerging from the darkness without warning, a
mile-long column of 80 tractors carrying between 1,000 and 1,500
Kosovo Albanian men, women and children abruptly arrived at this
remote border crossing at 8:15 p.m. Tuesday, aid workers said.
</P>
<P>
   Another group of more than 900 refugees crossed the border
earlier Tuesday afternoon. Together, they made up the largest
exodus of Albanians from Kosovo into Macedonia in 10 days. And the
exhausted refugees arriving here report that Yugoslav forces have
begun a new wave of mass expulsions in southeastern Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees who arrived Tuesday afternoon said the Serbian
police were expelling Albanians from the Kosovo town of Urosevac
and the villages of Zlatar and Drobesh _ communities where
thousands of people already forced from their homes in other towns
and villages had taken shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of Albanians from across Kosovo who have been
turned back from the Macedonian border by Yugoslav forces in the
last 10 days are believed to be hiding in southeastern Kosovo
waiting for a chance to flee.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav forces have followed a pattern of expelling thousands
of Albanians from Kosovo and then closing the border with no
warning. The reason for the pattern is not known, but Western
diplomats here have speculated that the Serbs clear out certain
areas for military purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees arriving Tuesday from Urosevac reported that more and
more Yugoslav Army units were occupying houses, schools, mosques
and even hospitals in the town in an effort to avoid being visible
targets for NATO air attacks.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the refugees said, the police went from house to
house in some neighborhoods and ordered Albanians to flee,
prompting several hundred people to board a train to Macedonia
Tuesday morning. After not permitting people to cross the border
for most of the last 10 days, Yugoslav border guards allowed all
900 people on the train to cross.
</P>
<P>
   Muharem Raci, 58, said he fled from Urosevac Tuesday after a
terrifying attack by Serbian police officers. ``We came because
they nearly killed us yesterday,'' he said. ``They came to our
house and put a machine gun to my throat and threatened to kill
me.''
</P>
<P>
   In Drobesh and Zlatar, two villages roughly 10 miles east of
Urosevac, Yugoslav soldiers surrounded the communities Tuesday
morning and ordered everyone to leave, refugees said.
</P>
<P>
   In Drobesh, the refugees said, the soldiers ordered all
residents to gather in the center of the village. There, the men
and women were separated. While the Serbs shouted taunts of, ``You
asked for NATO, go to NATO!'' they robbed the women and beat the
men.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 60 villagers were loaded into a bus that ferried them to
the border Tuesday afternoon, the refugees said. Hundreds of others
were left behind. The refugees who made it to the border said they
did not know what happened to the others.
</P>
<P>
   Xhezide Qitaku, 27, who was among those expelled from Drobesh
Tuesday, said the soldiers had arrested her two brothers and
dragged them out of the house where they were staying. Her family,
she said, fled to Drobesh eight months ago from the Drenica region
of Kosovo, the birthplace of the Albanian separatist rebel group,
the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   When she went out of the house to protest after her brothers
were seized, she said, the soldiers told Ms. Qitaku that her
brothers were already dead. When she left the house a second time,
she said, they beat her.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kicked me two times,'' she said. ``They said I was KLA
and had to be beaten.''
</P>
<P>
   Macedonian police officers prevented reporters from speaking
with the refugees arriving here from Zlatar Tuesday night. Aid
organizations here say they worry that food supplies inside Kosovo
may be dwindling. But Gavin Newton, an aid worker with the group
Action Against Hunger, said the refugees arriving Tuesday night
were cold, hungry and tired, but not malnourished.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are hungry, but they're still in generally good
condition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Astrid van Genderen Stort, a border monitor here from the U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees, said she believed that large
numbers of refugees could be again headed toward Macedonia and
could again arrive with little warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people on the tractors said they didn't know what was
behind them,'' she said Tuesday night. ``I don't know when it's
going to stop.''

ABC CHANGES INCLUDE MOVIES ON SATURDAYS, SIX NEW SERIES IN FALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABC, famous for placing good shows on Saturdays and then
canceling them after nobody watched, will address the problem next
fall by eliminating all series on Saturday nights in favor of
three-hour movies.
</P>
<P>
   The network on Tuesday said it will introduce six new shows next
fall, three comedies and three dramas. It also will move ``Dharma &AMP;
Greg'' from 8 to 9 p.m. on Wednesdays and ``Spin City'' from 9 to 8
p.m. on Tuesdays.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a summary of ABC's new prime-time series:
</P>
<P>
   Snoops. The latest from David E. Kelley is about private eyes
who bend the rules on the road to justice. Best character name
(from Kelley, the hockey fan): Glenn Hall, played by Gina Gershon.
</P>
<P>
   Once and Again. ``NYPD Blue'' always starts its season late, so
this romantic drama will begin in the Tuesday-at-10 slot. After
that? ABC isn't saying. It's about two divorced parents trying to
re-learn dating skills. Best character name: Slim pickings here,
but we'll go with Zoe.
</P>
<P>
   Oh Grow Up. Three guys, a girl and no pizza place in this
ensemble comedy. One of the guys is gay; the girl is the daughter
of one of the guys. Best character name: Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   Wasteland. Hourlong drama about six twentysomethings trying to
make it in New York City. Best character name: Tossup between
Dawnie, a grad student, and Vandy, a struggling musician.
</P>
<P>
   Then Came You. ABC calls this a romantic comedy with a twist.
She: a 34-year-old book editor. He: a 24-year-old room-service
waiter. Best character name: Aidan, the waiter.
</P>
<P>
   Odd Man Out. From the writers of ``There's Something About
Mary'' comes this half-hour comedy about a 14-year-old boy living
with his mom, his aunt and his three sisters. Best character name:
ABC only revealed the name of the male character, Andrew, but two
of the actresses have neat names: Natalia Cigliuti and Marina
Malota.

SERBS POSITIONING TROOPS FOR GROUND WAR, INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS
SAY

<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Anticipating that NATO may eventually launch
a ground offensive, Yugoslav army brigades have been stationed
along the likely attack routes from Macedonia and Albania and are
trying to fortify the border, according to allied officials.
</P>
<P>
   The positioning of the Serbian forces represents a marked shift
in Yugoslavia's military strategy from overseeing the expulsion of
ethnic Albanians from Kosovo to preparing for a prolonged battle,
and focusing on blocking incursions by NATO troops as well as rebel
fighters of the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   It also signals that while two months of allied air strikes has
weakened Serb forces, it has not broken their will.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now the army is worried about defending the major passes
into Kosovo,'' an allied intelligence official said. ``Most of the
army is committed to digging in, mining and fortifying.''
</P>
<P>
   With the British again urging NATO to consider a land attack to
hasten an end to the crisis and return the refugees before the
winter, the Yugoslav army's preparations complicate the allied
debate.
</P>
<P>
   Even Britain draws the line at sending in NATO troops in the
face of a well-armed, organized Serb resistance. London has said it
will support a ground attack if air raids over the next several
months manage to weaken Yugoslav troops to the point that they pose
only scattered opposition.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO air strikes are taking a heavy toll on the Serbian
military, there are no indications that the Yugoslav forces are
about to crack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a conscript army, and there is a pretty unhappy group of
soldiers out there right now,'' the intelligence official said.
``Most of these guys should have been released in December and they
did not get paid last month because the paymaster did not get
through.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the bottom line is that you still got an intact army out
there,'' he added. ``Are they ready to mutiny? No. Are they ready
to desert in mass? No. Do they feel good about what they have done?
Probably the officers do. And they are digging in.''
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons why Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic's military commanders are making preparations to fight on
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav strategy reflects anxiety over the 13,000 British,
French and German troops in Macedonia. They are part of a larger
NATO force that is being assembled for a potential peacekeeping
mission in Kosovo, but they could serve in an invasion force as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade may also be aiming to gain negotiating leverage with
NATO by setting the stage for the appearance of bloody ground war.
That was a tactic Saddam Hussein used before the 1991 Persian Gulf
war, but with little success.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it is a response to the Kosovo Liberation Army, which
is still infiltrating the province from Albania. Despite its
assaults against the ethnic Albanian population in Kosovo, the
Serbian military has yet to deal a mortal blow the KLA _ its
original objective.
</P>
<P>
   Sealing the border with Macedonia has become a top priority of
the Serbian military. Yugoslav army troops have been laying mines,
trying to block attack routes from Skopje and Kumanov in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   They have also positioned themselves to defend the route from
Skopje through the Kacanik Valley to Podujevo in Kosovo. It is the
most direct approach to the heart of the province, and the Yugoslav
army has put three brigades _ a force of about 12,000 troops _ in
its path.
</P>
<P>
   NATO intelligence says the Yugoslav army has its 243rd Brigade
near the border town of Deneral Jankovic. Behind it is the 252nd
Brigade, an armored unit, which is stationed between Urosevac and
Pristina. The 211th Brigade is in the rear, near Podujevo.
</P>
<P>
   ``They believe NATO is coming,'' the allied intelligence
official said.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian border has also been a major worry for Yugoslav
generals because KLA partisans have been infiltrating through seven
mountain passes along that frontier.
</P>
<P>
   There are between 6,000 and 10,000 KLA fighters inside Kosovo,
NATO estimates. They are not only operating from western Kosovo but
from mountainous areas in north central and south central areas of
the province.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav military is ``desperate to close that border and
knows it cannot win unless it does so,'' the NATO intelligence
officer said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has an Army task force of 5,000, equipped with
Apache helicopters and surface-to-surface missiles in Albania. So
far, however, President Clinton has not given Gen. Wesley Clark,
NATO's supreme commander, permission to send the Apaches into
combat against Serb troops near Albania.
</P>
<P>
   The southwestern Kosovo city of Djakovica, the scene of some of
the most intensive assaults against ethnic Albanians, is a key town
near the Albanian border. Trying to seal off the Albanian border,
the Yugoslav military has deployed the 125th Brigade north of
Djakovica.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the 549th Brigade is hunkered down to the south between
Djakovica and Prizren, another town in southwestern Kosovo that
sits on a major route from Albania. To fortify his position, the
Serb commander in Prizren has dragooned civilians, put them in
military uniforms and ordered them to dig trenches.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav commanders also have a reserve of 13,000 to 15,000
infantry troops in nearby towns in Montenegro and Serbia, which
could be drawn on in the event of a NATO attack.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)  &LR;  With the army concentrating on
countering a NATO land attack, the special police from the Yugoslav
interior minister have been assigned the primary task of
maintaining control of central Kovoso.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav army, however, has been been involved in some
fighting against the KLA in the Kosovo interior. It has laid a
minefield on a road that runs north from Pristina to Podujevo to
try to box in KLA forces in the north central part of the province.
</P>
<P>
   There is no formal cooperation between the KLA and NATO, but the
allied air strikes have made it more difficult for Serbs to fight
the Albanian guerrillas. When the Serbs try to gather their tanks
and artillery to attack the Albanians, NATO planes bomb them.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OPTIONAL TRIM)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   While the Serbian forces have not cracked, there are signs of
low morale within their ranks and even unrest in Serbia, NATO says.
</P>
<P>
   Allied officials said today that there were two demonstrations
in recent days, one at Alexandrovac where 1,000 people tried to
prevent the departure of reservists to Kosovo. At Krusevac, 3,000
angry protesters demanded that reservists in Kosovo be sent home.
</P>
<P>
   Some intelligence analysts, in fact, believe that Belgrade's
much publicized announcement of a limited troop pull out may have
been directed as much at reassuring its own military as it was on
public opinion in the West. The aim, they say, was to assure its
Serb troops in Kosovo that their ordeal in Kosovo will not go on
indefinitely.

BEAUTIFUL YOUNG ACTRESS SLIPS INTO ROLE OF LIFETIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARLA MATZER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When the two-part TV film ``Cleopatra'' begins
airing Sunday &UR;  &LR; on ABC, viewers are sure to be asking one question:
Who's the girl?
</P>
<P>
   The queen of the Nile is played by Leonor Varela, an exotic and
beautiful half-Chilean, half-French actress making her U.S.
television debut. Leonardo DiCaprio fans may have seen her in ``Man
in the Iron Mask'' last year; she's somewhat better-known overseas,
from her work in European independent films and South American
television productions.
</P>
<P>
   Previous on-screen Cleos Claudette Colbert and Elizabeth Taylor
were already well-known stars when they played the famous ruler and
seducer of men. Now, Varela is feeling the heat generated by her
sexy new role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day, there's a script arriving,'' Varela sighed happily
in a phone interview. ``I haven't made a choice yet about my next
project, though I'd like to do something with some action. I did
some of my own stunts (for ``Cleopatra'').''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Varela lives in Paris. She's previously lived in
Chile, Costa Rica and in Colorado, where her French father's work
as a research scientist brought the family for several years. Her
English has a slight French accent, though in the movie, the accent
is fairly straight-on American. Thanks to her upbringing, Varela is
fluent in Spanish, French and English.
</P>
<P>
   On the phone, as in ``Cleopatra,'' her voice is a combination of
smooth, seductive tones and no-nonsense straightforwardness. The
effect isn't lost on men.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen,''
enthused Billy Zane (most recently seen in ``Titanic''), who plays
Marc Antony to Varela's Cleopatra, ``but she operates from a place
of amazing humility and grace. I'm mad about her.''
</P>
<P>
   Varela also admires Zane, as well as her other co-star, Timothy
Dalton, who played Julius Ceasar. ``I really enjoyed working with
them. The shoot was like giving birth,'' Varela says with a laugh,
``but I enjoyed every single minute of it. I think particularly
between Billy Zane and me, there was an immediate understanding, an
easy attraction that just grew during the whole shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the story's obvious emphasis on sex and intrigue,
Varela, along with the TV movie's creators, stresses that this
version of ``Cleopatra'' is a modern look at the Eyptian ruler.
Director Frank Roddam _ whose previous films include
``Quadrophenia'' and ``K-2'' _ said, ``In the past ... (Cleopatra
has) always been defined as a scheming, conniving woman. If a woman
had power, it meant she'd got it through some nefarious means. I
think that's a very old-fashioned notion.''
</P>
<P>
   Varela points out that every ``Cleopatra,'' whether it was made
in 1934, 1963 or 1998, ``reflects what was going on at that time.
``The '60s version was about Taylor's stardom, the paparazzi
surrounding her ... our version is more about what's happening
today. Cleopatra is pictured as a woman of power and a woman of
faith. She has a view of what the world should be like.''
</P>
<P>
   The tale is set against a backdrop so impressive that even
Dalton, who twice played James Bond, was amazed. ``I have to tell
you the first day on the set was one of the most exciting days I've
ever had in my career,'' said Dalton. ``I mean, I've never worked
on a set that's a quarter-mile long. Its size, its grandeur, to be
surrounded by a thousand Roman soldiers and Egyptians _ it was
really fabulous.''
</P>
<P>
   Morocco was the location for the fantastic desert set, which ABC
says cost $2.5 million and was ``one of the largest built anywhere,
for any movie.'' Varela says the set and the country itself
provided inspiration during the six weeks they shot there before
moving to a sound stage in England.
</P>
<P>
   ``Morocco is a very spiritual place,'' says Varela, ``and,
surrounded by that set and all those extras, it wasn't hard to feel
like a queen.''
</P>
<P>
   Varela was happy that many scenes featured a more intimate look
at Cleopatra, though. On days when she had to be in full queenly
regalia, makeup could take up to four hours. When her scenes called
for her to be lounging in bed with a lover or scheming in private,
she spent only half that time in the makeup chair.
</P>
<P>
   The actress admits that she's in the enviable but slightly
bittersweet position of wondering whether she'll get another role
that measures up to the queen of Egypt. ``I did worry a bit about
finding another role as good,'' said Varela, a little wistfully.
``But Cleopatra is a lifetime kind of part. Now, I think I need to
do something a little different.'' &UR;  &QL;

 BRUSSELS: on indefinitely.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   None of this is likely to mean that President Milosevic is about
to yield to NATO's demands or that the conflict will soon come to
an end. In Belgrade Tuesday, a foreign ministry official said
Yugoslavia is ready to discuss a deal to end the conflict. But it
is far from clear whether Milosevic is close to meeting NATO's
terms.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs, however, are not the only ones trying to seal off the
frontier. Seeking to weaken the Serb military and drive it out of
Kosovo, NATO has tried to cut the Serb troops in Kosovo from their
supply lines from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strategy is to cut this guy off in Kosovo and impede them
from moving supplies from the middle of the country to the south of
the country,'' Gen. John Jumper, the head of the U.S. Air Force in
Europe, said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   Not only will that increase the pressure on Belgrade to yield to
NATO's demands, NATO believes, but it is likely to prompt the Serb
troops to come out of their hiding places, making them vulnerable
to NATO air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   But shutting off the supplies has not been easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosovo is about 50 percent cut off,'' another senior military
officer said. ``There are innumerable roads.''
</P>
<P>
   Allied planes have destroyed the two rail lines to Kovoso, a
major setback for the Yugoslav army, which is heavily dependent on
rail traffic. The only functioning rail line is between Pristina
and Deneral Jankovic, which the Serbs have used to shuttle refugees
back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has also pummeled the roads and bridges from Mitrovica in
northern Kosovo to Raska, Serbia, all but cutting off that attack
route. Bridges between Podujevo and Nis in Serbia have also been
attacked, though Serb units have still been able to get supplies
through.
</P>
<P>
   With the allies trying to avoid attacks on Montenegro, which is
part of Yugoslavia but whose pro-Western government is striving to
stay independent of Belgrade's control, some of the routes to that
region are open as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a complex mission and will take patience,'' Jumper said
of the air campaign. ``It will take some time to get the fielded
forces to the point where we have a decisive impact on his ability
and willingness to pursue these atrocities.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how long the war might continue, Jumper gave a terse
response: ``months.''

 How to Get VC Firms' Attention
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Peter Sinton &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I would like to start an Internet business and am
interested in strategies for getting noticed by venture capital
firms?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  It isn't easy, especially if you don't have an
entrepreneurial track record or contacts in the investment world.
Good ideas are not enough. Even a brilliantly crafted business plan
may not get you through the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtually no one looks at business plans that come in over the
transom,'' said Mark Radcliffe, a senior partner at the law firm
Gray Cary Ware &AMP; Freidenrich, which caters to venture firms and the
companies they back. If you don't have an in with VCs, he suggests
consulting with a law, accounting or consulting firm that does and
let them help with the introductions.
</P>
<P>
   It's often possible to get a first meeting free with these
professionals. But success is certainly not guaranteed. Radcliffe
said he referred three entrepreneurs to VCs in the past two weeks
but turned away five others.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't hear back from professionals you've contacted, it
probably means they don't think much of your idea.
</P>
<P>
   You might have better luck running your idea past the Service
Corps of Retired Executives or the growing number of private
wealthy investor groups, known as angels.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure what sort of Internet concept you have, but there
are a lot of ideas out there and yours better be fresh and have
some real potential.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Braziel, chairman of Altra Energy Technologies of
Houston, says, ``You better know the industry you are serving.''
His firm delivers gas, electricity and liquid fuels over the
Internet and has raised $47.5 million of private equity.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, he observes, ``The Internet is just pipes.'' That
means you can't just put information on a bulletin board and expect
to make money. Braziel stresses the importance of ``helping your
customers be more profitable, save money, or both.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news for those seeking venture capital is that there is
plenty available. Red Herring magazine noted at its information
technology investing conference at Squaw Valley yesterday that 139
new funds were formed last year with $17.3 billion committed to
them by institutional investors. That was up 47.5 percent from the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
   The not-so-good news is that venture capital investors are
betting a lot more money on each of their investments and are
therefore less tolerant of mistakes. At the same time, the pressure
to get from idea to product to market more quickly has never been
so intense.
</P>
<P>
   How to Be an E-CEO
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does it take to be a great e-commerce CEO?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: Ross Garber, founder and chairman of Vignette of Austin,
Texas, should know. The customer relationship management software
company he started four years ago went public in February and now
is worth $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the Red Herring conference, Garber said the days of
product-based marketing plans are over. Now it's essential to have
a great business model. ``It's like playing chess instead of
checkers'' he noted, and the model is constantly changing.
</P>
<P>
   He also recommends creating a company that has soul. For
Vignette, whose customers include Charles Schwab and US West, this
means realizing it's important to satisfy not just employees, but
their families. After particularly arduous projects, Vignette sends
cookie bouquets to spouses.
</P>
<P>
   Even though you may be shy, as Garber was in school, learn to
stand out. To separate yourself from the pack, you need to lead a
crusade.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, don't expect entrepreneurship to be a panacea. Garber
thought it would be when, at age 12, he got his first Commodore Pet
computer and envisioned becoming an entrepreneur. He thought he'd
be like the Pied Piper and lead folks out of the woods.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he recalls his first 2-1/2 years as CEO were ``the
hardest, most miserable thing I've ever done in my life.'' The
responsibility for other peoples' lives and livelihoods is what
worried Garber most. Nine months ago, he gave up the CEO job and is
now happier focusing on strategic issues and coaching.

CLEMENS WILL SIT OUT THIS SERIES AGAINST RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- There was no sadness detectable in his voice. Roger
Clemens in a Yankee uniform was just another visiting ballplayer in
Fenway Park vowing to be ready when it is his turn to face the Red
Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens made another return to Fenway Tuesday night, his first
time here in a Yankee uniform, and drew a crowd. But the drama of
the moment was diminished when it was confirmed that he will not
face his former team Thursday. Instead, the righthander will return
from a stint on the disabled list Friday in Chicago. If all goes
well, Clemens and the Red Sox should meet next Wednesday, in Yankee
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees cited weather forecasts _ which call for rain in the
next two days _ as a major factor in holding back Clemens, who has
been on the DL since April 28 with a strained left hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I badly want to pitch,'' declared Clemens. ``I want to pitch
first and then go out there and be effective and be healthy. That's
my main concern. If that is also their concern, so be it. It would
have been fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens has had fun here before in a visiting uniform. He won Cy
Young Awards each of the last two years with the Toronto Blue Jays,
beating the Red Sox once each year. In his first time back to
Boston, July of 1997, he struck out 16 batters in a 3-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   His trade to New York this spring was another jolt to Boston
fans, but if they wish to boo him, they probably won't get a chance
until the end of July.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been back before and wearing a visiting uniform,'' said
Clemens. ``So I don't think things are that different. It's always
exciting to come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``But around here (with New York), it's the big picture that
matters. You work toward August and September to get yourself in
position to do well. I won't pitch any harder than I would at any
other stadium. There won't be that many more distractions here than
there would be in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens was deft at avoiding the sensitive questions. He would
not address his Red Sox days. In that he was firm. But he did wax
poetic about being a Yankee and playing for a team that may be able
to deliver the World Series title that has eluded him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting on the pinstripes is everything I expected from spring
training on,'' he said. ``I'm back where the history means
something. It's everything you expect. I'm not satisfied, but I'm
very happy. I just need to get back out there, know that my legs
are under me and I can be healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I take the mound, guys are going to come at me for what
I've done in the game. Or what I did over the years. Also, what
this team accomplished last year. Everybody comes at you extremely
hard. You notice that from teams you didn't expect to put up a big
fight. They put up a great challenge to you.''
</P>
<P>
   As a Yankee, Clemens added, he is back in a part of the baseball
world where the fans count.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to perform and get people excited,'' he said. ``In
Boston and New York, they make their own excitement. If you do
well, it's great. If not, they let you know it, too. It's fun to be
in the middle of it.''
</P>
<P>
   With the All-Star Game in Boston this summer, Clemens has
another opportunity to pitch before the Fenway faithful in
pinstripes, though the injury and a slow start (2-0, 5.47 ERA) will
hurt his chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for the All-Star Game, if it happens, great,'' said
Clemens. ``If not, I have some other plans. My boys have some games
planned and obviously I will be doing something with them.''

 Cisco to Help Small Firms Get Net Savvy
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Deborah Solomon &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
While Internet startups and ``dot com'' companies dominate the
news, many smaller businesses still aren't participating in the
information technology revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Eyeing a potential new customer base, Cisco Systems is working
to get small and medium-size businesses online and technologically
savvy.
</P>
<P>
   The San Jose networking giant will announce today that it is
working with the San Francisco office of the Small Business
Association and the Small Business Development Center to help
companies use the Internet to conduct everyday business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hope is to familiarize small business with the benefits of
doing business over the Internet,'' said Gary Marshall, economic
development specialist with the SBA.
</P>
<P>
   The SBA is working with Cisco to help small companies develop,
design and maintain Web sites. Cisco is providing free 10-megabyte
Web sites and Internet accounts to 250 small Bay Area businesses
that complete a series of free SBA courses. The classes focus on
areas such as e-commerce and doing business on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco also is developing a series of free courses to be held
around the Bay Area in conjunction with the Small Business
Development Center, a one-stop shop for small businesses partially
funded by the SBA. The seminars, which start next month, aim to
help companies learn to use the Internet as a money-saving tool and
a way to maintain customer relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great opportunity to educate small businesses about
how technology can help them save money and operate their business
more efficiently,'' said Eugene Lee, a vice president in Cisco's
small and medium business division.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a great opportunity for Cisco.
</P>
<P>
   As these small businesses become more familiar with the Internet
and start to migrate their business online, Cisco can benefit from
the relationships it's formed.
</P>
<P>
   The companies potentially could turn to Cisco to buy the routers
and other networking gear they'll need to maintain a Web presence
and conduct business on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to establish ourselves as a leading provider to small
businesses,'' said Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco traditionally has focused on large, corporate customers,
but there is a finite number of those companies. There are between
6.5 million and 13.5 million small and medium-size businesses in
the United States, representing a new, lucrative opportunity for
Cisco and other networking companies, industry watchers said.

THE WB ROLLS OUT SIX NEW SHOWS AND ADDS FRIDAY TO ITS LINEUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Acting more and more like the big boys, The WB adds a sixth
night of programming next fall: Fridays. And, while the network of
Michigan J. Frog is still aiming at the hearts of young viewers,
some of its new programming for the 1999-2000 season demonstrates
an interest in people beyond their teens. But not too far beyond.
</P>
<P>
   The WB on Tuesday said it will introduce six new prime-time
shows next season, all but one of them of the hourlong variety. It
also will move ``Felicity'' to Sundays, so the new series ``Angel''
can follow its stablemate, ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' on
Tuesdays. ``Charmed'' will move from Wednesdays to Thursdays.
</P>
<P>
   A summary of The WB's new fall series:
</P>
<P>
   Jack &AMP; Jill. A one-hour romantic comedy about a woman named
Jack, as in Jacqueline Barrett (Amelia Heinle), and a man named
Jill, as in David Jillefsky (Ivan Sergei). Best character name:
Can't do much better when she's Jack and he's Jill.
</P>
<P>
   Safe Harbor. Family drama featuring Gregory Harrison as the
sheriff _ and the widowed father of four boys _ in a seaside
Florida town. Best character name: Grandma (Rue McClanahan), owner
of the motel where the sheriff and his boys live.
</P>
<P>
   Angel. Hourlong spinoff from ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer.''
Buffy's boyfriend, Angel (David Boreanaz), takes on the forces of
evil in Los Angeles. Best character name: ``Buffy'' transferee
Cordelia Chase, only because her real name, Charisma Carpenter, is
even better.
</P>
<P>
   Roswell. One-hour sci-fi drama about aliens trying to pass as
normal teens in Roswell, N.M. Best character name: Isabel
(Katherine Heigl), one of the kids orphaned after the crash of an
alien spaceship.
</P>
<P>
   Popular. One-hour comedy/drama about teens and the quest to be
cool. Best character name: Actually, it's the school they attend,
Jacqueline Kennedy High School.
</P>
<P>
   The Downtowners. Half-hour animated comedy about teens and
twenty-somethings living in the big city. Best character name:
Posey Tyler (voiced by Vicki Lewis).
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that some of the foregoing will crash and burn before
we've put up our 2000 calendars, The WB also announced three
midseason series. One is the comedy ``Zoe, Duncan, Jack &AMP; Jane,''
which premiered this season but isn't on the fall schedule. The
others are ``D.C.,'' a drama co-produced by Dick Wolf (``Law &AMP;
Order'') about recent college graduates making a living in the
nation's capital, and ``Baby Blues,'' an animated comedy about
suburban parenting based on the syndicated comic strip.
</P>
<P>

JAPAN MOVES TO BAN CHILD PROSTITUTION AND PORNOGRAPHY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The Japanese Parliament on Tuesday enacted a law that
aims at banning child prostitution and child pornography.
</P>
<P>
   Its passage was a victory for international law enforcement
officials, who have long been critical of Japan's lax laws against
sex with children and child pornography, and for a band of women
legislators here who have fought for two years to overcome strong
opposition to the law on the ground that it would inhibit free
speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very happy,'' said Mayumi Moriyama, a veteran lawmaker
who coaxed Japan's fractious opposition parties into signing on to
the bill. ``After two years of work, really hard work, we've done
it, and I'm very pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   The law, which is to go into effect later this year, punishes
those found guilty of paying for sex with children 17 and younger,
and bans the sale, distribution, production, possession, import and
export of child pornography.
</P>
<P>
   Current laws are vague and require a victim to file a complaint
before police can take action. Producers of child pornography have
found it easy to evade existing laws by avoiding pictures that show
intercourse and blacking out eyes and portions of some body parts.
</P>
<P>
   Newsstands and bookstores here stock a selection of magazines
featuring glossy photos of little girls in swimsuits or short
skirts, with slightly suggestive close-ups of thighs, crotches and
buttocks not quite completely covered by panties.
</P>
<P>
   There are also more blatant magazines with titles like
``Lolita'' and ``After School Play Mates'' _ featuring pictures of
girls who appear to range in age from 5 or 6 to women in their late
teens and early 20s in various states of dress and undress _ that
are fairly easy to buy in bookstores near red-light districts.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese companies have arranged tours to Asian countries whose
overriding aim is to introduce men to children with whom they can
have sex, although more stringent laws against child prostitution
in countries like Thailand and the Philippines have made such trips
rare.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the explosive growth of the Internet, with its
ability to facilitate wide distribution of images, that put Japan
on the map as the leading source of child pornography. Interpol,
the international police agency, has estimated that between 70
percent and 80 percent of the child pornography available on the
Internet came from Japanese sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some figures say 80 percent and some say 20 percent; we really
don't know a good way of measuring it,'' said Keiji Goto, an
official at the National Police Agency who campaigned on behalf of
more stringent laws. ``But it is sure that Japan is the No. 1
provider of child pornography on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign parents in Tokyo were complaining that their children
were stumbling across child pornography when searching for web
sites related to ``Japanese teens'' or ``Japanese dolls,''
according to the Rev. Jacques La Pointe, a Franciscan priest who
campaigned vigorously to raise awareness of the issue among
Japanese policy-makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disgusting what you can find on the Internet without even
trying,'' said Jacques, who was recently transferred to a diocese
in New York but only after wrangling a meeting to discuss the issue
with Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
   Junko Miyamoto, of the Japanese branch of the international
watchdog group End Prostitution in Asian Tourism, has worked on the
campaign to strengthen Japanese laws against the sexual
exploitation of children for the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   She welcomed the passage of the law but cautioned that while it
will make child prostitution and pornography more difficult in
Japan, it is full of loopholes that were the inevitable result of
the battle to get the bill through the Parliament. The Democratic
Party, Japan's largest opposition party, raised several objections
to the bill, contending that it would infringe on freedom of speech
and expression, although it ultimately signed on to make it law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have just cleared the first step, and it was a great first
step,'' Ms. Miyamoto said. ``But now we must make sure it is
enforced strictly to protect children from commercial sexual
abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   She declined to identify the law's weaknesses, saying to do so
would be to help those seeking to exploit children. ``All I can say
is that it's not enough to stop abuse on the Internet, that's for
sure,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Moriyama said the law would be reviewed in three years with
an eye toward strengthening it. ``We will not stop our efforts to
work on it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Those in the business of distributing child pornography have
clearly scaled back their operations. A Japanese web site that
Jacques had been monitoring recently closed down, posting a notice
saying that it unwittingly may have distributed sexual pictures of
children under 18.
</P>
<P>
   Masashi Sekiguchi, who works for a major publisher of child and
adult pornography, said the law would definitely have a negative
impact on the business, which was already suffering. Strict laws
against child prostitution and pornography in countries like
Thailand and the Philippines, where many of the photos used in
magazines featuring child pornography are shot, have made it
difficult to obtain pictures of young girls.
</P>
<P>
   A gently smiling nude Asian girl, who looked to be 11 or 12
years old, stared up from the cover of a magazine on his coffee
table. He said most of the pictures in the magazine were taken four
or five years ago, before strict laws were enacted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally object to making money by the exploitation of
nude children,'' Sekiguchi said. ``But our company orders us to
produce such books because they are very profitable.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he also worried that the law would curtail the
publication of innocent photos of children. ``Look at this,''
Sekiguchi said, pointing to a photo of a fully clothed little
Japanese girl licking a popsicle stick. ``I think this is simply
lovely and beautiful. You can't associate it with a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Rei Sayama, the pen name of a writer who writes pornographic
articles and stories, said he worried that the suppression of child
pornography would give rise to more violent crimes against
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say that Japan is the only country in the world
where child pornography is legal,'' Sayama said. ``I understand
that must seem strange to foreign eyes, but there is a reason for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   He contended that in Japanese culture, there is no historical
sense of criminality in child pornography. ``The typical Western
attitude is to resist the idea of having young girls as sex
objects,'' he said. ``But over several hundreds of years of
Japanese culture and history, little girls have been accepted as
sex objects. It's part of the cultural heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   Sekiguchi objected. ``Japan hasn't until recently had a notion
that children could be sex objects,'' he said. ``Until recently,
most little children _ unless they were children of rich farmers _
would run around almost naked during the summer, and adults never
looked at them as sex objects.''

TIFFANY GLASS EXPERT ACCUSED OF TRAFFICKING WITH MAUSOLEUM THIEF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., N.Y., Ohio)   (bl)  
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Alastair Duncan has long been regarded as one of the
world's leading experts on Tiffany stained glass. A former
consultant to Christie's auction house here, he has written books
and articles on the subject, and has advised the FBI in its
investigations into thefts involving the valuable objects.
</P>
<P>
   But federal authorities in Manhattan said it was Duncan who
profited from some of the most brazen thefts of the stained glass,
as they accused him on Tuesday of conspiring with others to buy
Tiffany windows from a grave robber and offering the glass for sale
overseas for hundreds of thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, the authorities said, Duncan bought a 9-foot
Tiffany stained-glass window, knowing that it had been stolen from
a mausoleum at a Brooklyn cemetery. He then arranged for it to be
sold to a buyer in Japan for $219,000, the authorities said. In
another case, he was accused of trying to sell another Tiffany
stained-glass window that had been stolen from a cemetery in
Valhalla.
</P>
<P>
   His arrest highlights what cemetery experts say has become a
rising concern around the country: the vulnerability of expensive
art objects that families have used to decorate mausoleums for more
than a century.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan, 57, stood silently in U.S. District Court in Manhattan
on Tuesday as a magistrate ordered him released on $100,000 bond.
Duncan said he had no comment, and his lawyer, Peter Vigeland, said
only, ``We look forward to the opportunity to contest these charges
in court.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a national problem,'' said Meg Winslow, curator of
historical collections at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge,
Mass., who cited the lack of security in many cemeteries, the
growing market for the valuable glass and other commemorative
objects, and the failure of cemeteries to document the art objects
that adorn their mausoleums.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so easy to steal, to sell, and to get away with it,'' Ms.
Winslow said.
</P>
<P>
   Another expert, Katie Karrick, who publishes a newsletter on
cemetery art and history called ``Tomb With a View,'' said that
Tiffany stained-glass windows have been particularly coveted by
thieves since the 1960s, when the market in the valuable glass
began to heat up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been to cemeteries around the country,'' she said, ``and
every time I see a mausoleum that has a blank window in back, just
filled in with clear glass, I assume first that there was once a
valuable window in there that's been stolen.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Karrick, who also works as a historian the Lake View
Cemetery in Cleveland, whose chapel was designed by Louis Comfort
Tiffany, said she consulted with Duncan some time ago about the
work of the famous craftsman and that he could not have been more
generous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never heard anything but good things about him,'' Ms.
Karrick said.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan once spoke about the popularity of Tiffany stained-glass
windows in cemeteries, explaining in a newspaper interview that at
the turn of the century, it was fashionable for affluent families
to commission windows from Tiffany for family mausoleums.
</P>
<P>
   But the government said Tuesday that Duncan, who also made money
buying and selling the valuable glass, began having dealings in
1998 with a grave robber who had been stealing Tiffany stained
glass and other objects from cemeteries, mausoleums and graveyards
in the New York region.
</P>
<P>
   The grave robber was not identified in the indictment. But
prosecutors said he had once worked in a cemetery and had kept a
set of master keys for cemeteries.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment said Duncan was warned at one point that the
grave robber's stained glass had been stolen but continued to
encourage him to seek out valuable stained glass.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment, as far back as 1992 or 1993, the
grave robber had stolen a 9-foot Tiffany stained-glass window from
a mausoleum in the private Salem Fields Cemetery in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment does not say from whose tomb the window was
stolen, but the cemetery is owned by Temple Emanu-El on Fifth
Avenue and is the final resting place of members of such prominent
families as the Warburgs, Guggenheims, Lewisohns, Strauses and
Loebs.
</P>
<P>
   The government said the grave robber kept and stored the window
until 1998. Because of its size, it was worth hundreds of thousands
of dollars, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany's glass has become valuable, the authorities and other
experts said, because many of his stained-glass windows and other
art objects are enshrined in churches and mausoleums, which rarely
sell them. Tiffany died in 1933.
</P>
<P>
   With the supply finite and the demand high, mausoleums are
especially vulnerable to theft, the authorities said, because of
their minimal security and the fact that in many cases, family
members have also moved away or died, leaving the valuable objects
under the supervision of only the cemetery's caretakers.
</P>
<P>
   The government said that Duncan decided to take advantage of
what it called the ``large and lucrative market for Tiffany stained
glass,'' and he ``turned to suppliers legal and illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the indictment said, Duncan, in conversations with a
middleman who was also not identified, first learned of the
nine-foot window that had been stolen from Salem Fields.
</P>
<P>
   The middleman told Duncan that the window was stolen and
expressed concern that the sale could not be made, the indictment
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Duncan checked a computerized database of stolen art
objects, called the Art Loss Register, the indictment said, and
found no record of the window. The authorities say he then told the
middleman that they could go ahead with the purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Working as equal partners, Duncan and the middleman inspected
the window, which had suffered cracks and damage, and ultimately
negotiated a price with the grave robber of $60,000, the indictment
said.
</P>
<P>
   The grave robber was quoted in the indictment as telling them
that ``it would be impossible to sell the window in the United
States because the window bore identifying numbers or marks that
would alert United States authorities if the window were sold
through a reputable auction house.''
</P>
<P>
   But the middleman told the grave robber not to worry because the
sale was being made to the overseas buyer, the government said.
</P>
<P>
   The middleman ultimately paid the grave robber $30,000 in cash
and $30,000 in checks written on Duncan's account, the indictment
said.
</P>
<P>
   When the grave robber complained that he could not cash the
checks because he did not have a bank account, Duncan accompanied
him to a Citibank branch, and asked a bank employee to cash the
checks for him, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   It says that the nine-foot window was restored in Manhattan and
then shipped to the buyer in Japan. In November 1998, Duncan
received a wire payment of $219,000, which he split with the
middleman, the government said.

 Nonstop Networking at Tech Conference
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Peter Sinton &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Squaw Valley, Calif. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Entrepreneurs, venture capitalists and other high-tech aficionados
at Red Herring's Venture '99 conference here had little time to
gaze at the majestic Sierra or enjoy what's left of the snow.
</P>
<P>
   Hans Swildens, a director of Personify Inc. in San Francisco,
was one of the few who did, and he learned his lesson. He broke his
ankle riding a snowboard down the Granite Chief run Sunday
afternoon and spent the next two days talking to prospective
investors and partners about his interactive marketing software
startup with his leg raised.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 726 invitation-only guests who paid about $2,000
each to attend the popular two-day information technology forum
came to get a leg up on the competition in a different way _ by
networking nonstop.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past five years, the number of publicly traded
information-technology companies has more than doubled and more
than 10,000 additional companies have been privately financed.
</P>
<P>
   That has boosted the fortunes of countless entrepreneurs and
investors. It has also been a boon for Red Herring, a privately
held San Francisco company whose magazine of the same name covers
high-tech startups and is expected to eventually launch its own
public stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   Elton Sherwin, venture capitalist and author of ``The Silicon
Valley Way,'' said conferences such as Red Herring's are the most
efficient way to meet the right people. ``After two days, I have
150 business cards,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the conference business has gotten so big that a San
Francisco startup called Conferenza is making a business of
tracking and reviewing the quality of the events.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a $3.5 billion-a-year business,'' said Conferenza
Editor Doug Van Kirk. ``We've identified 680 technology events and
the fees for these exclusive events range from $2,000 to $5,000. He
added that it's almost like the Grateful Dead attracting 10,000 to
15,000 ``hard core conference junkies'' to 10 or more events a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Red Herring holds seven such conferences a year. They are the
company's main moneymaker, not its slick monthly magazine. In
addition to the high fees charged attendees, sponsors such as
Arthur Andersen and Microsoft pay tens of thousands of dollars to
rub elbows with current and prospective customers and partners.
</P>
<P>
   Those who mingled at the plush Resort at Squaw Creek were
treated to presentations by many of Red Herring's latest list of
greatest 50 private companies in the digital universe and 10 new
companies on the leading edge.
</P>
<P>
   They also packed dark conference rooms to hear luminaries such
as Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Internet analyst Mary Meeker, Sun
Microsystems Chief Science Officer John Gage and successful
Internet entrepreneurs discuss such major issues as whether
e-commerce companies can sustain huge stock market valuations if
they continue to lose money. (The consensus is that they can't.)
</P>
<P>
   But what drew the most interest from attendees was the
one-on-one, high-tech dating game.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Mantra Technologies of San Francisco. It wanted to
attend Red Herring's conference a year ago but was rebuffed because
it was too puny.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the company, whose patented text analysis technology
helps Internet users find sites of interest more easily, was
allowed to take a booth for $7,500. It also used the conference to
announce two deals with other Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   Company President David Hultman said the cost was well worth it.
Mantra is interested in raising venture capital and got to meet
partners from Adobe Capital, Benchmark, Interwest, Mayfield and
other funds as well as talk with the CEOs of potential Internet
partners.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Third Voice, a Redwood City company that started
last year with $5.5 million from venture capital firms Draper
Fisher Jurvetson and Mayfield Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The company took the occasion to announce its product. Rather
than relegate messages to chat rooms or message boards, the product
allows Internet users to post comments directly on any Web site and
then share them with other users.
</P>
<P>
   By presenting its story at Red Herring's conference, the
28-employee company was able to get the word out to the ``in
crowd'' and meet potential clients such as Microsoft and America
Online.
</P>
<P>
   For Gary Hultquist, chairman of Titanium Memory Systems in
Milpitas, the conference represented an opportunity to search for
potential strategic partners like Compaq, Dell or Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   The 3-year-old company has raised $5 million from Titanium
Metals Inc. and $2 million from angel investors to produce
high-performance titanium memory disks that can spin faster than
those made of other materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a partnership with a supplier and want similar
relationships with users,'' said Hultquist.
</P>
<P>
   Little entrepreneurs and VC firms are not the only ones spending
more time and bucks at conferences. So are many high-tech giants
that are striving to cultivate relationships with up-and-coming
firms and become more entrepreneurial themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard, for example, has set up a unit to invest in
Internet entrepreneurs outside the company as well as help
employees inside the company develop ideas that might eventually be
spun off as separate businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditional business models don't work in the Internet
space,'' said Feisal Mosleh, director of business development for
HP's Internet business unit. ``You can't take 18 months to launch
an Internet business,'' he noted. ``And you have to give up the
mind-set that new products have to generate revenues the first year
and profits in the second.''
</P>
<P>
   Mosleh's unit has identified about 10 of HP's own technologies,
such as customer relationship management software, that might be
spun off as freestanding companies. It also has invested a few
million each with about three outside entrepreneurs and is looking
to place bets on dozens more as well as work with venture firms to
help fund some of its own technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking for financial partners, entrepreneurial partners,
marketing partners and friendships that can help us own more of the
e-services ecosystem,'' Mosleh explained.
</P>
<P>
   Mosleh not only attends Red Herring conferences but similar
forums sponsored by Technologic Partners, Garage.com (which
includes angel investors) and investment banks.

 Kernel of Controversy at Biotech Forum
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Tom Abate &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Seattle _ A small band of protesters beating drums and dressed as
mutant ears of corn provided a cultural counterpoint to the 5,000
suit-clad biotech executives and scientists gathered here for the
industry's largest annual trade show.
</P>
<P>
   The 75 protesters marched outside the BIO '99 conference at
Washington State Convention Center to call attention to their fears
that genetically modified crops could pose risks to humans. That
position is rejected by biotech industry experts, who say Americans
have been eating genetically enhanced soybeans and other crops for
a decade with no ill effects.
</P>
<P>
   The protest, though noisy, went largely unnoticed by most trade
show attendees, who were preoccupied with the gloomy financial
outlook for biotech.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The five-day BIO '99 event, sponsored by the Biotechnology
Industry Organization, is the industry's largest annual gathering.
In addition to commercial exhibits of lab tools, the show features
dozens of seminars on topics ranging from how to secure venture
financing to how fruit fly genes can help us understand human
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever executives filled a meeting room, talk quickly centered
on the chronic cash shortage threatening hundreds of small biotech
firms and how young companies are coping with the fact that stock
investors have abandoned biotech in favor of the Internet
</P>
<P>
   ``When times are really bad, you get a huge showing at meetings
like this,'' said Richard Schneider of Seattle's Domain Associates
venture fund, after his talk about VC financing was moved to a
larger hall.
</P>
<P>
   Another Seattle venture capitalist, Robert Nelson of Arch
Venture Partners, summed up the industry's woes. Wall Street money
managers have stopped buying small biotech firms, shutting off the
flow not just of stock funds, but of private venture capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know of only five or six venture firms in the whole country
that are willing to take the lead in funding'' new biotech
startups, Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   With no end in sight to the funding drought that began last
summer, biotech startups must dramatically change how they do
business, said Doros Platika, chief executive of Ontogeny Inc., a
Massachusetts firm working on cancer drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Platika said young firms used to raise money to run the clinical
trials needed to win Food and Drug Administration approval for new
drugs. But that can take five years and cost $500 million, and
startups no longer have that time or money. So they sell their best
ideas to large drug companies and keep looking for new
breakthroughs in hopes that Wall Street will rediscover biotech.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet bubble can't last forever,'' Platika said, adding
that demographic trends favor drugs and other biotech products.
``The Baby Boomers are aging; the nation will soon look like
Florida,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A more upbeat attitude pervaded the scientific panels where
researchers discussed promising fields like genomics, the use of
genes to predict or cure diseases and biologic traits.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Rubin, a geneticist at the University of California at
Berkeley, drew an overflow crowd in the 300-seat hall where he
explained how fruit fly studies help guide research on the genetic
causes of human diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Though far simpler biologically than humans, fruit flies have
many of the same basic genes as us higher life forms, Rubin said.
Because fruit flies go through their life cycle in 10 days, they
are ideal for studies of genetic mutations _ such as how a given
gene makes flies more sensitive to light over successive
generations. Studies like these might provide clues about inherited
blindness.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the controversy at the show occurred outside at the
demonstration. During one presentation yesterday, San Francisco
investment banker Steve Burrill reminded attendees that in Europe,
protests against genetically enhanced crops have sparked much
larger protests. Although Burrill thinks the protesters are wrong,
he warned that the uproar over so-called ``Frankenstein foods has
the potential to swamp the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Speakers at a seminar on clinical trials also discussed another
touchy subject yesterday. Earlier this week, a New York Times
investigation revealed that doctors routinely are paid to enroll
patients in clinical trials of new drugs and that in some
instances, unethical researchers have faked results to keep earning
study fees.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Newman of PharmaNet Inc., a New Jersey firm that conducts
clinical trials, said it is only fair that doctors get paid to
administer test drugs to patient volunteers, and he insisted that
the safeguards in place ensure that fraud is rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my 20 years in the industry,'' Newman said, ``we've made
mistakes, but there are many checks and balances.''

   GANDERKESEE, Germany _ Into a stinking mixture of potato peels,
apple cores, animal excrement, grass, wilting cabbage and rotten
carrots, Gerald Vollmer-Heuer casually tossed about 100,000 German
marks, or $57,000.
</P>
<P>
   He smiled, asked a visitor to excuse the stench and watched the
long-prized symbol of Germany's economic virility disappear into a
heaving mound of refuse chugging along a conveyor belt. Nothing
more natural in the world, for this corporate director, than the
notion of turning Europe's most trusted currency into compost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mark will enrich our soil, as it once enriched our
lives,'' he said. ``It contains carbon and cellulose that are good
for my production process. Waste tends to be damp, and the paper
absorbs the dampness.''
</P>
<P>
   These are trying times in Europe. A war in the Balkans is being
prosecuted, with unhappy results, by a group of leaders who spent
their youths denouncing war as wrong. The buoyant U.S. economy
amounts to a daily dose of depressant for a lethargic continent.
Young people cannot find jobs. A man could be forgiven for going
mad.
</P>
<P>
   But for all his hilarity as he sprinkles marks into muck,
Vollmer-Heuer is sane. Germany, like most countries in the
15-member European Union, has decided to eliminate its currency by
2002 in favor of the nascent common currency, the euro. That plan
has raised the question of what to do with 2,600 tons of German
mark bills.
</P>
<P>
   That may seem a simple question. Burn them. Shred them and dump
them in a landfill site. Sell them to some American collector as
souvenirs of Germany's stunning reconstruction after World War II.
Recycle them as toilet paper or official stationery for the
European Central Bank in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   But no. This being ecological, earnest Germany, nothing is quite
that simple. The bills contain oils and waxes that make them
water-resistant but also make them impossible to recycle. Landfill
sites are expensive. The Bundesbank does not want the onetime pride
of Germany ending up on souvenir stands in Florida. And burning is
wasteful.
</P>
<P>
   So the notion of the mark-as-manure has emerged, and nobody, as
yet, is being sniffy about it. Indeed, it is being viewed with
great seriousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, if you think of the smell and what goes into
compost, it is not that nice,'' said Karl Schnitzler, a spokesman
for the Bavarian State Central Bank, the institution that will
decide on the mark's fate. ``But if you think that compost is a
stimulus to growth, then it is quite a nice symbol.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. Still, it is mildly shocking, and more than mildly
nauseating, to watch the famous bills _ shredded into 800 pieces
each before 60 million marks ($34.2 million) were given to
Vollmer-Heuer's Environmental Protection North plant in this
northern German town on a trial basis _ sitting like confetti on a
sea of putrid filth. The money consists of old bills that are being
withdrawn from circulation.
</P>
<P>
   A man with a protective mask over the lower part of his face
pulls impurities like glass and plastic from the muck. ``You
wouldn't believe the things we pull out,'' Vollmer-Heuer said.
``Dead dogs, dead cats, old spades. People are crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Crazy is the word that Dirk Adolf, the technical director of a
waste recycling company called GFU, thinks appropriate for the
mark-to-compost proposal. He has another idea that came to him
while treating labels from bottles.
</P>
<P>
   These labels, he found, are useful for making tiny bullet-like
pellets about 10 millimeters long and 3 millimeters thick.
</P>
<P>
   Now what, it is legitimate to ask, is the use of tiny
bullet-like pellets made from discarded bottle labels? Well, Adolf
is able to sell them to the construction industry, which puts them
into bricks. As the brick is fired, the pellets inside burn _
creating a lighter brick with unusual insulation qualities.
</P>
<P>
   Pellets made of bottle labels could equally well be made of
billions of dollars' worth of shredded marks. That, at least, is
Adolf's proposal. ``Compost is a lousy end for the mark,'' he said.
``It is cheap, it is degrading, it is smelly. What I propose is
something clean, useful and solid.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Bavarian State Central Bank, the marks-to-bricks idea is
also getting appropriate consideration. If compost, at a stretch,
can symbolize growth, bricks are an obvious symbol of stability,
the very essence of the mark during its postwar life and the most
desired quality for its successor, the euro.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stability of bricks is very interesting to us,''
Schnitzler said. ``This is a useful idea. We will make a decision
on the two proposals by the end of the year. Of course, we could
give some to compost and some to bricks.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a fudge would, of course, have the advantage of symbolizing
growth and stability, both much needed in Europe these days. But
Vollmer-Heuer is determined to get the entire load.
</P>
<P>
   After it emerges from sorting on the conveyor belts, his refuse
is stored and periodically churned for at least two weeks in
tunnel-like containers where the humidity is 100 percent and the
temperature about 125 degrees. Further sifting follows, and after
about 12 weeks a fine, odorless compost is ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a ratio of 10 percent of shredded bills to other waste, our
typical sack of compost will contain bills worth about 200,000
marks,'' he said. ``That is rich stuff and it is good for
Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   But what Germans now believe will be good for Germany is a solid
euro. Having fretted over the loss of the beloved mark, they now
give it little thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Building pellets or manure, the question is secondary,'' said
Schnitzler of the Bavarian State Central Bank. ``The mark will soon
be history, and what matters is the stability of the currency in
use.''
</P>

TUG OF WAR OVER A SCARF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Each troubled society has its own symbols of conflict, and when
software engineer Merve Kavakci refused to remove her head scarf to
take the parliamentary oath as a new deputy in the Turkish
Parliament, the scarf became an emblem of the social and political
struggle between Turkey's Islamicists and its secularists.
</P>
<P>
   It is a conflict that means different things to different
people. For Turks who wish to preserve the secularizing tradition
of Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey, the head scarf
symbolizes a defiant challenge from the Islamicists of Kavakci's
Virtue Party.
</P>
<P>
   For the Islamicists, the government's ban against the wearing of
head scarves in universities and government offices signifies an
intolerable intrusion into the religious life of Turkish Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Between the heirs of Ataturk and proponents of an Islamic
society, no middle ground seems possible. Secularists are fiercely
proud that Ataturk conferred on women the right to vote and a civil
status equal to men's. They regard the conquest of equal rights for
women as an achievement that defines the nationhood of modern
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   By depriving Kavakci of both her seat in Parliament and her
Turkish citizenship _ ostensibly because she acquired US
citizenship without the permission of Turkish authorities _ the
government was declaring that she could not simultaneously be a
good Turk and a good Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   Her symbolic act incited Turkey's president, Suleyman Demirel,
to accuse her of being an agent of foreign countries. Iran was the
one he named. In Iran, Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, member of the
powerful Council of Guardians, derided Turkish authorities for
being ``so dogmatic, antireligious, and antifreedom that they
cannot tolerate half a meter of fabric on a woman's head.''
</P>
<P>
   The preferred American solution would be to let Turkish women
wear what they like while preserving all the civil rights Ataturk
instituted for them. But the American mentality may not be well
suited to understand the symbolic conflict over a lawmaker's head
scarf.

STOCK AROUND THE CLOCK

<TEXT>
<P>
   The stock market's traditional 6 1/2-hour trading day is scary
enough for some investors, who can probably feel an ulcer forming
at the thought of an exchange that never sleeps. But the all-night
market is the way of the future _ one more convenience, or curse,
of the computer age.
</P>
<P>
   The technological revolution that has spawned on-line brokerage
houses and lets consumers into portfolios with a keystroke has also
created the virtual trading floor. Here companies known as
``electronic communications networks'' allow brokers to buy and
sell for their clients before and after Wall Street's opening and
closing bells.
</P>
<P>
   These companies are planning to push the envelope to a 24-hour
trading day, possibly starting this summer, to fill what they say
is a roaring consumer demand for instant and constant investing.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the competition, the New York Stock Exchange is
considering a plan to allow early-morning trading from 5 until 9
and extend evening hours from 5 until midnight. Nasdaq is also
looking at an expanded day, allowing evening trading from 5 until
9.
</P>
<P>
   The shift will push society further down the rabbit hole of the
limitless office, where work and ``leisure'' blur at a constantly
clicking keyboard. It is almost impossible for a person to be truly
off the clock anymore, for the laptop computer has become a
vacation gear staple.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the twitchy investor who can't sleep, even in a beach
house, will be able to call his or her broker, who will also be
expected to be awake, even in a beach house. Trading hunches will
be played at 3 a.m. or reversed from whatever they were at 3 p.m.
because of a news bulletin just coming over the BBC.
</P>
<P>
   The world is wired and can't unplug. The 24-hour cyber stock
market joins the all-night grocery store, the round-the-clock
catalogue order department, the mall open till midnight, and the
continuous on-line auction as one more place where a person gets
absorbed in the frenzy of purchase and can no longer hear the quiet
sanity of commerce observing quitting time.

   NEAH BAY, Wash. _ Some jubilant Makah Indians feasted on the
blubber and raw whale meat and declared themselves spiritually
transported back in time. Others spat the meat out onto the beach
or struggled to wash it down with that most traditional of
beverages, Coca-Cola. Protesters called ``shame on you'' from boats
huddled out in the coastal fog of Neah Bay.
</P>
<P>
   On the day after the Makahs killed a 30-ton, 30-and-a-half-foot
female gray whale in the chill waters of the Pacific Ocean near
Washington's Olympic Peninsula, the tribe's first such kill in 75
years, hundreds of Makah Indians gathered on the beach for their
very first taste of whale meat, the principal source of food for
their whaling ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe set to work Tuesday on dismantling the huge carcass,
all in preparation for a series of feasts that tribal leaders say
will help reconnect the Makahs to the traditions and ceremonies of
their forefathers and reinvigorate members of all ages on a
reservation where half the people live below the federal poverty
line and some Makah youth battle with modern scourges, including
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great day, a historic day for the Makah,'' said Ben
Johnson Jr., the tribal chairman, ``but there are a lot of other
hurdles we still have to jump over, many things to work on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Makah men who captured the whale plan to freeze and cure
much of the meat for ceremonies they will hold in the coming weeks,
and the whale's bones are to be strung together for a display at
the Makah Museum.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the Makah were celebrating their success in
capturing the whale, which lay partially carved under a blue tarp
on the beach on Tuesday, controversy over the event continued,
clearly intensified by the widespread television broadcast of the
whale being harpooned, shot and spilling a stream of red blood into
the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Angry protesters gathered here and at a rally Monday night in
downtown Seattle, and a group of whale-watch tour boat operators
from Canada showed up to voice their opposition to the killing.
Computer hackers got into the tribe's Web site, turning it red with
dripping blood and changing ``Neah Bay'' on the map to ``Death
Bay.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are acting totally differently from their ancestors, who
were sad and somber and respectful after a hunt,'' said Paul
Watson, leader of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, one of the
conservation groups that had tried to disrupt the hunt. ``We'll
mourn for the whale. They're acting like a bunch of redneck hunters
having a good old time.''
</P>
<P>
   Tribal leaders, who petitioned the International Whaling
Commission for the right to kill up to five whales a year for the
next four years for ``subsistence and ceremonial purposes,'' said
they may not conduct another hunt until next fall, when the gray
whales pass through here on their southward migration.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, they certainly have their hands full with the huge
mammal, and plans to distribute food from it to the 1,700 Makahs
who live on the wind-swept tribal land here at the very northwest
tip of the continental United States.
</P>
<P>
   Many Makahs chewed for hours on small chunks of blubber that had
the consistency of taffy, they said, and a strong, salty taste. The
meat can be softened by boiling, cured or smoked to a jerky-like
consistency, or even fried or grilled. ``It's not like we have a
bunch of favorite recipes to work with,'' said Richard Markishtum,
a 32-year-old fisherman. ``This may be an ancient tradition, but
it's all new to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether whale meat will again become a major source of food here
remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a much more complicated issue than whether or not
they just like the taste of whale meat,'' said Larry Zimmerman,
director of the American Indian and Native studies program at the
University of Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may like it, they may not like it,'' he said. ``They may
say they like it because the dominant society is trying to get them
to stop eating it. They're going to have to decide on their own
terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the West Coast Anti-Whaling Society, echoing concerns
of other protesters, said they feared the Makah's hunt would open a
``Pandora's box'' of petitions by other groups for the the right to
hunt whales, and more broadly could lead to relaxation of the bans
that many countries, including the United States, have imposed on
all commercial whaling. (Some nations, including Norway, Russia and
Japan, continue to engage in the practice and may aboriginal
groups, including some in Alaska, are allowed special subsistence
or ceremonial privileges to hunt.)
</P>
<P>
   Already, two coastal tribes in British Columbia are asking for
the right to hunt gray whales, a move the British Columbia
government vows to fight.
</P>
<P>
   But the Makah said that the whale taken Monday, near Father and
Son Rocks in the Pacific Ocean off Olympic National Park, will not
be used for commercial purposes. Instead, they said, it and any
other whales captured will be for tribal use only, or to share with
other Indian groups. Members of the Quillayute, Hoh, Tulalip and
Puyallup tribes have gathered here in the past few days to help
celebrate the successful hunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about money,'' said Theron Parker, who threw the
first harpoon Monday morning and got to partake of the first piece
cut from the whale when it was towed to shore that evening. ``This
is about a great tradition. It's about calling out to our
ancestors. It's all about who we are as a people.''

BLUSHING AND FUMBLING, YET VERY SURE OF HIMSELF

   LONDON _ Is Hugh Grant the very model of a modern English
gentleman?
</P>
<P>
   He certainly seemed that way in ``Four Weddings and a Funeral,''
a hugely successful confection of a film largely kept afloat by his
bachelor character's diffident charm, self-deprecating wit and
endearing air of chronic embarrassment. (Grant's hair, which
flopped spectacularly onto his forehead in a patently non-American
way, played a fine supporting role in that 1994 movie.)
</P>
<P>
   Now he has been cast in the same mold in ``Notting Hill,'' a
comedy, opening on Friday, in which he plays the divorced, ironical
owner of a sleepy London bookstore whose life is turned upside down
by the sudden appearance of the world's most famous actress, played
by Julia Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence exists that there is another side to Grant, 38,
however. There is his long-term relationship with his glamorous
girlfriend, the model, actress and producer Elizabeth Hurley, who
recently appeared in a British newspaper under the headline ``What
on earth will Liz Hurley wear next?'' along with photographic
evidence of her predilection for bosom-baring, thigh-skimming,
skintight outfits.
</P>
<P>
   There is also, of course, the memory of a notorious incident on
Sunset Boulevard in 1995, when Grant was charged with performing
``lewd acts'' with a prostitute who had the tabloid-friendly name
Divine Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, there are the roles in which he has played against
type: the comically uptight husband in the strange Roman Polanski
film ``Bitter Moon'' (1992); the young Anglican priest in
``Sirens'' (1994); the earnest doctor who uncovers a murderous
scheme in ``Extreme Measures'' (1996), which was the first movie
produced by Simian Films, the company he and Ms. Hurley run
together. And finally, there is his own account of himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``These roles play into a certain fantasy of what people want
English people to be,'' Grant said, referring to his characters in
``Four Weddings'' and ``Notting Hill.'' ``Whereas half the time, as
you know, we're vomiting beer and beating people up. I know I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in his chaotic office at Simian Films in central
London, preppily dressed in beige trousers, blue sweater, brown
suede shoes _ the ultrapolite, ultrahandsome Grant seemed an
unlikely candidate for a barroom brawl. He said ``Sorry?'' when he
lost his train of thought, and in a discussion of English accents,
he blushed with embarrassment at the memory of Prime Minister Tony
Blair's pseudopopulist effort to adopt a London street accent on a
talk show last year.
</P>
<P>
   Grant said that he detested the baseball caps he wears in a stab
at anonymity but that he would ``look even more of a prat if I wore
a fedora.''
</P>
<P>
   And when asked about Divine Brown, Grant made it clear that he
would prefer being strung up by his fingertips to being drawn into
public self-analysis of any kind. He raked his fingers through his
hair, only to have it fall back in his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``My God, people go through far worse things in their lives,''
he said, looking pained. ``You just take it on the chin.'' (In
fact, he pleaded no contest to the charges, paid a modest fine and
made an abject apology on Jay Leno's ``Tonight Show.'')
</P>
<P>
   Richard Curtis, who wrote ``Four Weddings'' as well as ``Notting
Hill,'' for which he also worked as executive producer, said he had
always had Grant in mind for the second film. ``He's always aware
that he's pretending; he doesn't get in so deep in it that he
completely believes he is the character,'' Curtis said. ``I love
him for his lack of responsibility, for his lack of feeling that
he's in a deeply serious business. On the set he gives out the
feeling that it's all good fun _ although I did notice that his
script was absolutely full of notes to himself on his character and
how he should say the lines.''
</P>
<P>
   He seems unlikely to say it himself (``He's happy to say at the
end of each take, `I'm the worst actor in the world,''' Curtis
said), but this is a particularly good time for Hugh Grant.
``Notting Hill'' doesn't pretend to be a vast departure from ``Four
Weddings'' _ in both movies, Grant falls in love with an elusive,
out-of-his-league American woman against a backdrop of controlled
comic mayhem _ but advance word has been close to ecstatic.
</P>
<P>
   So confident are the filmmakers that they boldly rescheduled its
release to fall just nine days after the opening of ``Star Wars:
Episode One _ The Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   Another film, ``Mickey Blue Eyes,'' which was produced by Simian
and which also stars Grant as a charming English auctioneer in New
York who finds himself in a pickle with the Mafia when he becomes
engaged to a mobster's daughter (Jeanne Tripplehorn), is also
playing to raves from test audiences; it opens on Aug. 13.
</P>
<P>
   And Grant recently found out that he's wanted for Woody Allen's
next film, one of those untitled projects that even the actors know
nothing about.
</P>
<P>
   Grant came to acting almost by accident, or at least that's what
he says (he has another very English trait: an inability to admit
to achievement through hard work). Born into a family he describes
as ``impoverished gentlefolk,'' he went to a local school in
Hammersmith, west London, where he briefly dipped into a street
accent of his own before graduating from Oxford with a degree in
English literature.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In dusting off a 130-year-old, long-forgotten provision of the
14th Amendment, the Supreme Court has placed a barrier in the way
of social jingoists who would target the poor for discriminatory
treatment. The court's protection of a class of welfare recipients
was a small step, but one of fundamental decency. And the principle
involved may have implications beyond welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
   The case centered on a California law limiting public assistance
for recently arrived residents to the amount they would have
received in their home states. The court overturned the law in a
7-2 vote because it violated the 14th Amendment's requirement that
states accord the same standing to all citizens, newcomers and
natives alike.
</P>
<P>
   The provision is a sound one. The discriminatory treatment
mapped out by California _ and 15 other states, including Vermont,
Rhode Island, and New Hampshire _ was an expression of hostility to
the poor who move to other states in search of a better life.
California defended the action as a way to save $10.9 million in a
$2.9 billion annual welfare budget. Justice John Paul Stevens, who
wrote the majority opinion, exposed the hypocrisy of the claim by
pointing out that a similar saving could have been made by reducing
the monthly payments to all recipients by 72 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William Rehnquist, in dissenting, pointed out a
weakness in the majority's argument by finding no difference
between the welfare rule and similar state-imposed limitations on
gaining the right to vote, divorce, or lower tuition rates in
colleges and universities. His dissent may open the way to
challenges of those rules as well.
</P>
<P>
   While the principle of state control is firmly established and
contributes to lively debate about competing concepts of tax
policy, education, and similar issues, discrimination among classes
of citizens is unacceptable. The court has done a service with the
ruling. In the process, it has helped a small group of people who
are in demonstrable need of equal treatment.

GOLFERS FIND LASER SURGERY A SIGHT FOR POOR EYES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
FORT WORTH, Texas _ Fred Funk never envisioned a turnaround in his
golf game. He simply wanted to regain the ability to read a bedside
alarm clock without squinting.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But two days after undergoing laser eye surgery, Funk found
himself atop the leader board at the 1998 Kemper Open. He finished
third.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, Funk broke a two-year victory drought, winning
the Deposit Guaranty Golf Classic. Three months after that, Funk
finished second at the Buick Challenge. By the time the 1998 season
ended, Funk had carved out his first $1 million season in 10 years
on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, Funk is puzzled by the golfer's equivalent of the
chicken-and-egg riddle: Which came first, better swings or a better
view of those swings? But he knows that laser eye surgery, for the
nearsighted golfer, has a lot in common with chicken soup for the
infirm player.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sure hasn't hurt,'' said Funk, who ranks 43rd on the season
money list with $436,453 heading into the opening round of the
MasterCard Colonial tomorrow at Colonial Country Club. ``I've
played some awfully good golf since I had it done. It's certainly
been a factor in my game getting better, but I don't know how
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Funk is among a growing group of golfers who have undergone a
surgical procedure called laser in situ keratomileusis, or LASIK,
in the past two years. Some, such as Funk and Fort Worth resident
Mark Brooks, have enjoyed tangible turnarounds in their on-course
performance. Others have not.
</P>
<P>
   But the procedure has been deemed enough of a success that it is
gaining popularity among professional athletes. Colonial
competitors Corey Pavin, Paul Stankowski, Kenny Perry and Tom Kite
have undergone LASIK since the start of the 1998 season. In the
past year, they've been joined by Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman,
race-car driver Bryan Herta and a slew of major-league baseball
players, including Wade Boggs, Wally Joyner, Bernard Gilkey and Al
Martin.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure, known as a ``flap and zap'' in the medical
industry, involves a surgeon folding back tissue from the surface
of the eyeball while a laser reshapes the cornea to improve the
patient's vision to 20-20 or better. Industry analysts predicted
that more than 725,000 LASIK procedures will be done this year in
the United States, compared with 22,000 when the surgery was
introduced in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors caution that some people are not candidates for the
surgery, which costs about $2,000 per eye, and that there are
risks. In some cases, the correction might not be permanent. And
there is no proven correlation between improved vision and improved
athletic performance.
</P>
<P>
   Yet one thing is certain, said Brooks, who underwent the
procedure April 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's worth it, from a quality-of-life standpoint,'' said
Brooks, who waved goodbye to corrective lenses after 25 years. ``In
my mind, what I did is permanent. But even if you told me, `We'll
give you 20-20, but you have to go through the surgery every five
years to keep it,' I'd still do it. There's no question it's an
advantage to see better.''
</P>
<P>
   The early effects on Brooks' golf game are encouraging. Since
undergoing the surgery, Brooks has broken or matched par in seven
consecutive rounds at PGA Tour events, his longest stretch of the
season. Pavin, a two-time Colonial champ who had his eyes done in
November, has won more money at tour events this season ($270,029)
than in the previous two combined.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks said he finds himself backing off fewer putts since the
surgery. Pavin said his judgment of distance might be more acute.
But both emphasized that the difference in vision quality is
minimal when compared with how they saw the world through
prescription contact lenses.
</P>
<P>
   The joy, however, rests in not having to fumble for glasses in
the middle of the night and not worrying about lost or torn
contacts. For Kite, who had worn glasses for 36 years before having
the LASIK procedure in January 1998, the payoff comes in improved
peripheral vision and in not having to wipe lenses when playing in
rain. For allergy sufferers such as Brooks and Tom Byrum, the
surgery can cut back on watery eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Byrum, who finished 51st Sunday in the GTE Byron Nelson Classic,
said he is able to keep his eyes clear during rounds with
prescription eye drops that he could not take while wearing
contacts. Like Brooks and Stankowski, he also finds himself making
quicker, truer reads on the greens.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're putting, you stare at the line so much that your
contacts tend to dry out,'' Byrum said. ``So you blink to try and
make them comfortable, and sometimes it doesn't work. I used to hit
a lot of putts with one eye closed, but that's not a distraction
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Most players said the procedure, which takes a matter of
seconds, is painless and has resulted in immediate vision
improvement with no side effects. Perry, however, had to stare into
the laser for a second time after his initial session did not
produce the desired correction in October 1998. Since then, Perry
said he has struggled with depth perception and relied on his
caddie to read more putts.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he wouldn't change anything about the experience, Perry
said, because his allergy concerns have been minimized.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been awesome. My eyes aren't irritated when I play. I
don't get junk in my contacts anymore,'' said Perry, who is 95th on
the money list ($195,690) after finishing 58th in 1998. ``I'm just
going through an adjustment period. Over time, I think everything
will settle in. At first, I thought I did the wrong thing. Now, I
know I did the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Stankowski, a Flower Mound resident, is equally convinced. He
underwent the procedure last summer in Dallas while 25 prospective
patients watched.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some second thoughts right before the surgery. Having a
guy cut on your eyeball is not a pleasant thought,'' Stankowski
said. ``But I knew the success rate was phenomenal and I figured,
`Why not?' If it works, I'll be hassle-free for a long time. If
not, I'll go into broadcasting.''
</P>
<P>
   Although his PGA Tour success rate dipped immediately after the
surgery, Stankowski is far from the broadcast booth. He finished
96th on last season's money list, down 75 spots from 1997, but has
rebounded to No. 81 heading into Colonial, with $235,114 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Said Brooks: ``It's not something you do for your golf game.
It's something you do for yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   But if your golf game improves along with it, no one on the PGA
Tour will blink back tears of regret.
</P>

<P>
   He was all set to pursue a master's degree in the history of art
at the Courtauld Institute when, he said, he decided to take a
``joke detour into acting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be a laugh,'' he said. ``I ended up in the
Nottingham Playhouse, playing parts like Tree in Wind and Third
Shouting Peasant.''
</P>
<P>
   Feeling restless, he and some friends set up a comedy review,
``The Jockeys of Norfolk'' (the title is from a throwaway
Shakespeare line), which was a huge hit in fringe theater but
bombed on television.
</P>
<P>
   From there came roles in films like ``Maurice,'' as well as a
selection of American television projects, including Judith
Krantz's ``Till We Meet Again,'' in which he played Courtney Cox's
brother, and ``Our Sons,'' a movie of the week in which he was cast
as gay man whose lover was dying of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   And then came his ``slough of unemployment,'' during which Grant
whiled away his days at the London Library, matching activity to
mood by writing a novel called ``Slack,'' about ``a person whose
life has nothing in it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to write something in the morning and think, `I'm a
genius,' then go out for a chicken sandwich and come back and throw
it away,'' Grant said. He was at a low ebb when he was called in to
read for Mike Newell's ``Four Weddings'': ``I was told that the
casting director said, `You'll meet Hugh Grant for this part over
my dead body.'''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Curtis had his doubts. ``He came in claiming that he
was on his last legs, that acting was no job for an adult to do,''
Curtis said. ``And I was against him, because I thought he might be
too posh. But he wasn't. Casting him was the luckiest break in my
career.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Four Weddings'' had a budget of about $5 million and was shot
in 36 days. ``There were scenes that we shot where literally we had
five minutes to get through a two-page scene,'' Grant recalled
fondly. ``Someone would say, `Stand against the wall!' and we'd all
stand against the wall and say our lines.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, ``Notting Hill,'' directed by Roger Michell, had a
budget of $43 million, considerable star power in Grant and Ms.
Roberts and a luxurious 10-week shooting schedule. ``I could have
put the trailer I had in `Four Weddings' into the fridge of my
trailer in `Notting Hill,''' Grant said.
</P>
<P>
   Joking aside, it would be a mistake to underestimate Grant, his
friends say, particularly in his newfound role as producer. ``There
was a funny new look in his eyes when he talked about `Mickey Blue
Eyes,' a responsibility and maturity that I'm not used to in him,''
Curtis said.
</P>
<P>
   And underneath what she described as an ``incredibly charming,
slightly amusing, fumbling and self-deprecating person,'' Ms.
Roberts found her co-star to have more gravitas than his screen
persona, or even he, would allow. ``Hugh is a formidable person
with a very strong sense of self,'' she said. ``He's incredibly
clear about who he is and what he's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Has success changed Hugh Grant? Of course it has: after the
interview, he caught the Concorde to New York and then spent the
evening with Ms. Hurley at the VH1 Divas Live '99 concert at the
Beacon Theater, where Ms. Hurley introduced one of the singers.
(Versace sent over a suit for him to wear, while Ms. Hurley,
according to The Daily Mail, appeared in a daringly bare ``sideless
dress.'')
</P>
<P>
   But that's not really him, he says. ``I still think like an
unemployed actor living in Hammersmith,'' Grant said. ``If someone
said to me, `I'm sorry, Hugh, but a law's just been passed and
you're not allowed to act anymore in your life,' I'd be thrilled.''
</P>
<P>
   There's always the London Library, and the career that never
was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd just go back to my sad old fantasy about writing a book.''

FOR AN ACTOR, A ROLE IS AN ENIGMA TILL THE FINAL CUT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 23) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ When actors sign up for a movie, they rarely have much
notion how it _ or they _ will end up looking on screen. David
Thewlis learned that some years ago with Mike Leigh. He duly
followed the British director's ritual of spending weeks creating a
character down to the tiniest detail.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Life Is Sweet,'' he was reduced to licking chocolate off
Jane Horrocks' breasts. With ``Naked,'' on the other hand, he won
the best actor prize at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   With his latest film, Bernardo Bertolucci's ``Besieged,'' which
opened in New York on Friday, Thewlis was equally unsure what to
expect. It is a minimalist film set almost entirely in a Roman
palazzo, a love story between two people who are seldom seen
together, who barely exchange words and about whom we learn little.
But this time, at least, Thewlis was pleasantly surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were making it, I sometimes forgot Bertolucci was
directing it and I worried that it would be very dull or it
wouldn't work or there was something implausible about the whole
scenario,'' he recalled in a recent conversation in a central
London hotel. ``When I saw it, I really liked it and it surprised
me because I felt I was watching something totally new. I was in it
and Thandie Newton was in it, but it didn't feel like the film we
had made.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie, adapted by Bertolucci and his wife, Clare Peploe,
from James Lasdun's short story ``The Siege,'' is about a British
pianist, Kinsky, who lives beside the Spanish Steps in a crumbling
mansion full of paintings and sculptures. He takes on as his
part-time housekeeper a beautiful young African woman, Shandurai
(Ms. Newton), who needs a home while she studies medicine.
</P>
<P>
   We learn that she fled to Rome from her native country after her
husband was arrested for opposing a grisly dictatorship. But Kinsky
falls for her long before she reveals she is married.
</P>
<P>
   While he plays his piano upstairs and she plays African music
downstairs, they gradually grow used to each other, although, ever
the gentleman, Kinsky makes no further advances. Shandurai notices
with puzzlement, however, that his art objects are slowly
disappearing from his house. When his beloved piano is finally
taken away, she realizes that he is raising money to buy her
husband's freedom. Whether he is doing this out of altruism or to
win Shandurai's love is never clear. In the end, it does not
matter.
</P>
<P>
   The $3 million film, Bertolucci's first since ``Stealing
Beauty,'' is a far cry from some of his recent big-screen
extravaganzas like ``The Last Emperor,'' ``The Sheltering Sky'' and
``Little Buddha.'' Rather, in its intimacy, it seems closer to his
much earlier ``Last Tango in Paris,'' although that film's sexual
violence is replaced here by gentle sensuality, perhaps the
difference between Bertolucci, age 32, and Bertolucci, age 59.
</P>
<P>
   Bertolucci said he had cast Thewlis as Kinsky because he liked
him in ``Naked,'' but also because he wanted someone ``in the great
tradition of English eccentricity'' to draw a sharp contrast with
Ms. Newton's Shandurai.
</P>
<P>
   `At the beginning of the film, he exhibits a kind of fantastic
awkwardness,'' Bertolucci said in a telephone interview from Rome,
where he was recovering from back surgery. ``In the dusty, decadent
atmosphere of this house, you have tapestries, paintings, carpets,
old furniture, a piano and you also have him. He is part of that
world of European culture. And in the end, he becomes kind of
attractive. But I wanted Kinsky to be mysterious even to the actor
playing him.''
</P>
<P>
   Why is he living in this big house? How did this situation arise
in the first place?
</P>
<P>
   ``The only hint was that Kinsky had inherited the mansion from
an aunt,'' Thewlis, 36, recalled. ``But Bernardo was very much into
letting it remain an enigma. Certainly not the Mike Leigh approach.
But I was happy with that. I don't think it's always necessary to
plot a whole back story.''
</P>
<P>
   It was necessary, however, for Thewlis to learn to play the
piano, at least sufficiently for the camera to pan from his face to
his hands on more than one occasion. The Italian composer Alessio
Vlad, who also wrote some of the movie score, was his teacher. And
the result, Thewlis said proudly, is a fair rendering of 45 seconds
of Grieg, 45 seconds of Mozart and 45 seconds of Bach.
</P>
<P>
   It helped that he was musical. In fact, growing up in the
northern seaside resort of Blackpool, he had originally planned to
become a rock star. With two friends, he formed a small band: he
wrote, sang and played the guitar. But when the friends decided to
go to drama school in London, he followed suit, although he had
never before thought of acting as a career.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After drama school he had no trouble finding work, in
commercials, on the stage, and eventually in some movies. He worked
first with Mike Leigh in the late 1980s in a short film, ``The
Short and Curlies,'' in which he played a man who told bad jokes.
In ``Life Is Sweet'' (1990), he was the chocolate licker. Then,
with ``Naked'' (1993), he made his name as Johnny, a drifter turned
manic philosopher who roams the streets and minds of London.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my films grow out of the strength of the people
involved,'' Leigh explained, ``and `Naked' evolved when I
recognized an actor who could do this extraordinary thing of both
creating this character without sentimentality and getting inside
the guy's brain. David is a tremendously original and intelligent
and committed actor. That's the truth of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thewlis, though, initially considered his role in ``Naked'' a
sort of compensation for ending up with just two scenes in ``Life
Is Sweet'' after doing ``all that famous research.'' But when the
film came out, earning him best actor awards from the New York Film
Critics Circle and the National Society of Film Critics as well as
the Cannes jury, everything changed.
</P>
<P>
   ```Naked' propelled me into a whole other league,'' he said.
``America started calling. I went over to Los Angeles and met all
those people, and I started doing a few American films of various
levels of quality. A couple of years ago, I made a decision to come
back home. I always kept a place here, but I hung out in Los
Angeles longer than I probably should have done.''
</P>
<P>
   The results were mixed. He appeared in Rob Cohen's
``Dragonheart'' and Michael Hoffman's ``Restoration,'' and he did a
comic turn in the Coen brothers' movie ``The Big Lebowski.'' He was
also in two films savaged by critics: Agnieszka Holland's ``Total
Eclipse,'' in which he played Verlaine to Leonardo DiCaprio's
Rimbaud, and John Frankenheimer's ``Island of Dr. Moreau,'' with
Marlon Brando, which he cheerfully called ``one of the worst films
ever made.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, as Brad Pitt's climbing companion in Jean-Jacques
Annaud's ``Seven Years in Tibet,'' Thewlis at least enjoyed
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved the experience,'' he recalled. ``A massive beautiful
adventure. I don't think it is a great film, but it was six months
in Argentina, Canada and some serious mountain climbing training in
Austria.''
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Thewlis appeared in ``Divorcing Jack,'' a comedy
about Northern Ireland's Troubles, which has not been released in
the United States. He is also preparing to play a London hoodlum in
a new movie called, ``Gangster No. 1.'' But his mind seems
elsewhere. After what he describes as a series of disastrous
relationships, he is determined to make a success of his new
relationship with a British actress.
</P>
<P>
   And to avoid disrupting it, he even postponed directing his
first film, ``Cheeky,'' for which he also wrote the screenplay.
``It's not my ambition to direct lots of films,'' he said. ``I
think if I direct one film in my whole life, why rush it?''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, at his home overlooking Hampstead Heath, he is working
on his first novel, which was commissioned by a British publisher
and has the working title of ``The Blind Man's Story.'' The
introspection required of writing seems to suit his reflective
personality. Acting, he said, is simply a convenient way of making
money while he explores other avenues. But he has not forgotten
that every film is a gamble.
</P>
<P>
   ``My next one has a great, great script,'' he said. ``That's the
sort of thing you say when you're about to start. `It's a great
script.''' He paused and smiled mischievously. ``Then when it comes
out, you say, `I don't know why I did it. It's a disaster.' You
just never know.''

PRIME MINISTER-ELECT BARAK PREACHES UNITY, PEACE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Also see Israel-Barak) 
 
By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The day after his landslide election victory, Prime
Minister-elect Ehud Barak made pilgrimages Tuesday to the holiest
site in Judaism and the grave of assassinated leader Yitzhak Rabin
_ preaching messages of national unity and peace with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``A circle has been closed here at the grave of Yitzhak Rabin,''
said Barak, 57. ``A possibility has been opened to fulfill the
legacy of Yitzhak Rabin, and I am committed to that path.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabin, who signed two peace treaties with the Palestinians, was
assassinated in 1995 by an ultranationalist opposed to giving up
land for peace.
</P>
<P>
   At the Western Wall, Judaism's most sacred site, Barak said,
``Just as we knew how to come together in the most difficult of
tests, including the painful and wrenching test of liberating
Jerusalem and returning to the Wall, it is right we should apply
this same spirit of unity to life in Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   The symbolic visits to the Western Wall _ believed to be part of
the wall that surrounded Herod's temple _ and Rabin's grave
underscored Barak's promise that he would be a leader for all
Israelis and would bring peace to the country.
</P>
<P>
   Barak won election Monday with 56 percent of the vote, ousting
conservative Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who received 43.9
percent of the vote
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-nine percent of Israel's voters turned out.
</P>
<P>
   On the day after the elections, bulldozers resumed work at two
controversial building sites in areas of Jerusalem claimed by
Palestinians, Har Homa and Ras el-Amud.
</P>
<P>
   Work at both sites had prompted Palestinian demonstrations when
they began more than a year ago and, in the case of Har Homa, led
to a breakdown in the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians, who hope to make east Jerusalem the capital of
their future state, called on Barak to halt the construction of the
Jewish housing areas being built by settlers.
</P>
<P>
   Barak is expected to begin tough negotiations Sunday to form a
coalition government that will include his One Israel Party, which
received 27 seats, making it the largest group in the 120-member
Parliament, or Knesset, and several other smaller parties.
</P>
<P>
   A potential coalition partner that appeared unlikely only 24
hours earlier was the right-wing Likud Party, headed by Netanyahu
until he resigned minutes after a grueling defeat Monday night. The
Likud won only 19 seats, down from 32 it had held in a three-way
coalition. It is the second-largest party in the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Ariel Sharon, a security hawk and foreign minister in
Netanyahu's government, was nominated as acting party head. Party
delegates will vote on a temporary leader May 25.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said he hoped to bring enough political allies into the
governing coalition to be able to move ahead with a comfortable
majority behind him when he enters talks with the Palestinians. A
broad coalition would also make it easier to reach a deal with the
Syrians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to form the widest government possible,'' said Yossi
Beilin, a top Labor Party official who helped craft the first two
peace agreements with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Other probable coalition partners included the left-wing Meretz
Party, which has nine seats; the Russian Immigrants Party, led by
Natan Sharansky, which took seven seats; the Center Party, led by
former Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, which has six seats, and
a new workers' party, which received two seats.
</P>
<P>
   It was not known whether the country's third-largest party,
Shas, would be asked to enter coalition negotiations. Shas, which
won 17 seats in the new Parliament, represents ultra-Orthodox Jews
from Middle Eastern countries.
</P>
<P>
   Several of Barak's left-wing allies have threatened to stay out
of a coalition if it invited Shas to join. The party controlled
religious matters in Netanyahu's administration, provoking the ire
of some of Israel's secular parties, including the newly formed
Shinui, or Change, Party, headed by Yosef ``Tommy'' Lapid. The
party, which advertised an anti-religious platform, won six seats
in the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Barak had said earlier that he would not begin negotiations with
Shas as long as its leader, Aryeh Deri, stayed on. He had been
convicted of corruption charges. In a surprise development Tuesday,
Deri stepped down, making it easier for Shas' other leaders to
petition Barak to join his coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Four parties are likely to remain in the opposition. They
include the pro-settlement National Religious Party, which dwindled
to five seats; the ultra-Orthodox United Torah Judaism, which also
took five seats; the ultra-nationalist Herut Party, which won three
seats, and a second Russian immigrant party, called Israel-Our
Home, which gained four seats.
</P>
<P>
   The three Arab parties _ United Arab List, Haddash and Balad _
received five, three and two seats, respectively. They are not
expected to join the government.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has 45 days to form a coalition, but many analysts
predicted that he will try to put together a government by June 7,
when the Knesset is due back in session.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Palestinian President Yasser Arafat called Barak to
congratulate him.
</P>
<P>
   Some senior Palestinian officials said they were concerned about
what they termed troubling signs that there was little substantive
difference in the basic positions held by Barak and Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barak's tough statements, which were made in the euphoria of
victory, are a source of concern for us,'' said Arafat's economic
adviser, Khaled Salam. ``They are rejected and unjustified.''

STATE'S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FOR APRIL WAS LOWEST IN 33 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BILL VIRGIN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boeing keeps cutting, job growth in the Seattle area keeps
slowing, but the state still managed to post its lowest April
unemployment rate in 33 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Employment Security Department said Tuesday the jobless rate
was 4.4 percent in April, down from 5 percent in March and just
under the 4.5 percent reported for the state in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the unemployment rate (not seasonally adjusted) was
4 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
   That 4.4 percent rate came despite another month of heavy
cutting by The Boeing Co. In fact, the aircraft and parts category
showed the heaviest month-to-month drop _ 2,600 workers _ since
Boeing began cutting back its work force 10 months ago. Aircraft
employment is now down 11,100 jobs, or 10 percent from its peak,
the department said.
</P>
<P>
   That helped pull year-to-year job growth in the Seattle
metropolitan area (defined as King, Snohomish and Island counties)
to 2 percent, meaning that job growth for the state as a whole, at
2.6 percent, is actually higher; for many months the Seattle area
was growing faster. Higher-than-normal hiring in construction and
services is credited with the expansion of overall statewide
employment.
</P>
<P>
   But if job growth is slowing, why isn't the unemployment rate in
the Seattle area budging? For April the jobless rate was 3.1
percent, down from the 3.4 percent reported for March and about
even with the 3 percent reported a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors are at work. One is that the numbers are
preliminary and could be revised. Another is that the economy is,
in fact, still growing, and there's some trickle-down effect from
expansion in industries like aerospace and software. Unemployment
usually drops in spring and summer anyway, as seasonal businesses
open and start hiring.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor is that job growth and the unemployment rate
aren't directly connected. As Roberta Pauer, the department's
regional labor economist for the Seattle area, noted in a recent
analysis, the unemployment rate merely measures the number of
unemployed workers, divided by the size of the labor force _
including those who are employed as well as those seeking work. The
number of jobs in the area isn't directly a part of the
calculation.
</P>
<P>
   Both components of the unemployment rate are affected by people
moving into or out of the region, Pauer wrote. Because the economy
in the rest of the country is doing well, there are fewer people
being pushed to this area without jobs but looking for work. News
of Boeing cuts, meanwhile, reduces the pull of those coming to this
region without a job already lined up.
</P>
<P>
   From April 1998 to April 1999, the Seattle -area's labor force
grew at just 1.8 percent. From April 1997 to April 1998, the labor
force grew at 3.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a Puget Sound labor force growing much more modestly than
a few years ago as in-migration has subsided, our local
unemployment rate remains low despite our slowing economy,'' she
added.
</P>
<P>
   The unemployment rate for Tacoma and Pierce County was 4 percent
in April, down from 4.6 percent in March and 4.4 percent in April
1998. In Bremerton and Kitsap County, the jobless rate was 4.6
percent in April, 5.1 percent in March and 5 percent a year ago.

 &HT;    Students return to Ohio school where bottle bomb exploded
 &HT;    By Margo Rutledge Kissell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENE COUNTY, Ohio _ It wasn't the upbeat motivational speech
Ben Holaday had planned to deliver to the Ankeney Junior High
School students.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, tears welled in his eyes at times as he stood Tuesday
before about 285 ninth-graders sitting on gymnasium bleachers, one
day after a bottle bomb exploded in the Beavercreek school's
crowded cafeteria, causing the 880-student school to be evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   No students or teachers were injured, but a security guard
suffered minor burns when she touched the device that two students
allegedly made and brought to school. The teens _ a 16-year-old boy
and a 14-year-old boy _ were charged with delinquency counts of
inducing panic and criminal damaging. They remain in the Greene
County Juvenile Detention Center and are scheduled to be arraigned
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   While Holaday, a former police officer, has spent the past 10
years giving motivational talks to hundreds of thousands of kids
across the country, Monday's incident hit close to home for him:
His 15-year-old son, Ben, is a ninth-grader at Ankeney. Holaday
told the students he was ``absolutely terrified'' when he saw a
news helicopter hovering near the school and arrived to find police
and fire trucks there and the school cordoned off with yellow
police tape.
</P>
<P>
   School officials said about 25 students more than normal were
absent from school Tuesday and Holaday said fear probably kept them
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to let fear control us and we are not going
to let this incident change our way of life and make us afraid,''
he told students in the warm gymnasium that was so quiet throughout
his 30-minute speech that one could hear the hum from the ceiling
lights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to become a bunch of scared deer lifting our
head up at every sound that goes on and we are not going to run in
fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Ninth-grader Emily Reinhart, 15, was moved by Holaday's speech.
``I think he really hit home for some people,'' she said, adding
she still feels safe at the school.
</P>
<P>
   Principal David Elliott told the students that two suspects
spent the night behind bars and appeared in court Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are not going to see them anymore. They won't be back here
this year,'' he told seventh-, eighth- and ninth-grade assemblies.
Suspension hearings have not yet been held, school officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Beavercreek Police Sgt. George Moody said the 14-year-old came
to the police station Monday evening with his parents to turn
himself in. Greene County Juvenile Court Judge Robert Hutcheson on
Tuesday returned the two students to the detention center until
Thursday's arraignment.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys representing the teens said neither has had
significant disciplinary problems in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Hutcheson, who already had five other Greene County students
come before him for making serious threats at school in recent
weeks, suggested parents need to have frank discussions with their
children about the implications of such threats because of
heightened awareness since the Littleton, Colo., tragedy, where 15
died.
</P>
<P>
   ``The panic button gets pushed when these stunts get pulled. It
keeps everyone on edge,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Prosecutor Sigurd Peterson said authorities think the
two teens worked together to create the homemade bottle bomb
containing some sort of chemical cleaning agent that will be
analyzed at the Miami Valley Crime Lab.
</P>
<P>
   ``They filled the bottle before going to school and then went to
school and did some final preparations, then placed the bottle in
the trash can in the cafeteria and shortly thereafter there was the
explosion,'' Peterson said. ``This was not something done on the
spur of the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The teens could be committed to the Department of Youth Services
until age 21 if convicted of inducing panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It caused panic throughout the entire school, it had to be
evacuated. Given the current situation, I think the school and
everyone responded very appropriately to this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott told the students they will have school every day until
the end of the school year, June 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are the people who will determine what the last 22 days of
school are like, whether they are going to be peaceful days or
whether they are going to be chaotic days,'' Elliott said.

JUDGE ALLOWS PARALYZED WOMAN TO DIE; MOTHER FACES MURDER CHARGE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Georgette Smith will be allowed to die, as she
wishes, but not until she helps prosecutors build a murder case
against her own mother, who she said has robbed her of the will to
live.
</P>
<P>
   A Florida judge ruled Tuesday that the 42-year-old Ms. Smith,
who was left paralyzed from the neck down in March when her
68-year-old mother shot her in the spine, will be allowed to have
her life support disconnected on Wednesday after 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, doctors will remove from Ms. Smith the ventilator
that is keeping her alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``God, don't leave me this way,'' Ms. Smith pleaded to the judge
in her deposition, saying she understood that her decision was
expected to result in murder charges against her mother, Shirley
Egan. Police say Ms. Egan shot her daughter on March 8 when she
heard her say that she wanted to place her in a nursing home. Ms.
Egan remains in custody.
</P>
<P>
   After Lucerne Medical Center, where she is a patient, refused to
disconnect her life support, Ms. Smith sued to compel them to let
her die. She got what she wanted here Tuesday in Orange County
Court when Judge Richard Conrad ruled that she could be taken off a
ventilator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ms. Smith has made a difficult choice, a choice which she has
the right to make,'' Conrad wrote, in his ruling. ``This court has
found that she is competent to make that choice.''
</P>
<P>
   But the judge ruled that she must wait until 5 p.m. on
Wednesday. That will give prosecutors, who spent 45 minutes
interviewing Ms. Smith in the hospital Tuesday, more time to
interview her and gather evidence in what is expected to be one of
the most unusual legal battles in this state's history.
</P>
<P>
   Although the judge issued an order barring both sides in the
case from speaking about it, prosecutors here have said they will
likely file murder charges against Ms. Egan, who has already been
charged with attempted first-degree murder and aggravated battery
causing great bodily harm.
</P>
<P>
   An Orange County grand jury is expected to decide sometime in
the coming moths if Ms. Egan, a frail, 4-foot-11, 85-pound woman
who is blind in one eye, can be tried for killing her daughter when
it was her daughter's decision to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can do is wink my eyes, wiggle my nose and wiggle my
tongue,'' Ms. Smith said in the written deposition her lawyers
submitted last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't move any other part of my body. I want to die because
I can't live this way,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It is a case of immense sadness, said investigators and family
members, and perhaps the first of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   While there have been many cases in which a criminal's actions
led, after months or years, to suicides or death from lingering
effects from an attack _ leading to murder indictments and
convictions _ it might, legal experts say, be the first in which a
person of sound mind has chosen to be unhooked from life support,
knowing the consequences of the act to herself, and her attacker.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Ms. Smith was shot on March 8 in the Rosewood
Village Apartments in Orlando when she, her boyfriend and Ms. Egan
were talking about placing the elderly woman, who had emphysema and
had recently been hurt in a car crash, in a nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Smith stepped away to get paperwork on a nursing home,
Ms. Egan fired a handgun at her, prosecutors said. It is not clear
how she got the gun.
</P>
<P>
   The bullet lodged in her neck and severed her spine at the
second vertebra. Then Ms. Egan fired the gun again, this time at
Ms. Smith's boyfriend, Larry Videlock, barely missing him, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Ms. Egan has said the elderly woman did not mean to
hurt her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith can speak, but only with great effort, but is unable
to swallow and must be fed by a tube. She has no control of her
bodily functions, and is at risk, doctors said, of pneumonia,
ulcers, infections and bed sores.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said her condition is irreversible, and a psychiatric
evaluation found her to be mentally competent.
</P>
<P>
   Her daughters, Candace Smith, 22, and Joeleen Hill, 19, said it
was their mother's choice to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``She doesn't want to finish her life this way,'' said Candace
Smith in court last week.
</P>
<P>
   Their mother's death, if prosecutors follow through on their
plans to file murder charges, will be the beginning of a legal
struggle over intent, and responsibility: Did Ms. Egan end her
daughter's life, even though it was her daughter's decision to die?
</P>
<P>
   David Orentlicher, a professor of law at Indiana University and
co-director of the Center for Law and Health, said there is a long
history of murder charges and convictions stemming from crimes that
did not immediately result in death. In the late 1800s, a man was
injured in the leg by another man, refused to have his leg
amputated when gangrene set in, and died. His attacker was
convicted of murder.
</P>
<P>
   And in the 1930s, a woman who was raped later committed suicide
because she could not live with the shame. Her attacker was
convicted of murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``This looks pretty clear,'' said Orentlicher. ``The law points
in that direction'' of a successful prosecution for murder in the
Florida case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, are they doing something that is so
unreasonable that it's not fair to blame to shooter,'' he said.
``In this case, we've got a well-recognized reason for refusing
treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Some legal experts disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be held responsible for someone else's death unless
you cause that death,'' said Peter Arenella, a professor of
criminal law at the University of California in Los Angeles. ``The
daughter made a conscious decision to end her life, and should be
held to be the actual cause of death. It would be difficult for
prosecutors to persuade jurors that the attack caused her death.''
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Brafman, a prominent New York City defense lawyers,
agrees. ``It would be a very difficult legal theory,'' he said of
the prosecution. ``Because an argument could be made that an
affirmative decision to end the life is a not a direct consequence
of the shooting, but the result of an intervening force.''

 WASHINGTON: its campaign. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clinton said that while he believed NATO's airstrikes had been
effective, ``I don't think that we or our allies should take any
options off the table and that has been my position from the
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton has said from the March 24 start of the air war that
he had ``no intention'' of sending ground forces into a hostile
environment in the Balkans. As he explained in an interview on
March 31, ``The thing that bothers me about introducing ground
troops into a hostile situation _ into Kosovo and into the Balkans
_ is the prospect of never being able to get them out.''
</P>
<P>
   And three weeks ago he squelched an attempt by Britain to
reintroduce the topic at the NATO summit in Washington. Asked at a
news conference April 24 if a buildup of troops was preparation for
a ground invasion, the president said, ``No. The short answer is
no.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's disinclination to use ground troops has been
sufficiently clear that numerous military analysts, and retired
Gen. Colin Powell, have criticized the position as a strategic
blunder for signaling to the enemy just how far the allies would
go.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman, asserted Tuesday that
the president was not shifting his position.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it's prudent to always consider all of your options and
stay updated, which we are, given the assessments that are going
on, there's no change in our policy,'' he said. ``The president
believes we're going to get to where we need to get through the air
campaign and that we will get the conditions that we've laid out.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that the air campaign was effective because it was
driving Milosevic toward negotiations. ``You've seen reports today
out of Belgrade that senior government officials are talking about
wanting a diplomatic solution, trying to find a way out,'' Lockhart
said. ``It's because the campaign is working.''
</P>
<P>
   But the administration is concerned, as Clinton said last week,
that ``refugee fatigue'' may be settling in among the public, and a
new poll from the Pew Research Center shows that while a majority
of Americans still support the war, that support has ebbed over the
last month. The Pew survey reflects similar findings in other polls
conducted recently.
</P>
<P>
   Approval of American participation in the conflict has fallen to
53 percent from 62 percent in mid-April, the poll found. Fewer
Americans _ 32 percent _ are paying very close attention to the war
now than were just three weeks ago, and among them, support has
dropped 21 percent so that a majority now oppose airstrikes
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public is really wavering,'' said Andrew Kohut, director
of the center. ``That wavering is a combination of concern about
the unintended casualties and that the public doesn't think we're
winning.'' The public is almost evenly divided over whether to send
ground troops, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who has been a strong critic of the
administration's reluctance to use ground force, said that he
believed Clinton would seek some sort of settlement before sending
in ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're under great pressure,'' McCain, who is seeking the
Republican nomination for president, said in an interview Tuesday.
``I think they'll frantically seek a deal _ a dirty compromise _
and spin it and hope the Dow continues to go up. The whole thing is
very dispiriting.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberals too are adding their voice to the call for ground
troops. Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said ground troops would be needed
to force Milosevic to yield to bend to NATO demands. ``I am not
convinced that air power alone will get his forces out of Kosovo,''
Harkin said Tuesday after a three-day trip to the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   But Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster, said that these polls
``are making a mountain out of a molehill of changes in public
opinion.'' He added, ``You have some high-profile things like the
Chinese embassy thing and it causes a blip. Nobody's enthusiastic
about war. But there is certainly not anything like majority
opposition.

   The SEC, which in recent months has stepped up its effort to
patrol the burgeoning online trading industry, said Datek Online
had failed to properly separate its customers accounts from the
company's operations and that at times Datek officials had shifted
as much as $50 million a day from various customer accounts to
settle other customer trades and to pay company bills.
</P>
<P>
   While no customer money was lost, the improper record-keeping _
which included falsifying a financial document that records the
amount of capital on hand _ did put customer money at greater risk,
the SEC said.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC fined Datek $50,000. The company was also censured and
ordered to hire an outside financial consultant to review its
internal procedures. The SEC also fined former Datek chief
financial officer Moishe Zelcer $10,000 and suspended him from the
brokerage industry for 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   Datek officials said Tuesday that as a result of the SEC inquiry
last year, the company responded quickly and reformed its
back-office operations by hiring new accountants and managers and
removing Zelcer, a longtime Datek official. Zelcer was not
dismissed, a spokesman said, though he is currently obeying a
90-day SEC suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the sanctions against the company raise troubling
questions about the financial integrity of a fast-growing online
brokerage firm that has also petitioned the SEC about transforming
its booming electronic-trading system, the Island ECN, into an
independent stock exchange that could someday rival the New York
Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year ago, Datek called off a much-anticipated
initial public offering amid accusations that it had taken part in
a money-laundering operation that was being investigated by the
office of the Manhattan district attorney. Around the same time,
the SEC was investigating whether Datek had encouraged illegal
trading practices at its former day-trading unit, and whether it
was involved in falsifying its financial and trading records,
according to former Datek traders who had been interviewed by the
SEC.
</P>
<P>
   Datek began as a small Brooklyn brokerage firm that specialized
in day trading and developed a long history of fines and
suspensions related to, among other things, manipulating the stocks
of small companies. It is now attempting to leap into the big
leagues as an online broker known for innovative technology and
fast trading executions _ thus its popularity with day traders.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, Datek has brought in new managers, hoping to
polish its image as a major online brokerage firm with ambitions to
turn the Island ECN into a major electronic stock exchange that
could change the way the market operates. Earlier this year, the
company hired Edward Nicoll, co-founder of Waterhouse Securities,
as its chief operating officer and John Mullin, another Waterhouse
executive, as president.
</P>
<P>
   Waterhouse Securities, which is owned by Toronto Dominion Bank,
also formed an alliance with Datek by investing $25 million for a
12.5 percent stake in the Island ECN, a so-called electronic
commerce network.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bethge, a spokesman for Datek, which is based in Iselin,
N.J., said that the moves by management were part of an effort to
strengthen the fast-growing company with seasoned veterans and new
management practices.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1998, however, the SEC said there had been 12
occasions when Datek used customer funds to ``meet its own
obligations.'' And on 12 occasions Datek failed to maintain the
minimum required balance in its customer account _ a detail that
puts customer money at greater risk in the event of a sharp market
swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customer money is supposed to be put aside, and they used some
of that money,'' said Henry Klehm, an associate director at the SEC
in New York. ``These back-office and customer protection rules are
very important to the financial integrity of the firm.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency also said Datek kept inaccurate books and records,
such as general ledgers, and that it did not maintain a required
electronic record that could not be altered.
</P>
<P>
   Bethge, though, said the financial errors had been made in
``good faith'' and were unintentional. ``They were just flawed
calculations,'' he said. ``And they caused a ripple effect to other
numbers.'' He added: ``We take this seriously; this is not
something we're trying to minimize. We've gone through a lot to
make sure it doesn't happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Though back-office operations are technical, regulators say they
are essential to insuring that fast-growing companies like Datek _
which saw its business surge by 49 percent in the first quarter of
this year _ have enough money in downturns or during slower
business cycles.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Burnham, an online analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston,
said that some of the problems go beyond Datek, though he says the
brokerage firm had less access to capital than other online
brokers, several of whom have the financial backing of major Wall
Street firms or deep-pocketed private investors.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham said, though, that he was confident about Datek, partly
because of the management changes. ``I guess they grew so fast,
they forgot about maintaining their capital,'' he said. ``All these
firms have had trouble keeping pace with growth.''

 &HT;    Ohio Senator calls for bombing stoppage
 &HT;    By Scott Montgomery
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. George Voinovich returned from a weekend in
the Balkans and by renewed his call for an immediate halt in the
bombing campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Republican has sternly opposed the NATO strategy
of using bombs to get Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to
relinquish military control of Kosovo, and said Tuesday that peace
should be given another chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is that we have nothing to lose,'' Voinovich said,
``and at least we can say we've given that one another try.''
</P>
<P>
   Voinovich, who is of Serbian and Slovenia ancestry, spent three
days meeting with officials in Bulgaria and Turkey _ two border
countries _ in addition to visiting a refugee camp in Albania and a
military briefing in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   He said leaders of neighboring countries told him they oppose a
ground war, which has been contemplated, but no provisions have
been made for invasion. They're eager to see the hostilities end at
the bargaining table, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In effect, the whole region's economy has been shut down,''
Voinovich said.
</P>
<P>
   Voinovich echoed the concerns of others who have traveled to the
Balkans, including U.S. Rep. Tony Hall (D-Dayton, Ohio) in saying
that the tens of thousands of ethnic Albanians living in tent
cities will need more food and other provisions as their time in
the camps drags on.
</P>
<P>
   And on Tuesday, U.S. Rep. David L. Hobson (R-Springfield, Ohio)
announced that he will lead a group on a weekend trip to the
region.
</P>
<P>
   But Voinovich wasn't swayed from his opposition to the air war
after visiting a refugee camp. He said he told NATO Commander Gen.
Wesley Clark that he wants to stop the bombing long enough to spark
peace talks, but Clark told him he would oppose relenting on the
air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Voinovich wants NATO to drop leaflets on Belgrade, explaining
that the war is not against them but their leader. By taking a
``five or six'' day break in the bombing, Voinovich said NATO would
be showing the Serbian people that they aren't the targets of the
military action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be pausing to let things develop diplomatically,''
Voinovich said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that Milosevic might be willing to end his military
crusade to clear Albanians out of Kosovo if NATO appeals to the
``better instincts of the man'' by halting the air war.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bombing has been very effective,'' Voinovich said. ``He
can see the handwriting on the wall and this could be a way for him
to extricate himself from the situation and save face.''
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Voinovich said, the only option is to pound away with
no end in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been 55 days and nothing has changed,'' he said. ``How
many more? Ten? Fifteen? Thirty days?''

GALAXY CROWDS THINNING OUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles Galaxy crowds are looking more and
more like those old Los Angeles Aztecs crowds of the 1970's.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, Aztec players would kick soccer balls into the stands
for fans to keep. The crowds were so small at the Rose Bowl, I
would pick an empty section and have a free ball awaiting me.
</P>
<P>
   There are no free balls anymore, but take away the Galaxy's
first two games -- the season opener (17,343) and its doubleheader
with the U.S. Women's National team (27,034) -- and what do you
have left?
</P>
<P>
   Aztec-type crowds.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy has averaged 10,967 its past three games, far short
of its combined average of 17,795 the first three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   When San Jose and El Salvadoran Raul Diaz Arce came to the Rose
Bowl April 3 for a head-to-head meeting with fellow Salvadoran
Mauricio Cienfuegos of the Galaxy, L.A. drew 16,700.
</P>
<P>
   But against Columbus on April 8, a record-low 4,825 were on
hand. And Saturday, 11,378 were in attendance with Carlos
Valderrama and Tampa Bay in town.
</P>
<P>
   Bart Brown, past president of the East L.A. Futbol Foundation
and director of player development for the non-profit L.A. Soccer
foundation, has an explanation for the recent decline.
</P>
<P>
   Brown feels that since Denver-based billionaire Philip F.
Anschutz purchased the club for $26 million in October, the Galaxy
has distanced itself from the Hispanic community. Therefore, he
says, the Hispanic community has distanced itself from the Galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The silence from the Spanish-speaking press has been
deafening,'' Brown said. ``A shame equaled only by the new Galaxy's
disdain for the Hispanic market.''
</P>
<P>
   When Galaxy President Tim Leiweke was introduced last October,
many wondered how the Galaxy would market itself to the Spanish
audience. During the Galaxy's first three seasons, former Galaxy
president Daniel Villanueva had strong ties to the Spanish
community.
</P>
<P>
   He built the team around the makeup of the city. In 1996, it had
an Ecuadoran (Eduardo Hurtado), El Salvadoran (Mauricio Cienfuegos)
and a Mexican (Jorge Campos).
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Villanueva acquired Guatemalan Martin Machon and also
brought in Mexican scoring champion Carlos Hermosillo last season.
</P>
<P>
   Only Hermosillo and Cienfuegos remain and Hermosillo doesn't
return to the team until next month.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Leiweke promised the Hispanic audience wouldn't be
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not an idiot; I look at the fan base,'' Leiweke said at
the time. ``The Hispanic community is No. 1. We start there and we
end there and although there are other parts of the fan base we
have to pat attention to, I want the Hispanic community to
understand they have my full attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Do they? Leiweke is no different than a lot of MLS' executives,
who admit their soccer knowledge is limited.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer America's Paul Gardener suggested that MLS' governing
body ``is devoid of anyone with a deep knowledge of the sport it's
supposed to be promoting.''
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy general manager Sergio Del Prado said that season ticket
sales from last year are almost identical to this season. In fact,
they are exactly four tickets shy of last season's total on season
ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of fans, however, stem from walk-up sales. And walk-up
sales generally come from the Hispanic market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've looked at that (lack of Hispanic sales) and it's a huge
concern on our part,'' said Del Prado. ``The Hispanic crowd was a
crowd that came without the Galaxy courting it or doing anything
(in years past). We have been advertising in the Hispanic media,
but until Hermosillo gets here, we'll do everything we can to reach
that crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be hard with only Cienfuegos as its only marquee foreign
attraction in the mean time.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Galaxy has a foreign roster spot available for
the team to exercise, Del Prado doesn't expect it to be filled by a
marquee Hispanic player this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a perfect world that would be the solution,'' Del Prado
said about introducing a recognized foreigner. ``But I don't think
this late in the season we'll find one impact player for both our
team and our attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even without a star player from their (Hispanics) homeland, I
think that (Hispanic) crowd is price-conscious for one. And they're
also very fickle as to how we're performing on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting more Hispanic families, but we're missing the
17- to 30-year-old male who's out with his buddies.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if the Galaxy starts winning and scoring, maybe
everything would change. It doesn't help that they're the worst
scoring team in the league (five goals in nine games) with 4-5
mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you win, people show up,'' said Del Prado. ``We'll have
to see what happens when they turn it around.''
</P>
<P>
   MLS vice president of player relations Ivan Gazidis said the
league is still working on a way for Los Angeles to sign former
UCLA striker Seth George, drafted by the Galaxy in the second round
of the 1999 college draft.
</P>
<P>
   George is not with the 1860 Munich German club he signed with
after college, but the club still owns his rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``No progress ... Seth is under contract in Europe,'' said
Gazidis. ``We don't propose to pay a transfer fee. Right now we're
waiting for that situation to resolve itself, but we're hopeful.''
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy also released 17-year-old Ecuadoran Jaime Estupian,
leaving a foreign slot available, but as Del Prado suggested, there
are no immediate plans to replace him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Galaxy has not asked us about a player,'' said Gazidis.

 HP Unfurls Its Battle Plan for Storming Into E-Commerce
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Henry Norr &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Internet commerce is moving to a new stage, according to
Hewlett-Packard, and this time around, the Palo Alto computer giant
aims to play a starring role.
</P>
<P>
   A day after releasing an unexpectedly strong earnings report for
its second fiscal quarter, the company yesterday rolled out a new
vision, new technologies and new buzzwords for what HP executives
called ``Internet Chapter 2.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategy focuses on providing tools for building
``e-services,'' sophisticated new online sites that will make it
easier for companies and end users to find the goods and services
that best meet their changing needs.
</P>
<P>
   One element of the plan is ``apps on tap,'' software services
such as accounting and inventory management that businesses could
use over the Web as needed. Instead of having to buy, install and
manage all the necessary software on their own machines, they would
pay on the basis of actual usage. HP officials called the scheme
``outsourcing your incompetences.''
</P>
<P>
   One example is e-mail, which is increasingly critical for many
companies yet also increasingly difficult to manage. HP said it has
formed alliances with both Microsoft and PSINet, a large
business-oriented Internet service provider, to offer e-mail
services to other companies tired of the hassle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been a major player on the Internet all along,'' said
Lewis Platt, HP's soon-to-retire CEO. ``But it's true we haven't
been very good at merchandising what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's announcements were intended to change all that. The
new strategy, worked out over the past six months, has ``spread
like wildfire'' through the company, giving its diverse businesses
a common direction, Platt said.
</P>
<P>
   One key piece of the new plan is a software technology called
``E-speak,'' which will allow Web developers to knit together
different applications to perform complex tasks.
</P>
<P>
   Companies or users who want to make travel arrangements via the
Web, for example, typically have to check several sites to compare
availability and prices for airline tickets, hotel rooms, car
rentals and entertainment options. And if the trip has to be
postponed, the user has to go back and start all over again.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, the user only would need enter a description of
the planned trip, and E-speak-enabled software automatically would
locate all sites offering relevant services and select those that
best match the customer's goals and priorities.
</P>
<P>
   If a flight is canceled or delayed, the software automatically
would offer the user a choice of several alternative plans, then
make all the new reservations and arrangements required.
</P>
<P>
   ``E-speak is only a conceptual architecture at this point,''
said Harry Fenik, vice president of Zona Research in Redwood City.
``It's a good one, in the sense that this is the kind of thing that
needs to be done, but it remains to be seen whether this framework
or something else will become ubiquitous.''
</P>
<P>
   E-speak is based on technology that's been under development in
HP labs for more than five years, officials said. But the company
doesn't intend to keep it to itself: It already has posted the
basic software code on the Web, and late this year, it plans to
release an open-source version that customers and even competitors
will be able to build into their own products.
</P>
<P>
   How then will HP make money on the technology? Part of the
answer, according to Ann Livermore, chief executive of HP's
Enterprise Computing Business, is that innovative Web business will
see that HP understands their needs so will look to it for other
products, such as servers and security and management software.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a whole new set of baby gorillas out there, and we
want to help them grow up to be the 800-pound kind,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, according to Livermore, HP is developing new
business models under which it will provide hardware, software and
services in exchange for a percentage of the customer's revenues
from online transactions. It's relatively easy for HP to move to
the new model because it already has its own financing business _
an advantage many of its competitors lack.
</P>
<P>
   Archrival Sun Microsystems, for example, can't make
transaction-based deals of this kind because it has no financing
arm, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sun is sitting kind of stuck in a boat without a paddle,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Monday's positive earnings report, HP closed at
$96, up $7.25, after flirting with a high of $97.56.

 Sharper Image Shelves Plan to Sharpen Image
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Carol Emert &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
The new president of Sharper Image said yesterday that the firm has
suspended plans to redesign its stores because the updated look
hasn't improved sales.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Wan, now second in command after founder and chief
executive Richard Thalheimer, said the San Francisco electronic
gadget retailer also has scaled back its store-opening plans for
this year to five new stores from 10 because it can't afford the
high rents landlords are asking.
</P>
<P>
   ``There hasn't been any lift in comps to justify'' more
remodels, said Wan, referring to comparable-store sales, or sales
at stores that have been open one year or more, the primary gauge
of retail success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure why'' the more spacious-feeling beige stores are
not selling more merchandise than the old gray ones, said Wan, a
veteran Sharper Image executive who was promoted last month from
chief operating officer to president and chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Sharper Image opened four new stores and remodeled
five. It will continue to remodel existing stores when required for
lease renewals, and it will build stores at new locations in the
updated style. Currently, just 11 of the 89 Sharper Image stores
have the new look.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Gassman, an analyst with Davenport &AMP; Co., said he likes
the clean, new design of the stores, which like the old ones sell
gizmos such as a self-cleaning cat litter box, a CD player that can
be played in the shower, and an inflatable kayak. The problem seems
to be that there isn't enough merchandise on the shelf, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the theory was that they would reduce the amount of
product per square foot, so people would focus on particular items,
play with them and buy them,'' said Gassman. ``That may have
happened, but I think they may have gone overboard with lowering
the product density.''
</P>
<P>
   Comparable store sales have been erratic, declining in January
and February and then jumping 10 percent in March and 11 percent in
April. Wan attributed problems early in the year to shortages of
hot items. She said she does not expect double-digit sales
increases to continue.
</P>
<P>
   For fiscal 1998, comparable store sales rose a healthy 5.3
percent, up from 1.1 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Direct-mail sales, which last year accounted for 29 percent of
Sharper Image's $243 million in revenues, were hurt earlier this
year when the company cut catalog costs in an attempt to get a
higher return, Wan said.
</P>
<P>
   The January-February catalog was cut to 52 pages from 84, and
fewer catalogs were mailed. But sales declined along with costs,
leaving the return flat, said Wan. The catalogs now are back to
their original size and circulation levels, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wan said her goals for this year are to expand Sharper Image's
distribution system before the Christmas season, to make its Web
site more customer friendly and to expand sales of products
developed in-house.
</P>
<P>
   Those proprietary products, which carry higher margins than
merchandise bought from outside vendors, constitute 8 percent of
Sharper Image sales in 1997 and 18 percent in 1998. The company
currently is achieving its target of 25 percent for 1999, said Wan.
</P>
<P>
   Sharper Image's Web site continues to rack up strong sales,
growing in triple digits each month since February. Web sales last
year totaled $4.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sharper Image is preparing for a Web sale of leftover
merchandise from its Home Collection catalog, which was
discontinued earlier this year amid plummeting sales.
</P>
<P>
   The Home Collection failed in part because it was too difficult
and expensive to ship large pieces of furniture, said Wan. But she
said smaller pieces might sell well over the Web.

TWO PLAYS ILLUMINATE EACH OTHER AND THEIR AUTHOR  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 23) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By VINCENT CANBY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The British playwright David Hare, now at the Booth Theater in
``Via Dolorosa,'' his own one-man play about the Arab-Israeli
stalemate, reports with some amused chagrin Dame Judi Dench's
response to his performance, which marks his debut as a
professional actor.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks away, Dame Judi, a longtime pro and a legitimate
Dame, is starring in Hare's ``Amy's View'' at the Ethel Barrymore.
Though both productions were hits in London earlier, Dame Judi
apparently hadn't had a chance to catch ``Via Dolorosa'' until she
came to New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's been saying to me for some time now,'' Hare told James
Barron of The New York Times, ``that I must write a play in which
we can act'' together. Though after seeing ``Via Dolorosa,'' he
said, she seemed to have cooled on the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mmm,'' Hare quoted her as having said, ``I don't think I want
to be in a play with you. You don't act. There's not a single
choice you make in the course of an evening that any professional
actor would make. It's moving, but I don't feel that what I do and
what you do have any professional kinship.''
</P>
<P>
   This sounds very much like good-natured ribbing from an admiring
star who may have received a certain amount of constructive
criticism from the playwright during rehearsals, possibly through
Richard Eyre, the director.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it also calls attention to Hare's approach to theater and,
indeed, to the vast differences between ``Via Dolorosa'' and to
virtually every other Hare play American audiences have had the
opportunity to see. That would recently include not only ``Amy's
View,'' but also ``The Judas Kiss,'' a consideration of the fate of
Oscar Wilde, which opened in New York just a year ago, and, to a
somewhat lesser extent, ``The Blue Room.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the playwright's chilly, sardonic variation on ``La
Ronde,'' the Schnitzler classic, in which a discreetly nude Nicole
Kidman helped to sell out a limited Broadway engagement earlier
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Seldom has the latest work of an established playwright been
available in such quantity on Broadway within such a short period
of time. For many of us, it has been a learning experience of the
sort that only repertory theaters can offer. It is as if Hare had
decided to supplement three more or less conventional plays
(``Amy's View,'' ``The Blue Room'' and ``The Judas Kiss'') with a
fascinating, extended career footnote (``Via Dolorosa'').
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, he allows us free entry into the mind _ the
playwright's hidden storage vault _ where he keeps the raw material
that later goes into his plays.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, of course, ``Via Dolorosa'' is no footnote. It is a
major work in its own right: not fiction but reportage, being
Hare's first-person account of his three fact-finding trips to
Israel and the West Bank when he was pondering the writing of a
play to illustrate the problems there. Somewhere along the way,
however, he decided that what he calls ``theater of fiction'' would
not be adequate to the task.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he wrote a 90-minute monologue in which he, as himself,
an uncommitted, skeptical outsider, a native of a land where
passion has become theoretical, reports on the religious, ethnic,
social and economic contradictions that have led to this most
passionate of stalemates.
</P>
<P>
   Dame Judi is right. Hare doesn't portray himself with the skill
and nuances that a pro might bring to the role, which is all to the
good. There is nothing seductive about his performance that might
distance the audience from the full import of what he is saying.
Yet he brings to intense, dramatic life the dozens of remarkable
characters he meets en route, all the while keeping up a running
commentary of his own thoughts, which issue from a mind infinitely
curious and committed only to common sense and justice. Such are
the luxuries, he acknowledges, available to the outsider passing
through.
</P>
<P>
   Now, New Yorkers have the luxury of seeing ``Amy's View'' and
``Via Dolorosa'' back to back in such a way that each serves to
illuminate the other. You have to make your plans quickly, though:
``Via Dolorosa,'' which is directed by Stephen Daldry, closes on
June 13.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Amy's View,'' Hare has created fictional characters into
which, like a ventriloquist, he throws his disguised voice to make
points that are often dramatic but not always consistent with the
characters who express them. On the other hand, there is never any
doubt in ``Via Dolorosa'' about the validity of the characters or
about the playwright's reactions to them. Writing in the first
person, he is a superb reporter with a gift for locating the vivid
detail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amy's View'' is an updated version of the kind of star vehicle
I associate with the pre-World War II American theater. That was
when actresses on the order of Katherine Cornell, Tallulah Bankhead
and Ina Claire wouldn't be caught dead onstage at the curtain's
rise, but would make great, sweeping dramatic entrances intended to
provoke adoring applause.
</P>
<P>
   Dame Judi's entrance in ``Amy's View'' is not quite so
self-conscious, but the buildup for it is perfectly timed and the
response to it warm. The performance that follows is big, showy
and, I suspect, infinitely satisfying to American audiences. They
are ready to salute the star who played Queen Victoria in ``Mrs.
Brown'' (for which she should have received the Oscar last year)
and this year's Oscar-winning best-supporting actress for
``Shakespeare in Love,'' in which she plays Queen Elizabeth I.
</P>
<P>
   Dame Judi doesn't disappoint. Hare has written a rich role for
her in ``Amy's View'': Esme Allen, a great, dedicated star of the
London theater whose daughter, Amy, falls fatally in love with a
young man named Dominic who represents everything crass in
contemporary culture. In the 16 years covered by the play, Dominic,
a part-time correspondent for tabloid journals, hustles his way
first to celebrity as a television arts critic and then to
financial and critical success as a director of movies that are
described as if they might be Quentin Tarantino spinoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amy's View'' is actually about more things than can easily be
absorbed in one viewing, though it reads more coherently than it
plays. Among other things, it's about Esme's abiding faith in the
theater as opposed to Dominic's commitment to getting ahead in the
more popular arts. Theater is mind and conscience. Movies and
television are pure sensation.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Hare explores Esme's horror that Amy should
marry Dominic in full acceptance of the fact that he can never love
her to the degree that she loves him, which is a brief replay of
the theme spelled out at somewhat greater length in ``The Judas
Kiss.''
</P>
<P>
   Rapacious capitalism, as exemplified by Lloyd's of London, also
figures prominently in a plot that seems to wander from one
would-be big emotional scene to another until the end. At that
point, magically, Hare delivers a coda that helps to make all that
has gone before seem worthwhile.

 S.F. D.A. Probing Providian
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Sam Zuckerman &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Providian Financial Corp., the giant San Francisco credit card
lender that targets customers with tarnished credit histories, is
under investigation for possible consumer fraud by the city
district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The allegations are that there are unfair business
practices,'' district attorney's office spokesman Clarence Johnson
said. ``This is something that came to our attention several months
ago. We got a lot of complaints.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors haven't collected enough evidence yet to determine
whether to level criminal charges against Providian, the nation's
ninth-largest credit card issuer and one of the city's fastest
growing financial businesses. If the office decides not to
prosecute, it could file a civil suit or drop the matter entirely,
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to specify what alleged abuses the district
attorney's office is probing, except to say they involve a range of
practices in the sale of credit cards, disclosure of terms and
collection of debt.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the probe, Providian spokeswoman Laurie Cole said in
a prepared statement: ``If the district attorney's office is
conducting an investigation, we will cooperate fully.''
</P>
<P>
   Cole said, ``We're confident we are in compliance with all laws
and regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   The probe of Providian, first reported by KRON-TV, comes as
credit card issuers nationwide face heightened scrutiny. Consumer
groups accuse them of boosting profits by loading up on late
charges and other fees, while concealing from customers vital
information about their accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is considering amendments to federal bankruptcy
legislation, supported by the Clinton administration, that would
require credit card issuers to display terms more prominently on
applications, including information about fees.
</P>
<P>
   Providian was created in 1997 when a Kentucky insurance company
spun off its consumer finance unit. The company established itself
as a credit card powerhouse by doing business with customers of
different credit ratings while specializing in those with poor
credit records. Providian has a reputation for finding innovative
ways of squeezing payments from them.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock has more than doubled in the last 18 months,
as Providian has jumped from 12th to ninth place among credit card
lenders nationwide, according to the Nilson Report, a trade
publication.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, though, Providian has become a lightning rod for
consumer anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the distinction of creating more consumer complaints
than any other company in the Bay Area,'' said Pat Wallace,
president of Oakland's Better Business Bureau, who said his agency
had received about 850 letters from irate customers.
</P>
<P>
   Providian says the number of complaints forwarded to it by the
bureau is less than the number the agency says it gets. ``It
appears customer dissatisfaction levels are being exaggerated,''
said Cole.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time she added, ``We are taking every question and
criticism into careful account.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer complaints about Providian run across the board, from
allegedly deceptive credit card solicitations to failure to
properly post payments.
</P>
<P>
   Anna Pena, a 29-year-old Fremont resident, said Providian sent
her a credit card even though she told a telemarketer she wasn't
interested. She sent the card back, but still received a bill with
monthly charges.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately the company dropped the charges. But Pena said it
denied her request to remove the account from her record with
credit bureaus. ``They refused to take it off,'' Pena said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Providian complaints concern the company's
requirement that some customers buy ``credit protection'' for
amounts up to $12.95 a month. Unlike most credit insurance
programs, which pay down outstanding balances if a borrower becomes
disabled or loses a job, Providian promises only to freeze the
account so that finance charges and fees no longer accrue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting complaints that they advertise they have no
annual fee, but that's like an annual fee,'' said Wallace. ``Their
disclosure is pathetic.''

SO FAR, DODGER BLUE NO BIG CREW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With almost a fourth of the baseball season concluded, it now is
official that the Los Angeles Dodgers just might rank as the most
underachieving team in the major leagues in light of their
monstrous $87 million payroll.
</P>
<P>
   Where is Fred Claire when we need him?
</P>
<P>
   I realize it might be slightly too early to make a definitive
assessment on these win-a-game, lose-a-game,
sleep-walk-through-a-game Dodgers, but you'd think Fox would be
getting far more value for its money than it has been receiving
from overpaid laborers who oftentimes seem lazier than a bunch of
firemen on a fishing trip to Cabo San Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   How can the San Francisco Giants, with their puny small-market
payroll that barely exceeds Kevin Brown's annual salary, be in
first place in the N.L. West Division even with their superstar
outfielder, Barry Bonds, long gone with a bum elbow?
</P>
<P>
   Why, even the Arizona Diamondbacks have been matching the
Dodgers, a most embarrassing phenomenon since the Diamondbacks have
been in existence a grand total of two years.
</P>
<P>
   The new Dodger general manager, Mr. Kevin Malone, predicted
before the season that this Dodger team had World Series destiny
embroidered all over its blue flannel uniforms, quite reassuring
rhetoric to patrons of a franchise that hasn't won a post-season
game since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   And, who knows, the Dodgers still might wind up in the Fall
Classic, if, by some wild stretch of the imagination, their
illustrious catcher, Todd Hundley, is able to throw out a base
runner or two between now and October.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers look to me like a hastily constructed team without
careful regard to chemistry in which there are some exceptional
individual parts like Kevin Brown and Gary Sheffield and Raul
Mondesi and some other parts that are best left unnamed so as not
to cause anyone lingering public embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   I don't pose as a baseball scientist, but I do know this much
about the game: you're never going to rival the '27 Yankees, or
even the '98 Yankees, or even the '97 Florida Marlins if you're not
strong up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Shhh, let's keep this a secret from Kevin Malone's employers,
who are going to have to pay more than $5 million this season in
revenue sharing for exceeding the salary cap, but the Dodgers have
two insufferably ordinary shortstops in Mark Grudzielanek and Jose
Vizcaino, an aging center fielder, Devon White, who might be too
prone to injury, and a catcher, Mr. Hundley, who can make Rosie
O'Donnell look swift on the base paths.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's quite early, the weather hasn't turned hot yet, and
the celebrated Dodger pitching staff figures to get stronger as the
season progresses.
</P>
<P>
   At least Chan Ho Park (3-3, 5.32 ERA) and Carlos Perez (1-4,
6.23 ERA) should improve on their shabby early season antics in
which they've given rousing impersonations of Anaheim Angel
pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   But at least Davey Johnson's counterpart down the Santa Ana
Freeway, Terry Collins, can offer a few legitimate excuses for his
Angels' lame beginning to a season of great promise.
</P>
<P>
   His team has been cursed by the usual spate of injuries starting
with the preseason departures of its shortstop, Gary DiSarcina, and
center fielder, Jim Edmonds, to the two-week absence of Mo Vaughn
to the recent sidelining of Tim Salmon.
</P>
<P>
   And no one expected the Angels to be a serious World Series
challenger, anyway, not with a pitching staff that, with the
possible exception of Chuck Finley, is comprised of a variety of
mediocrities either too old, too brittle and/or just too easy to
hit.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, I personally like Tim Belcher even though he once
threatened to tear out my heart I thought it was nicely
presumptuous on his part to perceive that I had one for my
questioning the strength of his heart. But the aging fellow now
possesses an ERA, 8.78, that looks as though it belongs on either
the Richter Scale or the Dow Jones Averages.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure anyone is shaking his noggin in frustration over
the plight of the Angels because no one ever expects anything but
disappointment from a team whose legacy is steeped in
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the erratic play of the Dodgers has caused
severe discomfort among their followers, not to mention among those
team executives like Kevin Malone and Bob (Don't Call Me Rocky)
Graziano who have raided Rupert Murdoch's bulging coffers to put
together this high-priced group.
</P>
<P>
   The expectations of the Dodgers, with their obscenely bloated
payroll, still are at a dizzying level, despite the modest
achievements of a team that eventually should pull away from its
competitors in the West because of its pitching staff that,
notwithstanding the feeble production of Messrs. Park and Perez,
still has the potential to be overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   But at the moment, these Dodgers don't give you the impression
of being destined for anything other than constant ridicule, which
they will inevitably endure if they continue to flounder.

 UNDATED: seem worthwhile.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dame Judi is splendid and great fun to watch as an actress who
is most actressy and out of touch in real life, whether dealing
with those she loves or even with a bankruptcy that might send a
more ordinary woman into a permanent nervous breakdown. Only at the
end of ``Amy's View,'' when she is about to go onstage in a hit
play that has arrived late in her career, is the essence of the
woman revealed. The scene is a stunner and is, I suspect, the
reason that people come away from ``Amy's View'' with such fond
feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Except for Esme, none of the characters in the play has the
startling authenticity of those recalled by Hare, acting David
Hare, in ``Via Dolorosa.'' Like so many characters in earlier Hare
plays, those in ``Amy's View'' tend to sound like mouthpieces. Yet
``Via Dolorosa'' is so good that it invites us to attend to all his
other work with greater care. It reveals the playwright to be a man
of piercing wit, understanding and intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amy's View'' has the manner of a play that has been
laboriously built and furnished, not out of creative urgency but
out of a need to provide temporary shelter for the author's
colleagues and himself.
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to see if the critical success of ``Via
Dolorosa'' has any effect on the direction Hare's work takes in the
future. Most encouraging is the fact that he is still taking
chances, still in the process of growing, still exploring new ways
of expression. He is alive and well and restless. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I hope New York audiences don't fail ``The Lonesome West,'' now
at the Lyceum Theater. If anything, this third play in Martin
McDonagh's Irish trilogy set in Leenane is more satisfying and less
tricky than the initial installment, ``The Beauty Queen of
Leenane,'' which closed not long ago, having won Tonys for three of
its actors and its director last season.
</P>
<P>
   That McDonagh is still a young playwright (he is 29) is apparent
in ``The Lonesome West,'' which replays the manners and, to a
certain extent, even the central situation of ``Beauty Queen.''
However, the denouement of ``The Lonesome West'' does not depend on
something as lame as an undelivered letter.
</P>
<P>
   The setting is another dreary Godforsaken farmhouse in County
Galway in the west of Ireland, inhabited this time by two aging
bachelors, Coleman Connor (Maeliosa Stafford), a brutish lout, and
his brother, Valene (Brian F. O'Byrne), a fussy fellow who collects
plaster figurines of saints as his passport to heaven. The two
deeply loathe each other but, at the start of the play, they have
become forever locked together.
</P>
<P>
   They have just buried their not so dear old dad, who died
suddenly when Coleman, in a rage, shot him at point-blank range. In
return for Valene's testimony that it was simply an unfortunate
household accident, Coleman has deeded his brother his share of
their father's money and is now dependent on the stingy Valene not
only for his freedom, but also for food, drink and the clothes on
his back.
</P>
<P>
   Surveying all, aware of everything, but himself unable to cope
with a parish where murder and other antisocial activities are
endemic, is Father Welsh (David Ganly). He is a young man who, in a
more shapely play, might have been its central figure. Welsh is not
a comic character. He is a sweet-natured fellow who has gone into
the church as a last resort. It's there, and it provides a living
in a land not bursting with opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Father Welsh hangs around Coleman and Valene because they are
free with their booze, and because he genuinely likes them. As the
rest of the parish goes about its dark business, the priest drinks
with Coleman and Valene and tries to save them from their mutual
hatred.
</P>

   The only thing that frightens the priest more than the Leenane
bloodshed is the adoring, openly available presence of Girleen
Kelleher (Dawn Bradfield). She is a pretty young thing who, knowing
Welsh's squeamishness about sex, can't resist talking dirty to him.
</P>
<P>
   Though most of ``The Lonesome West'' is devoted to the furious
sparring of Coleman and Valene, it is the ineffectual, alcoholic
Father Welsh, a nascent independent thinker, who dominates the
play. His gradual awakening to the hell he inhabits is the backbone
of ``The Lonesome West,'' providing a subtext for a work that
otherwise would be merely the Irish equivalent to the kind of
hillbilly cartoons Esquire used to run.
</P>
<P>
   Garry Hynes, who staged ``Beauty Queen,'' is also the director
of ``The Lonesome West,'' which is beautifully acted by Stafford,
O'Byrne, Ms. Bradfield and, particularly, Ganly. Still to come: the
second play in the Leenane Trilogy, ``A Skull in Connemara.''

   In one way and another, McDonagh is out to destroy the old
Hollywood vision that rural Ireland is a land of jolly, avuncular

STATE'S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FOR APRIL WAS LOWEST IN 33 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BILL VIRGIN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boeing keeps cutting, job growth in the Seattle area keeps
slowing, but the state still managed to post its lowest April
unemployment rate in 33 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Employment Security Department said Tuesday the jobless rate
was 4.4 percent in April, down from 5 percent in March and just
under the 4.5 percent reported for the state in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the unemployment rate (not seasonally adjusted) was
4 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
   That 4.4 percent rate came despite another month of heavy
cutting by The Boeing Co. In fact, the aircraft and parts category
showed the heaviest month-to-month drop _ 2,600 workers _ since
Boeing began cutting back its work force 10 months ago. Aircraft
employment is now down 11,100 jobs, or 10 percent from its peak,
the department said.
</P>
<P>
   That helped pull year-to-year job growth in the Seattle
metropolitan area (defined as King, Snohomish and Island counties)
to 2 percent, meaning that job growth for the state as a whole, at
2.6 percent, is actually higher; for many months the Seattle area
was growing faster. Higher-than-normal hiring in construction and
services is credited with the expansion of overall statewide
employment.
</P>
<P>
   But if job growth is slowing, why isn't the unemployment rate in
the Seattle area budging? For April the jobless rate was 3.1
percent, down from the 3.4 percent reported for March and about
even with the 3 percent reported a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors are at work. One is that the numbers are
preliminary and could be revised. Another is that the economy is,
in fact, still growing, and there's some trickle-down effect from
expansion in industries like aerospace and software. Unemployment
usually drops in spring and summer anyway, as seasonal businesses
open and start hiring.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor is that job growth and the unemployment rate
aren't directly connected. As Roberta Pauer, the department's
regional labor economist for the Seattle area, noted in a recent
analysis, the unemployment rate merely measures the number of
unemployed workers, divided by the size of the labor force _
including those who are employed as well as those seeking work. The
number of jobs in the area isn't directly a part of the
calculation.
</P>
<P>
   Both components of the unemployment rate are affected by people
moving into or out of the region, Pauer wrote. Because the economy
in the rest of the country is doing well, there are fewer people
being pushed to this area without jobs but looking for work. News
of Boeing cuts, meanwhile, reduces the pull of those coming to this
region without a job already lined up.
</P>
<P>
   From April 1998 to April 1999, the Seattle -area's labor force
grew at just 1.8 percent. From April 1997 to April 1998, the labor
force grew at 3.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a Puget Sound labor force growing much more modestly than
a few years ago as in-migration has subsided, our local
unemployment rate remains low despite our slowing economy,'' she
added.
</P>
<P>
   The unemployment rate for Tacoma and Pierce County was 4 percent
in April, down from 4.6 percent in March and 4.4 percent in April
1998. In Bremerton and Kitsap County, the jobless rate was 4.6
percent in April, 5.1 percent in March and 5 percent a year ago.

DOW LOSES MOMENTUM, FALLING 16.52 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices closed slightly lower Tuesday but well
above their lows of the session, as traders and investors reacted
with relative equanimity to the decision by the Federal Reserve
Board to adopt a more hawkish stance on interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Given the continued strength in the domestic economy and signs
that inflation may be on the rise, the announcement that the
Federal Open Market Committee had adopted a tightening bias toward
monetary policy did not shock financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Dow Jones industrial average, which had been up as
much as 77 points during the morning, sharply reversed course after
the Fed's announcement, tumbling as many as 112 points. But the
blue chip average subsequently regained much of that loss and
closed at 10,836.95, a drop of 16.52, or 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market got something that was not exactly a surprise, but
not friendly either, and it has taken the news and brushed it
aside,'' said Jonathan Olesky, head of block trading at Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past couple of weeks the market has had a lot of
bricks and rocks thrown at it, and it has been remarkably
resilient.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, much of the weakness in stock prices Tuesday was among
cyclical stocks, which over the last six weeks have posted very
strong gains. The Morgan Stanley Cyclical stock index, which hit a
record 619.09 May 10, fell 6.05 Tuesday, to 589.79, its sixth
straight decline.
</P>
<P>
   Oil stocks like Chevron, Exxon and Royal Dutch Petroleum moved
lower. So too did heavy equipment manufacturers like Caterpillar,
and big chemical companies like Dow Chemical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stocks like Dow have had a career move in a month or so,''
said Bob Bissell, president and chief investment officer of Wells
Capital Management. ``You have to expect them to correct some.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the Dow stocks, Chevron was the biggest decliner, falling 3
1/4, to 129 5/8. Exxon lost 1 1/4, to 77 3/4. And Royal Dutch
declined 1 1/4, to 55 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   Caterpillar, another Dow component, fell 2 3/16, to 58 3/4. And
Dow Chemical slumped 2 9/16, to 129 5/8.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Fed chose not to raise interest rates Tuesday,
concern that it might soon do just that could keep a lid on stock
prices. Such a development would probably sit well with the Fed,
according to some analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the Fed in any way, shape or form is trying to
knock down stock prices,'' said Donald Fine, chief market analyst
at Chase Asset Management.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I am sure they would like to see stocks plateau. Over the
last year or so the wealth effect from a rising stock market has
contributed to a sharp increase in consumer spending,'' he added.
``If the stock market plateaus for a while, that should slow
consumer spending down.''
</P>
<P>
   Fine said that despite the spike in consumer prices during
April, the threat of a sustained rise in the rate of inflation _ a
major concern for the Fed _ seems low.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inflation is not nearly the threat the consumer price index
suggested,'' he said. ``Inflation will be noticeably higher this
year than it was in 1998, at around 2 percent to 2.25 percent. But
there is no real reason to expect a sustained pickup.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, in the bond market, which abhors inflation,
Treasury securities erased earlier gains and fell after the Fed
announced it was adopting a tightening bias. But an afternoon round
of buying pared the losses. The price of the benchmark 30-year
Treasury bond actually gained 2/32 from late Monday to 91 5/32,
pushing its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, down to
5.88 percent from 5.89 percent late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Prices of short- and intermediate Treasury securities were
generally lower.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the stock market, declines in oil stocks and
regional telephone companies helped push the Standard &AMP; Poors 500
index down 6.17, or 0.5 percent, to 1,333.32. The NASDAQ composite
index fell 3.48, or 0.1 percent, to 2,558.36. But the Russell 2000
index of small company stocks rose 1.10, or 0.25 percent, to
442.45.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard, which reported strong earnings after the market
closed on Monday, was the biggest gainer among Dow stocks, rising 9
3/16 Tuesday, to 96.
</P>
<P>
   Dell Computer, which rose 13/16 to 44 1/16 in Tuesday's trading,
is likely to come under selling pressure in Wednesday's session,
because after the market closed, Dell, the leading direct seller of
personal computers, posted first-quarter results that just met Wall
Street's forecasts but, nevertheless, disappointed some investors.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, J.C. Penney, the nation's second-largest department
store company, rose 4 7/8 to 50 1/8 after it announced it would
offer 20 percent of its Eckerd drugstores to the public and sell
its credit card portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   And Kmart, another big retailer, rose 13/16 to 17 3/16 after
announcing it would buy back as much as $1 billion of its
outstanding common stock.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After years of battling with President Clinton,
House Republicans are shifting their sights to Vice President Al
Gore, and using ridicule as their weapon of choice.
</P>
<P>
   The office of House Majority Leader Dick Armey has become an
unofficial clearinghouse of anti-Gore press releases and activity,
with Armey mocking Gore over his pronouncements on air travel, the
Internet and traffic congestion.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, House conservatives plan to enter the fray. Four or
five members of the ``Conservative Action Team'' are to go to the
House floor after the day's business and, with television cameras
running, give readings of what they consider to be the most
provocative, or perhaps most inscrutable, sections of ``Earth in
the Balance,'' Gore's 1992 book on the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The readings will come after another slap at Gore. A bill
authorizing programs for NASA scheduled to be voted on by the House
on Wednesday has been stripped of money for the Triana project,
Gore's proposal to have a live video image of the Earth spinning in
black space transmitted 24 hours a day on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have shifted the $32 million into medical
research. ``If we're just going to put satellites up and look at
Earth, that's silly,'' said Rep. George Nethercutt, R-Wash. ``It
just happens to be a bad project dreamed up by Mr. Gore. It doesn't
matter to me who came up with the nutty idea; it's a nutty idea
that should go.''
</P>
<P>
   Armey, trying hard to stay deadpan, Tuesday distributed to
reporters a list of Web sites that already carry pictures of the
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The focus on Gore, the leading candidate for the Democratic
presidential nomination, is a sign of how presidential politics is
seeping into Congress a full year and a half before the election.
This is traditionally the time when partisan passions are running
less strongly and serious legislation has more of a chance. But
Congress has moved directly from the bitterness of impeachment to
the passions of the 2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lehane, a spokesman for Gore, said Tuesday that
Republicans are going after the vice president because they
``recognize this guy is an extremely strong candidate and they want
to derail a compelling story.'' And he accused the House
Republicans of lacking an agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have no message of their own that's an affirmative
message or a positive message,'' he said. ``If they spent one-tenth
of the effort they spend attacking us on doing some positive things
you might actually see some positive legislation coming out of the
Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Republicans complain that President Clinton is
devoting himself to the election of Gore and a Democratic-led House
instead of seeking common cause with Republicans on issues like
Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   For years Congress ran multiple investigations of Clinton. But
with Gore, Republicans are betting that well-timed ridicule can be
more devastating than any inquiry. In essence, they are trying to
do to him what Democrats tried to do to former Vice President Dan
Quayle: make him the foil for comedians on late-night television.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Republican side, we are more sensitive to this, having
watched what happened to Quayle,'' said Rep. David McIntosh,
R-Ind., a former Quayle aide who is one of the organizers of the
readings from Gore's book. ``You can't make somebody funny when
they are not providing the material,'' he said, adding that Gore
``provides a lot of it.''
</P>
<P>
   So when Gore, for example, proposed a federal traffic hot line,
Armey said, ``Next we'll have traffic reports from Air Force Two
and a sports ticker on the White House lawn. Why should anyone have
to call Washington to get their local bus schedule?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's assertion recently that he had been instrumental in the
creating the Internet provoked jokes not only from Armey and Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott but also from the House Science
Committee. ``Delusions of Grandeur: Vice President Gore Takes
Credit for Creating the Internet,'' said a statement from the
committee.
</P>
<P>
   And when Rep. John Doolittle, R-Calif., took to the House floor
just before Earth Day, he gave a preview of what the conservatives
would sound like Wednesday. He read from Gore's book an assertion
that the century's two world wars, the Holocaust, nuclear weapons
and ``global environmental crisis have led many of us to wonder if
survival, much less, enlightened, joyous and hopeful living, is
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Doolittle asked, ``Does any reasonable person really sit here
and wonder if survival is even possible? I mean, this is
unimaginable.''
</P>
<P>
   If anyone in Congress runs short of lines, the Republican
National Committee puts out a regular fax and e-mail feature called
``The World According to Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehane was dismissive of the mockery. ``We can stand after six
and a half years and say we have a stronger economy and cleaner
environment and that absolutely terrifies the Republicans,'' he
said. Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster, described the
Republican efforts as ``a distraction for Gore'' but said, ``This
is petty politics as opposed to grand politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the disputes do involve policy. Gore has put particular
emphasis on his environmental record and is now pushing for
preservation of open space, a reduction of traffic congestion and
easier commutes.
</P>
<P>
   The House Republicans came into office determined to roll back
regulation, much of it related to the environment. Many of them see
Gore's new initiatives on sprawl as an infringement on property
rights. Armey's aides are preparing a memorandum for House
Republicans to take with them over the Memorial Day recess telling
them how to talk about Gore's anti-sprawl initiatives. They might
say, for example, that people might have to ride a bus to work
instead of a car.

MARKET PLACE: HIGHER RATES MAY NOT HURT FOREIGN RECOVERIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A jump in interest rates in the United States _ which the
Federal Reserve indicated Tuesday was likely _ would raise the
risks for the world's emerging markets just as they begin to
recover from a financial crisis that began almost two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prospects for recovery in many of these countries are now
going to be called into question,'' said Jose Barrionuevo, director
of global market strategy at Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Tuesday's announcement by the Fed, which said it now
leans toward increasing rates to curb inflationary pressures, could
prove to be more of a long-term benefit for these markets than the
first headlines might suggest.
</P>
<P>
   ``If interest rates stay around here, it is not going to be
devastating for emerging markets,'' said Jose Luis Daza, managing
director for emerging markets at J.P. Morgan Securities. If rates
rise much higher, though, emerging markets could suffer troublesome
declines in exports and higher borrowing costs.
</P>
<P>
   One positive sign Tuesday was that both U.S. and emerging
markets took the Fed announcement in stride. The Dow Jones
industrial average initially plunged almost 150 points on the news
but largely recovered, finishing the day off 16.52 points at
10,836.95. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond slipped slightly
while the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to
5.89 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In Brazil, meanwhile, the Bovespa stock index initially fell but
rebounded to finish up 1 percent on the day.
</P>
<P>
   Investors hope the Fed's new bias toward higher rates may be the
kind of pre-emptive strike that calms fears about inflation, a fear
stoked Friday with the news that the Consumer Price Index jumped
0.7 percent in April. If so, rates may not rise much more.
</P>
<P>
   An interest rate increase soon could also help guide the U.S.
economy to the ``soft landing'' that Fed officials would like. A
soft landing means a slowing of growth here. But it avoids a sharp
decline, or even a recession, which would be much more damaging for
emerging-market countries, many of which depend on Americans to buy
their exports.
</P>
<P>
   And even if the Fed does raise its short-term interest rate
target, economists are not expecting a big move, such as the one
that occurred when rates rose three full percentage points in just
a year starting in February 1994. The forecast among many
economists and market strategists calls for a total rise of
three-quarters of a percentage point in the Federal funds rate
between this summer and the first half of next year.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of move, said Jay Pelosky, the global emerging markets
strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, ``is not a sufficient
condition for derailing the new investment cycle in the emerging
markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelosky also argued that the Fed move is ``good for emerging
markets because it will provide a pause or pullback for markets
that have risen rapidly.'' Since October, the Morgan Stanley
Capital International index of emerging markets has jumped more
than 60 percent in dollar terms.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate reaction to big news often deceives investors
about the trend for the longer term. But the emerging financial
markets that were open Tuesday when the Fed made its announcement
did not panic _ signaling that investors had already anticipated
the move, as shown by the surges recently in interest rates in the
United States and in emerging markets. It may also mean that
investors are not that concerned about the consequences of any
future Fed move.
</P>
<P>
   The spreads between interest rates offered by emerging-market
nations and those for Treasuries rose modestly Tuesday. But the
move came early in the day and did not widen after the Fed
announcement, according to indexes kept by J.P. Morgan Securities.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed also seemed to express confidence in the outlook for
emerging markets. Past comments by Fed policy-makers suggest that
they would not have taken this step if they thought it would
undermine global financial markets. The economic data on Brazil _
which shrank just 1 percent in the first quarter from a year ago _
and on Mexico _ which grew 1.9 percent _ have been pleasant
surprises.
</P>
<P>
   While a modest move by the Fed would not devastate emerging
markets, it would still curb their recoveries. Barrionuevo at
Lehman Brothers noted that Mexico, which sends 80 percent of its
exports to the United States, would be hurt if U.S. demand slowed.
</P>
<P>
   And even moderately higher interest rates _ a move, say, to more
than 6 percent for long-term rates _ would make it harder for
nations like Argentina and Venezuela to borrow. Venezuela is now
weighing a major global bond issue.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of uncertainty remains. Until it is clear how serious any
inflation threat in the United States actually is, speculation
about when the Fed will raise rates and by how much will keep
emerging markets volatile.
</P>
<P>
   Desmond Lachman, director of emerging-markets research for
Salomon Smith Barney, summed up the outlook this way. Referring to
the Fed's new bias toward higher rates, he said, ``Clearly, it is
not good news for emerging markets.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``we are not expecting the Brazil rebound to be
derailed.''

   FED LEAVES RATES ALONE BUT HINTS AT INCREASE LATER
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve left interest rates steady but put investors
and consumers on notice that it might raise them in coming months
if it continued to see signs of increasing inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The shift in stance by the central bank's policy-making
committee _ from neutral to leaning toward higher rates _ was
subtle but signaled a clear change in the Fed's outlook from last
fall, when it cut rates three times in response to the global
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's announcement sent stock and bond prices tumbling, but
they recovered much of their losses. The Dow industrial average
fell 16.52 points, to 10,836.95. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index fell 6.17 points, to 1,333.32, and the NASDAQ composite index
declined 3.48 points, to 2,558.36.

<P>
   LOEHMANN'S FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY
</P>
<P>
   Loehmann's, the Bronx-based retailer that offers designer
apparel at bargain prices, filed for bankruptcy protection. The
company said the filing would not have an effect on the day-to-day
operations of its 69 stores. A company spokesman, however, said it
was too early to say what will happen to either the stores or
Loehmann's 2,500 employees.

organizations _ a seeming reversal of the last two decades'
emphasis on individual personal computers.

SENATE PASSES AMENDMENT REQUIRING SAFETY LOCKS AS GOP DEBATES GUN
MEASURES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate on Tuesday revived consideration of a
juvenile crime bill by passing an amendment that would require
trigger locks or ``safe storage devices'' to be sold with all
handguns.
</P>
<P>
   The vote of 78-20 illustrated just how sensitive Republicans
have become to criticism in the aftermath of the Littleton, Colo.,
school violence that they are in the pocket of the National Rifle
Association, which has been opposed to most gun-control measures.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-four Republicans joined with 44 Democrats to pass the
bill. The 20 who voted against it were Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans had sought to block the amendment, sponsored by
Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., and other Democrat-sponsored gun control
measures because of opposition from the NRA.
</P>
<P>
   But a public backlash to a Republican vote in the Senate last
week against requiring background checks on buyers at gun shows _
action that was later reversed _ forced some GOP lawmakers to
reconsider their opposition to Kohl's measure, which requires that
safety locks and devices be sold with the weapons and leaves the
decision on whether to use them with the gun owners.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl's measure is aimed at reducing access to handguns by
children and especially teen-agers, who are responsible for
committing an estimated 7,000 violent crimes each year using guns
taken from their own homes.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks before the vote, Kohl observed that the recent
incident at Columbine High School in Littleton had forced both
Republicans and Democrats to get more serious about gun-control
measures as one way to help curb youth violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is that, in the wake of Littleton, both sides have
grown up a bit: Democrats in acknowledging that culture may have
something to do with juvenile violence today; and Republicans in
finally endorsing reasonable measures to take handguns out of the
hands of kids who shouldn't have them,'' Kohl said.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment passed as part of a larger bill aimed at
strengthening laws dealing with juvenile crime. The senators also
approved measures providing for tougher penalties for gang members
who commit crimes and young offenders who wear body armor.
</P>
<P>
   The juvenile crime bill, nearly two years in the making, was in
danger of being pulled from the floor Tuesday because of Democratic
objections to Republican efforts aimed at limiting the number of
amendments that could be offered. The Democrats accused the GOP
leadership of trying to prevent them from attaching even modest gun
control measures to the legislation, although Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott insisted that he wanted only to get ``the bill
done'' by expediting the debate.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats insisted that Lott, R-Miss., was trying to end
debate on a bill that had already caused the GOP considerable
embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority leader wants this bill to fade away without a
roar or a whimper and without any Republican blame,'' said Sen.
Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy was referring to an incident last week in which the
Republican majority voted to kill a Democratic bill requiring
background checks for buyers at gun shows. The Republicans later
reversed themselves by passing a weaker version of the bill that
critics say will allow criminals to skirt the checks.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats are now trying to force additional votes on the
background check measure in order to close new loopholes that they
insist have been written into the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican reversal, however, has caused an uproar within
the party over gun-control issues. Republicans are struggling to
find a middle ground where they can appear to be tougher on gun
control without alienating the NRA and other key constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of that struggle was apparent Tuesday in the House,
where Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., suggested in an interview
with The Associated Press that lawmakers should consider raising
the age for legal possession of handguns from 18 to 21. He also
came out strongly in favor of requiring background checks for all
sales at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there needs to be uniformity in what they do at gun
shows and what they do in a retail business,'' Hastert said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just saying 21 is basically a standard of adulthood, and
there's probably a uniformity that fits there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The comments were striking coming in the wake of the Senate vote
on gun shows last week and given the fact that he has opposed
gun-control legislation in the past. His remarks also highlighted
how Republicans are trying to carve out a more moderate position on
gun-control measures in the aftermath of the public outrage over
the Columbine shooting and bombing incident in which 12 students
and a teacher were killed by two students who also took their own
lives.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released by the White House, President Clinton
commended Hastert ``for agreeing that we should close the gun show
loophole and raise the age of handgun ownership from 18 to 21.''
</P>
<P>
   The president, who will travel Thursday to Littleton, called on
the Senate to ``put progress over politics and give its strong
backing to these reasonable measures to keep guns out of the hands
of children and criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also called the support for Kohl's bill ``a courageous,
common sense vote that will help prevent tragic shootings and
gun-related accidents in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, who voted against both the 1993 Brady law that
initiated a three-day waiting period for handgun buyers and created
an instant background check and 1994 legislation banning assault
weapons, said he expects a vote later this year in the House on new
gun control legislation as part of efforts to stiffen juvenile
crime penalties
</P>
<P>
   But House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, suggested Tuesday
that any juvenile justice legislation that has a strong gun control
component may face tough opposition from the Republican
rank-and-file in the House, regardless of what position the leaders
take.
</P>
<P>
   He said in order to win approval by the House, the bill will
have to focus more on enforcing current gun laws and dealing with
cultural problems that lead to violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody I've discussed this with is looking beyond this
singular set of (gun control) issues,'' he told reporters.

MEXICO INTERIOR MINISTER RESIGNS TO RUN IN NOVEMBER PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ A day after the governing party voted to pick its
presidential candidate in a primary election, the man who is widely
believed to be President Ernesto Zedillo's preferred choice
announced Tuesday that he would resign his post to run for the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate, Interior Minister Francisco Labastida Ochoa, has
been the first among equals in the president's cabinet, with
oversight over all domestic political affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Under the longstanding system in which presidents have
``tapped'' their successors, five successive presidents who held
office from the 1940s through the '70s selected their interior
ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida said he would hand in his resignation to Zedillo on
Thursday, when he returns from a trip to California. Zedillo did
not announce who would succeed Labastida as interior minister.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by Labastida, who is 42, was not unexpected.
Although Zedillo has endorsed no candidate, numerous political
commentators have for three months been seeing signs in the often
murky political tea leaves that Labastida is ``el bueno,'' the good
one _ the term for the president's candidate.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Labastida's supporters have turned his trips
outside Mexico City, ostensibly on Interior Ministry business, into
virtual campaign appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida's announcement was greeted by one of the usual signs
that a candidate has the backing of the party establishment _
statements of support from the Labor Congress, one of the
party-controlled labor federations.
</P>
<P>
   The early campaign period has traditionally been a delicate
moment, when the Institutional Revolutionary Party candidates, who
have won 11 elections in a row, begin distancing themselves from
the incumbents while seeking to retain their favor and backing.
</P>
<P>
   In making his announcement in a hotel convention room packed
with hundreds of cheering supporters, Labastida said, ``I will
always recognize in Ernesto Zedillo his patriotism, his honesty,
his great dedication to the service of the best causes of our
country.''
</P>
<P>
   As party leaders drafted nominating rules, they faced frequent
criticism from two of Labastida's rivals, former Gov. Manuel
Bartlett Diaz of Puebla and Gov. Roberto Madrazo Pintado of
Tabasco, both of whom have been actively campaigning since Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The two have repeatedly voiced suspicions that new nominating
rules might be rigged to favor the president's candidate, arousing
speculation that either politician might eventually wound the party
by leaving its ranks. Bartlett calmed those fears Tuesday, praising
the rules as a triumph of longtime efforts to strengthen democracy
in the party, although he warned that irregularities could occur in
the primary, scheduled for Nov. 7, if the rules are not fairly
applied.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are good rules,'' Bartlett said. ``I'll stay in this
nominating process until the end. I'm going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo remained silent on his plans. And so did another
potential contender, Gov. Miguel Aleman Velasco of Veracruz, who
has pledged to clarify weeks of ambiguity about his intentions.
Aleman is the son of the former president who presided over the
postwar boom years, and polls show that his legendary name would
make him a formidable candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Aleman encouraged Veracruzanos to call his office to
advise him whether to run. On Monday, he said that most callers
were urging him to stay in Veracruz, and Mexican commentators have
interpreted other recent events, too, as signs that he will not
run.

<P>
   Whatever lessons the war with Serbia may teach NATO's military
planners, American weapons makers are already anticipating that
Kosovo may help secure a strategic victory for them _ not on the
battlefield, but in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   After a decade of slashing armaments spending by nearly 70
percent and downsizing the military contracting industry,
Washington now seems inclined to increase outlays for weapons. And
this spending will go far beyond the request for $12.2 billion in
Kosovo emergency funds now before Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Even before NATO bombs started dropping, the administration's
budget proposal in February had requested $112 billion in
additional Pentagon spending over the next five years to bring the
Pentagon's budget up to $319 billion by 2005. The increase,
intended in part to head off Republican claims that the Democratic
White House has let the military atrophy, would be the biggest
increase in military spending since the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   For military contractors, the relevant portion of the Pentagon
budget is the money earmarked for weapons _ as much as $53 billion
for weapons procurement next year and $60 billion the following
year _ compared with $44 billion last year, which was the lowest
level in more than a decade. Although there was already widespread
support for the spending measures, many political and industry
analysts say that the fighting in Kosovo can only strengthen the
case for increasing weapons spending when Congress takes up the
Pentagon budget early this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosovo has definitely changed things here on defense spending
issues,'' said Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., who heads the
procurement subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee, the
subcommittee that helps set the level of weapons spending. ``Folks
who used to vote to cut defense massively are now voting to deploy
our military more and more.''
</P>
<P>
   The spending increases would be used to replenish stocks of
ships and aircraft, radar jammers and missiles that the Pentagon,
for years, claimed have become dangerously frayed and dangerously
low. Just how many, and what kinds of weapons would be the topic of
much further debate and lobbying, even once the money was
appropriated.
</P>
<P>
   But this much is already clear: Most of the transports, weapons
and ordnance now in use in Kosovo is equipment no longer actively
produced _ including the C-5 transport plane, the B-2 bomber and
the Tomahawk cruise missile. So the need for new generations of
materiel, and the money to pay for it, represents the best business
opportunity in years for military contractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosovo underscores what the industry has been saying _ that we
need to get to a sustainable rate of spending,'' said Daniel T.
Burnham, chief executive of the Raytheon Co., which made the
Tomahawk cruise missile. ``We need to get to $60 billion in weapons
outlays,'' Burhham said. ``We are now on that path. And we are
getting there faster than we first thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Too fast, perhaps, for some.
</P>
<P>
   ``The procurement amounts proposed are out of line,'' Rep. Neil
Abercrombie, D-Hawaii, and ranking member of a House Armed Services
personnel subcommittee, said on Tuesday. ``We haven't answered
fundamental questions of what size defense we want, how we get
there and what are the costs the country can realistically absorb
in a post Cold War environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The downsizing and consolidation that followed the end of the
Cold War has left the nation with three main military contractors:
the Boeing Co., Raytheon and the Lockheed Martin Co., along with
thousands and thousands of subcontractors that are attached to
these giants.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon budgets have long been operated on a boom-and-bust
cycle. But during this latest period of industry reorganization,
fundamental changes were also taking place in the nature of
warfare. No longer was the nation planning for a big two-country
conflict of the type once feared with the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the 1990s have been characterized by many small
military engagements. Compared with the Bush administration, when
there were 14 military engagements _ most notably the Gulf War _
the Clinton years so far have seen American troops called into
action nearly four dozen times, including the current engagement in
Yugoslavia. Those efforts include military missions in South Korea,
Haiti, Somalia, the Balkans and Iraq _ as well as humanitarian
efforts following hurricanes and earthquakes in Central America and
other places.
</P>
<P>
   ``These engagements wear out equipment faster, and the faster it
wears out, the sooner you have to pay for new equipment,'' said
Jonathan L. Etherton, head of legislative affairs for the Aerospace
Industries Association, a Washington trade group. ``A lot of this
equipment will end its useful life faster than expected.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, in addition to the C-5 and B-2 planes and
Tomahawk cruise missiles, many of other weapons now being used in
the Balkans have aged and, often, are no longer in production. The
Pentagon has not bought new F-16 Fighting Falcons in years, and the
F-15 Strike Eagle production line is about to close. The list of
aircraft out of production includes the EA-6B, a Navy anti-jamming
aircraft; the A-10 Thunderbolt, the A-6 attack air-to-ground craft
and the F-117 Stealth fighter.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While the next generation of weapons is still largely a matter
for Congress and the Pentagon to decide _ with intense lobbying
from military contractors _ the Pentagon has already drawn up a
wish list. It includes additional F-22's, upgrades of the Abrams
tanks and Apache helicopter, a new destroyer, attack submarine and
a new aircraft carrier.
</P>
<P>
   And in what already is shaping up as a showdown between Boeing
and Lockheed Martin, the Pentagon has proposed a Joint Strike
Fighter to replace the F-16, now made by Lockheed.
</P>
<P>
   One other impact of Kosovo for American military contractors is
the realization that NATO might not be as much of a customer for
their future products as previously imagined. For years, the
military industry has lobbied for NATO expansion _ in fact the
Committee to Expand NATO, the main lobbying force, is headed by a
Lockheed Martin executive. The assumption has been that all these
countries would want to buy all the latest and newest equipment
that American arms makers could produce rather than relying on
European-made armaments.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Kosovo has highlighted the shortcomings of many of
the European forces _ and thus of coalition warfare, when allies
are not equally equipped. Only 10 percent of the aircraft used by
European forces are capable of precision bombing, and few of the
NATO countries have the smart weapons and communications systems
now common in the American military. But it is unclear whether
other NATO nations will increase their military budgets enough to
buy new equipment and, even if they did, whether they would buy
from American military contractors rather then European ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosovo is showing the big disparities in NATO capability,''
said one military industry lobbyist, who insisted on not being
named. ``That will be looked at after the war. But will these
countries have the political imperative to buy this new equipment?
The answer is still out.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By a lopsided vote of 78-20, the Senate on Tuesday
approved a measure that would require that child safety devices be
included with each of the millions of handguns sold by licensed
dealers in the United States every year.
</P>
<P>
   Only last July, the Senate defeated a similar proposal by a vote
of 61-39. The starkly different outcome this time around was the
latest illustration of federal lawmakers' keener appetite for gun
control after the school shooting in Littleton, Colo., in April.
</P>
<P>
   Another example of that change came in the announcement Tuesday
that House Speaker Dennis Hastert supported several of the new gun
control measures under consideration by the Senate. The House has
yet to consider gun control legislation this year.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert spokesman John Feehery said Tuesday that the speaker
personally favored mandatory background checks on all buyers at gun
shows, which is a provision in a measure the Senate passed last
week. Feehery said Hastert also supported an increase in the
minimum age for legal possession of a handgun to 21 from 18, a
provision in a proposal the Senate will probably consider this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Feehery stressed that Hastert's opinions were personal and that
the speaker would take the temperature of other Republicans in the
House before promoting any particular legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert had not articulated his feelings about those specific
issues previously, but he had voted in the past against several
successful pieces of gun control legislation, like mandatory
waiting periods for handgun purchases and a ban on many types of
assault weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In yet another sign of movement by Republicans in Congress,
House Majority Leader Dick Armey said Tuesday that gun control
measures might be allowed to reach the floor of the House in
connection with a juvenile crime bill still in the House Judiciary
Committee. House Republicans had previously said that such measures
were inappropriate additions to the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The measure on child safety devices that passed the Senate on
Tuesday was an amendment to a broader juvenile crime bill with an
uncertain fate. Republicans and Democrats were still struggling
Tuesday night to reach some agreement on how much more time the
Senate would devote to the bill and how many more amendments
Republicans and Democrats would be permitted to offer.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott reiterated Tuesday that he
would put the bill on the shelf for the time being if it could not
be brought to a final vote soon, but instead of setting a firm
deadline, Lott merely talked about getting the bill to a final vote
this week.
</P>
<P>
   The bill has become the vehicle for several gun control
amendments, of which the one requiring the sale of child safety
devices was only the latest. Both Republicans and Democrats
attributed the success of that measure, whose principal sponsor was
Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., to changes in the political climate
surrounding gun control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it shows unquestionably that the horror of what took
place in Littleton, Colo., has had its effect,'' said Sen. John
Chafee, R-R.I., a co-sponsor of Kohl's amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Chafee was one of only three Republicans who supported a version
of the amendment last July. Fifty-two Republicans opposed it then,
as did nine Democrats. Thirty-six Democrats supported it.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's vote, 34 Republicans and 44 Democrats voted in
favor of the amendment. Twenty Republicans opposed it. One
Republican and one Democrat were absent.
</P>
<P>
   Senators who switched their positions between then and now gave
a variety of reasons, from subtle differences in the two versions
of the measure to a heightened concern, bred by the bloodshed at
several schools in recent years, over children's access to guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel it's the right thing to do,'' said Sen. Gordon
Smith, R- Ore., who voted for child safety devices Tuesday but
against them last year.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said that the series of school shootings that culminated
with Littleton ``have a lot of us looking for ways to promote
safety.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to understand what helps, what makes a
difference,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans who voted against child safety devices again this
time said the mandatory measure was unnecessary, because such
devices were already available in all gun shops.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody wants them, they can buy them,'' said Senator Don
Nickles of Oklahoma, the majority whip. ``They're out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Those Republicans who supported the amendment got clear
permission from party leaders. Lott voted for it, and the
Republican managing the debate on the juvenile crime bill, Sen.
Orrin Hatch of Utah, signed onto the amendment as a co-sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl's measure applies only to licensed gun dealers, as opposed
to casual sellers, and requires that they include something like a
secure storage container or trigger lock with the sale of every
handgun. According to Handgun Control Inc., a gun control advocacy
group, licensed dealers sell about 2 million handguns annually.
</P>
<P>
   The principal changes in the measure between last year and this
one were minor. In a concession to Republicans, the amendment that
passed Tuesday would grant qualified protection from liability for
owners whose handguns end up causing damage despite the proper use
of a safety device.
</P>
<P>
   This year's version leaves the kind of safety device with a
handgun to a dealer's discretion; last year's required that the
device meet the handgun manufacturer's approval. Wayne La Pierre,
executive vice president of the National Rifle Association, said
today that the organization did not oppose the amendment.

JUDGES REINSTATE CHARGES OVER CAMPAIGN DONATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a victory for the Justice Department's campaign
finance investigation, a federal appeals court panel on Tuesday
reinstated five criminal charges against a Democratic fund-raiser
that had been thrown out by a district court judge.
</P>
<P>
   A unanimous three-judge panel of the United States Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that a Federal
District Court judge erred in September 1998 when he dismissed five
of six campaign-related charges against the fund-raiser, Maria
Hsia. The five charges accused her of causing false statements to
be filed in reports to federal election officials.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court ruled that Judge Paul L. Friedman was wrong in
relying on the First Amendment's broad protections of religious
expression and free speech in dismissing the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see no constitutional difficulty in use of the statutes
against the conduct alleged here,'' wrote Judge Stephen F. Williams
in Tuesday's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also ruled that Friedman had incorrectly required
prosecutors to show that Ms. Hsia knew she was breaking the law.
The appeals court ruled that prosecutors merely had to show that
she knew her statements were false when she misidentified donors to
election officials.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who was appointed to the federal appellate bench by
President Ronald Reagan in the 1980's, was joined in the ruling by
Judges Judith W. Rogers and David S. Tatel, who were appointed by
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Although the ruling applies only to Ms. Hsia, it appears highly
likely that it will lead to the reinstatement of similar charges
against two other Democratic fund-raisers, Yah Lin Trie, a longtime
friend of President Clinton, and Pauline Kanchanalak, a Thai
businesswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's spokesman, Myron Marlin, said that
prosecutors were pleased by the decision. ``This means we can press
ahead on these charges not only in this case but in other cases,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hsia's lawyer, Nancy Luque, said that she would appeal the
ruling to the full Circuit Court or the Supreme Court. ``I'm
disappointed that the Court of Appeals did not see the wisdom of
Judge Friedman's analysis premised as it was on important First
Amendment freedoms,'' Ms. Luque said.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling could provide a lift to the Justice Department, which
has brought only a few major cases after nearly three years of
investigation into Democratic campaign finance abuses in 1996.
Republicans in Congress have criticized the department's handling
of the inquiry, focusing on Attorney General Janet Reno's refusal
to allow an outside prosecutor to investigate any aspect of the
campaign finance issue.
</P>
<P>
   Until Tuesday, it appeared that Friedman's rulings in campaign
finance cases would seriously undercut the Justice Department's
efforts. In one ruling he described the government's efforts as an
``Alice in Wonderland'' interpretation of the law to allow
prosecutors to charge Ms. Hsia with a felony instead of a
misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman's rulings symbolized the dilemma confronting
prosecutors in trying to bring criminal cases using election laws
that the judge said had been intentionally engineered by Congress
to be weak and permit exactly the kind of fund-raising excesses at
the heart of the campaign finance case.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday's ruling recast the atmosphere surrounding the Hsia,
Trie and Kanchanalak cases, validating the legal theories behind
the government's indictments and reviving the prospect that Ms.
Hsia, along with Trie and Ms. Kanchanalak, would be tried for the
crime of causing campaign committees to file false statements to
the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In Ms. Hsia's case, the reinstated charges center directly on
her fund-raising activities. They accuse her of disguising
contributions to the Clinton-Gore campaign and other Federal
candidates between 1993 and 1996 by providing election officials
with the names of contributors who were not the true source of
donations.
</P>
<P>
   The straw donors actually concealed legally questionable
contributors like the International Buddhist Progress Society,
which operates the Hsi Lai Temple in California. The temple was the
host of an April 1996 fund-raiser attended by Vice President Al
Gore, who was named as an unindicted co-conspirator when Ms. Hsia
was indicted last year.
</P>
<P>
   The one charge among the original six that had stood against Ms.
Hsia was for conspiracy involving $65,000 in illegal contributions
by the temple.

   ``A previously unreleased song, believed to be the last record
featuring all four Beatles, will be out in late summer. The
three-minute, still-untitled song was recorded _ then supposedly
lost _ at the Abbey Road Studios during the 1968 sessions for the
Yellow Submarine album. It features John Lennon on lead vocal.
</P>
<P>
   ``No new work has been done on it,'' an unidentified source told

   _A previously unreleased song, believed to be the last recording
made by the band America, will be out in late summer.
</P>
<P>
   The two-minute, still-untitled song was recorded _ then
supposedly lost _ in 1983 during a recording session. It features
Dewey Bunell on lead vocals; he is interrupted by bandmates Dan
Peek and Gerry Beckley. Peek shouts, ``Enough already! This is too
wimpy, even for us.'' Beckley adds, ``I'm fallin' asleep here. We

</P>
<P>
   The three-minute, still untitled artifact was recorded _ then
supposedly lost _ at a Florida recording studio during the sessions
for 1982's ``All in a Night's Work.''It features bassist Richard
Finch frantically telling the 911 operator that his cat has been
killed in a grisly blender accident; bandleader Harry Wayne Casey
is then heard shouting over the laughter of the other band members
that it's ``just a joke, Richard _ that's homemade salsa.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No new work has been done on it,'' an unidentified source
said, ``but Harry has said this will be the last Sunshine Band
recording. There's nothing else left.''
</P>
<P>
   _A previously unreleased recording of John ``Bonzo'' Bonham
accidentally setting fire to his own hair, believed to be the last
recording made by Led Zeppelin, will be out in late summer.
</P>
<P>
   The 29-minute, still-untitled prank was recorded _ then
supposedly lost _ after a tape machine was left running during
recording of 1979's ``In Through the Out Door.'' It features
Bonham, after several dares by bandmates, dousing his head with
gasoline, then waving a lighter nearby. ``Holy (expletive),'' a
voice _ perhaps that of singer Robert Plant _ is heard saying. ``He
really did it!
</P>
<P>
   ``No new work has been done on it,'' an unidentified source
said, ``but Robert and Jimmy (Page) have said this will be the last
Led Zeppelin release. There's nothing else left.''

HOUSE APPROVES BILL BANNING MOST SUITS AGAINST GUNMAKERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JULIE MASON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The House on Tuesday gave final approval to a
bill banning most governmental lawsuits against gunmakers, and
defeated an amendment calling for criminal background checks at gun
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Bill 717 by Sen. Jon Lindsay, R-Houston, would prevent
cities, counties and other entities from suing manufacturers and
sellers of firearms and ammunition for the public costs associated
with gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   Already passed in the Senate, the bill was approved 107-39 in
the House. It now goes to Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our chance to send a signal that in Texas we believe
in individual responsibility, and that the money-hungry trial
lawyers need to be sent packing to find another industry,'' said
Rep. Rick Green, R-Dripping Springs, sponsor of the bill in the
House.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's opponents offered various amendments, including one
that would allow cities to block gun show sales made without a
criminal background check.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a gun person, I like guns,'' said Rep. Jim Dunnam, D-Waco,
who offered the amendment. But I don't think I should be able to
buy a gun without a background check.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier attempts to advance measures calling for such background
checks have failed both at the committee level and in the Senate.
The House defeated Dunnam's amendment 89-54.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the bill would prevent Texas jurisdictions from
joining a nationwide trend, modeled on successful litigation
against tobacco companies, forcing gunmakers to pay for the public
costs of violence from guns.
</P>
<P>
   Most suits in other states claim the industry is negligent for
not including more safety features. Damages are sought for
governmental expenses on police and emergency services, hospital
treatment and prosecutions related to gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   Exceptions in Texas would allow governmental entities to seek
legislative permission to file such lawsuits. In all other
instances, cities and counties could still sue for defective
equipment and any resulting injury or death.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would not prevent private individuals from suing
gunmakers for any other reason. In addition, the bill would allow
the Texas attorney general to sue on behalf of the state or any
other governmental unit.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents argued that the bill's provisions amounted to a
special immunity from liability for a particularly powerful private
interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am amazed we have a bill so strongly in favor to protect a
special interest group,'' said Rep. Juan Hinojosa, D-McAllen. ``I
have never seen a bill like this in my 14 years in the
Legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In light of the recent tragedies in this country, instead of
trying to find ways to reduce the number of guns available to
criminals and to juveniles, here we are trying to find ways to
protect the gun industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation's supporters, which include the National Rifle
Association, Texas State Rifle Association and gun sellers, argue
that such lawsuits are an attempt to impose gun policy through the
courts.
</P>
<P>
   During the past several months, New Orleans, Chicago, Miami-Dade
County, Atlanta and Bridgeport, Conn., have filed suits claiming
the gun companies are legally responsible for the harm their
products cause.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Legislature passed a bill similar to Lindsay's,
forcing a showdown between the state and the mayor of Atlanta over
the future of that city's litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Although no Texas jurisdiction has launched such a lawsuit,
opponents of the bill, including Texans Against Gun Violence, have
said the state should preserve the right to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sylvester Turner, D-Houston, tried to amend the bill to
allow any city or county that wished to pursue such a case to let
the voters decide.
</P>
<P>
   Turner challenged supporters of ``local control'' to vote for
his amendment, arguing members could protect the gun lobby and
still allow constituents to decide whether to sue them. The
amendment failed.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's opponents outside of the Legislature expanded beyond
the gun lobby in Texas to include tort reformers, who characterized
the wave of litigation against gunmakers as a money-making ploy by
trial lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Opelt, Houston-based executive director of Citizens Against
Lawsuit Abuse, said many industries have limited immunity from such
legal actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The makers of light aircraft and the providers of raw
materials for implanted medical devices have been granted special
protections,'' Opelt said. ``These are mistargeted lawsuits,''
</P>
<P>
   Houston Mayor Lee Brown and Harris County Attorney Michael P.
Fleming have passed on requests by anti-gun organizations to
initiate lawsuits on behalf of local taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a Scripps Howard Texas Poll found that 94 percent of
Texans do not blame gun makers for gun violence, and more than
two-thirds oppose letting cities and counties sue for damages.

BEST IN POLL: DEADEYE JACOBSEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LOUIS JOHNSON  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Glendora High swingman Casey Jacobsen and Artesia forward Jason
Kapono have met on the basketball floor often over the past few
years, and those meetings usually ended with Kapono and his team
walking away with a victory.
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of fact, Kapono and the Pioneers have ousted
Jacobsen and his Tartans from the CIF Division I Southern
California Regionals the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But now that both players are preparing to move on, Jacobsen
finally has beaten his rival and good friend. And he didn't even
need one of his long-range jump shots to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobsen, a 6-foot-6 swingman, amassed 280 points from the 20
ballots sent out to college coaches and prep basketball scouts to
outdistance Kapono and power forward Carlos Boozer of Douglas High
in Juneau, Alaska, to become the top vote-getter in the 23rd annual
Best in the West boys' basketball poll conducted by the Long Beach
Press-Telegram.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobsen, who missed most of the summer recruiting scene while
leading the U.S. Junior National Team to the gold medal in the
World Youth Games at Moscow, received eight No. 1 prospect votes.
The extra votes pushed Jacobsen past the others and gave the
sharpshooter the distinction of being the top basketball prospect
among high school seniors in the Western United States.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dunleavy Jr. of Jesuit High in Portland, Ore., and
Andrew Gooden of El Cerrito round out the top five in this year's
class. Dunleavy, a 6-8 swingman with an all-around game that rivals
Kapono's, is the son of Portland Trail Blazers coach Mike Dunleavy.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden, who wasn't on any of the top-100 lists of seniors
heading into last summer, burst onto the national scene at the
Adidas ABCD camp in Teaneck, N.J., where his combination of size
(6-10) and perimeter skills wowed onlookers.
</P>
<P>
   Louisville, Ky.-based talent scout Clark Francis of Hoop Scoop
thinks the Class of 1999 in the West compares favorably with the
1998 group. He placed the aforementioned players, along with Las
Vegas Clark point guard Kevin Gaines, who finished sixth in this
year's voting, among the top 40 players in the country, although he
was hesitant to anoint Jacobsen the best of the bunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure he's better than (Kapono or Boozer), but what he
did in the postseason All-Star games proved that he could play with
anyone in the class,'' Francis said. ``Six months ago, I thought
Casey had to go to the right program. But he could go anywhere and
be a factor for any program.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the other two players, Boozer is a 6-9 man-child and
a top-five talent in the country when he plays hard,'' Francis
said. ``Kapono, in terms of all-around skills, is just tremendous.
All three of those guys are real close, and the others aren't that
far behind.''
</P>
<P>
   The strength of this year's group lies in the frontcourt, where
eight of the 15 first-teamers stand 6-8 or taller. Kapono and 6-8
Donnell Knight of Tempe, Ariz., Corona del Sol, a dynamic athlete,
are the top small forwards. Boozer and Gooden join 6-9 Justin Davis
(Alameda St. Joseph), 6-10 Brian Jackson (Knappa, Ore., Knappa) and
6-11 Curtis Borchardt (Redmond, Wash., Eastlake) as power players
in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Tito Maddox, a 6-4 point guard from Compton, became the second
Tarbabe in as many years to be named to the first team, joining
former teammate David Hamilton (Auburn). Maddox, Gaines and Verbum
Dei magician Marlon Parmer are all considered to be among the best
floor leaders in the country.
</P>
<P>
   There are also plenty of players who can handle the shooting
guard or wing forward positions. Dunleavy, 6-4 Gilbert Arenas of
Grant, 6-5 Brian Wethers (Murrieta Murrieta Valley) and 6-5 Joe
Shipp (Fairfax) are all capable of scoring points in bunches on
slashes to the basket or with their perimeter jump shots.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Their bottom lines expanded by a booming stock
market and lucrative speaking fees, six of the candidates for
president reported assets of more than $1 million, according to
financial disclosure forms filed this week.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the way was Steve Forbes, the publisher, who reported
assets worth more than $19 million, much of it in stocks and three
properties in his hometown, Bedminster, N.J. Forbes, a Republican,
also received more than $644,000 last year from 24 speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, who is challenging Vice
President Al Gore for the Democratic nomination, reported assets of
at least $5.7 million and income of more than $2.6 million last
year, most of it from speaking fees.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has reported assets of $1.4 million to $1.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole, the former president of the American Red Cross
who is seeking the Republican nomination, reported assets of more
than $6 million. Mrs. Dole received $1.6 million from speeches over
the past 17 months, but gave $1.1 million of that to a charity, the
Elizabeth Dole Charitable Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Lamar Alexander, the former Tennessee governor who is also
running for the Republican nomination, reported assets worth more
than $6.8 million and nearly $1 million from the merger of a
company he helped start in 1987 with an investment of $6,300.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and his wife, Cindy,
reported assets of more than $9.7 million, which includes his
investments in a Phoenix beer distributor and several other
businesses in his home state. McCain also reported donating a
$70,833 book advance to charity.
</P>
<P>
   Four other Republican candidates, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas,
the conservative activist Gary Bauer, former Vice President Dan
Quayle and the commentator Pat Buchanan have been given 45-day
extensions to file their reports.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley reported owning several million dollars in stocks and
bonds, including more than $1 million in the BankAmerica Corp. He
received $1.6 million for 64 speeches, $171,042 for lectures at
Stanford University, the University of Maryland and Notre Dame
University, and $126,953 in pension payments from the National
Basketball Association and the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   He also received $431,250 as a consultant, mainly on
international economic issues, to the Morgan Guaranty Trust Co.,
J.P. Morgan Services and the Gartner Group of Stamford, Conn.
Bradley has ended his relationship with the three companies, an
aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley reported owning property in Athens, 80 acres of
unimproved land in Nova Scotia, Canada, and a house in Washington,
part of which he rents.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, who is expected to self-finance much of his campaign,
reported receiving $42,007 from a family farm in Bedminster and a
$2.2 million salary from Forbes Family Holdings, the family's
publishing company, of which Forbes is president and editor in
chief. He also reported liabilities of more than $4.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Mrs. Dole's assets were in stocks and bonds, including
more than $1 million in a Riggs Prime Money Market Fund. Her
husband, former Senator Bob Dole, reported that his consulting
company, Bob Dole Enterprises, was worth more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander reported receiving $970,000 from the merger last year
of Bright Horizons Family Solutions, a Cambridge, Mass., company
that provides day care services to businesses, which he helped
start in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   He received $420,000 from stock options he was given as a board
member of the Learning Co., a company in Cambridge, Mass., that
produces educational software, according to the report. And
Alexander received $235,000 for serving as a director of three
other companies, $88,000 in legal fees and $76,000 in speaking
fees.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his home, he reported owning two rental
properties in Knoxville and a vacation house on 35 acres in
Walland, Tenn.

12TH DEATH ROW INMATE IN ILLINOIS IS CLEARED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn., Neb.)  (mk) 
 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ For the 12th time in the last 12 years, an Illinois
inmate on death row has been spared by evidence showing a wrongful
murder conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors in Cook County on Monday dropped rape and murder
charges against the inmate, Ronald Jones, after DNA tests revealed
that he could not have been the source of semen in the victim's
body.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth time this year that a death row inmate in
Illinois had been exonerated.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 49, remained in custody because he faced an outstanding
warrant in Tennessee for escaping from a work-release sentence in
1980.
</P>
<P>
   When Jones was convicted of rape and murder in Chicago in 1989,
a prosecutor described him as a ``cold brutal rapist'' who ``should
never see the light of day again.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors announced on Monday that they had dropped the
charges after interviewing more than 100 witnesses involved in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   The conviction was thrown out two years ago after the DNA
results. But Jones waited an additional 22 months in Cook County
jail while prosecutors debated whether to bring a second trial.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said at his trial that he had confessed to the rape and
murder of a Chicago woman only because police had beaten him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just couldn't take it no more,'' he had testified.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Anthony Porter came within two days of being executed
in Illinois before being exonerated of murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers in Illinois are considering a special fund that
prosecutors and defense lawyers could use to pay for additional
experts and investigators in capital cases.
</P>
<P>
   These cases have given ammunition to opponents of the death
penalty, and to groups like the American Bar Association, calling
for a moratorium on executions.
</P>
<P>
   In Nebraska, the state Legislature appears likely to pass a
measure that would impose a two-year moratorium on the death
penalty, while its application is being studied for its fairness.
</P>
<P>
   Around the country, more than 60 criminal convictions have been
overturned after DNA results showed wrongful convictions.
</P>
<P>
   According to a confession written by Jones, the victim had
agreed to have sex with him for $5 and then pulled a knife when he
refused to pay. She was killed in the ensuing struggle, the
confession stated.
</P>
<P>
   Even after DNA results showed Jones did not rape the woman,
investigators initially worked on a theory that he was acting with
an accomplice.
</P>
<P>
   The victim, a 28-year-old mother of three children, was beaten
and stabbed in a motel room on Chicago's South Side in March 1985.
Jones was arrested seven months later.
</P>
<P>
   In the Tennessee case, Jones had received a five-year sentence
for robbery and was on a 12-hour pass in Memphis when he failed to
return for an 8 p.m. curfew.

PROCEDURES PROPOSED FOR NEW SPECIAL PROSECUTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A bipartisan commission headed by two former Senate
majority leaders recommended Tuesday that when the independent
counsel law expires next month, it be replaced with new procedures
allowing the attorney general to appoint special prosecutors to
investigate whether top officials had committed crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, the special prosecutor would have full
authority to conduct grand jury proceedings, issue indictments,
conduct trials and appeal decisions. But in contrast with the
current system, the attorney general would have considerable
control over the scope, cost and length of the investigations.
</P>
<P>
   In a preface to the report, the former majority leaders, Bob
Dole, a Republican from Kansas, and George J. Mitchell, a Democrat
from Maine, said they had set out to consider how the independent
counsel statute should be revised if Congress decided to renew it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is now evident,'' the former Senators said, that ``the act
will not be renewed. The focus of our report is thus now on the
inescapable question of what should follow next month's final
sunset of the act.''
</P>
<P>
   There is little political support for the existing law, which
expires on June 30. Most Republicans in Congress never thought much
of the law in the first place. And most Democrats believe that
Kenneth W. Starr exceeded proper bounds in his investigation of
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The commission was organized by the Brookings Institution and
the American Enterprise Institute, leading research centers here.
The findings and recommendations were spelled out in an article by
Dole and Mitchell on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general has the authority to name special
prosecutors, but the commission proposed that the procedures be
spelled out in law.
</P>
<P>
   It recommended that the attorney general appoint a special
prosecutor when a normal Justice Department investigation would
pose a conflict of interest. The prosecutor would have full
authority to conduct an independent investigation, bring charges
and try cases.
</P>
<P>
   But after two years and each year after that, the attorney
general would be required to review the work of the prosecutor and
decide whether the investigation should continue or be ended.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Dole and Mitchell, the commission members were
Zoe Baird, president of the Markle Foundation; Drew S. Days III, a
former solicitor general and assistant attorney general; Carla
Anderson Hills, former United States trade representative and
secretary of Housing and Urban Development; former Rep. Bill Paxon,
R-N.Y.; John G. Roberts Jr., former deputy solicitor general;
former Rep. David E. Skaggs, D-Colo.; former Attorney General
Richard Thornburgh; and Mark H. Tuohey III, who was deputy
independent counsel in the Whitewater investigation in 1994 and
1995.

 By W.H. STICKNEY JR.  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The telephone had been the enemy, lying so frustratingly silent for
months, never bringing the anticipated news that the collapse of
the American Basketball League had been just a nightmare.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Then it rang, alerting Kara Wolters that future paychecks would
be forthcoming not just from the solvent WNBA but from the two-time
defending league champion Comets.
</P>
<P>
   Wolters, a 6-7 center who in 1995 helped Connecticut become only
the second undefeated NCAA women's champion, on May 4 had been
picked in the third round, the 36th player taken in the deepest
draft the WNBA has conducted.
</P>
<P>
   But the phone call from Comets coach/general manager Van
Chancellor was anticlimactic. Wolters had been monitoring the draft
through the Internet and knew of her fate before chatting with
Chancellor. Nothing could dent her excitement, though, including a
call that came far later than she imagined.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of funny when he called me,'' Wolters said
Tuesday. ``He said, `Big 'un, I've been tryin' to get ahold of ya.'
I was excited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little nervous at the draft. I was a little surprised
that I went so late. But the more I thought about it later, I was
so pleased and excited to be in Houston, it was OK that I went so
late.''
</P>
<P>
   There would be another phone conversation that day, one that
sent Wolters' spirits even higher. Jennifer Rizzotti, Wolters' 5-6
former teammate at Connecticut and with the ABL New England
Blizzard, was taken by the Comets in the fourth round, the 48th of
50 players selected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ecstatic about being in Houston and playing for such a
terrific team and for such a great coach,'' Wolters said. ``And on
top of everything, I have Jen Rizzotti here.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolters is uncertain who called whom with the good news.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were both trying to track each other down,'' she said.
``When I heard her name called (in the draft), it was like a sigh
of relief. I was thinking, `Yes! I've got my buddy with me.' I was
so excited we got to go together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like we were rookies again. And we get to go
through the experience together. We have each other. That makes it
a little easier.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wolters-Rizzotti portion of the UConn Connection has been
yoked for the better part of the past five years. Wolters was the
Final Four Most Valuable Player in 1995 when the Huskies beat
perennial powerhouse Tennessee to complete a 35-0 season and grab
the school's first and only NCAA crown.
</P>
<P>
   She was the Big East and Associated Press Player of the Year in
1996-97 and graduated as Connecticut's all-time leading rebounder.
</P>
<P>
   Rizzotti has a similar rsum. She was the Wade Trophy recipient
in 1996, the AP Player of the Year for '95-96 and the Francis
Pomeroy Naismith Award winner that same season.
</P>
<P>
   Wolters and Rizzotti were reunited for more than two years on
the pro level as members of the Blizzard, which routinely set
attendance records in the ABL.
</P>
<P>
   And what could be better than extending the UConn Connection to
Houston and chasing a WNBA championship ring along with Cynthia
Cooper, Sheryl Swoopes and Tina Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fantastic to play for such a phenomenal team,'' Rizzotti
said. ``It's hard to believe that of all the 50 (draftees) to get
drafted by the 12 different (WNBA) teams, we are on the same team
again. It's a nice little coincidence for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolters and Rizzotti have weathered the spectrum of emotions
over the past six months to arrive on coincidence's doorstep. There
was the sadness and disappointment of this past December when, five
days before Christmas, news arrived that the ABL, barely 2{ years
old, was closing its doors and filing for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not a very good Christmas for all of us,'' Rizzotti
said. ``It was probably the first time that most of us would
probably rather have not been home for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we've bounced back from it. I think all of the players
wanted to be in one league anyway. So it just happened a little
sooner than later.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of the former ABL players, Wolters and Rizzotti
weren't left in the cold when the league folded. They could take
solace from the knowledge each was talented enough to gain more
than casual notice from the WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   But that was tinged with frustration when the animosity between
the WNBA and its newly formed players union postponed the draft for
a week and threatened to scuttle the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an emotional roller coaster,'' Rizzotti said, ``from
being shocked and disappointed at the league folding, to getting
back in the mindset of working out, getting ready. Having to wait
and see where I was going to get drafted, that was pretty
nerve-racking. But I'm excited to come down here.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a little bit of anxiety to know where I'm going to fit
in. But so far, it's been great.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been an up-and-down journey. And neither is assured a
berth on the Comets' 11-player roster.
</P>
<P>
   But they've played the waiting game before. What's another few
weeks? &QL;

COMMENTARY: LEECH WOMEN IN LOVE! 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A colleague once brought me a present from Sunset Strip: a
vintage poster of a B movie called ``The Leech Woman,'' a 1959
horror classic. The poster showed a voluptuous woman ensnaring a
young man, with the legend: ``LEECH WOMAN! She drains men of their
love and lives!''
</P>
<P>
   This breed of she-monster is making an alarming comeback. The
leeching ladies are everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   There is the Leech Woman of the boomer generation, the
indefatigably exhibitionistic Joyce Maynard, who has asked
Sotheby's to auction 14 romantic letters that J.D. Salinger wrote
to her in 1972 and '73. The publicity-phobic writer has been the
object of Ms. Maynard's leech for quite awhile.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the Gen-X Leech Woman, the indefatigably
exhibitionistic Monica Lewinsky, who insists, all her alleged
humiliation notwithstanding, on not going away. The object of her
leech, which will likely also last quite awhile, is the
privacy-phobic president.
</P>
<P>
   These two highly skilled predators keep trying to extract
celebrity from old love affairs that were not only brief and
puerile but sexually tortured. They want to gain immortality _ and
big bucks _ by feeding off the detritus of their  &UR; triste &LR;  trysts
with older, famous men.
</P>
<P>
   If they were microscopic organisms, we would call them
parasites. They are worse than social climbers. They are sexual
climbers.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the long, dark ages of undisputed patriarchy, women
connived to trade beauty and sex for affluence and status.
</P>
<P>
   But aren't we supposed to have evolved beyond these sorts of
crass trade-offs? Aren't we supposed to make our own way, without
reverting to pillaging the identities of men, and peddling their
love messages, to inflate our own identities?
</P>
<P>
   Monica got huffy on a recent publicity tour designed to drum up
flagging sales of her book when interviewers had the temerity to
ask about the book. As she hawked her affair, she took offense at
the suggestion that it was all that is interesting about her. It is
an essential characteristic of the Leech Woman to believe that she
is independent, that she has a self beyond the self that preys. She
is a cross between a vamp and a vampire who wants to be treated
like a movie star.
</P>
<P>
   As Tom Shales, the TV critic of The Washington Post, pointed out
after Ms. Lewinsky's smirky ``Slutterday Night Live'' appearance,
as he called it: ``This is one of the most discomforting things
about Lewinsky's protracted romp in the limelight; she doesn't seem
to know what she's famous for.''
</P>
<P>
   It is truly frightening to think that Monica might try to feed
off her affair with Bill for as long as Joyce has fed off hers with
Jerry.
</P>
<P>
   After writing a memoir about the nine-month romance she began as
a Yale student, the 45-year-old Ms. Maynard has now found yet
another way to recycle her ancient escapade. Sotheby's has
estimated that the letters of the author who hated price tags will
sell for $60,000 to $80,000. The world's most confessional woman
says she has to betray the world's most unconfessional man because
she needs money to pay for college for her children. Malarkey.
</P>
<P>
   I went to Sotheby's to have a gander at the notorious letters.
The exercise was fascinating and a little creepy. The 53-year-old
author kept warning his 18-year-old friend about the ways that
celebrity and conspicuousness can warp talent. Now those warnings
against exploitation are being exploited. His counsel for privacy
and subtlety are being publicly and unsubtly sold to the highest
bidder.
</P>
<P>
   The typed and handwritten letters have a swift arc, the usual
one. He goes from wanting to meet her to meeting her, from asking
her to ``stop -Salingering me'' to ``Jerry S.,'' to ``XXX, J.,'' to
``It's late, Kiddo, and I'm tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the president, the author of ``The Catcher in the Rye'' was
both mentor and seducer. In one letter, Salinger advises his Joyce
to write a play in which she can star. Poor man. That is exactly
what she did. She has made the story of their romance as
long-running as ``Cats.''
</P>
<P>
   There are those who say that these women were victims of older
men, and so have a right to revenge. But experiencing the ordinary
brutality of love does not make one a victim. It makes one an
adult. Or it should.

STUDY LABELS `ROBIN HOOD' SCHOOL PLAN IN TEXAS A SUCCESS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By THADDEUS HERRICK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO, Texas _ The so-called Robin Hood school funding
plan that shifted money from rich districts to poor ones has closed
the performance gap in the state's basic skills test, a new study
concludes.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas A&AMP;M University study indicates the plan has brought
parity to the results of the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills,
lifting the scores of poorer, largely minority districts over the
past several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the purposes of Robin Hood was to take away the
advantages of wealthy districts in terms of TAAS scores,'' said
Kenneth Meier, a Texas A&AMP;M professor and director of the Texas
Educational Excellence Project, which directed the study. ``Our
conclusion is that it's been a success.''
</P>
<P>
   The study is believed to be the first of its kind to examine the
impact of the Robin Hood law on academic performance in Texas and
is a validation of sorts for those who battled arduously for equal
funding. Approved in 1993, equalization stemmed from a lawsuit by
the state's poor school districts, most notably San Antonio's
largely Hispanic Edgewood school system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We argued that students in poor districts would do better
under a fairer distribution of funds,'' said Al Kauffman, a lawyer
with the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund who
represented Edgewood. ``To the extent it's moving in that
direction, we're happy to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kauffman added that the very schools that benefited from
equalization still face enormous challenges, among them lagging ACT
and SAT scores, high dropout rates and poor college enrollment
rates.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which included all Texas school districts, examined
the effect of the school funding plan on the performance of Anglo,
Hispanic, African-American and low-income students in the basic
skills test. It found that equalization not only eliminated the
advantages of local money but also increased the importance of
state money in shaping student performance.
</P>
<P>
   While Meier and his colleagues say they have established a clear
link between school funding and academic performance, others are
skeptical. Such a relationship has long been called into question
in the academic field, and at least one University of Texas scholar
describes it as ``weak and small.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If national researchers have had a very hard time finding any
independent effect of money on student outcomes, I am suspicious of
Meier et al not only claiming that money matters, but that
equalization also matters,'' said Jay Greene, a University of Texas
professor and expert on public education.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 Houston Chronicle series on Edgewood concluded that
hundreds of millions of dollars in Robin Hood money had made little
difference in that San Antonio district. Though TAAS scores were
higher, Edgewood had failed to close the gap with the state
average.
</P>
<P>
   While most experts agree that equalization is essentially good,
they are divided over whether school funding is a legitimate means
for education reform. Detractors in Texas and nationwide are
increasingly looking toward solutions such as increased competition
among schools and vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Edgewood is the site of potentially the
largest private voucher experiment in the country, with a
pro-voucher group giving out $50 million in scholarships for
district residents to enroll in mostly private schools. The results
of that effort will not be known for several years.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas A&AMP;M study found that students in Texas school
districts with higher local revenue performed better on TAAS during
the 1994-95 school year than those students in poorer districts.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, in the 1996-97 school year, the study found no
relationship between district wealth and the basic skills test for
any students, among them Anglos, Hispanics, African-Americans and
students of low income.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although we were primarily interested in the effects of local
revenues and district wealth on student performance, we were
careful to control for a variety of other inputs known to shape
student performance,'' said Jerry Polinard, a University of Texas
Pan American scholar, who participated in the study.
</P>
<P>
   Among those other factors: average teacher salaries, teacher
experience and student-teacher ratios.
</P>
<P>
   But Greene criticized the methodology of the study, saying Meier
and his colleagues are inferring their results from changes over
time, when in fact many things change over time. He proposed a
study that seeks to establish whether states with a greater degree
of equal funding have better test scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that if they want to prove something about
equalization, they should measure it directly,'' Greene said.
</P>
<P>
   Meier, however, dismissed the criticism, saying sarcastically
that the change in academic performance among poorer students might
be attributed to sunspots. He likened equal funding to a level
playing field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a positive sign that the state's school finance system is
moving in a direction where local wealth is redistributed to ensure
that no particular student group will reap its advantages to the
exclusion of others,'' Meier said.
</P>

ANNAN TAKES CRITICAL STANCE ON U.S. ACTIONS IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Reflecting frustration over his organization's
marginalization in Kosovo, Secretary General Kofi Annan criticized
the United States on Tuesday for taking military action without
Security Council blessing and China and Russia for having ignored
the ethnic purging that led to NATO's bombing.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech at The Hague commemorating the centenary of the
first International Peace Conference, Annan did not identify those
Security Council members by name, but he warned that the inability
of the 15-member council to achieve consensus on Kosovo and other
critical issues threatened both the United Nations and
international peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless the Security Council is restored to its pre-eminent
position as the sole source of legitimacy on the use of force,''
Annan said, in the text distributed here on Tuesday, ``we are on a
dangerous path to anarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally important, he continued, unless the Security Council
``can unite around the aim of confronting massive human rights
violations and crimes against humanity on the scale of Kosovo, then
we will betray the very ideals that inspired the founding of the
United Nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan said the ``Council's unity and inaction in the face of
genocide'' in Rwanda was flawed, as was its ``division, and
regional action'' in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Both times, he said, U.N. members ``should have been able to
find common ground in upholding the principles of the Charter, and
find unity in defense of our common humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.N. official stressed that Annan was not singling out
the United States and its allies particularly for using force
without Security Council sanction. The official cited at least six
other conflicts in the last five years, most of them in Africa, in
which individual states or regional groups resorted to force with
explicit council authorization.
</P>
<P>
   Annan's speech, he noted, also criticized states for
``flouting'' Security Council sanctions and other unidentified
states for failing to cooperate with the council in ``disarmament
and nonproliferation,'' or with efforts by the International
Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia to bring war criminals to
justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a blast at anybody,'' the official said. ``It is a
statement of concern about a growing trend _ the bypassing of the
Security Council _ which he wants member states to think about.''
</P>
<P>
   The official stressed that Annan was not abandoning his earlier
qualified support for NATO's action. ``After 55 days of bombing, he
still says that the use of force was necessary,'' the official
explained.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Annan's speech on Tuesday differed somewhat in tone and
emphasis from his previous statements, which focused more heavily
on the human rights abuses taking place in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   His speech also cited ``the emergence of the single superpower
and new regional powers'' and ``the preference for so-called
coalitions of the willing'' as having contributed to the increasing
resort to unauthorized force.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the U.S. mission agreed that Annan's remarks
differed from his previous statements on the conflict, but declined
to criticize him. ``Let's just say we prefer his earlier
speeches,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We share his disappointment that the council lacked consensus
and was unable to take action against the Serbs' ethnic cleansing
in Kosovo,'' James B. Foley, a State Department spokesman, said on
Tuesday. ``And we see as extremely positive his reaction that the
bombing was necessary.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Washington has not hidden its opposition to Annan's efforts
to help mediate an end to the conflict. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright has made clear that negotiations with the
Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, should be handled through
the Russian envoy, Viktor Chernomyrdin, and President Martti
Ahtisaari of Finland, who represents the European Union and has
supported NATO's goals.
</P>
<P>
   Annan had considerable difficulty appointing two envoys, Carl
Bildt, a former Swedish prime minister, and Eduard Kukan,
Slovakia's foreign minister, to help his mediation efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats here said that Washington was particularly
unenthusiastic about Bildt's selection because of his critical
comments about the NATO air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Kukan said he and Bildt would
meet with Albright in Washington on Wednesday to discuss their
role.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department, eager to avoid a proliferation of would-be
mediators, has urged Annan and his envoys to limit their efforts to
refugee assistance, and to reconstruction after a peace settlement
is achieved.
</P>
<P>
   Kukan said that China, one of the council's five permanent
council members with veto powers, remained adamant that the council
should not discuss peace talks or a peace plan until NATO stops its
air strikes.

BLACK MAN'S DEATH RAISES RACIAL TENSIONS IN DETROIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The beating death of an unarmed black man in front of
his children at a neighborhood gas station has sparked four days of
protests here that have brought into the open the festering racial
tensions between blacks and Arab-Americans who own many small
businesses in the inner city.
</P>
<P>
   The black man, Kalvin Porter, 34, got into a fight with two
Arab-American clerks at the gas station Friday after one made an
inappropriate remark to Porter's 12-year-old stepdaughter, police
said. Porter, who was also accompanied by his four young children,
was then beaten to death by the clerks, one of whom was carrying a
lug wrench, according to police reports and Detroit Police Chief
Benny Napoleon. The clerks, Fadhel Mazeb, 46, and Adel Altam, 26,
were charged with second-degree murder and pleaded not guilty. They
remain in custody.
</P>
<P>
   The incident has drawn nightly demonstrations by up to 200
people since Friday, with protesters demanding that the gas station
be closed. They vow not to allow the station to reopen unless it
changes hands and is run by blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Porter's death is a tragic example of festering problems
of ill will and ill feelings'' between African-Americans and some
Arab-American store operators, said the Rev. Wendell Anthony,
president of the Detroit chapter of the NAACP. ``The
African-American community has too long been the victim of
mistreatment and disrespect by some who operate and work in stores
and gas stations in our neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Arab-American leaders said Porter's death was not a racial
matter. ``How many Arab-Americans have been killed in their
stores?'' asked Osama Siblani, publisher and editor of the
Arab-American News, a weekly newspaper. The paper is published in
the Detroit suburb of Dearborn, the center of the nation's largest
Arab-American community.
</P>
<P>
   Siblani said 500 Arab-Americans had been killed in the Detroit
area, mostly by African-Americans, in the last decade. ``But you
didn't see Arab-Americans demonstrating in front of
African-American churches, he added.''
</P>
<P>
   Porter was killed at a Sunoco station on the city's east side,
in a neighborhood where buildings are guarded by fences with razor
wire. In intermittent rain, about 35 protesters gathered at the
station Monday night carrying signs reading ``Don't burn them down,
shut them down,'' and ``Arabs killed our brother.'' Passing cars
and tractor-trailers honked in support as they drove past the
picket line.
</P>
<P>
   One protester, Minister Malik Shabazz, said Porter's death hit a
nerve because of racial and class tensions between African-American
residents and Arab-American merchants.
</P>
<P>
   ``They own the stores, we are the customers,'' said Shabazz, who
is black.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters told of being harassed by attendants at the gas
station, which also functioned as the neighborhood grocery store.
Eric Hansard, 19, who lives a few blocks away, said clerks so often
accused him and other teen-agers of stealing that he stopped
shopping at the store. Others told of poor treatment at other
Arab-American-owned stores elsewhere in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers stood guard as the station owner, Steve Mallah,
watched the demonstration from his darkened gas station and said he
did not blame the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a tragedy here,'' Mallah said. ``I feel for his
family.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mallah, who has owned the store for 10 years and said he had
never had problems with anyone in the neighborhood, added that the
two clerks charged in the beating were in custody, while he and his
store were caught up in the larger atmosphere of racial tensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here in the business not to kill people or to fight with
people,'' Mallah said. ``I'm here to make a living. By shutting
down the station, they don't solve any problems. They just make
another victim _ which is me.''

CALPERS ALLOWS INCREASES IN HEALTH PREMIUMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Minn.)   (af)  
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the first sign that the cost of health care insurance could
rise 9 percent to 11 percent again next year, the nation's
second-biggest buyer of health benefits said Tuesday that it had
agreed to an average increase of 9.7 percent in premiums for
California's state and local government workers.
</P>
<P>
   The California Public Employees Retirement System, which
negotiates coverage for a million people, said Kaiser Permanente,
the financially troubled health maintenance organization that
covers some 400,000 people in the system, would get the largest
increase, an average 11.7 percent. That is on top of 10.75 percent
for 1999 for Kaiser, which has been losing about $1 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts said the increases would lift profits for
managed care companies, many of which have had low profit margins.
But a group that bargains for 21 big California employers has been
exploring long-range strategies that include bypassing HMOs and
dealing directly with hospitals and doctors.
</P>
<P>
   In bargaining for big increases, the HMOs said they had to pay
more to struggling groups of California doctors and hospitals, some
pushed to the brink of bankruptcy after years of relatively low
payments.
</P>
<P>
   But Edward Keaney, a health care analyst at Volpe Brown Whelan &AMP;
Co. in San Francisco, said that even 1 percent added to HMO profits
would be significant for companies like Foundation Health Systems,
which has margins of about 2.5 percent, and Pacificare, which is in
the 4 percent range.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying costs for hospitals and doctors have been rising
5 percent to 6 percent, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Stanley, health benefits administrator for Calpers, the

PENNEY PLANS INITIATIVES TO RAISE $6 BILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   J.C. Penney reported lower first-quarter earnings Tuesday but
announced two initiatives that could raise as much as $6 billion in
revenue. The news sent the company's previously lagging stock price
up 9.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended May 1, the retailer reported net income of
$167 million, or 61 cents a diluted share, compared with $174
million, or 64 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The results were 8 cents better than Wall Street expectations,
according to First Call Corp., which tracks company earnings, but
hardly impressive because they come at a time when many other
retail chains have reported unusually robust earnings gains.
</P>
<P>
   But Penney, based in Plano, Texas, kept its stock from taking a
hit by announcing the two revenue-raising initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   First, the company said it was looking to sell its credit card
business. Penney is the fourth-biggest store card issuer, with
receivables of about $3.71 billion at the end of the quarter. The
company expects to get roughly a dollar for every dollar of
receivables and to use the proceeds to pay down its debt. Theda
Page-Whitehead, a company spokeswoman, said negotiations were under
way, but she declined to identify the potential purchaser.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the company said it would sell a 20 percent stake
in Eckerd Corp., a fast-growing drug store chain, to the public as
a tracking stock, which will reflect Eckerd's financial results and
will not include Penney's other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Eckerd, which has 2,900 stores in 22 states, had sales of $10.3
billion last year. But the chain's operating income for the year
ended Jan. 31 was $254 million, down 26.8 percent from results in
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts estimate the sale of Eckerd stock could raise $1
billion to $2 billion. The proceeds will be used to buy back stock,
the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Penney's motives in selling a stake in Eckerd are clearly to
unlock some of the unit's value. The department store's stock
trades at about 18 times estimated earnings, whereas stocks for big
drug store chains trade at much higher multiples.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drug stores at this size are trading at a multiple of 44 times
earnings,'' said Burt Flickinger III, a retail consultant with
Reach Marketing in Westport, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The initiatives, which the company expects to complete in the
fourth quarter, were treated as generally good news by Wall Street,
where Penney's shares rose $4.4375, to $50.125, in heavy trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first move that this management has done in a long
while to show it cares about creating shareholder value,'' said
Dana Cohen, a retail analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Inc.
</P>
<P>
   But some thought that the response was too optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reaction to stock is completely overblown compared with
the magnitude of the announcements,'' said Richard Church, a retail
analyst with Salomon Smith Barney. ``The sale of the receivables
portfolio is going to generate fewer savings than most people
believe. I don't think there is going to be any impact on earnings
per share. What you save in interest expense you give up in credit
income.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also raised concerns that Penney was using sleights of
hand to distract investors from more fundamental problems.
Certainly, the nation's second-largest retailer has been
struggling. Sales growth has remained stagnant as discounters like
Target, a unit of Dayton Hudson, and Old Navy, a unit of Gap Inc.,
which sells hip low-price speciality clothing, are stealing its
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that is glaringly absent is any kind of sign that
they are going to do better with the core business,'' said Kurt
Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report. ``They are
pushing the stock price up for now, but a year from now the problem
will be the same, because the company has a complete lack of
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   But Penney's chief executive, James Oesterreicher, said, not for
the first time, that the department store was on the verge of a
turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the month of April our top eight brands had revenue
increases in the double digits,'' he said. Penney's private brands
include St. John's Bay and Arizona Jean Co. Oesterreicher said the
company would continue to emphasize these speciality brands and
predicted sales in stores open a year, a key measure of sales
growth, would be positive for the company's third and fourth
quarters.

FEDERAL PANEL CALLS FOR MORE LIMITS ON LEGAL GAMBLING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Pressing toward a mid-June deadline, a federal
commission Tuesday recommended several restrictions on legalized
gambling, including a call for states to consider ``gambling impact
statements'' before approving new lotteries, casinos, or
racetracks.
</P>
<P>
   A day after urging a ban on any wagering on collegiate sports,
which currently is allowed in Nevada and Oregon, the National
Gambling Impact Study Commission also decided to recommend tighter
restrictions on state-run lotteries and more regulation of casino
gambling, including on Indian reservations.
</P>
<P>
   The nine-member commission cautioned against allowing
financially troubled pari-mutuel facilities to expand their
operations to include casino gambling, a tactic similar to what was
proposed two years ago at Sam Houston Race Park in northwest
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Created two years ago, the commission has no authority to
implement any of its recommendations. Instead, they will be
included in a report, due June 18, to the president, Congress,
state governors and Indian tribal governments.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's final meeting before submitting its report is set
for June 2-3 in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, commissioners postponed action on a proposal to push
for barring gambling interests from donating to elected officials'
campaign funds. Also put off was a proposal rebuking American
Indian casinos that refused to respond to a commission survey about
their gaming operations.
</P>
<P>
   The commission earlier approved recommendations to ban Internet
gambling and wagering by anyone younger than 21. The panel also
wants casinos and lotteries to post notices explaining the odds of
winning at various games and the dangers and risks of gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the commission voted 5-4 to slow two decades of
rapid growth in legalized gambling by suggesting a nationwide
moratorium on new casinos, lotteries, and pari-mutuel wagering
operations. Since then, three states have moved toward legalizing
casinos and three others have taken steps toward going into the
lottery business.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the commission voted to recommend that state and
local governments be required to consider forecasts of the social
and economic effects on communities before legalizing any form of
gambling or adding a gaming facility. The forecasts would be much
like the environmental studies required before streams can be
dammed or land can be developed.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Robert Loescher, an Alaska businessman,
characterized the impact statement as anti-business and an obstacle
to communities and companies wanting to engage in legal activity.
``This becomes a holdup ... a delay,'' he complained.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner John Wilhelm, president of the Hotel Employees and
Restaurant Employees Union, agreed, but added: ``I don't think
that's bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Among recommendations that commissioners approved for their
report are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Tougher truth-in-advertising laws aimed at lotteries and
tribal gambling operations.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ending aggressive advertising campaigns by state lotteries
designed to woo young and lower-income Americans.
</P>
<P>
   _ Barring state lotteries from moving into casino-style instant
games, such as video poker and slot machines.
</P>
<P>
   _ Removing ``convenience gambling'' machines, such as video
poker, from neighborhood stores and taverns.
</P>
<P>
   _ Banning automated teller machines from race tracks and
casinos.
</P>
<P>
   _ Prohibiting casino ``cruises to nowhere'' unless they are
allowed by the states in which the ships dock.
</P>
<P>
   _ Spending a portion of state tax or tribal proceeds from casino
operations on researching, preventing and treating problem
gamblers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Preventing horse-track operators and other pari-mutuel
operations from introducing casino-style gaming to help bail out
economically troubled facilities or competing with other forms of
gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Until two years ago, Houston businessman Charles Hurwitz lobbied
the Texas Legislature to allow him to add card-game wagering, such
as poker and blackjack, at Sam Houston Race Park as it emerged from
bankruptcy. Hurwitz did not seek approval for other casino-style
gambling, like roulette wheels or craps. State lawmakers turned him
down. The track currently reports operating at a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's decision by the commission to push for an end to all
legalized gambling on collegiate sports rankled Rep. Jim Gibbons, a
Nevada Republican who predicted the proposal would never be enacted
by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``This proposal has about as much chance of becoming law as I
have of hitting a home run off Greg Maddux,'' Gibbons said Tuesday,
referring to the Atlanta Braves' near-perennial Cy Young winner.
``This recommendation is a clear violation of states' rights. I
will forcefully fight it if it is introduced in Congress.''

 &HT;    LBJ High Grad Phones Austin Students From Mt. Everest Summit
 &HT;    By Dick Stanley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Austinite Jacek Maselko stood Tuesday on the
roof of the world _ the summit of Mount Everest _ joining more than
1,000 people who have reached the peak since 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Maselko, 29, believed to be the first Austinite to reach the
summit of the 29,028-foot mountain, climbed for about five hours
Tuesday to accomplish the feat. His ascent comes 46 years after Sir
Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay made it to the top.
</P>
<P>
   A biologist and part owner of Patagonia Mountain Agency reached
the summit with his client Tadeusz Kudelski, and his boss, Ryszard
Pawlowski, a veteran Everest summiteer who followed them. He also
took along with him students of the LBJ Science Academy in Austin,
via the Internet and satellite phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   When he reached the summit Tuesday, Maselko gulped oxygen from a
portable bottle and then _ finding the speech that he had
momentarily lost _ described for the awed Austin students his view
from the top of Mount Everest.
</P>
<P>
   ``All he could see was clouds,'' said 16-year-old Lindsay
Zuloaga. ``He was above everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Maselko is a 1989 LBJ High School graduate who frequently led
adventuresome science students on thrilling trips to Guadalupe Peak
and other Texas climbing haunts.
</P>
<P>
   As he braved the below-zero temperatures and tortuous winds of
Mount Everest, students tracked his progress daily and kept in
touch through satellite phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   In his call to students Tuesday, static on the phone consumed
most of Maselko's words. But Zuloaga and eight other students,
seven parents and LBJ science teacher Jackson Pace got the message.
</P>
<P>
   Especially when Maselko clearly said ``Sic 'em Jags,'' a
reference to the northeast Austin school's mascot, the Jaguar.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was really inspiring,'' said Pace, who coordinated the
students' share of the adventure and spent Monday night with them
in the LBJ Science Academy's office so they could take the 3:10
a.m. call.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all exhausted,'' said Sarah Parks, 15, ``so we could
sympathize with what they were going through.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a sunny Tuesday afternoon on Everest when Maselko and the
others reached the summit, where daytime temperatures are tens of
degrees below zero. Maselko let a Polish client precede him to the
summit.
</P>
<P>
   His group had been delayed almost a week by a snowstorm that
reportedly cost the lives of two members of some of the 23 other
commercial groups ascending the Himalayan mountain this spring. But
Maselko and the others stayed atop Everest only an hour, coming
down when a growing wind made it dangerous to linger.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens have died in expeditions up Mount Everest, including
eight during a May 1996 expedition. While Maselko was making his
summit, a group of climbers discovered the frozen body of British
mountaineer George Mallory, who died in 1924 while trying to reach
the summit.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday morning, Pace got confirmation that the climbers
were safely back at Camp 3 on Everest's north flank.
</P>
<P>
   Maselko plans to call the Science Academy students again today
but it will be later this summer, on a planned visit to Austin,
before he can show them the pebbles he took as mementoes from the
top of the world.

SENATE INACTION KILLS DOZENS OF TEXAS BILLS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Hate crimes legislation wasn't the only casualty
of last weekend's deadline for Senate committees to approve House
bills.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of other bills that cleared the House were killed by
Senate inaction, including proposals to exempt school supplies from
sales taxes and prohibit the Legislature from meeting on the
national holiday honoring the late Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Although some of the stranded House bills theoretically could
resurface as amendments to still-viable measures, many appeared
moribund for this legislative session.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's dead. The bill is dead,'' Rep. Ron Wilson, D-Houston,
said Tuesday, describing his failed proposal to ban open containers
of alcohol in vehicles on public roads.
</P>
<P>
   Also perishing in a Senate committee was House Bill 209 by Rep.
Henry Cuellar, D-Laredo, creating a sales tax holiday for the
purchase of school supplies in August. The concept isn't absolutely
dead, however, because Cuellar said he would try to incorporate the
tax break into other tax-relief measures that remain viable.
</P>
<P>
   Even some bills that have made it through one round of approval
in both chambers were in danger of dying over unresolved
differences, including a proposal to allow the Texas Lottery
Commission to increase prizes on scratch-off games.
</P>
<P>
   The lottery proposal, House Bill 844 by Wilson, is hung up on a
dispute over the Senate's demand that lottery advertising be
reduced. A House-Senate negotiating committee has been attempting
to resolve differences since May 12, with a deadline for action of
May 29. The session ends May 31.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson also authored the open-container ban, House Bill 3555,
which was part of a sweeping alcohol regulation measure. House
members amended it to ban minors in bars and to prohibit liquor
sales in sexually oriented businesses, prompting one senator to
``tag'' the bill in committee, delaying its consideration past the
May 14 deadline for Senate committee approval.
</P>
<P>
   The minors in bars proposal also was contained in House Bill 106
by Rep. Leo Alvarado, D-San Antonio, whose free-standing bill was
approved in the House only to perish in a Senate committee Friday.
The same fate was shared by a stand-alone bill banning open
containers in vehicles, House Bill 487 by Rep. Fred Hill,
R-Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Other House-approved bills that hit fatal speedbumps in the
Senate late last week:
</P>
<P>
   _ House Bill 275 by Rep. George ``Buddy'' West, R-Odessa,
limiting prisoners' recreational amenities.
</P>
<P>
   _ House Bill 537 by Rep. Debra Danburg, D-Houston, regulating
telemarketers.
</P>
<P>
   _ House Bill 687 by Rep. Fred Bosse, D-Houston, to make Texans
ages 65-67 eligible for free fishing licenses.
</P>
<P>
   _ House Bill 749 by Rep. Leticia Van de Putte, D-San Antonio,
barring sale of some perishable food and drug items at flea
markets.
</P>
<P>
   _ House Bill 1155 by Rep. Ron Lewis, revising health regulations
for the tanning industry.
</P>
<P>
   _ House Bill 1200 by Rep. Joe Crabb, R-Atascocita, to allow
deannexation elections.
</P>
<P>
   _ House Bill 1708 by Rep. Glen Maxey, D-Austin, creating a
maximum charge of $75 for an unrequested tow.
</P>
<P>
   _ House Bill 1827, by Rep. Scott Hochberg, D-Houston, requiring
driver's licenses to have a space for listing an emergency contact.
</P>
<P>
   _ House Bill 2420 by Rep. Joe Driver, R-Garland, to limit
``junk'' or unsolicited faxes.
</P>
<P>
   _ House Bill 2554 by Rep. Charles Jones, R-College Station,
creating special license plates for members of the Air Force Escape
and Evasion Society.
</P>
<P>
   _ House Bill 3552 by Rep. Helen Giddings, D-Dallas, barring the
Legislature from meeting on MLK Day.

 &HT;    Drug rehab clinic agrees to settlement in fraud suit
 &HT;    By Jenny Staletovich
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A Boca Raton-based drug rehabilitation
clinic that sent patients to see The Fugitive and Thelma and
Louise, then billed the federal government for group therapy or
``adult living skills'' agreed to pay $7.7 million to settle a
lawsuit filed by the U.S. attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   The Tuesday settlement was reached by a trustee for National
Recovery Institutes Group, which filed for bankruptcy in March 1998
and shut its doors.
</P>
<P>
   The case, triggered when a former therapist complained to
supervisors about fraudulent billing, closes another chapter in the
plummeting career of former health care mogul Sheldon Russakoff,
whose late-night television commercials and limousine service
helped build an empire in South Florida. Russakoff, who could not
be reached for comment Tuesday, remains under criminal
investigation for fraudulent billing.
</P>
<P>
   Because the company is in bankruptcy, Joelee Caplan, who is
still a therapist, will only receive about $28,000 for blowing the
whistle on Rusakoff. The federal government will receive only
slightly more.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could call it bittersweet, but remember private citizens
come forward. . . . to expose fraud,'' said her attorney, Ken
Nolan. ``She exposed the fraud, and it was investigated really well
by the (Pentagon's Defense Criminal Investigative Service). As a
result, the defendant chose to file for bankruptcy and go out of
business.''
</P>
<P>
   National Recovery was one of about a dozen companies operated by
Russakoff and helped finance his million-dollar waterfront Boca
Raton villa, a North Miami Beach condo, a Ferrari, a Bentley and
other luxuries.
</P>
<P>
   Russakoff, 54, came to Florida after opening a lucrative rehab
clinic in New York, which came under scrutiny when auditors
discovered he charged up to 17 times what comparable nonprofit
clinics charged. Ultimately auditors demanded he return nearly a
half million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   By 1990, he had expanded his empire to South Florida by
advertising heavily on late night TV to northeasterners happy to
come to sunny South Florida to cure their addictions to alcohol and
other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Russakoff's aggressive marketing _ he paid for airfare and
limousine service for potential patients _ paid off. He had clinics
in Boca Raton and Fort Lauderdale, an HMO in Sunrise and summered
in St. Tropez. Clinic workers, however, said he operated his
clinics like mills and treatment suffered. One patient complained
that after nine days, which included only one or two brief talks
with a psychiatrist, he was billed nearly $13,000. He spent most of
his time watching TV or going to the movies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In its investigation, the Pentagon found records that indicated
the federal government was repeatedly double-billed or billed for
therapy when patients went to the beach or bowling. ``Randolph J.
has weight training which (National Recovery billed) as adult
living skills therapy for $165. . . . Vickie M. attended water
volleyball (billed) . . . as adult living skills therapy for
$125,'' according to records listed in the federal lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, less than a year after she was hired, Caplan refused to
falsify records and complained to supervisors, Nolan said. In April
1996 she was fired and quickly filed her suit, which doubles as a
wrongful termination case and a complaint of fraud on behalf of the
government. Called the qui tam rule, it literally means he who sues
in the name of the king, said assistant U.S. Attorney Laurie
Rucoba, who joined the case in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In its amended complaint, the government claimed Russakoff
bilked $1.6 million from Medicaid and more than $700,000 from
TRICARE, the military insurance plan.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in bankruptcy court, creditors have lined up with
claims against Russakoff's companies worth $50 million, said Robert
Furr, an attorney who represented him. The three clinics in Florida
have all been sold, and the New York clinic is in the process of
being sold, Furr said. The government is an unsecured creditor and
must wait behind secured creditors such as banks.
</P>
<P>
   The government stands to receive little _ for this case, the
trustee set aside only $142,288 minus Caplan's 20 percent cut. But
by working closely with First Union bank officials who were owed
about $8 million, the government helped stop even more loss, Rucoba
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even after filing bankruptcy, the clinics continued to operate
and bill for services, she said. The month before the state took
over Sunrise Health Plan, an HMO with 16,000 members operated by
Russakoff, Russakoff paid himself nearly a half million dollars.
But together the government and bank worked to convince the courts
to appoint a trustee, who fired administrators and stopped the
fraudulent billing, Rucoba said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was our way of stopping the fraud,'' and helping to stop
the drain of assets, she said. ``This was the best result for the
government under the circumstances.''

SEARCH FOR EXTRATERRESTRIAL LIFE GETS A LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Calif.)   (bl)  
 By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NASA on Tuesday gave new prominence to its search
for extraterrestrial life by appointing a Nobel laureate to head
its recently formed Astrobiology Institute, dedicated to studying
the origin, distribution and destiny of life in the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Baruch Blumberg, a biochemist who won the 1976 Nobel Prize
for Physiology or Medicine for identifying the hepatitis B virus,
will become the first director of the institute, which is seeking
new approaches to defining and studying life on Earth and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin, who made the announcement at
the agency's Ames Research Center in California, where the
institute's headquarters will be, said getting Blumberg to head the
effort showed the priority the NASA was giving to finding ``if
there is a thread of life beyond Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldin said the institute, a consortium of experts and
institutions representing government, private industry and
academia, was charged with providing the ``intellectual
underpinnings'' for building new types of instruments and space
probes for finding life in the solar system and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   The institute, which was formed last year, is intended to be an
organization ``without walls,'' whose members do research at their
own institutions and communicate through television conferences and
the Internet. The organization, whose current 11 institutional
members include the University of California at Los Angeles,
Harvard University, the University of Colorado and several NASA
field centers, started with a $10 million budget. Goldin said NASA
had proposed increasing financing to $25 million and hoped
eventually to support the effort with $50 million to $100 million a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Blumberg, who attended a news conference at Ames with Goldin,
said the institute would support a basic science program that
included many disciplines, including astronomy, biology, geology,
chemistry and physics, to search for life in new ways. The program
will not only look at ways to detect carbon-based life, as found on
Earth, but also to come up with ideas to find forms of life that
are very different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really very excited and enthusiastic about taking part in
this program,'' said Blumberg, who is a professor of medicine and
anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania and a senior
researcher at Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia. Blumberg
said he would move to Ames in September.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the institute's job, he said, would be to study life at
its extremes on Earth to help point out where similar forms of life
might exist elsewhere. Simple bacteria have been found in the hot
mouths of volcanoes and in subzero conditions in Antarctica, as
well as near mountaintops and two miles deep in underground rocks,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding how these organisms adapt and evolve under such
conditions will help in developing space probes that might burrow
deep underground to find organisms on Mars, or submarine
instruments to explore possible seas under the icy crusts of
Europa, a large moon of Jupiter, Goldin said.

BOARD ACTION COULD HIKE ONLINE USERS' PHONE COSTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- In a decision that some fear will drive up the cost of
going on line, a split state board is preparing to let Bell
Atlantic off the hook for millions of dollars in fees it pays to
companies that handle a large volume of Internet phone traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said the state Department of Telecommunications and
Energy is expected to side with Bell Atlantic on a 3-2 vote,
although officials Tuesday cautioned that the wording of the
decision has not been completed and changes could still occur.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute revolves around the definition of a local call and,
according to some industry officials, the outcome is likely to
revamp the underlying economics of Internet access by telephone in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they rule that way, I predict rates will go up,'' said
Frank Gangi, president of a Quincy-based company that handles
Internet-bound phone traffic for about 1 million people in
Massachusetts and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Under current rules, Gangi's company, Global NAPs, receives
about $1 million a month in so-called reciprocal compensation fees
from Bell Atlantic for helping to handle the Internet-bound phone
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   If state regulators side with Bell Atlantic, those fees will dry
up and Gangi says he will be forced to hike the prices he charges
Internet service providers. Those providers, he says, will be
forced to increase the rates they charge their customers or pull
out of some markets entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Every day across the state, consumers dial local phone numbers
to gain access to the Internet. Right now, many of those calls are
carried initially by Bell Atlantic to a competing phone company,
like Global NAPs, which then routes the calls to an Internet
service provider that connects the customer to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Under contracts Bell Atlantic has with these competing phone
companies, it is required to charge its customer for the call and
use a portion of the money it collects to compensate its competitor
for completing the call.
</P>
<P>
   But Bell Atlantic is required to pay the compensation only if
the call is local. The question facing the Department of
Telecommunications and Energy is whether a call that ends up on the
Internet is truly local.
</P>
<P>
   In October, the DTE ruled that the Internet connections were
local and that Bell Atlantic should pay the reciprocal compensation
fees, which average about a penny a minute.
</P>
<P>
   In February, however, the Federal Communications Commission held
that the calls were long distance but left it up to individual
states to decide whether the current compensation arrangement
should be changed. The FCC said it planned to come up with a new
compensation arrangement sometime in the future.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the FCC decision, state regulators here began
studying the issue again. In the meantime, Bell Atlantic was
ordered to place the bulk of its payments in escrow pending the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   According to sources, the soon-to-be-released state decision
will hold that the calls are not local and that Bell Atlantic is
not required to make the payments. The decision is also expected to
allow Bell Atlantic to recover the funds in escrow.
</P>
<P>
   As of Tuesday, sources said the DTE majority consisted of Paul
Vasington, James Connelly, and Robert Keating. Those opposed to the
ruling were chairman Janet Gail Besser and Eugene Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time the five-member board has split on any
issue, although the sources said the board was in general agreement
on most of the fundamental issues.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the dissenters apparently have agreed that the
calls are not local but argue Bell Atlantic should continue to
escrow the fees while the agency launches a formal inquiry into how
the competing phone companies should be compensated.
</P>
<P>
   That way, Bell Atlantic and its competitors would both have an
incentive to reach a settlement on the payment issue.
</P>
<P>
   A Bell Atlantic spokesman said Tuesday the company had heard
nothing from DTE. Earlier, Bell Atlantic said that, if it did not
prevail, it would seek to recover the cost of the fees in its rates
from all of its customers, not just those seeking Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic officials said it would make as much as $150
million in reciprocal compensation payments this year.
</P>
<P>
   Gangi, who said he had heard nothing official from DTE, said a
ruling in favor of Bell Atlantic would run counter to what other
states have done. He said 10 other states have ruled on this issue
and in each case the state has decided that the reciprocal
compensation fees should continue.

 &HT;    White House muscle behind Everglades plan
 &HT;    By Robert P. King
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla. _ Armed with the nation's biggest environmental
restoration proposal and its most complex plan for rescuing
imperiled species, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt pledged Tuesday
that the White House will crusade for the Everglades on Capitol
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are out there at the very frontier of science and
restoration,'' Babbitt told more than 300 scientists, engineers,
activists and government leaders. Then he signed a plan aimed at
saving 68 species in South and Central Florida _ ranging from
Florida's state animal, the panther, to plants such as the papery
whitlow-wort.
</P>
<P>
   The species plan, plus a $7.8 billion Everglades restoration
proposal set to go to Congress in July, are the bulwark of the
Clinton administration's efforts to rescue South Florida's
environment. Both are a dramatic break from decades of failed
attempts to protect species and habitats one at a time, Babbitt
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not pulling any cookbooks off the shelf,'' he added.
``We are doing something brand-new.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd applauded. But afterward, some asked questions:
</P>
<P>
   Where, in the species plan's 2,000 pages, are the teeth needed
to save the species' habitat from development?
</P>
<P>
   Where is the panel of national experts who are supposed to
review the $7.8 billion proposal _ a promise Babbitt made earlier
this year to soothe some skeptical scientists?
</P>
<P>
   How can the government's grand plans succeed when disagreements
among federal agencies have stalled some modest Everglades projects
for years?
</P>
<P>
   The species plan, which has no cost estimate, contains
information on endangered plants, animals and habitat in 19
counties. Local planners can use the data to find ways to protect
the species _ or at least to avoid running afoul of the Endangered
Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of even one species usually masks a deeper problem,
Babbitt said _ the demise of a complex web of plants and animals
that can affect the way people enjoy the outdoors, even their whole
quality of life.

TAX REPEAL UNDERSCORES SILVER'S BALANCING ACT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ For five years as the speaker of the state
Assembly, Sheldon Silver has struggled, often against a torrent of
Republican criticism, to deliver this message: His Democrats are
not the party of taxes, and are not solely the party of New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's vote to repeal the commuter tax in New York, a levy
on suburbanites who work in the city, Silver saw a perfect
opportunity to put some muscle behind the message. Lawmakers in
both parties expected the speaker to play his most enduring role,
defender of the city's interests, and block the repeal. Instead, he
embraced it, and the repeal passed.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday, Silver happily conceded that the
politics of the Assembly's 98-member Democratic conference had
shaped his strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it important for us to stand up and say, `We're not
only about the city, we're about the suburbs, and about upstate as
well,''' he said. ``We had 19 suburban members who needed this.
They needed it for their political advancement. And we in the city
needed them satisfied so they could spend another day supporting
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue illustrated the daily balancing act that Silver's job
entails. He must weigh the interests of city, suburban and upstate
Assembly members against one another; find an equilibrium among the
aims of liberals, moderates and conservatives, and choose between
heartfelt views and more politically expedient positions.
</P>
<P>
   He holds together the fractious Democratic conference that hails
mostly from New York City, while standing up for the city at a time
when New York has a Republican governor and a Republican-controlled
state Senate with few urban allegiances.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the speaker came down on the side of protecting
suburban Democrats whose constituents pay the tax, rather than the
city. That decision will cost the city up to $360 million a year in
revenue, but it was made more palatable by the city's $2 billion
budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Silver's call drew loud protests from some city Democrats and
from New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was, in terms of the city, a very big hit, and I think we
could have at least demanded something in return,'' said
Assemblywoman Deborah Glick, a Manhattan Democrat who voted against
the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said Tuesday that the issue would force him to alter a
budget that included significant tax cuts. ``What we'll also have
to do, probably, is delay the tax cuts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for those who voted for the bill, ``I can't believe it isn't
going to be an issue, unless they are so safe and so secure that
their constituents don't care if they're voting against their
interests,'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   The famously tight-lipped Silver was more secretive than usual
this time, announcing his decision to reporters last week without
first consulting or warning his colleagues. That left some New York
City Democrats fuming that he had not only hurt the city, but had
slighted them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would have been better if there was more time to
discuss the issue,'' said Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz, a Bronx
Democrat who voted against the repeal.
</P>
<P>
   But even his critics on this issue conceded that Silver has been
a steadfast protector of the city, particularly against budget cuts
proposed by Gov. George Pataki. The speaker insured that the
property tax program being phased in around the state includes a
cut in the city income tax. The pre-kindergarten and class-size
reduction programs he pushed into law directed more than half the
money to the city. And in perhaps his most triumphant moment, he
beat back a Republican attempt to undo rent regulations two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   City Democrats, particularly the Assembly's more liberal
members, often complain that Silver is too driven by concern for
the ``marginals'' _ members from suburban and upstate swing
districts who cannot afford to be perceived as liberal or beholden
to the city. Some city Democrats said the commuter tax was a
particularly egregious example, in that it directly harmed the
city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm all for helping somebody else in the conference, but I
don't want to get hurt at the same time,'' Dinowitz said. ``Is the
mayor now going to cut services? Is he going to eliminate some of
the tax cuts? Either way, my constituents suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   But many Democrats Tuesday insisted that Silver has made the
regional partnership a fairly equal one, and that this was one
issue Democrats could not afford to cede.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have fallen into the Republicans' trap and gone against
this would have been politically catastrophic,'' said Assemblyman
Richard Brodsky, a Westchester County Democrat who advocated
repealing the tax. ``He who controls the suburbs controls the
state. Shelly knows that.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver said Tuesday that there was never much question that he
would approve the repeal, and quickly. It was important, he said,
``to show we are a statewide conference, and that they are not
going to paint us into a profile that they want us to be in, which
is, `Don't worry, Shelly will pick up the city.'''

HARVARD OUSTER LINKED TO PORN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAMES BANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The dean of Harvard Divinity School was forced to resign last
fall after thousands of pornographic images were found on his
Harvard-owned personal computer, university sources said this week.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard asked for Ronald F. Thiemann's resignation shortly after
the matter was brought to the attention of president Neil L.
Rudenstine. He was asked to resign his position ``for conduct
unbecoming a dean,'' the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last fall, information was brought to President Rudenstine's
attention bearing on Dean Thiemann's continued capacity to serve as
dean,'' said Joe Wrinn, a university spokesman. ``President
Rudenstine met immediately with Dean Thiemann. They agreed that it
would be in the best interests of the Divinity School for the dean
to resign.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his resignation, Thiemann did not publicly
disclose the specific reasons for his sudden departure. Thiemann,
who has taken a year sabbatical, remains a tenured faculty member.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on what we knew, the university did not initiate tenure
revocation proceedings,'' Wrinn said, adding that Harvard would
have no further comment on the matter, which he described as a
confidential personnel issue.
</P>
<P>
   Thiemann's lawyer, Charles Ogletree, a professor at Harvard Law
School, said Thiemann would not respond to ``anonymous
allegations,'' but would issue a statement later in the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The measure of a man like Ron Thiemann cannot be determined in
response to allegations such as these but in the context of the
admiration and respect he has gained from colleagues at the
university, in the theological community and the secular
community,'' Ogletree said.
</P>
<P>
   Ogletree said the decision of Thiemann to step down was a
``mutually agreed upon decision and there were a number of factors
beyond those alleged that influenced his decision.''
</P>
<P>
   While not speaking about this particular case, Ogletree added:
``Any time there is a question of an employer pursuing the private
life of employees it raises some large constitutional issues, and
the public debate on this is necessarily a vigorous and hotly
contested one.''
</P>
<P>
   The pornographic material was found last fall on Thiemann's
office computer at his Harvard-owned residence at Jewett House. The
discovery was made after Thiemann requested more disk space for one
of his Harvard-owned machines, which was full, according to
university sources. Thiemann was caught after he asked the computer
department to transfer the pornographic files to the new disk
drive, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals familiar with the proceedings described the material
as explicit pornography, but said they believed the incident did
not involve child pornography or other illegal activity.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the discovery ended Thiemann's nearly 13-year
deanship at the Divinity School.
</P>
<P>
   By the accounts of most colleagues, Thiemann's tenure was
extraordinarily productive, marked by the acquisition of a slew of
world class scholars and a successful capital campaign for the
Divinity School. One of Thiemann's most recent accomplishments,
faculty members say, was the creation of the Divinity School's
Center for the Study of Values in Public Life, which is designed to
engage discussion of values in fields such as law, journalism,
business, and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Thiemann's colleagues said they worried about the effect that
the scandal would have on the Divinity School's reputation.
``There's the potential for tremendous damage to the school,'' said
a source at Harvard. ``If this were a business school dean, people
might say, `Big deal.' But take a look at what this guy's area of
research is: It's values. That makes it all the more shocking.''
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Thiemann surprised faculty when he announced at a
special meeting that he was stepping down as dean. ``I had the
impression a few days before that he was not himself,'' said a
faculty member who was there.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting, Thiemann told the faculty that he was resigning
because of medical problems, according to faculty members.
</P>
<P>
   ``He explained he had been suffering depression for some time
and had been trying to deal with it,'' said William Hutchison,
professor of the history of religion in America. ``He said that
he'd been ordered or strongly advised by his doctor to go on leave,
to resign from the deanship and return as a teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   Rumors about the reasons for Thiemann's departure have been
swirling for months at the Divinity School, where there is debate
about the boundary lines between public and private conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the issue is one of privacy,'' said a Harvard Divinity
School graduate who asked to remain anonymous. ``Is the dean's
computer in his home his own? Or because his home and computer are
owned by Harvard, is his whole life owned by the Divinity School?''
</P>
<P>
   Others questioned whether the use of pornography on
Harvard-owned equipment constituted a grave enough offense to
justify the forced resignation of a dean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if these allegations concerning pornography were true _
and I have no knowledge that they are _ I question whether someone
would be dismissed on those grounds,'' said Hutchison.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I guess it would depend on the details. As you know,
that's where the devil is.''

HARTFORD POLICE CHIEF SAYS RACISM ON THE FORCE MUST END 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ With racial tensions rising after the fatal
shooting last month of a black teen-ager by a white police officer,
the Hartford police chief announced Tuesday that he had become
convinced that his force was infected with racism.
</P>
<P>
   He urged white officers to take steps to change their mind-set,
suggesting that they refuse to attend social gatherings unless
black or Hispanic people were present.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Joseph F. Croughwell Jr., who is white, acknowledged that
his statements might be considered tardy. But he said his
department would have to repair its own problems before it could
hope for better relations with black and Hispanic residents, many
of whom have complained that they fear and resent the police since
last month's shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not stand for a continuation of racism within this
department,'' he said. ``I don't think we're at the point where
we're going to die from a cancer, but if we don't remove it and we
don't take care of it, we certainly could.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief, who had not made a public statement since the day the
boy, Aquan Salmon, 14, was shot, said he reached this conclusion
after an emotional presentation last week by several black
ministers who had counseled minority group officers in the
predominantly white police department.
</P>
<P>
   The ministers told him, he said, that the force's two black
commanders had endured racial bias from subordinates. He added
``there were totally false, factless, baseless rumors being passed
throughout the department about the actions'' of one of the two
commanders. The other 10 commanders are white.
</P>
<P>
   He said other black supervisors felt that their orders were
being disobeyed because of their race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want everybody to start thinking about what they may do,
including myself, to perpetuate a perception or an attitude that's
racist,'' Croughwell said. ``For example, let us not go to a social
gathering unless we know that there are going to be people of color
at that social gathering. Let us start thinking about some of the
things we do, some of the things we say. I think that's a first
step.'' He had no other suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   The chief's extraordinary admission won praise from some
community leaders, but vindicated those whose complaints about his
department have been greeted with silence for the last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality of the situation, I believe, has hit him flat in
the face,'' said Larry Charles, the executive director of One Chane
Inc., a neighborhood group. ``The ugliness of his department is now
fully exposed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Nora Wyatt Jr., a rally organizer, said: ``Right now
this community is tense. This community is on edge. And anything
that the chief can do to make it whole should help.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Stewart, the executive director of the National Organization
of Black Law Enforcement Executives, said the chief's directive was
unusual, since most departments resist dealing with racial problems
unless forced to. Such problems have got increasing attention since
the death of Amadou Diallo in New York and the admission by New
Jersey officials that state troopers have singled out
minority-group motorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``A wake-up call like that is usually only in response to a
civil suit or the Department of Justice trying to put a consent
decree on you,'' Stewart said. ``It's a gutsy move.''
</P>
<P>
   Although 68 percent of Hartford's 135,000 residents are black or
Hispanic, 63 percent of the 471 police officers are white. Since
Aquan was shot in the back on April 13, black leaders have held
continual protests, counseling meetings and strategy sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Robert Allan, who shot the boy, has said he thought
Aquan was reaching for a gun. A gun-shaped cigarette lighter was
found nearby.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, Gov. John Rowland went to a Hartford church to
face questions from Aquan's neighbors and relatives. They said they
were still angry about the boy's death, and feared that the
investigation into the shooting would not produce a just result.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland had ordered the state police to take over the
investigation after the Hartford police failed to ask the state
police to step in, as other departments have when an officer was
involved in a controversial shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The department is also undergoing a corruption investigation by
federal prosecutors. The week before Aquan's shooting, four current
and former Hartford officers were indicted on charges that they had
been part of a scheme to use the threat of arrest to extort sexual
favors from prostitutes. Prosecutors expect to bring additional
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Croughwell said he had also been told that members of a group of
black and Hispanic officers, the Hartford Guardians, had been
treated with prejudice by white officers. He said the incidents
were under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   STORY CAN HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Cornell Lewis, a black leader who appeared with the
chief at a news conference Tuesday morning, said later that a
typical incident involved a white officer who would walk past a
black supervisor to whom he should turn in a report, and give it to
a white supervisor instead.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis asserted that Croughwell himself was involved in a similar
incident. Lewis said he had been told that a white officer had
received an assignment he did not want from one of the two black
commanders, Deborah Barrows, the assistant chief for patrol
operations. The white officer is said to have had the order
overturned after a call was placed on his behalf to Croughwell, who
was in California.
</P>
<P>
   Croughwell denied countermanding the assistant chief's order.
Chief Barrows appeared with him Tuesday, along with the
department's other ranking black official, James Berry, the deputy
chief for the North End. That section is one of three police
divisions in the city and the one where Aquan lived.

$70M PATRIOTS STADIUM FUNDING BILL STAGGERS TO PASSAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The four-year political battle over funding for a New
England Patriots stadium reached its dramatic denouement Tuesday
when the Legislature passed a $70 million bill that Governor Paul
Cellucci said he would sign next week.
</P>
<P>
   But even on a day when it looked like the skids had been well
greased for final approval, the measure hit what could have been a
fatal snag.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-hour ordeal began when the House approved the bill,
but only after changing the legislation in a way that could have
jeopardized the crucial 2001 timeframe for completing a $225
million privately financed replacement for Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the bill was restored to its original intent, but
not before sending a scare through both branches.
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Thomas F. Birmingham, stunned by the day's
events, said the stadium issue has been ``like riding a roller
coaster being strapped in backwards.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, after the Senate approved the bill without debate 36-1,
the Chelsea Democrat added: ``All's well that ends well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots declined to comment, saying they still have not
read the legislation authorizing $70 million for road, sewer and,
other infrastructure improvements along Route 1. In return, the
team would pay the state $1 million a year, and satellite parking
lots must pay the state $400,000 annually.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran smiled when it was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long, long, saga in Massachusetts,'' the Mattapan
Democrat said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, out of concern for a trailer park on land
where the new facility is planned, the House deleted language that
would have forced dozens of residents to relocate within 180 days,
instead giving them two years. Kraft owns the land and will need it
cleared to make way for the open-air stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives also refused language that would have rushed an
environmental review so the facility could be built by 2001.
Another amendment was thrown in requiring the team to study moving
its Smithfield, R.I., pre-season training camp to Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   But Birmingham, mystified over the last-minute changes to a bill
that leaders of both branches had already agreed upon after intense
negotiation, called the revisions ``fatal'' and refused to adopt
them. The Senate passed the measure without the House changes, and
pressured Finneran to restore the bill to its original form.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reached out to the speaker because I recognized these
amendments put the entire Patriots agreement in peril,'' Birmingham
said. The House gave in, and passed the bill 123-23.
</P>
<P>
   The original debate in the House spanned three hours, during
which there was plenty of rhetorical hyperbole.
</P>
<P>
   One representative implied the Patriots had the cultural
significance of Paul Revere and Plymouth Rock. There were also
statements of support for practical reasons. Repesentative Barbara
Hyland, a Foxborough Republican, said the measure would actually
improve sewer and water problems in the town of 15,000.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the compelling monologue delivered by
Finneran on the floor of the House, which, over the years, has
voted on a handful of different stadium proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Finneran's hard-line stance against the state buying
land around Foxboro Stadium brought legislative action to a halt
and nearly pushed the Patriots into the arms of Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker -- whose sharp comments about Kraft in the past led
some to believe there was personal animosity between the two --
issued a lengthy screed about society's skewed priorities, about
principles and precedents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The members of this House have been maligned in an
extraordinary way, for doing what I think is appropriate,''
Finneran said emphatically. ``We have to manage in a prudent and
responsible way other people's money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, in the final analysis, it's a very positive
conclusion to a long, long, torturous debate that has affected the
deliberation of this chamber in many, many matters,'' Finneran
said.
</P>
<P>
   Members gave him a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   But Representative Christopher Hodgkins, a Lee Democrat,
punctured the serious tone in the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you kidding me?'' Hodgkins said, springing to his feet.
``We're talking like this issue is a big moral issue?...This is
nothing but the big boys in the back rooms making the deals with
professional sports.''

ROBERT L. TURNER DIES AT 89; HELPED CREATE EASTERN SHUTTLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert L. Turner, who pushed Eastern Air Lines to create its
shuttle between Boston and New York in 1961, died on Saturday in
Columbus, N.C. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   He had suffered a series of strokes in recent months, according
to his son.
</P>
<P>
   Turner had a lifelong fascination with flying that included
stints as a pilot, airport owner and airline executive. A native of
Torquay, England, he moved to North Carolina as a teen-ager and by
his mid-20s was operating Turner Flying Services, a hangar and a
runway in Asheville, N.C., that constituted the first airport in
that mountainous resort area. In his spare time, he could be found
in the cockpit of his Waco biplane, barnstorming the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   When the Depression arrived, Turner had to give up flying. He
took a job in 1934 with Eastern, working as a ticket agent on the
night shift in Atlanta. He joined the Air Transport Command during
World War II, helping to coordinate transportation for troops and
world leaders in the Middle East and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, he joined Northeast Airlines, rising to vice president.
In 1957, he left to become an executive with the Air Transport
Association, where he battled on behalf of airlines, favoring a $3
fine for people who were ``no shows'' and eventually was named
president.
</P>
<P>
   He rejoined Eastern in 1959, said his son, Robert L. Turner Jr.
of Milton, Mass. Two years later, Eastern introduced its shuttle
service, which was radical in several ways. Passengers were
guaranteed seats, and no reservations were required. Anyone who
showed up for a flight was to be given one, even if it meant
wheeling out an extra plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was fascinated with that route because it was so heavily
traveled, and he kept saying, `Let's see what's best for the
customer,''' his son said.
</P>
<P>
   Another aspect of the shuttle was its low fare, which Turner and
Eastern's president, Malcolm A. MacIntyre, hoped would encourage
more people to fly to expand the market for air travel, his son
said. ``In those days, there was a great portion of the population
who had never flown at all,'' he said, ``and his feeling was that
if you run a service like this and get a lot of people flying on
short hops, then they'll fly to Los Angeles or Miami.'' Within a
year, the shuttle was considered a success.
</P>
<P>
   Turner retired from Eastern in 1969 but was soon busy leasing
jets in an arrangement he conceived, his son said. ``He knew that
Eastern had this tremendous crush of demand in the wintertime
because of the Florida routes, and not so much demand in the
summertime,'' his son said. ``He thought it was silly for airlines
to spend all this money on airplanes they weren't using all the
time. So he and this financial partner got two insurance companies
to put up the money, and they bought two Lockheed L-1011's. They
were used by Eastern in the winter and Air Canada in the summer.
For 15 years, these two airplanes got a new paint job every six
months and went to work for the other airline.'' Such arrangements
subsequently became commonplace in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Turner, a former resident of Darien, Conn., moved to Tryon,
N.C., several years ago and spent winters on Sanibel Island, Fla.
In Sanibel, an area famous for beachcombing, he listened to
old-timers complaining that many of the best seashells were gone
for good, and came up with another idea that has yet to be
realized, his son said. ``He said: `Why not have the Chamber of
Commerce put up a few bucks and grow some junonias and some lemon
pectins and some Chinese alphabet cones? You could grow them in a
colony in captivity and toss them out into the gulf and it'd be
great for tourism.'''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his son, he is survived by his wife, Margaret; a
daughter, Louisa Turner of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.

U.S. UNVEILS PLAN TO AID 68 SPECIES IN EVERGLADES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla. _ Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt Tuesday
unveiled an ambitious plan to save more than 68 endangered and
threatened species in South Florida, taking a regional approach to
disappearing wildlife that the Clinton administration hopes will
become a national model.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to a forum of scientists involved in the restoration of
Florida Everglades, Babbitt called the plan ``an unprecedented,
pioneering effort.''
</P>
<P>
   The 2,400-page document, which looks a bit like a wildlife
encyclopedia, lays out a blueprint for restoring natural habitat
across 26,000 square miles in southern Florida, and saving dozens
of threatened species, including the manatee, the American
crocodile and plants like Small's milkpea and the deltoid splurge.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt said the government's hope was to depart from the
piecemeal approach of adopting harsh legal tactics to save each
species as it nears extinction, sometimes to the detriment of other
species and often at the cost of economic development.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have learned is you can't do these issues one species
at a time,'' Babbitt said. ``That's the significance of this plan
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, federal authorities would work with developers
and local governments to reach agreements on setting aside habitats
for endangered species before construction projects get under way,
rather than suing them to stop projects after they are started. In
most cases, the developers would then be released from the
obligation to protect endangered species on the land designated for
development.
</P>
<P>
   Federal wildlife officials said the idea was to shape
development in a way that sets aside and preserves habitats for all
species, rather than fighting politically divisive battles in court
over a single bird or fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we are doing it right this time,'' Babbitt said.
``We are putting it up on the front end. We're not going to sit
back and take the dog-in-the-manger stance, saying you go and do
your thing and then let us say, `No!'''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials have tried similar tactics with considerable
success in the old-growth forests of the Pacific Northwest and
along the coastal sage lands of Southern California. But Babbitt
said the Florida plan was the largest initiative of its kind ever
tried, and the first to deal with a vast aquatic ecosystem like the
Everglades and Florida Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The health of the Everglades has been deteriorating for decades.
The flood control system the Army built in the 1950s drained
thousands of acres for farmland, splintered the marsh prairies with
dikes and canals, and severed the wetlands in the south from Lake
Okeechobee, thus stopping the slow, shallow flow of water that was
the lifeblood of the system.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's announcement comes as Congress is preparing to debate
a $7.8 billion public works project this summer aimed at restoring
the Everglades to ecological health. That project, known as the
``Restudy,'' involves building dozens of large reservoirs, both
above and below ground, and revamping the canals and dikes to
restore the natural flow of water to the wetlands and into Florida
Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Some conservationists said the public works projects going to
Congress in July would be much more important to stopping the
decline of threatened species than Babbitt's plan. Unless the
erratic flow of water into the Everglades can be fixed, there is
little hope many of the endangered species will make it.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Lee of the Florida Audubon Society, said, ``If we can't
put the water back in the Everglades, and we are not able to
re-establish the natural flow of water, then the steps recommended
in the recovery plan are not going to be sufficient.''
</P>
<P>
   But other ecologists said Babbitt's approach marks a
breakthrough in environmental policy. In the past, they said,
conservationists had been forced to sue to protect a single species
under the Endangered Species Act in order to save the larger
ecosystem. Naturalists championed the survival of the spotted owl,
for instance, to protect the old growth forests of the Northwest,
and the fight over the lowly snail darter was in reality a battle
over the future of the Little Tennessee River.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear precisely how the wildlife recovery plan will
be implemented as the state and federal governments move ahead with
the larger effort to restore the Everglades. Several projects aimed
at restoring the habitat in the marshes have become bogged down for
years in local political battles and disagreements among federal
agencies.

DAIMLERCHRYSLER'S SMART CAR IS LONE SORE SPOT AT MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ The snub-nosed Smart can turn on a dime,
squeeze into half-sized parking spaces and switch from manual to
automatic transmission at the push of a button.
</P>
<P>
   But eight months after its introduction, the little car known
informally as the ``Swatchmobile'' has become a billion-dollar
headache for its parent company, DaimlerChrysler AG.
</P>
<P>
   Developed as a radical new concept for an automobile, a two-seat
``city car'' that would be safe and maneuverable and spacious on
the inside, the Smart has run into a slew of problems.
</P>
<P>
   First, DaimlerChrysler was forced to delay its introduction for
about six months while it fixed a number of technical problems.
Then customers complained that the cars slid out of control on snow
and ice. Sales plunged to 10,000 in the first three months of this
year from 30,000 vehicles in the last quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, as DaimlerChrysler held its first annual shareholders
meeting since the merger of Daimler-Benz and Chrysler Corp., the
Smart was one of the company's few sore spots.
</P>
<P>
   The newly merged company has enjoyed fairly solid growth among
both the Chrysler and Mercedes-Benz lines. Sales climbed 9 percent,
to $49.3 billion in the first four months of this year, and
Mercedes sales jumped 14 percent. Company officials predicted at
the annual meeting Tuesday that 1999 sales would total $148
billion, up from earlier forecasts of $145 billion.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler executives could also boast Tuesday that they
have successfully moved beyond their traditional lineup of
high-priced conservative sedans. The Mercedes M-Class sport utility
trucks have been a huge hit in the United States and in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Even the A-Class four-seater subcompact, which encountered a
torrent of problems in late 1997 after independent test-drivers
flipped it during a maneuver known as the ``moose test,'' is now
selling briskly. Analysts predict sales of the A-Class will reach
180,000 cars this year, up from 136,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
   But the Smart is having considerably more difficulty. Initially
conceived by Nicholas Hayek, founder of the Swatch watch company,
Smart was supposed to be a more radical break with the past.
DaimlerChrysler formed a new company with Hayek, the Micro Compact
Car GmbH, and financed a new factory in France as well as a
separate set of dealerships.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler executives had initially planned on selling at
least 130,000 cars this year, but it now seems doubtful they will
sell 100,000. Company executives have also said Smart must sell at
least 80,000 vehicles before they can invest in developing new
models.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the Smart's problem is its apparent instability in snow
and ice. Beginning late last year, customers complained that cars,
which have a rear-mounted engine and a rear-wheel drive, had a
dangerous tendency to oversteer.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler responded by installing a computer-controlled
anti-skidding system, which has received favorable reviews in
several car magazines.
</P>
<P>
   But industry analysts say Smart's biggest problem is that it
costs too much and delivers too little. The most basic model costs
about 16,000 German marks, or about $8,800. For that price,
consumers can also pick several four-seat cars like the Ford Ka or
the Renault Clio.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is whether there are really that many people who
want a two-seater car just for the purpose of having inner-city
mobility,'' said Christian Breitsprecher, an automobile analyst at
Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   To a great extent, DaimlerChrysler initially marketed the car as
an expression of life style _ a car that was irreverent,
innovative, hip and environmentally friendly.
</P>
<P>
   Now it has shifted strategy. It began a big new advertising
campaign emphasizing practical issues like maneuverability and
storage space. It also extended the list of standard equipment to
include radios and extra padding. It cut the price by several
hundred dollars.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler co-chairman Robert Eaton insisted Tuesday that
it was still loyal to the Smart.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Smart is one of the most innovative cars on the market,''
he said at the annual meeting Tuesday in Stuttgart. Daimler's
recent measures to correct weaknesses, he said, would provide the
conditions to ``give the Smart a new chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Company officials did not disclose Smart's sales in April,
except to say that they had increased significantly over those in
the first three months of the year. ``The clear increase in orders
confirms our optimism,'' said Juergen Schrempp, DaimlerChrysler's
other co-chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Several German publications have reported that Schrempp has
vowed to cut back Daimler's investment in new Smart models if it
fails to improve its sales in the next six months.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the Smart becomes particularly costly if its
production remains below 100,000 units a year. The reason is that
DaimlerChrysler guaranteed many parts suppliers an annual
production volume of about 100,000 units to get them to set up near
the Smart factory in Hambach, France.

PORTER W. HEAPS, 92, MUSICIAN WHO MADE AN ORGAN SOUND BIG 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Porter Warrington Heaps, an organist and composer whose work on
the popular Hammond organ transformed a crude-sounding electronic
keyboard instrument into one that could approximate the sounds and
colors of larger pipe organs, died on May 3 at his home in Palo
Alto, Calif. He was 92.
</P>
<P>
   Heaps was born in Cicero, Ill., in 1906. He showed an early
aptitude for the piano and organ, and was hired for his first job
as a church organist when he was still in grammar school. In the
1920s he received bachelor's and master's degrees in music from
Northwestern University. He also studied with the organist and
composer Marcel Dupre in Paris during the summers.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1930s, Heaps taught the organ at Northwestern
University, where he was also the chapel organist, and at the
Cosmopolitan School of Music and Dramatic Art, in Chicago. He also
began a 40-year association with the Hammond organ company. By the
mid-1930s he had found ways to make the instrument's registrations
_ the timbres created when an organist uses different stops and
combinations of stops _ sound richer and more realistic.
</P>
<P>
   He demonstrated his achievement in a competition, held over the
initial protests of the American Guild of Organists, in which his
reconfigured Hammond organ performed side by side with a pipe organ
at a large chapel. A panel of three judges was unable to agree on
which instrument was the Hammond.
</P>
<P>
   Thereafter, Heaps toured the country for Hammond, giving
seminars and demonstration concerts. He was intent on popularizing
the instrument and set up his own company, Keyboard Publications,
which published his compositions, arrangements and teaching
materials.
</P>
<P>
   After his retirement from Hammond in 1970, Heaps moved to Palo
Alto, where he continued to give recitals and demonstrations on
both electronic and pipe organs, and annual performances at the
Home Organ Festival in Asilomar, Calif. He was also the organist
and music director of the Palo Alto Community Church.
</P>
<P>
   Heaps is survived by two daughters, Barbara Van Slyke of
Stanford, Calif., and Portia Leet of Palo Alto; five grandchildren,
and six great-grandchildren.

O'NEAL CERTAIN HE WON'T HAVE SECOND BAD GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Outside, a thunderstorm battered the Alamodome on
Monday night, while inside, the San Antonio Spurs somehow bottled
up a human tornado. But the Los Angeles Lakers felt no chill in the
aftermath, wrapping themselves in the warmest of security blankets
_ the knowledge that Shaquille O'Neal can't be bottled for long.
</P>
<P>
   As O'Neal himself noted last week, after making 9 of 22 shots in
a loss to Houston, he never has two bad games in a row. He bounced
back with a 37-point game.
</P>
<P>
   So as the Lakers stare at their first series deficit of the
postseason, 0-1 to the Spurs, they exude a confidence that borders
on cockiness. They know things will be different in Game 2 at the
Alamodome tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's gonna be fine,'' coach Kurt Rambis said of O'Neal.
``We're going to show him the tape, show him what they're doing,
and we're going to put the players in different scenarios so (the
Spurs) are not going to be able just lock into him as easy....
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he's going to play better. There's no doubt in my mind
about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Either by scoring or by passing. That's the typical double-edged
sword of double- and triple-teaming O'Neal, who averaged 4.0
assists in the 3-1 series victory over Houston. But finding the
open shooter just got tougher, by about 14 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs alternately send combos of Tim Duncan, David Robinson
and Will Perdue _ 7 feet each _ at O'Neal, then mix it up with a
digging guard here and there.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have two 7-footers coming at you,'' said Glen Rice,
``the only way you can see people is if you're on the ground and
trying to roll the ball out.''
</P>
<P>
   Short of that strategy, the Lakers will try to get O'Neal to
make his move sooner, passing or going to the hoop before his sight
lines become 1-inch slits between black-and-white jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you beat one 7-footer you've still got to face another
7-footer. That's a tough proposition for anybody,'' Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Noted Robert Horry: ``When they stretch out, that's 10 feet of
space they're taking up. He's just got to do something to get those
guys out of the way to give him more room.''
</P>
<P>
   It will help, too, if the Lakers' perimeter players fulfill
their responsibilities. Too often Monday, they reverted to standing
and watching after feeding the ball to O'Neal. And when they were
available for a kick-out, they were missing shots, hitting 38
percent of their field-goal attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that shouldn't be surprising. The Spurs were No.1 in the
NBA this year in field-goal percentage allowed (.402) and third in
points allowed (84.7).
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to do a much better job at not being predictable with
what we're doing,'' Rambis said. ``We played so well whenever we
weren't predictable, even in (Monday's) game. But any time we
locked in and sent up a red flag _ `this is what were running' _
they knew exactly how they were gonna double-team and exactly what
they were gonna do. So we just have to do a much better job at
moving the basketball and not being predictable.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've just become a real nice defensive team. The outside
players trust that their back is gonna be covered, so they get out
and pressure and harass, and they know that Robinson and Duncan are
gonna clog up the paint.''
</P>
<P>
   And contain O'Neal's spins to the hoop, his so-called ``Black
Tornado'' move.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal was certainly hacked more often than whistles blew, and
his frustration showed when he committed his second, third and
fourth fouls in two minutes of the third quarter. His fourth was a
dropped hammer that sent Duncan to the floor and earned O'Neal a
flagrant foul.
</P>
<P>
   A day after verbally accosting referee Steve Javie, then
reportedly smashing a VCR in the locker room, O'Neal calmly vowed
to adjust his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to guard Shaq is to break the rules that the NBA
is supposed to enforce, but they're not enforcing them,'' he said.
``I'll just have to play a little bit smarter myself.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, O'Neal doesn't play two bad games in a row. Even the
Spurs know better than to assume otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect every game to go like we planned,'' Robinson said,
``but that's what makes him an All-Star, he can come back any night
and have a good game. It's just one game. There's no trend that's
started yet.''

U. OF CHICAGO STUDENTS ON SCAVENGER HUNT TO SHARPEN MINDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANDREW BLUTH    c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ ``People think of the University of Chicago and they
think the students are weird,'' says Tom Howe, a junior from
Atlanta. Having taken off his chicken suit, he is wearing a
cardboard crown from a Burger King Kid's Meal. ``We want to show
that intellectual doesn't necessarily mean stuffy.''
</P>
<P>
   It is this philosophy _ that Chicago students can have fun if
they really put their minds to it _ that gave birth to the
University of Chicago Scavenger Hunt, a yearly celebration of
looniness at a campus far better known for its Nobel laureates.
</P>
<P>
   Putting aside term papers for a long weekend, hundreds of
undergraduates in teams representing dormitories and student
organizations range around the campus _ and, this year, the North
American continent _ in search of items that will never be found in
a course catalog. The grand prize is $500, but the goal, says Howe,
is loftier: ``to make the participants maximize their intellectual
creativity.''
</P>
<P>
   These were among the 339 items on the list for this year's
scavenger hunt, released at the stroke of midnight May 6:
</P>
<P>
   No. 123: A computer suffering a year 2000 problem.
</P>
<P>
   No. 262: Five Mensa membership cards.
</P>
<P>
   No. 167: A 15-foot-tall monument to Grimace, the McDonald's
Happy Meal character.
</P>
<P>
   No. 40: A tenured professor willing to recite profane lyrics
from a gangsta rap song.
</P>
<P>
   Each team works from an identical list; items are assigned
points, based on difficulty, and the team with the most points by
Sunday afternoon is the winner. The wording of certain clues often
suggests a trip to a far-flung destination _ having a team member
photographed with an Ontario police officer, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Teams are often elaborately organized, with ``page masters''
assigned to each page of the list and at least one person operating
a computer long after midnight in search of Web sites that will
lead the team to cubic zirconia (20 points) or Chicago Bulls season
tickets (15 points) or an autographed photograph of the Food
Network star Jacqui Malouf (30 points).
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the items on the list was the `street value of Mount
Everest,''' said Sam Hunt, a freshman competing for his dorm,
Shoreland Hall. ``So we posted it on Ebay, and made it look pretty,
with a nice picture of the mountain and everything. The bidding got
up to $180 before we got kicked off the site.''
</P>
<P>
   The Shoreland team is run out of sixth-floor dormitory room of
its captain, Ryan Miller. By the end of the weekend, Thai food
containers litter the floor and at least three trash cans are
overflowing with empty soda cans. The members have slept little if
at all, and the room is a nest of cables that wire no fewer than
six personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   When the phone rings, it is answered with a curt ``Command
central'' and calls are kept short so that the line can be free for
a check-in from the road-trip group, probably somewhere in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what we can gather, the road-trip team is doing really
well,'' Miller says. ``Except last time they checked in, they
sounded drunk.''
</P>
<P>
   Other items on this year's list included building a nuclear
reactor from scratch (one team was actually successful _ this is
the University of Chicago, after all), an edible iMac computer and
a ticket to a local theater for a certain movie opening May 19. (To
these students, the date needs no further explanation.)
</P>
<P>
   No one is really sure how or when the scavenger hunt began, but
they do know it is a welcome break from economics exams and
Shakespeare papers _ a way to demonstrate, in Howe's words, that
``we actually can have fun on this campus.''
</P>
<P>
   And how do you say fun on a college campus better than a keg
toss? As part of the Scavolympics, a string of a dozen events
before the final judging that teams compete for points in, all 13
teams came together to recreate a battle of the Civil War, to
demonstrate a fight between Aunt Jemima and Mrs. Butterworth, and,
yes, to toss a keg.
</P>
<P>
   Competing for his dorm, Hitchcock-Snell, 23-year-old Niyi
Omojola, after minutes earlier winning the competition that called
for contestants to eat an entire bottle of squeeze cheese, won the
keg toss. While others had grabbed the kegs with two hands, taken a
few steps and heaved, he held it with one hand, arm extended, and
spun around like a discus thrower, propelling the keg beyond the
other teams' markers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to get some torque,'' said Omojola, a junior.
``If you can direct that torque in a straight line, you can throw
it pretty far. People were trying to muscle it, and that's not
going to work.''
</P>
<P>
   And if you can't say fun at the U. of C., with a little torque
and a keg toss, certainly you can with a nuclear reactor.
</P>
<P>
   Two physics majors, Justin Kasper and Fred Niell, gathered up
some spare junk from their physics labs and dorm rooms and built a
plutonium-producing reactor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of scary how easy it was to do,'' said Niell,
assuring onlookers that there was only a trace of plutonium _
nothing harmful. ``It only took us about a day to build it. We've
been thinking about it for a few days and we gathered the parts,
and last night we assembled it. In Justin's room _ he lost the coin
toss.''

TIP YOUR HAT TO IMPORTS - OUR EXPORT INDUSTRY NEEDS THEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carla Hills, former U.S. trade representative, remarked last
week to the Asia Society and the Seattle Rotary Club that neither
the Democrats nor the Republicans had stood up in the 1996
elections for open trade.
</P>
<P>
   Even politicians and chief executives who thump for trade most
often argue from an export perspective. President Clinton, who
speaks for the pro-trade wing of the Democratic Party, has a
President's Export Council. Washington journalist Greg Rushford
asks in his trade policy newsletter, ``Can anyone imagine President
Clinton creating an Import Council?''
</P>
<P>
   Exports create jobs. How many times have we heard that? But do
imports destroy jobs? If exports are good, are imports bad?
</P>
<P>
   I asked Hills about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``That just infuriates me,'' she said. ``Remember, we fought a
war in 1991 for the privilege of importing oil. We import
technology, we import raw materials, we import know-how that make
us more competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   A moment's thought should convince anyone that this is so.
Consider Seattle-based Starbucks Coffee. It is a huge contributor
to the prosperity of Seattle, with revenue filtering in from all
over North America, and now even from Japan and China. Most of the
value of a cup of coffee is in the roasting and the serving, but it
is based entirely on imported beans.
</P>
<P>
   Starbucks' espresso machines are imported, too _ from Italy.
(The ones the stores use have final assembly in Ballard, a
neighborhood in Seattle.) Lots of companies in Seattlle depend on
imported equipment. We have microbreweries with vats from Germany
and bakeries with ovens from France. Paper mills use machines from
Sweden. Our biggest fishing boats use filleting machines from
Germany and fish-mincing equipment from Japan.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's labor. To pick our apples, which we export to
Asia and Mexico, we import the labor of Mexicans. In Seattle, our
software and biotechnology companies import cranial capacity from
India, Taiwan, Japan, Britain and dozens of other places, which
thereby suffer from ``brain drains.''
</P>
<P>
   Our export industry not only needs imported inputs, they need
imported competition. If Caterpillar doesn't face Komatsu here, it
will have less of a chance in markets abroad.
</P>
<P>
   We're still arguing from the export perspective. We import to
export. It is the argument used to sell NAFTA: that if we tear down
the walls with Canada and Mexico, we will export more, and create
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Worriers over the ``great sucking sound'' prophesied we would
import more, and destroy jobs. In fact, we have imported and
exported more, and in the process of becoming more specialized and
efficient, shifted jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Free trade has made Americans more efficient. But efficiency
does not reliably create jobs; it reliably creates wealth. (People
can have jobs at any level of efficiency. Look at India.)
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan understands that. The chairman of the Federal
Reserve Board spoke recently in Dallas, and said, ``We try to
promote free trade on the mistaken ground that it will create
jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Trade, Greenspan said, creates and destroys jobs. It opens
opportunities for some and creates problems for others. It is part
of what he called the ``continuous churning of an economy in which
the new replaces the old.'' What it reliably creates is profits,
and, for labor with flexibility, skills and bargaining power, high
wages.
</P>
<P>
   The value of wages depends on what's available to buy, which
once again depends on imports. My son's baseball team cap is from
Bangladesh and his mitt is from the Philippines. His soccer ball is
from Pakistan and his bicycle is from China.
</P>
<P>
   Each of them could be made in the United States, and perhaps
with fewer labor hours. With our machines, we could probably make
most of the things we import with fewer labor hours. But there is
only so much labor to go around; it is virtually fully employed
already; and Americans have chosen, probably wisely, to produce
other things with it.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to importing relatively freely, Americans also have
chosen to build a distribution and retailing system without peer.
That stretches our incomes. Consider a comparison from this week's
Asiaweek magazine in Hong Kong. The gross domestic product of Japan
is $33,800 per person, and of the United States, $29,950. Based on
official exchange rates, Japan is ahead of us. Adjusted for what
consumers can buy, Japan shrinks to $23,105, 23 percent behind the
$30,025 figure for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   So tip your hat to imports. They may get no respect from
politicians, who relate to us by what we sell rather than what we
buy. Someday, they'll notice that we need to do both.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal
Reserve on Tuesday after the Federal Open Market Committee said it
had left interest rates unchanged but had adopted a stance to raise
borrowing costs in the future:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While the F.O.M.C. did not take action today to alter the stance
of monetary policy, the committee was concerned about the potential
for a buildup of inflationary imbalances that could undermine the
favorable performance of the economy and therefore adopted a
directive that is tilted toward the possibility of a firming in the
stance of monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   Trend increases in costs and core prices have generally remained
quite subdued. But domestic financial markets have recovered and
foreign economic prospects have improved since the easing of
monetary policy last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Against the background of already-tight domestic labor markets
and ongoing strength in demand in excess of productivity gains, the
committee recognizes the need to be alert to developments over
coming months that might indicate that financial conditions may no
longer be consistent with containing inflation.  &QL;

NASI STOCK LAGS DESPITE HIGH EARNINGS RATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Shares in North American Scientific Instruments
Inc. rose slightly Tuesday as the medical supplies manufacturer
announced record sales and earnings for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Stock in the company, which makes radioactive pellets used to
treat prostate cancer, rose by 12.5 cents, or 1.6 percent, to
$7.875. More than 82,000 shares traded hands, about double the
issue's 30-day average trading volume.
</P>
<P>
   The stock gain was small despite an earnings report Tuesday
morning that showed a 122 percent gain, to $3 million, in second
quarter sales, compared with sales of $1.4 million in the like
period last year. Net income for North American was $717,000, or 10
cents per diluted share, for the quarter that ended April 30,
compared with $279,000, or 4 cents per share, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a great quarter,'' said Alan Edrick, North American's
chief financial officer. Edrick noted that the results mark the
sixth consecutive quarter of record revenues and the 16th
consecutive profitable quarter for the company.
</P>
<P>
   The few analysts who cover North American say the slow increase
in the stock price is not surprising, but they blame it on the
small-cap sector in general rather than anything in the Chatsworth
firm's numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is small-cap stocks have underperformed large-cap
companies, and while they've started to do better they're still
lagging,'' said Paine Webber analyst Charles Olsziewski.
</P>
<P>
   Olsziewski said there was some concern last year that an
oversupply of radioactive pellets might hurt profits for North
American and other suppliers, a fear aggravated when competitor
Theragenics Corp. missed analysts' estimates in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither of those really affected North American's growth, but
the market has to sort through the numbers'' to get comfortable
with the company's stock again, he said.

   At one time, North American stock was among the best performing
issues in Southern California, growing by more than 1,000 percent
in 1997 alone. But analysts' expectations for the seed, or
brachytherapy, market proved too optimistic as many physicians
clung to traditional treatments for prostate cancer, including
radical surgery, said Justin Vaicek, an analyst at Cruttenden Roth
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   North American stock fell last year from as high as $32 a share
to its current range of $5 to $8. If the company can continue to
show sequential and year-on-year gains, however, it's only a matter
of time before the stock rebounds, Vaicek said. The analyst has a
``strong buy'' recommendation on North American shares and a
12-month target price of $15.

OPENER WAS BENCHMARK FOR LAKERS' BAD BENCH PLAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ A poor outing from Shaquille O'Neal, the Los
Angeles Lakers can occasionally survive. But couple that with a
nonexistent effort from the Lakers' role players, and they'll lose
the way they did Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   They need more than O'Neal's 21 points, but perhaps more
important, the Lakers need more than the two points, five rebounds
and two assists they got from their bench. That's little to show
for 62 minutes of combined play by Rick Fox, Robert Horry, Derek
Harper and Sean Rooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have a bench, you're not gonna win ballgames,''
Horry said, ``but sometimes the bench doesn't always need to score
points.''
</P>
<P>
   But they didn't even keep pace with their Spurs counterparts,
who totaled 17 points and 15 rebounds, led by Will Perdue's six and
nine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has to step it up,'' coach Kurt Rambis said. ``We
want big performances, special performances, out of two or three
guys every night. A good example for them is Perdue. He came in and
did a real good job for them. We need somebody doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who went 0 for 5, said the Spurs' smothering defense denied
the Lakers quality shots, and the Lakers didn't respond well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think we weren't as fluid as we would have liked to
have been as a unit and we didn't do the things we've done in the
past,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth impression: They won the game, but the Spurs were
impressed with the new-and-improved Lakers, who they routed by 27
points less than a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Greg Popovich called them ``a very good Laker team, a team
that's totally different from the one we played last time. They're
so much more disciplined, their spacing is so much better, and
they're so damn talented, it's scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Spurs guard Avery Johnson agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much better. Much better. Much better,'' he said. ``They're so
much more unselfish, they're playing much better defense and right
now they seem like they're all about winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Healing: A day after scoring 21 points, Glen Rice said his sore
right elbow is fine, if not fully recovered. He practiced without
limitations Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The elbow is feeling pretty good,'' he said. ``I wouldn't say
it's at 100 percent, but it's pretty close.''
</P>
<P>
   What's the point: For the first time in a long time, the Lakers
used Kobe Bryant at point guard late in Monday's game, trying to
take advantage of the smaller Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I was gonna try to get some post-ups. That was one
of the main intentions,'' Bryant said. ``Probably in Game 2, if
they have Avery Johnson out there, we'll probably do the same thing
again, take little Avery down to the box.''

WITNESS RECALLS LOUIMA IN AGONY AT POLICE STATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Brooklyn teen-ager who had been in a police station
holding cell testified Tuesday that he heard banging and screaming
in a restroom next door at the time prosecutors say Abner Louima
was being tortured there by officers.
</P>
<P>
   The witness, Connelle Lugg, 19, said a police officer then
pushed Louima, his pants down and blood flowing from cuts on his
face, into the cell and told him to get on his knees. There, Lugg
said, amid the stench of feces on his underwear, Louima lay down on
the floor, moaned in pain and asked to be taken to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Lugg gave his harrowing description in a soft, steady voice in a
hushed courtroom in federal district court in Brooklyn, at the
trial of four officers from the 70th Precinct. They are accused of
brutalizing Louima, 32, a Haitian immigrant who was arrested in a
melee outside a Flatbush nightclub in August 1997 and was
mistakenly believed to have punched one of the officers.
</P>
<P>
   When an ambulance crew eventually arrived and gave Louima a
chair to sit in, Lugg said, ``he was touching his head and stomach
and screaming,'' until the officer who had placed him in the cell
returned, pulled away the chair, told him with an obscenity to shut
up and took Louima's picture.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by a prosecutor to identify the officer, Lugg looked
quickly toward the defense table and picked out the ``man in the
brown jacket'' _ Officer Justin A. Volpe, who is charged with
torturing Louima by ramming a stick into his rectum and then into
his mouth in the station house restroom.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say that Louima suffered a torn rectum and bladder,
requiring two months of hospitalization and three operations, after
Volpe attacked him with the stick while another officer on trial,
Charles Schwarz, held him down.
</P>
<P>
   The two other officers, Thomas Bruder and Thomas Wiese, are
charged with joining Volpe and Schwarz in beating Louima in a
police car before he was taken to the station house. Prosecutors
say a fifth defendant, Sgt. Michael Bellomo, tried to cover up the
beating in the police car.
</P>
<P>
   Just before Lugg took the witness stand Tuesday, a detective who
had shown him pictures of police officers several days after the
reported attack on Louima testified that Lugg had said at one point
that ``he didn't recognize anybody'' in a group of photos including
Volpe's.
</P>
<P>
   But at another point, Det. Darren Bullock said, Lugg told him
that Volpe ``looked familiar'' as the officer who brought Louima
into the cell. The detective told Volpe's lawyer, Marvyn M.
Kornberg, that he did not consider that a positive identification.
</P>
<P>
   Kornberg also sought to raise doubts about Lugg's credibility by
suggesting that he was testifying for the prosecution in return for
a reward in his own case. Lugg was being held at the station house
on charges of possession of a dangerous weapon and menacing.
</P>
<P>
   The defense lawyer noted that Lugg testified before a federal
grand jury looking into the case on Nov. 12, 1997, two days after
the state charges against him were dismissed. That grand jury
eventually indicted the officers, in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But Kornberg also sought to gain information helpful to the
defense from Lugg.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did he ever tell anyone, in your presence, that someone stuck
a stick in his rectum?'' Kornberg asked the teen-ager, referring to
Louima.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Lugg replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did he ever tell anyone, in your presence, that he was
sodomized?'' ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did Officer Volpe have a stick when he brought Louima in the
cell?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, in answering questions from one of the prosecutors,
Alan Vinegrad, an assistant U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, Lugg said
that at one point before an ambulance arrived for Louima, another
officer entered the cell, took off Louima's handcuffs and ``told
him to pull up his pants.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors and defense lawyers have identified that man as
Bruder, whose lawyer has portrayed him as a ``Good Samaritan.''

WHITE HOUSE WILL PROPOSE PUBLIC SCHOOL CHOICE PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As part of the law that determines how billions of
dollars in federal money is to be spent for education over the next
five years, the Clinton administration plans to propose on
Wednesday that every school district allow low-income parents to
send their children to any public school in their town, officials
say.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, to be announced by Education Secretary Richard W.
Riley, is the administration's effort to grapple with the issue of
school choice. While conservatives generally support vouchers that
would help low-income parents send their children to private and
parochial schools, many Democrats say such programs would undercut
support for public education.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, presenting his own education program in a
campaign speech in Iowa, Vice President Al Gore said parents
``should have more choice in their children's public schools'' but
added: ``Of course we must reject the false promise of siphoning
public school funding away to private schools. That would only make
things worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials did not offer details on how the administration's plan
would work. But the Acting Deputy Education Secretary, Marshall S.
Smith, spoke favorably of programs like those in Cambridge, Mass.,
and Montclair, N.J., that rely on magnet schools, specializing in
fields like science or music, to attract children throughout the
district.
</P>
<P>
   The law in question is the Elementary and Secondary Education
Act, which comes up for renewal this year. Most of the money it
allocates is for Title I, the federal program to aid low-income
children.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the provision on school choice was part of the
administration's effort to hold schools accountable, especially in
educating low-income children. To that end, he said, Secretary
Riley will propose a plan under which all districts would grade the
schools on their performance and post the grades so that they could
be seen by the public.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce N. Reed, President Clinton's chief domestic policy
adviser, said today that the White House was eager to use the
measure to frame a congressional debate ``over whether there should
be a strong national role for the federal government in holding the
schools accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration and its Democratic allies in Congress say the
federal role flows from the school districts' acceptance of federal
money, especially the money intended to improve the education of
poor children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The national government,'' Reed said, ``should be insisting on
results for its money.The debate in Congress and in the 2000
campaign will be over what role the federal government should
have.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress generally prefer to keep school
accountability on the local and state level. Representative William
F. Goodling, the Pennsylvania Republican who heads the House
Committee on Education and the Work Force, said tonight that he
applauded Riley's aims but differed on how to achieve them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration's proposals trample on our nation's long
and proven traditions of local control of education,'' Goodling
said in a statement. ``Republicans and others who value flexibility
and local initiative have a better approach.''
</P>
<P>
   A conservative critic of Education Department policies, Chester
E. Finn Jr., spoke favorably of a system advocated by the educator
Diane Ravitch under which low-income children would be eligible for
federal aid and would be able to take it from one school to
another.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Finn said, ``the school system, which has already failed to
teach the kid, gets the money.'' More broadly, he added, programs
for low-income, low-performing children simply do not work.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 34 years and $120 billion, are we going to think
radically about these programs or just tweak them a little once
again?'' asked Finn, who was an assistant secretary of education in
the Reagan administration and is now a senior fellow at the
Manhattan Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Smith rejected those criticisms, saying: ``Finn's wrong. We are
gaining. Texas and North Carolina have shown strong gains.''
</P>
<P>
   These gains, Smith said, have amounted to an advance of a half
to a full grade among poor children where local school officials
held school teachers and administrators accountable in improving
their education. He ridiculed Ms. Ravitch's portable entitlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's the kid going to go?'' Smith asked. ``Take the subway
to Westchester County? It doesn't mean anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Feldman, president of the American Federation of
Teachers, endorsed Secretary Riley's proposals and said the federal
law was ``the only program that goes anywhere near leveling the
playing field for poor kids.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very supportive of the efforts to raise the standards
of the schools,'' Ms. Feldman said. ``We support allowing parents
to transfer their children to better-performing public schools, and
we have been fighting against the use of uncredentialed teachers
for our most vulnerable children.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Feldman also spoke favorably about another Riley proposal:
prohibiting uncertified teachers from teaching in low-income areas.
She said that of the 75,000 teachers in New York City, for example,
10,000 had not been certified to teach, compared with perhaps 500
in the rest of the state.
</P>
<P>
   But Kati Haycock, director of the Education Trust, a nonprofit
group that advocates better training of teachers, called the
administration proposal ``far too little, far too late.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The proposal only establishes minimal qualifications for
teachers hired after the effective date of the legislation,'' Ms.
Haycock said. ``It will not affect the full Title I teaching force
until every teacher currently teaching in a Title I school has been
replaced _ roughly a generation from now.''

L.A., LONG BEACH PORTS IN HIGH_STAKES CHESS GAME FOR MAERSK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY RICK ORLOV  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Annual rent payments of $12 million or more are
only the tip of the iceberg in a competition between the ports of
Long Beach and Los Angeles to win one of the world's largest cargo
companies as a tenant.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles officials are attempting to lure Maersk Pacific Ltd.
to leave its Long Beach home and move to the new Pier 400 facility
being built at a cost of some $360 million and scheduled to open in
2001.
</P>
<P>
   If Maersk moves to Los Angeles, the city will be in line for
additional millions in revenue because of cargo coming through the
port and extra gains based on the company's future expansion.
</P>
<P>
   The two harbors' fight over the Danish shipping firm is part of
an ongoing effort to find customers for an expanded Los Angeles
port as international trade becomes one of the prime movers of the
local economy. Money is at stake as well as supremacy in the
nation's shipping world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maersk is one of several customers we're looking at and in the
negotiation phase with,'' said Barbara Yamamoto, spokeswoman for
the Los Angeles Harbor. ``We're looking at anyone who can move the
volumes of cargo through the port.''
</P>
<P>
   Long Beach spokesman Art Wong said, however, that the port was
trying to accommodate Maersk in its need for more acreage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their lease expires in 2003, and they have been looking for
more room,'' Wong said. ``We are trying to accommodate them and all
our other shipping lines who are looking for more space.
</P>
<P>
   ``I imagine Los Angeles would like very much to get them.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials could not provide immediate estimates of the total
value of Maersk to its host port, but at the least it pays $12
million a year in rent to Long Beach. That's the base amount Los
Angeles would expect, with increases depending on the amount of
land the company needs.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the income would be determined partly by how much cargo
Maersk brings in each year.
</P>
<P>
   In Long Beach, Wong said, once the cargo shipped in reaches a
certain point, the company pays the port a percentage. Exact
figures on the amount of cargo brought in are not available because
they are considered proprietary, Wong said.
</P>
<P>
   Maersk is one of the world's largest cargo operators, with
offices in more than 250 cities _ its U.S. headquarters is in New
Jersey _ and 100 ships.
</P>
<P>
   Maersk spokesman Tom Boyd said he could not comment on any
details of negotiations with Los Angeles or whether the company
would leave Long Beach. But, he said, various ports are always in
contact with the firm to get some of its business.
</P>
<P>
   Long Beach, which is the nation's busiest port, has had some
problems in recent years in being able to expand. It had sought to
use a former Navy site in its efforts to win a contract with the
Chinese Ocean Shipping Co. but was turned down by the Defense
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles officials have been talking to COSCO ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Economic Development Corp.
of Los Angeles County, said Maersk officials have wanted to expand
in recent years to meet the demand from Asia but have been unable
to find the space in Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are increasing their capacity in the Pacific, and they
keep building larger and larger terminals,'' Kyser said. ``With
Pier 400, Los Angeles has tremendous bargaining power.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't understand that this is a major game of chess
with millions of dollars involved. Long Beach and Los Angeles are
the two most attractive ports on the West Coast because they have
access to the rest of the United States and even Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   That attraction will increase with the completion of the Alameda
Corridor project, a $2 billion high-speed dedicated roadway from
the ports to Union Station.
</P>
<P>
   Kyser said the two ports have been alternating being tops in the
nation in terms of cargo _ a competition that has resulted in both
ports being profitable compared with others along the West Coast,
such as Oakland, Seattle and Tacoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big growth the past couple of years has been international
trade, and that's going to continue,'' Kyser said. ``Hollywood is
down now, but the international trade is expected to continue to
grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Wong said he doubted Maersk had many permanent employees _
perhaps under 100 _ but that hundreds of jobs are created with the
hiring of longshoremen every time a ship comes to port.

PLOT TWIST IN UNUSUAL MORGAN STANLEY CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The case of Christian Curry was already strange
enough, with the lurid photographs and the forged e-mails and
allegations of racism and homophobia within one of Wall Street's
biggest firms.
</P>
<P>
   Curry, once an analyst for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, last
April accused the company of dismissing him because explicit
photographs of him were published in an adult magazine for gay men.
</P>
<P>
   Months later, Morgan Stanley officials told the authorities of a
plot by Curry to plant racist e-mail in their computers. Curry was
arrested and charged with forgery within weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes this unexpected plot twist: The Manhattan district
attorney's office Tuesday dropped all criminal charges against
Curry, saying that Morgan Stanley had paid $10,000 to the
prosecution's star witness in the forgery plot.
</P>
<P>
   The witness had set up a meeting in August 1998 between Curry
and an undercover officer who was posing as a computer hacker,
officials said. Days later, Curry was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, within days of the defendant's arrest, officials at
Morgan Stanley wired a $10,000 payment into an account designated
by the confidential informant,'' Assistant District Attorney Leroy
Frazer said Tuesday in Criminal Court in Manhattan. ``Morgan
Stanley officials withheld from this office information regarding
the facts and circumstances of this payment.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than being viewed as the victims of a plot by Curry,
officials at Morgan Stanley _ along with the informer _ find
themselves the subject of an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as we're concerned, the case against Christian Curry is
over,'' said Daniel Castleman, chief of the investigation division
in the district attorney's office. ``I cannot discuss the conduct
of either the confidential informant or the officials at Morgan
Stanley as that is a matter under investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley officials declined to respond to Tuesday's
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley hired Curry in July 1997, assigning him to its
real estate investment banking division.
</P>
<P>
   Almost a year later, Curry said, photographs that he had posed
for while he was a student at Columbia University were published
without his knowledge in Playguy, an adult magazine for gay men.
Word of the photographs quickly spread at Morgan Stanley, and Curry
was dismissed from his job days later.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley officials said he was dismissed for abusing
company expense accounts, but Curry suspected otherwise, and his
lawyers gave Morgan Stanley a deadline to respond to his
grievances.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought he was a homosexual, OK, and I also think they
had a problem with him being black,'' said Curry's civil lawyer,
Benedict Morelli, adding that his client is not gay.
</P>
<P>
   Awaiting Morgan Stanley's response, lawyers said, Curry began
discussing the e-mail plot with a college acquaintance who did not
work at Morgan Stanley, C. Joseph Luethke.
</P>
<P>
   Curry's criminal lawyer, Earl Rawlins, acknowledged that Curry
had offered $200 to the undercover officer to plant phony e-mail _
``You always look for an edge,'' he explained _ but he contended
that Curry was entrapped by Luethke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gee whiz, you can do a lot of persuasion for $10,000,''
Rawlins said.
</P>
<P>
   According to prosecutors, Luethke reported his discussions with
Curry first to Morgan Stanley, then to police, who began to
investigate along with the district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   But neither Morgan Stanley officials nor Luethke told
investigators that they were discussing the matter with each other,
or of their ``ongoing negotiations'' about ``possible pecuniary
payments,'' Frazer, the assistant district attorney, said Tuesday.
This omission tarnished the credibility of the Morgan Stanley
officials and the informer, Luethke, as witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday, Luethke denied that Morgan Stanley had
paid him in connection with his efforts as an informer against
Curry.
</P>
<P>
   Curry, 24, now working as a model in Beverly Hills, Calif.,
declined to comment Tuesday, referring all questions to his
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Rawlins described his client as relieved that he no longer faces
the threat of prison: Curry, who had been arrested one day before
the deadline his lawyers had given Morgan Stanley to respond to his
grievances, had been charged with forgery, conspiracy, attempted
trespass of a computer and attempted coercion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The district attorney's office saw through this darn thing and
that's kind of good,'' Rawlins said.
</P>
<P>
   Morelli, Curry's civil lawyer, also reacted with glee, saying he
planned to file a $1.35 billion lawsuit against Morgan Stanley in
New York state Supreme Court Wednesday, alleging libel, human
rights violations and conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things were done to him,'' Morelli said when asked
how Curry's firing justified $1.35 billion in compensation.

XEROX-MICROSOFT DEAL LINKS VARIETY OF TECHNOLOGIES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ Xerox and Microsoft Tuesday announced an
alliance aimed at bridging the worlds of paper documents and
computers.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the new relationship the Microsoft Corp. will license
a Web surfing technology developed at the Xerox Corp.'s Palo Alto
Research Center, and Xerox will incorporate Embedded NT, a version
of Microsoft's Windows NT operating system, in a future generation
of its high-end copying systems.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox officials said the Microsoft deal would have no impact on
a similiar agreement Xerox has with Sun Microsystems, whose
computers power a number of Xerox product lines.
</P>
<P>
   However, Xerox said Tuesday that it would switch to Intel Corp.
processors to power its high-end Document Centre corporate printing
technology, which has until now been based on the PowerPC
microprocessor jointly developed by the International Business
Machines Corp., Motorola and Apple Computer Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost-value trade-offs are in favor of Embedded NT,'' said
Rick Thoman, Xerox's president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies said they would also build linkages between
Document Centre and Microsoft's Exchange e-mail server that would
enable users to view scanned paper documents on their computers as
editable text.
</P>
<P>
   Although the reliability of Windows NT has been questioned in
so-called mission-critical industrial applications, the company has
succeeded in persuading hardware developers to use it in a wide
variety of devices, ranging from point-of-sale systems to computer
routers and airline avionics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Microsoft was embarrassed after the Navy's Yorktown
Aegis missile cruiser ended up dead in the water after a software
failure related to Windows NT. The company says it has since
improved the operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Tuesday that the deal also offered evidence that
Xerox was improving the management of its technologies. The company
has long been criticized for being too slow in commercializing
technologies it develops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Xerox is taking a much healthier view of its technology and
how it fits in the PC world,'' said Mark Anderson, an industry
consultant at Technology Alliance Partners.
</P>
<P>
   The new Xerox-Microsoft relationship focuses on a set of
technologies that have been priorities for both companies _
so-called knowledge management software and systems designed to
organize information and documents in ways that make data more
accessible and understandable within large organizations.
</P>
<P>
   As part of Tuesday's announcement Microsoft has licensed Web
Forager, a Xerox technology that allows a user to page through
information on the Internet much as a reader would leaf through the
pages of a book.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox and Microsoft have not in the past been strong allies.
Charles Simonyi, who while at Xerox PARC helped develop what is
known as a wysiwyg _ for ``what-you-see is-what-you-get'' _ text
editor called Bravo, left to become the lead developer for
Microsoft Word, leading to accusations that Microsoft had built its
word processing software around a Xerox invention.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, when Apple Computer sued Microsoft for copyright
infringement, contending that the Windows operating system stole
the look and feel of the Macintosh, Microsoft's chairman, Bill
Gates, asserted that in fact both companies had borrowed technology
developed at Xerox's PARC laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, Thoman said, ``nobody has any hard feelings about
something that happened 20 years ago.''

JUDGE VOIDS N.Y. LAW CURBING MEDICAID BENEFITS FOR IMMIGRANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A state judge has struck down a law that has denied
Medicaid benefits to thousands of needy legal immigrants in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The state law, passed in 1997, barred most poor immigrants who
arrived after Aug. 4, 1996, from receiving Medicaid coverage for
nonemergency illnesses for five years.
</P>
<P>
   The law, however, granted exemptions for immigrants living in
nursing homes or suffering from AIDS as of September 1997, while
denying coverage to other sickly newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   Calling that distinction arbitrary, Justice Sheila Abdus-Salaam
of state Supreme Court in Manhattan said the rules violated the
equal protection statutes of the federal and state constitutions.
States cannot choose which poor people will receive aid, she said,
ruling that the law ``discriminates against many legal immigrants
and places vital public assistance benefits beyond their reach.''
</P>
<P>
   In her opinion, which was released Monday, Judge Abdus-Salaam
said the law also violated a state statute that requires New York
to provide aid and support to the needy.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the poor called the ruling a victory for
immigrants, citing the cases of people who were denied Medicaid
coverage while suffering from kidney failure, paralysis and other
ailments. The advocates said the decision makes thousands of legal
immigrants eligible for Medicaid for the first time since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   State officials, who had argued that providing health care to
all immigrants would lead to reductions in Medicaid benefits to
U.S. citizens, said they had not yet decided whether to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the process of reviewing the decision and beyond that
we really can't speculate,'' John Signor, a spokesman for the state
Health Department, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   New York enacted the statute in response to the federal welfare
law, which barred the use of federal funds for Medicaid benefits
for legal immigrants. State officials said it would cost New York
more than $33 million to cover the bills of the estimated 100,000
needy immigrants eligible for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   ``To meet this financial burden, the state would have had little
choice but to allocate monies from other social service programs,
reduce benefits to all Medicaid recipients, or otherwise increase
revenues through taxes, fees and assessments,'' lawyers for the
state argued in court papers.
</P>
<P>
   But Judge Abdus-Salaam ruled that the U.S. Supreme Court had
already barred states from using limited finances as a rationale
for discriminating among equal classes of people.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates echoed that assessment. ``The state is not able to
pick and choose among its favorite immigrants,'' said Elisabeth
Benjamin, a lawyer for the Legal Aid Society, which filed the
lawsuit against the state last October. ``The state must treat all
immigrants and all state residents equally.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Under increasing public pressure to resolve the
conflict in Kosovo, President Clinton said Tuesday that he would
not rule out the use of ground troops but that he was hopeful that
diplomatic efforts under way with the Russians would be successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I and everyone else has always said that we intend to see our
objectives achieved and that we have not and will not take any
option off the table,'' Clinton told reporters at the White House
when asked if he was reconsidering the use of ground troops to
expel Yugoslav forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   While administration officials insisted that the president's
comments did not signal a change of policy, Clinton has come under
increasing pressure, particularly from Britain, to consider ground
troops. The air war went into its 55th day Tuesday without having
achieved its goals. Britain is worried that troops need to be
deployed by June in order to prevent a catastrophe this winter for
the Kosovar refugees who have been forced from their homes and are
living in tent encampments.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Clinton had indicated only that he approved of the
Pentagon and NATO decision to update a military assessment of a
need for ground troops, as well as other military options like the
size of a peacekeeping force. His aides and military officials have
repeatedly insisted that ground troops were not a viable option,
while acknowledging that the Pentagon, as a matter of course, has
reviewed contingencies, including land combat.
</P>
<P>
   The British foreign minister, Robin Cook, appeared to soften his
stance on the need for ground troops Tuesday, after he failed to
sway his NATO allies in Brussels on Monday. He is still planning to
come to Washington on Thursday, though, to press the case.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and the Pentagon continued to press the air campaign
Tuesday night, although poor weather restricted airstrikes. NATO
said that its missiles hit an empty fuel-storage depot a mile
southwest of the center of Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital, and that
warplanes pounded the area around Prizren in Kosovo. The Yugoslav
media said that NATO missiles hit at least four cities, killing a
woman and injuring 12 people.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton defended the strikes Tuesday, insisting that ``we ought
to stay with the strategy that we have and work it through to the
end.''
</P>
<P>
   The renewed discussion of ground troops, combined with a
measurable slip in American public support for the NATO air
campaign, is prompting the Clinton administration to scramble to
find a diplomatic solution to the conflict before the use of ground
troops becomes inevitable and raises the possibility of American
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the pressure for a diplomatic solution is a sense that
the unity of the NATO alliance is increasingly fractious. Several
countries, including Italy and Greece, have been fretting about the
lengthy bombing campaign and its strains on domestic politics.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Tuesday: ``I am very hopeful, obviously, that the
diplomatic efforts that are being made in the State Department and
with the Russians will bear some fruit.''
</P>
<P>
   Talks between Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott; the
special Russian envoy to the Balkans, Victor Chernomyrdin, and
President Martii Ahtisaari of Finland, were to continue on
Wednesday morning. The talks have centered on ways to approach
Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav president, about proposals that
would lead to an end to the bombing campaign and the withdrawal of
Yugoslav forces from Kosovo. Finland is not part of NATO but is a
member of the European Union and will lead the union starting this
summer, giving it extra clout in any peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and NATO have been discussing the possible composition of
an international security force that would return the refugees to
Kosovo, and have disagreed recently over when to stop the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   While the president has avoided committing ground troops, he has
pledged that the United States would send soldiers as part of a
peacekeeping force when the war is over. A Pentagon spokesman said
Tuesday that that peacekeeping force would probably involve 45,000
to 50,000 soldiers, instead of the 28,000 contemplated before the
air war in Yugoslavia began, and that America would provide between
10 percent and 15 percent of those troops _ or 4,500 to 7,500.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the talks Tuesday, Talbott told reporters, ``These
are very tough issues but serious people are working on them.'' He
declined to give details of the talks. Some reports suggested that
Chernomyrdin would go to Belgrade later this week.
</P>
<P>
   While the shuttle diplomacy has yielded little so far, NATO's
airing of differences over ground troops and the president's remark
could be seen as a signal to Milosevic that NATO would not relent
in its campaign.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that while he believed NATO's airstrikes had been
effective, ``I don't think that we or our allies should take any
options off the table and that has been my position from the
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton has said from the March 24 start of the air war that
he had ``no intention'' of sending ground forces into a hostile
environment in the Balkans. As he explained in an interview on
March 31, ``The thing that bothers me about introducing ground
troops into a hostile situation _ into Kosovo and into the Balkans
_ is the prospect of never being able to get them out.''
</P>
<P>
   And three weeks ago he squelched an attempt by Britain to
reintroduce the topic at the NATO summit in Washington. Asked at a
news conference April 24 if a buildup of troops was preparation for
a ground invasion, the president said, ``No. The short answer is
no.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's disinclination to use ground troops has been
sufficiently clear that numerous military analysts, and retired
Gen. Colin Powell, have criticized the position as a strategic
blunder for signaling to the enemy just how far the allies would
go.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman, asserted Tuesday that
the president was not shifting his position.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it's prudent to always consider all of your options and
stay updated, which we are, given the assessments that are going
on, there's no change in our policy,'' he said. ``The president
believes we're going to get to where we need to get through the air
campaign and that we will get the conditions that we've laid out.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that the air campaign was effective because it was
driving Milosevic toward negotiations. ``You've seen reports today
out of Belgrade that senior government officials are talking about
wanting a diplomatic solution, trying to find a way out,'' Lockhart
said. ``It's because the campaign is working.''
</P>
<P>
   But the administration is concerned, as Clinton said last week,
that ``refugee fatigue'' may be settling in among the public, and a
new poll from the Pew Research Center shows that while a majority
of Americans still support the war, that support has ebbed over the
last month. The Pew survey reflects similar findings in other polls
conducted recently.
</P>
<P>
   Approval of American participation in the conflict has fallen to
53 percent from 62 percent in mid-April, the poll found. Fewer
Americans _ 32 percent _ are paying very close attention to the war
now than were just three weeks ago, and among them, support has
dropped 21 percent so that a majority now oppose airstrikes
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public is really wavering,'' said Andrew Kohut, director
of the center. ``That wavering is a combination of concern about
the unintended casualties and that the public doesn't think we're
winning.'' The public is almost evenly divided over whether to send
ground troops, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who has been a strong critic of the
administration's reluctance to use ground force, said that he
believed Clinton would seek some sort of settlement before sending
in ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're under great pressure,'' McCain, who is seeking the
Republican nomination for president, said in an interview Tuesday.
``I think they'll frantically seek a deal _ a dirty compromise _
and spin it and hope the Dow continues to go up. The whole thing is
very dispiriting.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberals too are adding their voice to the call for ground
troops. Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said ground troops would be needed
to force Milosevic to yield to bend to NATO demands. ``I am not
convinced that air power alone will get his forces out of Kosovo,''
Harkin said Tuesday after a three-day trip to the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   But Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster, said that these polls
``are making a mountain out of a molehill of changes in public
opinion.'' He added, ``You have some high-profile things like the
Chinese embassy thing and it causes a blip. Nobody's enthusiastic
about war. But there is certainly not anything like majority
opposition.

A SURVEY OF PASSENGERS FINDS THAT THE AIRLINES DO INDEED HAVE A
CUSTOMER-SATISFACTION PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Warranted or not, the image problem of airlines continues. The
latest critics are subscribers to Consumer Reports, who, according
to the June issue of the magazine, rate airlines ``only slightly
more favorably than they do cable TV companies and commercial diet
programs _ cellar dwellers in the magazine's customer satisfaction
rankings.''
</P>
<P>
   Among their complaints are the cutback in passenger amenities at
a time when profits are soaring for the major airlines. The sense
of dissatisfaction extends to meals, with Consumer Reports saying
that the average spending fell more than 26 percent between 1992
and 1998 _ to $4.16 a passenger from $5.67.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine used its survey results as well as performance data
from the Transportation Department to rate 18 airlines. Midwest
Express, the regional airline based in Milwaukee, scored highest in
satisfaction, but, the magazine said, ``its passengers paid for the
pampering with comparatively high fares.''
</P>
<P>
   Three low-fare airlines, Aloha, Midway and Southwest, were cited
for ``a superior combination of price and service.'' At the bottom
of the rankings, according to the magazine's subscribers, were
American, Delta and United, with many other major airlines not far
behind. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   United Airlines is offering discounts of as much as 60 percent
for travel that begins on Friday or Saturday of the Memorial Day
weekend and returns that Sunday or Monday. Every state but Hawaii
is included, as is Canada. Other airlines are expected to follow
suit.
</P>
<P>
   From July 2 through Sept. 6, United will add 2,107 seats a week
to Hawaii from the mainland, by starting a daily San Francisco-Maui
round trip and by substituting a 747-400 for a smaller DC-10 on its
San Francisco-Kona route.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, United will fly three daily nonstops to Hawaii from
both Los Angeles and San Francisco. Starting next month, United
will offer discounted round-trip business fares to Hawaii. These
include San Francisco to Honolulu, starting June 10, for $799; San
Francisco-Kona, starting July 2, $899; and Los Angeles-Honolulu,
starting July 11, $799. Restrictions apply.
</P>
<P>
   American Eagle, the American Airlines regional carrier, will
begin service July 29 between La Guardia Airport in New York and
Cleveland, offering six daily round trips on 50-seat jets. Eagle
gained the coveted takeoff and landing slots with its purchase of
Business Express earlier this year. The planes have leather seats,
a wardrobe closet for hanging bags, and check-in at the gate for
larger carry-on items, which can be reclaimed on the jetbridge upon
landing.
</P>
<P>
   American Express said the typical business fare during the first
quarter of this year was almost four times the lowest discount
fare. By contrast, three years ago the disparity was only two and a
half times the discount fare.
</P>
<P>
   The Minneapolis-St. Paul airport opened a conference center for
business travelers this Monday, on the mezzanine level of the
Lindbergh Terminal. In addition to eight conference rooms,
including one that can accommodate 100 people, the center is
equipped with data ports and telephones, while printing, copying,
shipping, catering and other business services are available. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   More than 50 hotels in the United States and Britain are making
newspapers from around the world available to guests by about 6:30
a.m. the same day _ an innovation made possible by transmitting the
contents of the papers to Xerox document technology centers in
major cities, where they are printed. The papers include The Times
of London, The Miami Herald, The Atlanta Constitution, The New York
Daily News, Liberation (France), Handelsblatt (Germany) as well as
papers from Austria, Brazil, Poland, Russia and Spain. Another
paper is Bloomberg News, the first time Bloomberg's financial news
service has been published in newspaper format.
</P>
<P>
   Hotels involved so far include the Regency, Regal United Nations
Plaza, Kitano and Millennium Broadway in New York, the Monaco in
Chicago, the Renaissance Mayflower in Washington and the Regent
Beverly Wilshire in Los Angeles. Press Point, a New York-based
company prints and distributes the papers.

 CLASSICS FROM '60s ARE BIG DRAW AT SOTHEBY'S SALE  
(jt) 
 By CAROL VOGEL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Strong examples of classic contemporary artists _
household names like Warhol, Calder and Bacon _ were snapped up in
short order at Sotheby's sale of contemporary art Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``People came to shop,'' said Christophe van de Weghe, a
Manhattan dealer who works at the Gagosian Gallery. ``Buyers knew
what they wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Buyers also knew what they didn't want, often leaving lesser
examples of artists like Motherwell, de Kooning, and Georg Baselitz
unsold, sometimes without even one a bid, sometimes with a bottom
fisher curiously testing how little a work would sell for.
</P>
<P>
   The sale totaled $25.4 million, right in the middle of its $21
million to $29 million estimate. Of the 52 works offered, 12 failed
to find buyers.
</P>
<P>
   It was predominantly works from the 1960s that stirred the
crowded salesroom into spirited bidding. Sotheby's seating chart
read like a who's who of contemporary art collectors, many of whom
actually bid for themselves. But as has been true recently, the
most expensive works were sold to unidentified telephone bidders.
</P>
<P>
   The sale featured several important Warhols, two of which were
part of the group of contemporary works being sold Tuesday night
from the estate of the German collector Helmut Kraetz. An
unidentified telephone bidder and Eli Broad, the Los Angeles
collector, both tried to buy ``Marlon,'' a 1966 silkscreen of
Marlon Brando from a photographic still taken from the 1954 movie
``The Wild One.'' Estimated to sell for $1.5 million to $2 million,
it became the evening's second most expensive painting, selling to
the telephone bidder for $2.6 million. The same buyer won another
bitter bidding battle, paying $1.6 million for the artist's 1962
``Campbell's Soup Can (Chicken With Rice),'' an early version of
the famous image in which the artist used handmade stencils to
create the can and the lettering and a rubber stamp for the yellow
stars that line the bottom of the can. The price was twice its
$800,000 high estimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marlon'' was from the Kraetz collection. So was , `Suicide'' a
1964 monotype on paper from the artist's much-sought-after disaster
series. Eight bidders tried hard to buy ``Suicide,'' which finally
sold for a whopping $717,500 to an unidentified bidder sitting in
the far back of the salesroom. The price was nearly five times its
high $150,000 estimate.
</P>
<P>
   (Final prices include the auction house's commission, 15 percent
of the first $50,000 plus 10 percent of the rest. Estimates do not
reflect commissions.)
</P>
<P>
   The evening's most expensive painting, and one of the rarest,
was Lucian Freud's ``Painter's Mother'' (1982-1984) in which he
painted his mother clad in white and lying on her bed. It was a
historically important painting, but not necessarily a commercial
one. Before the sale art historians had compared it to the famous
painting of Whistler's mother because the Freud shows the sitter
gazing into a world of her own, and the artist, like Whistler, used
rectangular planes of light to create a shadowy interior. There
were few bidders after the painting, which sold for $3.3 million to
Richard Nagy of the Dover Street Gallery in London. Calder was well
represented Tuesday night but the results were mixed. By far one of
the most interesting examples of his work to come up at auction in
decades was ``Constellation,'' commissioned in 1943 by Philip
Johnson and his sister Theodate Severns for Hidden House, their
Manhattan house. ( Johnson eventually gave the Calder to his
sister.) Three serious bidders tried to take the sculpture home.
Made of painted wood and wire, it was estimated to fetch $600,000
to $800,000 but eventually made more than twice its high estimate,
selling to an unidentified collector for $1.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Two standing mobiles, however, sold for below their low
estimates. ``White Dots on Red and Blue,'' (1951) which was
estimated to bring $300,000 to $400,000, sold for $227,500 to an
unidentified telephone bidder. Another standing mobile, which the
artist made 21 years later, ``Trepied'' (1972) was estimated to
sell for $1.5 million to $2 million. Larry Gagosian, the Manhattan
dealer, bought it for $1.5 million. ``The Glory Folk (Maquette)''
which includes both a stabile and a mobile and was created as a
maquette for a stage design for John Butler's ballet ``The Glory
Folk, performed at Spoleto in 1962, failed to sell at all. No one
was willing to pay more than $320,000, too far under its $400,000
low estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Ellsworth Kelly, one artist who has been getting a lot of
attention recently because important examples of his work have
recently been bought by both the Museum of Modern Art in New York
and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, was represented Tuesday
night. ``Red White,'' a 1966 painting of two red elliptical shapes,
was fought over by Broad, Anthony D'Offay, the London dealer, and
Douglas Cramer, the television producer, collector and trustee at
the Museum of Modern Art. Cramer finally bought the painting for
$662,500, just above its $600,000 high estimate.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few auction seasons, there have been many water
scenes by Gerhard Richter. Tuesday night Richter's ``Four Forest
Lake,'' (1969) a foggy photo-based painting, estimated to sell for
$1 million to $1.5 million, was bought by Simon de Pury, the former
chairman of Sotheby's Europe who is now a private dealer, for $1
million. e Pury didn't have to reach Tuesday night. But at
Sotheby's in London last summer he paid $2.3 million, three times
the high estimate for one of the artist's seascapes, painted a year
later. Basquiat is another artist whose works have been plentiful
at auction over the last year. ``Grillo'' (1984) four large panels
in an altarlike progression with a chaotic array of symbols, text
and images in the first and third panels and references to urban
life throughout, was estimated at $900,000 to $1.2 million, and an
unidentified telephone bidder was willing to pay $1.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was sublime really went through the roof,'' said Tobias
Meyer, head of Sotheby's contemporary art worldwide. ``What didn't
sell was simply not good enough and collectors knew it.''  &QL;

FORBES MAGAIZINE RANKS SEATTLE NO. 1 IN GROWTH OF `NEW ECONOMIES' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ARTHUR C. GORLICK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ You did it again, Seattle. A major magazine ranks you
No. 1 in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Forbes magazine says Seattle topped 162 metropolitan
areas in growth in jobs, income and output in the area's high
technology industries, including aerospace, computer software,
biotech, telecommunications, Internet companies and others.
</P>
<P>
   The city leads the nation in growth in this ``new economy,''
based on brainpower, as opposed to the ``old economy,'' based on
materials supplies, factories and transportation, Forbes reports.
</P>
<P>
   In its listing of the ``Top 50 places for business and
careers,'' Seattle ranked substantially ahead of No. 2 Austin,
Texas, using the complex formula employed by Forbes, a team of
economists from the Milken Institute of Santa Monica, Calif., and
Los Angeles-based economist David Friedman.
</P>
<P>
   Other metropolitan areas ranking high on Forbes' list include
No. 3 Dallas; No. 4 Ventura, Calif.; No. 5 Oakland, Calif.; No. 6
Middlesex-Somerset-Hunterdon, N.J.; No. 7 Denver; No. 8 San Jose,
Calif.; No. 9 Houston; and No. 10 Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The May 31 issue of Forbes contains the rankings but provides
little information about Seattle, its high tech industries or about
how Forbes and its economists reached their conclusions that
Seattle tops other cities.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Forbes devotes most of the text of its report on ``Best
Places'' to San Diego, which ranked No. 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news on Seattle is out there and we didn't feel
compelled to devote particular text resources to telling people
that Seattle is hot,'' said Tim Ferguson, Forbes' West Coast Bureau
supervisor of the report.
</P>
<P>
   Economists used by Forbes examined statistics compiled by the
Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Census Bureau's Bureau of Economic
Affairs and U.S. government output data through the 1990s, Ferguson
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seattle's preeminence is a reflection of its momentum, its
breadth of technologies it has sustained during its growth and
prosperity during the 1990s,'' Ferguson said.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine also examined average wage and salary increases and
average job growth in high-tech industries in the two most recent
years available ``to catch the most recent momentum,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perry Wong, a Milken Institute research associate who helped
crunch some of the numbers in the study, said the high-tech
industries now reflect the diversity and strength of any region's
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seattle ranked high in all of the growth areas,'' Wong said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The growth in employment in these high technology sectors, the
increase in wages and output reflect the industrial health of the
area. As one sector, such as aerospace, weakens the others are able
to sustain the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Economists most familiar with the Puget Sound region tended to
agree with the findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we really deserve that good reputation,'' said
Washington state Chief Economist Chang Mook Sohn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been noticing and monitoring developments in scientific
technology and in many ways we are way ahead of many parts of the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and other computer software companies in the region,
along with area-based wholesale and retail companies such as
Costco, Nordstrom and Starbucks, ``are all leading-edge companies
and clearly show us the power of being able to offset setbacks by
Boeing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Dick Conway, an economic consultant focused on the Puget
Sound region, had some reservations about the Forbes/Milken
Institute study.
</P>
<P>
   By measuring growth only, the study fails to reflect the actual
size of high tech industries in metropolitan areas, Conway said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it difficult to compare Seattle and Ventura, Calif.,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a relatively small base to begin with, it doesn't
take more than a few things to make things happen. Still, it is
useful to see where and what is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   The rapid growth of Seattle-area computer software companies in
the early 1990s ``kept the region out of recession when Boeing was
having difficulties,'' Conway said.
</P>
<P>
   Other magazines have been ranking the Seattle area at the top or
near the top of numerous lists in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle topped Fortune magazine's ``Best Cities'' lists in 1992
and 1996 and was No. 4 on the magazine's list in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle-area companies such as Microsoft, REI, Eddie Bauer,
Nordstrom and Starbucks also ranked high on Fortune magazine's list
of ``Best places to work'' in 1997.

KNICKS BEAT HAWKS, 100-92 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On Sunday, Allan Houston sprinted defiantly down the
Miami Arena floor and punched his fist into the air after his
dramatic shot eliminated the Heat.
</P>
<P>
   That look of confidence and edge of arrogance did not vanish
over a 48-hour period. It only bubbled up inside of him, and poured
out onto the Atlanta Hawks' Georgia Dome floor. Houston scored a
career-high 34 points on Tuesday night to lead the New York Knicks
to a 100-92 victory in Game 1 of their four-of-seven-game
second-round series and ripped the home-court advantage from the
Hawks' hands.
</P>
<P>
   Showing no signs of overindulging themselves since their victory
over the Heat on Sunday, the Knicks did not need to ride Patrick
Ewing. With Ewing in foul trouble, and resting his weary body on
the bench most of the night, the Knicks leaned on their offensive
twosome, Houston and Latrell Sprewell. They alternated surges.
Sprewell scored 17 of his 31 points in the first half, while
Houston came up with 15 of his points to stop the Hawks' momentum
in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Smith led the Hawks in scoring with 25 points.
</P>
<P>
   Just two days ago, the Knicks were on an emotional high after
Houston's game-winning shot eliminated their bitter rival, the
Miami Heat. There was celebrating and euphoria; and it was a threat
to the Knicks' mental approach entering their game against the
Hawks.
</P>
<P>
   They have no playoff history with the Hawks, no built-in
hostility to draw on, no bitterness lingering from the past. All of
that concerned Coach Jeff Van Gundy, who was less than satisfied
with the Knicks' preparation for this game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our opportunity right now to do something,'' Van Gundy
said before the game. `'You don't waste a minute, you don't waste a
quarter and you certainly can't waste a game to get right because
of something you did 48 hours ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks did not seem like a team ready for a mental meltdown
at the start of the game. It was after they built an 11-point lead
with 7:40 left in the first half when the trouble began, and it
ended with the Hawks hitting three consecutive 3-pointers to go
ahead, 50-48, at the half.
</P>
<P>
   Just when the Knicks were teetering on losing interest in the
game, Houston came forward and scored 15 third-quarter points to
pull the Knicks out of a temporary funk and an 8-point deficit and
help them take a 80-73 lead after the third period.
</P>
<P>
   This after the Hawks came out of the halftime break and turned
to Smith. He was just 2 for 8 in the first half, but he had a hair
more focus and determination as he reeled off 7 straight points and
helped put the Hawks ahead, 60-52, with 9:01 left in the third.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks have had trouble during the third period all season.
But this time, they showed resolve as they charged right back by
abusing the matchup of Smith on Kurt Thomas. Smith, who had picked
up four fouls early in the third, briefly moved off of Houston and
guarded Thomas. Two jumpers later, Thomas had scored 4 points on
the Knicks' 8-0 run to tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after Smith missed a jumper, the Knicks ran down the floor
and Houston found Charlie Ward on the perimeter open for a
3-pointer that gave New York a 65-62 lead with 5:08 left in the
third. The Knicks' run extended to 12-4 after a jumper by Houston
fell with 2:30 left.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the game, the Knicks went up and they came down with
Sprewell. In the first half, he nailed contorted runners, baseline
jumpers and drove for layups without fear of Dikembe Mutombo.
Scoring 17 points in his first 12 minutes on the floor, he was
electric.
</P>
<P>
   His lethargic defense, though, gave the Hawks a chance to bolt
back into this game. His man, Chris Crawford, became the unlikely
source of offense for a Hawks team that watched Smith miss six of
his first seven shots and get into foul trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Once Sprewell began to miss, the Hawks capitalized. Sprewell was
late in getting back to defend as Crawford hit two of the Hawks'
three consecutive 3-pointers. Crawford, who scored 20 first-half
points, fed a 14-2 run that was ripped off in just 3:10.
</P>
<P>
   The run was punctuated with a 3-pointer from Crawford with 2:38
left in the first half, a shot that gave the Hawks a lightening
quick 48-46 lead.
</P>
<P>
   All the Knicks had done to shake off their Miami hangover was
erased by the unassuming Crawford. It didn't matter that the Knicks
were shredding the Hawks' stiff defense by hitting 50 percent of
their shots in the first half. It didn't matter that the Knicks had
done their damage with Ewing sitting out much of the first half
with foul trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks led at the half by 2 after making 6 for 12 from
3-point range.

E TO TARGET `LEGAL ARISTOCRATS' AS FACTOR IN SOCIAL DECLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KRIS MAYES  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former Vice President Dan Quayle will try to reignite the
political debate over morality Wednesday by taking a slap at
``legal aristocrats'' and ``child rights zealots'' he says are
partly to blame for a degeneration of American culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legal aristocracy has got to be held accountable,'' Quayle
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech before the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco
Wednesday, Quayle will lambaste specific groups of legal activists
for encouraging lawsuits against parents and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand we want parental accountability and on the
other hand we want children to sue their parents,'' he said. ``It's
crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Educators, too, are intimidated by the legal climate, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teachers are afraid of lawsuits if they have discipline,'' he
asserted.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle will also accuse federal judges of blocking Americans
from fully practicing their religious faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (lawyers and judges) have undermined the core elements of
our society,'' he said, adding that he plans to ``shake that crowd
up a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   In the address, Quayle will return to familiar political
terrain.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1992 speech entitled ``The Poverty of Values,'' Quayle
excoriated the TV sitcom character Murphy Brown for being part of
an entertainment climate that accepted, even glamorized, single
motherhood.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's speech, on the seven-year anniversary of that talk,
will be delivered in the same location.
</P>
<P>
   The 1992 talk sparked a furious debate among conservatives,
academics and entertainers about the legitimacy of blaming
television for societal ills, and later, about the propriety of
single parenthood itself.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Quayle will blast federal judges and such groups as
the American Civil Liberties Union for, in his view, preventing
Americans from practicing their faith in public places such as
schools and courtrooms by coming down too hard on the separation of
church and state.
</P>
<P>
   And he will cite the aftermath of the shootings at Columbine
High School in Littleton, Colo., where, according to Quayle,
families and teachers pulled together through prayer but are
ironically foreclosed from praying in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an indictment of the legal system as opposed to the
entertainment community this time around,'' said Quayle's media
adviser Fred Davis, who helped craft the speech.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle and his wife, Marilyn, are lawyers, which gives them room
to speak, said Quayle's press secretary, Jonathan Baron.
</P>
<P>
   While Quayle is not likely to dwell on the Murphy Brown episode,
his staff has billed the address as the sequel to a blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sparked the political debate which has dominated the
decade,'' Baron said, referring to the Murphy Brown speech. ``Dan
Quayle won the debate over the debate and the next step is winning
the actual battle over the culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle said he's not worried about appearing too harsh by
targeting specific organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ordinary suspects may not like it, but tough,'' Quayle
said. ``But the average American will. And teachers will.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not say he is trying to convey he is more conservative
than his fellow GOP candidates, but did remark, ``I'm not sure how
many other people could or would make this speech that I'm going to
make.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Quayle reaches too far right, he risks being cut off from
centrist voters, one political observer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still trying to corral the religious right and trying to
expand it,'' said Richard Pious, professor of political science at
Columbia University. ``But the more religious it is the more he's
got to worry that he's going to alienate the base.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle may also be looking for a boost out of a political
morass.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign raised more than $2 million in the first quarter of
the primary election cycle, but ended the quarter in debt.
</P>
<P>
   And only 6 percent of Republicans supported him for their
party's nomination in a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll released early
this month.
</P>
<P>
   That gave him a tie with billionaire Steve Forbes, but left him
far behind former Red Cross President Elizabeth Dole and the
front-runner, Texas. Gov. George W. Bush, who logged 42 percent.

ARIZONA IS WORST IN HEALTH COVERAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MAUREEN WEST  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRESCOTT, Ariz. _ The portion of Arizonans who don't have
medical insurance has grown to 28 percent, ranking Arizona worst in
the nation for uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   And some participants at 74th Arizona Town Hall on future health
care in Arizona say they hope the statistic will spark political
attention to the problem. The 150 participants are in Prescott for
the four-day event.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it was bad when 15 to 17 percent of Arizonans were
uninsured,'' said Dr. Scott Gorman of Phoenix, interim executive
director of Mayo Health Plan Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can only hope it is now finally on the radar screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Participants learned that uninsured Arizonans don't have access
to preventive medicine. They wait until their condition is acute,
then go to a hospital emergency room for treatment. In most Arizona
towns and cities, the emergency rooms are seriously overcrowded.
And an increasing flow of illegal immigration is also adding to the
ranks of the uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing a real influx of undocumented people into the
state now,'' said Lee Knaeble, a Hereford business owner who is on
the Sierra Vista Community Hospital Board.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could mean more people showing up at emergency rooms
because that is the only way they can access health care.''
</P>
<P>
   But the real problem isn't immigration, said many at the Town
Hall. It's unaffordable health care.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Groseta of Cottonwood, a third-generation cattle rancher
and chairman of the board of Northern Arizona Health Care, said
most of the workers in managerial positions at large ranches and
farms had insurance 10 to 15 years ago. Now, fewer than 50 percent
do. Even fewer ranch and farm hands have it, and their work is more
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Tempe resident Ron Lee, executive director of the Arizona
Commission on Indian Affairs, agreed that workplace health
insurance is where the system is failing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arizona has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the
U.S.,'' he said. ``How can we have one of the highest rates of
uninsured?''
</P>
<P>
   The growth of low-paying service-sector jobs is seen as the
basic factor driving the health insurance crisis. Also, the rise of
contract work is pushing many people who work full time out of
insurance plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This goes all the way up to the banking industry,'' Groseta
said. ``We have to do something soon: More people are falling off
the insurance wagon every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Groseta believes legislation providing tax and other incentives
for employers to provide insurance plans to more workers is needed.
</P>
<P>
   So are insurance pools where the uninsured or underinsured could
buy affordable insurance as part of a group, participants said.
</P>
<P>
   Some agreed more money needs to be directed toward preventive
care. A system of community clinics, providing preventive care on a
walk-in basis, is seen by some as a needed step in repairing
Arizona's public health conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Among other recommendations being discussed is a call to the
Legislature to allow more people to participate in the Arizona
Health Care Cost Containment System, or AHCCCS. Raising the
eligibility level for AHCCCS to 200 percent of the poverty rate
would allow more working poor to be covered by health insurance,
some believe.
</P>
<P>
   Because Arizona's elderly population is expected to double
during the next 30 years, a system of preventive care would help
keep older people healthier, so that their final years will not be
characterized by expensive chronic diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Weisbuch, director of the Maricopa County Public Health
Department, said that old age is not necessarily a time of
expensive health care, if preventive medicine has been available
consistently through a person's life. Yet only 2 percent of money
spent nationally on health care every year is spent on prevention,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other participants argued for the better use of affordable
alternative therapies that have proved effective but are not paid
for by insurance.
</P>
<P>
   This is the third Town Hall in the past 16 years to look at
health care in Arizona, said Shirley Agnos, Arizona Town Hall
president. While the subject of health care in Arizona keeps
popping up, the nature of the discussion has changed, she added.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, before many Arizonans were enrolled in HMOs,
employers and their insurers were at the mercy of medical
providers, who were continually raising prices. The rise of health
maintenance organizations shifted the debate: It became employee
and employer against the HMO, and the HMO against the hospital and
doctor.
</P>
<P>
   At a 1993 Town Hall on health care, Arizonans were expecting the
Clinton administration to produce some form of national health
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Lonnie Hurst was at the Arizona Town Hall on health in the
1980s. At that time, only a few people understood the complicated
health issues, he said. This is a more educated crowd, in part
because of the Clinton health care debate. He believes there is
less finger-pointing than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The Town Hall wraps up Wednesday with the approval of public
policy recommendations that will be sent to legislators, the
governor and the media. &QL;

ANALYSTS PREDICT MORE THAN $40 MILLION FOR `PHANTOM
MENACE'  OPENING
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Movie industry analysts didn't need to wait for
the 12:01 a.m. showings of ``Star Wars: Episode 1 _ The Phantom
Menace'' to declare it the biggest opening ever, by far.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts predicted that ``Phantom Menace'' will generate more
than $40 million in gross ticket revenue Wednesday, and might come
close to doubling the previous one-day record of $26.1 million set
by ``The Lost World: Jurassic Park'' two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's safe to say that it will do $42 million to $45 million on
the first day,'' said Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel
Source forecasting service. ``That's pretty safe to predict because
we've been hearing reports the advance sales were between $25
million and $30 million for the first week.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Barry Hyman, an analyst with Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum:
``I could see a first-day total of over $40 million as quite
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The prequel was slated to open at about 2,950 theaters, most of
which scheduled 12:01 a.m. showings. Bucksbaum's calculations are
based on averages of 500 seats per theater, a $4.95 average
admission price, seven showings per screen and most of the shows
selling out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are clearly a lot of people who are taking the day off
to see it and a lot of kids who are not going to go to school,''
Bucksbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 12:01 a.m. shows in the San Fernando and Santa
Clarita valleys north of Los Angeles were sold out, along with most
of Wednesday's early evening screenings. As of Tuesday afternoon,
some 10 p.m. shows also were sold out, including those at Mann's
Chinese in Hollywood and the Universal City Cineplex.
</P>
<P>
   The records should continue to be set through the first week of
the film, breaking the $104.9 million mark set by ``Lost World.''
Bucksbaum believes ``Phantom Menace'' will have hit $130 million
after the first five days, while Hyman forecasts a five-day
domestic gross of $100 million to $130 million.
</P>
<P>
   The trackers agree that the core audience of adolescent boys and
young adult males will see the movie again and again during the
first few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Skislock of Laguna Research Partners believes the final
domestic take will beat the $461 million taken in by the original
``Star Wars,'' which includes $140 million from the 1997
re-release.
</P>
<P>
   `` `The Phantom Menace' is going to do exceptionally well
because everyone wants to take their own first look and make their
own judgment in the first week or two,'' Skislock said. ``I think
it has a very good shot at breaking the `Star Wars' domestic record
because we now have a multigenerational audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Others aren't so certain, given less-than-stellar reviews and
the chance that some moviegoers may have been turned off by months
of hype. Most forecasts have been scaled back recently, placing
``Phantom Menace'' between $300 million to $450 million _
spectacular, since that threshold has been crossed by only eight
films, but far short of ``Titanic's'' $601 million record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will do $300 million to $350 million, which is very
impressive,'' Hyman said. ``There will be millions of kids 10 to 15
who will go see it more than once but they won't be paying the full
price. (But) it will completely dominate the first couple of
weekends.''
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum has downgraded his forecast from $475 million to $410
million to a range of $375 million to $410 million, citing the
tendency of blockbusters opening in late May to fade quickly. In
the past three years, ``Mission: Impossible,'' ``The Lost World''
and ``Godzilla'' all opened strongly, then dropped more than 50
percent in their second weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Those movies opened in the week before Memorial Day weekend,
however. By opening Wednesday, ``Phantom Menace'' essentially gets
two long weekends _ including next weekend's three-day Memorial Day
weekend _ with very little competition from the other major
studios.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bucksbaum said that by mid-June, the ``Phantom Menace''
box office will be waning, especially in the face of New Line's
``Austin Powers: the Spy Who Shagged Me,'' which will open June 11,
and Warner Bros.' ``Wild Wild West,'' which will open June 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone who wants to see `Phantom Menace' will see it in the
first five days,'' Bucksbaum said. ``The core audience wants to see
it now but the question is, are they going to like it enough to see
it over and over and over? The people in the lines say they will
but they're also looking forward to seeing the other movies when
they come out.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros., in a show of confidence that ``Phantom Menace''
will have stopped dominating once it's been out for a month,
recently announced it was moving ``Wild Wild West'' up two days so
it will open on a Wednesday at about 3,000 theaters. Bucksbaum
believes the Will Smith vehicle will be the summer's No. 2 film at
$185 million, followed by ``Austin Powers'' at $160 million.
</P>
<P>
   20th Century Fox and George Lucas originally demanded that
theaters book ``Phantom Menace'' for at least eight weeks in their
largest auditoriums, but Bucksbaum said several chains have been
able to limit the runs to a month due to the strength of upcoming
product, including Universal's ``Notting Hill'' on May 28, Disney's
``Tarzan'' and Paramount's ``General's Daughter'' on June 18,
Sony's ``Big Daddy'' on June 25 and Paramount's ``South Park'' on
June 30.
</P>
<P>
   However, Fox and Lucas stuck to their demand that ``Phantom
Menace'' run only in theaters with digital sound, Bucksbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the near future, Hyman believes ``Phantom Menace'' can
take in $500 million to $550 million in overseas markets, where
poor reviews have less effect. Preproduction is expected to begin
later this year for ``Episode 2,'' to be released in 2002, and
Lucas hopes to release ``Episode 3'' in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   ```Phantom Menace' is really the first of a triad that could
bring in $2 billion globally,'' Hyman said. ``It's going to make
Lucas even more wealthy.''

LONG BEACH ST. ACE GALLO IS MOUND OF ANGER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'd like to introduce you to two fellows on Dave Snow's Long
Beach State baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   First, there's Mike Gallo. He's a senior left-handed starting
pitcher, the ace of Snow's staff and the Big West's pitcher of the
year. Mike is 10-2, has a 2.13 earned run average, and has held
opposing batters to a .247 average, which is several leagues below
sea level in the college baseball world. He'll start one of the
three games the Dirtbags play this week at Blair Field against No.
1-ranked Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Pepe. He's the guy in the Dirtbag dugout moving at
the speed of Taz, talking up his teammates, razing opponents,
chatting with fans. When time calls for rally caps or deuces, Pepe
is at the forefront of the assembly. He's a collegiate baseball bon
vivant.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Snow likes both guys immensely. The only thing that worries
him is the possibility of asking Mike Gallo to pitch and Pepe
somehow getting the ball.
</P>
<P>
   By now you've realized that Mike Gallo and Pepe are one and the
same, a bonus baby with two separate but integral spirits rolled
into one.
</P>
<P>
   Gallo the pitcher is the epitome of what anyone would want on a
team. He's tough, competitive and courageous. ``When Mike is on the
mound, the team knows it has a shot to win,'' said his catcher,
Bryan Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Pepe the team captain is a wild and crazy guy, the epitome of
Dirtbag spirit and confidence, characteristics that turns
individuals into a team. ``It's tougher than pitching,'' Pepe said.
``I get so into the games. I can't sit still. I was already amped
to pitched Sunday by Saturday night.''
</P>
<P>
   It will surprise you not in the least then to know that the 49er
coaches are told to make sure Gallo stays away from candies and
sweets 24 hours before he pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``My outlook on life is to live it to the fullest,'' said Pepe.
``I can't be mean to people. I treat everyone as my a best friend
until I figure out what they're like. I don't want enemies. I want
everyone to like me as a person and as a player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gosh, baseball, it's just a game. Guys get paid to play this
game? Amazing. I'd play for a penny.''
</P>
<P>
   Once you give him that penny and hand him the ball, he becomes
Mike Gallo.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm on the mound, I'm a different person, an angry
person,'' said Gallo. ``Whoever steps into the batters box is my
enemy. It could be my dad, and I'd want to make him look stupid.
Before games, I can be a real jerk, and you do not want to face me.
</P>
<P>
   ``But after games? Those guys are my best friends. That's one
thing I like about college baseball. You get to know the guys you
play against.''
</P>
<P>
   Take Sunday's 15-3 win against Fullerton for example. When the
two teams met for postgame handshakes, Gallo was conspicuous in the
way he shook each hand firmly. He even hugged some of the Titans.
One of the huggee's was Ryan Owens, who bombed Gallo twice for solo
home runs. ``I told him he owed me dinner,'' said Gallo.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers owe Gallo a lot. Their trip to Omaha for the College
World Series last season came at the same time that Gallo matured
as a pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Gallo threw a complete game shutout of Fullerton in the Big West
tournament, then beat Stanford 5-1 in the Western regional to get
to Omaha. He made two CWS starts against Miami, holding the
hard-hitting 'Canes to three runs each time. His 10 wins this
season include two versus Fullerton and one against defending NCAA
champ USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a high-energy guy, very competitive,'' said Snow of
Gallo. ``The big task was getting him turned into a bonafide
pitcher, channeling that energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``His emotions used to work against him. The ball would take
off, he wouldn't have any command. Late last year, he started
making it a positive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach has done a great job keeping me at mid-level, not too
pumped up,'' said Gallo. ``He knows how to deal with whatever
personality a guy has. And the skills he teaches you are life
skills, whether you're playing baseball or working a desk job.
Outside of my parents, he's been the most influential person in my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Snow gave Gallo his nickname. It came in 1997, Gallo's first
season as a 49er, after Snow got a look at Gallo's hyperactive
ways. The name has two roots depending on who tells the story: He
was named Pepe because he was always peppy, or because one of the
Gallo winemakers allegedly was named Pepe.
</P>
<P>
   A running joke during 1997 practice sessions would have Snow
asking Gallo, who was always running around the field doing
something, for the location of a blue ball bag. ``Pepe, got that
blue ball bag?''
</P>
<P>
   ``He loves Pepe when he's not pitching,'' said Gallo with a
laugh. ``He likes messing with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallo played for Dan Peters' perennially successful program at
Long Beach Millikan High School, but he mostly played right field.
He pitched only 26 innings as a senior on a staff that included
Nick Bierbrodt and Eric Ireland. Bierbrodt was a first-round draft
pick by Arizona and is now pitching AA, and Ireland is expected to
jump to to Houston's AA team this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Gallo, whose mom is a concessions supervisor at Los Alamitos
Race Track and whose dad works in advertising (he once worked at
the Press Telegram), chose to attend Long Beach City College after
high school so he could continue to play baseball and start work on
a communications degree, with an eventual goal of becoming a
sportscaster.
</P>
<P>
   It was there that Viking coach Casey Crook suggested Gallo
become a full-time pitcher. ``He took the bat out of my hand. He
said I had a strong arm and that it happened to be my left arm, and
that those two things could get me into the pros a lot quicker than
a stick,'' said Gallo.
</P>
<P>
   Gallo was named the Vikings' player of the year. ``I learned my
good mechanics (at LBCC),'' Gallo said. ``But all I had was a
fastball, curve and a weak change. The curve was pretty weak, too.
What got me through was good movement and hitting spots. But I was
basically a thrower. I didn't grasp the concept of pitching until I
got to Long Beach State.''
</P>
<P>
   Snow used Gallo exclusively as a spot reliever his first season,
working him 21 fr 1/3 innings in 22 appearances, mostly against
left-handed hitters. ``I accepted that role, but I never got
comfortable with it,'' Gallo said.
</P>
<P>
   He relieved for half of 1998 before moving into the rotation. By
then, he had developed a slider -- ``It's been so money for me'' --
and improved his changeup.
</P>
<P>
   After the College World Series, Gallo spent the offseason
working to get in better shape and gaining more command of his
pitches. He knew he would need one more season of college work
before he would have any pro draft potential, and at 10-2, he's had
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is all this a shock? Not really,'' Gallo said. ``It was always
my dream to be the best in whatever I do. I set a goal for myself
before the season to be the best pitcher in the nation. I've never
taken anything for granted, and I approach every game as if it will
be my last.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that's a roof,'' said Gallo. Or maybe it was Pepe.

million and $30 million for the first week.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Barry Hyman, an analyst with Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum:
``I could see a first-day total of over $40 million as quite
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The prequel was slated to open at about 2,950 theaters, most of
which scheduled 12:01 a.m. showings. Bucksbaum's calculations are
based on averages of 500 seats per theater, a $4.95 average
admission price, seven showings per screen and most of the shows
selling out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are clearly a lot of people who are taking the day off
to see it and a lot of kids who are not going to go to school,''
Bucksbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 12:01 a.m. shows in the San Fernando and Santa
Clarita valleys north of Los Angeles were sold out, along with most
of Wednesday's early evening screenings. As of Tuesday afternoon,
some 10 p.m. shows also were sold out, including those at Mann's
Chinese in Hollywood and the Universal City Cineplex.
</P>
<P>
   The records should continue to be set through the first week of
the film, breaking the $104.9 million mark set by ``Lost World.''
Bucksbaum believes ``Phantom Menace'' will have hit $130 million
after the first five days, while Hyman forecasts a five-day
domestic gross of $100 million to $130 million.
</P>
<P>
   The trackers agree that the core audience of adolescent boys and
young adult males will see the movie again and again during the
first few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Skislock of Laguna Research Partners believes the final
domestic take will beat the $461 million taken in by the original
``Star Wars,'' which includes $140 million from the 1997
re-release.
</P>
<P>
   `` `The Phantom Menace' is going to do exceptionally well
because everyone wants to take their own first look and make their
own judgment in the first week or two,'' Skislock said. ``I think
it has a very good shot at breaking the `Star Wars' domestic record
because we now have a multigenerational audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Others aren't so certain, given less-than-stellar reviews and
the chance that some moviegoers may have been turned off by months
of hype. Most forecasts have been scaled back recently, placing
``Phantom Menace'' between $300 million to $450 million _
spectacular, since that threshold has been crossed by only eight
films, but far short of ``Titanic's'' $601 million record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will do $300 million to $350 million, which is very
impressive,'' Hyman said. ``There will be millions of kids 10 to 15
who will go see it more than once but they won't be paying the full
price. (But) it will completely dominate the first couple of
weekends.''
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum has downgraded his forecast from $475 million to $410
million to a range of $375 million to $410 million, citing the
tendency of blockbusters opening in late May to fade quickly. In
the past three years, ``Mission: Impossible,'' ``The Lost World''
and ``Godzilla'' all opened strongly, then dropped more than 50
percent in their second weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Those movies opened in the week before Memorial Day weekend,
however. By opening Wednesday, ``Phantom Menace'' essentially gets
two long weekends _ including next weekend's three-day Memorial Day
weekend _ with very little competition from the other major
studios.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bucksbaum said that by mid-June, the ``Phantom Menace''
box office will be waning, especially in the face of New Line's
``Austin Powers: the Spy Who Shagged Me,'' which will open June 11,
and Warner Bros.' ``Wild Wild West,'' which will open June 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone who wants to see `Phantom Menace' will see it in the
first five days,'' Bucksbaum said. ``The core audience wants to see
it now but the question is, are they going to like it enough to see
it over and over and over? The people in the lines say they will
but they're also looking forward to seeing the other movies when
they come out.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros., in a show of confidence that ``Phantom Menace''
will have stopped dominating once it's been out for a month,
recently announced it was moving ``Wild Wild West'' up two days so
it will open on a Wednesday at about 3,000 theaters. Bucksbaum
believes the Will Smith vehicle will be the summer's No. 2 film at
$185 million, followed by ``Austin Powers'' at $160 million.
</P>
<P>
   20th Century Fox and George Lucas originally demanded that
theaters book ``Phantom Menace'' for at least eight weeks in their
largest auditoriums, but Bucksbaum said several chains have been
able to limit the runs to a month due to the strength of upcoming
product, including Universal's ``Notting Hill'' on May 28, Disney's
``Tarzan'' and Paramount's ``General's Daughter'' on June 18,
Sony's ``Big Daddy'' on June 25 and Paramount's ``South Park'' on
June 30.
</P>
<P>
   However, Fox and Lucas stuck to their demand that ``Phantom
Menace'' run only in theaters with digital sound, Bucksbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the near future, Hyman believes ``Phantom Menace'' can
take in $500 million to $550 million in overseas markets, where
poor reviews have less effect. Preproduction is expected to begin
later this year for ``Episode 2,'' to be released in 2002, and
Lucas hopes to release ``Episode 3'' in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   ```Phantom Menace' is really the first of a triad that could
bring in $2 billion globally,'' Hyman said. ``It's going to make
Lucas even more wealthy.''

SPORTS COLUMN: VAN GUNDY HAS EARNED A NEW TERM 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Like jets stacked up in a holding pattern, everybody
is waiting, waiting, waiting, to see what happens with the Knicks.
Nobody can go anywhere until they stop performing their erratic
loop-the-loops.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of this backup is Jeff Van Gundy, the current coach of
the Knicks and, if there is any justice in this world, the future
coach, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks are not going anywhere for a while. They began their
four-of-seven-game series on Tuuesday night in the looming Georgia
Dome, and outran the weary outmanned Hawks,100-92, in what could be
a rewarding war of attrition. The Knicks' season now goes at least
until Wednesday, and quite likely well beyond. In the meantime,
everybody's doing circles over some generic Allentown.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches, general managers, agents, players, real-estate agents,
moving companies, everybody is dependent on how it all turns out
with these accidental tourists of the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   Where is Phil Jackson going? Who coaches the Lakers? Will Don
Casey, another respected lifer, get the shot he earned with the
Nets? Would Patrick Ewing really go home to play for Washington
rather than play for Jackson? It sounds like fun, messing up
everybody's plans.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy looked like a goner a month ago with the Knicks
playing without a flight plan. But they won six of their last eight
games to qualify for the playoffs, and then defeated Miami by the
capricious roll of a soft sweet shot by Allan Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes life is like that. The Knicks have eliminated Pat
Riley, the designated archenemy at the top of the chain of command,
and that is worth something. But Van Gundy's track record is longer
and more substantial than one lucky roll.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since he came in as an assistant under Stu Jackson a full
10 years ago, Van Gundy has been an astute observer. The hard work
_ tossing a million passes to John Starks in practice _ is a given.
Van Gundy also learned stuff from John MacLeod, Riley and Don
Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   It was Nelson, during his short and weird regime, who was asked
by Charlie Rose where the next generation of great coaches were.
Nelson told an incredulous Rose that he had one on his staff.
Nelson did not last a season, and Van Gundy got the job, and he has
taken the Knicks into the second round all four years.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching the second round should get Van Gundy a contract
extension. Yes, the Knicks were dreadful to watch most of this
short season, but then again, so was the whole league. It's not
much fun watching millionaires exercise, is it? Or, as the fan
shouted as he emerged from the Garden last Friday, ``I paid 90
bucks for this?''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the Knicks regrouped in Miami on Sunday. This was the
team Ernie Grunfeld built _ with Marcus Camby providing a jolt of
energy, and Latrell Sprewell leading the Knicks in scoring in the
first round, and flicking the ball away from Tim Hardaway for the
winning possession.
</P>
<P>
   Grunfeld is back in New Jersey, the victim of a late-season
purge by Dave Checketts. Grunfeld and Van Gundy were not on the
same page, so the general manager was dropped. It's not a credit to
anybody that they could not work it out.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy has his flaws, particularly a creaky halfcourt offense
as well as underestimating Buck Williams last year, leading to
Buck's retirement. He is the latest in a long line of coaches
unable to spark any imagination in Ewing's game, but, far more
important, Van Gundy has Ewing's total loyalty and respect, which
led to Ewing's courageous stand last Sunday in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever it is who owns Madison Square Garden must be sure to
really know Jeff Van Gundy before making a gesture toward a big
name to be blared all over the air waves. (I think the current
bunch has something to do with television.)
</P>
<P>
   The new owners must recognize that Van Gundy is not only one of
the most intelligent coaches (he was accepted to Yale, a magna cum
laude graduate of Nazareth College) but also a man of character.
</P>
<P>
   Before this past Friday's game in the Garden, Van Gundy found
time to thank a patron who has been paying for the same expensive
seat as long as Van Gundy has been working there.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by fellow patrons what the conversation had been about,
the fan blurted, ``I think Jeff just said goodbye.'' But then the
Knicks stunned the Rileys and reached the second round. Van Gundy
should have earned an extension. Everybody else spins in circles. &QL;

U.S., CANADA WARN OF DELAYS, HAVOC THAT BORDER LAW WOULD CREATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY AND MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Congestion at the Canadian border regularly results in hours of
delays, and it will get even worse with severe impacts on trade and
tourism unless Congress gets rid of a controversial immigration
requirement, U.S. and Canadian officials warned yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Delays at the crossing at Blaine could reach 12 hours or more if
Section 110 of the 1996 Immigration Act is ever enforced, experts
told the Cascadia Mayors Conference recently.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's warnings came in a letter to Congress from Seattle
Mayor Paul Schell and other U.S. and Canadian mayors, and in a
Washington, D.C., news conference held by Canada's ambassador to
the United States and other senior officials.
</P>
<P>
   Section 110 would, in essence, require that U.S.-bound Canadians
get out of their cars and offer proof of identity, as well as stop
and formally check out of the United States when they head north
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ability to travel within the region is a critical
prerequisite for greater cooperation and coordination,'' said the
letter, signed by Schell, Victoria, B.C., Mayor Bob Cross and
Bellingham Mayor Mark Asmundson on behalf of 21 mayors in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   ``All Cascadia cities would be negatively impacted by this
requirement,'' they wrote to senior members of the Senate and House
judiciary committees.
</P>
<P>
   The computerized alien identification program was scheduled to
go into effect last October. But Congress voted to delay
implementation of Section 110 until March 30, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a deadline that has been extended until 2001 but we
have to make sure that the issue remains alive and hopefully
resolved in 1999. It seems to be generally recognized that if we
wait too long, it might be even more difficult in 2000,'' Raymond
Chretien, Canada's ambassador to the United States, said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., has introduced a bill to repeal
Section 110. The measure has 25 co-sponsors, including Sens. Patty
Murray, D-Wash., and Slade Gorton, R-Wash. No action has been taken
this year although the Senate voted twice last year for repeal.
</P>
<P>
   Repeal has been blocked in Congress' lower chamber by the House
Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Section 110 has an influential defender in Rep. Lamar Smith,
R-Texas, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee's immigration
subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent hearing, Smith argued that identification is needed
to counter the upsurge in organized smuggling of illegal immigrants
across the 4,000-mile border with Canada, and the surge in
marijuana traffic from British Columbia into the United State.
</P>
<P>
   But at the Washington, D.C., news conference yesterday, Abraham
argued that the border checks would not work. Along with five
checkpoints in northwest Washington, the bridges and tunnel linking
Detroit with Windsor, Ontario, are the most heavily traveled
crossings along the U.S.-Canada border.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be very expensive, it will cause huge economic
problems and lost jobs,'' Abraham said. ``I don't think that any of
the alleged benefits of it will be realized, because there is no
way that anybody who has come forward has demonstrated that this
system can work ... to address any of the purported problems it is
supposed to address.''
</P>
<P>
   Implementation of Section 110 ``would effectively close the
borders,'' Jim Kohnke, an executive with Totem Ocean Trailer
Express, told Northwest mayors at a meeting in Victoria, B.C.,
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Canada do more than $1 billion worth of
business across the border each day. Even with the Canadian
dollar's drop in value, Whatcom County takes in $500 million each
year from north-of-the-border visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Border crossing delays has been a major issue in the region.
Last year, the Bellingham Herald criticized Rep. Jack Metcalf,
R-Wash., for his lethargy in dealing with the threat posed by
Section 110.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 million people go through U.S.-Canada border
checkpoints each year, Canada's revenue minister Herb Dhaliwal
noted yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, with the limited resources we have, it would be
impossible to create new infrastructures and new facilities to deal
with such an onerous task as having everyone report,'' said
Dhaliwal, a member of Canada's parliament from Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Even without Section 110, the mayors wrote yesterday, ``We often
face serious delays in crossing the U.S.-Canadian border under
current U.S. procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayors appealed for additional inspectors from the
Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Customs Service to
address ``the backlogs and delays that already exist.''

ZEDILLO'S FAVORITE WILL TRY TO SUCCEED HIM IN MEXICO 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MICHAEL RILEY 
and DUDLEY ALTHAUS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ A day after Mexico's long-ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party adopted sweeping reforms in the way it selects
its presidential candidate, the man widely believed to be President
Ernesto Zedillo's choice as successor formally jumped into the
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am taking the most important decision of my life,'' Interior
Minister Francisco Labastida Ochoa said in a packed hotel ballroom
Tuesday. ``I've decided to present my candidacy for president of
the republic.''
</P>
<P>
   In perhaps the most dramatic effort yet to transform itself from
what once was called ``the perfect dictatorship,'' the PRI's
leadership on Monday approved plans to choose its nominee for next
year's presidential race in an open primary Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules adopted by party leaders, any registered voter
can take part in the secret, nationwide balloting. The candidate
who wins in the largest number of 300 electoral districts will be
the party's nominee.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the past seven decades, the PRI presidential
candidate has been tapped by the sitting president and has gone on
to win in national elections. The party has controlled the
presidency since 1929.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida is one of four serious contenders for the PRI
candidacy. The others are Tabasco Gov. Roberto Madrazo; Manuel
Bartlett, a hard-line former Interior minister and state governor;
and Veracruz Gov. Miguel Aleman.
</P>
<P>
   Although Labastida is considered the favorite of Zedillo, he
faces strong challenges from the other three candidates. Madrazo
and Bartlett, both tied to ruling-party hard-liners, have been
blitzing the airwaves with political ads for weeks, and Madrazo has
surged in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   According to the rules governing the primary, the PRI's
presidential hopefuls must resign or take a leave of absence from
government positions by June 15. Labastida said Tuesday that he has
tendered his resignation as Interior minister without indicating
when it will take effect.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate who wins the PRI's nomination will likely face
Guanajuato Gov. Vicente Fox of the center-right National Action
Party and left-leaning Mexico City Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas in the
July 2000 presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   A poll released Tuesday by Indemerc Louis Harris polling firm
puts Fox ahead of Cardenas and all the announced PRI contenders
except Madrazo, against whom he's running 5 percentage points
behind.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI's new presidential primary ends a long tradition in
which a sitting president, who also served as the ruling party's de
facto leader, hand-picked his own successor. While that process,
known as the dedazo, or ``big finger,'' lacked democratic niceties,
it kept the succession process under control and the party's
internal rivalries under wraps.
</P>
<P>
   But the PRI's grip on power has eroded in the past 12 years.
Many members have deserted to opposition parties, which now control
about a third of Mexico's 31 states as well as Mexico City. The
ruling party lost control of the Congress in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   PRI officials point to the new primary as proof that the PRI is
responding to changes washing across Mexican politics and society.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unity of the party is important, not just for the PRI but
for Mexico,'' said Fernando Solana, a former Education minister and
senator who now holds a top party post. ``Naturally, not everyone
in the party is in agreement with an opening of this nature.''
</P>
<P>
   The primary opens the possibility of an all-out fight among
competing factions, which often have had little in common except
the party name. But analysts say the primary also represents the
PRI's best hope for holding onto power.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just having the primary. It convinces people that the
party is really changing,'' said Gabriel Gonzalez, director of
Americas-Mexico, a political consulting firm that works closely
with the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   With suspicions running high that any revision of the nomination
process would be more show than real, analysts said the PRI had
little alternative but to profoundly change it.
</P>
<P>
   Its clear that party mandarins went out of their way to ensure
that there would be little room for primary losers to complain
about the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   The requirements for entering the primary _ including the
endorsement of a number of party bosses and rank-and-file members _
are loose enough to include any serious contender. The process will
be overseen by Fernando Gutierrez Barrios, a tough former Interior
minister and state governor widely respected in PRI ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to allay concerns that official favoritism or drug money
could influence the race, PRI leaders said they would set a limit
on primary campaign spending and have a review board track
contributions and their origins.

<P>
   For a party once known for a willingness to steal elections when
necessary, the PRI's sudden option for openness may have more to do
with self-interest than with a new commitment to the democratic
ideal.
</P>
<P>
   Electoral reforms over the last 10 years have all but guaranteed
the end of the PRI's political monopoly, making it virtually
impossible to swing elections through the party machine and
traditional vote-fixing.
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning of Zedillo's term in 1994, the party has
been experimenting with ways to select candidates for state
elections. PRI leaders found that the primaries used in several
gubernatorial elections were successful.
</P>
<P>
   Still, rules for the new primary also bear the signs of
presidential influence, which could tilt the outcome to insiders
like Labastida, some analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   The official primary campaign will start in August, and
televised ads will be forbidden until then. That will help
Labastida recover from weak public recognition while hurting
``outsiders'' such as Madrazo, who already have run a flurry of TV
ads.
</P>
<P>
   And because the winner will be determined by electoral district
and not by total vote, the rules may help negate regional strengths
held by such hopefuls as Madrazo or Bartlett. An open vote also
raises the specter that opposition parties could organize members
to vote for the candidate they would prefer to face.
</P>
<P>
   But most observers view the rules as a revolution of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a risk, but democracy entails both risk and
opportunity,'' said Sergio Martinez, director of the Colosio
Foundation, the PRI's think tank.

CONGRESSIONAL GOP MAKING SPENDING CUTS IT ADMITS ARE PAINFUL

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans in Congress completed a plan on Tuesday
to cut domestic spending by tens of billions of dollars next year.
Their leaders warned that it would cause ``sticker shock'' and
political pain. The White House called it ``a blueprint for
political chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   Cutting domestic spending by 11 percent might seem strange at a
time of budget surpluses and economic prosperity. But in 1997,
Congress and the White House agreed to spending caps to force down
federal spending. They are now chafing under the restraints they
embraced.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts will come in spending categories covering education,
job training, housing, health and human services, environmental
protection, medical and technological research, diplomacy and
foreign aid, among other federal programs. These follow $53 billion
in cuts in domestic spending since the Republicans won control of
Congress in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all knew this was going to be painful,'' the House majority
leader, Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Armey said there would be ``sticker shock now in realizing just
how difficult it will be'' to stay within the spending caps.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday morning the House Appropriations Committee will
slice up a $538 billion budget pie _ what is left of the $1.75
trillion budget after paying for mandatory programs like Medicare _
for its 13 subcommittees. Under the committee's plan, the Defense
Department will receive about $270 billion, more than half the
money. Every other government agency would receive an aggregate of
about $268 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's final spending draft for the fiscal year 2000,
which will be formally approved on Wednesday, contains $26.3
billion in cuts for domestic spending, about 11 percent less than
what Congress meted out for this year, and a $18.9 billion increase
for the military, up about 7.5 percent, committee members said.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress are moaning, ```Oh, oh, oh, we can't live up
to that,''' said the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of
Mississippi. ``It's tough, but it ought to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials, along with some Republicans and Democrats
in Congress, warned that the plan could lead to political
confrontation and presidential vetoes. Some predicted a repeat of
last year's spending stalemate, which ended in a frenzied,
last-minute omnibus spending bill larded with $21 billion in
extras. Others remembered the standoff that led to a partial
shutdown of the government in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican budget is a blueprint for chaos,'' said Jacob
J. Lew, the White House budget director. ``These allocations are a
sign of that. They would have unacceptable consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say the caps have shrunk domestic nonmilitary spending
to its smallest share of the national economy since 1962. They also
helped create a budget surplus, but at a cost. Not all Republicans
agree that they still make sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's hardly a member of Congress that doesn't realize the
caps will be lifted,'' said Rep. John Edward Porter of Illinois, a
senior Republican on the Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But lifting the caps could violate promises made by Republican
leaders. It could result in more spending taken from surplus Social
Security funds, and it could blunt Republican plans for tax cuts,
splintering two of the biggest planks in their political platform
for the 2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Porter is one of 13 House Appropriations subcommittee chairmen _
they are called Congress' ``college of cardinals'' _ who will
divide the $538 billion in discretionary spending on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Porter's subcommittee, which oversees labor, education and
health programs, would receive nearly $11 billion less than last
year. The subcommittee overseeing the Veterans Administration and
the Department of Housing and Urban Development would take a $5.8
billion cut; the one overseeing the Commerce, State and Justice
Departments, a $2.8 billion cut; the Interior Department, $2.7
billion; foreign operations, $2.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittees must figure out how to divide their
allocations and pay for their programs under the caps before the
current fiscal year ends next Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, at least, the caps were irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 269 to 158, with 152 Republicans and 117 Democrats
voting in favor, the House on Tuesday night passed an emergency
spending bill of nearly $15 billion, twice what Clinton requested,
financing NATO's air war in Yugoslavia, relief for refugees in
Kosovo and aid for disaster victims in the United States and
Central America, along with billions in military projects.
</P>
<P>
   About $13 billion will come from surplus Social Security funds.
That money is designated as an emergency appropriation, meaning it
does not count under the spending caps. Most of the rest will come
from food stamp and low-income housing funds designated as surplus
and unlikely to be spent this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate will take up the bill on Thursday. The president has
indicated he will sign it.
