   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, May 5:
</P>
<P>
   Tornadoes like the ones that devastated parts of Oklahoma and
Kansas Monday afternoon, killing more than 40 people and
obliterating whole neighborhoods, begin and end in strangeness.
Before they form, the horizon seems to approach, to acquire a
preternatural clarity against the deep black front of the storm.
Houses and trees seem almost to leap into the foreground. And when
the tornado has finally passed, it leaves behind a track that
insists upon its unpredictability, forcing us to consider the knife
edge that divides what was totally destroyed from what was barely
touched.
</P>
<P>
   Tornadoes are utterly localized, and on a night of many
tornadoes, the fear that strikes comes from knowing that you are
out of the worst until you are in it, with no way to know when that
will be. ``Basically, it was a very large black wall that just
moved here,'' was the way one resident of Moore, just south of
Oklahoma City, described Monday's terrible storm. Another elderly
survivor cited the ``big rumble'' she heard as the tornado passed
her home in South Oklahoma City. The twisters were exceptional both
for their size and the time they spent in contact with the ground,
their impact multiplied by hitting in populated areas.
</P>
<P>
   The overpowering sounds of tornadoes cannot be reproduced in any
meaningful way, but the sight of them has been. These latest storm
cells were tracked from high and low by the National Weather
Service, and the funnel clouds were photographed probably hundreds
if not thousands of times. There was a sense that the storm was
occurring right in front of a nationwide audience, and it
undermined once again the persistent naive feeling, which is always
being undermined, that what we can watch so closely we can somehow
control.
</P>
<P>
   Those on the scene know better. They know in fact that the only
way to control your fate when a tornado strikes is to break off
watching and head for the storm cellar. From ``The Wizard of Oz''
to Monday afternoon, we have perpetuated the myth of a kind of
visual coexistence with twisters. But to watch your own tornado is
a little like watching your own funeral. The wonder about Monday's
storm, given its path, is not that so many died but that so many
did not.

DIAMONDBACKS STRUGGLE ON BASES IN LOSS TO REDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BY PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Even though several players said it feels like they
left Phoenix more than a month ago, the Diamondbacks refuse to
offer up this exhaustive and seasonlong 13-game road trip as the
reason for their recent losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   The facts, however, may point in a different direction. By
virtue of their 6-4 loss to Cincinnati Tuesday night, the
Diamondbacks have now lost three in a row, their longest such
streak since opening the season with four losses.
</P>
<P>
   The club's 14-14 record marks the first time since April 19 they
have been at the .500 level.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks left eight runners on base, six of them in
scoring position. They had 12 different at-bats with runners in
scoring position and came through three times.
</P>
<P>
   All the scoring possibilities aside, the Diamondbacks were
caught on the base paths twice Tuesday night. Feats that were
somewhat surprising mostly because base-running mistakes have
become so rare this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are guys who know how to play the game,'' reliever Gregg
Olson said. ``They're pros in every sense of the word. Last year we
made mental mistakes. That's why when you see something like what
happened here, you're kind of shocked. But you know it's because
they were being aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   First, Tony Womack was picked off at first base in the third
inning when the Diamondbacks had runners at first and third with no
outs.
</P>
<P>
   ``My foot slipped getting back,'' Womack said. ``It's not that
he got me. I'm not going to give him that much credit. If my foot
didn't give, I'm in there. As it was, I thought I was safe. But I
wasn't going to argue it.''
</P>
<P>
   Next, in the fifth inning and the score tied at 4, Luis Gonzalez
was thrown out on a bizarre play between third and home.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks actually had runners at second and third with
no outs after Matt Williams, one of the hottest players in the
league, doubled into the left-center field gap.
</P>
<P>
   Williams saw third base coach Brian Butterfield waving Gonzalez,
put his head down and thought he could make third base easily. But
Butterfield had applied the brakes to Gonzalez and Williams drew a
throw at second base from catcher Brian Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The ball trickled away from Reds second baseman Pokey Reese and
Gonzalez took off for home plate. But Reese recovered the ball and
chased Gonzalez down for the out. Williams wound up being stranded
at second and the Reds took the lead the next inning when Barry
Larkin slammed a two-run home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``He decoyed me pretty good,'' Gonzalez said of Reese. ``I think
he thought the ball was farther away from him, too. By the time I
realized he had the ball, I was in no man's land. I was trying to
be aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Butterfield, who sometimes forgets what a veteran group of
players the club has compared to last year, wa amazed at the
response's he received from Gonzalez and Williams after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gonzo came up to me in the dining room and said, ``My bad,' ''
Butterfield said. ``Then a few minutes later, Matty peeks in and
said, `I'm sorry.' I told each they had nothing to apologize for.
We've lost some games in a row now and haven't scored as much as we
would like and guys are just trying to make something happen. Some
of the mistakes that have been made, I have applauded because
they're aggressive and the way to take it to the other team.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting pitcher Omar Daal lost for the third consecutive start
and saw his record dip to 2-3, while his ERA rose to a very
uncharacteristic 3.99. Daal has experienced a slight pain in his
elbow in the days leading up to each of his starts during the past
three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``But tonight, it was the best it's felt in a long time,'' he
said. ``The days I have pitched it hasn't felt bad. It's sometimes
the next few days. But that's not why I have lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the eventual game-winning home run Daal served to
Larkin, his worst offense of the night was a two-run, two-out
single to Reese in the fourth. After a pair of singles to start the
inning, Daal labored hard to strikeout Aaron Boone and Brian
Johnson and had two strikes on Reese before he hit a soft line
drive up the middle off the end of his bat for the two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the one that hurt the most because I was so close to
getting out of the inning,'' Daal said. ``The hit went to where
there was no one.'' &QL;

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, May 5:
</P>
<P>
   Slobodan Milosevic is using the war in Kosovo to try to sabotage
his most formidable political rival, Milo Djukanovic, the president
of Montenegro. Djukanovic has brought economic reform and ethnic
tolerance to his part of Yugoslavia, and calls the ethnic cleansing
in Kosovo ``insane.'' The West should do everything possible to
help him.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Djukanovic's popularity has discouraged Milosevic from
using his Second Army, stationed in Montenegro, to attempt a coup.
Instead he is trying to undermine Djukanovic by creating ethnic
instability and worsening the economic crisis brought on by the
war. Belgrade has driven 70,000 Kosovars into Montenegro, where
they are resented by the Slavic population. It has made Montenegro
into a NATO target by shooting at alliance planes from there.
Although NATO has responded with restraint, each bomb undermines
public support for Djukanovic.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has also tried to use the army to take over
Montenegro's border posts, television transmitters and its main
port _ Yugoslavia's only outlet to the sea. He has replaced
commanders with his loyalists, and brought in troops from Serbia.
So far Djukanovic's police have kept control.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has made the crucial pledge that ships carrying oil
bound for Montenegro will be exempt from the planned embargo on
Serbia. It has also sent Montenegro $10 million, which will help
pay pensions and salaries this month. Congress should approve an
additional $20 million requested by the White House, but more is
urgently needed.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro also needs more aid to help the Kosovars it has taken
in. It has treated them well, but some have now been killed by the
Second Army. If these measures fail to keep up support for
Djukanovic and the army does attempt a coup, NATO ought to
retaliate from the air. NATO should do whatever it can to protect
this democratic enclave from Milosevic.  &QL;

COYOTES' TVERDOVSKY A HEALTHY SCRATCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS AND BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Coyotes defenseman  &UR; Oleg Tverdovsky, who played in all
82 regular-season games and the first six games of the first-round
Stanley Cup playoff series against St. Louis, was a surprising
healthy scratch from Tuesday night's Game 7 with the Blues.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first playoff game Tverdovsky, who had played in 19
straight postseason games, has missed in his five-year career. When
the scratch was announced, the crowd cheered loudly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt our best chance to win the game is with the six
defensemen who will play in front of him,'' General Manager  &UR; Bobby
 &UR; Smith said of Tverdovsky who has had two assists and six penalty
minutes in the series.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes elected to play defensemen  &UR; Teppo Numminen, Jyrki
 &UR; Lumme, Keith Carney, Gerald Diduck, J.J. Daigneault and  &UR; Stan
Neckar. Apparently, the Coyotes thought Neckar would give them a
stronger physical presence.
</P>
<P>
   Tverdovsky will be a restricted Group II free agent at season's
end. He was a restricted free agent two years ago and took part in
a protracted contract holdout that limited his season 46 games.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was asked if he thought the decision to sit Tverdovsky
will affect his desire to return to Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think so,'' Smith said. ``That's something we will
deal with him during the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Tverdovsky was unavailable for comment. &QL; 
Ylonen signs &QL; 
The Coyotes have re-signed forward  &UR; Juha Ylonen, who would have
been a restricted free-agent at season's end, to a three-year
contract. Terms were not available.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's OK and I'm very happy,'' Ylonen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (Coyotes) came to me about it a month ago and we got in
done about two weeks ago, just before I broke my foot. I'm going to
be in the Valley for a couple weeks after the season, then I'm
going home to Finland for the summer and start working for next
year.'' &QL; 
Adams plays &QL; 
While center  &UR; Jeremy Roenick staged a surprise comeback, so did
second-line left wing  &UR; Greg Adams, whose services have been limited
to two games because of a strained groin.
</P>
<P>
   Adams'return was a game-time decision, but he addressed the
dilemma he was facing Tuesday after the morning skate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not 100 percent or anywhere near,'' Adams said. ``I want
to go, but at the same time I don't want to take a spot if someone
who's 100 percent can give the team more. That's the decision;
whether I can contribute at 80-85 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get in you get caught up in the game.'' &QL; 
Travel dilemma &QL; 
St. Louis management was perplexed entering Game 7. Initially, it
planned to check out of the Ritz-Carlton before the game and either
return home in the event of a loss, or to re-check into the hotel
for the night before leaving for Dallas today to meet the Stars in
the second-round on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   After thinking about it, management thought the Blues might take
it as a poor vote of confidence and decided the team would either
fly to St. Louis or to Dallas after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The right message to send your team, if it's a Game 7 and
you're on the road, is to give them six- or seven-days meal
money,'' Coyotes Coach  &UR; Jim Schoenfeld said, laughing. ``If you
give them one day's meal money and wait and see, you're not showing
a lot of faith in your troops.'' &QL; 
Understanding guy &QL; 
Rookie  &UR; Daniel Briere spent three-fourths of the season with the
Coyotes, only to be sent to the AHL Springfield Falcons as the
playoffs approached. He was recalled last week, but has seen no
action and was a spectator Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could be in the lineup, but . . . at the end I wasn't
playing much or playing well,'' he said. ``They went with other
guys. I understand. For me it's a good learning experience to be
here and learn around a Game 7 and gain experience for the
future.'' &QL;

NUNEZ'S PERFORMANCE FORCING PERSONNEL DECISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Reliever  &UR; Vladimir Nunez was called up as insurance
on April 14, one day after the Diamondbacks exhausted their
relievers in a 16-inning marathon victory over Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks later, the club has been pleasantly surprised with
Nunez's effort. The right-hander has an 0.96 ERA in 9 innings and
may actually find himself squeezing fellow reliever  &UR; Amaury
Telemaco off the club's roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm working hard trying to stay here,'' Nunez said. ``I know
the other teams study you once you reach this level. My thinking is
I have to learn something new everyday now that I'm here. I have a
better idea of how tough it is to stay at this level.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks must decide by Saturday what to do with
Telemaco. The options are to bring him to the big-league roster,
trade him or place him on waivers.
</P>
<P>
   Telemaco's 30-day injury rehabilitation assignment ends Friday
night. Because Telemaco is out of options, the club must make one
of the above-mentioned moves.
</P>
<P>
   Because Nunez and  &UR; Brian Anderson are the only two candidates
with options remaining, one or the other could wind up being sent
down if Arizona opts to keep Telemaco. The chances of that being
Anderson seem remote given his nearly four years of big-league
service time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, Vladimir's got a pretty good thing going,'' Manager
 &UR; Buck Showalter said. ``I think he realizes the fleetingness of
being here, how you have to prove yourself. We're real proud of
him.''
</P>
<P>
   From none to second &QL; 
 &UR; Tony Womack, who has been converted to an outfielder, made his
first start at second base. Womack was inserted at second base, his
position the past two seasons with Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Showalter wanted to give his normal double-play combination a
day off. Womack started at second and  &UR; Andy Fox got the start at
shortstop in place of  &UR; Tony Batista. &QL; 
Womack played four innings at second base in the 16-inning game on
April 13. &QL; 
New experience &QL; 
 &UR; Randy Johnson, who is scheduled to start tonight's game, has never
started a game in Cincinnati. Johnson's only experience in
Cincinnati was on April 25, 1989, in a relief role with the
Montreal Expos, one of nine career relief appearances in 302 career
games. &QL;

AN ERA ENDS IN INGLEWOOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Byron Scott was no different than most kids
growing up in the shadow of the Fabulous Forum in the 1970s. He was
enchanted by his neighbors at Manchester and Prairie.
</P>
<P>
   On game nights, he staked out the arena's service entrance on
90th Street, waiting for glimpses of the great Jerry West. He'd
wave pens and slips of paper at the opposing team's bus, hoping to
coax an autograph from personal idol Bob McAdoo of the Buffalo
Braves. And, occasionally, he'd sneak into the building through
side doors known only to arena personnel and neighborhood kids
devoted to the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, Scott would realize a dream and don the
purple-and-gold himself _ a direct result of the passion instilled
in him during those many nights hanging out at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something that changed my life and showed me what I
wanted to do. I never wanted anything more after going to a couple
games but to be an NBA basketball player,'' says Scott, who
graduated from Morningside High and later won three championship
rings as a member of the ``Showtime''-era Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing how good they were, how the fans loved them and the
clothes they wore, how stylish they looked... it just made me want
it that much more.''
</P>
<P>
   That lifelong bond with the Lakers makes it that much more
painful for Scott to see his former team bid farewell to the Forum
and to his humble hometown of Inglewood, the self-described ``City
of Champions.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonight the Lakers play their final regular-season home game at
the Forum, with an undetermined number of playoff games to follow.
Then they will join the NHL's Kings, who have already played their
final game, in moving to the luxurious new Staples Center in
downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. gains the teams that have borne the city's name for more
than three decades. But Inglewood _ an incorporated city of 118,000
whose name never appeared on jerseys, only in newspaper datelines _
loses its two most renowned residents. And with the Lakers and
Kings go hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue, an
incalculable measure of civic pride and many, many memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first reaction was a lot of sadness, because I grew up with
this team, and to me it was like the `Inglewood Lakers,''' says
Scott, now an assistant coach for the Sacramento Kings. ``It was
the only major sport we could call our own when I grew up in
Inglewood. It was right down the street, and I could walk to the
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gonna be a big blow to the city, because they have pretty
much adopted the team as their own _ `City of Champions.'... When
they play that last game, it's going to be a big disappointment to
the city of Inglewood and it's going to be a sad day for not only
kids but adults also.'' &QL; 
Inglewood loses out
</P>
<P>
   And, it will be a sad day for those who have made a living off
the Lakers' and Kings' residence. The manager of the Sizzler on
Manchester Boulevard anticipates possible layoffs. The Lakers
T-shirt vendor down Prairie, on the ``Avenue of Champions,'' won't
have the same captive audience.
</P>
<P>
   The city's general fund of $59 million could take a hit of about
$1 million, according to the city's finance department, though the
losses could be offset by new events booked at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   After a 32-year relationship between the city and the teams,
it's no wonder that among Inglewood business people and political
activists there are bitter feelings of abandonment. The issue is so
volatile that city staff members tap dance around it, and Lakers
and Kings officials would rather not discuss it.
</P>
<P>
   In a reflection of the politically charged divorce from
Inglewood, the Lakers are not commemorating tonight's final
regular-season game at the Forum. In fact, the public relations
staff has been instructed not to mention the significance of the
evening in any game-night events.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Lakers will stage a fan appreciation night in
October, when the Lakers play a relatively meaningless exhibition
game at the Forum before next season.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the city is bracing for potentially severe financial
losses. For every sold-out Lakers game, city hall takes in about
$13,000 from sources such as admissions and parking taxes, plus
increased sales tax revenue from the thousands of fans who descend
on the city.
</P>
<P>
   The city is already anticipating a tight budget year, and such a
hit could potentially throw the city general fund into a deficit in
fiscal year 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's significant to us,'' finance director Nick Rives said of
the sports-related revenue.
</P>
<P>
   What effect the loss will have is undetermined, but a worst-case
scenario could mean budget cutbacks, even layoffs, though city
officials avoid such dire predictions.
</P>
<P>
   At the least, the city might not need as many civilian and sworn
officers if there's no longer a need for additional security in the
Forum neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city is of course concerned,'' Inglewood city manager
Joseph Rouzan says. ``It's going to be hard for us to judge exactly
what impact (the loss of the Kings and Lakers) is going to have.'' &QL; 
Forum will live on
</P>
<P>
   Jeanie Buss is trying to diminish that impact. Buss, president
of the Forum and daughter of Lakers owner Jerry Buss, said the
arena will continue to be a thriving entertainment center for years
to come, even without its long-time tenants.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the Forum has hosted 185 to 200-plus events per
year. That number will drop to probably 120 to 150 events, and
``it's hard to say'' whether the arena will reach previous activity
levels again, Buss said.
</P>
<P>
   But she's optimistic. Buss recently secured a minor-league
hockey team from the West Coast Hockey League. Announcement of an
L.A. franchise should come in the next 60 days, and the team will
be playing here by fall 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the WNBA's Sparks are committed to the arena
through 2000, Forum boxing will continue, the number of concert
dates will increase to 30 or 40 per year and other dates will be
filled by family-oriented entertainment such as the circus.
</P>
<P>
   Gone will be Shaq and Kobe. In their place will be Barnum &AMP;
Bailey, 'N' Sync and Marilyn Manson.
</P>
<P>
   The Forum also will be part of L.A.'s bid for the 2012 Summer
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``This building has been left in a very good status,'' Jeanie
Buss said. ``It is debt-free and so we feel very positive it will
be successful in its own right, even without NBA and NHL tenants. I
see a very, very, very promising future for the Forum.'' &QL; 
Downtown too attractive
</P>
<P>
   For many in Inglewood, nothing can replace the Lakers and Kings,
who have played a combined 2,800 games here since the Forum opened
in December 1967. And there are many civic leaders who are angry
with both city hall, for failing to fight harder to keep the teams,
and with Kings owners Philip Anschutz and Ed Roski, for choosing
downtown L.A. instead of Inglewood for the new arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``They definitely owe the city something,'' said Charles Harkey,
business activist and owner of Inglewood Tickets. ``I think there
should have been some kind of compensation for the Lakers (and
Kings) leaving.... You're here, you made the money, you have taken
resources out of the community and certainly when you're given a
magnificent deal downtown where you're leaving because you're
making money, that shouldn't be a hard thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Kings say moving downtown was less a financial decision
_ they estimate it would have been $50 million to $100 million
cheaper to build in Inglewood _ than a philosophical one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, it was a difficult choice, because we were
comfortable with Inglewood,'' said Kings president Tim Leiweke.
``But when you looked at the impact the arena would create for Los
Angeles by being in downtown Los Angeles, it was too big an
opportunity, too big a challenge and too big a potential to pass
up.... We saw a great opportunity to spark the rejuvenation of
downtown Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Staples Center has helped L.A. attract next year's
Democratic Convention, secure the Grammy Awards and the 2002 U.S.
Figure Skating Championships, Leiweke said.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers owner Jerry Buss lobbied the Kings to build in Inglewood,
but once the site was chosen, Buss made a simple business decision
to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Buss, who also owns the Forum, said his team needed a
state-of-the-art arena, and the lure of the Kings-financed, $365
million Staples Center was too great to turn down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like Inglewood,'' Buss said. ``If I had made the
decision myself, the answer is yes, I would have stayed in
Inglewood _ in a state of the art facility.''
</P>
<P>
   As for compensating Inglewood, as some have suggested, the
Kings' ownership is considering building a soccer stadium there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life will go on. We were not their sole existence or center of
their day-to-day lives,'' Leiweke said. ``I think Inglewood will
find other business opportunities that they will rally behind.'' &QL; 
The next chapter
</P>
<P>
   The ``City of Champions'' is already refocusing its image.
</P>
<P>
   The street-pole banners bearing the likenesses of Shaquille
O'Neal and Kobe Bryant are slowly being phased out; in their place
are images of thoroughbreds and a jazz trumpeter (Hollywood Park
and casino), doctors attending to a patient (Centinela Hospital),
and graphic representations of highway interchanges and L.A.
International Airport _ symbols of the city's growth and its
connection to the regional economy.
</P>
<P>
   But what's the ``City of Champions'' without its (begin
ital)champions?(end ital) Actually, the motto predates the Kings
and Lakers _ the phrase coined after the city hosted the marathon
for the 1932 Olympics, and three Inglewood natives won Olympic
events.
</P>
<P>
   And the motto will live on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course we still have champions,'' insists former assistant
city manager Norm Cravens. ``We have championship race horses and
we have championship jockeys and we have championship medical
people. Hockey players and NBA players aren't the only kind of
champions.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Rouzan said with a wistful laugh, ``I guess we need
another marathon or something.''

EDITORIAL: PATAKI'S PALLID DRUG REFORMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, May 5:
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki's proposed changes to New York state's rigid
drug laws are utterly inadequate. Instead of overhauling the drug
statutes that have filled state prisons with nonviolent drug
offenders at a cost of hundreds of millions a year, he has proposed
some tinkering that would allow very modest relief to a small
number of felons who have received sentences that are out of
proportion to their crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki seems to believe that this minor change will persuade
Democrats who want drug-law reform to support his plan to eliminate
parole for all felons. Last year the state ended parole for all
violent felons, replacing parole board discretion on the time of a
prisoner's release with a sentencing structure in which convicts
are given a fixed prison term. Now Pataki is pushing to end parole
for people convicted of nonviolent felonies. The administration
says the intent is not to lengthen sentences but to inject more
certainty into sentencing. The parole issue deserves legislative
debate. But it should not stand in the way of reforming the
drug-sentencing laws now.
</P>
<P>
   Under the drug laws, which date to the Rockefeller era,
first-time offenders convicted of selling more than two ounces or
possessing more than four ounces of cocaine, heroin or other
controlled substances must be sentenced to a minimum of 15 years.
Another Rockefeller-era law greatly increases time for second-time
offenders. Currently, more than 22,000 people _ roughly a third of
the total prison population _ are incarcerated for drug offenses.
Most are low-level users who could be rehabilitated more cheaply
through treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's drug-law proposal, however, would not do away
with this wasteful system. He would only allow appellate judges to
reduce the minimum 15-year sentence to 10 years in isolated cases
involving first-time offenders convicted of possessing more than
four ounces of a narcotic.
</P>
<P>
   That would apply to very few people, perhaps 250 offenders, and
would not restore proportionality to most drug sentences. His plan
would also allow some low-level drug-addicted offenders, with a
prosecutor's consent, to avoid prosecution if they successfully
complete a treatment program. That is a positive step. But it fails
to revamp the drug laws in a comprehensive way.

APACHE HELICOPTER IN ALBANIA CRASHES ON TRAINING MISSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An Army Apache helicopter on a training mission
crashed about 45 miles northeast of the Tirana-Rinas airport in
Albania on Tuesday night, the Pentagon reported. There was no
immediate word on the fate of the crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no initial indications of hostile fire,'' said a
Pentagon spokesman, Jim Kout, adding that a rescue helicopter was
sent to the crash scene. The Apache was part of the helicopter
force supporting the overall NATO mission in Yugoslavia. Kout said
the helicopter crashed at about 1:30 a.m. local time, or 7:30 p.m.
Eastern daylight time.
</P>
<P>
   The accident was the second involving the Apache, the Army's
vaunted antitank weapon, during the Balkans deployment. On April
26, an Apache crashed within a few miles of the site of of Tuesday
evening's crash. Both pilots survived that crash.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of two Apaches could add to the unease some military
authorities have expressed about sending the helicopter, which
normally operates at low altitudes, into Kosovo over rugged terrain
that may be occupied by hostile troops armed with surface-to-air
missiles.

DODGERS DULL IN DEFEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ The Dodgers' flight home takes more than five hours.
They leave after tonight's game at Montreal and arrive home early
Thursday morning to conclude one of their most difficult road trips
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers left home playing horribly and below .500 and will
return in second place, and anything other than a win will bring a
disappointing finish to the nine-game trip.
</P>
<P>
   After being shut down by Montreal's Carl Pavano in a 2-1 loss
Tuesday at Olympic Stadium, tonight's conclusion of the three-game
series is the difference between a good road trip and a stellar
road trip, especially given the competition.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos (8-17) won for the fourth time in 18 home games.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the East Coast swing, with the start in the Midwest and
this type of road trip travel-wise, it'll be great to win,'' said
catcher Todd Hundley, who accounted for the Dodgers' lone run with
a seventh-inning homer. ``It's definitely one that will make the
plane ride much better. The (begin ital)long(end ital) plane
ride.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers (15-12) aren't beating up on the National League
powerhouses _ Milwaukee, Philadelphia and Montreal are a combined
33-44 _ but given the way they played on their last homestand, a
sweep in Milwaukee and winning two of three in Philadelphia was
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   And after winning the opener in Montreal handily to go 6-1 on
the trip, the Dodgers were in position for their first eight-win
road trip since August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   That's no longer possible, but when the Dodgers lost four of six
on their last homestand to fall to 9-10 they hardly looked like a
contender in the NL West. They were 3{ games behind San Francisco.
And it's possible they could be just a half-game behind the Giants
when they touch down at LAX.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a good road trip,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson
said. ``Win two of three here is what we need to do. We need to win
the series. We need to put it together and make the trip back
easier.''
</P>
<P>
   To do that, the Dodgers must put forth a better offensive effort
than the one against the right-hander Pavano, whose best outing to
date was a three-run, five-inning stint against the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Pavano's talent finally manifested itself or fatigue
wore on the Dodgers _ Johnson gave both thoughts credence _ didn't
really matter. The Dodgers tied a season low with four hits and
didn't have two runners on base in any inning.
</P>
<P>
   Pavano (1-4) entered with four losses and a 7.83 ERA and left
with his first win and his ERA down to 6.23. He struck out six,
didn't walk a batter and tied his career-high by pitching 71/3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got everyone out of balance,'' Dodgers second baseman Jose
Vizcaino said. ``He was changing his pitches, using his fastball.
He had a good changeup. He was sharp. He was throwing the ball
right where the catcher wanted it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pavano was slightly better than Dodgers starter Ismael Valdes
(3-1), who lost for the first time. The Expos had a base runner in
every inning but the ninth, but could only muster a pair of runs in
the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Guerrero gave the Expos (8-17) a 1-0 lead with his
fifth homer of the season. Later in the inning, Orlando Cabrera
doubled home Chris Widger to put Montreal ahead 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he took Valdes out after the sixth inning because
the recurring blister he's had surfaced again. Valdes yielded seven
hits, waked three and struck out five.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen him a little sharper, he made a few mistakes out
there,'' Johnson said. ``Pavano was just outstanding. A lot of
first-pitch strikes, made some good pitches with his curveball. It
didn't look like he was struggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you just give up a couple of runs, you're supposed to
win.''

STORMS MISS TRIPLE-A GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Southwestern Bell Bricktown Ballpark, home of
the Rangers' Triple-A affiliate in the Pacific Coast League,
suffered no damage after Monday's fierce tornadoes cut a path of
destruction through Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   Officials suspended Monday's game between the Oklahoma RedHawks
and Memphis Redbirds after the third inning and postponed last
night's game. The RedHawks' ballpark, though, provided a haven for
its spectators while tornadoes hit the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people stayed there because it was a safe place,''
said John Blake, the Rangers' vice president for public relations.
</P>
<P>
   Last night's postponement, though, means that Rangers
right-hander John Burkett (bursitis, right shoulder) did not make
the second start of his medical rehabilitation assignment.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers instead plan for Burkett to fly to Jackson, Miss.,
and pitch tonight for Double-A Tulsa. Burkett will rejoin the
Rangers if all goes well and start Sunday against the Blue Jays in
Toronto, manager Johnny Oates said. FREQUENT STROLLERS Left fielder
Rusty Greer and designated hitter Rafael Palmeiro are the Rangers'
only qualifying players (81 or more plate appearances) with more
walks than strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Greer enters tonight's game at Fenway Park with 15 walks and
only seven strikeouts, while Palmeiro has drawn 14 walks to 11
strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Only nine American League players with 350 or more at-bats
finished the 1998 season with more walks than strikeouts: Player
Team AB BB K Joey Cora Indians 602 73 59 Rickey Henderson Athletics
542 118 114 Chuck Knoblauch Yankees 603 76 70 Matt Lawton Twins 557
86 64 Kenny Lofton Indians 600 87 80 Edgar Martinez Mariners 556
106 96 Mark McLemore Rangers 461 89 64 Paul Molitor Twins 502 45 41
Frank Thomas White Sox 585 110 93 INJURY UPDATE Shortstop Royce
Clayton, whom the Rangers placed on the 15-day disabled list
Saturday, will remain in Texas during the road trip and continue to
rehabilitate the muscle strain behind his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Mike Simms yesterday received a cortisone injection
for bursitis in his right heel. Simms (torn left Achilles tendon)
is expected to resume his rehabilitation today. BRIEFLY Seven-time
Gold Glove Award recipient Ivan Rodriguez and former Rangers
catcher Jim Sundberg, who captured the award six times during his
career, are scheduled to appear May 14 at the Dr Pepper/Texas
Rangers Monthly Luncheon. The luncheon is scheduled for 11:30 a.m.
at The Ballpark in Arlington's Diamond Club. Tickets cost $20 and
can be purchased by calling (817) 273-5207.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' Home Run Derby at The Ballpark in Arlington returns
May 22 and June 26. Both qualifying rounds are scheduled from 9
a.m.-noon. Participants will receive 20 swings, and two will
advance to the July 19 final at The Ballpark. The entry fee costs
$125. Contestants must be at least 15 years old, and entries will
be limited to the first 100 paid contestants. Call Jack Lazorko at
(817) 273-5297 for more information.

VENAFRO FINDS UNEXPECTED SUCCESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Thursday's fifth-inning at-bat by Yankees
right fielder Paul O'Neill resulted in a double-play ground ball.
</P>
<P>
   His eighth-inning at-bat produced another routine ground ball.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill emerged from the third-base dugout puzzled after the
fourth of four 1-2-3 innings thrown by Rangers left-hander Mike
Venafro.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where did you get this guy from?'' O'Neill asked Rangers
third-base coach Jerry Narron while trotting to the outfield. ``The
upper deck?''
</P>
<P>
   Such praise from one of the American League's toughest outs _
not to mention a streak of 16 consecutive batters retired _
illustrates why Venafro's stint with the Rangers could be
unexpectedly prolonged.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers expect right-hander John Burkett to be reinstated
from the 15-day disabled list and to rejoin the rotation for a
start Sunday against the Blue Jays in Toronto. That will require a
roster move.
</P>
<P>
   Venafro, whom the Rangers recalled April 24 from Triple-A
Oklahoma for Burkett, once appeared destined to return to the minor
leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Venafro replaced the injured Burkett.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, a healthy Burkett replaces Venafro.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds logical, but the unexpected happened.
</P>
<P>
   Venafro has allowed one hit since that promotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I obviously want to be a part of this,'' said Venafro, whose
62/3 scoreless innings leave right-hander Danny Patterson in
jeopardy of losing his roster spot. ``I plan on doing everything I
can to stay here.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Johnny Oates declined to address his decision. ``No one
knows what's going to happen between now and then,'' he said,
hinting that Venafro could be around for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's making my decision easier,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Having three left-handed relievers in the bullpen is intriguing
to Oates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives me three moves, especially with the way Venafro is
throwing the ball,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   The manager used left-handers Dennis Cook, Mike Stanton and Ed
Vosberg effectively during the Rangers' 1996 AL West championship
season. Those three allowed Oates to orchestrate favorable
late-inning, situational matchups more frequently than any
major-league manager.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' 1996 relievers received a favorable matchup _
left-handed pitcher vs. left-handed batter or right-handed pitcher
vs. right-handed batter _ a major league-high 67.2 percent of the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Oates' 1996 relievers made 44 one-batter
appearances. That ranked fourth in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   The state of the Rangers' rotation creates the need for more
late-inning, situational matchups. The rotation will begin the game
against the Boston Red Sox tonight averaging 5.08 innings per
start.
</P>
<P>
   Having a third left-handed reliever would allow Oates to use a
lefty-righty-lefty combination of relievers to quell a threat
during an important inning ``and still have a left-hander sitting
out there'' in the bullpen, he said.
</P>
<P>
   That could leave others asking about Venafro, as O'Neill did
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully,'' Venafro said, ``he'll remember me now.''

RESTED AND READY

<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING _ With eight days to prepare for their second-round
playoff series that is scheduled to begin tomorrow night, what did
the Stars do yesterday?
</P>
<P>
   They took the day off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny. You talk about the downside of things and the
upside of things, well we've found a way to turn what we thought
was a downside into a big upside,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said.
``The breaks we had in October and November and February, we hated
them at the time. But now they're helping us. We've learned that
this is not a very good team when it practices three days in a row.
We've learned that we don't have to be on the ice all the time to
get things done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have eased through their eight-day break since ousting
Edmonton from the playoffs a week ago _ taking days off, scheduling
longer practices and following those with another day off.
</P>
<P>
   This is old hat. The Stars had two breaks of five games apiece
in October and November _ a lifetime by NHL standards _ and didn't
handle them well, Hitchcock said. Then, in February, they played
one game in 10 days and realized that too much practice wasn't good
for a veteran team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We \Roriginally\S felt we could use practices as game
preparation, like scrimmages, and mentally our team got burned
out,'' Hitchcock said. ``That little break \Rof one day\S seems to
give us a lot of energy. And I think your ability to win in the
playoffs has a lot to do with energy and freshness.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Stars begin the second round tomorrow, they will have
had time to rest, to heal and to plan for a multitude of different
attacks. And they will face an opponent that is likely to be
battered from a physical, seven-game series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to take advantage of that by being really good in the
first couple of games here,'' Hitchcock said. ``If we kind of wade
into this series and use \Rour\S not playing as a disadvantage,
they'll get out of this thing and they'll get better as they go on.
We have to jump hard and now and often and quick.''
</P>
<P>
   When the second round begins, Hitchcock will have several
decisions to make. He has seen a lineup that was missing six
players in Game 4 against the Edmonton Oilers get healthy to the
point where he's now missing only one injured player _ center Guy
Carbonneau.
</P>
<P>
   With Pat Verbeek expected to play his first game after being
sidelined three weeks with a knee injury, Hitchcock will have some
tough choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel Verbeek will be a good player for us,'' Hitchcock said.
``I just don't know where I'm going to play him.''
</P>
<P>
   Verbeek is a gritty right winger with goal-scoring skill (17)
and strength on the power play. He has played on the third and
fourth line for much of this season and would be a likely
replacement for rookie Blake Sloan. But Hitchcock said he doesn't
want to take Sloan out of the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   With Grant Marshall (groin) and Tony Hrkac (concussion) healthy,
Hitchcock will likely have to make a decision to sit at least two
of the following: Sloan, Verbeek, Hrkac, Brian Skrudland, Derek
Plante or Dave Reid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see us playing a group of 12\R(forwards\S, but to be honest
with you, I don't see four lines staying together,'' Hitchcock said
of the roll-four-lines policy he has used for much of the season.
``I see there's some big changes happening throughout the games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe \RBrett\S Hull, \SMike\S Modano and \RJere\S Lehtinen
might start out as a definitive threesome. But depending on the
checking roles for the other team were playing, maybe Verbeek might
have to be a player with Modano, or \RJamie\S Langenbrunner might
have to be a player with Modano.''
</P>
<P>
   Either way, players said the options are good.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what we've worked for,'' Carbonneau said. ``We want to
have these options. It's a lot better than not having them.''

THE DREAM OF OLYMPICS IS IRRESITIBLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ So tell me. What are you doing in the summer
of 2012?
</P>
<P>
   Can they count on you to retrieve a few javelins? Bail out some
over-zealous kayaks? Maybe drive a herd of Uzbekistanis to dinner?
</P>
<P>
   If so, follow that torch.
</P>
<P>
   Tomorrow night at Fair Park, the Dallas 2012 bid committee will
be looking for volunteers who want to buy into its Olympic dream.
</P>
<P>
   The dream lives, I feel obligated to report. Once just the
starry-eyed fantasy of Arlington trash entrepreneur Grady Hicks,
and once dubbed a ``silly idea'' by a columnist whose name (oops)
sounds remarkably similar to mine, the notion of bringing the 2012
Summer Olympics to North Texas continues to grow like wildflowers.
</P>
<P>
   We don't know whether to mow them down or take a picture with
them.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Luce, chairman of Dallas 2012, is banking on the latter.
Beginning at 6 p.m. in front of Fair Park's Hall of State, there
will be interactive demonstrations of Olympic sports, lasers,
fireworks, Olympians, a theme song and the inevitable lighting of
the torch.
</P>
<P>
   ``This started out as a news conference,'' said Dallas 2012
spokesman Kevin Sullivan. ``We wanted to launch our drive to
recruit volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the whole thing just kind of snowballed.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the snowball is being called the Dallas 2012 Opening
Ceremonies and Sports Festival. There will be a videotaped message
from Olympic champion runner Michael Johnson. Mayors Kenneth Barr
of Fort Worth, Elzie Odom of Arlington and Ron Kirk of Dallas will
render brief remarks. And a choir of 1,200 students, accompanied by
the University of North Texas orchestra, will debut ``Our Time to
Shine,'' a song written by Jim Kirk that will serve as the theme
for the 2012 bid.
</P>
<P>
   Resistance is futile.
</P>
<P>
   In the rain last Sunday, the committee held an orientation for
the 120 volunteers who will assist at tomorrow's event.
</P>
<P>
   Among the orienteers was swimmer Ryan Berube of SMU, who told
the saga of marching in with the U.S. team at the 1996 Atlanta
Olympics. He talked about the thrills and the chills and showed the
group the Olympic gold medal that he earned in the 4x200-meter
relay.
</P>
<P>
   As Berube spoke, some of the volunteers got misty eyed.
</P>
<P>
   Like I said, futile.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, the notion did seem preposterous. We don't
reside in anything I'd consider a cradle of Olympic sports. Our
boundaries are large and unwieldy. And we don't always get along
ourselves, whether it's arguing about an airport or a ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   But things happen on Planet Olympus. Citizens in Seattle,
considered by many to be the leading candidate for the U.S. bid,
voted to disband any effort to attract the Olympics. The
Baltimore-Washington bid still hasn't mustered any forward
momentum. A Los Angeles push has drawn been-there-done-that yawns.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, even the Olympic scandal in Salt Lake City has
helped the Dallas 2012 bid. The scrutiny in Salt Lake has
underlined the importance of a future bid city being a trusted host
to corporate headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Luce says he has had only one potential corporate contributor
mention the Utah scandal. By 2002, Luce said, ``the process will be
cleaned up, we will have clear rules, and there will be a level
playing field for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas 2012 committee has already formulated a policy of
publicly disclosing every expense and contribution. Board meetings
will be open to the public and the media. An independent ethics
advisory panel has been formed, to be chaired by former SMU law
school dean Paul Roger.
</P>
<P>
   Mighty hurdles, of course, still exist. Somebody _ Dallas?
Arlington? Jerry Jones? _ is going to have to build a new
$350-million stadium to house the track and field events and the
opening and closing ceremonies. Someone also needs to piece
together a $150-million Olympic Village.
</P>
<P>
   But Luce and his people have done their homework. Tomorrow
night's event could be Fair Park's debut as Dallas' Olympic park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a great asset to sell to the Olympic Committee,
and it's already assembled,'' Luce said. ``A lot of municipalities
would love to have a 275-acre park with controlled perimeters.''
</P>
<P>
   No artist sketches have been drawn, but the Dallas 2012 dream
includes constructing a pedestrian promenade from Fair Park to
downtown Dallas _ a Texas version of Barcelona's Las Ramblas, if
you will.
</P>
<P>
   The dream lives. The line for Olympic volunteers begins forming
in earnest tomorrow.
</P>

RESCUERS HAPPY TO FIND SURVIVORS IN VAST CHAOS

(EDS: Note further update in 7th graf on grandmother found) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DEANNA BOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGE CREEK, Okla. _ A 6-year-old boy walked aimlessly along a
road amid twisted mobile homes, crumpled cars and appliances
scattered randomly amid the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   When a massive tornado slammed into the Southern Hills
subdivision Monday evening, he and his mother were on the run,
heading to what they believed would be the safety of a nearby
creek, the boy told officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he saw the wind pick her up and take her off,'' said
Bob Paul, a deputy with the Grady County Sheriff's Department.
``When they found him, he was wandering the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking for his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday afternoon, law enforcement officers and the National
Guard continued searching for her in this farming community of
6,000 about 30 miles southwest of Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   While the National Guard scoured the south side of Bridge Creek,
the 30-member volunteer firefighter department led the search teams
in northern Bridge Creek.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reported that the mother was found alive
Tuesday afternoon under debris near her house, but last night a
Grady County sheriff's dispatcher said the boy's grandmother, not
mother, had been rescued.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say the Bridge Creek community was the hardest hit in
the series of deadly tornadoes that ravaged Oklahoma and Kansas.
Officials said 11 people were killed, most of them in Southern
Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Johnnie Lindsey was among the lucky ones.
</P>
<P>
   As the mile-wide tornado headed toward her mobile home, she had
four screaming children at her side. The pickup in her back
driveway wouldn't run. Lindsey, who was celebrating her 31st
birthday, grabbed bedding and sofa cushions and ushered her family
into the closet.
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes later, the walls were gone. Only a kitchen island
and a few pieces of furniture remained. Lindsey and her four
children, ages 11 months to 9 years, crouched in the rubble,
unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, we lived through it,'' an almost cheerful Lindsey said
Tuesday as she and her husband, James, picked through the debris
that had once been their home. ``What better birthday than that?
Happy birthday to me. Best present I ever got.''
</P>
<P>
   Grady County sheriff's officials tailing the huge tornado
arrived in Southern Hills to find bodies mingled with twisted
debris scattered across the hilly landscape. Among the dead were an
elderly woman and a 2-year-old child.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Palmore, a volunteer firefighter, said his first discovery
was a family huddled together, the grandmother dying and a
3-week-old baby missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found (the baby's) body about 300 feet away in the trees,''
Palmore said.
</P>
<P>
   Similar wrenching scenes would be repeated throughout the night,
he said, but the memories to which he clung were of finding people
alive.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to take ambulances into the rural area, rescuers used
pickups to load the injured, and later the dead. The Bridge Creek
school's gymnasium was transformed into a triage area; the school
cafeteria was a temporary morgue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people that were alive, they were just covered with mud.
You just had to look and then suddenly you'd see a pink tongue or
white eyes,'' Palmore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a lot of the Lord in my heart,'' he added. ``The Lord
was around here (Monday) night. I think he saved my family and a
bunch of others.''
</P>
<P>
   Grady County Sheriff's Deputy Al Hooper said he believed that
meteorologists' warnings saved many lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always have that certain amount of people that say, `Oh,
it's not going to get me. It's not going to hit,' '' Hooper said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it did.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
NEW YORK _ First, Mike Hampton frustrated the New York Mets with
his arm.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Next, he did it with his bat.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton allowed a meager two hits over seven innings Tuesday
night and ignited a five-run outburst over the final three innings
with a two-out triple as the Astros snapped the Mets' six-game
winning streak 6-1 at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton's triple was his second in 236 career at-bats. His first
came in 1997 against Cleveland's Orel Hershiser.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians played him to the right side, and Hampton hit the
ball to left-center field. On Tuesday, the Mets played Hampton
shallow. He drove it over their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just another case of me getting lucky,'' said Hampton,
who on the mound allowed only a sixth-inning run. ``I knew where
they were playing I had a chance to get it over their heads. (But)
that's where teams play every pitcher, except maybe Dwight Gooden
and Fernando Valenzuela. Those guys are probably just as good
position players as they are pitchers.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton had some help as four Astros had at least two of the
team's 13 hits.
</P>
<P>
   With the score tied at 1 in the top of the seventh, Hampton, who
hit a two-run double in his previous start April 29 against
Arizona, drilled a 1-0 pitch off Al Leiter (1-3) over the head of
Mets center fielder Brian McRae.
</P>
<P>
   That appeared to be the lift the Astros needed, as Craig Biggio
followed with an RBI double and Derek Bell hit a two-run homer to
left field to push the lead to 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Hampton) is like another hitter in our lineup,'' said Astros
shortstop Tim Bogar, who had an RBI double in a two-run eighth.
``He's not going to go out there and get punched out real easy.
That's the thing some teams forget; he is that kind of an athlete.
He's not an easy out like 90 percent of the rest of the pitchers in
the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Biggio's two-bagger was the 344th of his career, surpassing the
previous team doubles record held by Cesar Cedeo, an Astro from
1970-81.
</P>
<P>
   Bell's homer, a 387-foot foot shot, was his fifth of the season
and part of a 3-for-5 night. The Astros just missed hitting for the
cycle in four consecutive at-bats in the seventh when Jeff Bagwell
grounded out to third.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton (3-1) was a good enough athlete to receive scholarship
offers from Notre Dame and Florida State out of high school _ as a
defensive back.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what he gets paid for is to pitch,'' Astros manager Larry
Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   The normally potent Mets found out the hard way. In winning his
third straight decision, Hampton struck out five and walked three.
</P>
<P>
   After issuing a walk to the first batter he faced, Hampton
retired nine straight batters. And before Mike Piazza's RBI single
in the sixth, he had allowed only an infield hit _ charitably
scored at that, considering a poor throw from third baseman Ken
Caminiti _ to Edgardo Alfonzo in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Elarton allowed one hit in two scoreless innings of relief
as the Astros won for the eighth time in 11 games and improved to
4-1 on their six-game road trip. Dating to last Aug. 10, they are
12-4 in Hampton's last 16 starts.
</P>
<P>
   The top five spots in the New York batting order came into the
game hitting a career .361 (26-for-72) against Hampton with 10
RBIs. They went a combined 3-for-14 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Mets) are a pretty hot team. They throw some pretty good
bats at you, and you have to concentrate on every pitch,'' Hampton
said. ``The big thing is I didn't make too many mistakes over the
middle of the plate. I was able to keep the ball down, work in and
out, and change speeds. With a team like this, you have to minimize
your mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros got on the scoreboard first in the fourth when
Bagwell and Caminiti hit consecutive singles and Richard Hidalgo
followed with an RBI double into the left-field corner. They did,
however, leave the bases loaded for the third time in the past four
games.
</P>
<P>
   But Leiter would finally cave, allowing six runs and a
season-high 11 hits in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I want to pitch a shutout every time out there,''
Leiter said. ``I felt pretty good tonight until the seventh
inning.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Eusebio, who is 6-for-13 in his last three games, knocked
Leiter out with an RBI single in the eighth, and Bogar followed two
batters later with a run-scoring double off reliever Josias
Manzanillo to cap the scoring.

MYSTICS SELECT HOLDSCLAW AS NO. 1 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Chamique Holdsclaw stood on the podium holding her
new jersey in front of her. The most notable thing about
Holdsclaw's appearance _ aside from the professional hairstyling
and makeup obviously preparing her for an endorsement bonanza _ was
that it was not a New York Liberty uniform the best player in the
game held, despite conspiracy theories that had dominated
discussion about the Women's National Basketball Association
draft. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Holdsclaw, the four-time all-American from Tennessee, was taken
by the Washington Mystics as the first pick of the WNBA draft on
Tuesday, and she is staying put. No trade, no manipulation by the
league, nothing is bringing Holdsclaw back to New York, where she
grew up and starred at Christ the King High School. ``A lot of
people wanted me to play in New York,'' Holdsclaw said. ``I'm kind
of glad I didn't. I don't know if I could have handled the pressure
and the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of playing in New York with Tennessee, she added: ``I
learned a lesson when I played in Madison Square Garden. Your
friends want tickets, they want to be with you, and I don't need
that right now. I'm trying to establish my own life. It's just like
Marbury. He wanted to be in New York, but he settled for New
Jersey. If I came here, I would get no rest.''
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty's general manager, Carol Blazejowski, said the team
tried to negotiate with Washington before the draft to establish
the possibility of a trade. But the Mystics rebuffed everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Holdsclaw, a 6-foot-2-inch guard-forward who took Tennessee to
three straight national championships and averaged 21.3 points a
game last season, was undoubtedly the star of an extraordinarily
deep draft, stocked full of experienced players from the defunct
American Basketball League. Because of the wealth of talent, just
12 collegians were among the 50 picks in the four-round draft.
Holdsclaw was the only one in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   The new collective bargaining agreement allowed each of the 10
existing teams to take three ABL players and the two expansion
teams to take five apiece. Thirty-five AB. players were picked,
including Jennifer Azzi (Detroit, 5th pick over all), Yolanda
Griffith (Sacramento, 2d pick), Kate Starbird (Sacramento, 26th)
and Jennifer Rizzotti (Houston, 48th). The only ABL player who did
not sign a contract with the WNBA, and so was not eligible for the
draft, was Teresa Edwards. It was not known why she hadn't signed.
</P>
<P>
   When it became obvious to the Liberty that nothing was going to
swing Holdsclaw its way _ and that the league would not step in to
help a deal putting the top player in the league's biggest media
market, something that the league's president, Valerie B. Ackerman,
said was never even considered _ New York tried to fill its
multiple needs, particularly for perimeter scoring and youth.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty, which was 18-12 and missed the playoffs last year,
averaged just 68.6 points a game, eighth of the 10 teams in the
league. Center Kym Hampton is 36, point guard Teresa Weatherspoon
is 33, and the shooting guard Sophia Witherspoon is 29. For that
reason, Coach Richie Adubato anticipates a highly charged training
camp, with almost every starting position up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   In taking Crystal Robinson, 25, with the sixth pick of the first
round, the Liberty gets a 5-11 forward who, with the Colorado
Xplosion of the ABL, averaged 14.9 points a game and who shot 52
percent from the floor and 46.6 percent from 3-point range. She can
play shooting guard and small forward. ``Her perimeter shooting is
as good as anyone we've seen,'' Adubato said. ``Her overall
shooting is excellent, not only from 3-point, but also midrange.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said: ``I have a gift for scoring. New York has a great
core group, but they need something they can go to in the clutch,
someone who can score every night.''

ARIZONA COALITION TARGETS FRAUD AIMED AT SENIORS
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MAUREEN WEST  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   An Arizona coalition announced Tuesday the largest joint
educational campaign against telemarketing in the state's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough of making it open season on seniors in Arizona,'' said
Attorney General Janet Napolitano during the public launch of Opera
tion Intercept, a two-month elder fraud prevention campaign.
</P>
<P>
   While no money was targeted toward it, organizers say they their
agencies will donate their time. And they will be calling heavily
on volunteers to help make it a success.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the campaign is to educate Arizona elders and their
children about telemarketing fraud so fewer of the state's
grandparents will fall prey to financial scams.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign was created by the Elder Fraud Prevention Team
whose members also include other law officials, the U.S. Postal
Inspection Service, AARP and the Arizona Cardinals football team.
Members of the Cardinals will be donating their time for television
or radio spots.
</P>
<P>
   According to the FBI, Arizona victims have lost more than $100
million since 1994. Nationwide, over $40 billion a year is lost to
telemarketing fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arizona continues to be a high target area for illegal
telemarketers due to the state's significant number of elderly
residents,'' said FBI supervisory Special Agent Jim Whalen.
</P>
<P>
   The average person loses $20,000 to $100,000, said Whalen,
though in one recent case a Valley man lost $1.8 million. He was
called by a Canadian company and told he had won the lottery but he
had to send $4,200 in fees, which he did continually. Though he had
been a successful businessman, he was suffering from dementia and
didn't realize he was doing it time and again, Whalen said.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, a family didn't find out until their father
died that he had squandered $2 million of his $8 million in assets
on fraudulent investment scams.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Telemarketing Task Force formed five years ago but
most of its efforts have been directed at prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are putting people in jail, but many of their victims still
lose their nest egg and their dignity,'' said Daniel Drake,
executive assist ant U.S. Attorney. The last three cases his agency
prosecuted in volved scams of $17 million. Only 5 percent was
recovered for victims.
</P>
<P>
   Since February of 1994 there have been 152 arrests for telemar
keting scams in Arizona with 154 indictments and 112 convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Napolitano agreed that such pros ecutions aren't the only
solution. ``Prevention and education is what this program is all
about,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone was delighted with the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like a good step but it doesn't go far enough, said
Joe Soltis of Scottsdale, whose father has fallen victim to some
question able solicitations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am disappointed the Legisla ture doesn't have the courage to
enact laws that would clamp down on scams of the elderly, and on
products that offer no value to them,'' he said. ``Some are coerced
into buying products they don't need.''
</P>
<P>
   AARP volunteer Ann Weber, however, sees Operation Intercept as a
great beginning. ``We have to keep trying. Friends, neighbors have
to be on a lookout. Person-to-person is how change is going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Morton, also an AARP volunteer, agreed. Tuesday morning
she had received three unsolicited calls from people wanting her to
purchase something over the phone. One man said he was going to be
in her area that week and would stop by with a product. When she
quizzed him further and asked him to name the area she lived in, he
was stumped.
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, the Elder Fraud Prevention Team, which
formed last fall, will hold commu nity fraud forums in Phoenix on
May 13, in Sierra Vista on May 27 and in Kingman on June 23.
Earlier this year there were similar forums were held in Mesa,
Phoenix, Pres cott and Yuma.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Cardinals football play ers, including wide receiver
Frank Sanders, will tape public service announcements asking
younger rela tives and neighbors of elders to be on the lookout for
scams. Sanders is doing this partly because his own grandmother
helped raise him. ``I don't want anyone taking advantage of me, my
grandmother or any elders in the state of Arizona,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A series of live call-in shows will air on KAET (Channel 8) at 7
p.m. June 28, June 29 and July 1.
</P>
<P>
   While the fraud prevention efforts will continue throughout the
year, Operation Intercept will conclude with a reverse boiler room
in Phoenix on July 13. The phone bank of volunteers will make warn
ing calls to Arizona elders whose names were found on lists used by
convicted scam artists.
</P>
<P>
   Fraudulent telemarketers are de veloping new scams and frauds
constantly, often based on the day's news. Appealing to the elder
gener ation's spirit of community, fake charities are likely to
spring up in the wake of any national tragedy, including the
Midwest tornadoes or Colorado shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Or appealing to the desire or need for money, fraud merchants
offer phony prizes, illegal sweepstakes or sham investments.

   Whalen of the FBI says that the two biggest schemes now in Ari
zona involve lottery and investment frauds.
</P>
<P>
   Recent investigations by the FBI indicate that 80 percent of
calls were deliberately targeted at older people.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to popular belief, re search sponsored by AARP shows
that the older people victimized by fraudulent telemarketers are
not lonely, vulnerable or isolated. The typical telemarketing fraud
victims are relatively affluent, well-educated people, socially
active in their community and just as suspicious of dishonest
telemarketers as non-vic tims.
</P>
<P>
   Not all sweepstakes and contests are scams. Or telemarketers
crooks. But the FBI estimates that there are more than 1,400 scam
operations making calls each day in America. Most of them, it
seems, at dinner time.

CAMPUS HATE CRIMES ON RISE THROUGHOUT L.A. COUNTY
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hate crimes in schools in Los Angeles County
increased last year despite an overall drop in such offenses, the
county Human Relations Commission reported.
</P>
<P>
   With concern heightened by the recent Colorado school massacre,
authorities warned that hate crimes often go unreported and that
much more needs to be done to make students more aware and
respectful of each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sharp increase in race hate crimes in our schools at a
time when hate crimes generally are decreasing is an indicator of
the need for everyone to focus on our youth and their attitudes
toward students of other races and ethnicities,'' said Ron
Wakabayashi, the commission's chairman. ``I wish that we had one
bullet that could take care of all of these things, but it's far
more difficult than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking the county's hate crime temperature, the commission's
annual report, released Tuesday, showed 769 hate crimes reported in
1998 compared with 820 in 1997, a 6.2 percent decline.
</P>
<P>
   Hate crimes at schools, however, increased from 40 to 46 _ a 15
percent increase _ over the same period. The number of crimes
motivated by race increased more alarmingly, from 19 to 29, a 53
percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   In all categories, the three leading hate crime offenses were
assault and battery, criminal threats and vandalism, and the
victims primarily were African-Americans, gay men and Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Gil Garcetti said juveniles are responsible
for more than 50 percent of all county hate crimes, and that his
office is responding with an intervention program in the Antelope
Valley schools that will receive $150,000 in federal funding and
could be expanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us an opportunity not just to prosecute kids, but to
turn kids around,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Garcetti noted that the two teens who shot to death 12 students
and a teacher at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., are a
glaring example that hate crimes can happen in schools anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But he contended that hate crimes on campus have to be reported
for law enforcement to help battle the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to see those rates continue to come down. But our fear
is there are a tremendous number of hate crimes that go on at
schools that are unreported,'' Garcetti said.
</P>
<P>
   California schools are not required to report hate crimes on
annual crime forms the state has mandated the past three years,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The L.A. school district and some other districts have adopted
formal policies for reporting crimes to law enforcement agencies
and dealing with less serious incidents within the campus
community.
</P>
<P>
   Even the 4-year-old L.A. district policy, however, has been slow
to take hold, district officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``While this policy is being enforced, there's a need for
greater awareness of the policy and the need for reporting,'' said
Dan Isaacs, assistant superintendent for school operations.
``There's a need to enhance sensitivity to address hate
incidents.''
</P>
<P>
   Isaacs said the district's Office of Intergroup Relations has
been training every principal and at least a lead teacher at every
campus in the hate crime policy. ``And I think as this filters
through the system, we will see a greater number of hate crimes
reported.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the district's policy, examples of hate-motivated
incidents that would be handled on campus include acts or
expressions of hostility because of the victim's real or perceived
race, religion, disability, gender, nationality or sexual
orientation. Acts include insults, taunts or slurs, and
distributing or posting hate group literature or posters.
</P>
<P>
   Hate-motivated crimes that must be reported to police are
defined in the state penal code and include threatening phone
calls, hate mail, physical assault, vandalism, cross burnings and
other destruction of religious symbols.
</P>
<P>
   The district's Office of Intergroup Relations was established
five years ago to help prevent hate crimes, and one approach has
been developing classroom programs to deal with potential bias,
hatred or prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   The newest efforts include requiring ninth-graders to complete a
semester-long course beginning in the 2000-2001 school year
focusing on intergroup relations, tolerance, respect and community
service. A similar class also is planned for sixth-graders the
following school year, Isaacs said.
</P>
<P>
   The program between the district attorney and the Antelope
Valley schools is called JOLT _ Juvenile Offenders Learning
Tolerance. It is designed to teach and promote diversity and keep
students in school short of expulsion, said Carla Aranaga, who
heads the District Attorney's Office's Hate Crimes Unit.
</P>
<P>
   The need for a program was determined based on reports from the
FBI civil rights office in Lancaster, juvenile crime cases and
incidents reported on campuses, Aranaga said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know our youth, our children, are not born to hate. It
comes from someplace. We have a duty to give them options and
choices through education,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Countywide, racial hate crimes were by far the leading category.
One victim was a Torrance electrical engineer who described a July
incident at the commission's news conference Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hernando Arauco, a Latino, said a white man chased him down in
his car after Arauco honked his car's horn at the man. The man
rammed the back of Arauco's car, ran at Arauco outside the car
yelling racial insults and attacked him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physically, I was battered and had to undergo medical
rehabilitation, including surgery, to regain the normal movement of
my arms and legs,'' he said. ``Psychologically, I find myself
scarred for life, chasing ghosts in my own home, not knowing if
this stranger would come looking for me and my family after his
arrest and release.''
</P>
<P>
   The man pleaded no contest to battery and received a 90-day
suspended jail sentence, officials said.

MLICKI STOPS ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Dave Mlicki wasn't good enough to crack the Dodgers'
starting rotation, but Angels hitters might find that difficult to
believe.
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki, traded to the Detroit Tigers by the Dodgers on April 16,
held the Angels to one run in seven innings in the Tigers' 3-1
victory Tuesday night before 13,411 at Tiger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki, however, did not get the win because the Tigers did not
take the lead until the eighth inning on Dean Palmer's two-run
homer off Mark Petkovsek. It spoiled another impressive performance
by Angels starter Ken Hill, who allowed just one run and seven hits
in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Brocail (1-0) earned the victory over Mike Holtz (1-1).
Todd Jones pitched the ninth and got his fourth save.
</P>
<P>
   It was Mlicki's fourth start with the Tigers since the trade,
and in three of them, he has allowed one earned run or fewer. He
also lowered his ERA to 2.01 after yielding five hits, including a
solo homer by Matt Walbeck that accounted for all of the Angels
offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was behind a lot of good pitchers in L.A.,'' Mlicki said.
``And I was in the bullpen. I didn't like that too much. It was
hard knowing that I can start, but I had to look at it like we had
some good arms over there and I couldn't take it personally. Who
are you going to take out of the rotation?''
</P>
<P>
   It was Mlicki whom the Dodgers removed from the rotation, and
Tuesday he made the Angels pay. The Angels, however, made a
relative unknown like John Snyder of the White Sox look good Monday
when Snyder threw a complete-game four-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Without Tim Salmon in the lineup (sprained left wrist), the
Angels looked feeble at the plate Tuesday. When batting with
runners in scoring position, they were 0 for 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to start finding holes in big situations,'' Angels
manager Terry Collins said. ``You win games with two-out hits with
guys in scoring position. We're just not swinging very good right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   With Salmon out of the lineup, Troy Glaus batted cleanup. In the
first inning, he came to the plate with runners on second and third
and one out. He struck out and the Angels didn't score in the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take responsibility for that,'' Collins said. ``I slapped
him in the 4-spot. That's a lot of responsibility for a young guy.
I'm sure his grip on the bat was tighter than normal.''
</P>
<P>
   For Hill, it was another hard-luck outing. Tuesday's game marked
the fourth in a row that he's gone at least seven innings. He
hasn't allowed more than three runs in any of them, but has only
one win to show for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying, man,'' Hill said. ``I'm just trying to get some
consistency. The thing is timely hitting. They got timely hitting
and we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   After walking eight batters in his previous start, Hill walked
only three Tuesday. However, he also hit three batters, including
two in one inning.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, the Tigers loaded the bases with no outs on a
single and two hit batters. But Hill got Damion Easley to hit into
a 1-2-3 double play. The Tigers still managed to score on a wild
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, he pitched a great game,'' Walbeck said. ``He threw
strikes, got ahead of hitters and had a great fastball. He kept us
in the game. As lethargic as our bats are, he did a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   Walbeck did all he could for Hill, hitting the homer, throwing
out two would-be base stealers and tagging out a runner at the
plate on an attempted double steal. But it wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the tough ones,'' Collins said. ``When you have
opportunities ... Dave pitched a great game, but we had some shots
tonight. We had chances where a base hit can put the game away. But
that's what's been happening to us.''

ASTROS TOP METS, 6-1 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If he could have just one pitch back from the seventh
inning on Tuesday night, Al Leiter said, it would not be the
two-run homer he surrendered to Derek Bell, or even the run-scoring
double from Craig Biggio that broke a 1-1 tie. It was a seemingly
harmless two-out pitch to the opposing pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   That pitch, which Mike Hampton hammered for a triple, opened the
way to the New York Mets' first defeat in seven games, a 6-1 loss
to the Houston Astros before an announced crowd of 27,192 on
another chilly night at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was definitely the pitch to Hampton,'' Leiter said, shaking
his head in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   The pitch was a fastball on a 1-0 count that Leiter left up in
the strike zone. Hampton blasted the ball over the head of the
Mets' center fielder, Brian McRae, and raced his way to third base,
standing up.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton (3-1) is a good hitter for a pitcher, one who batted
.262 last season. And considering that he was recruited to play
defensive back by Alabama and Notre Dame, Hampton _ according to
scouting reports _ might also be among the fastest-running pitchers
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   But the triple was just the second of Hampton's career in 236
major league at-bats (the first was off Orel Hershiser, who now
pitches for the Mets). His hit not only led the Astros to a
three-run outburst, all with two outs, but it also helped drop
Leiter to 1-3 on the year.
</P>
<P>
   On the first pitch after Hampton's triple, Leiter threw Biggio a
tough slider in on his hands, but Biggio was able to line it over
the glove of a leaping Robin Ventura, scoring Hampton. Bell
followed with his fifth homer of the season on a 3-1 fastball up.
The Astros had a 4-1 lead, and the Mets' season-best winning streak
was nearing its end at six games.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Hampton hit that triple, Al might have lost his
concentration a little bit,'' Mets Manager Bobby Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been on the other side, too,'' said Hampton, whose .273
average this year is nearly double Bobby Bonilla's .140. ``You
expect to get the pitcher out every time he comes to the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for expectations. This is not the sort of beginning to
the season that Leiter _ who wound up being charged with 6 runs and
11 hits in 7-plus innings _ had hoped for after winning a
career-best 17 games last season before re-signing with the Mets
for $32 million over the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the most earned runs Leiter allowed in any of his 28
starts was four. This season, he has allowed four earned runs once
and, after Tuesday night, six earned runs twice.
</P>
<P>
   In 40 innings covering six starts, Leiter has allowed 21 earned
runs. His earned run average is a bloated 4.73. Last season, it was
2.47, tied for third lowest in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   And, to think, Leiter could have escaped the seventh inning of a
1-1 game if he could have just made one good pitch to Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton, meanwhile, made seven innings full of them, allowing
the Mets just two hits. The first was an infield single to Edgardo
Alfonzo leading off the fourth. The second was a run-scoring single
off the end of Mike Piazza's bat with two out in the sixth that
briefly erased the Astros' 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But Bonilla _ who was booed again all night in his first game
since April 24 _ left runners on first and third when Hampton
struck him out to end the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   And then came the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, I'm upset at myself because I got two quick
outs,'' Leiter said. ``I'm thinking, `Great. I'm going to have a
1-2-3 inning and keep Biggio, Bell and Bagwell for the eighth.' And
then Hampton gets a triple.''
</P>
<P>
   And ruined Leiter's night.

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
With the lead slipping and the last hopes of home-court advantage
hanging in the balance, the Rockets took motivation seriously.
<TEXT>
<P>
   They began shooting the players.
</P>
<P>
   Never have the Rockets seemed so determined to hold on to a
lead. Less clear was why they waited so long to resort to such
extreme measures. That and how a Rockets point guard could be
involved in a freak accident and it not be Brent Price.
</P>
<P>
   But after Cuttino Mobley was shot by the team mascot in a
T-shirt giveaway, the Rockets brought out their own offensive
firepower to rebuild their lead and keep it growing in the second
half until taking a 100-83 win Tuesday night over the Minnesota
Timberwolves at Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   The win allowed the Rockets to keep pace with the Los Angeles
Lakers in their down-to-the-wire race for the home-court advantage
in the first round of the playoffs. The Lakers (30-19), hosting
Portland tonight, hold the tiebreaker on the Rockets (also 30-19),
who are at Denver tonight in the last game ever in McNichols Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to do their thing; we're going to do ours,''
Rockets forward Charles Barkley said of the race with the Lakers.
``When we play well, we can win anywhere. If we don't get it (the
home court), we can't whine and complain about it. We blew it
ourselves. We'll go to LA and play with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets seemed capable of winning on any court Tuesday night
when they got just the sort of momentum-building game they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Mobley not only survived a T-shirt shot upside his face, after
leaving the court for repairs he returned late in the first half.
(The Rockets Power Cannon/accident waiting to happen did not
reappear.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It shocked me, but I knew what hit me,'' Mobley said. ``I was
mad. He shoots it, but he doesn't know how to control it. It stung,
but it didn't hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Once back in the game, Mobley, who had 18 points, and fellow
rookie Michael Dickerson, who finished with a season-high 31, took
over the shooting for the night. Dickerson's 31 were the most for a
Rockets rookie since Hakeem Olajuwon in the 1984-85 season. He made
six of eight 3s, one shy of his Rockets rookie record, and had five
assists, also one from his personal best.
</P>
<P>
   ``My confidence is booming right now,'' Dickerson said. ``Last
night, I shot some extra shots, Sam Mack and I. He helped me with
my 3-point shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   But rather than merely catching a good night and taking
advantage of the usual double teams inside, Dickerson, Mobley and
Mack got open looks on the breaks and off drives inside and passes
back out.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets matched their season high with 32 assists. And
though they scored just 14 fast-break points, they again credited
their newfound taste for life in the fast lane for igniting their
offense, and especially Dickerson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two games are what I had in mind,'' Barkley said of
the emphasis on playing with greater pace and energy. ``The kid
(Dickerson) is too good a player to shoot 3s all night and not get
touches. He's capable of scoring 15 to 20 points a night on shots,
fast breaks and making 3s.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Running more) brings energy to the table. We need the young
guys to play with a lot of energy. The young guys got it going.
They played with emotion. It makes it easier for everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   In a thorough role reversal, they even made it easier for the
big men inside. Though each shooter was handed plenty of open looks
while circling the double teams inside, they also worked to find
and create their own shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were moving the ball around,'' Rockets coach Rudy
Tomjanovich said. ``A lot of times, there wasn't even a double team
(involved). It makes it easy when you shoot the ball so well.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson, especially, lit up the third quarter. He scored with
a three-point play, cutting to take a pass inside from Mobley, then
began to heat up. He scored on a break on a pass from Barkley, then
fired a 3 for a 61-50 Rockets lead.
</P>
<P>
   After Mobley nailed a trey, Dickerson added two, for 29 points
before the end of the quarter and a 10-point Rockets lead.
</P>
<P>
   That was enough for Timberwolves coach Flip Saunders, who called
off the double teams inside and paid for it. Barkley scored eight
of his 12 points in the first 4:09 of the fourth quarter. Olajuwon
hit a jumper and a pair of free throws, and with the Rockets up
86-70, Saunders went back to the double teams.
</P>
<P>
   That worked no better than it had in the third quarter. Mobley
immediately nailed a 3, then flipped a behind-the-back pass to
Scottie Pippen on the break. When Dickerson hit a short jumper in
the lane, he had 31 points, the Rockets led 93-71 and Saunders
called time out to allow both teams to begin clearing the benches
with 6:04 left.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they're knocking down their shots, they're a difficult
team to beat,'' Saunders said. ``They weren't shooting the ball
well lately, and that's why they were having troubles. When they're
playing well, they're usually shooting the ball well.''
</P>
<P>
   And should they slide again, they have a cartoonish bear with an
air cannon who is not afraid to use it.

TIBOR KALMAN, `BAD BOY' OF GRAPHIC DESIGN, DIES AT 49 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By STEVEN HELLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tibor Kalman, a graphic designer whose innovative ideas about
art and society helped change the way a generation of designers and
their clients viewed the world, died on Sunday at the Hyatt Dorado
Hotel near San Juan, P.R. He was 49 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Kalman decided to spend his last days in Puerto Rico after
losing a four-year bout with non-Hodgkins lymphoma, his wife, Maira
Kalman, said.
</P>
<P>
   The founder of M&AMP;Co, a revolutionary New York design firm that
became a social prod to his major clients as much as a graphics
resource, Kalman was also the former editor in chief of Colors
magazine, an art director and a director of music videos and
television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   He was the self-styled bad boy of the graphic design profession
and a harsh critic of formulaic or what he pejoratively termed
``professional'' design. He wanted designers to take greater
responsibility for how their work influenced the surrounding
culture. As the designer Milton Glaser asserted, ``He emerged in
such a short amount of time as a major influence on a young
generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Kalman described himself as more a social activist than a
designer and constantly sought to use his work to promote causes
like environmentalism and economic equality. He opposed products
that he considered harmful to the workers who made them, the
environment or the consumer and never hesitated to tell his clients
what he thought.
</P>
<P>
   After spending almost a decade building a business that he said
sold ``design by the pound'' to banks, discount department stores
and other institutions, Kalman reinvented M&AMP;Co in the mid-1980s as
a conceptually progressive firm doing graphics, exhibitions, books,
magazines and film titles primarily for cultural clients that
included the rock band Talking Heads, the Times Square
Redevelopment Corp. and the Whitney Museum of American Art.
</P>
<P>
   He also founded M&AMP;Co Labs, which conceived and manufactured
watches and clocks with quirky faces and rearranged numerals,
products that helped start a fashion for such designer-made
objects.
</P>
<P>
   Tibor Kalman was born in Budapest in 1949 and immigrated with
his family to Poughkeepsie, N.Y., in 1957 after the unsuccessful
Hungarian uprising against the Communist regime. He spent a year at
New York University, where he joined Students for a Democratic
Society and traveled to Cuba to pick cotton with the Venceremos
Brigade, which took middle-class Americans to help support the
Communists.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned to the United States in 1971, Kalman learned
rudimentary graphic design by doing window displays for the Student
Book Exchange at NYU, which was owned by Leonard Riggio, who later
bought Barnes &AMP; Noble and made Kalman its first creative director.
He designed the bookstore's first shopping bag, featuring an
antique woodcut of a scribe, which is still used today.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing little about the nuances of typography, however, Kalman
hired young design school graduates to execute his ideas while he
retained creative control, a practice he continued throughout his
career.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979 he was hired as the creative director responsible for
signs and displays for E.J. Korvettes, the discount department
store. Unhappy in this lucrative job, in 1980 he established M&AMP;Co
in his Greenwich Village apartment. A year later he moved it to an
office on West 57th Street in Manhattan. His first work was
designing logos for department stores for a bag manufacturer. But
Kalman was not content working on such commonplace assignments and
decided to change his focus.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's enigmatic name was typical of Kalman's wit. The
corporate-sounding cadence was meant to give an aura of mystery and
to confuse his more strait-laced clientele, who always wanted to
know who the M was. His wife, Maira, a children's book author and
illustrator, has the nickname ``M,'' which she donated to the
cause.
</P>
<P>
   Kalman's new office was designed to establish an unconventional
aura and featured what he called ``a goofy, triangular-shaped table
that fit into a goofy-shaped conference room,'' as well as a hole
smashed out of one wall by a sledge hammer for a reception window.
</P>
<P>
   Kalman's metamorphosis into a progressive design impresario came
when M&AMP;Co designed a Talking Heads album that featured four
digitally manipulated photographs of the group members (before
personal computer software made this a common graphic conceit) and
a title with upside-down letters. From then on, M&AMP;Co received
attention in the design trade press for pushing beyond the
conventions of design and typography.
</P>
<P>
   Kalman soon moved his office to a downtown loft that he had
designed to simulate the interior of an old factory. This was
consistent with his passion for vernacular design. He encouraged
his designers to apply the handmade signs and common methods used
by neighborhood printers who do menus and handbills. Ultimately,
vernacularism became a way for him to protest the corporate
International Style.
</P>
<P>
   As a frequent lecturer and a writer of acerbic manifestoes,
Kalman urged designers to take more responsibility for their work's
impact on society and culture. In 1986 he was co-chairman of the
American Institute of Graphic Arts' national conference in San
Antonio, called ``Dangerous Ideas.'' It was the first such major
event to focus attention on how designers contribute to
environmental waste and promote products that harm people or the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   M&AMP;Co became Kalman's soapbox. To address homelessness, he sent
boxes with the contents of a typical city shelter meal to clients
one Christmas season instead of the usual presents, noting that
M&AMP;Co would match all monetary contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Graphic design was too small a platform for Kalman. He gradually
moved away from graphics as such to editing and creative direction
for the magazines Art Forum and Interview. But perhaps his most
meaningful job was as editor in chief of Colors, the Italian and
English magazine published by the Italian clothing company
Benetton, an assignment that forced him to discontinue M&AMP;Co
temporarily and move his family to Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Colors, founded by a photographer, Oliviero Toscani, was not a
typical corporate house organ or fashion magazine, but rather
focused on sociocultural issues like racism, AIDS and even sports.
Colors was ``the first magazine for the global village,'' Kalman
said, ``aimed at an audience of flexible minds, young people from
14 to 20, or curious people of any age.''
</P>
<P>
   Colors became the main outlet for Kalman's ideas. An issue
devoted to racism had a feature titled ``How to Change Your Race''
and examined cosmetic means of altering hair, features and skin
color to achieve some kind of platonic ideal.
</P>
<P>
   Also in that issue, ``What If. . .,'' was a collection of
manipulated photographs showing famous people racially transformed:
Queen Elizabeth and Arnold Schwarzenegger as black; Pope John Paul
II as Asian; Spike Lee as white and Michael Jackson with a Nordic
cast. ``Race is not the real issue here,'' Kalman said. ``Power and
sex are the dominant forces in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Kalman returned to New York in 1997 after three years as Colors
editor to battle cancer. He re-established M&AMP;Co to produce and
design exhibits, videos and books that had social relevance. Among
his projects was a photographic series quoting everyday people's
relationship to Times Square, which hung on scaffolding during the
recent construction of the Conde Nast building in Times Square, and
a series of Op Art contributions to The New York Times Op-Ed page.
</P>
<P>
   During his cancer treatments he also taught a pictorial
narrative class to graduate students at the School of Visual Arts
and directed work on his monograph, ``Tibor Kalman: Perverse
Optimist.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Lulu
Bodoni, and a son, Alex Onomatopoeia; his parents, Marianne and
George Kalman of Gwyned, Pa.; a brother, John of Horsham, Pa., and
a sister, Margie of Bristol, Pa. In the last months of his life,
Kalman designed the exhibition ``Tiborocity,'' which will open at
the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in July. It will consist of
``neighborhoods'' representing different aspects of his work as
well as the protest posters and graphics that influenced him in the
1960s and 70s. Kalman told friends he intended this retrospective
to be his last testament.  &QL;

HARRY L. KAVETAS, 61, KODAK'S FINANCE CHIEF 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harry L. Kavetas, the chief financial officer who helped lead
the Eastman Kodak Co. through a huge financial upheaval that
involved sweeping job cuts over the last few years, died on Tuesday
at his home in Rochester, N.Y. He was 61.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was an apparent heart attack, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he had been with Kodak only since 1994, Kavetas was
credited with helping to engineer the strategies that helped the
company dig out from under a huge debt load and stem a precipitous
drop in its share of the American film market. As part of the
management team of George M.C. Fisher, Kodak's chief executive,
Kavetas helped the company capitalize on the growth of digital
photography. He was also deeply involved in Kodak's wrenching
decision, announced in 1997, to cut 19,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terrible to lose someone of Harry's quality at a time
when the company has so many balls in the air,'' said B. Alexander
Henderson, an analyst who follows Kodak for Prudential Securities
Research.
</P>
<P>
   On joining Kodak, Kavetas began finding ways to pay down more
than $5 billion in debt from Kodak's 1988 purchase of Sterling
Drug.
</P>
<P>
   He helped spearhead Kodak's decision to divest itself of huge
chunks of its health business and, just this year, to sell its
copier business. He was also very involved in the decision,
announced in 1997, to pare as many as 19,000 jobs _ a decision that
would be painful for any company but that was excruciating for
Kodak, which had run so paternalistic an organization that its
nickname in its home town, Rochester, was ``Great Yellow Father.''
</P>
<P>
   Kavetas, a native of Springfield, Ill., had a bachelor's degree
in finance and economics from the University of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining Kodak, he spent 32 years with the International
Business Machines Corp., rising steadily up the ranks. When he took
early retirement from there in December 1993, he was chief
executive of the IBM Credit Corp. Kodak hired him two months later.
</P>
<P>
   Kavetas was elected a Kodak executive vice president in
September 1994, just seven months after joining the company. In May
1997 he was elected to Kodak's board.
</P>
<P>
   Kavetas is survived by his wife, Sue; two daughters, Betsy
Kavetas and Kathy Rothchild; a son, James, and three grandchildren.

SPRING RITE TAKEN FROM SEATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Early in the game last week at KeyArena, Utah coach
Jerry Sloan pulled Greg Ostertag from the floor after the Jazz
center fluffed a layup that should have been a dunk.
</P>
<P>
   As Ostertag took a seat on the bench, player and coach bickered
for a couple of moments. Then Sloan ended the discussion with the
finality of a 50-mph mudslide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just dunk the (deleted) ball,'' he shouted, staring directly
into Ostertag's eyes, ``and shut the (deleted) up.''
</P>
<P>
   What a powerful moment. What a perfect vignette for Sloan and a
superb metaphor for the continuing success of the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   What a great thing to repeat to the Seattle SuperSonics.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, let the whole league hear it.
</P>
<P>
   I'm tired of fat players, soft players, achy players, guys who
don't play hard all the time, guys who can't make free throws,
coaches who rationalize and cover up, and executives helpless to
manage the mess.
</P>
<P>
   I'm especially tired of the scene in a year when owners locked
out the ego monsters they created, then unlocked the monsters to
stumble over themselves while charging the public full price.
</P>
<P>
   Am I little cranky?
</P>
<P>
   Yup. Been cranky all season. Watching the Sonics, the league's
most disappointing team _ remember, the Chicago Bulls planned to be
horrific _ cranked up the crankiness.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of who or what is saddled with blame for the
butchery, the worst thing about it from a fan perspective was the
Sonics cashiered the one steady highlight of the local sports
calendar _ the NBA playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   For the last nine seasons, Seattle's oldest and most
tradition-rich pro franchise provided a steady spring stream of
entertainment by inviting Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley, Karl
Malone, John Stockton, Clyde Drexler, Hakeem Olajuwon, Kevin
Garnett, Jason Kidd and Dikembe Mutombo, among many others, to an
irresistibly unpredictable hoops party.
</P>
<P>
   Freakish as was Dennis Rodman, his play and his circus in June
1996, will never be forgotten by all who bore witness.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Shawn Kemp grow from shaky fawn against Portland's Buck
Williams in 1991 to virtual co-MVP with Jordan in the '96 Finals
was a rich treat for the long-term Sonic investor.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing Gary Payton carry a flagging team past a desperately
eager Minnesota unit last spring was a rare demonstration of pure
force of will.
</P>
<P>
   Remember Game 4 of the first-round series in 1997 in Phoenix,
when Rex Chapman threw in an off-balance, running 28-footer to tie
the game, only to see the Sonics win in overtime? I'm not sure if
that result was more confounding than one on the same America West
Arena floor four years earlier, the seventh game of the Western
Conference finals, which the Suns won 123-110 because of a huge
disparity in free throws that assured a made-for-TV Barkley-Jordan
Finals.
</P>
<P>
   How about the 3-2 first-round win over a favored Golden State
team in '92 that ushered in the Sonics as an NBA power? Or the 4-0
second-round sweep of defending champion Houston in '96 that made
the Sonics look limitless?
</P>
<P>
   Even the astonishing defeats, such as 1994's first-round loss to
the eighth-seeded Nuggets, were epic sports spectacles.
</P>
<P>
   Spoiled? Sure. That's a big virtue of big-time spectator sports.
Expectations can be indulged without fear of consequence to
anything truly meaningful.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly all of this decade, the Sonics engaged their
following in a tumultuous run through spring whitewater that
annually threw the fans overboard with the always-overboard George
Karl _ only to see all pull themselves back and ask to do it again.
</P>
<P>
   Please, don't write me about the cyclical nature of sports.
Every moron knows that. That all sports franchises screw up doesn't
eliminate the annoying reality that the Sonics have broken with
their tradition right now.
</P>
<P>
   The void is something of a screamer, particularly given the
other local voids.
</P>
<P>
   In a year that saw the Seahawks go 8-8, the Husky footballers go
6-6, the Husky men's basketballers go 17-14 and the Mariners flail
around .500 in the worst division in sports, the Sonics were
expected to be the go-to guys for big-time sports fun beyond the
vast ooze of Seattle mediocrity.
</P>
<P>
   Until Monday, the Sonics had the sixth-longest active streak in
the NBA for consecutive playoff appearances. While it can be argued
that only championships count, their steady presence in the
playoffs was not just a point of pride about consistency, but was a
growing sports tradition in a relatively tradition-free part of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, for reasons already well-chronicled that will be
relentlessly rehashed in the coming days as fingers get pointed
(and raised), the party will go on in Portland, San Antonio and 14
other cities while the Sonics share draft-lottery intrigue with the
Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   Cranky? Spoiled? You betcha, Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   As my man Sloan was saying, just dunk the stinkin' ball, and
shut the hell up.
</P>
<P>
   But in the absence of an opportunity to dunk ...

DISNEY TRIAL TESTIMONY GETS NASTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PETER HARTLAUB  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael Eisner testified
he may have aimed the statement ``I hate the little midget'' at
former studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg and vowed not to pay him
bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   In the extraordinary showdown Tuesday between two of Hollywood's
most powerful men, Eisner also said he didn't recall seeing most of
the documents that Katzenberg says proves Disney owes him more than
$250 million.
</P>
<P>
   Confronted with notes taken by his biographer, Eisner conceded
he might have made the ``midget'' comment about Katzenberg, who is
shorter than Eisner. The notes indicate his response to
Katzenberg's dispute over the contract was: ``I don't care what he
thinks, (I'm not) going to pay him any of the money.''
</P>
<P>
   The statements, read by Katzenberg lawyer Bert Fields, never
made it into Eisner's autobiography, ``Work in Progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisner responded to Fields' tactic with a stern warning,
suggesting the line of questioning was ``ill-advised.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To characterize me as hating him is absurd, and is going down
a direction that I think is not in your client's best interest or
mine, but particularly your client's,'' Eisner told Fields. ``But
that's up to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisner sought to downplay the feud with Katzenberg. He said he
only recalled two face-to-face arguments with Katzenberg _ both
toward the end of the studio chief's tenure at Disney.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it's like a dentist,'' Eisner said. ``You forget
pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning by Disney's lawyer, Eisner testified that
Katzenberg had a ``dark side,'' but stressed that the comments he
made to book collaborator Tony Schwartz were meant to stay private.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg, who worked at Disney from 1984 to 1994, claims he
brought the studio ``from worst to first'' during his tenure, but
was never paid a multimillion-dollar bonus based on his division's
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Disney claims Katzenberg lost that bonus when he left the
company two years before his contract was finished.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the lawsuit was settled last year, but both sides agreed
to let a retired judge decide a few final issues, including
Katzenberg's fraud claim and a dispute over merchandising profits.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner's fiery testimony came at the end of what had been a
relatively uneventful day in the week-old trial.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning from Disney lawyer Louis Meisinger, Eisner
said he became angry with Katzenberg because he believed him to be
playing ``media games.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisner said he once received a fax from Katzenberg that was
intended for Fields, thanking the lawyer for his help in dealing
with the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was just one of the dark sides of an otherwise
exceptional executive,'' Eisner said.

LAME DUCK SONICS WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ There were no lineup changes to question. The injuries
were inconsequential, and for the first time so was the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Quality of play was important. But making sharp defensive reads
or crunch-time baskets were nowhere near vital.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics finally played a plain and simple game _ one they won
110-100 Tuesday night against the Dallas Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, this is how a season winds down when you have
been eliminated from the playoffs. The Sonics missed the postseason
for the first time since the 1989-90 season.
</P>
<P>
   The unfamiliar situation compelled Sonics coach Paul Westphal to
give the team's younger players heavy minutes.
</P>
<P>
   He already had begun to take a hard look at what went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fairest criticism is that we didn't find a way to overcome
adversity,'' Westphal said. ``Somehow, some way we didn't get the
job done. Whether it was losing in Vancouver or making a defensive
breakdown. ... The fairest criticism is we did it to ourselves. We
didn't overcome adversity well enough to get into the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Sonics conclude their regular season Wednesday night in
Los Angeles against the Clippers, they will play for a respectable
record. They can finish the year 25-25, and avoid a below-.500
record. The last time the Sonics turned in a losing season was
1986-87.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to finish strong,'' guard Hersey Hawkins said.
``Everybody did a great job tonight of trying to be aggressive and
playing hard. Everybody knew the circumstances we were under, so I
was happy about the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics controlled the game from start to finish. They led
38-27 after the first quarter, and were never seriously threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the team's predicament is a bitter pill for Westphal to
swallow. He certainly could never have fathomed missing the
playoffs in his return to NBA coaching.
</P>
<P>
   He has been asked the question, ``What happened?'' a thousand
times and the barrage will continue until next season begins.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal points to the 50-game schedule and, most of all, to
injuries as the reasons the Sonics were derailed.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he can't help but think of a couple of games. Like when
the Sonics could have beaten the Los Angeles Lakers at the Forum
March 5. The Sonics lost that game 103-100 because they allowed the
Lakers to cherry-pick and score easy layups down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there are the missed free throws.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics shot 68 percent from the line this season. That has
nothing to do with being out of shape or playing five games in five
nights.
</P>
<P>
   Just think what could have happened if the team had scored 100
more points from the foul line.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's fair,'' Westphal said. ``To me the only thing that's
unfair is when people don't get their facts right and then build a
case.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from winning their final regular-season home game, the
Sonics gave younger teammembers playing time.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Vladimir Stepania started at center with Vin Baker, Don
MacLean, Gary Payton and Hersey Hawkins. Rookie forward Jelani
McCoy played significant minutes off the bench as did third-string
point guard Drew Barry.
</P>
<P>
   Stepania showed just how much he has improved since the
beginning of the season. He scored 17 points and grabbed 10
rebounds. More impressive was that Stepania played 34 minutes.
Earlier this season he would have fouled out before logging that
much time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I as nervous,'' Stepania said. ``But as the game went on I
felt OK. This season has been a big experience for me. I think I'll
be OK next season.''
</P>
<P>
   The team will activate rookie Rashard Lewis, who could be
inserted into the starting lineup Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got some good performances from the young guys, which is
something to build on,'' Westphal said.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it's time to forget this season.

SCORE 25,000-plus NBA points and have a spiffy banner bearing your
name raised to the rafters, and you, too, can enjoy what Hakeem
Olajuwon enjoyed Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Comp time.
</P>
<P>
   He did what he needed to do, then let the kids handle the rest.
He rebounded like the champion he is. He threw in 17 points. He
blocked and altered a few shots.
</P>
<P>
   He got up the floor for some honest-to-goodness hard work,
banging with all the young studs from Minnesota who really thought
they had a chance. They didn't.
</P>
<P>
   But this was the stuff of Dream in more ways than one. This was
how it was supposed to work all year long.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets won, the Rockets ran, the rookies shot lights-out,
and Olajuwon turned in a mere 32 minutes, laughing away the final
few ticks of this 100-83 laugher from the bench.
</P>
<P>
   This was the stuff that makes the Rockets dream about all sorts
of possibilities for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the young guys get going and get emotional, it makes it
easier on all the older guys,'' Charles Barkley said. ``This was a
game when we were at our best.''
</P>
<P>
   This was Olajuwon rebounding defensively and turning and
throwing the ball up the floor and rookies Michael Dickerson and
Cuttino Mobley finishing so many fast breaks with authority.
</P>
<P>
   This was Barkley backing it in, backing it in, forcing the poor
Timberwolves to double-team him, then laughing through his
mouthpiece while finding Dickerson outside the arc for a wide-open
3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles told us we need to start getting the ball up and down
the floor,'' Dickerson said. ``We're trying. I love it. We play
better when we're going up and down the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson sank 10 of 18 shots for a career-high 31 points, the
most by a Rockets rookie since 1984-1985, Olajuwon's first season.
Mobley hit six of 10 shots en route to 18 points _ this despite
being wounded in action when Clutch, the furry mascot with a death
wish, accidentally shot a T-shirt from a cannon at Mobley's jaw in
the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: The trio of Olajuwon, Barkley and Scottie Pippen
combined for one more shot but made one fewer field goal than
Dickerson and Mobley.
</P>
<P>
   But everyone was in agreement afterward that this was a good
thing. This was the stuff of dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``All night, I was getting the ball and wasn't hesitating,''
Dickerson said. ``I got kind of hot, and they started looking for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this season, Dickerson admitted he rarely had the
confidence to demand the ball and take the big shots. Olajuwon,
Barkley and Pippen were, after all, players whom Dickerson idolized
as a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't know me, and I didn't know them,'' Dickerson said.
``I had to earn their confidence. Tonight, to be honest, Hakeem was
the one that got me going. I didn't take one shot (early), and he
started telling me, `Take that shot. You have to take that shot.'''
</P>
<P>
   After so many ups and downs in 1999, so many plodding efforts on
both ends, it was the second consecutive game in which the Rockets
seemed to find a nice balance. There they were, shuffling back and
forth between the post-up game that makes Olajuwon and Barkley
happy and the running, shooting, passing effort that might be the
answer for the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we move the ball around,'' Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich
said, ``it makes it easy.''
</P>
<P>
   It looked it. As huge as Olajuwon was on his night, it all
seemed effortless. As nice a game as Barkley had (12 points, eight
rebounds), his most impressive statistic clearly was his six
assists. In fact, going into the fourth quarter, the Rockets as a
team had hit 28 field goals _ 26 of them coming off an assist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to win (in the playoffs) like this team did
five years ago,'' Barkley said. ``We can't win that way anymore. We
can't play that game. We have to get out running with the guys we
have. Scottie can run, Cuttino can run, and Dickerson is real
athletic and can shoot. When we run, Dickerson can help us a lot
more than ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   It's what happened Tuesday, and it couldn't have come at a
better time. The Dream got to enjoy the final few minutes of his
night from the bench. Dickerson had a career night. Everyone
pitched in _ inside, outside, up and down.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone could dream. The playoffs are just around the corner,
and the Rockets might finally be turning the corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two or three times this year, I've felt like I felt tonight,''
Dickerson said. ``I've felt like I could shoot and hit everything,
but the shots weren't always there. Tonight, it came to me.
Hopefully, we'll keep playing like we did tonight.''

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was so utterly predictable. Up to 60 civilians are torn apart
in a NATO bombing attack on Saturday and Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic releases three captured American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   And which event _ the tragedy or the melodrama _ do we regard as
more important? The freeing of three Americans, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Even Sunday's NATO briefing spent more time discussing the
implications of their release than the bus massacre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any loss of innocent life is regretted,'' German Colonel
Konrad Freytag announced. Note the passive tense ``it is
regretted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not bomb the bus,'' the colonel announced, adding that
the bridge was ``a military target.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We bombed the bridge... We did not bomb the bus and we did not
target the bus.'' So that's all right then.
</P>
<P>
   How much longer will NATO get away with these dreadful attacks?
Aleksinac, Cuprija, the train massacre at Grdelica, the assault on
the civilian center of Pristina, the bombs dropped near Belgrade
university, the slaughter of Albanian refugees near Djakovica, the
mass killings in the air raid at Surdulica and now the bus blown
apart on the Lujane bridge...
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs are making good headway with their propaganda: that
NATO is deliberately trying to kill innocent Serbs. And what do we
get from Colonel Freytag? ``It is regretted.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO's sorrow, we are supposed to believe, is reserved for the
continuing exodus of Albanian refugees from Kosovo, for the
three-quarters of a million Kosovo Albanian refugees hounded from
their homes, executed, raped, dispossessed.
</P>
<P>
   I would like to believe that NATO feels this sense of outrage as
strongly as it claims. But I don't _ and after five weeks in
Yugoslavia, here's why.
</P>
<P>
   If I am walking down a street in London or Dublin or any other
European city and I see a man molesting a woman or trying to kill
an innocent civilian, I hope I would, like most ``Independent''
readers no doubt, cross the road and try _ whatever the cost _ to
save the life of the innocent person. But that has not been NATO's
reaction to the plight of the Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   What NATO has done _ faced with the atrocities of Kosovo _ has
been to stay on the other side of the road, to make a note of the
criminal's address, and to throw stones through the window of his
home later that night.
</P>
<P>
   NATO sometimes damages the house, sometimes destroys it. Quite
often, in the dark, it throws stones through the windows of the
wrong house and hurts or kills those who are every bit as innocent
as the original victim. In which case NATO says that ``it is
regretted.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a single NATO life has been lost in five weeks of war in the
Balkans _ because we do not regard the catastrophe of the Kosovo
Albanians as worth a single NATO life. It is as simple as that.
</P>
<P>
   We do not want a ground war and there will not be a ground war
(unless the Kosovo Liberation Army are obliging enough to die for
us).
</P>
<P>
   Nothing wrong with that, perhaps. But we do not say so. Instead,
we are told why we must go on bombing day after day, week after
week, in NATO briefings that are becoming parodies of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Even the word NATO is becoming a lie. The alliance is bombarding
Yugoslavia, we are told. Is it?
</P>
<P>
   In the past five weeks in Serbia, I haven't seen any Portuguese
planes dropping bombs on the Serbs. I haven't seen any Spanish jets
rocketing Belgrade. Nor a single French jet. Nor Norwegian. Nor
Greek. Nor Italian.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of British Harriers and Canadian planes, perhaps. But
the rest are American. For in terms of a military offensive, this
is essentially an American attack on Yugoslavia, using American
aircraft dropping American bombs.
</P>
<P>
   So what could have been more important Sunday _ amid the
continuing war crimes in Kosovo _ than the release of three
American soldiers?
</P>
<P>
   Now it happens that I have seen Jesse Jackson in action before.
Last time, he was arranging the release of a U.S. pilot captured by
the Syrians in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson turned up in Damascus talking about ``the cycle of
pain,'' met with Syrian President Hafez Assad, said a few prayers
and left with the man whose hi-tech jet had been shot down over
Lebanon by a Second World War anti-aircraft gun.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with President Milosevic, Jackson talked about
``the cycle of pain,'' said a few prayers and left with the three
American soldiers captured on the Serbian-Macedonian border.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Assad, however, Milosevic handed Jackson a letter for the
American president _ a letter which Bill Clinton will not like to
read.
</P>
<P>
   For negotiating with Milosevic, sitting down with the man now
bestialized as the Hitler of Belgrade _ when will we ever learn to
stop playacting the Second World War? _ is now impossible for the
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   He is too terrible, his regime too ``bloodstained,'' his word so
unreliable for anyone to trust him to talk peace. Or so we are led
to believe.
</P>
<P>
   But what is he offering? An ``international force'' in Kosovo, I
suspect, under U.N. mandate but with no NATO participation and with
_ at most _ side arms for personal protection.
</P>
<P>
   It will be refused (as Milosevic will expect it to be refused)
but it will probably form the basis of peace, once NATO admits that
there will be no ground war.
</P>
<P>
   The truth, unfortunately for NATO, is that _ barring coups
d'etat or a Western-provoked uprising in Montenegro or mass
desertions from the Yugoslav army _ the Serbs look set to grit
their teeth and take more American bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. is probably the only hope the Kosovo Albanians now have
of getting back to their homes _ some of them, that is, those who
might be able to claim citizenship of Yugoslavia or who might be
prepared to return without hope of independence or even real
autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   They will not expect any apologies from the Serbs for the
``ethnic cleansing'' of the past five weeks. And should they ask
NATO why so many Albanians had to be murdered while the alliance
bombed, I can imagine the reply they will receive. ``It is
regretted.'' &QL;

 By ROBERT FISK  
 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was so utterly predictable. Up to 60 civilians are torn apart
in a NATO bombing attack on Saturday and Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic releases three captured American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   And which event _ the tragedy or the melodrama _ do we regard as
more important? The freeing of three Americans, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Even Sunday's NATO briefing spent more time discussing the
implications of their release than the bus massacre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any loss of innocent life is regretted,'' German Colonel
Konrad Freytag announced. Note the passive tense ``it is
regretted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not bomb the bus,'' the colonel announced, adding that
the bridge was ``a military target.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We bombed the bridge... We did not bomb the bus and we did not
target the bus.'' So that's all right then.
</P>
<P>
   How much longer will NATO get away with these dreadful attacks?
Aleksinac, Cuprija, the train massacre at Grdelica, the assault on
the civilian center of Pristina, the bombs dropped near Belgrade
university, the slaughter of Albanian refugees near Djakovica, the
mass killings in the air raid at Surdulica and now the bus blown
apart on the Lujane bridge...
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs are making good headway with their propaganda: that
NATO is deliberately trying to kill innocent Serbs. And what do we
get from Colonel Freytag? ``It is regretted.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO's sorrow, we are supposed to believe, is reserved for the
continuing exodus of Albanian refugees from Kosovo, for the
three-quarters of a million Kosovo Albanian refugees hounded from
their homes, executed, raped, dispossessed.
</P>
<P>
   I would like to believe that NATO feels this sense of outrage as
strongly as it claims. But I don't _ and after five weeks in
Yugoslavia, here's why.
</P>
<P>
   If I am walking down a street in London or Dublin or any other
European city and I see a man molesting a woman or trying to kill
an innocent civilian, I hope I would, like most ``Independent''
readers no doubt, cross the road and try _ whatever the cost _ to
save the life of the innocent person. But that has not been NATO's
reaction to the plight of the Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   What NATO has done _ faced with the atrocities of Kosovo _ has
been to stay on the other side of the road, to make a note of the
criminal's address, and to throw stones through the window of his
home later that night.
</P>
<P>
   NATO sometimes damages the house, sometimes destroys it. Quite
often, in the dark, it throws stones through the windows of the
wrong house and hurts or kills those who are every bit as innocent
as the original victim. In which case NATO says that ``it is
regretted.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a single NATO life has been lost in five weeks of war in the
Balkans _ because we do not regard the catastrophe of the Kosovo
Albanians as worth a single NATO life. It is as simple as that.
</P>
<P>
   We do not want a ground war and there will not be a ground war
(unless the Kosovo Liberation Army are obliging enough to die for
us).
</P>
<P>
   Nothing wrong with that, perhaps. But we do not say so. Instead,
we are told why we must go on bombing day after day, week after
week, in NATO briefings that are becoming parodies of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Even the word NATO is becoming a lie. The alliance is bombarding
Yugoslavia, we are told. Is it?
</P>
<P>
   In the past five weeks in Serbia, I haven't seen any Portuguese
planes dropping bombs on the Serbs. I haven't seen any Spanish jets
rocketing Belgrade. Nor a single French jet. Nor Norwegian. Nor
Greek. Nor Italian.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of British Harriers and Canadian planes, perhaps. But
the rest are American. For in terms of a military offensive, this
is essentially an American attack on Yugoslavia, using American
aircraft dropping American bombs.
</P>
<P>
   So what could have been more important Sunday _ amid the
continuing war crimes in Kosovo _ than the release of three
American soldiers?
</P>
<P>
   Now it happens that I have seen Jesse Jackson in action before.
Last time, he was arranging the release of a U.S. pilot captured by
the Syrians in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson turned up in Damascus talking about ``the cycle of
pain,'' met with Syrian President Hafez Assad, said a few prayers
and left with the man whose hi-tech jet had been shot down over
Lebanon by a Second World War anti-aircraft gun.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with President Milosevic, Jackson talked about
``the cycle of pain,'' said a few prayers and left with the three
American soldiers captured on the Serbian-Macedonian border.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Assad, however, Milosevic handed Jackson a letter for the
American president _ a letter which Bill Clinton will not like to
read.
</P>
<P>
   For negotiating with Milosevic, sitting down with the man now
bestialized as the Hitler of Belgrade _ when will we ever learn to
stop playacting the Second World War? _ is now impossible for the
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   He is too terrible, his regime too ``bloodstained,'' his word so
unreliable for anyone to trust him to talk peace. Or so we are led
to believe.
</P>

   But what is he offering? An ``international force'' in Kosovo, I

KOSOVO REBEL ARMY LINKED TO ENORMOUS HEROIN TRADE  
  
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK VIVIANO  
 c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Officers of the Kosovo Liberation Army and their backers, according
to law enforcement authorities in Western Europe and the United
States, are a major force in international organized crime, moving
staggering amounts of narcotics through an underworld network that
reaches into the heart of Europe.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the words of a November 1997 statement issued by Interpol,
the international police agency, ``Kosovo Albanians hold the
largest share of the heroin market in Switzerland, in Austria, in
Belgium, in Germany, in Hungary, in the Czech Republic, in Norway
and in Sweden.''
</P>
<P>
   That the Albanians of Kosovo are victims of a conscious,
ethnic-cleansing campaign set in motion by Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic is clear. But the credentials of some who claim
to represent them are profoundly disturbing, say highly placed
sources on both sides of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   On March 25 _ the day after NATO's bombardment of Serb forces
began _ drug enforcement experts from the Hague-based European
Office of Police (EUROPOL), met in an emergency closed session
devoted to ``Kosovar Narcotics Trafficking Networks.''
</P>
<P>
   EUROPOL is preparing an extensive report for European justice
and interior ministers on the KLA's role in heroin smuggling.
Independent investigations of the charges are also under way in
Sweden, Germany and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have intelligence leading us to believe that there could be
a connection between drug money and the Kosovo Liberation Army,''
Walter Kege, head of the drug enforcement unit in the Swedish
police intelligence service, told the London Times in late March.
</P>
<P>
   As long as four years ago, U.S. officials were concerned about
alleged ties between narcotics syndicates and the People's Movement
of Kosovo, a dissident political organization founded in 1982 that
is now the KLA's political wing.
</P>
<P>
   A 1995 advisory by the federal Drug Enforcement Administration
warned of the possibility ``that certain members of the ethnic
Albanian community in the Serbian region of Kosovo have turned to
drug trafficking in order to finance their separatist activities.''
</P>
<P>
   If the drug-running allegations against the KLA are accurate,
the group could join a rogues' gallery of former U.S. allies whose
interests outside the battlefield brought deep embarrassment and
domestic political turmoil to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In 1944, the invading U.S. Army handed the reins of power in
Sicily to local ``anti-fascists'' who were in fact Mafia leaders.
During the next half century, American governments also turned a
blind eye to, or collaborated with, the narcotics operations of
Southeast Asian drug lords and Nicaraguan Contras who were allied
with the United States in Indochina and Central America.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, the legacy of these partnerships ranged from
global expansion of the power wielded by criminal syndicates, to
divisive congressional inquiries at home and lasting suspicion of
American intentions overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The involvement of ethnic Albanians in the drug trade is not
exclusively Kosovar. It includes members of Albanian communities in
Europe's three poorest countries or regions _ Kosovo, Macedonia and
Albania _ where the appeal of narcotics trafficking is
self-explanatory, even without a separatist war to fund.
</P>
<P>
   The average 1997 monthly salary in all three communities was
less than $200. In Albania, it was less than $50.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Paris-based Geopolitical Drug Watch, which
advises the governments of Britain and France on illegal narcotics
operations, one kilogram (2.2 pounds) of heroin costs $8,300 in
Albania, which lies at the western terminus of a ``Balkan Route''
that today accounts for up to 90 percent of the drug's exports to
Europe from Southeast Asia and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Across the border from Albania in Greece, the same kilo of
heroin can be sold for $30,000, yielding an instant profit equal to
nine years' normal income in Macedonia and more than a third of a
century in Albania or prebombardment Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Balkan Route is a principal thoroughfare for an illicit drug
traffic worth $400 billion annually, according to Interpol.
</P>
<P>
   Although only a small number of ethnic Albanian clans profit
directly from the trade, their activities have cast a dark shadow
on the entire Albanian world.
</P>
<P>
   There is a growing tendency among foreign observers, says former
Albanian President Sali Berisha, ``to identify the criminal with
the honest, the vandal with the civilized, the mafiosi with the
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Those ethnic Albanians who have embraced the narcotics trade are
extraordinarily aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   Albanian speakers make up roughly 1 percent of Europe's 510
million people. In 1997, according to Interpol, they made up 14
percent of all European arrests for heroin trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   The average quantity of heroin confiscated per arrest, among all
offenders, was less than two grams. Among Albanian-speakers, the
figure was 120 grams (4.2 ounces).
</P>
<P>
   Until the war intervened, Kosovars were the acknowledged masters
of the trade, credited with shoving aside the Turkish gangs that
had long dominated narcotics trafficking along the Balkan Route,
and effectively directing the ethnic Albanian network.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovar bosses ``orchestrated the traffic, regulated the rate
and set the prices,'' according to journalist Leonardo Coen, who
covers racketeering and organized crime in the Balkans for the
Italian daily La Repubblica.(cq)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kosovars had a 10-year head start on their cousins across
the border, simply because their Yugoslav passports allowed them to
travel earlier and much more widely than someone from communist
Albania,'' said Michel Koutouzis, a senior researcher at
Geopolitical Drug Watch who is regarded as Europe's leading expert
on the Balkan Route.
</P>
<P>
   ``That allowed them to establish very efficient overseas
networks through the worldwide Albanian diaspora _ and in the
process, to forge ties with other underworld groups involved in the
heroin trade, such as Chinese triads in Vancouver and Vietnamese in
Australia,'' Koutouzis told The Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   On assignments in Kosovo and Macedonia between 1992 and 1996, a
Chronicle reporter frequently encountered groups of ethnic Albanian
men _ ostentatiously dressed in designer clothing and driving
luxury cars far beyond the normal means of their community _ at
restaurants in the Macedonian capital of Skopje and near the Kosovo
frontier.
</P>
<P>
   The men were quite willing to speak about politics, confirming
that they were Kosovar, and asserting their determination to bring
down Milosevic. But when asked how they earned their livings, they
uniformly answered ``in business,'' declining to provide any
details.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of Kosovar bosses to the pinnacle of the drug trade _
and the sudden, simultaneous appearance of the KLA _ dates from
1997, when the Berisha government fell in Albania amid nationwide
rioting over a collapsed financial pyramid scheme that destroyed
the savings of millions and wrecked the economy. In the unchecked
looting that followed, the nation's armories were emptied of
weapons, explosives and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1997, Berisha was succeeded as president by Rexhep
Mejdani, who unlike Berisha was openly sympathetic to a separatist
rebellion in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a NATO official in Brussels quoted by Radio Free
Europe cited intelligence findings of ``the wholesale transfer of
weapons to Kosovo'' in 1997, destabilizing the precarious balance
between ethnic Albanians and Serbs in the province and undercutting
the position of pacifist Kosovo leader Ibrahim Rugova in autonomy
negotiations with Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   A U.N. study found that at least 200,000 Kalashnikov automatic
assault weapons stolen from Albanian military armories wound up in
the KLA arsenal. So many, according to reliable sources, that KLA
operatives were themselves exporting guns to overseas black markets
at the start of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the KLA's armed insurgency, escalating at a time when
U.S. and Western European diplomats were seeking a peaceful
solution to the crisis, provided a pretext for Milosevic to press
for a nationalist solution to the Kosovo problem.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the failed Rambouillet talks, the NATO bombing
decision, and with it what Koutouzis calls ``the militarization''
of the Kosovar drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Narcotics trafficking has been a permanent part of the Kosovo
picture for a long time. The question is where the profits go,''
Koutouzis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Rugova held sway and the object was a peaceful
settlement, the drug proceeds of Kosovo clans were at least
invested in growth, in things like better housing and health care.
It was a form of social taxation in a sense, and the more illegal
the activities, the more that their `businessmen' were expected to
pay.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the outbreak of war, Koutouzis adds, ``the investment
is only in destruction _ and the KLA's first effort was to destroy
the influence of Rugova, and no one in the West did much to help
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, NATO military officers and diplomats have always
been troubled by the murky origins and financing of the KLA, which
materialized for the first time in Kosovo on Nov. 28, 1997,
outfitted in expensive Swiss-manufactured uniforms and equipped
with the purloined Albanian Kalashnikovs.
</P>
<P>
   The mistrust is reciprocated. According to Veton Surroi, the
widely respected editor of Kosovo's Albanian-language daily
newspaper Koha Ditore, U.S. negotiator Richard Holbrooke had a
Kalashnikov held to his head when he arrived for a meeting with KLA
officers during one of his shuttle missions to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as February 25, U.S. Ambassador Chris Hill, another
of the negotiators, said, ``The KLA must understand that its
members have a future as members of political parties or local
police forces, but not in the continuation of armed struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   The eruption of war changed almost everything. Since the bombing
campaign opened, NATO has had little alternative but to rely on the
KLA for intelligence. Its guerrilla units inside Kosovo are the
only eyewitness sources of information on Serb troop movements.
</P>
<P>
   Solid intelligence about the KLA itself is nearly impossible to
nail down. NATO estimates put its forces at 15,000. Avdija Ramadom,
the organization's official spokesman, claims that the KLA has more
than 50,000 men.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to alleged drug receipts, the group is said to be
funded by a war tax of 3 percent imposed by the People's Movement
of Kosovo on the earnings of 500,000 ethnic Albanian emigrants in
Western Europe, a population that is soaring with the immense
exodus of refugees. Half of the prewar immigrants have settled in
Germany, according to the International Migration Organization, and
a third in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   A single fund-raising evening in Switzerland earlier this year
is believed to have raised $7 million from ethnic Albanian
immigrants, much of it earmarked for the KLA struggle against
Serbia.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Making a mess of poke salad
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ A fellow I know had brought me a mess of poke
salad. Maybe you're familiar with poke salad. Maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   If not, let me quote Tony Joe White, an authority on the
subject. He had the 1960s hit song ``Poke Salad Annie,'' which
begins with this intro:
</P>
<P>
   ``If some of y'all never been down south too much, I'm gonna
tell you a little about this so that you'll understand what I'm
talkin' about ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Down there we have a plant that grows out in the woods, and in
the field ... looks somethin' like a turnip green, and everybody
calls it poke salad ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Used to know a girl lived down there and she'd go out in the
evenings and pick her a mess of it, carry it home and cook it for
supper, cause that's about all they had to eat, but they did all
right.''
</P>
<P>
   The refrain is the part I like best:
</P>
<P>
   Poke Salad Annie,
</P>
<P>
   The gators got your granny,
</P>
<P>
   Everybody said it was a shame,
</P>
<P>
   Cause her Mama was workin on the chain gang,
</P>
<P>
   A wretched, spiteful, straight-razor totin' woman,
</P>
<P>
   Lord have mercy, pick me a mess of it.
</P>
<P>
   The thing about poke salad, lest we forget, is that it's
poisonous, right down to the roots. You want to pick the leaves
early in the spring when they're young and tender, then be sure to
parboil them good and proper.
</P>
<P>
   Bring them to a roiling /
</P>
<P>
   When I happened to come across it, the stuff looked still fresh
enough. So it was I decided to cook a pot full.
</P>
<P>
   There I was, picking away at the stems and washing the leaves,
when, hard to believe, two ugly spiders bigger than a quarter came
crawling out from under a sprig of poke salad, each alive and
kicking on all eight legs despite their stint of forced
hibernation.
</P>
<P>
   But it takes more than a couple of spiders to deter me from
dinner. I loosed them outside _ after what they'd been through,
they deserved to go free _ and then finished washing the poke salad
and put it in a pot to boil.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until the second egg pouch surfaced, bright white as a
new golf ball and almost as big as a bird's egg, that I decided to
take the whole mess out back and dump it.
</P>
<P>
   All together now ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody said it was a shame.''
</P>
<P>
   P.S. I can tell you probably why she carried a straight razor.
It was to fight off spiders while she was cleaning the poke salad
... wretched, spiteful spiders, especially after two weeks in the
refrigerator.
</P>

   1. SLIM CHANCE : CALISTA FLOCKHART SEES OPPORTUNITIES
</P>
<P>
   ON THE BIG SCREEN The star of the popular TV series ``Ally
McBeal'' has paid a price for her sudden fame that includes
speculation that she suffers from an eating disorder and a recent,
widely publicized rumour that she was having an affair with
``Ally'' creator David E. Kelley, who is married to Michelle
Pfeiffer, Flockhart's co-star in her next film. Fans may be
astounded to see ``Ally'' spout Shakespeare as the hopelessly
love-struck Helena in ``William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's
Dream'' but Flockhart was actually a stage veteran long before she
hit the small screen. ``What's so amazing,'' she says, is that
Shakespeare wrote the play centuries ago and yet the Helena he
created is not unlike Ally in 1999. They are both young women who
are ambitious, driven and passionate ...'' By Jeanne Wolf and Shep
Morgan. 1,300 words + photo. (N/A England.) 2. HOLLYWOOD GOOD GUY
Australian actor Guy Pearce admits he's a sensitive man. So when he
agreed to star in the grisly cannibalism movie ``Ravenous,'' the
decision was largely based on the reputation of its director,
Milcho Manchevski. And then two weeks into filming, 20th Century
Fox abruptly fired Manchevski. ``They obviously wanted to make a
movie that was funny and fun. Milcho didn't.'' So Pearce rebelled,
as did his co-star Robert Carlyle (of ``Trainspotting'' and ``The
Full Monty.'') By Louise Farr. From W magazine. 1,000 words +
photos. 3. MERLE HAGGARD STILL CALLS THE TUNE When Merle Haggard
released ``Okie from Muskogee'' 30 years ago, the song made him a
right-wing hero. Issued at the height of the Vietnam War protests,
it won him praise from conservatives for the line ``We don't smoke
marijuana in Muskogee/We don't take our trips on LSD.'' Haggard
always said the fuss was overplayed, claiming he intended the song
as a kind of joke. And today this country legend and rugged
individualist says that conservatives - especially the
anti-marijuana forces - have gone too far. By Steve Morse. From The
Boston Globe. 1,200 words + photo. 4. BOSNIAN-BORN DIRECTOR'S
APOLITICAL COMEDY DERAILED BY WAR It seems like dij` vu all over
again for Emir Kusturica. October Films has announced it is pushing
back the U.S. release of the Bosnian-born director's latest comedy
``Black Cat, White Cat'' from May until the autumn because of the
conflict in Kosovo. After the release of Kusturica's last film,
``Underground,'' in 1994, the French press declared that the
director's three-hour-long satirical comment on 50 years of war and
upheaval in the Balkans was pro-Serbian. Kusturica was
understandably furious and shortly after winning the Palme d'Or for
best film at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival, he announced he was
quitting the movie business. By Andrea R. Vaucher. From The
Hollywood Reporter. 1,000 words + photo. 5. NEW 'SEASONS' DAWN IN
VIETNAM Vietnamese-American director Tony Bui's first feature film,
``Three Seasons'' won both the Grand Jury Prize and the Audience
Award at this year's Sundance Film Festival. It is a moving,
remarkably mature depiction of life in modern Saigon. Bui, 26,
portrays a city scarred by decades of war, but trying to look to
the future. Harvey Keitel, the only non-Vietnamese actor in the
film, plays an American soldier who returns to Saigon after more
than 20 years to find the half-Vietnamese daughter he left behind.
By Joshua Mooney. BPI. 1,000 words + photo. 6. PUTTING THE FORCE IN
'THE PHANTOM MENACE' ... FOR LESS Filmed on three continents and
loaded with special effects, sceptics contend that the budget of
``only'' $115 million for the new Star Wars film ``Phantom Menace''
defies conventional logic. But there was nothing conventional about
the way it was made, says its producer Rick McCallum, who has
worked in the trenches with George Lucas to engineer a new type of
filmmaking. By Paula Parisi. From The Hollywood Reporter. 3,000
words + photo.

REGINA CARTER'S HIP 'HEART' STRINGS If music were a self-ordained
life force that could change form and chemistry at whim, crackling
like lightning then sobbing like a child, it might evince the same
metaphysical vigour as the supple jazz violin of Regina Carter. By
Timothy White. From Billboard. 1,200 words + photo.

AIDAN QUINN'S FAMILY AFFAIR Aidan Quinn's new movie ``This Is My
Father'' is based on a story that his mother used to tell her young
sons around the fire on cold winter nights, a story about two
lovers separated by class and religion in 1930s Ireland. It is a
true story. ``My grandfather actually carried the coffin of the
young suitor in the movie,'' says Quinn, ``so he was known to our
family. And, like any good Irish story, it got passed down until it
became lore.'' By Cindy Pearlman. 1,300 words + photo.

 &HT;    SCIENCE/HEALTH: Test vaccines for cancer to begin
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Franciscan Medical Center will develop and test
the first cancer vaccine of its kind on up to 40 local patients in
the next several months.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Finley and his staff will combine immune-system cells
from a patient's blood with irradiated and coated cells from the
patient's tumor to produce the two-part vaccine in a new lab at
Franciscan.
</P>
<P>
   Participants must have cancers for which there is no effective
conventional treatment, such as chemotherapy, and usually must
enroll before surgery to remove the tumor. Melanoma, the deadliest
skin cancer, has been the most susceptible to cancer vaccines, but
the trial will include a variety of other cancers.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer vaccines enhance the immune system not to prevent a
disease, as do most vaccines, but to attack a tumor that already
exists. While the immune system is designed to destroy any cells
that don't belong in the body, it does not recognize cancer cells
as interlopers, which enables tumors to grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because each patient's malignancy is genetically unique, it is
our hope that this cancer vaccine will teach the body's immune
system to attack the cancer cells,'' Finley said.
</P>
<P>
   Each part of his vaccine has been used with some success
independently. Finley and other scientists suspect the combination
will be more effective.
</P>
<P>
   Melanoma and colon cancer cells have been destroyed by using
vaccines with inactive cells from the same tumor, coated with a
substance the immune system can recognize, called a hapten. That
process helps the immune system identify the tumor as foreign to
the body.
</P>
<P>
   Dendritic white blood cells, which Finley called the body's best
cells for activating the immune system, have been used in treating
kidney and prostate cancer cells, as well as melanoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``By pre-exposing those cells to the tumor cells, the hope is it
will develop a more robust reaction to the cancer,'' said Dr.
Stuart Merl, Franciscan's medical director for oncology.
</P>
<P>
   It is rare for community hospitals to conduct Phase I cancer
trials, designed to establish the safety and effectiveness of a
treatment before it is compared with existing therapies. But Finley
began working on cancer vaccines in 1995 with scientists at Hipple
Cancer Research Center and conducted a small trial of five terminal
melanoma patients, two of whom survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went right back to work at my own real estate business and I
play golf twice a week,'' said Wally Sweetwater, now 73, who
completed the vaccine protocol in November 1995. ``We carry our own
bags and walk 18 holes at Miami Valley. I would not be here today
without Dr. Finley.''
</P>
<P>
   CANCER VACCINE TRIALS
</P>
<P>
   What: Clinical trial of two-part cancer vaccine using cells from
the patient's own tumor and blood.
</P>
<P>
   Who: Cancer patients with advanced breast, colo-rectal, gastric,
hepato cellular, nero-endocrine, non-small-cell lung, ovarian,
pancreatic, head and neck carcinomas as well as melanoma and
sarcoma skin cancers, may be eligible to be treated on this
protocol. Participants must have cancers that have not responded to
conventional treatment, such as radiation or chemotherapy, or
cancers for which no standard treatment exists beyond surgery.
</P>
<P>
   How: To be screened for possible enrollment in the research
protocol, patients must be referred by their physicians to Nancy
Hines, Dr. Robert Finley's registered nurse, (937) 228-5130.
</P>
<P>
   When: Enrollment must precede surgery to remove the cancer in
most cases.
</P>
<P>
   Cost: Free to participants. The Surgical Oncology Fund,
available through the Franciscan Foundation at the medical center,
has been established to cover costs of the research project,
including charges for treatments not covered by insurance because
they are experimental.

 &HT;    Commandments a bit too rigid to become law
 &HT;    By Frank Cerabino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ I'm not surprised that the Ten
Commandments died in the Florida Legislature last week.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Bill 52, which would have permitted the posting of The
Ten Commandments in public schools, courtrooms and government
buildings, didn't have a chance.
</P>
<P>
   That's because it wasn't handled right.
</P>
<P>
   Good legislation must be flexible to manipulation by the
competing lobbies. There's got to be a little something in it for
everybody. But there was nothing in the Ten Commandments the way it
was presented. Just a lot of don't do this, don't do that.
</P>
<P>
   Florida legislators needed more of a reason to embrace the Ten
Commandments. They needed some Ten Commandments pork.
</P>
<P>
   I've begun compiling a workable Ten Commandments for the state
to adopt in future legislative sessions. Sure, it's not perfect.
But no viable piece of legislation shaped by amendments ever is.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, the name needs to be changed.
</P>
<P>
   The word ``commandments'' is a red flag to the American Civil
Liberties Union. It just an invitation to a lawsuit. The ACLU is
currently talking trash to Palm Beach County's government over a
move to make strippers carry ID cards (a visually challenging
concept.)
</P>
<P>
   Why give the ACLU something else to gripe about?
</P>
<P>
   So before we even get started, let's just deal with the name.
Delete word ``Commandments.'' Replace with ``Voluntary
Suggestions.''
</P>
<P>
   The First Voluntary Suggestion: I am the Lord thy God, Thou
shalt have no other gods before me.
</P>
<P>
   Way too churchy. The atheists will never buy it. Suggested
amendment: Delete the word, ``God.'' Insert the word, ``Disney.''
</P>
<P>
   The Second Voluntary Suggestion: Thou shalt not make unto thee
any graven image, or any likeness of any thing. . .
</P>
<P>
   OK, we can throw a bone to the Religious Right on this one. And
to avoid confusion, we'll tack on, ``This should not be construed
to prohibit the state from marketing a `Choose God' vanity license
plate at a future date.''
</P>
<P>
   The Third Voluntary Suggestion: Thou shalt not take the name of
the Lord thy God in vain.
</P>
<P>
   Amended: ``. . . without the express prior written consent of
Major League Baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fourth Voluntary Suggestion: Remember the sabbath day, to
keep it holy. . .
</P>
<P>
   Gambling industry amendment: ``. . . and remember, kids get into
the greyhound track for only 50 cents on Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fifth Voluntary Suggestion: Honor thy mother and father.
</P>
<P>
   AARP amendment: ``. . . with senior citizen discounts for all
shopping mall purchases.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sixth Voluntary Suggestion: Thou shalt not kill.
</P>
<P>
   NRA amendment: Delete the word ``not.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seventh Voluntary Suggestion: Thou shalt not commit
adultery.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton amendment: Replace the word, ``commit'' with the word,
``prosecute.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eighth Voluntary Suggestion: Thou shalt not steal.
</P>
<P>
   Criminal defense lawyer amendment: ``. . . but if thou do, thou
shalt hire a lawyer and avoid making incriminating statements after
getting arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ninth Voluntary Suggestion: Thou shalt not lie.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism amendment: ``. . . but thou may make exaggerated claims
if it helps fill hotel rooms during the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tenth Voluntary Suggestion: Thou shalt not covet thy
neighbor's wife.
</P>
<P>
   Nudist amendment: Replace the word ``covet'' with the word,
``cover.''

 &HT;    Pity the poor politician
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ You've got to feel sorry for a candidate who
finishes behind a homeless person with a beeper. How do you explain
that on your resume?
</P>
<P>
   My heart goes out to Ray Vrudhula, a retired IBM engineer who
faces the ignominy of coming in dead last among all 17 candidates
in Saturday's three Austin City Council races.
</P>
<P>
   If this had been a NASCAR race, Vrudhula, who owns a small
software company called TekUSA, would have been lapped and run
over. Vrudhula even finished behind Jennifer Gale, a pager-packing
transient of questionable gender who got 691 votes (2.1 percent of
the vote) in the City Council Place 4 race for Beverly Griffith's
seat.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Vrudhula staggered to the finish line like a
three-legged mule with a paltry 478 votes, or 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the votes I got were in my neighborhood,'' Vrudhula
said. Vrudhula needs to move to a bigger neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Vrudhula figures he finished behind Gale because it was ``just a
random happening.'' So was the Titanic running into that large
iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   Vrudhula figures he would have done better if he'd raised more
money. The quixotic Vrudhula began the race with the notion that it
was ``really obscene `` to raise buckets of money for a local
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, one of the things is I refused to raise money like the
other people,'' Vrudhula said. ``I just had one fundraiser, and a
few people came and gave me money.''
</P>
<P>
   If Vrudhula's intent was to avoid contributions, he did one
heckuva job. As of April 21, the latest figures available show he
had raised $2,276, or $82,743.29 less than Griffith. So naturally
Griffith won, because as we all know in politics, money talks and
you know what walks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, those same figures show Gale had raised just $69.75. And
it was probably raised a dime at a time on the corner.
</P>
<P>
   I think the reason Gale whupped Vrudhula like a rug on a
clothesline is that her message was sexier than Vrudhula's. ``One
of the things I wanted to bring out was to make Austin truly the
Software Capital of the World,'' Vrudhula said. His platform called
for training software engineers here instead of importing them.
</P>
<P>
   That message is dishwater compared to Gale's exciting call for
more Austin roads that lead ``right out into the country.''
</P>
<P>
   In a candidate forum published in this newspaper, Gale said she
would like to build the Austin ``avenues, roads, streets and
boulevards'' that allow folks to travel ``right out into the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, most roads around here already end up out in the country,
if you follow them long enough. But I find Gale's ``Suddenly
Manor'' campaign more interesting than Vrudhula's call for more
locally-trained modem monkeys.
</P>
<P>
   Vrudhula says he put out 75 yard signs . ``By the way, a lot of
those signs were stolen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know why. They weren't particularly creative. They said,
simply, ``Vote for Ray Vrudhula Austin City Council Place 4.''
</P>
<P>
   Vrudhula would have turned more heads if his yard signs had
said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't Be a Fool-A
</P>
<P>
   Vote for Vrudhula''
</P>
<P>
   Or something like that.

 &HT;    Son learns lesson of friendship, letting go
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ When you call home and there are loud sobs on the
other end of the line, it's never a good sign.
</P>
<P>
   These were not the wails of a spouse at-the-end-of-his-rope, but
chest-heaving, end-of-the-world-sobs. The way the world can only
end when you're 7.
</P>
<P>
   And the world had indeed ended, for one very small member of our
household _ Stripe, a salamander my son adopted as a pet.
</P>
<P>
   Worse yet, Stripe had not died a natural death. Alec had covered
Stripe's bucket with a dingy-white shawl that protected him from
the light, but not, unfortunately, from 3-year-olds. While
``playing'' with Stripe, Veronica yanked the tail off her brother's
pet.
</P>
<P>
   The salamurderess refused to exhibit remorse or accept
responsibility for the crime. She was concerned about Stripe, it's
true, but purely from a territorial standpoint: ``What happened to
my salamander? Who hurt my salamander?''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Alec shouldered all the weight of first loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't believe it,'' he said. ``I saw him this morning,
and now he's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   This was not the only time in his life he would experience that
pain, that bereftness _ loss through death or desertion _ but this
was the first. I wish I could make it all better, kiss the hurt
away, but I couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   I should have seen this coming, from the minute Alec captured
Stripe in the back yard and started in on his ``Can I keep him can
I keep him Mom please?'' routine.
</P>
<P>
   For a week, all was bliss. Alec shared his knowledge of
salamander habits and lore. He cupped Stripe in his palm and
chatted with him. He checked in on Stripe last thing before he went
to bed at night and first thing when he woke in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   And then, tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Served me right for breaking my cardinal rule, forged in the
crucible of childhood grief: ``Never let them become emotionally
attached to anything smaller than a cat.''
</P>
<P>
   I too, after all, had lost a pet at the hands (or, more
specifically, the feet) of a sibling. I flashed back to 1968, to my
pet mouse, Frodo _ my best friend the desolate summer after sixth
grade, after my ``group'' disowned me on the not unreasonable
grounds that they didn't care for my personality.
</P>
<P>
   Since my company was in little demand elsewhere, Frodo and I
spent countless hours together. I even let him sun himself on the
front porch, hovering protectively over him.
</P>
<P>
   A horn honked, and Beth, my ever-popular sister, sailed out the
front door to meet her public. Her 3-inch clogs landed on the
unsuspecting, and now extremely moribund, Frodo.
</P>
<P>
   The summer was ruined, and things with Beth have, well, never
been quite the same.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, Alec was more understanding. He knew Veronica didn't
mean to kill Stripe. ``I just miss him,'' he said, voice quavering.
</P>
<P>
   Alec dug the earth around the bird bath, consecrating the burial
ground with violets and pinwheels. ``I hope Stripe likes his new
home,'' he said. I conducted the funeral service with unusual
eloquence, I thought, despite a few snafus:
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you, God, for letting Spike be a part of our lives . .
.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Stripe,'' Alec corrected. (First rule of effective eulogies, I
noted: Don't muff the name of the deceased.)
</P>
<P>
   ``And for letting Stripe be such a good friend to Alec, and Alec
such a good friend to Stripe.''
</P>
<P>
   Before going to bed that night, Alec gazed out the window at the
fresh grave, lit melodramatically by the security light.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope Stripe knows he was my best friend,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On his face was stamped the first sad lesson of friendship: To
make a friend, you must take the risk of losing him.

 &HT;    All signs point to a pointless endeavor
 &HT;    By D.L. Stewart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The hotel elevator doors closed and the bearded
guy who had just gotten on did a double-take when he saw the
teen-age girl standing in the corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martina, right? `` he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-age girl nodded.
</P>
<P>
   Instantly, the bearded guy shoved a pen and a copy of USA Today
at her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you sign this for me?''
</P>
<P>
   She took the pen and paper, scribbled her name and returned
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you make it to my daughter?'' the guy said, pushing the
back at her. ``Her name's Erica. With a 'c.' ``
</P>
<P>
   She took the paper again, scribbled ``to Erica,'' with a ``c,''
and returned it to him. By then, the elevator had reached the sixth
floor and Martina Hingis, the No. 1 female tennis player in the
world, made a quick and silent exit.
</P>
<P>
   The bearded guy got off a few floors later, clutching his USA
Today. I wondered exactly what he would do with it.
</P>
<P>
   Would he rush home and give it to Erica, with a ``c''? And would
she be so proud that her dad had met a celebrity that she would
sleep with the newspaper under her pillow for the rest of her life?
</P>
<P>
   Would they have the front page framed and hang it on their wall,
so their friends and neighbors could be impressed that the bearded
guy had ridden for six floors on the same elevator with a
professional tennis player?
</P>
<P>
   Or would this front page of USA Today wind up in a drawer
somewhere until eventually it turned yellow and brittle and then
found its way to a trash can with all the other stuff that had no
more value?
</P>
<P>
   I've never understood about autographs.
</P>
<P>
   I've never been able to figure out why a grown person would
spend an hour standing outside an arena dressing room in hopes that
some sneering, snorting guitar player would scrawl his name on
their scrap of paper?
</P>
<P>
   What compels someone to pay for the privilege of standing line
at an autograph session to get the illegible signature of a
24-year-old whose major contributions to the advancement of
civilization are the ability to throw a baseball and spit tobacco
juice?
</P>
<P>
   A celebrity's autograph could serve as a tangible reminder that
you had an encounter with someone famous, I suppose. Proof that you
once met a celebrity. But how much satisfaction can there be in an
autograph from a teen-age tennis player who has so little interest
in you that she can't be bothered saying ``hello,'' ``goodbye,''
``you're welcome'' or, even, ``excuse me, I'm getting off on this
floor.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm aware that some autographs probably have financial value. So
if you're on an elevator with, say, Queen Elizabeth or the pope, it
probably wouldn't be a bad idea to have them sign your USA Today.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I'd feel differently about autographs if I didn't have a
job that brought me in contact with celebrities on an occasional
basis. In more than 30 years I have encountered many famous
figures, some of whom are rarely seen in public, such as the
Montgomery County recorder.
</P>
<P>
   In all that time I have asked for only one autograph.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, I had an interview and breakfast with the most famous
person I ever met. Possibly the most famous person in the world.
When we were finished, he handed me an 8-by-10 photograph of
himself on which he had written:
</P>
<P>
   ``To D.L., Enjoy life, it's later than you think. Muhammad
Ali.''
</P>
<P>
   I have no idea what he did with mine.

 &HT;    Legendary Stiltsville facing its last sunset
 &HT;    By Jenny Staletovich
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BISCAYNE BAY, Fla. _ It's just after 6 p.m. on a Thursday and
while the rest of Miami descends into traffic hell on U.S. 1 or the
Palmetto Expressway, Chris Knight glides toward his little yellow
house in the bay.
</P>
<P>
   Above him, the sky glows orange, on the edge of twilight.
</P>
<P>
   Underneath, the sea goes from green to blue to where you can see
the stingrays flapping their wings and sharks grazing the sea
grass. Pelicans and cormorants skim the water. Suddenly, on the
horizon, a stand of old fishing cabins rises on stilts out of
Biscayne Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Knight points. ``Can you see them?'' he shouts as the Cape
Florida lighthouse comes into view.
</P>
<P>
   It's like he's commuting through time.
</P>
<P>
   With Miami slipping farther away, it's not hard to imagine when
sportsmen scouring the globe for game fish wound up here, sitting
around Crawfish Eddie's beer and bait shack, telling tales of
tarpon and bonefish. Or when a meal at the snazzy Quarterdeck Club
cost as much as a night at a first-rate Miami Beach hotel and
yachts, drunkenly navigated, littered the flats. Or when Plucky
Pierre opened the fab Bikini Club in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   But that was back when turtle kraals still had turtles and
riding Flipper cost only a couple bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Stiltsville is almost gone now. Of the original 30, only
Knight's Bay Chateau and six neighboring houses remain, desperately
clinging to their leases on the flats in Biscayne National Park's
180,000 acres. Come July, unless it can be convinced otherwise, the
National Park Service will evict the ``town'' when its 25-year bay
bottom leases expire. Private residences, even if they are largely
reserved for weekend use, have no place in a pristine, public
place, the Park Service says.
</P>
<P>
   Stiltsvillians are outraged. They believe they are a part of
history, a revered relic routinely featured in tours, books and
movies as an example of Miami's exotic past. They have sheltered,
at least for a night, every governor through Lawton Chiles. And
where else could a Carl Hiaasen protagonist slay a man with the
bill of a mounted marlin? When MGM needed a setting for Around the
World Under the Sea, Lloyd Bridges and Shirley Eaton came here. And
those Miami Vice boat chases? What would they be without
Stiltsville as a backdrop?
</P>
<P>
   But the community battle for recognition by the National
Register of Historic Places has so far failed. Without that
listing, the Park Service says it has no authority to renew leases.
</P>
<P>
   Park hasn't budged
</P>
<P>
   The park has remained adamant, despite letters of support from,
among others, South Florida's congressional delegation, the
University of Miami, the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce and the
Dade Heritage Trust, which continue to use the houses. Just last
month, the governing board of the Florida Bar and the chamber of
commerce hosted parties there.
</P>
<P>
   With bureaucratic measures exhausted _ the studies, the reviews,
the committee meetings _ the politicians are left to wrangle. On
Friday, U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen called a news conference at
one of the houses to unveil new supporters: the state's House of
Representatives and five cities in Metro-Dade County that passed
resolutions of support. Gov. Jeb Bush has also stepped in.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the Freedom Tower standing guard over Biscayne Bay to the
old coral homes nestled among the mangroves and palms in Coconut
Grove, the history of South Florida has been a struggle,'' Bush
wrote. ``For me, Stiltsville represents a harmony in that
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Clubs came first
</P>
<P>
   Long before Miami's landscape was a canyon of high-rises, before
a basketball arena _ no, make that two arenas _ crowded the
skyline, Stiltsville was born.
</P>
<P>
   Its heyday for bawdy socializing spanned nearly three decades,
from the first shack erected by Crawfish Eddie Walker_ widely
considered the founding father_ to the Bikini Club. The clubs came
first, built on barges wedged onto the flats, and drew the wealthy
and the wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time (outboard motor-maker) Ralph Evinrude would come
down, when he was between wives, he'd have big parties on his yacht
and the parties would kind of migrate between the yachts and the
Quarterdeck Club,'' said Capt. Bill Curtis, a legendary guide who
has been fishing the bay since 1949. ``I remember after some of
those parties on a weekend, boats would be strewn around the flats,
five to 10. Guys would get drunk and then they'd try to find their
way back through the channels. I used to have people charter me to
go out in their yachts just to have me navigate.''
</P>
<P>
   In the bar, an ode to the pirate life, trapdoors in the floor
let patrons fish with a hand line. A talking parakeet strutted
along the bar while a caged treasure chest held parrots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys were always trying to teach it dirty words,'' Curtis
said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950 a hurricane wiped out Crawfish Eddie's shack and nearly
claimed the Quarterdeck. A new owner took over, but the place
deteriorated. Instead of world-class food, hookers became the draw,
Curtis said. Authorities took a grim view and after a raid on a
Miami Junior Chamber of Commerce party, the club kept a
considerably lower profile. In 1951, fire destroyed it once and for
all. (Rumor had it being burned to avoid salvage fees but that was
never proven.) In the early 1960s, Plucky Pierre opened his Bikini
Club _ any girl in a bikini got a free drink, Curtis said. But
within a year the authorities shut it down.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, nearly 30 stilt cabins rose from the grassy flats.
The full-time Stiltsvillians brought a new sense of morality, ``a
family-type colony,'' said former Dade Circuit Judge Francis Knuck.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, the colony was nearly destroyed when Hurricane Betsy
blew through with 120 mph winds and an 11-foot storm surge. Sensing
a chance to seize control, Dade County ordered homeowners to follow
new building codes and prohibited reconstruction of houses more
than half destroyed. Then in 1980, Biscayne National Park expanded
to include Stiltsville and the beginning of the end began.
Hurricane Andrew added another nail when it destroyed all but the
last seven houses.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a 'planned assault'
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Park Service says it couldn't intervene if it wanted
to. For three reasons:
</P>
<P>
   When Congress adopted legislation expanding the park, it did so
to protect the Safety Valve, a marine feature at the mouth of the
bay, and failed to address the fate of Stiltsville. Second, park
rules allow and even encourage the leasing of buildings (it's
cheaper to lease property and have the lessee pay for maintenance).
But the buildings must be historic. Lastly, the park has a
management plan last updated in 1983 that includes Stiltsville's
removal. Changing the plan, a monumental task requiring public
hearings and federal review, would only be done for a major
alteration in the park, like the expansion, said Park
Superintendent Dick Frost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not some planned assault on Stiltsville by Biscayne
National Park,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But residents are skeptical. Frost, they said, promised not to
take a stand on the historic designation. Yet in January the
agency's Atlanta regional office wrote a letter opposing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea our regional office was going to write something
like that and they didn't let me know,'' Frost said Monday. ``I was
blindsided.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Frost had urged Stiltsville to pursue the historic
designation, but when staff at the National Register took a look at
the 33-page application, they rejected it. The problem? While the
community is older than 50 years, the surviving buildings are not.
</P>
<P>
   Long shot misses
</P>
<P>
   ``When I found that out, I said, oh, it's a long shot because
it's less than 50 years old,'' said Barbara Mattick, supervisor for
the state historic preservation office, which did recognize the
historic status of the community.
</P>
<P>
   There is a provision for preserving grounds if buildings no
longer exist, a kind of loophole Mattick hoped would fit
Stiltsville.
</P>
<P>
   But staff at the National Register didn't buy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The relationship of the seven remaining structures to each
other now appears to be so tenuous that the area no longer has the
cohesion necessary for a historic district,'' wrote Marilyn Harper,
the National Register's historian who rejected the application.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people really want to do is save these buildings and
getting them listed only goes a little way,'' she said recently.
``The decision really rests with the park. . . . It's too bad.
They're wonderful places and it must be magical to be out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Magical it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an only-in-Miami kind of place,'' said historian and
Miami-Dade Community College Professor Paul George. ``Age is not
the issue. It is a unique subculture of Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do we have to have historic designation for the National
Parks to allow Stiltsville to stay when we have such tremendous
community support behind us?'' asked Knight, who still remembers
coming here as a kid when neighbors hoisted flags to alert others
of their arrival. ``When I run into (Florida State football coach)
Bobby Bowden, he doesn't know my name. He yells Stiltsville!''
</P>
<P>
   Boaters regularly use the houses as channel markers, and fishing
guides hide from storms under their eaves. In March, two Miami men
got caught in a sudden squall. One died. The other survived by
swimming to one of the Stiltsville houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've poled in there and kissed the ground under the house,''
said Capt. Bob Branham, a guide who's fished the bay for three
decades. ``When you're out there in a boat and lightning's coming
down and you can't see your hand in front of your face because of
the rain, it's nice to have a roof over your head.''
</P>
<P>
   The fish like that roof, too, Branham said. Rather than remove
the houses _ several years ago the Park Service ripped up old
pilings and ruined much of the neighborhood for fish _ he suggests
rangers take them over and use one for a ranger station.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be fine with me if the good ol' boys kept them and
took care of them, but I do feel a twinge, that that's not fair.
Why should we go to the trouble to keep them for these rich
bastards?''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis argues fish were more plentiful before the houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The houses aren't completely to blame, but partially. The
extra traffic drives game fish like bonefish, permit and tarpon
right off the flats.''
</P>
<P>
   Weekend boaters jam park
</P>
<P>
   But Stiltsvillians consider their existence peaceful compared to
the boaters and gas-spewing Jet Skis that jam the park by the
hundreds on weekends. Once-grassy flats teeming with life have been
stripped by boats running aground. On Easter Sunday, dozens parked
at Sand's Cut to unload a horde that idly sunned themselves on lawn
chairs sunk in the water. A Miami-Dade County marine patrol boat, a
kind of water traffic cop, parked nearby to keep order.
</P>
<P>
   When Laura Hicks Roberts first came to Stiltsville with her
family, she was 5 and there were no Club Nautico boat rentals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very quiet by comparison,'' she said. ``There were no
Jet Skis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The world was a better place,'' her husband, Jeff, added.
``Now, at least once a month somebody in a rental boat pulls up and
asks for directions.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, a lawyer who took time off to raise three children, and
other residents have started a grass-roots campaign that has
collected more than 12,000 signatures to save the houses. She still
remembers the weekend her family bought their one-room, wood-frame
cabin furnished with a couple of futons and nothing worth stealing.
(Prices vary, but most cost about $25,000, Jeff Roberts said.)
</P>
<P>
   'An impressive date'
</P>
<P>
   ``One time we noticed a for-sale sign and basically by the end
of the day, my parents owned it.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the community has a kind of Rotary feel to it.
</P>
<P>
   Knight has ventured out on this perfect evening with a woman he
met through friends, for his second date. ``It's an impressive
date,'' Ruby Pezzi concedes. It seems like all of Miami is on the
water. As he pulls up to the Baldwin, Sessions and Shaw house to
check out a party _ the chamber has hired water taxis and invited
out executives new to town to get a taste of Miami _ the grandson
of Commodore Ralph Munroe, one of the founders of Coconut Grove,
waves from the deck. Across the channel, the governing board of the
Florida Bar is meeting. The president leans against a flag pole
while the president-elect screams, ``Chris!''
</P>
<P>
   With the sun sinking, Knight races to his own house to beat the
light. After he and his friends unpack their pte, wine and chicken
and rice dinners, Knight leans back in a deck chair, looking up at
stars invisible from the neon-lighted shore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still waiting,'' he says, ``for the first good argument on
why they need to go.''

 &HT;    A quirky assemblage of historical items soon will be no more
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In February, the Atlanta Preservation Center moved
into the Rufus M. Rose house, one of the last Victorian residences
on Peachtree Street. Soon afterward, staffers were startled to hear
a woman's scream coming from the second floor. The landlord, Mary
Gene Elliott, was up there. Had she surprised an intruder? Had she
seen a ghost? No, she was just sorting through her late husband's
things and had come across a human skull.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Creek Indian,'' she says. ``I'd forgotten we had that.''
</P>
<P>
   For half a century, the red brick mansion across from Crawford
Long Hospital in Midtown Atlanta has housed a collection of
historical oddments that seems equally inspired by the Smithsonian
and Ripley's Believe It or Not. Strange and singular things wait
behind the locked door at the top of the stairs: Hitler's cigar
box, Davy Crockett's rifle, Margaret Mitchell's wing chair,
Napoleon's candlesticks, part of the rope used to hang the Japanese
warlord Tojo, the urine jar Franklin D. Roosevelt kept beside his
bed at Warm Springs, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the most unusual museum in Atlanta will get its
final curtain call as Mrs. Elliott and the Preservation Center open
the collection for what they say will be its last public viewing.
Jim Elliott, the antiques dealer who ran the Atlanta Museum, died
last September, and his son and widow are liquidating the estate.
She hopes the Preservation Center will buy the house. As for the
collection, she wants to sell it as soon as possible, perhaps to an
out-of-state dealer.
</P>
<P>
   On a damp, gloomy afternoon last week, Mrs. Elliott consented to
give a preview tour of the museum, which has been closed for almost
six years. Wearing an Olympic windbreaker, her gray hair pulled
back, the 65-year-old Atlanta native led the way up a carved wooden
staircase and past a cracked stained glass window and unlocked the
folding metal door to the second floor.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, a long hallway lined with Civil War rifles opened onto
four dimly lit rooms filled with thousands of artifacts as tightly
arrayed as tools in an old-fashioned hardware store. The musty
randomness of it all confuses the senses. She pointed out one of
Eli Whitney's cotton gins, a shell from the siege of Atlanta, a
walking cane used by Lafayette, a chair said to have belonged to
Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie. The buses rumbling past the bay
windows seemed miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd show you the Conestoga wagon in the attic,'' she said,
``but it's a dark day and there aren't any lights up there.''
</P>
<P>
   The man who collected these curiosities was her husband's
father, J.H. Elliott Sr., a garrulous little fellow who founded one
of the South's most prominent appraisal houses. Not that he set out
to do that. Elliott was one of Atlanta's pioneer aviators and is
credited with laying out the first runway on what became Hartsfield
International Airport. He got into antiques after a nasty plane
crash, which he always managed to bring up when museum visitors
glimpsed one of his prize possessions _ a Japanese Zero airplane _
grounded in the back yard.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott started the museum in 1938 at his first shop downtown.
He moved uptown in 1945 when he purchased the Rose house, a grand
old place with a colorful history worthy of his treasures.
</P>
<P>
   Rufus M. Rose was a distiller who advertised ``the best and
purest medicinal whiskies obtainable.'' In 1900, he commissioned a
5,200-square-foot townhouse to be built in the Queen Anne style on
Peachtree, down the street from where the Governor's Mansion was.
When Georgia voted to go dry in 1908, Rose moved his distillery to
Tennessee, but his family remained in the residence until the
1920s. It later became a rooming house, a welfare office and (rumor
has it) a bootlegger's den.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott and his son set up shop there and added to the
collection during trips to auctions throughout the United States
and Europe. They acquired new keepsakes as they appraised the
estates of the famous, from Martha Berry and Margaret Mitchell to
Bobby Jones and FDR (they handled the contents of the Little White
House).
</P>
<P>
   The museum attracted a steady business until attendance began to
dwindle during the '80s. In recent years, the doors usually stayed
closed as Elliott Jr. grew disabled with diabetes. Developers
approached him all the time, wanting to buy the house and demolish
it for new construction. But Jim and Mary Gene Elliott were
dedicated preservationists _ they had met at a preservation meeting
in the early '70s _ and were determined to see the house saved.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, after her husband died, Mrs. Elliott got a call from
Derek Aynsley, the new director of the Atlanta Preservation Center,
a nonprofit organization best known for its walking tours of
historic neighborhoods. Unbeknownst to her, he had talked to her
husband about the possibility of the center moving into the Rose
house. She thought it was a fine idea and offered Aynsley a
three-year lease on the main floor, with the hope that the center
could eventually raise enough money to buy the house from the
estate.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be easy. Aynsley estimates that it will take at least
$1.5 million to purchase the property, renovate it and fund an
endowment for its upkeep. That would be five times his annual
budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being in this house is not central to our core mission of
education and advocacy,'' he says, sitting before a tiled fireplace
in his new office, the former dining room. But he clearly wants to
stay here. ``There's no more appropriate structure in town for us
to get our sticky fingers on.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Mrs. Elliott has put out the word on the
antiques grapevine that she wants to sell the collection soon and
intact. (Not including the Indian skull, of course; she says she
has contacted a Creek official about giving it a proper burial.)
Her best prospects, she says, are a dealer in Tennessee and a
museum in Illinois. She does not expect the collection to end up
with an Atlanta institution.
</P>
<P>
   The Margaret Mitchell House and Museum was interested in some of
the furniture and personal effects that had been part of the
author's estate. Mrs. Elliott wouldn't sell them separately.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious local suitor has been the Atlanta History
Center. Director Rick Beard says that a donor who was willing to
underwrite the acquisition is becoming impatient as negotiations
drag on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a loss for some of those things to leave
Atlanta,'' Beard says. ``But if she can get a million dollars for
them from someone in Illinois, more power to her. She won't be
getting that from us.''
</P>
<P>
   Price isn't the only sticking point. The History Center has
asked to see documentation proving the authenticity of some
artifacts _ a routine procedure in any acquisition. ``We're
skeptical,'' Beard says.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't the first time anyone has wondered whether some of the
stuff in the Atlanta Museum is for real.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Elliott says that her husband and father-in-law got
affadavits and documentation to back up everything. She has stacks
of paper on a Ping-Pong table in her home to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, if she's pressed on the question, she admits to some doubts
herself. ``I'm sure some of it is not what they said it is,'' she
says. ``Then again, when you hear the stories of how they got
things, there's always something logical behind it.''
</P>
<P>
   Take the Tojo rope. This is the way she heard it:
</P>
<P>
   It seems that old man Elliott was friends with a general from
Georgia who witnessed the hanging of the Japanese premier for war
crimes. He was ordered to bring the rope back to Washington and
stopped in Atlanta on the way. Elliott got wind of it and leapt
into action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't you cut me off a piece of that rope?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The general wouldn't do it. ``I've got to take it to the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott persisted. ``Does he know how long the rope is?''
</P>
<P>
   Funny thing about that rope: When you see the six-inch piece in
the display case, it doesn't look nearly thick enough to have done
the grim job it is supposed to have done. There's a story behind
that, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, it came unraveled,'' Mrs. Elliott explains. ``I've got the
rest of it at home.''

<P>
   Q: I'd like to contact Rev. Jesse Jackson to thank him for
getting our captured servicemen released. What is the address?
</P>
<P>
   A: Write him in care of Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, 930 E. 50th St.,
Chicago, IL 60615-2702. Or, visit the Rainbow/Push Coalition site
on the Internet _ www.rainbowpush.org _ and call up the
preaddressed message format where you see ``Click Here to
congratulate Rev. Jackson and the delegation of U.S. religious
leaders for the release of the three American soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I want to enter the lottery for tickets for next year's
Masters practice rounds. You've printed this information in years
past, but I didn't save it. Can you tell us again?
</P>
<P>
   A: To enter the random drawing, send a letter with your name,
address, daytime telephone number and Social Security number no
later than July 15 to: Masters Tournament, Practice Rounds, Augusta
National Golf Club, P.O. Box 2047, Augusta, GA 30903.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported recently that the nation's worst school
massacre occurred decades ago, and it was instigated by an adult.
What happened?
</P>
<P>
   A: That item probably was referring to an explosion May 18,
1927, in Bath, Mich., near Lansing. As recounted last month by the
AP, school board member Andrew Kehoe, angry that the building of
Bath Consolidated School had caused an increase in his taxes, and
fearing foreclosure on his farm, spent months stringing wires and
hiding dynamite in the school's basement. School administrators
thought he was working to save the expense of hiring an
electrician.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the tragedy, Kehoe drove away from the school two
minutes before the explosives detonated. Then he drove back and
detonated dynamite in his truck, killing himself and the school
superintendent. In the end, 38 children and five adults were dead.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We enjoy the comic strip ``Mutts,'' which seems so true to
life for those of us who love animals. Can you give me any
information about the creator? The name is so small on the strip I
can't even read it.
</P>
<P>
   A: Patrick McDonnell created ``Mutts'' in 1994. What makes it
different from comic strips by other artists, he says, is that he
doesn't make his creatures humans in animal form. ``I'm really
trying to keep them like pets,'' McDonnell says. ``I haven't gotten
them up on two legs, walking around doing human things. I try my
hardest to keep them doing things animals would do.'' The strip's
lead characters are Earl the dog, and Mooch the cat.
</P>
<P>
   McDonnell, 43, graduated from the School of Visual Arts in New
York. While still in school he sold a few illustrations to the
Village Voice, but his first real job after graduation was
illustrating Russell Baker's column for The New York Times, a job
he held for 10 years. McDonnell also has done TV work, including a
90-minute animated movie, and illustrations and comic strips for
such magazines as Parade, Sports Illustrated and Parents.
</P>
<P>
   McDonnell lives in New Jersey with his wife, Karen; his dog,
Earl; and a cat, Meemow. ``Mutts'' is distrbuted to more than 400
newspapers by King Features Syndicate.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently answered a question in Stars and Stripes about
the ``real'' name of Britain's royal family. Can you provide the
same information on the family name of the Japanese emperor?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's no surname, in the style of the West, that follows
from one generation to the next, says the Consulate General of
Japan. The present emperor, and the scion of the oldest imperial
family in the world, is Akihito, whose original name was Tsugu
Akihito. Akihito was the fifth child and eldest son of Emperor
Hirohito and Empress Nagako. Hirohito, whose original name was
Michinomiya Hirohito, was the oldest of the four sons of Crown
Prince Yoshihito, later the Emperor Taisho, and of Crown Princess
Sadako.
</P>
<P>
   According to tradition, Akihito, who has been emperor since
1989, is the 125th direct descendant of Jimmu, Japan's legendary
first emperor.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Other than the color of the shells, is there any nutritional
difference between brown and white eggs?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Egg color often assumes economic importance if there are
local prejudices in favor of certain shell tints, but they have the
same food value. And while some people claim that one or the other
is tastier and/or healthier, there's no firm evidence of that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the worst pollen for people who suffer pollen
allergies? I've been told it's from grass, but I'd like an official
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   A: There's no single worst offender for everyone, said Dr.
Sandra Roberson of the Atlanta Allergy &AMP; Asthma Clinic, because it
depends on each individual person's allergies. If you're not
allergic to grasses, and the grasses are out, you won't have a
problem, she explained. However, if you're allergic to trees, you
might.
</P>
<P>
   The time of year also is a factor. Trees tend to pollinate
first, starting in early March and going through the spring.
Grasses come on their heels, going into the summer months. Then
weeds, with ragweed being the prototype, create pollen in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the ``minor players,'' which also can cause
problems for those who are allergic to them, Robertson added. But
again, they won't affect everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the schedule for releasing quarters commemorating the
50 states and their admission to the United States?
</P>
<P>
   A: Coins being issued this year commemorate Delaware,
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Georgia and Connecticut. The remainder:
</P>
<P>
   2000: Massachusetts, Maryland, South Carolina, New Hampshire,
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   2001: New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Vermont, Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   2002: Tennessee, Ohio, Louisiana, Indiana, Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   2003: Illinois, Alabama, Maine, Missouri, Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   2004: Michigan, Florida, Texas, Iowa, Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   2005: California, Minnesota, Oregon, Kansas, West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   2006: Nevada, Nebraska, Colorado, North Dakota, South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   2007: Montana, Washington, Idaho, Wyoming, Utah.
</P>
<P>
   2008: Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona, Alaska, Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some time ago, I read that the airlines send unclaimed
luggage and items people have left on planes to a place in Alabama
that sells them to the public. Do you have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: You may be referring to The Unclaimed Baggage Center in
Scottsboro, Ala., which calls itself ``the lost luggage capital of
the world.''

   Merchandise comes from baggage that has gone unclaimed by
airline passengers, lost articles left on planes at airports, and
unclaimed air cargo. The store says it buys items only after
airlines and airports go through an extensive search in an attempt
to rejoin luggage and items with their owners, a process that can
take up to 90 days. Ultimately, those items unable to be matched
then go through the airlines' claims settlement process, which can
take more than three additional months.
</P>
<P>
   After that, items land at Unclaimed Baggage Center, 509 W.
Willow St., Scottsboro. Information: 256-259-1525. The baggage
center says about 60 percent of the items in stock is clothing,
with the remainder likely to include sporting goods, computers,
camera equipment, jewelry and specialty items.
</P>
<P>
   Q: James Rubin, spokesman for the State Department, appears to
be quite young for such a position. What is his background?
</P>
<P>
   A: Rubin looks young because he is young. Born in New York in
1960, he received a B.A. in political science from Columbia
University in 1982, and a master in international affairs degree
from Columbia in 1984. Rubin once told the New York Times that he
was transformed when, during his Columbia years, Ronald Reagan was
elected president, and many people thought nuclear destruction
might follow. Rather than joining a protest group, Rubin devoted
himself to learning everything he could about nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   From 1985 to 1989, Rubin was research director for the nonprofit
Arms Control Association in Washington, serving as consultant to
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on nuclear arms control
issues. His other positions have included senior foreign policy
adviser to Sen. Joseph Biden Jr. (D-Del.); senior adviser and
spokesman for Madeleine Albright when she was U.S. ambassador to
the United Nations; director of foreign policy and spokesman for
the Clinton-Gore '96 campaign; and senior adviser to Albright after
she was named secretary of state. On Aug. 4, 1997, Albright swore
Rubin in as assistant secretary of state for public affairs, his
current position.

<P>
   Q: On a ``Jeopardy'' rerun, the question was,``What was the
second-largest country after Russia?'' To my surprise, it was
Canada. With the breakup of the former Soviet Union, is Russia
still No. 1?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Before its breakup in 1991, the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics, also called the Soviet Union, was the largest
country in the world. The constituent republic of the U.S.S.R. that
is now Russia, or the Russian Federation, is still the world's
largest country, and is almost twice as big as Canada. The
statistics: Russia, 6.6 million square miles; Canada, 3.85 million
square miles. The former U.S.S.R., for comparison: 8.65 million
square miles.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: The House recently voted 424-1 to award Rosa Parks the
Congressional Gold Medal. Who was the one person who voted against
the honor?
</P>
<P>
   A: Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas) was the sole dissenter. But his vote
wasn't a reflection on Parks or her role in the civil rights
movement by refusing to give up her seat on a segregated bus in
Alabama in 1955, said Paul spokesman Michael Sullivan. For years
Paul has voted against what he calls such ``immoral'' uses of
taxpayer money as spending $30,000 to provide gold medals to
people. ``We feel it's inappropriate for Congress to be so generous
with taxpayer's money at a time when the future of Social Security
is uneasy at best, the military can't seem to find the money to pay
its retirees, and we can't seem to afford a tax-cut for
middle-class Americans,'' Sullivan told Q&AMP;A.
</P>
<P>
   Paul would support the idea of gold medals from Congress to
worthy recipients like Parks, Sullivan added, if each member of
Congress were willing to contribute $100 of his or her own money to
fund it. But that idea has gone nowhere each time Paul has proposed
it over the years, Sullivan said, so the congressman continues his
opposition to such programs.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I was advised to start collecting and saving the new $20
bills, as if I could afford to, because they all have the wrong
date. The bills came out in 1999, but they're printed with 1996.
Was this a mistake that might make them valuable to collectors?
</P>
<P>
   A: The date isn't wrong. The newly designed $20 bills, while
they were issued starting Sept. 24, 1998, are part of the Treasury
Department's Series 1996 notes, which also include newly designed
$50 and $100 bills. Save them if you wish, but they aren't likely
ever to become highly prized collector's items.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've heard a number of stories about where Vice President Al
Gore received his education. Did he attend school in Tennessee or
elsewhere?
</P>
<P>
   A: Here's his background. Gore, who was born March 31, 1948,
grew up in Washington, where he attended the exclusive St. Albans
Episcopal School for Boys. After that he enrolled at Harvard
University, where he received a B.A. in government in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   After serving in the Army as a reporter with the 20th
Engineering Battalion, which was stationed outside Saigon, Gore
pursued a number of activities, including writing for the Nashville
Tennessean. While working the night shift at the newspaper in
1971-72, he studied philosophy and phenomenology at Vanderbilt
University's Graduate School of Religion. Although he didn't obtain
a degree there, Gore explained that he went to divinity school ``to
study the spiritual issues that were most important to me at the
time.'' In 1974 he enrolled in Vanderbilt's Law School, where he
remained for two years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976 he left law school to become a candidate for the House
seat being vacated by Democratic Rep. Joe Evins, who had decided
not to seek re-election. Gore won the Democratic primary and the
general election. You know the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the area in square miles of the province of Kosovo?
What was the population before the latest strife and evacuation of
ethnic Albanians living there started recently?
</P>
<P>
   A: Kosovo's area is 4,203 square miles, making it slightly
smaller than Connecticut. Its population (1991) was just under 2
million.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I enjoy Lisa Simeone, who now hosts ``Performance Today'' on
National Public Radio, but I wonder: Why is Martin Goldsmith no
longer on the show?
</P>
<P>
   A: Goldsmith, who joined ``Performance Today'' as music director
in 1987 and became its host two years later, began a leave of
absence March 22. NPR says he's writing a book about his parents'
``extraordinary lives in, and escape from, Nazi Germany.'' Simeone,
a regular guest host, will fill in until Goldsmith returns in July.
</P>
<P>
   The book, titled ``The Inextinguishable Symphony,'' will be
published next year by John Wiley and Sons. It will chronicle the
involvement of Goldsmith's parents, both classical musicians, in
the nearly forgotten Juedischer Kulturbund. The Kulturbund's
orchestras, opera companies, theater troupes and lecture series
were the only cultural outlets available to Jews under the Nazi
regime, NPR's Anya Grundmann explained, providing both important
channels for artistic expression for Jews and political cover for
the Reich.
</P>
<P>
   Goldsmith's parents met in the Kulturbund's orchestra in
Frankfurt in 1936, and later performed with the orchestra in
Berlin. They escaped together to the United States in 1941, just
months before the Nazis cut off Jewish emigration.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported recently that Congress had approved a $1.74
trillion budget. How does the Gramm-Rudman Act fit into that, if
all all?
</P>
<P>
   A: It doesn't. The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Balanced Budget and
Emergency Deficit Reduction Act of 1985 went to a quiet death in
1993. While it was simple in intent and content _ setting specific
budgetary targets that Congress would have to meet over the six
fiscal years after it was enacted _ it apparently worked too well
for its own good.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to trim federal spending _ or to increase taxes _ enough
to meet its mandate would have resulted in across-the-board cuts in
domestic and defense outlays. For example, an across-the-board cut
reduced the 1986 budget by $11.7 billion. In fiscal 1987, the
threat of Gramm-Rudman's meat-ax approach to spending trimmed
another $83 billion. So a projected deficit of $296 billion in
fiscal 1990 was $124 billion instead, thanks to Gramm-Rudman.
</P>
<P>
   Congress voted to extend Gramm-Rudman's budget-balancing target
to 1993. Then, under President Bush's ill-fated budget deal with
Congress in 1990 that promised $500 billion in deficit reduction,
Gramm-Rudman was suspended. While Congress promised to bring it
back, it simply died with President Clinton's new budget plan. The
bottom line was that when the law began to force meaningful cuts in
spending, Congress balked.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I had understood that France at one time had ceased its
membership in NATO, so I'm surprised to see it's so active in
NATO's Serbia decision-making now. Can you trace France's history
in the organization?
</P>
<P>
   A: France was one of 12 nations whose foreign ministers signed a
treaty April 4, 1949, in Washington creating the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization for collective defense. Then, on March 10,
1966, French President Charles DeGaulle announced France's
intention to withdraw from the NATO integrated military structure.
</P>
<P>
   But that isn't the same as ceasing membership in NATO, said
Blanca DePriest of the U.S. Information Agency. France retained its
membership, but wanted out of the military aspect of NATO. France
also asked that NATO move its headquarters from Paris to Brussels,
Belgium, because it didn't want the NATO military operations to be
on French soil.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, while France is involved in the NATO operations in
Yugoslavia, it isn't ``fully integrated'' into NATO, DePriest
added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The federal government must collect billions of dollars in
taxes from lottery winners nationwide. Where does this money go?
</P>
<P>
   A: The IRS doesn't differentiate between taxes paid on lottery
winnings and other income taxes paid. All such monies go from IRS
service centers into the Treasury Department's general fund by way
of the Federal Reserve Bank. The 1040 forms don't have a separate
category for listing lottery winnings; they're simply lumped into
the category ``other income.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: The U.S. Constitution requires a census to be taken every 10
years. Who is to be included? It is just U.S. citizens? Citizens
plus resident aliens? Or everybody who's here, legally or
otherwise?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Census Bureau says it includes all people who are
residents of the United States except those living on the grounds
of an embassy, ministry, legation, chancellery or consulate,
because they're considered to be living on foreign soil and
therefore not residents of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau also enumerates U.S. citizens overseas who are
working for the U.S. government, and their dependents living with
them. Private U.S. citizens living overseas who are not affiliated
with the U.S. government are not included in the census count.
Others not counted are citizens of foreign countries temporarily
living or traveling in the United States, because they have not
established a residence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't differentiate between citizens and noncitizens,''
said Census Bureau spokeswoman Bea Piddock. ``We never ask if they
are legal or illegal, so that is immaterial.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Could you give me some information about May Day? How did it
come to be a day of celebration? Also, is there any connection
between May Day and the mayday distress call?
</P>
<P>
   A: May Day (May 1) is celebrated as a spring festival in many
countries and is traced to festivals of ancient Egypt and India
marking the revival of life each year after winter. The English and
other peoples whom the Romans conquered developed their May Day
festivals from the Roman observance Floralia, in which the Romans
gathered flowers to honor Flora, the goddess of springtime.
Eventually Floralia was combined with a Celtic celebration,
Beltane, which was held on May 1.
</P>
<P>
   In medieval times May Day became a favorite holiday in many
English villages, and other European countries also observed it,
with some attaching religious importance.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1800s, Socialist and Communist countries began
honoring working people on the first day of May, with celebrations
of military might added later by the former Soviet Union and other
Eastern bloc countries.
</P>
<P>
   There's no connection with mayday, the international radio
communications distress signal, which is the anglicized spelling of
the French phrase(venez) m'aider, meaning ``(come) help me.''
</P>
<P>
   End.

AP, school board member Andrew Kehoe, angry that the building of
Bath Consolidated School had caused an increase in his taxes, and
fearing foreclosure on his farm, spent months stringing wires and
hiding dynamite in the school's basement. School administrators
thought he was working to save the expense of hiring an
electrician.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the tragedy, Kehoe drove away from the school two
minutes before the explosives detonated. Then he drove back and
detonated dynamite in his truck, killing himself and the school
superintendent. In the end, 38 children and five adults were dead.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We enjoy the comic strip ``Mutts,'' which seems so true to
life for those of us who love animals. Can you give me any
information about the creator? The name is so small on the strip I
can't even read it.
</P>
<P>
   A: Patrick McDonnell created ``Mutts'' in 1994. What makes it
different from comic strips by other artists, he says, is that he
doesn't make his creatures humans in animal form. ``I'm really
trying to keep them like pets,'' McDonnell says. ``I haven't gotten
them up on two legs, walking around doing human things. I try my
hardest to keep them doing things animals would do.'' The strip's
lead characters are Earl the dog, and Mooch the cat.
</P>
<P>
   McDonnell, 43, graduated from the School of Visual Arts in New
York. While still in school he sold a few illustrations to the
Village Voice, but his first real job after graduation was
illustrating Russell Baker's column for The New York Times, a job
he held for 10 years. McDonnell also has done TV work, including a
90-minute animated movie, and illustrations and comic strips for
such magazines as Parade, Sports Illustrated and Parents.
</P>
<P>
   McDonnell lives in New Jersey with his wife, Karen; his dog,
Earl; and a cat, Meemow. ``Mutts'' is distrbuted to more than 400
newspapers by King Features Syndicate.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently answered a question in Stars and Stripes about
the ``real'' name of Britain's royal family. Can you provide the
same information on the family name of the Japanese emperor?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's no surname, in the style of the West, that follows
from one generation to the next, says the Consulate General of
Japan. The present emperor, and the scion of the oldest imperial
family in the world, is Akihito, whose original name was Tsugu
Akihito. Akihito was the fifth child and eldest son of Emperor
Hirohito and Empress Nagako. Hirohito, whose original name was
Michinomiya Hirohito, was the oldest of the four sons of Crown
Prince Yoshihito, later the Emperor Taisho, and of Crown Princess
Sadako.
</P>
<P>
   According to tradition, Akihito, who has been emperor since
1989, is the 125th direct descendant of Jimmu, Japan's legendary
first emperor.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Other than the color of the shells, is there any nutritional
difference between brown and white eggs?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Egg color often assumes economic importance if there are
local prejudices in favor of certain shell tints, but they have the
same food value. And while some people claim that one or the other
is tastier and/or healthier, there's no firm evidence of that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the worst pollen for people who suffer pollen
allergies? I've been told it's from grass, but I'd like an official
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   A: There's no single worst offender for everyone, said Dr.
Sandra Roberson of the Atlanta Allergy &AMP; Asthma Clinic, because it
depends on each individual person's allergies. If you're not
allergic to grasses, and the grasses are out, you won't have a
problem, she explained. However, if you're allergic to trees, you
might.
</P>
<P>
   The time of year also is a factor. Trees tend to pollinate
first, starting in early March and going through the spring.
Grasses come on their heels, going into the summer months. Then
weeds, with ragweed being the prototype, create pollen in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the ``minor players,'' which also can cause
problems for those who are allergic to them, Robertson added. But
again, they won't affect everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the schedule for releasing quarters commemorating the
50 states and their admission to the United States?
</P>
<P>
   A: Coins being issued this year commemorate Delaware,
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Georgia and Connecticut. The remainder:
</P>
<P>
   2000: Massachusetts, Maryland, South Carolina, New Hampshire,
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   2001: New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Vermont, Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   2002: Tennessee, Ohio, Louisiana, Indiana, Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   2003: Illinois, Alabama, Maine, Missouri, Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   2004: Michigan, Florida, Texas, Iowa, Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   2005: California, Minnesota, Oregon, Kansas, West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   2006: Nevada, Nebraska, Colorado, North Dakota, South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   2007: Montana, Washington, Idaho, Wyoming, Utah.
</P>
<P>
   2008: Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona, Alaska, Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some time ago, I read that the airlines send unclaimed
luggage and items people have left on planes to a place in Alabama
that sells them to the public. Do you have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: You may be referring to The Unclaimed Baggage Center in
Scottsboro, Ala., which calls itself ``the lost luggage capital of
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Merchandise comes from baggage that has gone unclaimed by
airline passengers, lost articles left on planes at airports, and
unclaimed air cargo. The store says it buys items only after
airlines and airports go through an extensive search in an attempt
to rejoin luggage and items with their owners, a process that can
take up to 90 days. Ultimately, those items unable to be matched
then go through the airlines' claims settlement process, which can
take more than three additional months.
</P>
<P>
   After that, items land at Unclaimed Baggage Center, 509 W.
Willow St., Scottsboro. Information: 256-259-1525. The baggage
center says about 60 percent of the items in stock is clothing,
with the remainder likely to include sporting goods, computers,
camera equipment, jewelry and specialty items.
</P>
<P>
   Q: James Rubin, spokesman for the State Department, appears to
be quite young for such a position. What is his background?
</P>
<P>
   A: Rubin looks young because he is young. Born in New York in
1960, he received a B.A. in political science from Columbia
University in 1982, and a master in international affairs degree
from Columbia in 1984. Rubin once told the New York Times that he
was transformed when, during his Columbia years, Ronald Reagan was
elected president, and many people thought nuclear destruction
might follow. Rather than joining a protest group, Rubin devoted
himself to learning everything he could about nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   From 1985 to 1989, Rubin was research director for the nonprofit
Arms Control Association in Washington, serving as consultant to
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on nuclear arms control
issues. His other positions have included senior foreign policy
adviser to Sen. Joseph Biden Jr. (D-Del.); senior adviser and
spokesman for Madeleine Albright when she was U.S. ambassador to
the United Nations; director of foreign policy and spokesman for
the Clinton-Gore '96 campaign; and senior adviser to Albright after
she was named secretary of state. On Aug. 4, 1997, Albright swore
Rubin in as assistant secretary of state for public affairs, his
current position.
</P>
<P>
   Q: On a ``Jeopardy'' rerun, the question was,``What was the
second-largest country after Russia?'' To my surprise, it was
Canada. With the breakup of the former Soviet Union, is Russia
still No. 1?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Before its breakup in 1991, the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics, also called the Soviet Union, was the largest
country in the world. The constituent republic of the U.S.S.R. that
is now Russia, or the Russian Federation, is still the world's
largest country, and is almost twice as big as Canada. The
statistics: Russia, 6.6 million square miles; Canada, 3.85 million
square miles. The former U.S.S.R., for comparison: 8.65 million
square miles.
</P>
<P>
   End Take 1.

 &HT;    Piece by piece, Reynolds dinner theater goes up for auction
 &HT;    By Tim O'Meilia
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JUPITER, Fla. _ So this is what it's come to:
</P>
<P>
   Photo of Burt and then-Gov. Bob Graham. $5.
</P>
<P>
   Burt and a guy in an ascot. $5.
</P>
<P>
   Burt and the pope. $50.
</P>
<P>
   Burt and Loni. Both smiling. $10.
</P>
<P>
   Burt ``and an older gentleman,'' said auctioneer Jay Sugarman.
``That's Groucho Marx,'' offered D. Cooper Getschal. $20.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 people attended one last performance Tuesday at the
long-dead Burt Reynolds Dinner Theater as the new owners cleaned
out the closets and offices with an auction.
</P>
<P>
   On the block were 162 pencil sketches of the stars of each play
that decorated the lobby, dozens of signed and unsigned photos of
Reynolds and to Reynolds by show biz personalities, light bulbs,
kitchen equipment and play posters, among other artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   Where else could you find a belly full of Ned Beatty and a
chubby Charles Durning in the same photo? (It's a horizontal
picture).
</P>
<P>
   ``Doesn't that look like a mustache and beard on Loni?'' said
one browser of a photo of Loni Anderson, one of Reynolds' exes.
</P>
<P>
   The auction took 6 1/2 hours and earned ``a drawerful of money''
for the theater's new owners, Christ's Church of the Palm Beaches,
said Getschal, the church's music director. The ``tens of
thousands'' will be spent on the children's program for the
evangelical, nondenominational church, which plans to open in the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Dolan bought a dressing room door signed by the cast of
West Side Story.how much? Along with other trinkets, it will
decorate the Serendipity Theater she owns in Tequesta.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spirits are speaking to me in this building,'' she said.
But cash spoke louder. She was outbid for a framed poster of Crazy
for You.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Galvin of Palm Beach Gardens picked up a black-and-white
photo of Reynolds and some of the Rat Pack _ Frank Sinatra, Dean
Martin, Sammy Davis and Reynolds sidekick Dom DeLuise _ for a hotly
contested $2,250.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a fan of Burt's,'' Galvin said. ``And when I saw the
Rat Pack, I knew I had to have it. It's so unusual to find all
these signatures together. The Dean Martin line is a classic.''
</P>
<P>
   But too profane to be repeated in this newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to get rid of it,'' laughed the church's children's
program director, Chelly Templeton. ``We couldn't put it in the
church, not even in the coffeehouse.''
</P>
<P>
   What didn't sell _ including Burt's personal sink and toilet _
is available until the end of the week at the church/theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm king of the Longest Yard Sale,'' Getschal said.
</P>
<P>
   Caterer Enrico Vittori waited patiently through the memorabilia
sale to bid for champagne glasses, plate warmers and trays. ``Just
imagine,'' he laughed, holding up a plate, ``Burt Reynolds ate on
it.''

 &HT;    Painstaking hors d'oeuvres hardly qualify as a quick fix
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ It's almost too easy to take potshots at Martha
Stewart. The woman invites it.
</P>
<P>
   Just turn to the new Martha Stewart's Hors d'oeuvres Handbook
(Potter, $35).
</P>
<P>
   First, you have to get beyond the jacket, which has a rather
pitiful Stewart proffering a single hors d'oeuvre on a pink napkin.
She has the good grace to look chagrined by the lonely little
appetizer _ a far cry from the woman who once put real gold leaf on
a gingerbread house.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the book makes up for that inside with more than 220 pages
of detailed color pictures to tempt you to flip to a recipe.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Are you really ready to make grape cups, hollowing out each
little grape and then filling it with hand-molded rounds of goat
cheese? How about making potato wafers in a variety of shapes,
using a plastic template you have cut out with your trusty Exacto
knife? Tedium comes to a standstill in little appetizers with _
count them _ 10 layers of tiny thyme leaves, slices of fingerling
potatoes and goat cheese, assembled in a mini-muffin pan.
</P>
<P>
   If you had a team as big as Stewart has you might be able to
make the twice-fried plantain chips that are assembled into
miniature jerk chicken sandwiches, prettily tied with a blanched
chive.
</P>
<P>
   While the book has Stewart's name on it, it was produced by a
team. You didn't think she was still at home hollowing out cherry
tomatoes to serve a sip of soup, did you? Or spending her days
making miniature tortillas and green tea crepes by hand. Or, for
that matter, making her own potting soil? But call this team a
Stewart clone, for they have certainly adopted her spirit. She has
left her mark as well as her name.
</P>
<P>
   All that said, I decided to inspect the book with an open mind,
with a view to what I think is the biggest challenge: finding a
lineup of appetizers that a host without hired help can make ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The book is helpful in that respect. Introductions to recipes
indicate which can be made ahead. That does not necessarily make
them simple. Witness a jewel-like terrine studded with asparagus
and shiitake mushrooms, and wrapped in blanched leek.
</P>
<P>
   And recipes may not work. My first choice was a non-traditional
spicy bean dip layered with goat cheese, cilantro and green onion.
It required cooking black beans in order to have the necessary
liquid, but the recipe produced a mixture closer to soup than
scoopable dip.
</P>
<P>
   But any cook with a copycat flair can benefit from Martha's
entertaining techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Try using hollowed-out rounds and pullman loaves of bread as
serving pieces _ no, not for dip. Use them as containers to keep
sandwiches fresh during a party. Since height adds style, stack
crackers into veritable pillars for a more striking appearance.
Need more verticals? Cut the crudites into long strips and arrange
them in tall clear glasses like flowers. It's a much prettier
visual impact.

 &HT;    Drew promise, personality win over Cards
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Shawon Dunston calls J.D. Drew a superstar in the
making.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting coach Mike Easler believes he's Wade Boggs with power.
</P>
<P>
   And St. Louis Cardinals manager Tony La Russa compares Drew, a
rookie from Hahira, to John Elway. And he's not talking about arm
strength.
</P>
<P>
   As he began his football career, Elway was criticized for not
wanting to be drafted by the Baltimore Colts. Two years ago, Drew
was criticized for refusing to sign with Philadelphia after the
Phillies drafted him. He spent a season in the Northern League at
St. Paul, Minn., before re-entering the draft the next year and
signing with St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Drew, who strained his right quadriceps Monday while running to
third and sat out Tuesday's game, has been booed in some parks
after getting off on the wrong foot in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most of the baseball world thought, `Here's an
arrogant guy who was doing something real egotistical and
personal,''' said La Russa, who was won over by Drew when they met.
``There's a lot of comparisons between Elway and J.D. Drew: They're
really good men, and there's something that they stood for. And
it's not arrogance; it's not selfishness. It's a principle, but I
haven't asked what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   La Russa said he'll ask Drew to tell his Philadelphia story
``when we've been together longer, when he trusts me . . . to tell
me honestly.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Drew, 23, isn't rehashing the reason he delayed his
major-league debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not even going to get into it; it's all in the past,''
said Drew, whose agent, Scott Boras, also has been blamed for the
rift with the Phillies. ``I don't have any hard feelings against
Philadelphia. Things just didn't work out. St. Louis is a great
town, a great atmosphere and probably a better fit for me.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first game with the Cardinals, in September, Drew didn't
have the burden of high expectations. That was the night teammate
Mark McGwire hit home run No. 62.
</P>
<P>
   The next game, Drew hit a 438-foot home run against Cincinnati
in his fourth big-league at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   This year, in his first spring training, Drew started well, but
struggled at the end. The struggles carried into the regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys were coming up and saying, `Relax. You only got 40
at-bats. It's early in the season. You've got a long career,'''
Drew said.
</P>
<P>
   Drew, who was college player of the year at Florida State, has a
brother, Tim, in the Cleveland organization and another brother,
Stephen, playing in high school. ``They said, `Just go out there
and do what you've always done.' It helps to rebuild your belief in
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when the hits weren't coming, Dunston said, ``He didn't
throw bats or curse. He doesn't curse, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Drew missed three games in late April with a sprained thumb
suffered in a collision at first base, then caught fire as a
leadoff batter. Against Montreal, he hit .364 with three walks, a
stolen base and seven runs. He tied a Cardinals record when he
scored five runs Saturday in a 3-for-4 effort against the Expos.
</P>
<P>
   ``If J.D.'s doing his thing right, wherever you hit him, it's
going to work out,'' La Russa said. ``He's got a good attitude
about not having all the answers and wanting to learn. The best
thing that can happen this year is just be on a good ballclub and
be surrounded by guys he can learn from.''
</P>
<P>
   That's easy in a clubhouse with such veterans as McGwire, Eric
Davis and Dunston.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a rookie, but he doesn't act like one,'' Dunston said.
``He's confident but not cocky. Everybody likes him. He's only 23,
but he's from the old school.''
</P>
<P>
   Drew is ``going to be one of the best players ever to play this
game,'' Dunston said. ``When they give him $100 million, you
wouldn't mind, because he's a class act.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Dunston teases him about his contract, a
three-year deal worth a guaranteed $7 million and as much as $11.5
million with bonuses. It's more likely he'll make $8.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say, `You didn't sign for enough,''' Dunston said. ``He just
looks at me. He doesn't say anything. It's a compliment, because
he's so good.''

   By Gary Nuhn DAYTON DAILY NEWS
</P>
<P>
   They were in Scranton, Pa., watching their beloved Toledo Mud
Hens.
</P>
<P>
   They had already been through Rochester and Syracuse on this
trip, wearing their Mud Hen jerseys and hats. But this time the
brothers Ramlow _ Jim and Paul _ thought they were being hassled by
an usher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we came back to our seats, the guy asked to see our
tickets,'' Jim Ramlow said. ``The third time, I said, 'We're the
only guys here wearing Mud Hens shirts. Don't you remember us?' And
he said, 'I'm just doing my job.' But he wasn't asking anybody else
to see their tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though they had planned to stay in Scranton and see the Mud
Hens again the next day, the brothers decided they weren't going to
spend any more money there.
</P>
<P>
   They looked at their trusty minor league schedule and saw that
the nearest Detroit farm team was playing in Welland, Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got in the car at 7:20 the next morning and got to the
hotel in Welland at 1:30,'' Jim said. ``We thought it was a night
game, but it turned out it was Canada Day, so the game started at
1:30. Luckily, the ball park was right next to the hotel, so we ran
over and saw the game.''
</P>
<P>
   End of story? Not for these guys.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, they saw in a newspaper there was another game
that night in St. Catherine's, 20 kilometers away _ whatever that
is. So they drove over and watched that game, too.
</P>
<P>
   Jim and Paul are minor league devotees. They grew up in Toledo,
thus their allegiance to the Mud Hens. Jim, who lives in
Middletown, is an operations coordinator for Rogers Jewelers. Paul,
who lives in Columbus, works in publicity for the U.S. Trotting
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Jim says he's ``over 40.'' Paul is 39.
</P>
<P>
   That was Jim walking around Courthouse Square in his Mud Hens'
uniform on Monday when the new Dayton minor league team unveiled
its name (Dragons), uniforms and logo, ``just to show my support
for minor league baseball,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Every year for the past 11 years, the brothers have made one
week-long trip and another extended weekend trip to minor league
games, mostly but not always following farm clubs of the Tigers.
Their count is now 11 leagues and 63 parks. When Dayton starts next
spring, it's going to be a nice, easy 64th.
</P>
<P>
   Best player Jim has seen? Kirby Puckett when the Mud Hens were a
Minnesota farm team.
</P>
<P>
   Jim's closet is a testament to his devotion. He has six full Mud
Hen uniforms; three Jacksonville uniforms; and one Fayetteville
General uniform (Bull Durham, you understand).
</P>
<P>
   He also has 65 minor league caps, 25 of which hang on his
bedroom wall along with 16 team photos of various Tiger farm teams.
On his wall at work are 10 team photos of the Mud Hens.
</P>
<P>
   So I guess you love the game?
</P>
<P>
   ``You could say that,'' Jim Ramlow said.
</P>
<P>
   Are you married?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not anymore,'' Jim said.
</P>
<P>

   ``Not anymore. That's why we have the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The brothers just returned from a week in Florida. They flew to
Tampa, saw games in Lakeland, Tampa, Lakeland again, Jacksonville,
Lakeland again and finally slipped in two major league games in St.
Petersburg because the Tigers were there.

   ``We had a 6:25 flight back home,'' Jim said. ``Game ended at
4:50, we were in line at the airport with our luggage at 5:20.''

 &HT;    Wooden has knee surgery
 &HT;    By Mark Woods
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ Shawn Wooden not only participated in the
Dolphins' mini-camp last week, the team's former starting strong
safety talked about how his left knee had recovered from the injury
that forced him to miss most of last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost 100 percent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Almost.
</P>
<P>
   Team doctors felt that Wooden was going to need some additional
surgery to remove scar tissue. So they decided to go ahead and do
it Monday, hoping that he will be fully recovered when training
camp opens in late July.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no big deal,'' said Drew Rosenhaus, Wooden's agent. ``The
doctors say that this is par for the course in a rehab of this
magnitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Wooden, 25, tore the anterior cruciate and medial collateral
ligaments in his left knee on the opening kickoff of the second
game of the 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   Wooden's return will be part of one of the biggest off-season
questions for the Dolphins' defense: Who will start at strong
safety in 1999?
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins coaches expect him to battle Calvin Jackson, who
started the final 15 regular-season games last year, and Marcus
Wimberly for the job.
</P>
<P>
   After team physician John Uribe performed the procedure at
HealthSouth Doctor's Hospital in Coral Gables, Wooden left the
hospital with Rosenhaus. No wheelchair necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was walking on it,'' Rosenhaus said. ``He's doing great. I
think the target is for him to be ready for the mini-camp in July
(13-15). But with Shawn, you never know. He might be ready
sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins had high hopes for Wooden last season. He was on
the cover of the media guide as the winner of the team's community
service award. And two years after the Dolphins made him a
sixth-round draft pick out of Notre Dame, he was starting to look
like a steal.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, he won the strong safety job, starting 15
regular-season games and finishing second on the team with 121
tackles.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 season began well. In the opener at Indianapolis,
Wooden made 12 tackles. But on the opening kickoff of the following
week's game against Buffalo, he suffered the injury. He had surgery
the following day, then spent the rest of the year on the injured
reserve list.
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson wasn't available for comment
Monday, but just last week he gushed about the makeup of the
secondary during one of the team's four mini-camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't trade our secondary for any secondary in the
league,'' he said. ``And I don't know if anybody's close. Now we've
got the one safety spot that's still up in the air. But ... we've
got the candidates that we should be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Noteworthy: Guard Mike Sheldon signed a one-year deal Monday.
Sheldon, 25, appeared in nine games last season, starting two.

   STEWART-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ I've never understood about
autographs. I've never been able to figure out why a grown person
would spend an hour standing outside an arena dressing room in
hopes that some sneering, snorting guitar player would scrawl his
name on their scrap of paper? What compels someone to pay for the
privilege of standing line at an autograph session to get the
illegible signature of a 24-year-old whose major contributions to

chest-heaving, end-of-the-world-sobs. The way the world can only
end when you're 7. And the world had indeed ended, for one very
small member of our household _ Stripe, a salamander my son adopted
as a pet. Worse yet, Stripe had not died a natural death. Alec had
covered Stripe's bucket with a dingy-white shawl that protected him
from the light, but not, unfortunately, from 3-year-olds. While
``playing'' with Stripe, Veronica yanked the tail off her brother's

   CERABINO-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ I'm not surprised that
the Ten Commandments died in the Florida Legislature last week.
Senate Bill 52, which would have permitted the posting of The Ten
Commandments in public schools, courtrooms and government
buildings, didn't have a chance. That's because it wasn't handled
right. Good legislation must be flexible to manipulation by the
competing lobbies. There's got to be a little something in it for
everybody. But there was nothing in the Ten Commandments the way it
was presented. Just a lot of don't do this, don't do that. Florida
legislators needed more of a reason to embrace the Ten
Commandments. They needed some Ten Commandments pork. (Cerabino,

in dead last among all 17 candidates in Saturday's three Austin
City Council races. If this had been a NASCAR race, Vrudhula would
have been lapped and run over. Vrudhula even finished behind
Jennifer Gale, a pager-packing transient of questionable gender who
got 691 votes (2.1 percent of the vote) in the City Council Place 4
race for Beverly Griffith's seat. (Kelso, Austin

 &HT;    Doyle finds his place
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAGRANGE, Ga. _ He sits behind the counter on a stool, a ``Gone
Golfing'' sign behind his left shoulder and a stack of mail on top
of the display case. A ringing telephone interrupts his search for
the electric bill, a brochure for a new range-ball picker and a
$315,000 check from the PGA of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drivin' range,'' Allen Doyle answers. ``Uh-huh. . . . Yes, it
is.''
</P>
<P>
   The caller wants to know if Doyle's Golf Center, down
Whitesville Road from LaGrange Mobile Homes and next to Becky's Bar
&AMP; Grill, is still open for business now that the lease-holder owns
a Rolex watch, a new $28,000 pickup truck and three-quarters of a
million dollars in 1999 Senior PGA Tour winnings.
</P>
<P>
   It's quite open for business, thank you. Nothing much has
changed at Doyle's Golf, a facility that makes the range in ``Tin
Cup'' look like a David Leadbetter Academy. The red frame building,
which fronts 11 acres of uneven turf, would not be suitable for
storing weedwhackers on the Senior Tour. But in LaGrange, where
Allen Doyle recharges after his recent euphoric weeks on the Senior
Tour, it's perfectly charming.
</P>
<P>
   What else would you expect from an ex-hockey player from Norwich
University who manufactured an abbreviated, slapshot golf swing in
a garage with an 8-foot ceiling? What better place to find a move
that could have been created from the genetic coupling of Bobby Orr
and Doug Sanders?
</P>
<P>
   ``Small bucket, please, Mr. Doyle,'' a customer says. Doyle, 50,
rings up three bucks on the cash register.
</P>
<P>
   A few moments later, an older fellow enters the shop. ``I just
want to shake your hand, 'cause you're the champ.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1984, when Doyle managed the American Legion course down
the road and was talked into paying $500 for the rights to the
lease, the range has been his comfortable pair of jeans. Years ago,
his daughters ran the place while Doyle was playing in Sunnehanna
Amateurs and Dogwood Invitationals. Now, Michelle and Erin are at
college, and Dad, when he isn't slashing at a ball on national
television, is behind the counter, overlooking the Titleist x-outs
and the animal head covers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was at my house now, what would I be doing?'' Doyle asks.
``I'd be just sittin' there. . . . A place like this, you stay
grounded; you aren't worried. . . . The guys are around, which is
great, and, you know, you don't meet many (jerks) at a place like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Doyle has just returned with his wife, Kate, from Charlotte,
N.C., where Bruce Fleisher beat him on the back nine for his third
victory. But at Doyle's, the congratulations are still coming for
what transpired so dramatically the week before. With a final-round
64, Doyle's second victory of the 1999 season became a senior
major, the PGA Seniors Championship at Palm Beach Gardens, Fla.
Fellow competitor Dana Quigley called it ``the best round Allen
Doyle might ever play in his lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Doyle's buddies are hanging around as usual on this Monday
morning. They call him ``A.D.'' Wearing penny loafers, Doyle is
hitting wedges for a photo shoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to aggravate him,'' Tad Moore said jokingly. He
used to own a golf club company in LaGrange.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle's friends want him to play nine holes, and despite the
stack of mail and a putting green that needs mowing, he is giving
it serious thought. Kate, meanwhile, is gathering Allen's dirty
laundry. Leading money-winner or not, there is no rest for the
weary. They will leave the next day for the stop in Birmingham.
Then they'll drive to Alpharetta, Ga. for the Nationwide
Championship. No ticker-tape parade is on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got on the front page,'' Doyle said. ``That's about all
we're going to get out of LaGrange.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Fagundes runs the Thrifty Car Rental and is part of the
regular group that plays with Doyle at Highland Country Club.
``He's as mentally tough as anybody out there,'' Fagundes said.
``He hasn't changed a lick, and it's funny _ he's made everybody
around him better. I was a 12 (handicap); now I'm a 2.''
</P>
<P>
   Doyle and his buddies usually practice on a better area of grass
behind the shop. There's a tractor parked there that Doyle uses to
work on his trajectory. When he's hitting wedges, the tractor is up
close and balls are lofted over it. The less loft on the club, the
more Doyle backs up the tractor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't any dents in that tractor,'' Fagundes said.
</P>
<P>
   Framed articles of his world amateur standing throughout the
years adorn the walls at the golf shop. While Doyle is a newcomer
to some golf fans, he's no newcomer to golf's headlines. He won
three times after turning pro in 1995, including the Nike Tour
Championship at Roswell, Ga.'s Settindown Creek Golf Club, and the
next year, at age 47, he became the oldest rookie in PGA Tour
history. Doyle won six Georgia Amateur titles, played on two Walker
Cup teams, three World Amateur teams, one with Tiger Woods, and was
ranked the top amateur in the United States in 1994. He was the
medalist in the 1991 U.S. Amateur and lost in the 1992 semifinals
to Justin Leonard. Since Bobby Jones, there has been no greater
amateur player in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   His accomplishments make laughable his exclusion from the
Georgia Golf Hall of Fame. Without saying so officially, the
organization has barred Doyle because of unacceptable behavior that
occurred a decade ago during state amateur events. His temper could
get out of hand back then, but he has mellowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I play these pro-ams; they love me,'' Doyle says. ``I played
the other day with Arthur Blank, the CEO of Home Depot. Now if this
guy had heard I was a (jerk), do you think he'd have arranged to
get me in his foursome?''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Doyle does not care about those things. This is the
nectar period of his life, and nothing bitter is allowed. A plan
that began as something to supply college education money for his
daughters has turned into a lottery jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said when I won the PGA Seniors it would take me 10 years to
make that here at the range,'' Doyle said. ``Everybody who tries
this has the opportunity to go around the carousel and grab the
brass ring. And if you pull the right one, it's a million dollars.
That's what happened to me. . . . It's a little mind-boggling.''
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a guy with a strange swing. The 6-foot-3, 210-pound
Doyle takes back the club barely past waist-high, but his power
comes from thick wrists and thumping forearms. His putting stroke
is almost a push shot. Sometimes the blade only comes back an inch
or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can't believe how strong his hands and forearms and
wrists are,'' his caddie, Todd Byers, said. ``Plus, all those years
in skating built his legs up.''
</P>
<P>
   The swing still causes its share of double-takes. Woods, his
former World Amateur colleague, once said, ``Doyle has no
backswing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's probably not as odd as it looks,'' Doyle said.
``Probably a little slower than it looks, which would give you the
idea it's a little more fluid. . . . But it's short and choppy, you
know, like a slap shot.''
</P>
<P>
   The first time Larry Nelson saw Doyle swing, he said, ``I had
heard about it beforehand. . . . But there are all kinds of swings
out there. That's why on the scorecard, they just ask you, `How
much?' Not, `How?'''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Inman, another Georgian on the Senior Tour, first saw
Doyle's swing during a round at The Farm in Rocky Face. Doyle had
not played in six months because of back surgery and topped his
first three tee shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize it was his real swing,'' Inman said. ``On the
15th hole, he finally got one up in the air; he hits a bad chip,
throws his club and breaks it. Once I played with him again, you
see how good a player he was.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You still get the first-time stuff when people see you,''
Doyle said. ``They say, `What the hell is this?' But out here,
you're not as odd as you'd be on the PGA Tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Doyle said it was important for him to prove that a manufactured
swing from a lifetime amateur could compete with golf's stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be lying if I said I didn't,'' he said. ``That didn't play
any part in coming out, but it was still nice. . . . I mean, I've
been dismissed at every level, and don't think for a minute that
when I played last year and won tour school that any of these guys
were ready to admit that this guy can play.''
</P>
<P>
   Doyle has established a few records that might never be broken.
Last year, he had top-10 finishes on all three tours _ PGA, Senior
and Nike. He has been at least a co-medalist at both PGA Tour and
Senior PGA Tour qualifying schools.
</P>
<P>
   But he has found his comfort zone with the Seniors. He made more
than $200,000 in two years on the PGA Tour, but he constantly faced
the odds of being short off the tee, and that put too much pressure
on his short game.
</P>
<P>
   The gap is much smaller on the Senior Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, instead of 90 percent of the field outdriving me, it's
only 20 percent,'' Doyle said. ``And that's huge. Now, I'm on
pretty much an even playing field with those guys, and I might even
be a shade longer than a few of them with the irons. The guys out
here who bomb it, they don't hit it very straight. If you're
hitting three or more fairways than they are per day, they're
probably gaining nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He drives the ball so well and putts so well, it never puts
him under any pressure,'' Senior Tour player John Bland of South
Africa said.
</P>
<P>
   The Senior Tour's more relaxed, no-cut format has brought out
the finest in many players who were not huge stars on the PGA Tour.
Including Doyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried too hard on the other tour,'' Doyle said. ``I was
telling myself I didn't have much time to make things happen. . . .
Now I'm saying, `OK, you had a good nine. Let's go have another
good nine. Hit the golf shots. Don't worry about what everybody
else is shooting.'''
</P>
<P>
   And suddenly, a typically frugal New Englander at a driving
range in LaGrange no longer worries about affording a used car for
one of his daughters or keeping an old car running until the doors
fall off.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing is the money,'' he said. ``I got to improve
mine and my family's lot in life. I mean, you're doing something
that you love doing, something you always did that you never made a
dime for.''
</P>
<P>
   His only regret is missing a perfect promotional gimmick on the
day he won the PGA Seniors _ pulling out a hockey helmet for the
walk up the 18th fairway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have been like, `He's putting the helmet on,''' Doyle
said, laughing. ``When will be put the helmet on? Heck, it could
have been just like Red Auerbach's cigar.''

   MUSEUM _ ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Museum, an oddball collection of
stuff ranging from Margaret Mitchell's furniture to Adolf Hitler's
silverware, is being liquidated in an estate sale and will likely
be leaving town. Atlanta's last chance to see this home-grown
Ripley's will come Saturday at an open house sponsored by the
Atlanta Preservation Center, which is trying to buy the building
that houses the museum. It's located in the Rose house, a spooky
1900 structure across from Crawford Long Hospital that is one of
the last surving Victorian mansions on Peachtree Street.

   FLA-STILTSVILLE _ BISCAYNE BAY, Fla. _ With Miami slipping
farther away, it's not hard to imagine when sportsmen scouring the
globe for game fish wound up here, sitting around Crawfish Eddie's
beer and bait shack, telling tales of tarpon and bonefish. Or when
a meal at the snazzy Quarterdeck Club cost as much as a night at a
first-rate Miami Beach hotel and yachts, drunkenly navigated,
littered the flats. Or when Plucky Pierre opened the fab Bikini
Club in the 1960s. But that was back when turtle kraals still had
turtles and riding Flipper cost only a couple bucks. Stiltsville is
almost gone now. Of the original 30, only Knight's Bay Chateau and
six neighboring houses remain, desperately clinging to their leases
on the flats in Biscayne National Park's 180,000 acres. Come July,
unless it can be convinced otherwise, the National Park Service
will evict the ``town'' when its 25-year bay bottom leases expire.
Private residences, even if they are largely reserved for weekend
use, have no place in a pristine, public place, the Park Service
says. (Staletovich, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

EUROPEAN ALLIES SHOWING RESOLVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS _ It has become conventional wisdom to say that NATO
underestimated the ability of Yugoslavia and its president,
Slobodan Milosevic, to absorb heavy bombing, day after day.
</P>
<P>
   But less discussed is how badly Milosevic may have judged the
determination of NATO, especially the European allies, to keep
pounding away until he relents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic badly misjudged the Europeans,'' said retired US
Major General William Nash, who commanded Army forces in Bosnia in
1995 and 1996. ``They've put up with him for nine years, and
they've had it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nash says the British and French are especially determined to
see the war through, having unveiled last year an ambitious plan to
create a common European defense policy.
</P>
<P>
   If NATO counted on Milosevic buckling after just a few days of
heavy bombardment, Milosevic had to be hoping that the European
alliance would collapse once the toll of so-called collateral
damage _ civilian casualties _ began to pile up.
</P>
<P>
   But while those collateral damages continue to grow, and while
there has been some grumbling among the European allies, especially
the Greeks and Italians, the level of unity shown by others so far
has surprised even some NATO officials. Polls suggest that overall
support for the air war in NATO countries is running at about
2-to-1.
</P>
<P>
   That unity seems not to have been demonstrably weakened by
NATO's ``mistakes,'' which Yugoslav authorities say have killed
more than 500 civilians in Serbia. NATO claims it is doing
everything it can to minimize civilian casualties, but acknowledges
that a high-altitude air campaign will inevitably lead to mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   The Angus Reid Group, which does polling for The Economist, has
found that support for NATO's action, not just in the 19 NATO
countries but across Europe, has not fluctuated greatly, despite
the casualties from errant bombs and missiles.
</P>
<P>
   After ten years of stoking ethnic hatred, Milosevic may have
started one Balkan war too many for most Europeans. Having absorbed
the refugees and instability caused by Milosevic's wars in Croatia,
Bosnia and now Kosovo, most appear willing to see through a messy,
protracted, restrained war of attrition.
</P>
<P>
   French President Jacques Chirac spoke for many when he said that
Milosevic's policy of forcibly expelling ethnic Albanians from
Kosovo is not only immoral, ``it is anti-European.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk of the war in Kosovo being a test of NATO's
credibility, many Europeans see it as a test of theirs, too. The
European Union, after all, was founded on the premise that if
Europeans were integrated politically and economically, they could
overcome their propensity to wage war against one another.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of World War II, that common purpose has brought
stability and increasing affluence to the continent, with the
notable, tragic and repeated exception of the Balkans, where the
breakup of the former Yugoslavia has created wars and millions of
refugees for a decade. Now, most Europeans appear determined to
drag the Balkans into the 21st century with them.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique Moisi, deputy director of the Paris-based Institute
for International Relations, believes Milosevic badly
underestimated how determined the majority of Europeans are to see
his ability to wage war not simply hobbled, but destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Moisi said the images of ethnic Albanians being driven out of
Kosovo resonate with Europeans, not just those who lived through
the forced explusions and the Holocaust and World War II, but
younger generations who grew up with the lessons of that conflict
embedded in their consciousnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europeans are very much impressed by the power of images, and
the images of refugees have a profound effect on most Europeans,''
said Moisi. ``We are not only united by common values, but by
common emotions. Milosevic is facing not only NATO, but a
combination of Hollywood and CCN.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Vuk Draskovic, the outspoken Yugoslav deputy prime
minister, who spoke daily with European journalists, warned that
the west was determined to see it through. Milosevic fired him.
</P>
<P>
   Elisabeth Pond, author of the just published book, ``The Rebirth
of Europe,'' argues that Europe's determination to confront and
defeat Milosevic underscores how much Europeans have come to see
themselves as a people, not just a collection of individual
countries. She said the photographs of refugees forced out of
Kosovo on trains was a turning point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something in Europe snapped that last week of March, when
those photographs went out all over the world,'' said Pond. ``It
had a galvanizing effect. Europeans are saying they will not have
this happening in Europe in 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Pond, who is based in Germany, said Europeans in general, and
Germans in particular, are torn ``between the idea of no more wars
and no more holocausts.'' The determination to avoid the latter has
overcome the embrace of the former, she says.
</P>
<P>
   While Europeans are appalled by the killing of Serb civilians by
NATO bombs, Pond said most see it as a price that has to be paid,
and comfort themselves by saying NATO's inadvertent killing of
civilians cannot be compared to the deliberate ``ethnic cleansing''
by Yugoslav forces.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks on Yugoslavia amount to the first war led by a
European generation that came of age in the antiwar fervor of the
late 1960s. The left-of-center governments in Britain, France,
Germany and Italy, Europe's most powerful countries, are run mostly
by cabinet ministers who were student activists in the 1960s and
70s _ ``old lefties'' who are now, like British Prime Minister Tony
Blair, among the most outspoken hawks.
</P>
<P>
   Leftist and liberal Europeans who in the past would not support
any form of violent intervention have found justification for a war
that is being fought in the name of dispossesed people with little
geo-political significance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a battle for NATO or for territory. This is a
battle for humanity,'' Blair said Monday after touring a refugee
camp in Macedonia. ``We cannot allow a policy of ethnic cleansing
to be carried out in this part of the world, which is very much
part of Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in what some saw as a startling defense of the war,
one of Germany's most prominent leftist philosophers, Jurgen
Habermas, wrote that technology had changed the porportionality of
death _ that while civilian casualties have historically been
greater than military ones in war, the technology has improved
enough to make this a more just war.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if there is support for the war in unlikely places, Moisi
and others say there is little stomach for sending in group troops
unless Milosevic capitulates. Moisi said European support for the
air war could wither if the campaign drags on, but senses a
stubborn determination across the continent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Czechs are mild in their support because of their past
support for Serbia, and they don't like the idea of force,'' said
Moisi. ``The Icelanders are mild, the Italians are too close, the
Greeks are the Greeks. But what is remarkable is the overall unity.
We don't know what to do, but we're together.''
</P>
<P>
   Moisi said Milosevic is so isolated he doesn't understand that
Europeans have moved on, even if the Balkans have not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europeans say, this is 1999. This sort of thing, forcing
people out of their homes at gunpoint, putting people on trains,
making old people and children walk for miles, this cannot be
allowed to happen,'' he said. ``If Milosevic doesn't realize this
yet, he will.''

FOREIGNERS SIGNING UP AS FIGHTERS FOR KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURRES, Albania _ Struggling to communicate with his Albanian
comrades, Alexander Nunez Ortado, a 19-year-old Spaniard, looks a
bit bewildered as he turns over his passport and application to
join the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   But what he lacks in language skills, Ortado makes up for in
wide-eyed courage and fiery determination to beat back the Serbs
and ``to make Kosovo free,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ortado is too young to remember the Spanish Civil War, but the
romantic history of the great battle has brought Ortado from the
northern Spanish town of Valladolid to this garbage-strewn Albanian
port.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s, foreigners, came to Spain to fight against the
forces of fascist Francisco Franco. Albanians were among them.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Ortado wants to return the favor, helping the struggling
KLA in its war against the bigger and better-armed Yugoslav forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the refugees, the babies, on television and I started to
cry,'' Ortado said in Spanish. ``I said to myself, Alex, you have
to help them. Now, we are going to fight and we are going to free
all of Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign volunteers are increasingly signing up with the KLA,
heading over on the ferry from Bari, Italy, to the makeshift
recruitment center at a beachfront restaurant here, KLA officials
said, though they have no accurate numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hundreds'' of foreigners, most with no Albanian bloodlines,
have offered to fight with the rogue army, said Bilall Sherifi, an
adviser to the KLA in Tirana.
</P>
<P>
   He said some of them are reservists or former officers in their
home countries. The volunteers have come from the United States,
Portugal, Spain, England, Germany and France, he said. One teenage
girl from Chicago, whom he would not name, tried to sign up, but
she was refused because of her age.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have all the intellectual and military world with us,''
Sherifi said. ``They have seen who are the criminals and who are
the victims.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Ortado and KLA officials insisted that the foreign soldiers
were not paid.
</P>
<P>
   Recruitment, KLA commanders insist, is not the problem. Every
day, 150 to 170 volunteers, most of them ethnic Albanians, make the
trek to Durres to join the fight, said Halim Krasniqi, a KLA
commander vetting the new troops here.
</P>
<P>
   Albanians organize bus trips for new recruits coming from
Europe; Ortado hooked up with a recent pack of volunteers in Bari,
and said he found them ``by instinct.''
</P>
<P>
   Most new soldiers are ethnic Albanians who went to Switzerland
or Germany to earn money, and are now exchanging a Western paycheck
for an aged Kalashnikov, Krasniqi said.
</P>
<P>
   They include middle-aged men, skinny teenage boys, even women,
all of whom looked untrained but ready to fight as they lined up to
take the bus to training camps in the north of Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Aida, a 27-year-old woman who was a history professor at the
University of Pristina, said she fled to Switzerland last year
because of troubles with the Serb police. Now, she wants to go to
the front lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not? It's an obligation to my country,'' she said. ``I
don't like war, but it's something I have to do. My people have
been massacred. Do you think I have to be a man to have courage?''
</P>
<P>
   At the Drenica bar, so named for the mountainous region in
Kosovo where the KLA was born, recruits fresh off the boat were
being herded the other day into a sign-up room, protected by armed
KLA soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   While a traditional meal of Albanian bean soup and bread was
served, small children stood on the tables, singing impassioned
songs about Kosovo and the KLA. ``Oh, my mother, please don't cry
for me, because I die for my homeland,'' sang a 6-year-old boy,
stretching his slender arms to the sky with heavy emotion.
</P>
<P>
   The recruits' passports were taken and dumped in a bag, ensuring
the soldiers would not be able to desert easily.
</P>
<P>
   Most recruits will have just three weeks of training, although
the newer ones will be used for support duty and not sent to the
front lines, Sherifi said.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA's greatest problem is a lack of weapons, particularly
big guns and tanks, Krasniqi and others said. Kransniqi estimated
the current size of the KLA at 35,000 soldiers. But without guns,
the recruits are limited to noncombat duty.
</P>
<P>
   None of the volunteers who arrived the other day had guns;
Ortado was the best-outfitted of the lot, with a new-looking army
uniform, boots, and a big knife slung in a leather sheath.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia, of which Kosovo is a province, is under an arms
embargo. Albania is rife with small weaponry, such as Kalashnikovs
and rocket-propelled grenade launchers. But the KLA lacks the tanks
and other heavy equipment to match the firepower of the Yugoslav
military, KLA officials said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO would be better off giving guns to the KLA, instead of
providing their own ground troops, Krasniqi said. That idea is not
popular with many NATO members.
</P>
<P>
   Arming the KLA is a delicate and politically loaded question for
the West, which has insisted it does not back independence for
Kosovo. Giving guns to the KLA would be tantamount to backing the
Kosovar Albanians' fight for independence, many fear.
</P>
<P>
   But Krasniqi said an influx of weaponry, not NATO ground
soldiers _ is critical to KLA success.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have our own soldiers, and we know the territory,'' he
said. ``There is no need for American young people to die for us.''

CLARK KNOWN FOR INTENSITY, BRAVERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS _ Not long after NATO began bombing Serbia, NATO's
supreme commander, General Wesley K. Clark, promised to
systematically attack, disrupt, degrade, devastate, and ultimately
destroy Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's forces.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's boss, NATO Secretary General Javier Solana, quickly
withdrew the word ``destroy,'' saying Clark had misspoken.
</P>
<P>
   But those who know Clark say that was exactly what Clark meant
to say, and what he wants to do. But getting permission from his
political masters to destroy Milosevic's forces is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians are both his sponsors and his bane. Clark is in a
job very few in the Army would have predicted he would get, and a
good number didn't want him to get it. Clark doesn't win popularity
contests in the Army.
</P>
<P>
   But he is extremely popular with the politicians that helped him
win the NATO command two years ago, and with those from the 19 NATO
countries who must approve his actions.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with those who know him and who have worked with him
paint a portrait of contrasting images. Clark's admirers describe
him as a towering intellect, one of the most literate, urbane
generals in the world, a man who understands the complex
relationship between democracies and their armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Muhamed Sacirbey, the Bosnian ambassador to the United Nations,
said Clark has a great empathy for those who don't have the ability
to stand up to bullies, from the Bosnian Muslims who took the brunt
of punishment in the Bosnian war to the ethnic Albanians who have
been expelled from Kosovo today.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is real compassion in all that military strategy,'' said
Sacirbey.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's detractors criticize him as an overly ambitious
micro-manager who does not inspire loyalty. Said one former
Pentagon official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity: ``I
don't know anyone who's worked for Wes who really likes him.''
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton stops here Wednesday to confer with top
NATO officials, it will be a reunion of two men who have a lot in
common, most recently their determination to get rid of Milosevic
once and for all after years of trying to negotiate with him.
</P>
<P>
   Although they did not know each other, Clark and Clinton grew up
in Arkansas. Clark was two years older than Clinton. Both grew up
without fathers, Clark's having died when he was 4. That's when his
mother, a Southern Baptist, took him from Chicago to Little Rock.
Clark later converted to Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
   It was only as an adult that Clark discovered that his
grandfather was a Russian Jew who escaped a pogrom a century ago,
the New York Times reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Wes has that Clintonesque quality, in that when he
talks to you he makes you feel like you are the solitary focus of
his attention,'' said Sacirbey. ``I don't know if he's always
sincere. But I wouldn't confuse sincerity with integrity. I think
Wes Clark's integrity is unquestioned.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Clark and Clinton went to Oxford as Rhodes scholars. But
while Clinton demonstrated against the Vietnam War, Clark was one
of the few Americans in Britain at the time who was willing to
defend US policy. After graduating from West Point, first in his
class in 1966, Clark studied philosophy at Oxford, then went to
Vietnam. There, as a 25-year-old first lieutenant, he made a name
for himself and won a Silver Star when he took four bullets in an
ambush but rallied his platoon to mount a counterattack.
</P>
<P>
   Even Clark's critics do not dispute his bravery, something
Sacirbey saw first hand during the Bosnian war when a car plunged
off a mountain road near Sarajevo, killing three US diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wes Clark rappeled down the mountainside in his dress uniform
to recover the bodies,'' said Sacirbey. ``He was very calm. He was
obviously upset by what happened, but it didn't affect his ability
to deal with the job at hand. He didn't make it a political issue,
as others did. He focused on dealing with the human lives at
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Sacirbey said Clark, who was the military adviser to US envoy
Richard Holbrooke during the Bosnian war, demonstrated that ability
to remain calm during the talks in Dayton that eventually ended the
war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Wes Clark, there wouldn't have been an agreement in
Dayton,'' said Sacirbey. ``He held it together.''
</P>
<P>
   A witty, well-read raconteur, Clark has the ability to win over
people who might not be inclined to like an American four-star
general. The Colombian novelist and Nobel laureate Gabriel Garcia
Marquez is one of them. Long a critic of US policy in Central and
South America, Garcia Marquez admits to having been charmed by
Clark's intellect when they met at the Panama Canal when Clark was
in charge of the Southern Command.
</P>
<P>
   In a recently syndicated column, Garcia Marquez described Clark
as ``a soldier who dreams of being a man of letters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is an elegant man, who likes to stand on ceremony, and his
brothers-in-arms consider him a soldier of the old school, who
shares bread and salt with the troops and who cannot live without
knowing what other people think of him,'' Garcia Marquez wrote.
``What few people realize is that behind the four stars and a
mountain of insignia is an irresistible urge to be recognized as a
political intellectual and an ideologue of social welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia Marquez's take on Clark's self-image resonates with many
who know Clark. But his suggestion that Clark is a ``soldier's
soldier'' does not. Clark is not popular with most soldiers, the
way General Norman Schwarzkopf, the Gulf War commander, was. The
Army, in fact, opposed his appointment as head of Southern Command,
and as NATO supreme allied commander.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not pushed by the Army,'' said Lawrence Korb, a former
Pentagon official who is now studies director at the Council on
Foreign Relations in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Korb said that many in the Army believe NATO should be run by
someone who has spent most of a career in Europe, while Clark was
known mainly for his work in Bosnia. But Clark's political contacts
have carried him beyond Pentagon personality clashes. Despite the
Little Rock connection, it is not Clinton but Clinton's national
security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, who is Clark's biggest
advocate.
</P>
<P>
   Clark has the patience of a long-distance swimmer, which he is.
He swims to stay in shape. In his book, ``To End a War,'' Holbrooke
said Clark's ``boyish demeanor and charm masked, but only slightly,
his extraordinary intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   Sacirbey believes that critics underestimate Clark when they
suggest NATO has started a war it can't win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wes Clark has been underestimated his whole career,'' he said.
``If anyone can bring this to a successful conclusion, it's him.''

WEB SITE PLAYS ROLE IN FINDING MISSING GIRL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By KATHERINE SELIGMAN   
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A 5-year-old California girl was reunited with
her mother after a resident of a small Mexican town recognized the
faces of the missing child and her alleged abductor, the girl's
father, on an Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time the Polly Klaas Foundation's 3-year-old Web
site can be directly credited with solving a case, said Jenny
Thompson, a spokeswoman for the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Sonoma County authorities said the person in Mexico, who
requested confidentiality, had contacted the Petaluma, Calif.-based
foundation with details on the whereabouts of the girl. Foundation
officials gave the information to the district attorney's office in
Sonoma County, which had been working on the case since the girl
disappeared Jan. 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``This person just happened to be on the Web, picked it up and
put two and two together,'' said Sonoma County Deputy District
Attorney Ray Donnelly. ``It was the tip that got (the suspect) back
to the States ... We want to give full credit to that site.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Garstecki, 34, the girl's father, was deported from
Mexico on April 23 and is being held in Ajo, Ariz., on charges of
child stealing. An extradition hearing that would send him back to
California is pending.
</P>
<P>
   The girl ran into her mother's arms last weekend and was
``pleased to be back,'' according to Kristin Allen, the district
attorney's investigator on the case. The girl appeared
undernourished and was extremely dirty, Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had clothing on that didn't fit her by a long shot,''
Allen said. ``She had toddler clothes on and a pair of shoes that
were two sizes too small, and it looked like she'd been wearing
them a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen said additional charges could be filed against Garstecki,
depending on how the girl had been treated.
</P>
<P>
   Garstecki had been sighted at a former home in Joshua Tree in
San Bernardino County, Calif., and in Las Vegas, Allen said. The
man reportedly been working in the computer field while a fugitive
and was living in a house with his daughter when he was
apprehended, Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's mother, who has sole custody, declined comment
Wednesday, but told foundation officials she was grateful for
public support and help during her ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said foundation workers were excited about the role the
Web site had played. ``It's rare that you know this is why'' the
case was solved, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation had passed out brochures about the girl when her
father allegedly failed to return the girl to her mother at the
Santa Rosa Police Department after a visit.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site posted several pictures of the smiling child, who
was among 20 other missing children from the western United States
listed there.

TO STOP THE VIOLENCE, THE PLAY'S THE THING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PATTI HARTIGAN   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two Web sites. Two warnings. One brandishes a recipe for bombs;
the other offers an antidote to violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kill who I don't like,'' boasts the creator of the first
site. ``What I don't like I waste.'' The words accompany drawings
of devils and daggers, pyres and pipe bombs, guns and gore. Throw
in a few references to Adolf Hitler, some blood-curdling lyrics,
and homage to shoot-'em-dead video games. In a screed devoted to
games like Quake and Doom, the author screams, ``Good luck, marine,
and don't forget, kill 'em all!!!!''
</P>
<P>
   On the second site, a parent worries. ``We are all waiting for
the shot to ring out. We're all dreading that phone call that will
follow the gunshot,'' the author writes. ``We are all bonded by our
anxiety that tomorrow morning a potential killer will rise up to
act out his fantasy using us as figures in a video game.''
</P>
<P>
   The first Web site, with its ominous threats, is gone, stripped
from the Internet Tuesday night by American Online. The profile of
its creator, Eric D. Harris, was also taken down by AOL hours after
Harris and classmate Dylan Klebold stormed through Columbine High
School in Littleton, Colo., killing 15. The site's content has been
preserved for investigators at the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   The second Web site, masterminded by playwright William
Mastrosimone and a few colleagues, is mercifully intact. It was
launched three weeks ago as part of a grassroots effort to prevent
another Springfield, Ore., or another Jonesboro, Ark., or another
West Paducah, Ky. _ and, now, another Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   The site offers a gift for teenagers everywhere. That gift is a
play about violence, to be performed exclusively by students in
their own communities. It is available only on the Internet, and
Mastrosimone has vowed that it will never be presented by
professional theaters or be made into a film, despite lucrative
offers. ``I want them to see their peers so that the potential
killer will see the kid who sits next to him up on that stage,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The play was inspired one night last year when one of
Mastrosimone's three children came home from school in Enumclaw,
Wash., and reported that one of the other students had scrawled an
ominous message on the blackboard: ``I'm going to kill everyone in
this class. And the teacher too.''
</P>
<P>
   The playwright couldn't sleep that night. He paced. His mind
raced. And he came up with the idea for the play ``Bang Bang You're
Dead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not an adult in the country who knows what to do
about this, but the kids do,'' said Mastrosimone during a phone
interview from New York. ``The power lies in the kids. The baby
boomers are a failure generation. The government doesn't have a
clue. Our kids are killing each other, and as a parent, I'm going
out of my mind. As I thought about it, in a lightning flash, I
realized these kids need a way to talk to each other. What better
way than the tool of theater?''
</P>
<P>
   The play, which can be performed on a bare stage with minimal
props, spotlights an adolescent who killed his parents and five of
his peers. It opens on his first night in jail, where he is haunted
by the specters of the victims, who ask unrelentingly, ``Why me?''
Their voices won't be silenced: ``Just five bullets wounded
hundreds.'' ``Thousands.'' ``Wounds that bleed.'' ``Wounds that
weep.'' ``Wounds that never heal.''
</P>
<P>
   Mastrosimone took the idea to Michael Fisher, theater director
at Thurston High School in Springfield, Ore., where a 15-year-old
gunman killed two students last May. ``I was guarded at first,''
Fisher recalled. ``The media loves to put everyone's pain on
display, and we weren't going to be parading children around for
the media.'' But Fisher was an admirer of Mastrosimone's work, most
notably his play ``Extremities.'' And the students supported the
idea. ``They all wanted to talk about it; it touched a nerve,''
Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   Mastrosimone originally wanted to publish the play the
old-fashioned way (paper and ink) and deliver it to every high
school in the country. But that changed. ``If I believe my premise,
that the power lies with the kids and not the adults, I had to put
it out on the Internet,'' he said. ``And this is coming from a guy
who's been using a computer for four months.''
</P>
<P>
   So it's out there in cyberspace, along with hate sites like the
one Harris posted on AOL. ``Technology doesn't make us better,''
Mastrosimone said. ``It magnifies what's good in us, and it
magnifies what's bad in us.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Thurston High School debuted the play earlier this month,
scores of other productions have been launched nationwide. And
Mastrosimone is looking for funding to expand the site to include
chat for teenagers about violence.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, the play's the thing. It ends with the gunman
surrounded by the victims as they list the things they miss and the
things they'll never get to do. Ordinary things, teen things, like
flirting or swimming at midnight, the sort of things now being
reported as pastimes of the slain students in Littleton.
</P>
<P>
   Harris's site held a brash warning: ``I kill who I don't like.''
The on-line play, however, shows the gunman after the act. ``I
didn't know it would be forever,'' he says. ``I thought it was
`bang bang you're dead' again. I thought I could hit the reset
button and start over. Why can't I have another chance?''
</P>

TRANSGRESSING A SOFTWARE SIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even though I now attend a Baptist church, I was brought up
Catholic, and have never forgotten the nuns' stern lessons about
honesty and integrity.
</P>
<P>
   So what would Sister Amanda make of Monday's news from Boston
College and the University of Notre Dame? These two redoubtable
Catholic institutions were among the few places in the US to report
serious damage from the Chernobyl, or CIH, computer virus. And
considering how this virus spreads, it would appear that somebody
has been coveting thy neighbor's software.
</P>
<P>
   CIH makes viruses like the much-touted Melissa look downright
primitive. Much has rightly been made of the virus' ability to wipe
out a computer's hard drive. But I'm more impressed by its unusual
ability to destroy a computer's main circuit board, commonly known
as a motherboard.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, this trick would have been impossible. But the
effort to make computers cheaper has also given them a dismaying
new vulnerability, one I've experienced firsthand.
</P>
<P>
   Ever wonder how your computer knows enough to boot itself up?
When you first start it, the processor inside knows nothing. So how
does it figure out how to start up the operating system and get to
work?
</P>
<P>
   What's needed is a bit of software that's built into the
machine's hardware. This program is called BIOS, or basic
input-output system. It runs at startup, telling the computer how
to boot itself. The BIOS program is small enough to fit onto a
single chip called a ROM, for read-only memory.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that you needed special equipment to alter the
BIOS software on a computer's ROM chip. But these days, most PCs
store the BIOS program on a chip called a flash ROM, a cheaper kind
of chip which can be upgraded by running a program on the PC.
Indeed, advanced computer users often ``flash'' their ROM chips to
add new features to the BIOS, like enabling the computer to work
with larger hard drives.
</P>
<P>
   But flashing must be done exactly right. If you load the wrong
instructions onto the chip, it's toast. You must replace the chip,
or the entire motherboard. Lots of people--me, for instance--have
destroyed computers this way. Some manufacturers guard against this
by putting a ``jumper'' on the motherboard that prevents careless
ROM flashing. But many others don't.
</P>
<P>
   You begin to see the fiendish possibilities. A virus that
flashes the ROM would savage your computer so completely that you
wouldn't even be able to boot up with an emergency boot floppy or
CD-ROM. (You do have an emergency boot disk, right? Well, make
one!) Not all Chernobyl-affected computers lost their ROM
chips--some had their anti-flash feature turned on. But others
wound up with a corrupted hard drive and a dead motherboard.
</P>
<P>
   George Smith, editor of the Crypt Newsletter and a respected
virus expert, could think of only one other virus that attacks ROM
chips, and he told me the other one doesn't work. That makes CIH a
fairly sophisticated menace. But then, unlike Melissa, CIH should
also be quite difficult to catch. That's because it works by hiding
itself inside another piece of software _ a computer game, say.
When you run the game, you also run Chernobyl. If you only run
clean programs, legally obtained, a CIH infection is very unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   This should give you a clue as to why so many college students
got the virus, and why it also swept across Asia. Smith doesn't
believe the claims of a half-million infected computers in China,
India and South Korea. Media hype, he says. I'm not so sure.
</P>
<P>
   During a 1995 visit to Hong Kong, I saw store shelves heaped
high with pirated software, sold by sales clerks who cheerfully
admitted the stuff was illegal. Since then, the Chinese are
supposed to have cracked down. Yet the Business Software Alliance
says that 96 percent of all business software used in China is
pirated. And we're not even talking about games.
</P>
<P>
   Like those who make pirated videos by bringing camcorders into
movie theaters, pirate software dealers are none too concerned with
product quality. If a virus slips into the product, that's just too
bad. But a good little Catholic lad would never fall into such a
trap. He'd only use safe, legal software. Which is why I'm so
saddened by the outbreaks at Boston College and Notre Dame. I'd
recommend two Our Fathers and two Hail Marys, but I figure a dead
computer is penance enough.

SOUND THE ALARM! BETTER YET, SET IT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram  DEAR DR.
BOMBAY: Recently, I lost all the programs that I had downloaded. I
had a free program that made my computer make my phone ring at any
designated time. I wanted to tell my girlfriend about this because
she has trouble getting up in the morning, but I haven't been able
to find it anywhere since I brought my computer back up. Can you
help me?
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ Busy Signal
</P>
<P>
   DEAR BUSY: You may be interested in a little technological
innovation that fundamentally changed the way civilization
developed. Its inventors called it ``a clock,'' but you can be sure
the marketing division is hard at work coming up with a snappier
name that focus groups everywhere will love. Something like
``Timemaster SX 2000'' would be my guess.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Clock 2.0 had an amazing enhancement that may solve your
problem. It actually combines an alarm and a clock! I forget what
they called the finished product, but I'm sure marketing will come
up with something infinitely more memorable.
</P>
<P>
   Stop over-teching. Maybe your girlfriend has trouble getting up
because she can't bear the thought of facing another day with
somebody who thinks it's way cool to turn a $3,000 computer into an
alarm clock. Alarm clock! Yes, that's what they called it. I knew
I'd remember it sooner or later, even though ``Sleepender X9'' has
been growing on me.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I hate these here 'puters, but I need to ask
someone with intelligence (?). I suffered a severe crash and had no
choice but to reformat the hard drive. Ever since, I can't run a
disk scan. The message is that some other program is running. There
is nothing running, unless the gremlins are working overtime.
</P>
<P>
   _ Downtown Donna
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DOWN: That's not a gremlin. That's just Bill Gates. He
forgot to wear his lifts.
</P>
<P>
   I know you reloaded from a recovery CD-ROM provided by your
computer manufacturer rather than the Win95 original CD. My guess
is that your original crash hammered your machine a lot harder than
you thought, making even the recovery disk goof up. Or maybe it
loaded stuff you really don't need.
</P>
<P>
   Windows can have all sorts of stuff going on behind the scenes.
Usually, the only way you know about it is if you have a bunch of
dinky little icons in the System Tray in the lower right corner of
your screen. If you've got more than a volume control there,
something else is running.
</P>
<P>
   In Win95, go to the ``Startup'' folder in Programs and see if
anything is loading. Or try un-installing everything you don't need
from the ``Add/Remove Programs'' icon in the Control Panel. See if
anything is on the ``Load'' or ``Run'' lines at the top of the
Win.ini file. But don't go messing with the Registry (which is
where these things are probably loading) unless you know what
you're doing.
</P>
<P>
   You nuked the computer once. Do it again, but buy Win98 and
customize the installation to fit your needs.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: We're so close to the year 2001, yet so far
away from HAL 9000. Would you address that?
</P>
<P>
   _ Starry-Eyed
</P>
<P>
   DEAR STARRY: It can only be attributable to human error. There's
one big problem with visionaries like Arthur C. Clarke and Stanley
Kubrick: Their grasp far exceeds our reach.
</P>

 Increasing Storage Capacity  
 By David Einstein   
 c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Question: &LR;  I'd like to add a second hard drive to increase the
storage capacity of my PC (my original drive holds 2 gigabytes, and
I'm looking at adding one that holds 10 gigs). Is this something I
can do myself, and if so, how hard is it?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  It's actually pretty simple. Your PC case should have
a space called a bay inside it for an extra hard drive. But you
should open the case and make sure that's the case (is that
clear?). Anyway, here's how to install the new hard drive:
</P>
<P>
   _Set the switch on the back of the drive to the ``slave''
position. Also, make sure that your original drive is set to the
``master'' position. That way, the computer will boot using the
original drive, which contains your operating system.
</P>
<P>
   _Slide the new drive into the empty bay and secure it with
screws on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   _Your original drive is connected to the motherboard with a flat
ribbon cable. In the middle of the cable there should be a black
connector that's not being used for anything. Connect it to the
back of your new hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   _Connect the drive to one of the free plugs that extend out of
the computer's power supply.
</P>
<P>
   That's it. Now close the case, fire up the computer and follow
the instructions that came with your new drive to format it and get
it ready.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging E-Mail
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I get an acknowledgment when someone gets the e-mail
I've sent them? I'm sure I figured out how to do it once, but I
can't seem to find my way there again.
</P>
<P>
   A: Both Microsoft Outlook and Netscape Communicator let you
request receipts for when mail is received, and when it's read.
</P>
<P>
   To request receipts for all messages that you send in Outlook
98, choose Options from the Tools menu, then tab to Preferences and
click E-Mail Options. In the dialog box that appears, click
Tracking Options, then select ``Tell me when all messages have been
delivered'' and/or ``Tell me when all messages have been read.''
</P>
<P>
   You can also track an individual message. Open a new e-mail
message window and click Options on the toolbar. In the Voting and
Tracking Options area, check the boxes for the receipt options you
want.
</P>
<P>
   To request receipts for all messages, open your Inbox, then
choose Preferences from the Edit menu. In the Preferences dialog
box, go to the Mail &AMP; Newsgroups category on the left and choose
Return Receipts. Then choose your receipt preferences.
</P>
<P>
   To track an individual Netscape message, open a new message
window, click Options on the toolbar and check the box for Return
Receipt. There doesn't seem to be an option for finding out if an
individual message has been read as well as received.
</P>
<P>
   Banish Your Buddies
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm 79 and very much a neophyte as far as computers are
concerned. I use America Online as my ISP and whenever I access, it
I get a ``Buddies Online'' window in the top right-hand corner. I
couldn't care less about it and need to deluun it. Help!
</P>
<P>
   A: Irritating, isn't it? But fear not, you can banish your
buddies with a few quick mouse strokes. Just click the Setup icon
in the Buddies Online window, then click Buddy List Preferences.
Now remove the check (by clicking it) from the box labeled ``Show
my my Buddy List(s) immediately after I sign onto AOL.`` Next time
you sign on, the buddy window will be gone. You're welcome.
</P>
<P>
   So Sorry
</P>
<P>
   Q: Three years ago, I bought a Macintosh clone _ a Power
Computing PowerCurve 601/120. Loved it. But now the motherboard has
burned out. Can I buy a replacement motherboard now that Power
Computing no longer exists? Or am I just stuck?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're just stuck. The motherboard for your machine is no
longer being made, and an Apple expert tells me that there probably
isn't a current board that would be compatible with your system.
Best bet: Get yourself a new tangerine-color iMac.
</P>
<P>

 &UR; TIP OF THE WEEK &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you download a lot of programs, why not create a folder on
your desktop to hold them all. That way, you won't have lots of
icons cluttering up the desktop, and you'll always know where your
programs are. To create a new folder, right click on any unused
area of the desktop, point to New and choose Folder from the list
of options. Immediately type a name for the folder, then hit Enter.

NORTEL PLANS NEW PRODUCT TO BOLSTER OPTICAL NETWORKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nortel Networks Corp. plans to announce Tuesday that it has
developed a new product that could increase the capacity of fiber
optic communications networks far beyond current technologies.
</P>
<P>
   If the new product successfully makes the transitions from the
laboratory to field trials to the marketplace, it could shore up
Nortel's standing as a leader in optical networking. Nortel, which
changed its name last month from Northern Telecom Ltd. of Canada,
is battling rivals ranging from giants like Lucent Technologies to
start-ups like Sycamore Networks to develop advanced communications
technologies needed to meet rapidly increasing global demand for
Internet data.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of that battle's ferocity, Lucent plans to announce a
product similar to the new Nortel unit in about a month, executives
close to that plan said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The product Nortel intends to announce Tuesday may be as far as
a year away from the marketplace. Nortel hopes to announce a
communications carrier to try the new system within a few weeks and
to begin trials in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The new product could become the most advanced member in a new
family of technologies called wave division multiplexing, which
transmit multiple wavelengths of light, or colors, over a single
optical fiber. A wave-division-multiplexing unit that uses eight
channels, each a different color, could lift the capacity of a
network by eight times a traditional single-wavelength system.
</P>
<P>
   The new Nortel product uses 160 channels, and each channel can
transmit 10 billion bits of information a second. Altogether, the
new system could transmit 1.6 trillion bits a second over a single
optical fiber _ enough capacity to transmit the entire contents of
the Library of Congress across the country in 14 seconds, Nortel
said.
</P>
<P>
   The most advanced unit that Nortel is now shipping offers only
32 channels, but the new unit would leap-frog the most advanced
wave-division-multiplexing products now being sold by its main
competitors: Lucent, Ciena, Fujitsu of Japan and Pirelli of Italy.
</P>
<P>
   One analyst said a product such as Nortel's would offer more
capacity than the communications industry needs now but added that
it could be well suited to the communications appetites of even the
near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our best guess would be that putting this technology out there
is before the market needs,'' said Steven D. Levy, a data
communications analyst with Lehman Brothers, speaking generally
about a super-advanced wave-division-multiplexing technology.
``However, it's only a matter of time before the market gets
there.''

 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ It all started with a broken contract.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Nintendo backed out of an agreement to
include Sony CD-ROM technology in the next generation of its video
game machines.
</P>
<P>
   Sony Corp.'s chairman, Norio Ohga, a notoriously grouchy
business titan, apparently regarded the change of heart as an
affront to his company. So against much internal opposition, Ohga
decided Sony itself would go into the video game business and give
Nintendo Co., then maker of the world's most popular game machine,
a run for its money.
</P>
<P>
   But there was more to it than revenge. Ohga also needed a way to
retain one of his brightest engineers, Ken Kutaragi, who had sworn
to leave if Sony refused to pursue his dreams of making a game
machine unlike anything on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, more than 50 million Playstations have been sold
worldwide, and Sony Computer Entertainment, the business Kutaragi
runs, now accounts for nearly 40 percent of Sony's operating
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Sony has made an even bigger gamble on Playstation,
announcing a corporate overhaul in March that will put the next
version of the game machine at the heart of its reconfigured
empire.
</P>
<P>
   Nobuyuki Idei, Sony's president, sees the machine, or at least
the revolutionary chip at its core, as the first significant
challenge to the Wintel empire, the combination of Intel
microprocessors and Microsoft operating systems that are the heart
and soul of most personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   This has put Kutaragi, regarded at Sony as a bit of a wild card,
in the hot seat _ although he's not one to sweat. ``I don't feel
any different than I did before we made the announcement,'' he
said, perplexed by the suggestion that all this might raise his
stress level. ``We're just going to be forced to educate Sony Corp.
a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Idei is not at all fazed by such talk. ``Sony Computer
Entertainment will play a very important role in changing Sony's
future by encouraging the rest of the company to embrace change,''
he said. ``I don't see any danger that it won't harmonize inside
Sony.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Idei himself has described Kutaragi, 52, as ``a wild
horse,'' and already, the two seem to differ about how to handle
the incredible machine, now dubbed Playstation 2 but likely to be
renamed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're going to do with this thing remains to be seen,''
said Koichiro Chiwata, an analyst at Nikko Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   The tech world is buzzing with speculation. ``This machine has
the power of the highest-end computers masquerading as a game, an
amazing example of what one can do when one pushes the envelope to
its limits,'' said Elias Antoun, executive vice president of the
consumer product division of LSI Logic Corp., which makes the
central processor for the original Playstation and is making the
input-output processor for the new one. It could ``create
opportunities that no one can foresee.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kutaragi, uncharacteristically, seems less ambitious for his
machine, or at least less willing to reveal his extended vision.
``Having Playstation 2 become the core system for the home, that's
Idei-san's point of view,'' he said. ``But for now, we agree it's
going to be for games.''
</P>
<P>
   That's somewhat disingenuous, for Kutaragi is the first to lay
out the machine's ability to connect at high speed to the Internet
over cable and satellite links. He notes the slots it will have to
connect to modems and hard drives and its capacity to recognize
voices and even facial expressions.
</P>
<P>
   The possibilities of interacting with simulations of everyone
from a cartoon character to, say, Leonardo DiCaprio, the actor and
heartthrob, are myriad. ``Imagine a virtual DiCaprio,'' Kutaragi
said. ``He'll be able to wink back at you and smile. He will even
be able to ask you how your day has been.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the level of Sony's investment, the Playstation 2 has to
be more than a game machine. Sony is spending $1 billion to $2
billion, Idei said, to produce the core chip and graphics chips
that make it so revolutionary, and many analysts doubt that it can
recoup that investment as a game machine alone.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Myers, a veteran technology analyst at Jardine Fleming
Securities in Tokyo, estimates that it will cost Sony at least $100
to produce each core chip, which Kutaragi has dubbed the Emotion
Engine for its ability to simulate real-time emotional responses in
its lifelike characters.
</P>
<P>
   Myers said Sony would have to charge at least $500 for a
Playstation 2 to even begin to approach break-even, making it at
least twice as expensive as rival consoles _ and some have
speculated the price will actually run to $700 or $800.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other analysts, Myers questions Sony's ability to
produce Emotion Engines as fast as it has anticipated. Sony has
said it will start selling Playstation 2 in Japan this winter.
</P>
<P>
   The chip is, indeed, a technical challenge. It will be built
using cutting-edge 0.18 micron technology, meaning the circuitry
wire is just 0.18 micron thick, not the 0.25 now typical. Sony has
linked up with Toshiba Corp., which has a strong reputation as a
chip maker, to make the Emotion Engine, but Toshiba has never
mass-produced a chip using 0.18 micron technology.
</P>
<P>
   It is also big and complex, which means there is greater room
for error and lower profitability. At 17 millimeters by 14.1
millimeters, the Emotion Engine will be the biggest chip ever
mass-produced. Chip makers say that for a typical consumer product
with sales in the millions, producing a chip bigger than 8
millimeters has usually been a recipe for disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Kutaragi is well aware that his plans are audacious and that
skepticism abounds, but he's not concerned. ``The architecture is
different from that in current central processors, which are
typically designed for a system of calculation that was started in
the 1970s,'' he said. ``It's very aggressive and powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   The Emotion Engine was developed by a team of Sony and Toshiba
designers and engineers who saw the project through from the
earliest stages of research and development to final production. He
contrasted that with the infamous central processor in the Sega
Dreamcast game console, which was designed by Video Logic, a
British company, and then passed on to NEC for production.
Initially, NEC was able to produce only half the chips it promised.
</P>
<P>
   ``During research and development,'' Kutaragi said, ``there was
no collaboration between the designers and NEC.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so, said Aston Bridgman, an NEC spokesman. ``You can't make
a high-performance machine like Dreamcast,'' he said, ``without all
kinds of close cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   Sony has also adopted the Intel model to churn out the Emotion
Engine. Intel has the same start-up problems that any chip maker
has, but because it typically dedicates one production line to one
chip only, it works out the kinks faster and can then produce mass
quantities with relatively few duds.
</P>
<P>
   Sony is paying some $500 million to retrofit Toshiba's Oita
plant, where the new chip will be made. Kutaragi said he expected
the factory to produce 10,000 chips a month initially and in five
years make enough chips for Sony to sell 20 million Playstation 2
machines a year. Sony is also spending $600 million to $700 million
to build a new chip plant in Nagasaki, which will have two lines
dedicated to making graphics chips for the Playstation 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not expecting the yields to be that high in the beginning,
certainly not to support demand in Japan, the U.S. and Europe,''
Kutaragi said. ``But it's very important for us to reduce the
number of defective chips and recoup our investment, and we think
we can easily do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Antoun, who previously ran LSI Logic's Japan business, has known
Kutaragi since the beginning of Sony's video game business and is
perhaps the foreigner who knows him best. While acknowledging that
the Emotion Engine will be hard to make, he said he had no doubts
that Kutaragi would live up to his promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has vision backed up with a strong understanding of what it
takes to get there,'' Antoun said. ``The basic assumption he's
using is simple: that technology is moving in his favor.''
</P>
<P>
   Kutaragi's confidence is based on Moore's Law, the bedrock rule
of microelectronics that says the density of transistors packed on
a chip will double every 18 months. In other words, even if Emotion
Engine is pushing the envelope now, technology will catch up
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   That belief has guided him throughout his career. In the
mid-1980s, he encountered the first ``chip'' that delivered
graphics in real time. Built by Sony for use in broadcasting, it
was 6 feet tall, 19 inches wide and 25 inches deep and housed
around 20,000 chips. ``I figured that in a decade, that box would
be a single chip,'' Kutaragi said.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time, he bought a Nintendo 8-bit game machine
for his son and found himself fooling around with it. ``I realized
then that in the future, computers and computer science would
change our lifestyle, the way we played and lived,'' he said. He
was upset, however, by the machine's poor sound and pushed Sony to
negotiate a deal with Nintendo to use Sony sound components. That's
the deal that later fell apart, giving birth to Playstation.
</P>
<P>
   Sony had no desire to enter the game business, which was
dominated by Nintendo and Sega and relied on digital technology at
a time when Sony was devoted to analog. Games were toys, after all,
not serious business like TVs and Walkmans.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition discouraged Kutaragi. ``I was very sad,'' he
said. ``But I had a strong passion, so I decided to create my own
space to make my vision a reality, even if that meant leaving
Sony.'' But Sony agreed to set him up in his own company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Ohga-san when we set up Sony Computer Entertainment in
1993 that someday our business would become a big business and
influence our corporate betters in the same way that children
influence their parents,'' he said. ``It's natural, the way of
nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Kutaragi's willingness to leave Sony, highly unusual in
risk-averse Japan, perhaps grew out of his family history. His
father, a native of Japan's southernmost island, Kyushu, returned
from World War II to nothing, moved to Tokyo and started a printing
company. It became quite successful, Kutaragi said, in large part
because the family did everything _ sales, printing, logistics,
accounting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't grow up in the typical salaryman's family,'' he said.
``It was more like growing up in a Jewish family and a Jewish
family business.'' When Kutaragi was 21, his father learned he had
cancer. Kutaragi had just finished engineering studies but got
ready to take over. ``It was interesting enough, it was profitable
and I had known it from when I was one year old,'' he said. ``But
my father told me he didn't want me to succeed him in the business,
he wanted me to be free.''
</P>
<P>
   It was 1975, the height of the first oil crisis in Japan, and
companies had all but stopped hiring. ``I wanted to work at Sony
and so I just went directly to human resources at the
headquarters,'' Kutaragi said. ``Someone at the top thought they
should probably hire a few very funny, unusual people.''
</P>
<P>
   He was one of 43 men and women Sony hired that year; the
previous year, he said, it had hired 660. ``I don't know why they
decided I was interesting,'' he said. ``I was just being myself.''

ALEXA'S CRUSADE CONTINUES  
FREE PC INC. LINES UP FINANCING 
DRAGON DEFIES EXPECTATIONS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It began as a crusade: to archive for posterity the entire
contents of the World Wide Web, which had reached some 13 trillion
bytes at the latest count.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, this crusade by Brewster Kahle had a big
commercial payoff. His three-year-old company, Alexa Internet, was
acquired by the online retailer Amazon.com for nearly $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   Alexa's Internet software is part Web browser, part navigation
service; users download free from the Alexa.com Web site. After
that, whenever the user calls up any Web page, the software lists
four other recommended sites, based on the Web searching patterns
of other Alexa users.
</P>
<P>
   Kahle calls the approach contextual navigation, and Netscape
Communications, which is owned by America Online, has folded Alexa
into the latest version of its browser. While questions remain
about what Amazon.com intends to do with Alexa and its technology,
Kahle insists that the acquisition will give his company plenty of
independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to be part of the Internet infrastructure, much
like the search engines have become,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kahle, who was a founder of the supercomputer company Thinking
Machines in 1983, moved on to the Internet search business. In
1989, well before the World Wide Web took hold, he developed the
Wide Area Information Server _ or WAIS _ for searching distant
databases on the Internet. Kahle sold that company, WAIS Inc., to
America Online three years ago for $15 million in stock, which he
used to bankroll Alexa Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com has said it will let Alexa continue operating as a
separate company with its own headquarters in San Francisco, rather
than folding it into the Amazon.com corporate structure and moving
it to Seattle, as the company has done with nearly every other
acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   The name Alexa refers to the library of Alexandria, where the
ancient Greeks tried to amass the world's knowledge. Kahle said his
deal included a promise by Amazon.com's chief executive, Jeff
Bezos, to let him continue Alexa's ambitious project to archive the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Alexa provided the Library of Congress with a first
installment _ 44 tapes containing 2 trillion bytes of Web data, the
equivalent of 500,000 Web pages. Of course, since the Web continues
to grow by thousands of pages a day, cataloging it all could be a
never-ending task.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, someone has already registered the Internet
address Sisyphus.com.

   Free PC Plans to Announce a List of Big Investors
</P>
<P>
   Free PC Inc., the company that started the free-computer
movement in February by promising to give away 10,000 computers,
contends that it now has the financial backing to support the first
phase of its business model.
</P>
<P>
   The company intends to announce Monday that it has lined up
$33.5 million in financing. Besides Barry Diller, the media mogul,
and the technology ``incubator'' Idea Labs, whose backing had
already been disclosed, Free PC plans to report that its other
investors include Goldman Sachs Group and Moore Capital Management.
</P>
<P>
   Donald LaVigne, chief executive of Free PC, which is based in
Pasadena, Calif., said the company would start shipping 10,000 free
computers next month, at a cost of about $7 million.
</P>
<P>
   The company hopes to make money through advertisements that
would be downloaded from the Internet and constantly displayed on
part of the free computers' monitor. Companies that have agreed to
advertise include Amazon.com; Citigroup's Citibank unit, Ebay; Time
Warner's New Line Cinema, and Volvo, according to Free PC
executives.

   Dragon Systems Postpones Its IPO Indefinitely
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Dragon Systems Inc. announced plans to sell a
minority stake to the public earlier this year, the company has
challenged convention. Amid a crowd of flimsy software industry
start-ups, it has a 16-year track record, real profits and no debt.
In a field run by youngsters, its 50-ish founders are still in
charge.
</P>
<P>
   Now, this little oddball is defying industry expectations once
again: As the typical high-technology entrepreneur races to sell a
stake to the public while the skittish bull market lasts, Dragon is
strolling in the opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   Dragon, whose Naturally Speaking products dominate the market
for continuous-speech recognition software, was originally
scheduled to sell its minority stake in March. But the sale was
quietly postponed, supposedly for a month, after sales in the
fourth quarter of 1998 failed to jump as robustly as many analysts
had expected.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which is based in Newton, Mass., has now decided to
delay the offering indefinitely ``to pursue negotiations with
several potential strategic investors.''
</P>
<P>
   The move has the backing of Seagate Technology of Scotts Valley,
Calif., which owns about 35 percent of Dragon Systems. Seagate, a
leading maker of computer disk drives, has not announced any plans
to sell any shares as part of the public offering.
</P>
<P>
   Business has been exceptionally good, Dragon insists, with
revenue in the first quarter of 1999 setting a company record. But
Janet Baker, Dragon's chief executive, said that seeking private
investment now would allow the company ``to capitalize on the huge
growth potential of the speech market and result in an even more
successful IPO in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Dragon's shyness about going public did not deter Massachusetts
Investor's Digest from listing Ms. Baker and her husband, James
Baker, the pair of computer scientists who started Dragon in their
living room in 1982, among the state's top 10 entrepreneurs for
1999.

`Y2K' BUG TESTS THE PROFESSIONALISM OF PROGRAMMERS 
</HEADLINE>

Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by calling (888)
603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is spelled out in the code of ethics of the Association for
Computing Machinery, one of the world's oldest and largest computer
professional societies: ``An essential aim of computer
professionals is to minimize negative consequences of computer
systems, including threats to health and safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer professionals, the code continues, should warn their
bosses about any such threats and even blow the whistle if their
superiors ignore them.
</P>
<P>
   So why didn't all those computer professionals do the ethical
thing and prevent or blow the whistle on the year 2000 computer
problem _ a glitch that some experts warn could cause such threats
to health and safety as malfunctioning medical equipment and
wayward airplanes when when the clock ticks over to Jan. 1, 2000?
</P>
<P>
   Just how much programmers and their managers should be faulted
for this problem _ which was decades in the making _ is but one
question being raised about a profession that labors in obscurity,
but plays an increasingly vital role in society.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say the year 2000 problem could lead to changes in
the way programs are written, just as earthquakes can lead to
stricter building codes. ``Y2K,'' as the problem is known, has
given new life to a debate about whether programmers should be
required to obtain professional certification, similar to that
required of doctors, lawyers and certain engineers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want an unlicensed engineer working on a bridge, but
you have unlicensed computer programmers working all the time,''
said Dr. Marsha C. Woodbury, chairwoman of Computer Professionals
for Social Responsibility, an 1,800-member group that deals with
social consequences of computing.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure for change could evaporate depending on the extent of
computing problems that occur after the stroke of midnight on Dec.
31. That is when millions of computers could fail to recognize that
the two-digit year date ``00'' means 2000 and not 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, well before New Year's, many computing professionals
see the close of an era. ``This is the end of 50 years of
infatuation and unconstrained trust in what information
technologists can deliver,'' said Paul A. Strassmann, a former
chief information officer for the Department of Defense and the
Xerox Corp.
</P>
<P>
   As Strassmann notes, the government has stepped in, as with the
Securities and Exchange Commission's requirement, which took effect
last fall, that companies file detailed reports on the costs,
timetable and other implications of their Y2K repair efforts. That
was the first such detailed reporting required by the government
for data processing operations. It is one reason that Strassmann
formed the Software Testing Assurance Corp., aimed at verifying
companies' Y2K cleanup efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Even without government pressure, big companies are finding that
the demands of cataloging all their software and repairing and
testing it for Y2K problems has forced them to improve their own
data processing procedures. This could be the silver lining of the
Y2K cloud.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think it helped us all grow up a little,'' said William
D. Friel, chief information officer at the Prudential Insurance Co.
of America. Prudential now keeps better track of what programs it
owns, has eliminated unnecessary programs and has bolstered
procedures for testing software, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For all its high-technology image, developing software remains
more art than science, and a fairly unpredictable art at that.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 46 percent of big corporate software development
projects were either late or over budget, and 28 percent failed
completely, according to a survey of 7,500 projects by the Standish
Group of research advisers in Dennis, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Though the practitioners may speak of themselves as
professionals, computing does not have educational requirements and
licensing that many other professions do. ``Many have called
themselves software engineers,'' said John R. Speed, executive
director of the Texas Board of Professional Engineers. ``Wrong.
They're the local music dropout who chooses to use that title.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas last year became the first state to offer certification
for professional software engineers, although it is not required.
Candidates must have accredited degrees and at least 12 years'
experience or unaccredited degrees and at least 16 years'
experience. A certification test is also being developed.
</P>
<P>
   Like other states, Texas has long required that anyone who
designs a project that is for the public sector or that affects
public safety must be licensed as a professional engineer. Such
requirements were put in place after 1937, when an explosion at an
elementary school in New London, Texas, killed more than 300
children. The cause was a faulty regulator on a gas steam heater.
Nowadays, Speed said, the function performed by that mechanical
device would be handled by software.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the idea of licensing or certifying computer
programmers has long been discussed but never put in place, mainly
because programmers are in huge demand and many of the best do not
have formal training or education.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, some experts say it is not clear that
certification would have prevented the year 2000 problem.
</P>
<P>
   The problem had its genesis in the 1950s and 1960s, when using
two digits instead of four to represent the year in programming
could save expensive computer memory. It was assumed that the
programs would all be replaced by the year 2000. If anything, some
computer professionals say, the millennium bug is a testament to
how well programmers did their jobs, not how poorly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The software was so adaptable it lasted all these years, so we
didn't have to retire it,'' said Tom DeMarco, a programmer, author
and consultant in Maine. ``Our undoing was we did it so much better
than we thought we would.''
</P>
<P>
   Few programmers feel pangs of conscience about Y2K in the way
that some nuclear physicists rue having brought the world the bomb.
A few programmers who say they did sound the alarm contend that
they were ignored by corporate management. Younger programmers see
the problem as one caused by their predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Gotterbarn, director at the Software Engineering Ethics
Institute at East Tennessee State University, said Y2K resulted
from ``lack of foresight and bad guesses,'' not from ethical
lapses.
</P>
<P>
   Where he sees mere mistakes, though, other experts say the
problem was a design flaw that could, and should, have been
prevented _ especially since the two-digit practice continued into
the 1990s, long after computer memory had become cheap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope we see it for what it is _ we've made a giant
quality mistake here,'' said Leon A. Kappelman, an associate
professor of business computer information systems at the
University of North Texas and co-chairman of the Society for
Information Management's Year 2000 working group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would seem our code of ethics would tell us we shouldn't
have done that,'' Kappelman added, ``and once we did it we should
have been more proactive.'' But the code of ethics of the
Association for Computing Machinery, which has 80,000 members in
more than 100 countries, has no force behind it. Most programmers
are not even aware it exists.
</P>
<P>
   As Woodbury of Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility
put it: ``Although computer science departments are supposed to
teach ethics along with programming, it's extremely unpopular.
People like me find ourselves isolated and even laughed at.''
</P>
<P>
   That could change. The Association for Computing Machinery, in
league with the 100,000-member Computer Society of the Institute of
Electrical and Electronic Engineers, adopted a new software
engineering ethics code late last year. The code calls for
programmers to act in the public interest and to ``promote an
ethical approach to the practice of the profession,'' among other
measures.
</P>
<P>
   Just who is responsible for the Year 2000 glitch could become a
legal as well as an ethical question if, as expected, computer
problems lead to widespread lawsuits. A wide swath of corporate
America, including the computer industry, is backing legislation in
Congress that would limit lawsuits and liability for Y2K. Last week
the Senate at least temporarily shelved the bill, which had become
entangled by a number of other, partisan disputes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's get-out-of-jail-free cards,'' Kappelman said.
</P>
<P>
   Within corporations, the year 2000 problem has placed new
scrutiny on chief information officers. Some have been criticized
for not preventing the costly problem. But top management's greater
attention to computer operations can only be good in the long run,
some say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology was just something that happened behind closed
doors and now those doors are opened more,'' said Lauris Nance,
chief information officer of the Public Service Co. of North
Carolina, a gas utility. ``There's a general better appreciation of
the technical staff.'' Ms. Nance herself has received several
promotions for seizing upon the Y2K problem early.
</P>
<P>
   Strassmann, the former Pentagon technology official, predicts
that corporate chief information officers may one day be given
fiduciary responsibility that makes them legally accountable for
computing operations.
</P>
<P>
   Increased pressure on the information chiefs is leading to
change within corporate computing departments. When first
confronted a few years ago with the need to check and fix all their
programs, many computer departments were not even sure what and how
many programs their machines were running. Even when they were
identified, many programs lacked documentation _ the textual
commentaries that are supposed to let a subsequent programmer
follow what the author of the software was trying to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, you had a lot of people fight you about documentation
and stuff,'' Ms. Nance said. Now, she said, programmers meet more
often as teams, and the company uses outside auditors to help
assess the risk of new technology projects.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever changes the year 2000 problem has meant for companies
that use and maintain software, it has placed new performance
pressures on companies that create software. A question in some
pending lawsuits is whether vendors are responsible for fixing
software they sold that is not ready for the year 2000. The need
for lawyers to bone up on software issues has effectively created a
new bar that will be in position to handle software liability
suits, even those unrelated to year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Future contracts are going to have much tighter provisions
about vendor responsibility for unforeseen events,'' said Jim
Jones, manager of the Y2K program at the Information Management
Forum, an organization of information technology executives from
large companies and government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, for many programmers, long stereotyped as antisocial
nerds, the ethics debate has thrust them into an
uncharacteristically visible role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we're going to be the heroes or the goats of
1999,'' Allan E. Alter, a columnist, wrote in Computerworld, a
newspaper for information technology professionals. But ``we must
accept our inevitable public role. What the world wants from us is
level-headed, trustworthy guidance in a scary time.''

COMPANIES DEVELOP ONLINE VOTING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By REBECCA RANEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As president of VoteHere.Net, a start-up company that builds
secure Internet voting systems, Jim Adler hears the same question
from investors again and again. They don't ask about politics or
security. They want to know what would happen if Microsoft moved
into the election business.
</P>
<P>
   Adler has a ready reply: ``Do you think the Justice Department
would let Microsoft run elections in this country?''
</P>
<P>
   VoteHere.Net, which is based in Kirkland, Wash., is one of a
handful of companies that are building systems to enable voters to
cast ballots over the Internet. Since no states allow Internet
voting _ few are even in the earliest stages of contemplating it _
the companies are focusing their efforts on building the trust of
election officials in their products and reputations.
</P>
<P>
   VoteHere.Net is new to the industry, but most of these companies
are already in the election business, selling voting machines and
computer equipment for reading ballot results, and they are
anticipating demand for Internet voting software.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our primary focus is on continuing to sell our products and to
participate in the evolution,'' said Steve Knecht, western regional
manager for Global Election Systems. ``This is going to be a slow
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Global, based in McKinney, Texas, sells touch-screen voting
systems and equipment that scans ballot results into computers. The
company has also developed software to demonstrate how an Internet
voting system would work.
</P>
<P>
   The companies developing Internet voting products plan initially
to sell to non-governmental entities like universities, unions and
professional associations. Online elections among those groups,
company officials hope, will build public trust and brand
recognition that will serve the companies well if and when
legislatures approve online voting in the biggest potential market,
civic elections.
</P>
<P>
   As it stands, only a few state legislatures have begun to
address Internet voting. Bills to initiate studies of the concept
were introduced recently in Minnesota and Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   In California, the Legislature passed a bill to study the issue
in 1997, but it was vetoed by the governor then, Pete Wilson,
because of fears of fraud and vote-tampering. In March,
California's secretary of state, Bill Jones, convened a task force
to study the issue and make recommendations to the Legislature
later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Florida election officials had planned to test online voting
systems in elections this fall, but the project was delayed
indefinitely after cases of voter fraud in Miami raised fears about
security.
</P>
<P>
   On the federal level, the Pentagon, in an effort to make it
easier for far-flung military personnel to participate in the
electoral process, is sponsoring a pilot program through the
federal Voting Assistance Program. The experiment will enable
overseas residents of five states _ Florida, Missouri, South
Carolina, Texas and Utah _ both military and civilian, to vote via
the Internet in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   With the inevitable political starts and stops on this issue,
five years could pass before any state election officials are
authorized to buy Internet voting systems. Moreover, the first
civic election held by Internet will attract substantial scrutiny.
Any problems _ from a breach in security to a glitch in tabulation
_ could prove disastrous for the company that builds the system.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the companies entering the field accept those risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely imperative that it work right the first time,
so we are approaching cautiously,'' said Neil McClure, president of
Worldwide Election Systems in Lafayette, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   To McClure, improved security is one of the best reasons for
Internet voting. ``Any Internet voting system is going to be light
years ahead of a punch-card system in terms of security,'' he said.
``Those ballots are handled by human beings. The count could change
by the mere fact that the ballots were handled.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The three-year-old company has designed an Internet voting
system that can be integrated with its electronic voting machines
(although none of its products are yet on the market). The company
has spent a year adapting encryption technology to ensure the
system's security. Still, the company's strategy is to add online
voting capacity to conventional vote machines _ not to offer
Internet voting software as a stand-alone product.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we're betting the company on this,'' McClure
said.
</P>
<P>
   To a large degree, however, VoteHere.Net is betting the company
on Internet voting.
</P>
<P>
   Though developing these systems is a logical direction for
companies in the election business, VoteHere.Net came to the field
for very different reasons. The company started in 1996 as
Soundcode, which developed data security software. But Adler saw
that field increasingly dominated by large companies like Network
Associates and Security Dynamics.
</P>
<P>
   So he put three engineers in the nine-person company to work
applying their encryption to an Internet voting system. They spent
a year on the project, and now patents for the product are pending.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could be eaten alive or move into a market that's new and
bold,'' Adler said.
</P>
<P>
   Companies already in the election business say that technology
firms like VoteHere.Net are at a disadvantage because they have not
dealt with the politics behind the development of election systems
and the requirements that vary from county to county.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only a few companies nationwide that understand the
election business,'' said Knecht of Global. ``There are many, many
companies interested in Internet voting that have little
understanding of election law.''
</P>
<P>
   Adler, for one, is willing to learn. His company's research
shows that election officials nationwide spend $1 billion a year on
equipment for election day. But he recognizes that the business of
handling election data carries an exceptional burden of
responsibility. ``You have the spotlight on you all the time,'' he
said. ``You have to be squeaky clean.''

REAL NETWORKS PLANS TO OFFER CD SOFTWARE FOR USE ON PC 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In what may be the most ambitious digital-age
challenge yet to the nation's recording industry, Real Networks, a
leading maker of Internet audio software, plans to announce on
Monday a system designed to let consumers copy, store and play
audio compact discs on personal computers. The system is also
designed to enable people to play music transmitted via the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The software, Real Jukebox, will record and play music in
several technical formats including G2, a format developed by Real
Networks, and the increasingly popular MP3 standard that is widely
used by Internet music enthusiasts to swap music files, often
without regard for copyright.
</P>
<P>
   The Real Networks announcement comes as the music recording
industry attempts to hammer out a digital music technology standard
that would protect intellectual property on the Internet. Monday's
announcement seems certain to intensify the debate over music
piracy.
</P>
<P>
   Real Jukebox is meant to conform to copyright law by means of an
electronic ``tether'' that restricts digital copies of the audio
CDs to the hard drive of the user's personal computer; that would
supposedly limit consumers to making but a single copy of a music
file for their personal use. But the software will give users the
option of shutting off the tethering feature.
</P>
<P>
   That would make it possible to attach a copy of a CD track or an
entire CD to an electronic mail message and send it to any number
of friends _ the kind of unfettered distribution that the recording
industry opposes.
</P>
<P>
   Real Networks executives said the company was actively
supporting a variety of copy protection standards, but that it was
also attempting to educate users about the balance between personal
use and intellectual property violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can turn the tethering feature off, but we remind them
that they can't legally take a file and mail it to 100 friends,''
Rob Glaser, chairman and chief executive of Real Networks, said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A user who turns the tether feature off will see an on-screen
dialog box that explains the relevant issues of the Home Audio
Recording Act, a 1992 federal law enacted when digital audio tape,
or DAT, recorders were introduced to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   That law allowed individuals to make a single digital copy of a
copyrighted recording for personal use, but barred further copying
and distribution of the recording to others. In reality, though,
adherence to law depends on the honor system.
</P>
<P>
   Glaser drew an analogy between his company's efforts and those
of manufacturers who produce automobiles that clearly have the
ability to exceed speed limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admit that sometimes I go 57 or 59 or sometimes when I'm
late for a flight, I go 70 and then I feel a little guilty,'' he
said. ``So far on the digital highway, the road hasn't had any
warning signs. This is the software equivalent.''
</P>
<P>
   Real Networks already has standing in the digital music
community by dint of its Real Audio software, the leading software
used for so-called streaming audio _ the broadcast-like
transmission over the Internet of radio programming and other
multimedia Web services. The company says that 60 million people
are registered users of Real Audio.
</P>
<P>
   One significant feature of Real Jukebox, which will be available
both in free and commercial versions, is that it will permit PC
users to make a copy of an audio CD in a fraction of the time it
takes to play it at normal speed _ and to do so even while listing
to the CD on a personal computer. A test version will be available
on Monday for downloading from the Real Networks site on the World
Wide Web, www.realnetworks.com.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Real Networks' tethering strategy will appease the
recording industry is yet to be determined. The Recording Industry
Association of America, an industry group, went to court last year
to try to block distribution of the Rio, a portable player made by
Diamond Multimedia that enables consumers to listen to MP3 computer
files.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a California appeals court heard the
industry association's appeal of judge's refusal to issue a
preliminary injunction banning the Rio.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the Real Networks announcement on Monday, the company
plans to say that Thomson Consumer Electronics Inc., under its RCA
consumer brand, will produce a portable Jukebox Networks player.
Glaser said on Friday that he was in discussions with other
consumer electronics companies that planned to build playback
devices, which he said would reach the market later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the recording industry, which is at work on these
various issues under an effort called the Secure Digital Music
Initiative, has a stated goal of establishing a standard
copyright-protecting format that could be incorporated into
portable players that would reach stores by Christmas. In practical
terms, that would mean providing specifications to electronics
manufacturers by June 30.
</P>
<P>
   But the group behind the digital music initiative is deeply
divided. Among the most contentious of the unresolved issues is
whether new devices should be able to play music recorded not only
with a new, copyright-secure standard but also recordings made with
the existing, nonsecured MP3 format.
</P>
<P>
   The Real Jukebox approach seems to be an acknowledgment that the
pirate-friendly MP3 format has such momentum that the recording
industry will have difficulty extinguishing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The honor system being offered by Real Networks is the wild
card,'' said Richard Doherty, president of Envisioneering, a
consumer electronics and computer industry consulting firm. ``The
Real Networks system is one of the brands that stands a chance of
gaining wide adoption, and this could raise the ire of the music
industry to a whole new degree.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Real Networks system also comes during a period of intensive
innovation and competition between different digital encoding and
compression schemes. Within the last month, both Apple Computer
Inc. and the Microsoft Corp. have introduced their own software for
digital Internet music.
</P>
<P>
   The various competitors are making a range of claims about audio
quality and compression efficiency. Currently, MP3 files require
about a megabyte of storage for each minute of audio playback, but
a number of the proprietary schemes do a much better job with
compression _ meaning that music can be stored in less space on the
user's hard disk. But any compression system has trouble competing
with the sound quality of a CD.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the lower quality audio of Internet music will prove a
market factor is still to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where religion comes in,'' said Steve Fields, a
marketing executive at Pacific Microsonics, a Silicon Valley
company that has developed a technology for improving the audio
quality of CDs. ``In many cases, some of these formats will sound
fine to the untrained ear. But, emphatically, this is not
CD-quality audio.''
</P>
<P>
   That may not matter to the Internet audio market, according to
Doherty. ``These are matters that are highly subjective and age
dependent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The strength of the Real Networks software may ultimately be
that it will permit computer users to build and exchange personal
playlists of songs. Personal computers, Glaser said, offer a level
of control over the sequence of musical selections that is not
possible with today's CD players.
</P>
<P>
   Real Jukebox will also be designed to work with Internet music
sites to permit users to use music search engines, download
recordings and purchase music over the Internet. The company said
Real Jukebox will incorporate Internet music distribution standards
now being developed by both IBM and AT&AMP;T.

Shoot-'em-up games teach about killing 
By Jack Warner  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The events at Columbine High School appear to have
sent the nation into the deepest sort of soul-searching. Why did it
happen, and how can it be prevented?
</P>
<P>
   If the answers were easy, the problem would have been dealt with
long ago. And that's part of the answer _ the problem didn't exist
long ago.
</P>
<P>
   When I was a boy, you could mail-order guns. I had several. I
was also pretty miserable, but it never occurred to me that it
might be cathartic to wipe out my classmates. If it occurred to any
other kid in the 1950s, he didn't act on it.
</P>
<P>
   What's the difference, and what's that got to do with computers?
</P>
<P>
   I think those looking for answers would do well to read a book
called ``On Killing,'' by Lt. Col. Dave Grossman. Grossman is a
psychologist and military historian, and this rather dry and
scholarly book studies the act of killing and its effects on
soldiers at war.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman recounts how, in the waning days of World War II,
studies were conducted which showed that roughly 80 percent of
infantrymen in battle either never fired their weapons at all, or
fired them over the enemy's head. They could not bring themselves
to kill another human being.
</P>
<P>
   This, obviously, is an unsatisfactory state of affairs in the
military, so the Army's psychologists set about trying to find ways
to teach soldiers to overcome their distaste for killing. A few
years later, when hostilities broke out in Korea, the rate of
willing killers had gone up to about 50 percent. In Vietnam, it was
around 90 percent. This was accomplished, Grossman says, by making
a game out of killing.
</P>
<P>
   In World War II, soldiers were taught to shoot by firing at
paper bull's-eyes. Thirty years later, they were shooting at
humanoid silhouettes that popped up, moved around, and fell over
gratifyingly when hit. Soldiers found it a very small step from
this training to the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman concludes his book with a chapter pointing out how well
the entertainment industry is applying these concepts. Nowadays a
single movie will waste more extras in the first 15 minutes than an
entire film studio wiped out in a year when I was a boy; the
killing is even choreographed in slow motion.
</P>
<P>
   Computer and video games are even worse. ``Doom'' inaugurated
the flood of first-person shooters. Everybody loved it. I loved it.
It seemed OK to me; our opponents were, after all, nasty-looking
aliens and monsters. It wasn't long, however, before the rush of
rip-off games presented perfectly human targets. Bad people,
presumably, but bad is often in the eye of the beholder. Games
proudly claim to have more blood and gore than their competition;
body parts are everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   A policewoman told me just last week that she went out to buy
some Nintendo games for her son and was unable to find a single one
that didn't glorify violence. I can't speak for video games, but
there are plenty of fine computer games available with either no
violence at all, or violence reduced to abstract historical
battles.
</P>
<P>
   I would suggest that we need to pay close attention to our
children's computer entertainment. I think it's part of the
problem.

Don't waste that Y2K worrying on the wrong things 
By Bill Husted  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If there were awards for worrying, you'd see my
picture on the cover of Time magazine accepting the trophy for
being the world champion.
</P>
<P>
   And today I worry you are worried about the wrong things when it
comes to the Year 2000 computer problem.
</P>
<P>
   You'll see a lot of hype about what it can mean to computers in
the United States. I was driving in South Georgia the other day and
saw a billboard that advertised a ``Y2K preparedness gun show.''
This stuff is too weird for me to make up.
</P>
<P>
   There are people, not just inmy home state, who are worried
sick about water supplies failing, planes crashing, electrical
grids going dark. Banks are having seminars for their customers _
in fact, that's where I was heading when I saw the billboard _
urging them not to take money out of the bank and bury it in the
back yard because of Y2K fears.
</P>
<P>
   Like I said, I think it's a classic case of worrying about the
wrong thing. To explain why I believe that, we'll have to start
with Melissa.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, the virus called Melissa caught most of the
computing world by surprise and caused all sorts of problems. It
snuck in on an e-mail attachment and then invaded both business and
home computers, causing them to send Microsoft Word documents as
e-mail from the target computer to up to 50 folks. That sort of
traffic choked the Internet and probably embarrassed the heck out
of a lot of people.
</P>
<P>
   Well, no one likes to be caught by surprise. So most folks _
both in the computing business and in the media that cover it _
spent a lot of time worrying about that happening again. When it
came time for a virus called Chernobyl to be triggered (on the
April 26 anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear plant disaster), TV
and the newspapers were full of dire reports of what could happen.
</P>
<P>
   What happened in this country was ... not much. It was a
different story in other parts of the world, especially in South
Korea and Turkey. While there was some damage in the United States,
we were mostly spared. The experts here said part of the reason for
that was, after Melissa, both businesses and individuals worked
hard to update their anti-virus software.
</P>
<P>
   But the resources aren't as great in countries such as South
Korea and Turkey. Chernobyl is a nasty virus all right _ it can
erase a hard disk in an instant. In the countries where it hit
hard, it disabled hundreds of thousands of computers, and it will
cost them megabucks to recover.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson _ to me at least _ is that if you have the money, the
skill and the technology and enough advance warning, you can
prevent computer problems like Chernobyl. But, if resources are
limited, even advance warning won't save you.
</P>
<P>
   By now you may see where I'm heading. While people are worrying
about Y2K disasters here, they may be ignoring the real cause for
worry. I wonder if Chernobyl furnished a dress rehearsal for what
things will be like when the New Year comes.
</P>
<P>
   The realities will be much the same, I'm afraid. Folks in the
United States, rich both in money and resources, have been working
around-the-clock to prevent Y2K disaster. Every reasonable expert I
talk to, including engineers responsible for our utility systems,
tells me they're ready. Systems have been tested and retested. And,
just in case they're wrong (engineers are cautious folk), manual
backup plans have also been tested.
</P>
<P>
   But in some other countries, there are more immediate problems_
like not enough to eat, antiquated computer systems, civil disorder
and massive poverty. While the computer professionals in these
countries may be just as smart and just as worried about Y2K, they
can't afford to throw the equivalent of billions of U.S. dollars at
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   That sets up the possibility that computer systems in poorer
countries will do all sorts of things come New Year's Eve _ none of
them pleasant. Let's not even talk about the really far-out
possibilities _ the computers that control weapons systems, for
instance. Instead, let's just think about the computers that handle
the routine bureaucracy of government.
</P>
<P>
   Things could rapidly move from pretty bad to really horrible in
a lot of these countries. And, unlike a virus attack, some of the
Y2K problems could linger for months and even years. And the United
States, long accustomed to bailing out its neighbors during bad
times, could find that even its deep pockets aren't enough.
</P>
<P>
   So if, like me, you want to worry, then worry about that.

Common Windows 98 problems exposed 
By Charles Haddad  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Windows 98 is such a massive program that you can
never know enough about it. And that fact has produced good fodder
for the PC magazine industry. Take the May issue of PC Computing.
Its cover story is called ``Undocumented Window Secrets.'' Sounds
like the title of some show on the Fox network, doesn't it? Hype
aside, this article offers plenty of helpful hints. The article
identifies 15 common problems with Windows 98. They include such
things as slow Internet connections, clocks that lose time and
disappearing files. The article offers suggestions how to fix these
problems and more.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just corporate computer networks that are threatened by
the Y2K glitch. Many applications you keep on your home computer
are threatened, too. The May issue of PC Computing offers some
guidelines on how to kick the millennium bug off your home desktop
computer.
</P>
<P>
   On CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   There apparently is an unofficial movement under way by the
computer industry to digitize every classic board game. Leading the
charge is Hasbro Interactive. In its latest efforts, the company
has released two collections on computer CD. One is a title called
``Board Games,'' which features some of the best board games. Those
games include chess, checkers, pente, dominoes and connect four. On
the card collection title, called ``Card Games,'' you'll find
spades, cribbage, hearts and gin rummy, among many others. Both of
these CDs are available only for Windows computers.
</P>
<P>
   At last, there's a computer CD about animals that doesn't
involve shooting them. WizardWorks has released a new computer CD
called ``Bird Watcher,'' which calls itself ``an interactive
birding game.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Bird Watcher,'' players view photos and video clips of
birds. And there's a game in which you play a raptor as it hunts
for rabbits and fish. ``Bird Watcher'' is available only for PCs
running Windows 95 or higher.
</P>
<P>
   Online
</P>
<P>
   Learn about the amazing complexity of the planet _ and learn
what is at risk because of a growing number of endangered plant and
animal species. National Geographic has set up a site that explores
this issue through picture, text and sound. You'll find the site at

Server is the traffic cop for a home network 
By Gerry Yandel  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As Paul Harvey says: ``And now for the rest of the
story ...''
</P>
<P>
   Several readers sent e-mail to warn me there is more to setting
up my in-home network than slapping some cable into an Ethernet hub
and wiring all the machines together.
</P>
<P>
   I had planned to write about what else it takes to split one
cable modem throughout the house. After all, I am learning a lot of
this stuff as I go, just as many of you are. But there's no sense
in putting off the inevitable. Let's talk about setting up a
network server.
</P>
<P>
   In order to simultaneously use one Internet provider address,
you'll have to make one of the machines on your network a traffic
cop and communicate with the other machines on your local area
network. In the simplest of terms, this means that one of your
machines will have to be able to talk to the rest of the machines
in your house. It will also allow all the machines to share a
single IP address, by letting you assign them all a secondary
address on your network.
</P>
<P>
   Your server software then acts as a translator between your
Internet provider and your own network, assigning the proper
packets of data to the proper IP addresses.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, say your son is online in his room playing
``Doom'' and you are online doing your banking in the den. The
server will send the packets of ``Doom'' data to the IP address in
the bedroom and the data from the bank's Web server to the IP
address in the den.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious way to set up your server is to buy a cheap PC
to be used only as a server and stash it with the cable modem. As
far as server software goes, there are several flavors and versions
available.
</P>
<P>
   Some readers suggested using Linux, some versions of which come
with Apache server software, but I am not quite at that juncture
yet. It's a learning curve I have been avoiding. (I did buy myself
RedHat 5.2 for Christmas, and I had a great time installing it. But
that's as far as I got.) One reader swears by the ``Linux Edge
Router,'' a small server and Linux kernel that'll run off a floppy
disk. It seemed straightforward enough to a Linux neophyte like
myself.
</P>
<P>
   Another reader suggested Wingate 3.0. A version called Wingate
Home is priced at $39.95 for three users and $69.95 for six users.
</P>
<P>
   The type of software you decide upon will dictate the hardware
required for your server. Linux Edge, like pretty much all
Linux-based servers, runs off a 486 with 16 megabytes of RAM.
Windows NT, obviously, requires a bit more power and, therefore, a
more expensive machine. Wingate Home works with Win95, 98 and NT,
and there are several other products out that will allow you to set
up a server in those operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   It also isn't necessary to have a separate server set up. Any of
your primary computers could also function as the server.
</P>
<P>
   But, with the cheap prices of 486s and Pentiums, there's no
reason not to get a machine to use solely as a server, and it's
probably more advantageous to have a separate server. Having a
machine functioning solely as a server will also bypass problems of
not having enough PCI slots and IRQs for your two Ethernet cards in
one machine.
</P>
<P>
   Also realize that an in-home network is not only for cable modem
sharing. One reader wrote about his in-home network of five
machines all sharing a 33.6 modem.
</P>
<P>
   Even when all five machines are online simultaneously, they get
acceptable access, he writes, although there can be a noticeable
performance drain if some of them are doing packet-intensive work.

Don't blame Internet for kids' bad behavior 
By Frances Katz  
c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ About a decade ago, in my hometown of Leominster,
Mass., two girls from my high school went home together after
school. Then they took a shotgun down from over the fireplace, went
up to a bedroom, put on some Jimi Hendrix and shot themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, everyone blamed Hendrix.
</P>
<P>
   The local and national media converged on our town, putting up
huge satellite dishes in front of my school for our 15 minutes of
morbid fame. They wrote soul-searching articles on disaffected
youth in local and national newspapers. Quite a lot of time and
videotape was spent trying to find something to blame, some outside
influence that could have caused two teen-age girls to end their
lives one day after school.
</P>
<P>
   In the '90s, two troubled high school students in Colorado,
armed with more ammunition than some Third World countries, nearly
succeeded in their plan to murder everyone at Columbine High. In
the aftermath of this horrifying tragedy, the media once again is
searching for something to blame. This time it was their clothes,
the music they liked, the video games they played and the books
they read.
</P>
<P>
   When it was revealed they liked computers, everyone blamed the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   According to a ``Dateline NBC'' poll, 16 percent of adults
surveyed said that limiting teen-agers' access to the Internet
would keep teen-agers from feeling lonely, depressed and isolated.
Limited Web access will keep the jocks from picking on them and
somehow make the high school experience bearable.
</P>
<P>
   I beg to differ.
</P>
<P>
   There were troubled kids before there was an Internet, and there
will be troubled kids long after the Internet becomes as quaint as
the radio or the newspaper. Amazon.com is not Earth's biggest
bookstore; instead it's the Internet itself. The Internet is the
biggest repository of information and misinformation ever
collected. For every disturbed kid asking Lycos to find
bomb-building sites, there are kids reading up on Kosovo, applying
to college, chatting with friends, taking ``How to tell if he/she
likes you'' quizzes or watching the ``Star Wars'' trailer for the
sixth or seventh time. Some of them are building Web sites that
include pictures of the family pet or a recent vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Not every kid with a Web site or Net access wants to blow up his
high school or glorify Hitler. Try a Yahoo! search for Leonardo Di
Caprio or Claire Danes and you'll find numerous fan pages built by
teens devoted to their favorite movie and music stars. Before there
were computers, their grandparents were doing the same thing _
making hard-copy scrapbooks of their favorite stars.
</P>
<P>
   Most teens and any adult worth talking to will tell you that
high school can be a painful experience even for the most
well-adjusted teen. High school can leave emotional scars that take
years to heal. I have friends still harboring grudges against the
person who beat them out for the lead in the spring musical, stood
them up on prom night or drove cooler cars.
</P>
<P>
   Like a lot of kids, I spent a lot of time listening to rock
music, watching TV, hanging out at the mall and talking to my
friends on the phone. There were lots of things I was sure my
parents, as much as they loved me, just wouldn't understand. But
even during my worst years of teen-age misery, I never once
considered blowing up my school, not because I didn't have America
Online to corrupt me, but because I knew it was wrong, and as black
as things may have seemed sometimes, I never thought that violence
was the answer to my problems.
</P>
<P>
   For whatever reasons, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold believed it
was the answer to theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, The New York Times and CNN are on the Web, but so is page
after page of material devoted to every radical fringe group
imaginable. For a troubled teen looking for something, anything to
latch onto, these sites validate their darkest, most disturbing
thoughts and feelings.
</P>
<P>
   But don't use the Internet as a catch-all excuse for everything
wrong with the kids today. If Harris didn't have Net access, he'd
have found other ways to carry out the massacre he had spent more
than a year planning.
</P>
<P>
   Harris may have had access to a vast store of information,
violent video games and Gothic music videos. It seems the one thing
he did not have and desperately needed was access to a network of
adults and peers who could help him cope with his violent feelings,
his despair and his rage. To borrow from William Shakespeare, ``The
fault lies not in the Web, but with ourselves.''

Stock analyst uses PC, touts Apple 
By Charles Haddad  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Even some of those who don't use Macs are falling in
love with Apple Computer. Take Kevin Prigel, a confirmed PC user
and investment analyst at StreetAdvisor.com.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent analysis published on StreetAdvisor's Web site,
Prigel says he's learned to love Apple Computer because of its
soaring stock price.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply put, the Apple Computer story keeps getting better,''
wrote Prigel. ``After beating earnings estimates by a sound 7
percent when every other box maker has been missing estimates, this
company looks poised for a great run.''
</P>
<P>
   Prigel based his comment on seven analytical points.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Prigel said that, since the rollout of the iMac
last August, Apple Computer's sales have increased roughly 10
percent every quarter. That adds up to a whopping 46 percent jump
in sales on an annualized basis, Prigel calculated.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of computer companies increase sales only to see their
profit margins fall through price cutting. Not Apple Computer. Its
gross profits increased 121 percent in the first quarter from the
same period a year earlier, concluded Prigel.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a company that lost nearly $2 billion two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Prigel contends that users no longer care what operating system
is running on their computers _ as long as they can run the
programs they want or need. With Microsoft's commitment to keep
making current versions of its popular software for Macs, Apple's
computers are now on a level playing field with Windows machines,
says Prigel.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Microsoft's Office 98 for the Mac includes features not
yet included in the Windows version of the leading business package
of software titles.
</P>
<P>
   Another Apple Computer strength, says Prigel, is the ease with
which its computers connect to the Internet. He says that no
computers connect faster. ``With an iMac, an inexperienced user can
plug in a power cord and phone line and be online in minutes,''
writes Prigel.
</P>
<P>
   In conclusion, Prigel says, ``Since (Steve Jobs) took over with
Apple Computer floundering, the company has done nothing but
innovate. Believe in Steve Jobs as you would believe in Gates.''
</P>
<P>
   Prigel makes several other points, which you can read for
yourself. His article is fairly easy to follow, even for someone
who is neither a businessman nor an investor.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find the article on the Net at
www.streetadvisor.com/spot/042299/01.htm.
</P>
<P>
   Prigel, by the way, uses a Dell computer and says has no
intention of changing. At least for now.

THE FORCE.NET BE WITH YOU: HOUSTON WEB SITE LEADS A GALAXY OF
INFORMATION FOR `STAR WARS' FANS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK  
c.1999 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ When ``Star Wars'' blasted off in 1977, the biggest
forum where fans could mingle was in lines outside theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Now that seems like a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.
Today's devotees of R2-D2 and the Force are closely entwined on the
Internet, which has propelled them from the dark ages of gleaning
tidbits in magazines to the cyberspace era of having all things
``Star Wars'' instantly at their fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   As ``Star Wars: Episode One _ The Phantom Menace'' nears its May
19 release, this cyber fan base isn't just connected. It seems
almost omniscient.
</P>
<P>
   Just how know-it-all is this new breed of fan?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we've got a copy of the script,'' said Scott Chitwood of
Houston, a founder of www.theforce.net, widely recognized as the
top ``Star Wars'' fan Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Months ago, through one of its many ``spies,'' theforce.net got
a copy of director George Lucas' screenplay for ``TPM,'' the first
film in his ``Star Wars'' prequel trilogy.
</P>
<P>
   Not that they it was posted it online. That would have been
going too far, Chitwood said.
</P>
<P>
   Even when theforce.net does leak information about the film, it
labels some items as ``spoilers.'' Those who want to wait and to
savor the movie's full impact can avoid such things while trolling
the site's many features.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see both sides of it,'' Chitwood said. ``There are people
who really hate it _ who think we're ruining their Christmas
presents. But I think even Lucas feels it's kind of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet some fan-run Web sites push the limits, posting shaky rumors
or facts that should stay secret awhile longer, such as which
characters in the new movie live or die.
</P>
<P>
   Even theforce.net got into hot water with Lucas when it carried
a sound clip of new comic sidekick Jar Jar Binks' voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (Lucasfilm) called us personally and said, `OK, you've
had your fun. We love the fan sites, but this is going too far,'''
Chitwood said. ``And I agreed with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think hearing two lines of dialogue took away from the
film, but they've let us get away with so much that you've got to
respect their wishes. You can't just say, `Sue me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the plot ``is pretty much all out there,'' said Chitwood,
27, a civil engineer who designs offshore structures for Shell
Deepwater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other Web sites have posted the ending of the movie. We've got
that information, too, but there's no way we're going to run with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   None of this would have been possible without the Internet's
elaborate networks of communication between fans and filmmakers
near and far. ``Star Wars'' is big-time on the Net, amassing about
7,000 sites in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Among them, theforce.net is like a daily newspaper. Its home
page is subtitled ``Your daily dose of Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   News is posted daily _ often several times a day _ by Chitwood
and about a dozen colleagues, including co-founder Darin Smith of
Dallas, a friend from their days at Texas A&AMP;M University in College
Station.
</P>
<P>
   That's where theforce.net had its genesis in 1996, just as
``Star Wars'' mania began rising again, but before ``Star Wars''
was an Internet staple.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some sites, but we didn't see any doing what we
wanted: showing news and reviews,'' Chitwood said.
</P>
<P>
   Limited to campus, ``The Star Wars Page at Texas A&AMP;M'' drew mild
interest. It got a few ``hits'' (or Web visits) by Aggie Net
surfers, but when its creators finished graduate studies, they were
unable to pass it on. ``We'd hoped to hand it off to other Aggies,
but nobody else was interested,'' Chitwood said.
</P>
<P>
   So in 1997 _ with Chitwood employed in Houston and Smith in
Dallas _ they launched theforce.net on the Internet, bringing
aboard other far-flung fans they'd met online (including some they
still haven't met in person).
</P>
<P>
   Chitwood is editor ``by default,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Different people do the job as time permits. But what I say
goes, so I take the heat, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Other staffers for the nonprofit site live across the United
States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 26, an aerospace engineer, isn't as active now as before.
``Real life is taking over,'' he said. ``It's fun, but you can't
stay a little boy forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Working in its spare time, theforce.net crew has carved out such
high visibility that Lucasfilm monitors the site. It's also
contributed to stories in Newsweek, Entertainment Weekly and the
Houston Chronicle, as well as being featured on E! and other
television channels.
</P>
<P>
   Monthly operating costs of $2,000 (the site has a commercial
bandwidth) are covered by tiny sponsor ads, with excess funds going
to charity.
</P>
<P>
   Lately the site has attracted 25,000 to 30,000 visitors per day.
When the second ``TPM'' trailer hit theaters and theforce.net had
it online, the site drew 40,000 visitors per day.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago, we were lucky to get 5,000 a day, and when we
first started, 100 a day,'' Chitwood said.
</P>
<P>
   Such a high profile was first sparked by ``Troops,'' a parody by
Kevin Rubio, who set ``Star Wars''' Stormtroopers amid the motifs
of TV's ``Cops.'' Visitors flocked when theforce.net hosted his
video (which it still does).
</P>
<P>
   Then the first trilogy's ``Special Editions'' reached theaters
in '97, ``and that fed this to a large degree,'' Chitwood said. ``A
lot of kids were seeing the films for the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   That was followed by prequel news, which began as a trickle but
has become a flood, eclipsing standing site features such as
discussion forums, editorials, humor and fan fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we update the news every day, we have a loyal fan
base,'' Chitwood said. ``We've become part of people's routine.''
</P>
<P>
   High visibility has made theforce.net a logical place for those
with juicy tidbits to spill the beans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't look for this,'' Chitwood said. ``If somebody has
something they want to spread around, they come to us.
</P>
<P>
   ``One guy sneaked onto the set (of ''TPM``) and took some
pictures. But we keep our sources anonymous.''
</P>
<P>
   Other sites are more like fan clubs _ including www.swgeeks.com,
Web home of the Greater Gulf Coast Star Wars Collectors.
</P>
<P>
   It's designed to unite club members _ roughly three dozen
people, mostly males _ in their pursuit of ``Star Wars'' toys, a
multibillion-dollar industry.
</P>
<P>
   They launched the club in 1997 to help members find toys at
retail and avoid paying inflated prices to collectibles dealers
down the line. Monday was D-Day, when the new film's toys arrived
in stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main goal was to get different sets of eyes out there
looking for our collections,'' said founder Blake Wright of
Houston. ``No member should have to buy a new `Star Wars' toy off
the secondary market from a dealer who gouges. We look out for each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides staying in touch online, the fans also meet monthly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not as crazy as people might think,'' said Wright, a
reporter for an international oil and gas newspaper. ``We're
normal. We have jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many fans that it's a broad spectrum,'' Chitwood
said. ``But most are average people. There are a lot worse
hobbies.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright, 30, bought original `Star Wars' toys years ago, but they
were destroyed in a fire in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drifted away after `Return of the Jedi' left theaters,
around 1984,'' he said. ``Then there was hardly anything new about
`Star Wars' until the summer of '95.''
</P>
<P>
   That's when a new wave of toys swept the market, with Hasbro
(the big toy licensee for `TPM') reissuing old `Star Wars' toys and
figures in updated forms.
</P>
<P>
   Wright started collecting again _ to look, not touch. He keeps
about 80 percent of his items sealed in their display boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Like Chitwood, he's got a room at home filled with ``Star Wars''
memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mythology,'' Wright said. ``America doesn't really have
its own mythology, but `Star Wars' gives us that.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing really special about the story. It's good vs.
evil. But everybody can relate to it. And in 1977, no one had ever
seen anything like it _ had ever seen a `droid' or these other
worlds that Lucas created.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Davidson of Prince George, British Columbia, chief graphic
designer for theforce.net, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars is a fascinating universe from a sci-fi and fantasy
standpoint,'' he said. ``It's a timeless tale of good vs. evil _ of
the fall and retribution of Darth Vader.''
</P>
<P>
   Davidson, 21, wasn't born when ``Star Wars'' arrived in '77, but
still says he was there at the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in my mother's womb when she first saw Star Wars,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The stream of news keeps him extremely busy. ``I could spend
more time on it but have to allocate,'' he said. ``Some people
might say we're too obsessive, but I have another life. There's
school, friends, hobbies, traveling, working out. And there's Star
Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   Chitwood acknowledges the hype, but doesn't think the movie is
overblown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather see Star Wars on the cover of every magazine than
kids getting blown away in Colorado or other harsh realities. This
is a good escape while teaching kids good lessons.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith calls Star Wars ``good clean fun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like Yoda _ the philosophy and wisdom he pours out. A
lot of fans blitz over that, but there's a lot of meat there. I
like the morals Lucas tries to pass on.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith also favors Han Solo as ``a space cowboy.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright won't say who his favorite Star Wars character is.
Chitwood favors Darth Vader, while Davidson prefers Chewbacca.
</P>
<P>
   Other fans are excited about Darth Maul, a new red-faced
villain. ``We've probably seen 10 seconds of him in a trailer, but
he's already been embraced as one evil dude,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Vader, ``He's a good guy who's just misunderstood,''
Chitwood said.
</P>
<P>
   How did Chitwood's fascination start?
</P>
<P>
   He first saw ``Star Wars'' at age 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a loose tooth, and my dad said, `Let me wiggle that
tooth, and I'll take you to see Star Wars.' I said `No way,' but he
grabbed me and pulled the tooth right out and said, `Great. We're
going to see Star Wars.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I cried all the way to the theater _ and now this,'' Chitwood
said. ``Who would have thought?''
</P>
<P>
   Now he and many fans are scheduling vacation time so they can
see the new film the day it opens _ not that the plot will have
many surprises for him.
</P>
<P>
   Chitwood says he probably wouldn't have dug so deeply if he'd
known he'd uncover so much. ``But once you start digging into this
stuff, it's kind of addicting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, we had a full description of the first trailer before
it came out, but when you go into the theater and see it with a
crowd and hear that music, you totally forget everything you knew
before and are just blown away. And I expect that to happen
again.''

WEB AD SPENDING PASSES OUTDOOR MEDIUM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By CAROL EMERT   
 c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just a few years into the World Wide Web's existence,
advertising expenditures on the Internet have surpassed spending on
outdoor ads, an old-as-the-hills medium that includes billboards
and taxi tops.
</P>
<P>
   Spending on Web banner ads, site sponsorships and e-mail
marketing more than doubled in 1998 to $1.92 billion from $906.5
million in 1997, according to a study released yesterday by the
Internet Advertising Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Spending on outdoor ads, meanwhile, totaled $1.5 billion, the
IAB said, citing data from New York ad agency McCann Erickson
Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are remarkable given that the Web is an infant
medium while outdoor ads have been around since Coca-Cola was a
snazzy new drink and Prince Albert tobacco ads graced the sides of
New England barns.
</P>
<P>
   The relative expenditures are also somewhat surprising given
that click-through rates of Web ads _ the frequency with which
people click on the ads _ are falling. As the novelty of banner ads
wanes, click-through rates have fallen to less than .5 percent,
compared with about 1 percent just a year ago, according to
NetRatings.
</P>
<P>
   What the numbers don't reveal is how much of Web ad spending
stems from a calculated strategy and how much is driven by the hype
and optimism that are propelling Net stocks through the roof.
</P>
<P>
   People who make their living from digital marketing acknowledge
that they are working in the equivalent of the Stone Age of the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Internet's strength as an advertising medium may lie
in the future, when, for example, advertisers will be able to
target ads to surfers based on their buying patterns or demographic
characteristics. This is now done to a limited extent by
advertisers on just a few sites.
</P>
<P>
   Even the information generated by tracking ``clickstreams'' is
not being fully utilized. A survey by Jupiter Communications
released yesterday found that only 22 percent of Web advertisers
``make optimal use of clickstream data _ data that is critical to
making intelligent, cost-effective marketing decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's common now for everyone to measure click-through,'' said
Ken Sacharin, media director of Young &AMP; Rubicam San Francisco.
``The new challenge is to measure other things, like what is the
cost per qualified lead,'' in other words, how much it costs to
send an ad to a surfer who meets a profile the advertiser is
targetting.
</P>
<P>
   ``At an even higher level, we want to measure who makes further
inquiries into a product or service, who bought something and who
returned to buy something again,'' said Sacharin.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even with the rudimentary tracking being done today,
``We're already measuring our online campaigns with greater rigor
than we do our offline campaigns in general,'' said Sacharin.
</P>
<P>
   Adds Tim Meadows, vice president of marketing with NetRatings,
``It's hard to click on a billboard and buy something. The Web is
not just a medium that provides content and context but a
marketplace that actually lets people conduct business on it.''
</P>
<P>
   By one measure, Web ads are a bargain. Last year, Net
advertising accounted for about 1 percent of the total $200 billion
in U.S. annual ad spending, yet Web-viewing time accounts for
between 4 and 5 percent of time exposed to all media by the average
American, said Sacharin.
</P>
<P>
   If those revenues were distributed evenly, ``the Web would be
getting $8 (billion) to $10 billion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Pete Petrusky, director of new media for
PricewaterhouseCoopers, ``I think we're in the first inning of
what's going to be an extra-inning game.''
</P>
<P>
   Other findings from the study, which was conducted for the IAB
byPetrusky's team at PricewaterhouseCoopers:
</P>
<P>
   _ Consumer product advertising accounted for 29 percent of Web
ad spending, computers made up 20 percent, financial services 19
percent, telecommunications 8 percent and new media 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Barter deals comprised only 6 percent of Web ad revenues, with
93 percent of such deals paid for in cash. The remaining 1 percent
were parts of broader packages.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fifty-six percent of expenditures were for banner ads, site
sponsorships made up 30 percent, full-screen animated
``interstitials'' 5 percent and e-mail ads 1 percent. A
miscellaneous category accounted for 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ A growing number of Web sites price ads according to
performance benchmarks _ such as whether viewers clicked on the ad
_ instead of simply measuring how many times the ad was flashed on
computer screens. Forty percent of ad spending was priced simply
according to the CPM, or cost per thousand times the banner flashed
on a computer screen. Six percent of ad spending was based purely
on performance measures. The majority, 54 percent of ads, were
``hybrid'' deals that included both cost per thousand and
performance measures.

MAJOR RECORD LABEL TO DISTRIBUTE MUSIC ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Insisting that it cannot afford to wait for the
recording industry to settle divisions over how to distribute
commercial music online, Universal Music, the largest record
company, said Tuesday that it was investing in technology to sell
and distribute music over the Internet by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement signals a major break in ranks with the
Recording Industry Association of America, the industry group that
has been struggling _ with Universal's participation _ to agree on
a standard for selling recordings as data that arrive on a
customer's computer hard drive, instead of on CDs or cassette
tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Universal's sense of urgency is shared by a growing number of
labels.
</P>
<P>
   After long ignoring the Internet, the recording industry now
finds itself rushing to offer consumers an alternative to MP3, a
free technology for delivering music online that is quickly
becoming a de facto standard. The industry hates MP3 because it
does not prevent illegal copying of music and has quickly become a
venue for widespread music piracy online.
</P>
<P>
   Universal, a Los Angeles-based subsidiary of Seagram's Co., said
it was working with InterTrust Technologies Corp. of Sunnyvale,
Calif., to develop software to securely store, sell and distribute
Universal's music online. Universal said it planned have a pilot
version running by the end of the year and that the success of the
pilot would determine the rollout of the full service.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Kenswil, president of Global Electronic Commerce
Universal, whose stable of artists includes Elton John, No Doubt
and Pavarotti, said the company ultimately intended to embrace
whatever standards the music industry settled on for digital
delivery of music. But he said Universal needed to put its
technology in place as soon as possible to have any chance to sell
music online by next Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demand is there, and demand is being filled now by
independent labels and illegal content,'' Kenswil said. ``It's
crazy for us to not recognize demand and move.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts said Universal Music was the first major
record company to publicly announce plans for digital distribution.
A few smaller independent record labels already are selling music
online, joining a handful of artists, including the rap artists
Public Enemy. Some artists are distributing their music in the MP3
format in defiance of their record labels.
</P>
<P>
   Accepting the growing likelihood that the record store of
tomorrow will be the desktop computer or digital listening device,
the recording industry, in concert with the consumer electronics
industry, is struggling to reach a standard for delivering music
digitally. An ad hoc group formed by the industry association,
known as the Secure Digital Music Initiative, has been meeting
twice weekly. SDMI wants to reach a standard by June for portable
devices that play digital music.
</P>
<P>
   Leonardo Chiariglione, head of SDMI, said he was not troubled by
Universal's efforts. He said the concept behind SDMI was to create
overarching standards for distributing digital music but to let
companies adopt their own technologies to meet those standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``SDMI is about a framework,'' he said. ``It's not about telling
them how to do a particular thing.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the organization would meet four more times before
releasing a standard for portable devices.
</P>
<P>
   But while the group meets, MP3's popularity keeps growing. On
Monday, RealNetworks, the leading developer of Internet audio and
video software, released a test version of a program called Real
Jukebox, which enables users to record CDs on their hard drives in
MP3 format. At the same time, Thompson Electronics announced it
would manufacture a portable player for Real Jukebox.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Hardie, a digital music analyst with Forrester Research, a
New York-based market research firm, said Universal clearly had
decided it could not afford to wait for the industry group to reach
a standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``This to me is breaking ranks; they're not waiting for SDMI to
test standards,'' he said. ``It shows that the major record
companies have moved from their original position that everything
via the Internet is bad and pirated to saying this is its time to
begin testing.''
</P>
<P>
   In effect, Hardie added, the labels were saying ``there's no
point in waiting and studying.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenswil disputed the assertion that his company was breaking
ranks. ``SDMI is something that has to run in parallel'' with
Universal's own efforts, he said, adding that InterTrust
Technologies' software would be ``flexible'' enough to comply with
whatever industry standard emerges.
</P>
<P>
   InterTrust Technologies' underlying technology, DigiBox, is
designed to prevent consumers from making and listening to copies
of music they have not paid for.
</P>
<P>
   The technology does not prevent music from being copied; in
fact, for instance, one user could send a copy of a song or album
via e-mail to another user. However, embedded in the music is a
code that prevents the recipient from playing the recording without
first paying for it.
</P>
<P>
   Universal announced in April that it had teamed up with another
record company, BMG, to create a series of Internet sites to
promote and sell music online. But in that case, the sites will
simply take orders for CDs and cassettes and ship them to the
buyers.

SEX OFFENDER INFORMATION GOES ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By KATHLEEN INGLEY   
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The eerie galleries of photos are just a few mouse
clicks away on the Internet. Rapists, child molesters and flashers
stare out from the screen. You can find their names, addresses,
ages and descriptions of their crimes.
</P>
<P>
   There's the Chandler man who spent 10 years in prison for
attempted sex acts with a 10-year-old. A few more clicks lead to
the Yuma man convicted of sexual abuse and attempted sexual
assault, who was jailed two years ago for failing to register as a
sex offender.
</P>
<P>
   You can check out molesters in Michigan, rapists in North
Carolina and Alaska's 1,600-plus sex offenders.
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of a national rush to use the Internet to alert
the public to the identities and whereabouts of registered sex
offenders.
</P>
<P>
   At last count, 15 states were listing sex offenders on Web
sites, with more in the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   And where the states are lagging, counties, cities and even some
individuals are setting up the lists. Arizona's system is scheduled
to go online in January, but four cities _ Chandler, Tempe, Tucson
and Yuma _ already list offenders on their Web sites, and Phoenix
may follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   Some call the Internet a powerful tool for alerting people to
potentially dangerous neighbors. In Florida, a woman discovered
that a sex offender was helping with her son's Boy Scout troop.
</P>
<P>
   Others argue that Internet postings can cause more damage than
they prevent.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, if a database isn't updated when a sex offender
moves, innocent people may find their address identified as the
home of a molester.
</P>
<P>
   One couple in Ann Arbor, Mich., unwittingly bought a house from
a sex offender and then found their address listed on the Internet
_ with no way to get the state to take them off the site until the
man's actual address was found.
</P>
<P>
   Other concerns range from accidentally revealing the names of
victims to creating an instant mailing list for pornographers
looking for customers.
</P>
<P>
   The sex offender Web sites aren't an electronic version of
``wanted'' posters. All the offenders have gone through the courts.
They've served their sentences or are on probation. Now their names
and addresses are registered with local law enforcement, and
they're living out in the community.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet sites typically let you search for offenders by
county, city, ZIP code or name.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an outstanding medium to present information,'' said
crime prevention officer Todd Mittness, who runs the Web site for
the city of Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   Florida began publishing the identities of sex offenders on the
Internet in November 1996, apparently the first state to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Legal Enforcement credits the system with
thwarting some sex offenders before they had a chance to repeat
their crimes and for catching others who had failed to register.
</P>
<P>
   One sexual predator joined a martial arts class and was becoming
very friendly with a young girl in the group. A fellow class member
recognized the man from photos on Florida's Internet site. The
predator was arrested for violating his probation, which prohibited
contact with girls younger than 16.
</P>
<P>
   The offender who volunteered for the Boy Scout troop was on
probation and forbidden to have such contact with youths. His
probation was revoked and he was sent back to prison to finish his
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   California, on the other hand, steered clear of the Internet and
chose to offer access to its sex offender database through a CD-ROM
system in the offices of local law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Access is tightly controlled: You must sign a form, be 18 or
older and provide identification.
</P>
<P>
   The state wants to make sure that sex offenders themselves don't
tap into the database as a way to contact one another, team up or
swap pornography.
</P>
<P>
   The California Department of Justice has set up booths at the
state fair and the Los Angeles County Fair so people can check out
the 69,000 listings on the CD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Van Winkle, an information officer at the Department of
Justice, was helping at the state fair when a 19-year-old woman
decided to run her boyfriend's name just for fun. Then his name and
photo popped up on the screen. She was so upset that she began
hyperventilating, and first-aid workers had to be called.
</P>
<P>
   Of some 100,000 people who have checked the database, Van Winkle
knows of four women who were stunned to find their husbands' names.
</P>
<P>
   California has its own list of success stories, which are posted
on the Internet. There was the pizza deliveryman identified as a
high-risk sex offender, and the molester who was discovered
volunteering at a public school.
</P>
<P>
   And despite California's aversion to the Internet, some of the
state's listings have been posted independently by people who think
they should be available online. Taking advantage of a loophole in
the law, they copy down the information by hand and then put it on
a Web site. So far, the state attorney general has decided not to
challenge them.
</P>
<P>
   It's so easy to pull up the identity of sex offenders with a few
keystrokes that it's easy to ignore the standard warning posted at
Internet sites: The information could be wrong or out of date.
</P>
<P>
   In March, a weeping woman called up the American Civil Liberties
Union of Florida. Her ex-husband was a convicted sex offender just
being released from prison, and it was her address that showed up
on the Internet _ even though they were divorced years ago and he
didn't live there at the time of conviction.
</P>
<P>
   If the state is going to release ``such incendiary information
that can have such devastating consequences,'' said Howard Simon,
executive director of the Florida ACLU, it ought to make sure that
it's absolutely right.
</P>
<P>
   Lucy Ingley, who supervises the sexual offender/predator unit,
says Florida does periodic sweeps to check addresses.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, the ACLU unsuccessfully tried to block the state's
sex offender Internet site after authorities acknowledged that 20
to 40 percent of the addresses were inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason Arizona started verifying the addresses of its
nearly 10,000 registered sex offenders in January, a year before
the names of higher risk individuals are scheduled to go online.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, ``we have to be realistic,'' said Val Biebrich,
sex offender community notification coordinator. Although the first
round is the hardest, he already sees that Arizona won't be able to
double-check most addresses more than once a year. ``You'd have to
have a staff of 30 to 40 people to do it every 90 days,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides mistakes, there's the question of security.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say it's tight. In Chandler, for instance, the site
is encrypted to keep out hackers. Plus, said crime prevention
officer Mittness, who runs the site, ``I'm the only one that has
the program and the password to get into it.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics point out that hackers have broken into some of the
most secure sites in the nation, run by the Pentagon or the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   As people learn to surf the Web to find the names of sex
offenders, pranksters and revenge seekers could set up their own
Web sites purporting to list molesters, said Kim English, research
director at Colorado's Division of Criminal Justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't think anybody has thought this stuff through,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Orlando area, there were several incidents in which
people used information from the state Internet site to create
phony fliers naming innocent people as sex offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Harassment is another worry.
</P>
<P>
   Days after California released its CD-ROM, one sex offender's
car was firebombed. However, state authorities traced the explosion
to teenagers playing with fireworks in an incident unrelated to the
sex offender database.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, Web sites include stern warnings that it's illegal to
use the information to harass offenders. Dallas and several other
Texas cities go a step further, requiring people who access their
sex offender site to furnish their names and addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the Internet push are warning of serious, unintended
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Orr, executive director of the Center Against Sexual
Abuse in Phoenix, fears that the identities of victims could be
accidentally disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   While some Web sites provide only the statute that was violated,
others give more detailed descriptions of the crimes, including
descriptions of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Web sites in Arizona reveal that in one case the victim was a
man's 15-year-old stepdaughter and in another it was the daughter
of the abuser's live-in girlfriend. One Web site discloses that the
victims were 10-year-old friends of the molester's daughter _ and
it names the tiny town where the crimes occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Florida used to include graphic descriptions of sex offenses on
its Internet site, but a year and a half ago, it switched to giving
limited information about the crime and only the general age of the
victim.
</P>
<P>
   Still, victims' advocates wonder about wholesale broadcasting
the names of sex offenders when many crimes are incest. Nationally,
one in four imprisoned for sexual assault preyed on their own child
or stepchild.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to ask ourselves, `What's the real goal here? Was this
necessary?' '' Orr said. ``Of all of the repercussions, has anyone
weighed the positive against the negative? I don't really feel that
anyone has.''
</P>
<P>
   The system is so new that it's hard to foresee how it will play
out.
</P>
<P>
   The local sex offender Internet sites in Arizona have been
online for less than a year. In talks with four offenders listed on
the Chandler and Tempe sites, none knew that their names and faces
were on the Internet, although some had heard the system was in the
works.
</P>
<P>
   None would be quoted by name. All were worried that their
families, some living out of state, would be humiliated. One
suggested that his adult son change his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outing'' people on the Internet could also thwart any
possibility of rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Schroeder, associate director of the ACLU of Southern
California, argues that the probability of repeat crimes is
actually increased ``by making someone's name public and thereby
having people hound the person from community to community,
becoming a wanderer without the ability to put down roots.''

   She received a letter from a middle-age man who was convicted of
a sex crime in his early 20s, did his time in prison and went
through therapy. He's now married, with children, living in a small
coastal town where he's a successful businessman.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he lives in terror that someone will find his name among
the list of sex offenders. ``If one person discovers he's on the
list,'' Schroeder said, ``his business, his family, his life is
ruined.''

   Lately I have been whiling away hours in the nation's departure
lounges, hotbeds of cellular telephony. I am amazed to see the
near-constant use that some businesspeople squeeze out of their
flip-open digital-electronic clams.
</P>
<P>
   At Logan the other day, the man next to me phoned home to say
his flight was delayed by 20 minutes. Half an hour later: ``They're
pre-boarding.'' Then followed a third call to Part Unknown,
informing his doubtless fascinated spouse equivalent that rows 20
to 27 are ready for boarding. Who's paying for this? (His business,
subsidized by the taxpayer.) Who's listening to this? Who knows?
</P>
<P>
   Technology has given modern Americans what they've always
craved: an identity. Until recently there was only one person whose
whereabouts had to be known at all times: the president of the
United States. Monicagate revealed that the Secret Service operates
an electronic system that tells it which White House room the
president occupies. But now Everyman has his or her own Global
Positioning System (GPS) in continuous communciation with home
base. I wish I could intercept the cell-phone traffic emanating
from those tinted-window Range Rovers that are always tailgating me
on Route 128: ``There's a Honda in my way, honey. Should I pass him
or vaporize him?''
</P>
<P>
   Phones are only the start. The early years of the Internet gave
us screen names. My unbearably witty screen name used to be
Ishmalex _ ``Call me Alex'' _ d'ya get it? I've since reverted to
the name my parents gave me. For some, screen names weren't enough;
they became domains: Martha(at)marthastewart.com;
joyce(at)joycemaynard.com, and others.
</P>
<P>
   But there's more. For just a few hundred dollars, you can join
the legion of Web cam devotees who chronicle their lives on
Internet sites. The Belgrade Web cam I've been monitoring seems to
have lost its juice, but for those of you with a zest for foreign
cybertravel, there's a Web cam inside the elephant house at
Amsterdam's Dierenpark Zoo. Boston's famous LaunderettCam at 668
Tremont Street is no longer operative (laundromat closed). But to
fully appreciate the blank torpidity of the genre, check in with
local hero James at www.eco-model.com/James/newwebcam.htm. I'm sure
Web surfers would flock to my hypothetical Web cam site,
www.athomewithalex. Watch Alex hector his children about watching
too much TV. One hour later, see Alex lunch out in front of a
meaningless Celtics-Knicks game.
</P>
<P>
   If you've ever visited a university, you must know that hundreds
if not thousands of students on every campus maintain their own Web
sites. Here's one that I picked at random _
http://stu.cofc.edu/srbozema/ _ but it hardly matters, because
they're all the same. There are always a few pictures, of a child,
a best friend, or that last national park visited. Then you'll have
some tiny freebie fillip _ in this case, the dancing raisins _ the
requisite ``cool links'' to other sites, and usually a list of
dopey jokes. What Emile Durkheim said about suicide notes could
certainly be applied to ``personal'' Web pages: They are all the
same.
</P>
<P>
   Individuality is the opium of the 20th-century masses. The
cruelest fiction promoted by schools, advertising agencies,
politicians, and the stewards of the status quo is that everyone
has something to say; that your tastes are distinctive; that every
person matters. Chances are, you don't. For about half of recorded
history, no one had written an autobiography. Then a sardonically
self-aware bishop from a town called Hippo invented the genre with
``The Confessions of St. Augustine.'' Today's autobiographer: a
veejay (video jockey) named Lisa Kennedy Montgomery of MTV. Who the
hell is she?
</P>
<P>
   It's all quite delusory, the ``personalized'' copies of Time
magazine, the cool screen name, the endless line of homogenous home
pages stretching into cybereternity, the digital GPS navigator
Velcro'd onto the dashboard. To paraphrase a line made famous by
the Firesign Theatre: Why does it matter exactly where you are,
when you aren't any place at all?

REPUBLICANS JOCKEY FOR POSITION IN N.H. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ You always learn something when the clashing
Republican clans convene at the beginning of primary season. What
did I learn Sunday?
</P>
<P>
   --Elizabeth Dole's measured challenge to the gun lobby was a
gutsy gambit in gun-loving New Hampshire. Some grumbling and a
hoarse boo could be heard from the Firearms Fraternity among the
1,200 steak-chewing GOP stalwarts. But female voters may elevate
the post-Columbine gun debate to the top of their concern list. Of
more concern to party pros is Dole's difficulty in raising money,
getting organized, and demonstrating she's ready for the big time.
She gives a neat speech _ but that's maybe one-tenth of the
successful candidate's job description. Her best bet may be to quit
early and ask Bush to make her his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   --Gary Bauer gives a helluva speech. The dimunitive conservative
activist devoted his seven-minute dinner speech to the slaying of
the Columbine schoolgirl who affirmed her Christianity before her
killer fired. It was sober, jarring, a bit out of place, but very
effective. His campaign is a vehicle for the God-squadders who view
abortion and moral decay as top issues.
</P>
<P>
   --Steve Forbes is better than he used to be. The
mega-millionaire still travels in a cocoon of dark-suited
Moonie-like acolytes. But he gave a sober, focused talk that
tax-haters will find persuasive. His financial clout and past
record as an attack-ad wrecker of Bob Dole last time may convince
front-runner George W. Bush to spurn public funding and amass
private money to Do Unto Forbes before Forbes Doeth Unto George W.
</P>
<P>
   --Lamar Alexander is still in the mix. It's troubling he's still
only a single-digit presence here, but his endorsement Sunday by
former US Representative Bill Zeliff was brandished as proof he's
not fading. Lamar was set to raise $1 million Tuesday night at a
Nashville dinner. But Bush is the heavyweight champ of money, and
Forbes doesn't need any.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of Bush, Pat Buchanan, and Senator John McCain
deprived the audience of hearing three men who seem assured of
finishing in the top half of next February's primary. But the
collapse of the Republican Party's leadership in Congress over the
NATO war in Yugoslavia has exposed a chasm in the ``Get Our
President'' party's core: Beyond hating Clinton, what do they stand
for?
</P>
<P>
   It was unsettling to hear a Republican crowd, in the Live Free
or Die state, applauding Alan Keyes for denouncing ``an un-American
war.'' Mrs. Dole's plea _ ``We must win the war because Milosevic
is a war criminal, ladies and gentlemen, we've got to win this
war!'' was greeted less enthusiastically than Dan Quayle's
dismissal of the Balkan war: ``A superpower does not get involved
in civil wars.''
</P>
<P>
   When a rock-ribbed New Hampshire crowd applauds Alan Keyes for
denouncing Clinton as ``morally defective,'' castigates ``15
left-wing NATO governments'' and rails against ``an un-American
war,'' something has gone off the tracks in the Granite State; it
may be the right wing of the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   The voters are still searching for a cause as well as a
candidate. I met a retired Coast Guardsman from California
rubbernecking the GOP field. From his pants pocket he pulled a
campaign button bearing photos of Texas Bush and Mrs. Dole.
Bush-Dole. ``Here's the ticket,'' he said cryptically. But others
are turned off by the royalist notion of backing the son and spouse
of the last two nominees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party needs some new blood,'' insisted Mrs. Mary Caprio,
holding a sign for US Representative John Kasich of Ohio. Her
father was an Irish immigrant who landed in Boston. She was raised
a Democrat, but moved to New Hampshire with husband Pete, who's in
real estate. They pay $12,000 a year in property taxes on their
Nashua home. She ran a coffee party for Kasich, whose theme of tax
relief for the middle class resonates with her.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the white tent corraling the faithful was the man as
responsible as anyone for making Bush Sr. president: former
Governor John Sununu. The old pro planted his candidate, Quayle,
squarely in front of one of two entrances to the dinner, collaring
diners for a photo op with Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John McCain was back home in Arizona celebrating his
son's birthday, but he had one of New Hampshire's most popular
politicians, former Senator Warren Rudman, glad-handing on his
behalf. The McCain crew also featured Senator Chuck Hegel of
Nebraska, another Vietnam War hero, and Ed Alvarez, the
longest-serving POW from that war. McCain's network of war buddies
and veterans may be the Arizonan's secret weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's secret weapon? Either Senator Judd Gregg, or The Popcorn
Cart. Since Gregg's support is no secret, I'll go with the lady who
ladled out free popcorn.
</P>
<P>
   The WMUR-CNN poll Monday had it: Bush 37 percent, Dole 16,
McCain 14, Buchanan 7, Forbes 6, Alexander 5, Quayle 4, Senator Bob
Smith 2, Kasich 1, and Bauer below one. Dole was down from leading
a January survey by 15 points, which split evenly between Bush and
McCain. To her, VP may just look OK.

CARR EXPECTED MORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The new job does not allow him to recite his title
quickly. It's not like two years ago, when ``coach'' or ``GM'' was
all you needed to describe M.L. Carr. Now, as the Celtics'
executive vice president of corporate development, Carr has a title
and job description that cannot be summed up quickly and neatly.
His feelings, however, can be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disappointed,'' says the 48-year-old Carr.
</P>
<P>
   His disappointment does not come from the new job, a position
that requires him to find nontraditional revenue streams for the
Celtics. He said he loves the work. What he clearly doesn't enjoy
is knowing that the season will end with Wednesday's game against
the Charlotte Hornets at the FleetCenter. Carr got a $1 million
bonus for guiding the Celtics to a franchise-worst 15-67 record in
1996-97. The team had two high lottery picks and 10 free agents
waiting for Rick Pitino in the summer of '97. As a Celtic-lover and
Celtic fan, Carr said, he thought he would see more than a 19-30
record at the end of the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the way things were set up, I expected we'd be much
further along at this point,'' he said. ``I never thought we'd be
back in the lottery two years in a row. The reason I say that is
positioning. We had two high draft picks that turned out to be two
good players in Ron Mercer and Chauncey Billups. Couple that with
Antoine (Walker) and some of the other pieces we had, and there was
a reason to be excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Carr discussed many things during a 35-minute telephone
interview Tuesday. He praised Red Auerbach. He said chairman of the
board Paul Gaston has shown a commitment to winning. He said Walker
is a ``fine young man'' who handled being booed well. He said the
renounced Rick Fox could have been a good leader for the young
Celtics. He said a winning Celtic team invigorates New England and
is good for every aspect of the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Celtics' championships have been interwoven into the
fabric of New England,'' he said. ``People say, `I was at
such-and-such company when the Celtics won their 10th.' Or, `I
remember Cousy, Sharman, Russell . . .' ''
</P>
<P>
   One person he never mentioned, directly, was Pitino. But it
seemed obvious that Carr, who has remained in contact with many
former and current Celtics, was not directing his disappointment
toward the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed for everyone involved,'' he said. ``I'm
disappointed for the players, disappointed for the fans. As one of
the caretakers of this wonderful institution, I'm disappointed that
it's been such a grind for us. With the way the system goes, you
have to get worse before you can get better, and we took it there.
I'm sure if you look at it, you'd have to be disappointed in not
winning.''
</P>
<P>
   During his two seasons coaching the Celtics, Carr compiled a
48-116 record, the worst winning percentage (.293) in team history.
Many observers and players understood that the 15-win season was an
unabashed attempt to acquire 7-foot center Tim Duncan in the draft.
But Duncan is now an MVP candidate in San Antonio, while the first
player the Celtics drafted that year _ Billups _ is in Denver. And
some of the other teams who participated in that '97 lottery with
the Celtics and Spurs, such as the Pistons, 76ers, and Bucks, are
headed to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the playoffs, Carr is not overwhelmed by having them
as a goal, either. He recalled a story from the early 1980s when
the Celtics were celebrating the best record in the Eastern
Conference. Auerbach asked what the players were doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said, `Red, we just finished with the best record in the
East,' '' Carr said. ``And he said, `You didn't win anything; we
only celebrate championships in Boston.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Carr has seen comments by Pitino basically guaranteeing that the
Celtics will be a playoff team next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sixteen teams make the playoffs,'' Carr said. ``Obviously you
have to make the playoffs to win a championship. But that should be
a path on the way to winning, not the goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino was not surprised that Carr labeled the season
disappointing; he called it ``one of my least enjoyable'' in 25
years of coaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could talk to John Havlicek and he'd be disappointed,''
Pitino said. ``You could talk to Bill Russell and he'd be
disappointed. Quite frankly, M.L. has no bearing on our
organization at all. If he said positive things, it wouldn't really
have any bearing. We'd rather have positives than negatives, but
there's no disappointment in his remarks. Because nobody is content
or happy about losing.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino's current two-season record is 55-76. This will be the
first time in his career that he ends a two-season stint with a
sub-.500 record. He is confident that will change.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm done coaching, we'll look back and say, `How good did
you do?' '' Pitino said. ``I took over a team that had the worst
record in the history of the Boston Celtics. M.L. got his
opportunity and now I'll get my opportunity. It will speak for
itself. The record will speak for itself, regardless of what
anybody says.
</P>
<P>
   ``His remarks would only be relevant if he were the coach. My
remarks are only relevant when I'm the coach. I don't knock him; I
never have. He had his opportunity to coach, he did his thing, it
was an unsuccessful venture and now we're getting an opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, we're not having great success yet, but we're going to
try and build it and make it back there. I'm on record as saying
that in the third or fourth year we're going to be a playoff
contender and in the fifth or sixth year we're going to be at the
championship level.''
</P>
<P>
   Carr said his mission was to take the team through difficult
times, get it in decent position, and then turn it over to a
``career coach.'' But he did not like it when he saw ``expansion
team'' and ``Celtics'' mentioned in the same sentence. Carr didn't
mention names, but fans may remember that Pitino made the analogy
when talking about building the current Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is an expansion team, it is the first one with 16
championships,'' Carr said. ``There is too much history and pride
with the organization; there is too much richness to put it in that
category. Quite frankly, that is insulting when you have Red
Auerbach here and those 16 great championships.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino clarified his position Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not an expansion team; we're building like an expansion
team,'' he said. ``That's what we're saying. He has to read it the
right way. We're building the same way that the Grizzlies built,
that Toronto built. We're adding free agents, we're doing it
through the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you start over, when you win 15 games, how do you build?
You build through the draft and pick up whatever you can.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing Carr is not disappointed in is the Celtics' last
draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Paul Pierce,'' he said, ``the good Lord smiled on us and
brought him with the 10th pick.''
</P>
<P>
   He likes Dana Barros, Walker, Mercer, and Kenny Anderson, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some good pieces,'' he said. ``I'm just really
looking forward to next year. We'll have our new practice facility,
guys will have a full season to practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all of New England is really dying to see us back on
top. It's a real good feeling, looking to next year. I think
there's a reason to be optimistic.''

A THINKER AND A DOER ON AMERICA'S CITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When he first put his ideas into practice, America was asking,
``Can cities be saved?'' That question today would sound
preposterous during reflections on a 50-year career in public
service from an eyrie high above Boston Harbor, where piers once
rotted and urban dreams died.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cities were written off too soon,'' says Bob Wood. ``Their
commonality with suburbs is increasing and people are realizing
that a strategy against sprawl is not a direct assault on local
governments.''
</P>
<P>
   Battling sprawl is nothing new for Wood. When President Lyndon
Johnson created task forces on housing and urban policy in 1964,
``Charlie Haar and I flew down every Saturday morning at 7:30. He
headed the president's task force on environment and I was chairman
of the task force on urban problems, so we became very good friends
during those weekends. He became assistant secretary of
metropolitan development and I became the first undersecretary of
Housing and Urban Development.'' Wood later became HUD secretary.
</P>
<P>
   In the Great Society's efforts to save American cities,
Cambridge played a major role. Haar taught at Harvard Law School
and Wood was the first chairman of the political science department
at MIT.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sprawl was recognized in the '60s legislation,'' he recalls.
``The idea of metropolitan development was to go hand in hand with
urban renewal and what we were doing with the Model Cities program.
It was explicit, but given Vietnam and the budget, we couldn't fund
it and do well. We only did pieces of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Vietnam took so much energy, time, money, and political
capital,'' Wood remembers. Next week, when Lady Bird Johnson will
be hostess at a Texas reunion of LBJ's Cabinet, Wood will not be
eager to greet former Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara ``and
the rest of `the best and the brightest.' '' Wood sees similarities
between Vietnam then and Yugoslavia today: ``It's undeclared,
slowly escalating, with an assumption of falling dominoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood does not praise President Clinton or Vice President Gore
for tackling sprawl, crediting economic forces with highlighting
the problem: ``The Clinton administration had no real interest in
tough decisions on urban issues or any other. Clinton took his
polls from Dick Morris. But the country grew faster than predicted
and the cost of suburban development in housing, schools, and land
became increasingly high. In the '80s, the recession had killed
building development. In the '90s, with propserity, people are
building mansions in the suburbs. Overwhelmingly, political power
is in the suburbs.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1958, long before he moved from Lincoln to the Boston
waterfront, Wood popularized ``Suburbia'' with a book by that title
in which he wrote that, ``Transportation is the central reality of
the metropolitan community.'' After his tenure at HUD, he got a
chance to put his ideas into action locally.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came back from working for LBJ and got declared a war
criminal by students at MIT, Governor Frank Sargent thought it
would be a good idea for me to be chairman of the MBTA. It seemed a
natural,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   One of his proudest achievements is ``the basic transformation
of Somerville. Because of the Red Line extension, we got Davis
Square as we know it. That's why Tufts is blossoming and why
Somerville is where grad students frm Harvard and elsewhere settle.
That's what transit can do. It happened in Quincy, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood has also been Boston school superintendent and president of
the University of Massachusetts. A graduate of Princeton with
degrees from Harvard, he was also director of Joint Center for
Urban Studies at Harvard and MIT.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, this veteran of the 76th Army Infantry Division in
World War II became associate director of Florida's Legislative
Reference Bureau. He got to know and like politicians, which is why
Robert Coldwell Wood, at 75, is unsurpassed as a thinker and a
doer.

IT ISN'T BLACK OR WHITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until Littleton, the suburbs and their largely white denizens
had always found a way to avoid what they assumed was the uniquely
dark violence of the city, a violence that blackened and became
more remote with every media utterance of ``gang!''
</P>
<P>
   When black kids killed black kids in horrifying numbers in this
decade, the acts were depicted as so wild, so brazen, and so
animalistic that any attempt to remind America that these were
still children was pummeled into inaudibility.
</P>
<P>
   There was little concern about alienation, no huge dispatch of
trauma counselors, and no call such as the one made by House
Judiciary chairman Henry Hyde to examine this ``complicated
cultural moment'' and the ``root causes of a crisis among our
young.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was black kids killing black kids, a cacophonous legion
of academics and essayists told us this was evidence of a ``black
pathology'' and an ``underclass.'' This was perfect for a media
culture that seems bent on reinforcing white suburbanites who fled
the city by offering grossly disproportionate depictions of urban
black people as out of control, dependent, and addicted.
</P>
<P>
   This discovery of a ``black pathology'' came as the book ``The
Bell Curve'' revived the racist assertion that intelligence is
fixed at birth. Though America is too polite to agree with this
officially, the prison building boom, which paralleled cuts for
public education, was proof that the suburbs, the fulcrum of
national politics, got the message that ``black pathology'' is
incurable.
</P>
<P>
   The placing of black youth killers in this hopelessly separate
world of social disease has come at a cost to the suburbs. It has
cost them precious time in handwringing, so much that the angst has
become as inordinate as it is sincere.
</P>
<P>
   In white America there have been seven schoolyard shootings in
the last two years in which 17 people have been killed and at least
46 others wounded. But despite the shock that these things really
do happen far from black ghettos and their ``gangs,'' we are not
much closer to gun control or any large-scale attack on violent
culture. Instead, each incident has been allowed to run its course
as a shocking but ultimately aberrant event. Aberrant events need
no deep attention. America has never entertained the concept of a
``white pathology'' and only pays lip service to the idea that its
fate is tied to the ``black'' one.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, the suburbs have remained so convinced of their
innocence that even the worst of young white killers are described
in human ways that no young black killer could ever hope for. When
Kip Kinkel killed his parents and two classmates and wounded 25 in
Springfield, Ore., Newsweek wrote: ``With his shy smile and slight
build, 15-year-old Kip Kinkel has an innocent look that is part
Huck Finn and part Alfred E. Neuman _ boyish and quintessentially
American.''
</P>
<P>
   Littleton offers the suburbs a fresh chance to do something
about violence. All they have to do is look back to the land so
many of their denizens fled from. The cities.
</P>
<P>
   Most American cities have experienced major drops in homicides
in recent years. Boston was a standard-bearer in the area of youth
violence, going 2 1/2 years without a juvenile homicide, from July
1995 to December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In the cities, the denizens who were bludgeoned by street
violence and particularly by the mowing down of young children
decided that enough was enough. On the surface, the main credit for
the drop in violence, the part most amplified by politicians and
the media, was law and order in the form of community policing and
taking the most violent offenders off the street.
</P>
<P>
   But people who really knew the whole picture knew there was a
renaissance going on. Churches, after years of having all the
impact of a burned-up, boarded-up storefront, renewed their
ministry to troubled youths. Male mentoring programs, particularly
in Boston, popped up in several locations to fill idle time with
education and nurturing relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Many public schools instituted antiviolence curriculums.
Teenagers, some with government help and some on their own,
organized peer groups to reach out to troubled friends and steer
them away from guns and gangs. City governments began treating
violence as an issue of public health, making hospital and police
costs the basis for lawsuits by cities.
</P>
<P>
   The cities realized that they could not wait for gun control _
an issue that remains in firm control of the suburbs. They could
not wait for values to be dropped on them given the violent
entertainment produced by powerful corporations and our own
nation's penchant for military might. They could not wait because
they knew that the death of children meant not just funerals, but
dying property values and general fear.
</P>
<P>
   The cities stopped wringing their hands long ago. When the
suburbs dry their eyes from the horror of Littleton, perhaps they
can see that violence was never uniquely dark to begin with but was
quintessentially American. Any serious action on schoolyard
massacres starts with the recognition that black kids were never
all that evil or white kids all that innocent. All our children are
under assault by one pathology, our addiction to guns and our
thirst for violence.

CARING FOR A PARENT OFTEN EXACTS A TOLL ON A JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- When her mother fell in December and it became
apparent that the 89-year-old could no longer live alone, Susan S.
White asked for time off from her employer, BankBoston Corp., to
find an assisted living arrangement for her.
</P>
<P>
   White, 62, a human resources professional at the bank, was given
three weeks of paid leave. ``Essentially, the bank converted some
of the sick days I had to what we call R-days, days you can use to
take care of a relative.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Ryan, 52, and head of the Women's Commission for the City
of Cambridge, tells a different story. Over 18 years, she
accumulated 7 1/2 months of paid sick time. But in the spring of
1998, when her 86-year-old mother was dying of cancer, Ryan learned
that she could not convert more than seven days of her accrued sick
time into paid time off for family care. Ryan, who had already used
four of the seven days, needed at least two weeks to assist her
mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked long hours and squeezed out some comp time and used
some unpaid time, but it was really demoralizing and shocking to
me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Two different workplaces; two different approaches to elder care
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   As the labor force ages, the issue of elder care is becoming
more visible. The Conference Board, a New York research group,
reports that demand for elder care benefits is expected to outstrip
child care by 2003. A small but growing number of employers are
starting to respond to the burgeoning need.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Family and Medical Leave Act provides up to 12
weeks unpaid leave for workers at companies with 50 or more
employees, many workers cannot afford to take any unpaid time off.
Now, some employers are providing benefits that go beyond the act,
such as extended paid sick time to care for family members.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, fully 25 percent of all American workers cared for
an ailing parent in 1996, according to the New York-based Families
and Work Institute. By 2002, 42 percent of all workers will provide
some form of elder care, ranging from helping a parent find housing
to paying bills or performing essential tasks such as providing
meals and personal care. And, although middle-aged workers are
still more likely to be engaged in elder care, one in five people
in their 20s and 30s cared for an elderly relative in the past
year.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is the trend more evident than in the workplace, where
employers are reporting that requests for time off to care for
aging and ailing parents are increasing. At State Street Corp., for
example, unpaid time off for elder care now accounts for 15 percent
of all leaves, up from 8 percent just two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Said Skip Schlenk, director of work and family programs at AT&AMP;T
Corp.: ``Elder care is becoming a big, big issue.''
</P>
<P>
   At BankBoston, 50 percent of the 63 extended family leaves
granted last year involved the care of an elderly relative. Workers
are permitted to use paid extended sick time (usually of two to
three weeks) to care for a family member. The bank also offers
assistance in finding nursing homes, medical care, or senior day
care.
</P>
<P>
   At AT&AMP;T, where elder care inquiries represent one-third of the
17,000 calls received by the firm's family resource and referral
program, workers telecommute, use personal days, vacation time, and
flexible scheduling to meet their parents' elder care needs.
</P>
<P>
   While Ryan has asked the city of Cambridge to review its stance
on converting paid sick time to paid leave for family illnesses,
personnel director Michael Gardner said it was unlikely the policy
would change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employees can use vacation time, plus any vacation time
(accumulated) from a prior year as well as compensatory time and
personal time for matters such as the care of a relative or family
member, and there also is flex time,'' Gardner said.
</P>
<P>
   Sociologists say the coming elder care explosion will have a
profound impact on working adults, one that will not only test
their emotional and physical stamina but also will likely serve as
a critical measurement of a company's commitment to employees.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Susan Kelley-Grasso, 42. When her mother became too ill
to live alone, she moved into her daughter's single-family home.
Kelley-Grasso relied solely on vacation and sick time when she
needed time off to provide care.
</P>
<P>
   A medical transcriptionist, Kelley-Grasso said being part of a
two-income household helped her meet financial costs. Still, those
months led to tensions on the job. ``I had assumed that because I
worked in a hospital people would understand what I was going
through,'' she said. But her managers didn't understand why her
mother, who was becoming increasingly confused and frail, could not
go to doctors' appointments alone. ``One day I thought I'd bring
her to the office just for a while in case the bus dropped her off
early (from a daycare center),'' said Kelley-Grasso. ``One manager
said, `No.' Then, the other manager said, `People usually ask about
taking their kids to work, but who would ever ask about bringing a
parent to work?' ''
</P>
<P>
   But some companies are helping their employees cope. Nationwide,
68 percent of all employers now offer flexible scheduling
arrangements, up from 53 percent in 1991, according to a 1996 study
by Hewitt Associates, a benefits consulting firm in Lincolnshire,
Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Muldoon, a senior consultant in BankBoston's work force
effectiveness unit, said the bank expanded its sick time policy
because it didn't want workers lying `` about why they were out or
saying they were sick when they were not. With this policy, they
can simply say my mother or father or child is sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Diane Piktialis, 53, a senior consultant at Ceridian Performance
Partners in Boston, relied on flexible scheduling and paid time off
last year to help her 88-year-old mother, who had cataracts
removed. Then, in October, her mother-in-law, who is 89, was
hospitalized after a fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working in an environment where you can leave when you have to
is incredibly helpful,'' she said. ``You don't have to worry about
being penalized.''
</P>
<P>
   After her father was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 1991,
Kathleen Duffus spent eight years caring for him. Almost overnight,
she became a caregiver while working full-time for a brokerage firm
and attending graduate school. ``So many things would come up
during the week,'' said Duffus, whose father died last year.
``There were emergencies and, for eight years, I saw to them. I
took a lot of time off from work.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Duffus was lucky: When her father was evicted from a
nursing home, she received three weeks' paid leave. ``If I had not
received paid leave, I wouldn't have been able to pay my bills,''
said Duffus, now 31 and director of finance for the Alzheimer's
Association of Massachusetts. ``If you are out of work for weeks
without pay, then, on top of all the other issues, you develop a
whole other problem on your hands.''
</P>
<P>
   During her tenure as a manager at Work Family Directions, a
benefits consulting firm in Brookline, Eleanor Chin could avail
herself of an array of work-family benefits, including paid time
off to care for both her elderly mother _ whose condition requires
doctor visits several times a week _ and her 11-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the sandwich generation, Chin didn't bother to
search for new work after she was laid off last year. Feeling that
few employers would be as flexible as her old boss, Chin launched a
consulting service from her home. ``I have definitely changed my
work so that I can meet my mother's needs and my daughter's
needs,'' she said. ``I've always tried to put myself in flexible
work situations,'' said Chin.
</P>
<P>
   Still, dissatisfaction with the benefits offered by US employers
has led some workplace advocates to push for laws that would offer
some pay to those who need time off to care for a parent. Most are
lobbying for temporary disability insurance that would cover elder
and child care and other wage replacement measures. So far only
five states offer temporary disability insurance that extends to
care of family members: New York, New Jersey, California, Rhode
Island, and Hawaii. These five states account for 22 percent of the
nation's private work force.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, five bills have been filed relating to paid
family leave, including two that would tap into the vast reserves
of the unemployment compensation fund to offer those who take leave
50 percent of their weekly wage.

SUMMIT RECOVERY PROVES WELCOME SIGHT FOR INVESTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We could hardly believe our eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Summit Technology Inc., the maker of vision-correcting lasers
flattened by self-inflicted disaster three years ago, has been
staging a furious stock rally to reclaim a good piece of its lost
value.
</P>
<P>
   Summit shares plunged from over 30 to below 4 in 1996 and stayed
in that neighborhood for more than two years. Suddenly, the story
changed and Summit stock has soared from 5 9/16 just six weeks ago
to 16 7/16 Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The sparks: improved performance benefiting from a hot market
and a promising turnaround plan, completion of an important
acquisition, and a broader following among investors.
</P>
<P>
   But what counts most is the rapidly growing popularity of the
medical procedure, available for several years, that uses lasers to
reshape a patient's cornea and improve or restore poor vision to
the point where eyeglasses and contact lenses are no longer needed.
The procedures, which are not covered by insurance, cost patients
about $2,000 per eye.
</P>
<P>
   Summit reports the number of procedures performed with its
lasers increased during the first quarter by 31 percent over the
previous three months and by 81 percent compared with the same
period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts at US Bancorp Piper Jaffray recently jacked up their
1999 estimates for all vision-correcting laser procedures to
865,511 from 755,464. They forecast the number will grow to 1.3
million next year.
</P>
<P>
   The good news: Summit and just one other laser company own
nearly all of the US market, and each one of them collects a fee of
about $250 per eye.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news: Summit, once the leader in its field, is now a
distant second. Competitor Visx Inc. controls about 75 percent of
the market, leaving less than 20 percent for Summit.
</P>
<P>
   Visx shareholders have made out better than anyone amid the
booming forecasts for procedure growth. Their stock has jumped from
21 last October to as high as 137 5/32. It closed Tuesday at 121
7/8.
</P>
<P>
   Summit may be behind now, but the outlook for the Waltham, Mass.
company was drastically worse two years ago. The company's business
practices, finances, and even technology came under fire as
Summit's shares plunged. Cofounder and chairman David Muller was
ousted by the board. A stolen US Food and Drug Administration
report on Visx that somehow made its way onto Muller's desk did not
help.
</P>
<P>
   There was another serious, longer term problem. Summit's
business strategy of operating 19 company vision centers, where
procedures were conducted, put the company at odds with the doctors
who were also its customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company had a very bad reputation with doctors,'' said
Robert Palmisano, a former Bausch &AMP; Lomb Inc. executive who became
Summit's chief executive in 1997. ``There were a variety of
reasons, not the least of which was going into competition with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Visx got an important upper hand by winning
more FDA approvals for specific laser procedures. Visx equipment
came to be seen as superior and could be used on more patients.
Summit was a wobbly number two, at best.
</P>
<P>
   Summit has since ditched the vision centers and Palmisano
organized a sales force that emphasizes medical support and
practice-building help for physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Prices of laser systems fell from about $500,000 to less than
$300,000. Both Summit and Visx saw the per-procedure fee as a
better way of making money. They pushed to get more equipment out
in the field or upgrade machines already in use.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like a razor-blade deal in that we were willing
to give up a lot of the profit on the equipment so that we can get
procedures done,'' said Palmisano.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Summit closed on its $46.8 million acquisition of
Autonomous Technologies Corp. that may give the company a leg up on
new laser technology. Meanwhile, FDA approval already in the works
for Summit to perform procedures on more patients will probably put
the company on equal regulatory footing with Visx before the end of
the summer.
</P>
<P>
   But business improvements aside, are Summit shares really worth
the prices they have reached in recent weeks? The stock now trades
at well over 100 times year 2000 earnings estimates by analysts who
like Summit.
</P>
<P>
   There are problems to boot: Summit's final turnaround isn't a
certainty and new competitors are sure to climb into the US market
eventually. Another sight-improving method that does not involve
lasers was approved by the FDA earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts who recommend Summit stock use the same line that
propels Internet issues: You can't use conventional methods to
value this investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really need to take a different approach,'' said analyst
Robert Faulkner of Hambrecht &AMP; Quist. ``I think you need to make an
assessment of what this technology is worth.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of that argument: measure Visx's stock value and
divide it by the firm's market share, then do the same thing for
Summit.
</P>
<P>
   The math will suggest Summit is trading at a 40 percent discount
to the Visx stock value. Faulkner and analyst Francesca Migliori of
US Bancorp Piper Jaffray say Visx stock deserves some premium, but
not that much.
</P>
<P>
   But what if Visx shares are overpriced? Using a stock that has
advanced sixfold in less than seven months is an aggressive
yardstick.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (Summit) business model itself is credible and
believable,'' said one analyst who declined to be identified.
``It's a matter of valuation. I'm thinking there might be some
takeover premium in the price of the stock.''

TRACY KIDDER FINDS INSPIRATION IN WESTERN MASSACHUSETTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ART ADV.: A photo is being sent to NYTNS clients. Non-subscribers
can make individual purchases by calling 212-556-4204 or -1927.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHAMPTON _ It's lunchtime at the Miss Florence Diner, and
Tracy Kidder heaves a happy sigh as he slides into a corner booth.
``This place at 4 a.m. is great,'' he announces. ``Of course, I
never would have come here at 4 o'clock in the morning before
working on this book.''
</P>
<P>
   He's referring to ``Home Town,'' his sixth book and something of
a departure for Kidder. Instead of the tightly defined narratives
that made him famous _ designing a computer in ``The Soul of a New
Machine'' (1981), say, or building a new home in ``House'' (1985) _
he presents a broad cross section of life as found in this small
Western Massachusetts city.
</P>
<P>
   Kidder, 53, became acquainted with the diner in its pre-dawn
incarnation during the course of many nights researching ``Home
Town'' in the company of Northampton police sergeant Tommy
O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   It's O'Connor who provides Kidder with his narrative spine.
(What doesn't a cop get to see in a small city?) He also
demonstrates Kidder's special knack for finding remarkable people
to write about. O'Connor more than holds his own in a lineup that
includes Tom West, the Zen-master computer guru of ``Soul''; the
perfectionist carpenters of ``House''; Chris Zajac, the devoted
schoolteacher of ``Among Schoolchildren'' (1989); and Lou and Joe,
the retirement-home roommates of ``Old Friends'' (1993).
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all O'Connor's star power, Kidder's real protagonist in
``Home Town'' is Northampton itself. And there's no better way to
see it than with a Kidder's-eye view from the passenger seat of his
Lexus sedan.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``These fields belong to the Smith Vocational Farm. Realtors
like to point out the cow herd. Yet we're within walking distance
of downtown. You know, it's almost like Northampton's a perfect
little kingdom. It's got its own hospital. It's got a county
courthouse. It's got a college. It's got its own little waterfront
down by the river. It's got its own little airport. It's like one
of those towns in a Hardy Boys mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Sociology is not what I'm out to write. I wanted to write
interesting stories,'' Kidder says of ``Home Town.'' ``Here's a
small town of just 30,000 people _ but it's as complicated as the
circuits of the human brain. I wanted to give some sense of the
complexity of it and the sort of delight in that complexity.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of that complexity is historical. Jonathan Edwards preached
in Northampton. Calvin Coolidge was mayor. Nancy Reagan and Barbara
Bush, as well as Betty Friedan and Sylvia Plath, attended Smith
College. The graham cracker and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
were invented here.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that complexity is social. Thanks to the presence of
Smith, Northampton's a classic New England college town: a citadel
of natural-fiber/NPR chic. There's a thriving arts community, and
designer coffee is easier to come by downtown than a wrench or
screwdriver. Not that Northampton lacks for buyers of wrenches and
screwdrivers. It has a long mill-town tradition, and there are
still working factories here. Noho (yuppie Northampton) and Hamp
(townie Northampton) peacefully coexist, but fault lines aren't
hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Smith kind of bleeds into the town. This is Paradise Pond. The
president's house is over there. This is quite a great school. It's
been harmed by its reputation as being almost entirely populated by
real, in-your-face lesbians. It's not true, but I don't think
they've dealt very well with it. The administration, I don't know,
there are ways in which what Smith does and does not spend money on
just astonishes me . . . Here are the Smith riding stables below
us. You talk about mixing of symbols of social class? We're about
90 seconds from the Grove Street Inn, the homeless shelter in the
book.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In ``House,'' Kidder describes a carpenter's surveying
instrument as ``a tool for imposing levelness on an irregular
world.'' He might just as well be talking about what he does in his
books. He brings literary order to the chaos of some small corner
of life, making of facts a kind of poetry of existence. Perhaps
only John McPhee, whom Kidder reveres, has a greater reputation as
a practitioner of nonfiction narrative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tracy Kidder is a great storyteller,'' says Northampton mayor
Mary Ford. She says this as one who has been on the receiving end
of his abilities (Ford makes several appearances in ``Home Town'').
``He certainly caught me at some moments I wish he hadn't caught
me,'' she says with a chuckle, ``but they're real, so I can't
quarrel.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people like to tell stories. Others like to listen to them.
Kidder is among the few equally good at both. He has a
sweet-natured, open manner that seems pleasingly at variance with
his big shoulders and loafy forearms. (Kidder and O'Connor got to
know each other through working out at the same gym.)
</P>
<P>
   He speaks in a slightly out-of-breath tenor, and the words come
in eager bursts. ``I have these very vivid memories of Tracy
bounding down the hill at the building site,'' recalls William
Rawn, the Boston architect who figures prominently in ``House,''
and ``to bound'' may be the key Tracy Kidder verb. Even when
seated, he gives the impression of generally being on the way from
Point A to Point B. ``I've always run around,'' he confesses,
``moving too fast from one thing to another.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Another item in the perfect little kingdom, it has its own
jail, with the prettiest view _ and the worst _ in the whole
county. Like a lot of things in Northampton, it's very desirable
(as jails go). The superintendent showed me the sheaf of letters he
gets every week from inmates throughout the state asking for a
transfer. Part of it was Northampton allowed smoking. Look at this
view: There's the Holyoke Range all before you, yet behind us is no
place you'd want to spend June _ and from in there you don't get
the view.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kidder lives in Williamsburg, a 20-minute drive from downtown
Northampton, with his wife, who's an artist. They have two
children: a son, who lives in San Francisco and works for a large
clothing firm; and a daugther, who's a junior at Brown. Kidder
comes into Northampton often, ``at least a couple of times a week,
and often more,'' to shop and run errands. He's come to cherish the
place, though he didn't always feel that way. ``I had a girlfriend
at Smith when I was in college _ and I couldn't wait to get out of
here. It seemed like such a dingy, dull town.''
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in Oyster Bay, N.Y., and part of his appreciation for
Northampton and environs stems from the fact that ``most of Long
Island has disappeared under a cloverleaf.'' Kidder graduated from
Harvard and then spent a year in Vietnam, as a lieutenant in Army
intelligence. ``There was combat all around us, but we weren't in
it,'' he says. ``I was a pretty bad soldier, to tell you the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon his return, Kidder wrote a novel ``about the experiences I
didn't have in Vietnam.'' It remains unpublished. He attended the
University of Iowa Writers' Workshop, where one of his teachers was
Atlantic Monthly contributing editor Dan Wakefield. Kidder began
writing for the magazine (he has himself been a contributing editor
since 1982). An assignment to cover the Juan Corona mass-murder
trial in California led to his first book, ``The Road to Yuba
City.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, in 1976, came the move to Williamsburg. ``We
were broke, basically, and trying to find a decent place to live.''
Kidder's credit rating significantly improved with the publication
of ``Soul.'' It became an enormous bestseller, won a Pulitzer
Prize, and remains Kidder's best-known book.
</P>
<P>
   The success of ``Soul'' not only eased Kidder's financial
concerns. It allowed him to stay close to home. The ``House''
carpenters are neighbors of his. ``Among Schoolchildren'' is set in
Holyoke, just down Interstate 91. Linda Manor, the ``Old Friends''
retirement home, is on the road from Williamsburg to downtown
Northampton. ``I'm making my own Yoknapatawpha County here,''
Kidder says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's downtown, with all these wonderful 19th-century
buildings: urban renewal just totally missed this place, thank God.
Yes, it looks boutiquey. A lot of coffee is sold, and what's sold
with that coffee is a beautiful downtown where people think they
used to live or would like to have lived. This place is packed with
people who want something you can't get in a mall. It's sort of a
mild freak show _ certainly mild compared to Berkeley, say. But
it's quite entertaining, and Northampton has a very lively night
life for a town its size.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The origins of ``Home Town'' lie in Haiti, which Kidder visited
in 1994 for The New Yorker. ``I just remember being there and
seeing a place where almost nothing worked. I started thinking
about how (Northampton) was a place that seemed to work very well
indeed, and I wondered why . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``But I was a little hesitant. First, I thought, what is there
really going to be to tell about a town that's so comely and
successful that won't be the standard historical-society sort of
thing? I was talking to O'Connor, and he said to me, `You don't
remember me, do you?' I said no, and he said that he'd stopped me
for speeding five years ago and given me a ticket. I did remember
it then. He'd said `Have a nice day,' and when he was done I wanted
to choke him! The reason I certainly remembered this was he stopped
my wife the same day and didn't give her a ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyway, he said `Why don't you come out riding with me in the
cruiser one night and I'll show you a Northampton you never knew
existed.' . . . I said sure, and he was as good as his word. It was
like some of the roofs came off: I suddenly saw a town that didn't
seem as simple, or as uniformly agreeable, as it had before.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor's an FBI agent now and lives in Washington, D.C. As for
Kidder, he's in no hurry to move from Yoknapatawpha North. ``There
have been times when I've thought I was bored with it and wanted to
live in someplace like New York or Boston or San Francisco, but
every time I go traveling and come back here I feel so relieved.''
For once, he's fully at rest, with not a hint of bounding. ``It's
been a nice place to live.''

RARE COPY OF US CONSTITUTION TO GO ON DISPLAY IN BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM F. DOHERTY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- After weeks of debating a draft of a new constitution,
delegates to the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia
appointed a committee on style to prepare a final version in
September 1787.
</P>
<P>
   Gouverneur Morris did most of the work and on Sept. 17, after
several more days of revision, it was adopted.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 500 copies of the final text had been secretly ordered
from a printer for distribution to the delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Today, only nine of those copies still exist. One of them will
be on display in the new federal courthouse in Boston for at least
the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   The rare copy of the final text is the only one that will be
readily accessible to the public. The eight others are in private
or public institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the copy being loaned to the Boston courthouse,
Doroth Tapper Goldman of New Canaan, Conn., said US Supreme Court
Justice Stephen G. Breyer, a friend and former federal appellate
judge in Boston, urged her to display the historic, six-page
document here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an admirable document that has enabled us to survive 200
years of differences in race, national origin, and religion,''
Breyer said in a rare phone interview from his chambers in the
Supreme Court. ``These differences are resolved in court, and I see
that, I see it, sitting on my bench because it is happening in
front of me every day.
</P>
<P>
   The precious document will be on exhibit beginning Sept. 17,
Constitution Day, in the second-floor rotunda of the courthouse on
Fan Pier. It will be the focus of an education program by the
Boston Bar Association and the Harvard Graduate School of
Education.
</P>
<P>
   US Court of Appeals Judge Sandra L. Lynch said the exhibit will
provide tourists, students and teachers an opportunity to read the
Constitution and then walk into any courtroom to see it in action.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can watch judges handle constitutional issues like the
right to a jury trial, habeas corpus, the commerce clause,'' said
Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch and Chief US District Judge William G. Young hope the
exhibit will make visitors more familiar with the structure of our
government and clear up ``fundamental misconceptions'' about how it
operates.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, she said, a recent poll shows that 39 percent of
the public erroneously believe a defendant has the burden of
proving his innocence in court.
</P>
<P>
   The copies printed for the delegates gave the general public the
first glimpse of the details of the proposed new government.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Leventhal, co-chairwoman of the Boston Bar Association's
Constitution project, said an allotment of copies was given to each
of the 55 convention delegates to take home, circulate among
friends and colleagues, debate, reprint and read aloud.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was used for teaching then, and we are going to use it
again to teach,'' Leventhal said.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1787, Leventhal said Benjamin Franklin ordered extra
copies sent to Massachusetts because of the strong initial
resistance to the Constitution here _ a position based on the lack
of a bill of rights, which was not adopted until later.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Constitution, which predates the federal
version, begins with its own Declaration of Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Jacob Shallus' famous handwritten signed parchment of the
US Constitution on display at the National Archives in Washington,
the copies were printed on cotton pages, which are more durable,
Leventhal said.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman's copy was purchased by her late husband, New York real
estate developer S. Howard Goldman, for $175,000 at a Sotheby's
auction in 1988. She said she has traced it back through private
hands about 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want younger adults and older adults to have an authentic
experience with an original document,'' said Goldman, a Tufts
graduate who lived in the Boston area for 29 years. ``I find it
very exciting every time I look at it. Perhaps it was one of the
copies that was read in front of Independence Hall.''
</P>
<P>
   Breyer's ties to Boston go back to 1961 as a law student at
Harvard University and later as a Harvard professor. He sat on the
federal Appeals Court in Boston for 13 years until being named to
the Supreme Court in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   As the former chief judge of the US Court of Appeals for the
First Circuit, Breyer was instrumental in developing a new federal
courthouse for Boston. By his own account, he became obsessed with
making it ``perfect'' and was intimately involved with every detail
of its conception and construction.
</P>
<P>
   Breyer, 60, who jokes that he is just now beginning to feel like
a full-fledged Bostonian after all these years, says the city
steeped in the founding of this country is the perfect home for the
document.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston is the place that for 200 years has itself embodied
these ideas,'' Breyer says. ``It is the city on the hill, it looks
out toward the seas, it has always had a history.''

SALB KEEPS HER SHOTS ON TRACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Amanda Salb heads to Williams College for the ECAC track
and field championships this weekend, she will take with her the
longest throw in the nation (45 feet, 3 3/4 inches) this season for
Division III shot put. She will take with her the 1998 Div. III
national championship. She will take with her the New England Div.
III championship she won last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   What the Mount Holyoke senior won't take with her, said coach
Tina Lee, is an ego.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a very humble woman,'' said Lee. ``That's part of what
makes her so good to be around.''
</P>
<P>
   Some might say the 21-year-old Salb, from rural Arkansas, was
born to be great. Her father, after all, is Karl Salb, a six-time
NCAA champion shot-putter for the University of Kansas in the late
1960s and early '70s. Her mother, Jessie, threw the shot, too, in
college: that's how her parents met. But mostly, said Lee, Salb is
good because ``she's very hungry, not to be a national champion but
to do her best.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the first Mount Holyoke woman ever to win an
individual NCAA Div. III championship was hardly determined to
compete for the Lyons. When she was still in high school and got
the first brochure in the mail, her reaction was, ``It's a women's
college! Omigod! And I threw it away. But the second or third one I
got, I started to look at it.'' After Salb and her mother drove up
to see the campus and she learned the school had a strong program
in biology, she was hooked.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, Salb is set to get her degree on May 23, the
day after she gets back from defending her NCAA shot put title at
the national championships in Berea, Ohio. She will leave South
Hadley not only as an All-American in track and field, but also as
the school's all-time leader in rebounds and steals in basketball,
where she played center/forward. After graduation, she will head to
an internship at the Wildlife Center of Virginia, where she will
spend the summer as an animal caretaker before going on to
veterinary school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't really thought about it,'' said Salb, when asked if
she would continue with track and field after graduation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, definitely,'' said her coach, when asked if Salb had the
talent to compete nationally at the post-collegiate level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides being very strong, there's her speed,'' said Lee.
``She has that internal fire that a coach can't dictate, can't
measure. That's what made her get to where she is.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wanted: volunteers
</P>
<P>
   The folks organizing the Women's World Cup in Foxborough are
looking for volunteers. Drivers (you must be at least 21),
ambassadors, and other helpers minimum age: 14) are needed. Games
will be played at Foxboro Stadium on June 20 and 27 and July 4. For
an application, call Don Mauch, the venue staffing manager, at
508-384-9217. Although 60,000 tickets have already been sold for
the five games to be played at Foxboro, seats still remain. Call
800-WWC-TIKS for individual tickets, 877-GET-REVS for groups of 30
or more or for more information.

<P>
   Mad Dog goes coed
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Mad Dogs professional baseball team is adding
a woman to its roster. The Mad Dogs, based in Lynn, have signed
Tammy Holmes an outfielder who played with the now defunct Colorado
Silver Bullets. Holmes, who led the team in batting average (.341)
and RBIs (42), was on the volleyball team at the University of
California at Davis, and was trying to earn a spot in the ABL
before it folded. The Mad Dogs open their fourth season on May 28
at Fraser Field in Lynn against the Allentown (Pa.) Ambassadors . .
. Ireland's Catherina McKiernan plans to make her American marathon
debut at the LaSalle Banks Chicago Marathon on Oct. 24. It will be
her fourth marathon, after winning her first three. McKiernan's
personal-best time is 2 hours, 22 minutes, and 23 seconds, the
seventh-fastest in history . . . Sarah Russell, the Harvard
basketball standout who also founded a community service program
for varsity athletes, was recently named winner of the Harvard
College Women's Leadership Award.

OFFERING UP TOP-DRAWER MUSINGS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Emptying Out The Desk Drawer of the Sports Mind . . .
</P>
<P>
   What's Wrong With Sports Dept.: You know and I know that there
isn't one kid among the top 100 high school basketball players who
would list Joe Dumars among his top five favorite players, and yet
there isn't a single player in the NBA more worthy of emulation,
both on and off the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The ever-astute Elaine Ryan says they should not have bothered
to play an NBA season, and she happens to be 100 percent correct.
</P>
<P>
   If I ran a club on Lansdowne Street, I'd try to hire that Cuban
second base umpire as my chief bouncer, pronto.
</P>
<P>
   Junior Griffey's gonna hit 60, and it will be like being the
third man on the moon. But whether he hits 50, 55, or 60, he is the
best player in the game; you know.
</P>
<P>
   Yo, Drew: Larry mangled his index finger even worse before he
played a day of pro ball, and he did reasonably OK. You can just
forget that second career as a hand model.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Clemens may have set himself up to be bashed a bit by the
many contradictory things he has said, but wasn't a big issue in
the Joe Morgan era the fact that Clemens was regularly throwing
130-140 pitches a game and refusing to come out?
</P>
<P>
   If Lamar Odom doesn't come out, stop worrying about Cleveland
having Rick Pitino's No. 1 pick. There's nobody else worth crying
about.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL should have gone to two referees 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   When the NBA playoffs come, underestimate San Antonio, and
especially the better-than-you-think Avery Johnson, at your peril.
</P>
<P>
   The real story coming out of the Patriots stadium saga is that
it underscores the truly pathetic way our commonwealth does
business. I say this just in case you missed Joan Vennochi's
brilliant take on the matter on Tuesday's op-ed page.
</P>
<P>
   If you'd like a textbook example of Yankee imperialism, take a
look at what we've done to the helpless Canadian cities trying to
compete in their sport.
</P>
<P>
   No one ever had a better day than the late Joe Adcock did on
July 31, 1954, in Ebbets Field: 18 total bases via four home runs
and a line-drive double that missed going out by a foot. He also
was the first man to plant one in the Polo Grounds bleachers. Had
to be the best player ever to come out of Coushatta, La.
</P>
<P>
   He may have started his dominance a tad too late, but if he
keeps doing what he's been doing for four or five more years (he's
33), Craig Biggio could be in the midst of a Hall of Fame career.
Betcha didn't know he's averaged 126 runs a year since '95 (to go
with 88 in strike-shortened '94).
</P>
<P>
   Someone who just came back from hanging out with the Cubs tells
me Sammy Sosa is muy gordo. You know, one too many cheese
enchiladas during the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   This just in. Mike Ditka has finalized his personal services
arrangement with Ricky Williams. Mon. _ Drives kid to work. Tue.
(the standard day off) _ Mows lawn. Wed. _ Shines shoes. Thu. _
Does the marketing. Fri. _ Cleans the house. Sat. _ Answers
correspondence. Sun. _ Gives ball 35 times.
</P>
<P>
   Win or lose, I can see Larry Bird returning to civilian life
next year. And Kevin McHale makes two.
</P>
<P>
   Our dour GM was right. Jose Offerman most certainly has replaced
Mo's on-base capability. Now, Duke, about Part B . . .
</P>
<P>
   The ever-charming Albert Belle showed his disdain for Peter
Angelos's attempt at international diplomacy by watching 11
straight pitches go by in successive ABs, being called out on
strikes each time.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Melrose, Barry Melrose, where is your hair?
</P>
<P>
   OK, Messrs. Jacobs and Krezwick: It's Year 4 of the Fleet and
we're still waiting for some photos and murals and, you know, stuff
on the walls to let people know they're in the home of the 16-time
world champion Celtics and a Bruins franchise that has given us
Shore, Schmidt, and Orr. Oh, I forgot. The good stuff's all in
``Legends,'' isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   No one ever has worn the backup QB mantle more comfortably than
Scott Zolak.
</P>
<P>
   Bruins fans, just what you don't want to hear: The Great Gretzky
says he hated Ulf Samuelsson when he played against him, but that
the chippy Swede turned out to be ``the best teammate I ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   A Dumars addendum: A big issue in his draft ('85) was which one
of four perceived equal guard prospects did you like between 15 and
25. Dumars went 18th to Detroit. The others? Steve Harris (19th,
Houston), Terry Porter (24th, Portland), and Sam Vincent (20th,
Boston). Two big hits, two bad misses. Never doubt that the entire
enterprise is anything other than an inexact science.
</P>
<P>
   When Duke starts losing 'em early to the NBA draft, college
basketball as we know it is over.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know who the best quarterback of all-time was, but I
don't get this full-fledged Joe Montana adulation, when it was
quite clear he was a ``system'' quarterback, and neither a Dan
Marino pure passer nor a John Elway athlete. Out of context, there
are plenty of guys I'd take over Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks, Mr. King. You couldn't have called the book, ``The Girl
Who Loved Mariano Rivera,'' could you?
</P>
<P>
   Cal Ripken says he's baffled by the public's desire for input on
his ``private'' decision to retire or not to retire, but he wasn't
objecting when that same public rallied to his cause at various
contract times, did he? For what it's worth, Cal, people would
rather not see you looking old and feeble.
</P>
<P>
   My solution to this Kosovo mess: lock Pat Burns in a room with
Slobodan Milosevic.

GRIZZLY VETERAN HELPS YOUNG BRUINS BEARD PLAYOFF FOES

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- They are a Gillette salesman's dream. They are
two-blade, three-blade, four-blade tough. They are enough to make
the director of razor blade engineering call in Edward Scissorhands
for a secret consultation.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have made it through the first round of the playoffs
and victory is written all over their faces, in the form of beards,
goatees, mustaches, and some unreasonable facsimiles. They are in
character, playoff face, maintaining the tradition that says real
men don't shave when it comes time to chase the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not like Grizzly Adams over there,'' said Kyle McLaren,
comparing his sparse beard to the thick blanket that covers Ray
Bourque's face. ``It's just tradition. Playoff beards . . . or, for
some of us, facial hair.''
</P>
<P>
   P.J. Axelsson is among the follicly challenged, the
beard-impaired. The 24-year-old Swede has joined this hair club for
men, but it takes a close look to make sure he hasn't had a close
shave.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fun thing,'' said Axelsson, adding that the same
tradition lives on in Europe, too, when elite teams enter the
playoffs. ``There's nothing wrong with it, but I don't think I'll
keep it when I'm finished.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Bourque's 20th season, his 19th playoff tour. The Round
1 clincher over Carolina Sunday night was his 174th postseason
game. He has grown playoff beards short and long, the Bruins making
it to the Cup finals twice in his tenure, which makes him somewhat
of an expert on this, shall we say, growth industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some days I like the idea, some days I don't,'' he said,
following Tuesday's workout here. ``I'm always thinking, `OK, do I
shave it after every series? What should I do here, trim it, carve
it, what?' I think I'm going to be trimming it.''
</P>
<P>
   He is now 38 years old, and splashes of gray dapple Bourque's
springtime beard. Silver circles the size of half-dollars have
sprouted up halfway down his cheeks. His chin is flecked with
silver. The baby-faced kid who arrived here in '79 may play like a
teen-ager, but his playoff beard tells the undeniable truth, that
age catches up to all of us.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Bourque has carried a photographic image in his
head, a snapshot of what he would look like if his Bruins won the
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   He would be holding it. Click.
</P>
<P>
   He would be hugging it. Click.
</P>
<P>
   He would lifting it high, passing it to teammates, shaking it
madly. Click. Click. Click.
</P>
<P>
   And his cheeks, said Bourque, would be sunken. The picture
wouldn't hide that. The beard wouldn't disguise it. To win 16 games
across April and May and June would leave a man looking emaciated,
battle-worn, the Cup a true testimony to the pound(s) of flesh it
extracted.
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday morning, a quarter of that photo has developed.
The Bruins need 12 more victories to land their first Cup since
1972. Bourque's chances of seeing that mental image someday being
portrayed in print or on video have dwindled. He has this playoff
season, maybe another, but maybe not. Maybe this is all there is.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque looks around the dressing room now and sees kids like
Hal Gill, Anson Carter, Sergei Samsonov, and refers to the Bruins
as ``their team.'' He doesn't have to look in the mirror and see
Father Time's silver thumbprints to know the future. Time is
passing. So, too, is the torch.
</P>
<P>
   In all the jubilation Sunday night, in the moments immediately
following the series triumph over Carolina, some subtle but telling
humor played out on the ice. The kids in the Black 'n' Gold
uniforms didn't know what to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bunch of us went over and said our piece to (Byron Dafoe),''
recalled Gill, now finishing up only his second season. ``You know,
we said the usual stuff, `Hey, great job, great job, how to go.'
Then a bunch of us just stood there and looked at each other and
wondered, `OK, what do we do now? Do we shake hands? Do we go back
to the bench? Do we leave?' ''
</P>
<P>
   After two decades, Bourque knows the end-of-series drill. He was
the one who finally commandeered the kids and moved them through
the line, the way an uncle would nudge a niece or nephew through a
wedding reception.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was funny,'' recalled Bourque. ``They were just standing
there and I'm like, `It's all right, guys, go shake hands now.'
You've got the Carolina guys out there at center ice, just
standing, and nothing's happening, and you could tell they were
thinking, `Uh, you know, we'd like to get out of here.' Hey's it's
the first time for a lot of our guys. They don't know, they have to
learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that they know, now that they've got some idea of how good
playing hockey can feel this late into the season, Bourque the good
shepherd wants them to let the feeling go, grow with it. In '88 and
'90, it led to trips to the finals. Those were the days when the
Bruins were postseason shoo-ins and strong playoff runs, though by
no means absolute, weren't unexpected. No one stood around when a
series was won and looked to the captain for a primer on victor's
etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   ``This next series, they'll know,'' said Bourque. ``That's the
best part about this right now: When you find out how good it is to
win, how great it feels, you miss it if you're not in it. You win
and you realize the urgency of it. It's why you're here. You
realize the importance of making it happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``But guys have to taste that to know it. It's why it was so
important for us to win a series like that. Last year, we played
great in that series against Washington, but we had nothing to show
for it. They found out then that close isn't good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's opening series provided hints that something good
could happen, perhaps sooner rather than later. The Bruins will
face a better goaltender in the next series, and a more refined
offense, but Bourque hopes his young, emerging teammates, the
future stars of the team, don't sit back now and think that their
true chance to win will come in some later Thursday. They're here,
they're in it, and the last five years serve as proof that there
are only so many opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all the ups and downs, the grinding, that make you grow,
that make you better,'' said the captain. ``This is their team.
There are a lot of young guys here, key guys, who are going to make
up this team for a lot of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Round 2 is about to begin. The Bruins finished off the
Hurricanes with three straight victories, the first time they've
won three in a row in a series since polishing off the Canadiens in
the second round in '92.
</P>
<P>
   The kids are coming into their own. Their goalie is a sure
thing. Can they be considered a favorite in any series the rest of
the way? Probably not.
</P>
<P>
   But the oldest, wisest, and grayest beard among them doesn't
believe .
</P>
<P>
   ``I want them to realize that it is their team now,'' said
Bourque. ``and that they don't have to wait a couple of years to
make something out of this.''

   Her mother's recipes turned out to be notes. She used coffee
cups and soupspoons to measure ingredients. ``The hardest part was
getting her recipes to come out the way she made them,'' says
Sullivan. Her mother used a 2-pound container of ricotta for her
ricotta pie. The original instructions said something like: ``Add
as much flour as it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, she says, ``I made Easter bread about 50 times
before I got it right.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the recipes Ferri had learned from her Roman
sisters-in-law evolved into easier dishes, a change reflected in
the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``She worked,'' says Sullivan. ``You take many shortcuts when
you start working.'' A pasta e fagioli, for instance, the pasta and
bean dish, is made with canned beans and canned tomato sauce. ``If
she had leftover tomato sauce, she would use it,'' says Sullivan,
``but if she didn't, well, off to the supermarket.''
</P>
<P>
   On holidays, there might be 20 people around the table. A
typical Sunday dinner table would be laid end to end with pork
roast or chicken, broccoli rabe, stuffed peppers, eggplant
Parmesan, artichokes, and pasta. Ferri was famous for her ricotta
gnocchi and spinach ravioli.
</P>
<P>
   She stayed close to her sisters-in-law. For holiday meals, they
cooked together and each also made more food at home.
</P>
<P>
   Ferri's pizzelle, of course, were always on the menu. And she
still seems to run a private bakery. A granddaughter visits and
goes home with a tin. So does anyone from out of town. She gives
pizzelle to a friend who drives her somewhere. The neighbor who
shovels her front walk finds a batch on his doorstep later that
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``A friend calls at 7 a.m.,'' says Ferri. ``I make three-egg
pizzelle. I'm done by 7:30.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know, Ma. You make the best pizzelle anywhere.''
</P>
<P>

JENNIE FERRI'S PIZZELLE
</P>
<P>
   6 eggs
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 2/3 sticks margarine, melted
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons vanilla
</P>
<P>
   3 cups flour
</P>
<P>
   4 teaspoons baking powder
</P>
<P>
   In a medium bowl, beat the eggs and sugar. Add the melted
margarine (which is cool but not hard). Add the vanilla. Sift
together the flour and baking powder, and add to the egg mixture,
stirring until fully absorbed.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the pizzelle iron until hot (approximately 15 minutes). If
the iron is not hot enough, the dough will stick. Drop a small ball
of dough into the center of the iron. Close the lid and wait about
20 seconds. The dough should be cooked and golden brown when the
lid is lifted. Remove from the grid.
</P>
<P>
   Drop a scant tablespoon in the center of the grid for each
pizzelle. Each one should take approximately 45 seconds to cook.
(You may need to experiment with your particular pizzelle machine
to get the right length of time for each one). Store in an airtight
container to keep crisp.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL; 
RISOTTO
</P>
<P>
   Unlike northern Italian risotto seen on menus now, this southern
version is a layered dish in which rice, tomato sauce, tiny
meatballs, and cheese are baked together. It hardly requires any
attention from the cook. ``This is the way my aunts taught my
mother to do it,'' says Vilma Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2 cups rice, uncooked
</P>
<P>
   2 cups (approximately) tomato sauce
</P>
<P>
   2 cups tiny meatballs (see recipe below)
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces scamorza or mozzarella cheese, shredded or thinly
sliced
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup grated Romano or Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   Boil 5 cups of water. Add the rice and cook until all the water
is absorbed, about 25 to 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In a large casserole, pour about 1/2 cup of the tomato sauce and
spread to cover the base of the dish. Pour in a third of the rice.
Spread the tiny meatballs and mozzarella over the rice and add more
sauce. Sprinkle a third of the grated Romano on top. Layer the rice
and other ingredients until all are in the casserole, ending with
the spaghetti sauce and cheeses.
</P>
<P>
   Place in a 350-degree oven for 30 minutes or until the cheese
melts.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL; 
TINY MEATBALLS
</P>
<P>
   1 pound lean ground beef
</P>
<P>
   1 egg
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup Italian bread crumbs
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon grated Romano cheese
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon fresh minced parsley
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Salt (optional)
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup olive oil for frying
</P>
<P>
   Place the ground beef in a medium bowl. Add the remaining
ingredients and mix well. Roll into tiny balls about 1/2 inch in
diameter _ approximately 1/2 teaspoon of the mixture. (Wetting your
hands with water will help to keep the mixture from clinging to
your skin.) Fry in olive oil over medium heat, browning all sides.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 35 to 40 meatballs.

   SOMERVILLE, Mass. _ The pizzelle irons are wrapped in crinkly
plastic supermarket bags and stored in the back pantry. There are
several of them, but Giovanna ``Jennie'' Loverro Ferri, age 99,
really likes only one, and that's the iron her daughter pulls out
and unwraps. It's about 30 years old and has been repaired many
times. Once, when her daughter took it to Cross Hardware in the
North End to get it fixed, the store etched her name and the date
(1971) on the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Ferri has already made the batter for the pizzelle
(peat-ZEL-le), a crisp Italian pastry. She used three eggs. ``My
mother doesn't use recipes,'' says Vilma Sullivan. ``She goes by
the number of eggs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Six eggs?'' Ferri had asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, Ma, three's enough,'' answered Sullivan. Six eggs would
have produced so many thin, sugary, vanilla-scented rounds, they
could have served
</P>
<P>
   NANA, Page E4 &QL; 
most of their Somerville neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Jennie Ferri returned the six-egg bowl to its hook in the pantry
and pulled off the three-egg bowl. In loafers and sweat pants, her
cane propped on the back of a chair, she began a pizzelle lesson
that she could probably give in her sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Ferri will turn 100 on June 24, and since her retirement in the
late '60s from her job as a raincoat stitcher for Byron Clothing in
Davis Square, Ferri has baked almost every single day. She shares a
two-family house with her daughter Vilma and son-in-law Eugene
Sullivan. She has poor hearing and macular degeneration, and she
has suffered from arthritis in her back and legs since the age of
40. But she's agile enough to stand and cook for hours. For Easter,
she made ricotta pie, lasagna, and of course pizzelle. Two weeks
ago, it was a pot of chicken soup. Last week, she made her famous
gnocchi.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't cook much this winter, because she fell in Florida in
February and her leg was too swollen to stand on. But all the
health aides and nurses are gone now, and she has resumed normal
life.
</P>
<P>
   Afternoons are reserved for Oprah. Mornings she bakes.
</P>
<P>
   Vilma Sullivan is the assistant. ``I need the egg beater,'' says
Ferri.
</P>
<P>
   ``The egg beater or the mixer, Ma?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Egg beater.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This, Ma?'' asks Sullivan. She holds up the mixer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You said the egg beater.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferri shrugs. She breaks the eggs against each other to crack
them into the bowl. Next she pours in a melted stick of Promise
margarine from another bowl.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the margarine bowl is empty, Ferri moves it to the
far corner of the table. Sullivan whisks it away. ``She is Mrs.
Clean,'' Sullivan whispers.
</P>
<P>
   Ferri adds 3/4 cup of sugar to the bowl, then uses the electric
mixer to beat the mixture until it is thick and smooth. She
measures 1 1/2 cups of flour and sifts it into another bowl, then
beats it in with 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. The mixture is
about the consistency of pancake batter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the eggs are too small,'' she says, ``you put in a little
more flour.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ma, you didn't make these in Italy, right?'' Sullivan
practically has to shout. Her mother can't wear a hearing aid
because of tinnitus, a form of nerve damage that causes ringing in
her ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never made pizzelle in Italy,'' Ferri says.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father's family came from Rome,'' explains Sullivan, ``and
my mother's siblings did not live here then.'' So she learned to
cook from her husband's sisters, who lived near her in Gardner.
``She doesn't cook like a Barese,'' says Sullivan. ``She cooks more
like a Roman. The food is worlds apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennie Ferri was born in 1900 in Cassano Murge in the province
of Bari, near the ankle of the boot-shaped Italy, a region
surrounded by mountains. She was the third of seven children born
to a coppersmith who had a little shop in the town of 7,000
inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   Her father decided to bring his family to America and left
before them to get settled. During his absence, the children were
playing where they shouldn't have been and there was an accident
that changed everything. ``It was in a building across the
street,'' explains Ferri. ``Someplace where you washed clothes.
They put lye in the clothing. My sister reached over the basin and
it blew up and blinded her. She was 8 or 9 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   So their father returned to Italy and stayed there, Ferri says,
because US Immigration wouldn't accept her sister and he wouldn't
leave her behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always with my father,'' says Ferri.
</P>
<P>
   ``She means she was her father's favorite,'' explains Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   When Ferri was 19, she asked her father if she could go to
America. ``He said no.''
</P>
<P>
   She went anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Giovanna Loverro married Umberto ``Albert'' Ferri in 1923, and
they had two daughters, Vilma and Anna. Before the girls were born,
the couple took in Jennie's brother Joseph's children, Tina and
Felix, who had nowhere to go when their father divorced their
mother.
</P>
<P>
   Two of her sisters also came here, Anna and Domenica (who will
turn 90 this summer), as well as another brother, Santo. Grazielle,
the sister who was blinded by the accident, regained partial sight
but never left Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Ferri died in 1982 after a long bout with Parkinson's
disease. Jennie Ferri's daughter Anna Viglione lives in Florida
with her husband, Salvatore. They have three children: Joseph in
Woburn, Gail in East Bridgewater, and Steven in Boston. Vilma's
son, Eugene Jr., lives in Medford.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Viglione is a producer of Video Radio. A tape he made
that shows his grandmother cooking doughnuts, chocolate chip
cookies, and pizzelle has run on several local cable networks.
</P>
<P>
   Jennie Ferri also has her own cookbook.
</P>
<P>
   When she turned 95, her family threw a huge birthday party. As a
souvenir, Sullivan, who is a senior editor in the publications
department of Tufts University, took all of her mother's
handwritten recipes and turned them into a spiral-bound book. On
the cover, Jennie Ferri as a very young woman stands beside her
younger sister Domenica.
</P>
<P>
   In an introduction to the book, Sullivan contrasts life then and
now. ``There were no electric mixers, blenders, pasta machines,
bread mixers with kneading capabilities, and ravioli makers in my
mother's early years,'' she writes. ``All doughs were kneaded by
hand (giving the arms great muscle tone _ no weight lifting
needed).''
</P>
<P>
   Ferri used a 2-foot-long rolling pin, called a ``stenamassa,''
Sullivan writes, to roll out pasta, pie crusts, and doughnuts.
``Noodles were created from pasta dough by rolling the dough out
over a `chitarra,' a contraption that resembled a small portable
hand-weaving loom framed in wood,'' which sliced the dough. The
stenamassa was then balanced on the arms of two chairs to serve as
a drying rack.

DAFOE GETS SOMETHING FOR NOTHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN VELLANTE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- He wanted, more than anything else, to experience the
thrill of playoff victory. He had already tasted the agony of
playoff defeat.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to feel what his captain, Ray Bourque, told him would
be something very, very special.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't care whether it took four games or seven. He didn't
care whether he rang up a shutout or let a few get by him. He just
wanted to win.
</P>
<P>
   And now that Bruins goalie Byron Dafoe has one notch in his
belt, he wants another. He, and his teammates, have become, in the
words of coach Pat Burns, ``greedy right now.''
</P>
<P>
   And why shouldn't they be?
</P>
<P>
   Their confidence level is off the chart and they have a goalie
who's hungry and unquestionably playing the best hockey of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Dafoe was pretty lucky in Sunday's series-clinching 2-0
win over Carolina, with the Hurricanes missing four open-net
chances, but he was good when he had to be. A 31-save shutout
night, regardless of how it comes about, is a 31-save shutout
night.
</P>
<P>
   It was Dafoe's second shutout of the series and third of his
playoff career. In the six-game set with Carolina, he stopped 154
of 164 scoring bids (.939 save percentage) and posted an
eye-popping 1.46 goals against average. With those kinds of
figures, it's no wonder the Bruins are thinking big.
</P>
<P>
   ``The confidence that builds in this room, you know, the further
we go, the better it gets,'' said Dafoe. ``We're a pretty confident
bunch of guys right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``You win the first round, and sometimes they say that's the
hardest round, just to get out of it, and after that, who knows
what can happen? We're just going to go out and have fun and try
and win another one.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe acknowledged that he and the Bruins were very fortunate
Sunday that they weren't blown out of the Vault in the second
period, when Carolina outshot them, 16-3, and missed what 'Canes
coach Paul Maurice said were ``four gimme putts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They definitely came hard and I was fortunate,'' said Dafoe.
``I made some saves when I had to, but I also had a couple of empty
nets and they put some plexiglass up or something. I don't know
what happened, but obviously with them not getting a goal and us
taking a 2-0 lead going into the third, I like our chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kind of realized we got away with something there and
weren't going to let it happen again in the third period, and
that's exactly what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins tightened things up considerably in the final 20
minutes and allowed Carolina just four shots on Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt for the first time in six games he gave up some big
rebounds,'' said Carolina's Keith Primeau. ``I can't even count the
number of solid chances we had. I don't know if we have any more
chances in this locker room. But he turned us down time and time
again. It was just that Byron Dafoe played out of his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Solid, yes, but ``out of his mind'' may be a stretch. After all,
Dafoe came into the series with 32 wins, a 1.99 goals against
average and an NHL-high 10 shutouts. Those were figures he was
delighted with, but . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been saying all along I was looking for the playoffs,''
said Dafoe. ``I've never done anything on my own in the playoffs as
a starting goaltender and this is the year I want to go somewhere.
I want to do something and I feel that we have the type of team
that can beat anyone in this league on any given night.''
</P>
<P>
   When the final horn sounded, Dafoe and his mates congratulated
each other, then went through the Stanley Cup ritual of exchanging
handshakes with their opponents. When Dafoe met Arturs Irbe, the
two embraced and swapped pleasantries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arturs told me, `Great series,' and said, `Go out and prove
them wrong,' '' said Dafoe. ``I have a feeling he was kind of
talking about the All-Star snubbing and stuff like that. Very nice
words from him.''
</P>
<P>

against Carolina _ and won the series in six games. Here's how

DOOM, RHETORIC AT THE CLICK OF A MOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ So this was the heart of darkness of the culture
of carnage. I was playing Eric Harris' version of Doom II, called
U.A.C. Labs, which he put on his Web site three years ago with a
big ``Whatsup all you doomers out there!''
</P>
<P>
   OK, I couldn't even get near the heart of darkness. The first
time I tried to fight my way into the spaceport occupied by zombie
warriors I was shot down after only getting around two corners of
the maze.
</P>
<P>
   I did have the satisfaction of seeing two zombies blown to bits
in the sights of my semiautomatic pistol. They made wheezy
electronic ``ughs'' and their heads flew into red electronic
chunks.
</P>
<P>
   Realistic? Maybe if you're a kid out of touch with reality.
</P>
<P>
   In Harris' version of the game, you don't have to stop to pick
up as many new clips of ammo. You can just keep firing.
</P>
<P>
   That feature came in handy for me. My most violent previous
video game was Ms. Pac-Man. The only one I was any good at was
Pong.
</P>
<P>
   One very unrealistic thing about Doom II: You get to reincarnate
yourself every time you're killed.
</P>
<P>
   I came back a couple of times, shooting my way through
zombie-infested mazes until I found a sawed-off shotgun, a weapon
chosen by Harris and his friend Dylan Klebold to massacre fellow
students at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   The Doom II manual says: ``Combat shotguns are double-barreled,
sawed-off killing sticks.''
</P>
<P>
   There I was looking down the sawed-off barrels of the killing
stick in Harris' version of Doom II. I kept thinking about school
hallways and forgot the maze. The barrels flew in the air in
recoil, but a demon destroyed me because I was too shook to get the
gun on target.
</P>
<P>
   I had been told that Doom II was brutally realistic. Instead, I
found it unrealistic, repetitive and a waste of time _ after the
initial rush of trying to shoot monsters shooting at me.
</P>
<P>
   The scary part was playing Harris' personally designed version
of Doom II and running around a building with a double-barreled,
sawed-off killing stick.
</P>
<P>
   The game wasn't upsetting. Reality was _ the reality that came
three years after Harris programmed the difficulty level of his
version as ``Well, just stick with ultra violence.''
</P>
<P>
   I'd say the makers of Doom and other video games are in trouble,
just on the basis of that one comment in the manual about
``double-barreled, sawed-off killing sticks.'' Here's what kind of
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they continue to market death and degradation to our
children _ and pay no heed to the carnage _ then one way or
another, the government will act,'' said Sen. Joseph Lieberman,
D-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   He said that goes for the Hollywood branch of the culture of
carnage, too. But Hollywood is the culture of Clinton, so who
knows?
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, told a Senate hearing Tuesday that the
government should borrow tactics from the attack on the tobacco
industry to take on Hollywood and the video game industry. He said
the government should examine marketing practices, which are
clearly targeting teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take any research. Who goes to movies? Who plays
video games? Just look at the Doom II box, with its futuristic,
shotgun-armed trooper.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there is a parental warning in case they miss the monster
and guns. It says, ``Violence: blood and gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the little symbol for violence is an anarchist's bomb
with a lighted fuse, the kind depicted in Mighty Mouse cartoons
decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   So here's my problem with Doom II, besides the fact that I had
to run around corridors with an electronic version of Harris'
sawed-off shotgun. It's tedious. Only a kid who's twisted to begin
with could model the end of his life, and the end of a lot of
lives, on such silly crap.
</P>
<P>
   When Harris posted his version of Doom II, he warned people not
to change anything. ``If you do, I will blow you up,'' he wrote.
``And it will not be cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Was that just a teen-ager talking, or was it a warning clearly
seen in retrospect?
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? Our lawmakers certainly act like they do. Lawmakers
have to pass laws, so they've sprung into action. They're off on
one of their periodic scapegoat hunts. A very bad, inexplicable
event is leading to some bad, useless proposals.
</P>
<P>
   After a few minutes of shooting zombies in Doom II, I realized
that millions of kids had played this game and hadn't gone on to
real carnage. Most kids are smart enough to know what's real. The
kids that don't are in more trouble than a video game could cause.

LET THE SUN SHINE ON DEATH ROW 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ California reinstated the death penalty 20 years
ago. Considering what the punishment has come to represent, isn't
it time we bring the ritual of executions into line with reality?
</P>
<P>
   After all, there are more than 500 people on death row in
California. We need an updated formula to deal with such a crowd.
</P>
<P>
   First and foremost, we should stop executing people in the dead
of night in discreet little prison rooms that hold but a handful of
witnesses. Criminals are the ones who tend to commit their illegal
deeds after midnight in secretive, out-of-the-way places.
</P>
<P>
   Why should the state behave as if it, too, had something to
hide? Aren't we proud of what we're doing?
</P>
<P>
   Executions are the will of the people. Nearly 80 percent of
American adults say they are in favor of them.
</P>
<P>
   Let's get the action outside in the sunshine where it belongs
and schedule executions for noon or 2 p.m., instead of 12:01 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Let's perform them in some place that will hold thousands of
spectators _ like a ballpark during the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing prevents us. Because we Californians no longer kill with
the electric chair or gas chamber, a convicted man or woman can be
injected with lethal chemicals anywhere there are a gurney and a
few leather straps.
</P>
<P>
   Daytime public executions also would go a long way toward
helping us attain the most important aim of modern state-sanctioned
killing.
</P>
<P>
   No, we are not talking about crime deterrence. In the 12 states
that prohibit capital punishment, the murder rate is 3.5 per
100,000 population. In the 38 states that allow executions, the
rate is actually higher _ 6.6 per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   As for the time-honored argument that ``executed killers won't
kill again,'' it is no longer the deterrence trump card it once
was. A sentence of ``life without parole'' accomplishes the same
end.
</P>
<P>
   So, what is the primary aim of capital punishment today? In the
old days, executions were viewed as the grim but unavoidable duty
of a dispassionate and detached state, carrying out a uniformly
prescribed formula for justice.
</P>
<P>
   Today, we know that the death penalty is anything but uniformly
prescribed. In California and the rest of the nation, capital
punishment is disproportionately the sentence for killers who are
minorities and from backgrounds of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, state-sanctioned killing has evolved into a very
passionate and attached act; it exists to provide ``healing'' and
``closure'' for the relatives of murder victims.
</P>
<P>
   Their names and long wait for ``justice'' are continually
invoked by lawmakers and held up as the colossal counterweight to
any convicted killer's remorse, rehabilitation or mitigating mental
or physical circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. Pete Wilson was a particularly forceful proponent of
such healing-through-execution. When federal prosecutors accepted
Theodore Kaczynski's plea bargain for life without parole, Wilson
said he was ``deeply disappointed and disturbed.''
</P>
<P>
   Gone not only was ``a jury's right to decide whether (Kaczynski)
should have faced the death penalty,'' but the relatives of
Kaczynski's victims, Wilson said, ``have been cheated out of''
their opportunity for ``closure.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis, who is staunchly pro-death penalty, seems
similarly inclined. In his first clemency plea case in February,
Davis turned down Jaturun Siripongs' plea for mercy. Much more than
Siripongs' remorse and rehabilitation in prison, Davis said he was
moved by a ``direct, honest and eloquent'' letter written to him by
the daughter of one of Siripongs' two victims.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, despite pleas by Vietnam veterans and veteran
prosecutors, Davis denied Manuel Babbitt's petition for clemency.
He was executed early Tuesday at San Quentin.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 500 executions awaiting, shouldn't we
Californians optimize the potential for healing and closure?
</P>
<P>
   Come, let us move the death chamber out of the Dark Ages and
into the light of a new, more communal era. Let us fill the
coliseum and share in the vengeance.
</P>

LATEST ADIRONDACKS GUIDE STANDS OUT IN CROWDED FIELD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DENNIS APRILL  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The Adirondack Mountains of New York state cover
a vast area that seems to lure as many authors as tourists. Just
when you think every base has been covered, every aspect of the
6-million-acre park written about ten times over, along comes a new
book that creates its own niche.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Longstreet Highroad Guide to the Adirondacks'' is one of
these books. Author Phil Brown has written a travel guide and much
more. The wealth of information he presents goes beyond that found
in other field guides.
</P>
<P>
   For one, he covers the entire Adirondack Park, beginning with
its history, both geological and human. He divides the Adirondacks
into 10 regions, which, because of the geography of the area, is
not an easy job. The Adirondack Park is a mixture of ecosystems,
where you find such northern species as moose and fish and more
southern animals like opossum and timber rattlesnakes.
</P>
<P>
   Within each of these regions Brown describes ``the best of what
the Adirondacks have to offer, including hiking, camping, fishing,
canoeing, cross-country skiing, mountain biking, and horseback
riding.''
</P>
<P>
   For each mountain, pond or place of interest, the author not
only gives important and interesting information, but also precise
directions, facilities available, dates open, fees, and, in the
case of mountains, degree of difficulty, elevation and trail
length. It seems as though nothing is left out. That alone
impressed me, for I, too, am an author of an Adirondack trail guide
and know the amount of work and eye to detail needed to cover just
one trip, much less the entire park.
</P>
<P>
   But this book is not just an encyclopedia of useful information;
included with the text is a wealth of natural and cultural history
of the region. For example, in the section on Lake George, which
encompasses 35 pages, there are three maps, eight illustrations,
more than 20 destinations, with more side trips in each, and four
sidebars.
</P>
<P>
   These sidebars, darkened to stand out from the regular text,
contain some very interesting information. The ones in this section
cover the Adirondack Mountain Club and its history, the legend of
Rogers Rock, the Red Eft, and acid rain. (This sidebar might
actually be better placed in the western Adirondacks, where acid
precipitation is destroying aquatic life in lakes and ponds on a
grand scale.)
</P>
<P>
   Even more helpful information is found in the appendixes at the
back of the book. Here, Brown lists books and references,
conservation organizations, outfitters, tourism information, map
sources and special events, fairs and festivals in the Adirondacks.
High-quality illustrations by Danny Woodard of Loganville, Ga.,
complement the text and are sprinkled about the book in what seems
to be a random manner.
</P>
<P>
   The effect is eye-catching and unpredictable, since the
illustration pictured does not always reflect the flora or fauna
found in that particular chapter. The drawing of the boreal
chickadee, for example, is placed in the Lake George section
opposite the Submerged Heritage Preserve, the site where a French
and Indian War gunship sank, an unlikely place to find this bird.
Such an illustration might be better placed in the section
describing Bloomingdale Bog or some other boreal wetland.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous maps, number coded with text descriptions, liberally
dot the book and are very helpful in pinpointing the various points
of interest. Italicized scientific names are used for all flora and
fauna, and these terms, surrounded by parentheses, can slow reading
a bit. But, for those skimming the guide or looking for specific
destinations and trip overviews, the scientific names are easily
read through and add to the precision of the book.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, a former copy editor for the Albany Times Union, lets his
sense of humor shine through at times. Here's one example from the
High Peaks Chapter where he examines the frequent use of Indian
names in the Adirondack Mountains:
</P>
<P>
   ``Judging by place names, one might get the idea that Native
Americans visited the High Peaks Region as often as Adirondack
Mountain Club hikers. There is an Indian Pass, an Indian Falls, an
Indian Carry, and an Indian Head. Then there are the many
aboriginal names, some of dubious authenticity: Tahawas,
Nun-de-ga-o, Oseetah, She-gwi-en-dank-we.''
</P>
<P>
   From reading his guide, it is clear to me that Phil Brown has
spent a lot of time traveling and researching the Adirondack
Mountains. The information he presents is not only
all-encompassing, but up-to-date. In the Far North Region, for
example, he describes a stand of white birch on Lyon Mountain
``bent over like ballerinas; they have been frozen in that pose
since an ice storm of 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   Outdoor enthusiasts _ whether hikers, canoeists, mountain bikers
or just plain sightseers _ will find the ``Longstreet Highroad
Guide to the New York Adirondacks'' an important addition to their
Adirondack collections.
</P>
<P>
   For as the author so aptly put it in his preface:
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot guarantee that this book will find you a moose, but I
do hope it makes the search more enjoyable.''

SWANK TEXAS RANCH SELLS FOR $6.5M 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID HENDRICKS  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARRIZO SPRINGS, Texas _ A Houston hospital executive agreed to
pay $6.5 million for one of the most opulent ranches in Texas,
acquiring the sprawling South Texas property from a company owned
by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon.
</P>
<P>
   The bidding lasted only seven minutes Tuesday, with Charles
Veldekens of Houston topping Gill Hodges of San Antonio, who bid
$6.05 million for Crawford Farms.
</P>
<P>
   The seller of the 3,029-acre ranch outside Carrizo Springs was
the New York-based C.F. Han Corp., owned by Moon, who is also
leader of the Unification Church.
</P>
<P>
   The Han Corp. bought the trophy ranch in 1992 for $8.1 million
when it was auctioned by the original owner and builder, Don
Crawford. Crawford spent as much as $32 million to develop the
property in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past seven years, the Han Corp. had financed the
property through Crawford, who held a first-position lien. About $4
million remained as a balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always made their payments on time,'' said Crawford, who
was among 200 interested onlookers at the auction staged by
National Auction Group of Gadsden, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford, a wealthy businessman, now spends his days fishing
near his home on South Padre Island.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the Unification Church was not present at the
auction, but his son-in-law, businessman James Park, was. He
declined to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are satisfied with the auction. We wish the new owners
well. We know they will enjoy it to the utmost,'' Han
representative Michael Natbony said.
</P>
<P>
   National Auction Group President William Bone said the property
was used by Moon, his children and grandchildren as a horse-riding
retreat.
</P>
<P>
   Moon's Unification Church is known worldwide for its legions of
members, and for ceremonies to wed hundreds or thousands of couples
at one time.
</P>
<P>
   The auction attracted 18 bidders, six more than the 1992
auction, when Moon's company bought it. The auction attracted
attention because of its football field-sized, Spanish-style main
home; its large horse-show barn/arena with a saloon; numerous guest
homes; bass lakes and other amenities.
</P>
<P>
   The auction was held in the cavernous den of the main home.
Bidding started at $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   The final sales price in the contract will be $6.5 million, with
the auction company betting a 7.5 percent sales fee. The sale is
expected to close by June 3.
</P>
<P>
   Veldekens, 59, is chief executive of Doctors Hospital-Tidwell in
Houston. His wife, Ashley Veldekens, is a physical therapist. They
have three children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want my kids close to me,'' Veldekens said after placing the
winning bid.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford Farms will be a family home, said daughter Victoria
Roubal. ``We will all be moving here,'' she said. ``My father was
interested in bringing the family together, to grow old together.
We'll make it a place we'll be proud of.''

HEAVY SWEATING MAY BE SIGN OF BIGGER HEALTH PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Imagine needing to change your shirt three or
four times a day because of heavy perspiration. Or being unable to
take a test because your hands are too wet to grip a pen.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody has sweaty palms once in a while. People who exercise
or work outdoors also perspire to some noticeable degree. That's a
normal function of our bodies, which routinely produce sweat in
response to anxiety or to cool the body.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, however, for reasons that aren't always clear, people
produce excessive amounts of perspiration. Such heavy sweating
becomes a medical problem when it interferes with daily activities,
like shaking hands or working. Besides the social embarrassment,
such sweating can be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had patients who've electrocuted themselves with
appliances,'' said Dr. Bruce McCormack, a neurosurgeon in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Known as hyperhydrosis, the condition usually strikes at
puberty. That's when the apocrine sweat glands, those located in
the hairy parts of the body, kick in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people who have excessive sweating have trouble
writing,'' said Dr. Bernard McEvoy, the emeritus chief of
dermatology at Ellis Hospital in Schenectady, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their paper gets all wet. It's very difficult,'' McEvoy said.
``It's not awfully common but the people who have it feel like
they're alone in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Perspiration is already a function that most of us try to
ignore, with antiperspirants and deodorants that reduce or cover up
the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   For the 1 percent of people in the United States with
hyperhydrosis, those over-the-counter solutions offer no relief.
</P>
<P>
   On rare occasions, physicians may be able to identify the cause
of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Excessive sweating can sometimes by symptomatic of other medical
conditions, including pituitary or thyroid problems. More often
than not, physicians don't know the specific trigger, although they
believe it's linked to the nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   As a first line of treatment for hyperhydrosis, physicians
usually recommend their patients use a concentrated,
prescription-strength antiperspirant on the parts of the body that
perspire, including hands, feet and underarms.
</P>
<P>
   ``They work in 60 to 70 percent of the people I see,'' said Dr.
Mitchell Singer, a dermatologist in Schenectady.
</P>
<P>
   Other options include a battery-operated device that transmits a
tiny electronic signal through the skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current stimulates the sweat glands to drain them out,''
McEvoy said.
</P>
<P>
   A newer treatment involves injecting a small amount of toxin
into the palms or underarms. This potentially lethal toxin, when
tamed and distilled, interrupts some nerve signals, and is
currently used to treat muscle disorders and wrinkled skin. In some
patients with hyperhydrosis, it can stop sweating for up to 12
months.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another approach is endoscopic surgery to cut the nerves
that transmit signals to the sweat glands.
</P>
<P>
   As with any major surgery, however, there are risks, including
injury to the nerves that control the eyelid and pupil. Another is
compensatory sweating or excessive sweating that occurs in other
parts of the body, including the chest, thighs and legs.
</P>
<P>
   By the time most of McCormack's patients opt for surgery,
they've exhausted other solutions. ``I've had someone who was fired
because he stained the papers in the office,'' he said.

COLLEGE STUDENT EXCELS IN WORLD DOWN UNDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Julie Barber insists she doesn't fear sharks. She
respects them, but the creature that inspired ``Jaws'' is just
another fish in the sea as far as she's concerned.
</P>
<P>
   She knows firsthand, too. She has rubbed shoulders with sharks,
so to speak. She was diving off the Great Barrier Reef in Australia
last year and encountered sharks. And she wasn't afraid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sharks are not really threatening. A lot of them are
considered to be aggressive, and they attack from above,'' Barber
explained. ``They're predators and that's their natural behavior. I
respect that. I mean, I wouldn't go diving with a great white, but
I think sharks are really cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Barber, 21, is hoping she will encounter countless more sharks
during the year ahead. Barber, who will graduate from the
University of New Hampshire later this month with a major in marine
and freshwater biology and a minor in environmental conservation,
was named scholar of the year by the Our World-Underwater
Scholarship Society, a 25-year-old nonprofit organization. She has
so far received $20,000 for traveling and food expenses, as well as
state-of-the-art equipment from Rolex, Nikon, Kodak and the
society's myriad other sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   She plans to spend the next year diving and doing research on as
many as four continents, beginning her adventures on the East
Coast, working her way to Florida and then California before
visiting the Red Sea and Galapagos Islands.
</P>
<P>
   The scholarship society contacts will house her along the way,
and provide numerous educational opportunities, including a chance
to spend a week diving with the experts at National Geographic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I won the sweepstakes,'' Barber said. ``This is
going to be a great year, a year of diving and research and
traveling and awesome education and it's all paid for. It's an
awesome educational opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Barber, who is from the eastern New York town of Valatie, has
been infatuated with the ocean since she was in kindergarten and
her parents took her on a whale watch. None of her girlfriends
shared her interest, so she broadened her approach at Ichabod Crane
High School and founded the environmental club Students Against
Violating the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   But her passion was the sea, and what lived beneath the surface.
She took her first dive in high school, during a family vacation to
Aruba. She knew she wanted more.
</P>
<P>
   Barber chose her college based on its marine biology and
underwater programs. The University of New Hampshire has five
different marine laboratories, as well as research vessels. The
school is located 15 minutes from the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love diving in New England, because most people don't,'' she
said during a recent telephone interview. ``I go diving here in the
middle of winter in a wet suit. The water's about 32 and you can
stay under about 20 minutes. Then you get out and sometimes there's
a snowstorm. It's beautiful beyond words.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The water here is more nutrient-rich than it would be in a
coral reef,'' she said. ``There's a lot of invertebrate life. If
you know what you're interested in and know what you want to see,
you can see it diving in New England. And the nighttime diving here
is really cool. Everything around you glows. It's awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Harris, professor in marine biology at New Hampshire and
Barber's adviser for her honors thesis, noted that while most
students enter the program fascinated with marine mammals, they
soon move on to other areas. Few pursue their interest in depth, he
explained, but Barber has never veered off course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Julie is a nice combination of being very bright and capable
and curious and outgoing in a most positive way,'' Harris said.
``There have been a couple of other students over the years who
have applied for this scholarship and hers was one of the easiest
letter of recommendation I've written.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ There's nothing quite as soothing as the sound of
water trickling from a fountain. The sound has soothed people since
ancient Greece, where public fountains were the norm.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest evidence of an artificial fountain dates to 4,000
B.C. in what is now Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Early fountains built above natural springs were thought to have
magical powers, and many were enhanced with statues of gods and
goddesses.
</P>
<P>
   From the 1500s to the 1700s, elaborate pumping systems were
created for cascading water and powerful jets of water. During this
time, many of the famous Renaissance fountains were built, such as
the Trevi Fountain in Rome and those at the Palace of Versailles
near Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1960s, modern technology has utilized computerized
pumps to control the flow of water as well as the lighting.
</P>
<P>
   Fountains were originally used in public spaces. By the 1800s
and early 1900s they began gracing the grounds of private estates
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the residential fountain is used primarily as decoration,
and instead of being the focal point as in earlier formal estate
gardens, it's often incorporated as one part of the overall
landscape or garden design.
</P>
<P>
   Contemporary catalogs and garden centers offer a vast selection
of free-standing fountains that are formal, informal or whimsical
in nature. They also come with their own pumps.
</P>
<P>
   For the energy-minded, there are even solar-powered pond
fountains, which start at around $129 for a 12-volt pump,
fountainhead and four attachments that vary the spray pattern, from
Smith &AMP; Hawken, 800-776-3336. Small pumps start at $10 and go up
according to the amount of water that is to be pumped per minute.
There are also fountain kits, which start at about $60.
</P>
<P>
   Contemporary fountains come in a range of materials from cast
resins that simulate bronze to stone, concrete and marble, which
can cost in the thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the size and detailing, finished and unfinished
resin fountains cost anywhere from a few hundred dollars to $1,500,
according to Olsen's Nursery and Greenhouses in Slingerlands, N.Y.
Fountains are so tranquil that they have even made their way to
patios, balconies and indoors to the tabletop. Many of the small
fountains are vase-like or works of sculpted art and are powered by
a recirculating pump and an electrical outlet.
</P>
<P>
   Interior fountains also vary in price depending on their
complexity, with many starting at approximately $50.

BEST DIET FOR CHILDREN MAY BE NO TV 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ULYSSES TORASSA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Diet and exercise programs usually fail to
prevent obesity in kids, but a simpler approach may yield better
results: turning off the television, even if for an hour or less a
day.
</P>
<P>
   The idea already has the support of Surgeon General David
Satcher, who last month urged parents nationwide to limit their
children's TV viewing as part of an effort to improve public
health.
</P>
<P>
   In a study presented in San Francisco on Tuesday, researchers at
Stanford University helped to persuade nearly 100 third- and
fourth-graders in San Jose to cut their TV viewing by one-quarter
to one-third. At the end of the school year, the youngsters had
gained about two pounds less on average than a matched set of their
peers who kept up their normal habits.
</P>
<P>
   The results, presented to an audience at the Pediatric Academic
Societies annual meeting, dovetail with other studies showing that
adults and children who watch more TV tend to be heavier than those
who watch less.
</P>
<P>
   Obesity nationwide is on the rise, with 33 percent of U.S.
adults considered overweight. Twenty years ago, 10 percent of
children were considered overweight; now the figure is 20 percent,
according to Len Epstein of the State University of New York at
Buffalo, who studies pediatric obesity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really kind of scary the rate at which we're seeing
increasing obesity in kids and adults, in this country and around
the world,'' said Thomas N. Robinson, assistant professor of
pediatrics and medicine at Stanford University. Robinson conducted
the study.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, TV-watching in the United States remains high,
with the average child younger than 11 watching nearly 20 hours per
week.
</P>
<P>
   Obesity is one of the hardest conditions to prevent and treat.
Programs aimed at keeping people from smoking, drinking and taking
drugs have far higher success rates than those aimed at keeping
people fit and slim, Robinson said.

SOME BOOKS THAT MAY CHALLENGE AND CHANGE THE READER

 &HT;

Times Syndicate please contact syndicate sales representative DEBRA
WEYDERT at 732-390-4480)
 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    As the school year winds down, I look forward to summer reading.
There's nothing like getting lost in a good book while relaxing on
the porch swing or at the beach. Summer provides an excuse to catch
up on books I want to read.
 &HT;    This year, I started summer reading earlier than usual and have
been reading spiritual autobiographies.
 &HT;    Maybe I'm just nosy, but I love memoirs. I first became
acquainted with the genre of spiritual autobiography while a
college student. Since then, I have read hundreds, ranging from St.
Augustine's ``Confessions'' and St. Teresa of Avila's
``Autobiography'' to C.S. Lewis's ``Surprised by Joy'' and Thomas
Merton's ``Seven Story Mountain.''
 &HT;    However worthy these classics, this year I decided to limit my
reading to contemporary spiritual autobiographies.
 &HT;    Every time I visit the local bookstore I find two or three new
spiritual-journey books. As a fan of the classics, I admit to
having been a bit skeptical regarding the current publishing craze.
Over the months, however, I bought a couple dozen interesting
titles and finally dedicated myself to reading them. Many are
intelligent and insightful renderings of vital spirituality. I have
been challenged and, in some cases, changed by reading these books.
 &HT;    Here are some suggestions for a spiritual summer reading list:
 &HT;    More than any other writer, Kathleen Norris has mastered this
genre. Her best-selling books testify to her grace and insight.
``Cloister Walk'' and ``Amazing Grace'' are thoughtful
interpretations of traditional Christianity. However, do not miss
her first and less well-known book, ``Dakota.'' Its spare and
poetic prose communicates spirituality in small community better
than any book I have ever read.
 &HT;    ``Ordinary Time'' by Nancy Mairs could not be a greater contrast
to Norris. She writes crisply and bluntly: ``Religious belief is
something like masturbation: You may do it -- and it won't even
make you crazy or give you warts if you do -- but it's the sort of
thing you keep to yourself.'' Mairs is not for the spiritually
timid.
 &HT;    Gary Dorsey's ``Congregation'' narrates a single year at First
Church in Windsor, Connecticut. Dorsey, a journalist, begins by
reporting on church life. Within months, however, the line between
reporter and parishioner blurs. This is a funny book -- with a
complete cast of crusty New England characters and New Age
baby-boomer seekers. More like a novel than non-fiction, I had to
keep reminding myself it was true!
 &HT;    ``Encountering God'' by Harvard professor Diana Eck recounts her
journey from her Methodist childhood in Bozeman, Montana to being
transformed while studying Hinduism in India. Well-written and
theologically sophisticated, Eck explores the issues surrounding
American religious pluralism. This book is deeply Christian and
completely inclusive -- a model of religious dialogue and a good
introduction to Hinduism.
 &HT;    A new book, ``The Ironic Christian's Companion'' by Patrick
Henry, pushes Christians to embrace doubt as a way to God. Henry
knits together church history, contemporary events and his own life
experience and points out that God may be found in the
least-expected places -- such as a classroom at Swarthmore College,
the feminist Re-Imagining Conference, and in divorce and death.
Although the author is not ordained, I wished every minister in
America was as pastoral as Henry.
 &HT;    Two books by gay men address the issues facing Christian
homosexuals. John McNeill's ``Both Feet Firmly Planted in Midair''
and Mel White's ``Stranger at the Gate'' helped me, as a
heterosexual wife and mother, understand the painful struggle of my
gay and lesbian friends regarding faith and identity. McNeill, a
liberal Roman Catholic, and White, a conservative evangelical, come
to the point of self- and divine acceptance from opposite sides of
the theological fence. But they wind up in remarkably the same
place. I found these books profoundly human -- and should not be
limited in readership to the homosexual community.
 &HT;    Julius Lester's ``Lovesong'' recounts his conversion from
Methodism to Judaism. Lester, an African-American and son of a
southern Methodist minister, struggles with a lifetime of exclusion
until he meets God in Judaism. There, ``exclusion'' melts into
finding meaning through a distinctive community. ``Being a Jew,''
he writes, ``is more than loving Judaism; it is also belonging to a
people.''
 &HT;    ``Things Seen and Unseen'' by Nora Gallagher is another year at
church -- this time Trinity Episcopal in Santa Barbara. Her book
captures the ethos of contemporary Episcopalianism: contemplative
and activist. She takes the reader into the secret places of
Christian community as the people pray, serve the poor, minister to
one another, and struggle with the big issues of the day --
including having a gay priest.
 &HT;    Enjoy!

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    For reasons that often have little to do with journalism, it can
be surprisingly difficult to maintain a commitment to honest and
courageous reporting while trying to cover certain wars.
 &HT;    The sacred principle of our business is objectivity, and in the
nine years I've been covering war, I've come to learn exactly what
objectivity means _ whether in wars between nations like the
Persian Gulf War or dirty civil wars like Somalia or the kinds of
genocidal campaigns against civilians that have plagued the end of
our century from Yugoslavia to Rwanda.
 &HT;    The only way I can discuss the difficulties of covering the
crisis in Kosovo is by relating my personal experiences. To me,
this war is still mainly between Yugoslav forces _ special police
units and paramilitaries _ against a civilian population in the
name of rousting terrorists.
 &HT;    A fundamental problem of the coverage concerns objectivity.
First and most important, I have learned that ``objective'' does
not mean ``neutral.'' The sometimes obsessive desire to find equal
weight between two sides is often simply wrong. There is no moral
equivalence between the aggressor and the victim, a civilian who
has been raped and the thug who did it.
 &HT;    Let's be clear: Objectivity means trying to give all sides a
hearing. It does not, in my view, mean treating all sides as equal.
That, I believe, would be a fundamentally incorrect and immoral
application of objectivity.
 &HT;    This is what the French writer and philosopher Albert Camus
warned: Not choosing is also a choice. I have chosen to apply, to
the best of my ability, contextual objectivity to all my reporting,
especially during war and especially when confronted with the most
serious crimes against humanity as determined by the international
conventions. I insist on putting my reports in context, and I am
often strongly impassioned. I won't apply moral equivalents where
none exist.
 &HT;    At the Kosovo-Albanian border, watching what was happening,
seeing babies and old people and sick people and handicapped people
being forced to march out of their country and listening to their
stories, I reported the tragedy and it was one of the most
difficult things I've had to do in a long time. It was essentially
all of the experience of Bosnia telescoped into a very short period
of time.
 &HT;    We are human beings; I make no excuse for that. Yet our humanity
needs to come across without overwhelming what we do. I have
learned to direct the incredible emotional burden and the physical
and mental pain of what we see into telling the story. Our task is
comparable to that of emergency-room doctors who cannot help but be
affected by what they see yet cannot allow it to overwhelm their
professional obligations.
 &HT;    And that brings us to a second difficulty when covering war,
especially in places such as Serbia which by any definition is a
dictatorship and which has iron-tight state-controlled media that
gives out propaganda and hate and which, importantly, is the only
source of information for most Serbians. This difficulty is
censorship.
 &HT;    I am, without wanting to be self-serving, CNN's longest-serving
Balkan hand. And yet I am no longer in Belgrade because the Serb
authorities hate my reporting.
 &HT;    On March 24, the night the air war started, I was in Belgrade
describing the action from a hotel rooftop when mayhem broke out:
Plainclothes police were carting other journalists off and
deporting many of them. In my case, the notorious paramilitary
known as ``Arkan'' _ his name is really Zeljko Raznjatovic _ had
his thugs looking for me. They burst into a colleague's office, put
everyone against the wall, brandished automatic weapons and began
yelling for me. This is because I had done an investigative report
about Arkan's work _ what he had done during the Bosnian war.
 &HT;    Before the NATO bombing began, Serb television went on a fierce
anti-Western journalist campaign, blaming foreign correspondents
for bringing in NATO, specifically calling CNN ``a factory of
lies.'' It became impossible for me to report, and because of the
direct threats I left Belgrade.
 &HT;    Even after other reporters were returning, a high-level Yugoslav
minister told CNN that I could not go back because they could not
guarantee my security. That is a threat. Then they allowed CNN to
put another, more presumably to-their-liking correspondent in
Belgrade. In my view that is censorship. It is at least control.
 &HT;    And throughout we have endured a form of censorship there, as
have all the other news organizations. Our crews are escorted by
special government or police minders. They are not free to go where
they want, when they want, and they have to rely mostly on Serbian
television pictures. This isn't to say that CNN or others shouldn't
be there, but simply that our viewers should know all the
restrictions we operate under.
 &HT;    The ultimate form of censorship, of course, is expelling all
journalists from Kosovo and keeping them under tight control in
Belgrade. For myself, I ended up on the border where we had much
better access to information. The testimony of those people being
deported en masse, their shocking and consistent accounts, built a
chilling and brutal picture of ethnic cleansing and executions,
separation of men and women, rape _ and all of this against
civilians.
 &HT;    In my years of covering Bosnia, Croatia and Kosovo, the most
terrible things were often first reported by journalists from
eyewitness accounts. And then they were proven true: the death
camps in Bosnia, the mass graves, for instance.
 &HT;    Of course, none of the Albanian refugees on Serbian television
are portrayed as fleeing the terror campaign; Serb officials insist
they are only fleeing NATO bombing. And most Serbs believe that.
They don't have a choice. There is no alternative to them other
than state-controlled media.
 &HT;    Some ask, but doesn't NATO also restrict its information _
impose censorship? The answer is, of course, yes. We don't get the
full story in real time from NATO. But again, in my view, there is
no moral nor practical equivalent between a dictatorship carrying
out what many are now calling crimes against humanity and a
military organization of the free democratic world which is subject
to scrutiny of a free and vigorous press.
 &HT;    And lest anyone doubt Belgrade, one of the few prominent
independent Serbian journalists was recently shot dead near his
home. This has a chilling effect.
 &HT;    Consider the way some Western news organizations covered Arkan,
whose secret indictment by the war-crimes tribunal at The Hague was
made public on March 31. He was either sought out or offered
himself up for interviews; he is a legitimate news story. But if
one is going to give a man like that air time, in my view, one is
obliged to challenge him.
 &HT;    This is one of the most brutal psychopathic killers to patrol
the Balkans. Yet several global news organizations allowed him to
simply air his views. He was allowed to accuse me of getting him
indicted, and CNN of lying about the plight of Kosovar Albanians.
It was predictable, yes. But unchallenged, surely we cannot accept
that.
 &HT;    The burden surely is on the reporters to face him with knowledge
and information, to have the courage and willingness to do it
right. Anyone indicted for the most grave of crimes against
humanity is not a chat-show guest. Just imagine giving Hitler's
henchmen a platform to simply air their views. We cannot go for the
easy way. It is worth getting in a few pointed questions, even if
it means getting thrown out. Otherwise, don't do the interview, it
isn't worth it.
 &HT;    I raise this because it in turn leads to another awkward
question: What price access? Indeed these are the important and
uncomfortable questions, the difficulties of war coverage. They are
magnified a million times when you deal with a regime based on
terror _ and one that targets journalists too. How to maintain your
objectivity without forcing equality on an unequal situation. How
to get around censorship. And how to keep your honor and
credibility as well as your access.

 IN INDIA, CHILDHOOD is FOR SALE

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Sonia is 12 and blind; not surprisingly, she has never played
with footballs, but from age six she was forced to stitch them,
eight hours a day, seven days a week. Her dainty, deft fingers
would often pierce her tiny hands with the needle as she pieced
together tough bits of leather.
 &HT;    But the child taught herself never to yelp in pain for fear of
losing employment, which would have threatened her family's
survival. Yet at the end of each day, she had not earned enough to
buy even a loaf of bread.
 &HT;    Still, Sonia was one of the lucky ones. Kailash Satyarthi, who
has been fighting child labor for the last two decades, raided the
factory _ media in tow _ where she and many other children worked.
After a tough fight through headlines that embarrassed the football
manufacturer, Mayor and Co., Sonia was given back her childhood.
She now lives in the state Vocational Rehabilitation Center for the
Blind in Ludhiana, Punjab.
 &HT;    Kailash, who is 44, has seen many such misery-ridden Sonias
through to happy endings, yet he is no invincible hero. In fact,
the crusade he has launched against child servitude in South Asia
has seen him coping with as many disheartening defeats as
victories.
 &HT;    ``How can I gloat over little triumphs when I see so many
children being wasted as overworked and underpaid help at squalid
factories, dingy shops and affluent urban homes every single day of
my life? When I know that parents still give children away at brick
kilns to work as bonded laborers as repayment of debt?''
 Millions of Workers, Millions of Slaves  
 &HT;    Sikander was 17 when he joined the Delhi shelter after six years
of inhuman working conditions in a carpet factory in the Mirzapur
district in Uttar Pradesh. Forced from age 10 to support a widowed,
ailing mother and two younger siblings, Sikander toiled 12 hours a
day to keep starvation at bay.
 &HT;    ``I worked in tin sheds, which get terribly hot during summers.
Also'' _ and he winced as he recalled those times _ ``we were often
beaten if we made any mistakes.'' Then he was rescued by Kailash's
network, and he is now training to become a welder.
 &HT;    Of the estimated 140 million working children in India, nearly
half are, in effect, slaves. Poverty-stricken parents who need
paltry sums of money _ sometimes just for basic sustenance _ borrow
from moneylenders and literally sign away their livelihoods
forever.
 &HT;    ``There is just too much of this around for us to feel content
about our work,'' Kailash said. ``A problem of such a large scale,
I have come to believe, has to be fought strategically: Raids,
rescue and rehabilitation have to go hand in hand with engineering
national and international aversion and support against child
labor.''
 &HT;    This is the philosophy that Kailash practices, that has spurred
him and his organization, the South Asian Coalition Against Child
Servitude, to identify and liberate more than 34,000 children
working in industries across India, where grimy little hands
working to fight hunger are an accepted reality. Even the upwardly
mobile middle-class thinks little of employing young children to
prepare their morning cuppa because such domestic help is plentiful
and cheap.
 &HT;    And parents in the poverty-ridden rural pockets are often forced
to barter their children to repay debts that keep death away.
 The Economics of Bonded Labor  
 &HT;    Many companies fight to keep child laborers at work because to
the manufacturers, it makes good economic sense. Factories making
carpets, sporting goods, firecrackers, bangles and brassware prefer
smaller hands to do the intricate work especially because children
do not demand better working conditions or more pay.
 &HT;    There are also criminal elements who conspire to control the
network of children in servitude and thwart the laws that ban
employment of youngsters. As a result, no employer has ever been
punished for violating a 1986 act that prohibits employing children
in the carpet industry, a sector defined as hazardous. Frequently,
employers of child labor shield their enterprises by posing as
family concerns.
 &HT;    Kailash has attacked this evil despite the many powerful
interests that resist any change that could damage profit margins.
 &HT;    He also recognized that the rescued children need
rehabilitation, and in 1991, he established the Mukti Ashram
(Shelter for the Liberated) in Delhi, which is run by volunteers.
He has also established 14 informal education centers, which are
funded by such international agencies as Bread for the World,
Christian Aid, Terre des Hommes and Miserior.
 &HT;    The first shelter found Kailash knocking on doors _ literally _
with requests for donations. ``I guess because the initiation of
the shelter saw ordinary people personally involving themselves in
the cause by giving it their hard-earned money,'' he said, ``the
project has always been run at a personal level: Each child is
special to us. Before we train them in a vocation, we make sure
there is a need for such skills in their village. If the locality
has no tailors or is short on a radio repairer, then that's the
skill we prepare the child for. Along with education, of course.''
 Escape Through Education
 &HT;    At Mukti Ashram, the children get basic training in literacy,
health and social issues. Those over 14 get vocational training in
such trades as carpentry, tailoring and making cane and bamboo
products. There are group discussions on the legal system and
children's rights, as well as current political issues. The
youngsters also help manage the ashram, thus acquiring leadership
skills.
 &HT;    Once the children return to their villages, the ashram keeps
track of how they fare. Many become economically independent,
setting up small enterprises. Most importantly, these rehabilitated
youngsters are helping to teach their communities to fight for
their rights in order to prevent further bondage.
 &HT;    Some of the youngsters return to help Kailash in the
raid-and-rescue operations. Thirteen-year-old Mohan, from Bihar
state, was rescued from a carpet factory in Uttar Pradesh, where he
had worked from age seven to 10. After a year in the Mukti Ashram
in New Delhi, it became clear that he was a bright youngster, and
Kailash enrolled him in one of the marches against child labor.
After this Mohan returned to his village and gave talks in local
schools about the cruel realities of child labor.
 &HT;    Fourteen-year-old Govind is doing the same. An underpaid
telephone booth attendant during the day and a cook at night for a
shopkeeper in the Nepal-Sikkim border town Jhaba, the boy was
rescued by Kailash's activists about three years ago. Once at the
shelter, Govind impressed everyone by his quick mind and grasp of
academic subjects, so he was encouraged to be part of all the
coalition's rallies and marches.
 &HT;    He returned from a three-week visit to his village near Jhaba
and informed Kailash about the local networks that he has set up
there. He went to each family in his village and informed them of
the poor conditions their children work in once they are sent away
to the bigger cities.
 &HT;    ``He is so fired up by what he has learnt here,'' Kailash said,
``that he now plans to go to different villages in India and talk
of his experiences as a child who had to work 16 hours a day. My
children are all so bright. They are going to change society.'' He
calls them ``young multipliers of the message.''
 &HT;    Through the Coalition, which was founded in 1989, Kailash has
supplemented these individual rescue operations with a vigorous
campaign to garner public opinion against child labor. Today The
South Asian Coalition Against Child Servitude comprises 400 partner
organizations, including human rights groups and trade unions in
Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Sri Lanka.
 &HT;    ``The need for comrades in the combat was obvious,'' he said.
``I realized that children in the region were all facing the same
pernicious fate, and that the fight had to be for all of them.
Banning child labor in India would only shift businesses that
thrive on such inexpensive labor to the neighboring countries.
These children are ours, you cannot shun their problems because
they don't share your nationality.''
 &HT;    Every wall in Kailash's small, functional office in South Delhi
seems to reflect this belief. Huge black and white photographs of
children from South Asian countries who are working away their
childhood crowd the office, reminders that millions will have to
join hands to save the millions suffering.
 &HT;    He points at them and says, ``Children are world citizens and
the world must come together to save them.''
 &HT;    It was this global outlook that brought Kailash to push through
a carpet-consumers' awareness campaign that culminated in the
creation of Rugmark, a label that certifies carpets made without
child labor. To be Rugmark-certified, carpet manufacturers agree to
independent monitoring and inspections. A presentation by Kailash
in 1991 before a U.N. human rights subcommission in Geneva resulted
in U.N. endorsement of the label.
 The Power of a Positive Label 
 &HT;    He is unwilling to hazard a guess on the percentage of carpet
manufacturers who comply with the Rugmark requirements, but he
points out that Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, Britain and the
United States import only Rugmark carpets from the Subcontinent.
The certification is not foolproof, of course.
 &HT;    James Tufenkian, an American who is on the board of Rugmark and
whose company employs about 6,000 weavers in Nepal, was quoted in
The New York Times last October as saying, ``While Rugmark's heart
is 100 percent in the right place, how can we know what's really
going on in the weavers' homes?''
 &HT;    Added to these advocacy efforts, Kailash has organized many
marches in India and Nepal as part of an ongoing protest against
child labor. His latest effort saw him co-ordinating a Global March
Against Child labor this year. Commencing in January 1998, the
march saw activists, supporters and many a child laborer march in
Asia, Africa, America, Australia and Europe and many of them
traveled to Geneva in June for the drafting of a new convention on
child labor by the International labor Organization.
 &HT;    ``Marches have been so much a part of the Indian tradition of
protest,'' Kailash says. ``Mahatma Gandhi used marches effectively
to protest British laws.'' Kailash also wrote 800 letters to
organize different groups for the March to Geneva.
 &HT;    Gauri Pradhan, of NGO Child Workers in Nepal, credits Kailash
with having made the cause a regional rather than a
country-specific issue; Ishtiaque Ahmed, who works against child
labor in Dhaka, Bangladesh, credits Kailash with perseverance and
vision.
 &HT;    Not that Kailash is hungering for appreciation; he is quite
prepared to meet any criticism that might come his way and advances
some himself: ``People might say we have no business touring the
world when the problem of child labor is nowhere near eradication
back home. But that's a very narrow approach. In today's globalized
world you can't sort out anything by remaining home.''
 An Early Start  
 &HT;    Kailash's first brush with child labor was close to home in a
small town in Madhya Pradesh. Perplexed to see the cobbler's son
not attending school like him, 7-year-old Kailash innocently asked
why, only to be told that children born to the ``untouchable''
castes in India have no option but to work.
 &HT;    The sentence stuck with him. So did the desire to change the
terrible truth of the statement.
 &HT;    Years later, while studying electrical engineering at the
Regional Engineering School in Vidisha, Madhya Pradesh state, where
he was born, he organized a book bank to help those students who
could not afford new textbooks.
 &HT;    After teaching engineering for a few years Kailash decided to
work more directly for social change. ``The world had to know the
shocking truth. And I chose not to remain with a mainstream
profession but to change things. I walked out of home.'' Now,
others walk with him, in his marches against the sale of childhood.

 IN INDIA, CHILDHOOD is FOR SALE

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Sonia is 12 and blind; not surprisingly, she has never played
with footballs, but from age six she was forced to stitch them,
eight hours a day, seven days a week. Her dainty, deft fingers
would often pierce her tiny hands with the needle as she pieced
together tough bits of leather.
 &HT;    But the child taught herself never to yelp in pain for fear of
losing employment, which would have threatened her family's
survival. Yet at the end of each day, she had not earned enough to
buy even a loaf of bread.
 &HT;    Still, Sonia was one of the lucky ones. Kailash Satyarthi, who
has been fighting child labor for the last two decades, raided the
factory _ media in tow _ where she and many other children worked.
After a tough fight through headlines that embarrassed the football
manufacturer, Mayor and Co., Sonia was given back her childhood.
She now lives in the state Vocational Rehabilitation Center for the
Blind in Ludhiana, Punjab.
 &HT;    Kailash, who is 44, has seen many such misery-ridden Sonias
through to happy endings, yet he is no invincible hero. In fact,
the crusade he has launched against child servitude in South Asia
has seen him coping with as many disheartening defeats as
victories.
 &HT;    ``How can I gloat over little triumphs when I see so many
children being wasted as overworked and underpaid help at squalid
factories, dingy shops and affluent urban homes every single day of
my life? When I know that parents still give children away at brick
kilns to work as bonded laborers as repayment of debt?''
 Millions of Workers, Millions of Slaves  
 &HT;    Sikander was 17 when he joined the Delhi shelter after six years
of inhuman working conditions in a carpet factory in the Mirzapur
district in Uttar Pradesh. Forced from age 10 to support a widowed,
ailing mother and two younger siblings, Sikander toiled 12 hours a
day to keep starvation at bay.
 &HT;    ``I worked in tin sheds, which get terribly hot during summers.
Also'' _ and he winced as he recalled those times _ ``we were often
beaten if we made any mistakes.'' Then he was rescued by Kailash's
network, and he is now training to become a welder.
 &HT;    Of the estimated 140 million working children in India, nearly
half are, in effect, slaves. Poverty-stricken parents who need
paltry sums of money _ sometimes just for basic sustenance _ borrow
from moneylenders and literally sign away their livelihoods
forever.
 &HT;    ``There is just too much of this around for us to feel content
about our work,'' Kailash said. ``A problem of such a large scale,
I have come to believe, has to be fought strategically: Raids,
rescue and rehabilitation have to go hand in hand with engineering
national and international aversion and support against child
labor.''
 &HT;    This is the philosophy that Kailash practices, that has spurred
him and his organization, the South Asian Coalition Against Child
Servitude, to identify and liberate more than 34,000 children
working in industries across India, where grimy little hands
working to fight hunger are an accepted reality. Even the upwardly
mobile middle-class thinks little of employing young children to
prepare their morning cuppa because such domestic help is plentiful
and cheap.
 &HT;    And parents in the poverty-ridden rural pockets are often forced
to barter their children to repay debts that keep death away.
 The Economics of Bonded Labor  
 &HT;    Many companies fight to keep child laborers at work because to
the manufacturers, it makes good economic sense. Factories making
carpets, sporting goods, firecrackers, bangles and brassware prefer
smaller hands to do the intricate work especially because children
do not demand better working conditions or more pay.
 &HT;    There are also criminal elements who conspire to control the
network of children in servitude and thwart the laws that ban
employment of youngsters. As a result, no employer has ever been
punished for violating a 1986 act that prohibits employing children
in the carpet industry, a sector defined as hazardous. Frequently,
employers of child labor shield their enterprises by posing as
family concerns.
 &HT;    Kailash has attacked this evil despite the many powerful
interests that resist any change that could damage profit margins.
 &HT;    He also recognized that the rescued children need
rehabilitation, and in 1991, he established the Mukti Ashram
(Shelter for the Liberated) in Delhi, which is run by volunteers.
He has also established 14 informal education centers, which are
funded by such international agencies as Bread for the World,
Christian Aid, Terre des Hommes and Miserior.
 &HT;    The first shelter found Kailash knocking on doors _ literally _
with requests for donations. ``I guess because the initiation of
the shelter saw ordinary people personally involving themselves in
the cause by giving it their hard-earned money,'' he said, ``the
project has always been run at a personal level: Each child is
special to us. Before we train them in a vocation, we make sure
there is a need for such skills in their village. If the locality
has no tailors or is short on a radio repairer, then that's the
skill we prepare the child for. Along with education, of course.''
 Escape Through Education
 &HT;    At Mukti Ashram, the children get basic training in literacy,
health and social issues. Those over 14 get vocational training in
such trades as carpentry, tailoring and making cane and bamboo
products. There are group discussions on the legal system and
children's rights, as well as current political issues. The
youngsters also help manage the ashram, thus acquiring leadership
skills.
 &HT;    Once the children return to their villages, the ashram keeps
track of how they fare. Many become economically independent,
setting up small enterprises. Most importantly, these rehabilitated
youngsters are helping to teach their communities to fight for
their rights in order to prevent further bondage.
 &HT;    Some of the youngsters return to help Kailash in the
raid-and-rescue operations. Thirteen-year-old Mohan, from Bihar
state, was rescued from a carpet factory in Uttar Pradesh, where he
had worked from age seven to 10. After a year in the Mukti Ashram
in New Delhi, it became clear that he was a bright youngster, and
Kailash enrolled him in one of the marches against child labor.
After this Mohan returned to his village and gave talks in local
schools about the cruel realities of child labor.
 &HT;    Fourteen-year-old Govind is doing the same. An underpaid
telephone booth attendant during the day and a cook at night for a
shopkeeper in the Nepal-Sikkim border town Jhaba, the boy was
rescued by Kailash's activists about three years ago. Once at the
shelter, Govind impressed everyone by his quick mind and grasp of
academic subjects, so he was encouraged to be part of all the
coalition's rallies and marches.
 &HT;    He returned from a three-week visit to his village near Jhaba
and informed Kailash about the local networks that he has set up
there. He went to each family in his village and informed them of
the poor conditions their children work in once they are sent away
to the bigger cities.
 &HT;    ``He is so fired up by what he has learnt here,'' Kailash said,
``that he now plans to go to different villages in India and talk
of his experiences as a child who had to work 16 hours a day. My
children are all so bright. They are going to change society.'' He
calls them ``young multipliers of the message.''
 &HT;    Through the Coalition, which was founded in 1989, Kailash has
supplemented these individual rescue operations with a vigorous
campaign to garner public opinion against child labor. Today The
South Asian Coalition Against Child Servitude comprises 400 partner
organizations, including human rights groups and trade unions in
Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Sri Lanka.
 &HT;    ``The need for comrades in the combat was obvious,'' he said.
``I realized that children in the region were all facing the same
pernicious fate, and that the fight had to be for all of them.
Banning child labor in India would only shift businesses that
thrive on such inexpensive labor to the neighboring countries.
These children are ours, you cannot shun their problems because
they don't share your nationality.''
 &HT;    Every wall in Kailash's small, functional office in South Delhi
seems to reflect this belief. Huge black and white photographs of
children from South Asian countries who are working away their
childhood crowd the office, reminders that millions will have to
join hands to save the millions suffering.
 &HT;    He points at them and says, ``Children are world citizens and
the world must come together to save them.''
 &HT;    It was this global outlook that brought Kailash to push through
a carpet-consumers' awareness campaign that culminated in the
creation of Rugmark, a label that certifies carpets made without
child labor. To be Rugmark-certified, carpet manufacturers agree to
independent monitoring and inspections. A presentation by Kailash
in 1991 before a U.N. human rights subcommission in Geneva resulted
in U.N. endorsement of the label.
 The Power of a Positive Label 
 &HT;    He is unwilling to hazard a guess on the percentage of carpet
manufacturers who comply with the Rugmark requirements, but he
points out that Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, Britain and the
United States import only Rugmark carpets from the Subcontinent.
The certification is not foolproof, of course.
 &HT;    James Tufenkian, an American who is on the board of Rugmark and
whose company employs about 6,000 weavers in Nepal, was quoted in
The New York Times last October as saying, ``While Rugmark's heart
is 100 percent in the right place, how can we know what's really
going on in the weavers' homes?''
 &HT;    Added to these advocacy efforts, Kailash has organized many
marches in India and Nepal as part of an ongoing protest against
child labor. His latest effort saw him co-ordinating a Global March
Against Child labor this year. Commencing in January 1998, the
march saw activists, supporters and many a child laborer march in
Asia, Africa, America, Australia and Europe and many of them
traveled to Geneva in June for the drafting of a new convention on
child labor by the International labor Organization.
 &HT;    ``Marches have been so much a part of the Indian tradition of
protest,'' Kailash says. ``Mahatma Gandhi used marches effectively
to protest British laws.'' Kailash also wrote 800 letters to
organize different groups for the March to Geneva.
 &HT;    Gauri Pradhan, of NGO Child Workers in Nepal, credits Kailash
with having made the cause a regional rather than a
country-specific issue; Ishtiaque Ahmed, who works against child
labor in Dhaka, Bangladesh, credits Kailash with perseverance and
vision.
 &HT;    Not that Kailash is hungering for appreciation; he is quite
prepared to meet any criticism that might come his way and advances
some himself: ``People might say we have no business touring the
world when the problem of child labor is nowhere near eradication
back home. But that's a very narrow approach. In today's globalized
world you can't sort out anything by remaining home.''

 &HT;    Kailash's first brush with child labor was close to home in a

 &HT;    
 &HT;    Moving halfway across the country from California to Tennessee
has not been the easiest thing I have ever done. Nearly two years
after the move, I still suffer from culture shock and protest when
anyone calls Memphis my ``home.''
 &HT;    There is, however, one place in Memphis where I feel at home: my
front porch. I have never lived in a house with a front porch
before. Our ninety-year-old house boasts a front porch that runs
the whole width of the house. There is a porch swing, white wicker
furniture with chintz cushions, a child's rocking chair, ferns and
flowering plants, and a vase full of blooms from the garden.
 &HT;    Come May, it is my favorite room in the house.
 &HT;    Until I moved to Memphis, I never knew I was a front porch
person. In California, we have decks, courtyards, and patios. These
private spaces conceal family life and personal time. Guests must
be invited in and through the house to share community with the
household in the back yard.
 &HT;    But front porches are different. In our neighborhood, the
household spills out onto the street. Up and down the block,
families play and work in public with one another. One neighbor
feeds her baby on the front porch. Another gathers neighborhood
news and shares it with all interested passersby. One family keeps
a mini-trampoline on their porch and we can watch their children
bounce. The teenagers across the street play guitar on their porch.
My daughter and I like to swing together or sit and eat popsicles
in our chairs.
 &HT;    In the evening, tired parents often flee to their porches with
glasses of wine or cups of coffee. We swap tips on child-rearing
and gardening. We try to outdo one another with stories on whose
house needs the most work. If you ever need to borrow something or
want to just visit, an accommodating neighbor is often on the porch
waiting for you.
 &HT;    Our porches are like a church. They serve as the foundation of
our community, a place to know one other and be known, to meet each
other's needs and to be with one another in need. The porch is
sacred space where intimate stories play on a public stage.
 &HT;    In his book, ``After Heaven: Spirituality in America Since the
1950s,'' Princeton sociologist Robert Wuthnow identifies two
spiritual styles in contemporary religion: seeking and dwelling.
 &HT;    ``In Western religion,'' he writes, ``habitation spirituality is
suggested in stories of the Garden of Eden and of the Promised
Land; it consists of temple religion; and occurs in the time of
kings and priests.''
 &HT;    ``A spirituality of seeking is tabernacle religion, the faith of
pilgrims and sojourners; it clings to the Diaspora and to prophets
and judges.... One is symbolized by the secure life of the
monastery, the cloister, the shtetl; the other by peregrination as
a spiritual ideal.''
 &HT;    Wuthnow believes that ``dwelling spirituality'' has given way to
``seeking spirituality.'' For most people, the idea of fixed place
has lost sacred significance in favor of spiritual journey.
 &HT;    There is, however, something odd about this in relation to my
porch. My neighbors are Wuthnow's seeker-types. With a couple of
exceptions, most of the people on my street have lived there less
than five years; most have lived in places other than Tennessee.
They are baby-boomer couples with young children who have chosen
the old neighborhood. Our families make up the porch-sitting
habitation spirituality. Seeking brought us to a neighborhood where
dwelling sustains us.
 &HT;    G.K. Chesterton once remarked that ``I am the man who discovered
England.'' He searched the world to find spiritual meaning only to
find what was always in front of him -- Christian faith.
 &HT;    T.S. Eliot wrote, ``And the end of all our exploring will be to
arrive where we started and know the place for the first time.''
 &HT;    Sometimes I think of Chesterton and Eliot when I sit on the
porch. Seeker that I am, I find it strange that a porch swing could
offer so much spiritual comfort. When I greet neighbors walking
children and dogs, or observe the seasonal changes in my garden, I
hear the strains of the old Shaker hymn in my head: ``'Tis the gift
to be simple, 'Tis the gift to be free, 'Tis the gift to come down
where we ought to be.'' The porch teaches me that in seeking we may
not always find but, at least, there can be rest.
 &HT;    Yes, there is the journey, all that restless seeking. But then
there is a May afternoon on the porch swing. Maybe I am just the
woman who discovered England.

   RENO-GUNS (Washington) _ In the wake of the Littleton, Colo.,
high school massacre, senators accuse Attorney General Janet Reno

Army's Apache helicopter was a technological star, destroying Iraqi
tanks with precision and speed. But now, during the Kosovo crisis,
the gunships have gotten off to an inauspicious start. Following
two crashes and the deaths of two crew members, we look at the
reasons for the failures. By ERIC ROSENBERG.

NATIONAL PARKS NOW AVAILABLE FOR MONOPOLY MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDVINS BEITIKS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Parker Brothers, a division of the toy and game
maker Hasbro Inc., introduced another special edition of Monopoly
to mark Earth Week, the tribute to the environment celebrated in
late April.
</P>
<P>
   This version of the game _ there are 50 of them in all _ is
backed by the National Park Foundation, which gets a percentage of
the proceeds from sales. But there's something a little off-kilter
here.
</P>
<P>
   Parker Brothers' idea of tipping a cap to Earth Week is to let
people buy up National Park properties and charge fellow players
rent to drop in, a study in gouging that folds well into the
tradition of American commercialism. The National Parks edition of
the game is directed at nature lovers who ``can vie to land on some
of the most valuable, tranquil and serendipitous property in the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The first park for sale is the National Mall in Washington,
D.C., which goes for $60 and calls for a charge of $2 when other
players land there. Mount Rushmore, too, sells for $60, and then
prices get truly weird.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Canyon, which some see as the crown jewel of the 28
national park slots on the Monopoly board, goes for a measly $140 _
the same as Glacier Bay, less than Hawaii Volcanoes. (Some Tammany
pork, perhaps, set aside for a cigar-chomping wheezer feeding
politicos cash under the table.)
</P>
<P>
   Valley Forge and Gettysburg sell for $180 and Little Bighorn for
$200. Following the board around, the Badlands are available for
$220 (rent $18), and the asking price for both the Everglades and
the Great Smoky Mountains is $300. A payout of $75 has to be made
if a player lands on the ``Dinner at Ahwahnee'' square, and the
Broadway and Park Place of the National Parks edition are Yosemite
($350) and Yellowstone ($400).
</P>
<P>
   Yellowstone worth $50 more than Yosemite? Hmmmmmm. More funny
business.
</P>
<P>
   National trails like Window and Limberlost take the place of the
railroads, while Chance and Community Chest cards have been changed
to read ``Volunteer at Point Reyes National Seashore _ Collect
$100,'' ``Park Closed Due to Flood _ Go Back 3 Spaces'' and
``Caught Looting Archeological Dig _ Go to Jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of homes and hotels, the game offers tents and ranger
stations, and the metal play-pieces include a hiker, canoe, tent,
ranger hat and grizzly bear.
</P>
<P>
   Like other special editions of Monopoly, the National Parks game
sells for $35. Special editions produced by the Rhode Island toy
and game maker already include NASCAR, Harley- Davidson, bass
fishing, the Napa Valley, Cincinnati, Super Bowl XXXII, golf and
the U.S. Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Others due out this year include Marvel Comics, Mustang cars and
California.

SIMON &AMP; WHO? GARFUNKEL MAKES HIS OWN WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDY CORDOVA  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - While talking with Art Garfunkel, the unspoken
question hangs in the air, creating an odd bit of tension.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bit like having a conversation with O.J. Simpson and
dancing around the subject of Ronald Goldman. Or speaking with Bill
Clinton but politely avoiding any references to a certain
beret-wearing brunette.
</P>
<P>
   With Garfunkel, possessor of one of the most virginal voices in
pop music, the million-dollar question has to be, Why the heck is
Paul Simon so amazingly famous and his former singing partner is .
. . well, not?
</P>
<P>
   Being polite, one doesn't ask. But the 57-year-old Garfunkel
does discuss his sometimes prickly relationship with Simon, a
partnership that was one of the most celebrated in music history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a great motivating effect on each other,'' he says, a
tad professorial from his New York home. ``We were impressed with
each other, and we worked to impress the other one. It was like an
electric buzz between us.''
</P>
<P>
   The duo of Simon &AMP; Garfunkel originally disbanded in 1970, six
years after their first album, ``Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.'' In
between came a number of astonishingly crisp and lasting songs that
helped define the turbulent time: ``Mrs. Robinson,'' ``The Sound of
Silence'' and ''Bridge Over Troubled Water,'' among many others.
</P>
<P>
   Garfunkel's almost feminine tenor was one hallmark of the duo.
The other was Simon's prolific songwriting ability, because
Garfunkel wrote virtually none of the material.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both complemented each other quite nicely,'' Garfunkel
says. ``I had very good ears for what he was doing. I quite enjoyed
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But once the partnership came to an end, Simon moved from
adventurous strength to strength. He's still big news in 1999, as
he gets ready to launch a nationwide arena tour with Bob Dylan.
</P>
<P>
   As for Garfunkel, he didn't stagnate. But hit songs like 1973's
pretty ``All I Know'' and a 1978 version of Sam Cooke's ``Wonderful
World'' were pleasant without really being essential. A film career
peaked early with 1971's ``Carnal Knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   In the years after the breakup, Garfunkel seemed to merit the
most attention whenever he reunited with Simon. There was a 1975
``Saturday Night Live'' appearance and 1981's mammoth Central Park
concert. But other than those occasional moments, he seems to have
dropped from the celebrity radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, it's not surprising. For one, even though he has kept
a journal for years and has published a book of poetry, Garfunkel
is not a songwriter. It's something that puzzles him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do see the oddity of it,'' he muses. ``It's been too much of
a compelling question mark through the years. I write melodies
effortlessly. As a harmony person, I'm (begin ital) always (end
ital) writing melodies. But maybe if my head was just tilted
another four degrees, it would be different.''
</P>
<P>
   He's in the midst of a tour that he has been on since last July,
bringing hits from both phases of his career. He happily trots out
the classics for nostalgic boomers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were a member of the audience, I'd want to hear the
hits,'' he says. ``But for me, I particularly love it when
something goes wrong. At those moments, the performer gives you
some information about who they are. You can see this so-called
star, and see how they react when there is horrific feedback or
when the arrangement goes wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's natural to wonder if he misses performing with
Simon.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's the duo, it's its own art form,'' he says. ``There
were a lot of advantages. I had to find my way without him. But
now, I quite enjoy being able to set up on my own, to sing what I
want to sing.'' &QL;

   JERUSALEM _ The May 17 elections for Israeli prime minister, and
the possible June 1 run-off, are expected to be split along ethnic
and religious lines. That's how elections have long been decided in
what many call Israel's ``tribal'' society.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, Jews of European descent, Arabs and secular voters
prefer the left-wing Labor Party while Russian immigrants, Jews of
North African and Asian descent, and religious voters back
right-wing Likud.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at ethnic voting patterns based on research on the
1996 election when the Likud Party's Benjamin Netanyahu narrowly
beat the Labor Party's Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
   ETHNIC GROUPS:
</P>
<P>
   Group: Jews of recent African and Asian descent.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Yitzak Soudri's vision of Israel is different from
the one most Americans imagine from afar.
</P>
<P>
   For Soudri, a spokesman for the ultra-religious Shas Party,
Israel is not the mythic Zionist refuge, where pioneers band
together for common survival.
</P>
<P>
   He sees what is often called the ``tribal'' Israel. In that
Israeli reality, Shas and their supporters, the ``Sephardim'' of
Asian and North African descent, battle daily against the
``Ashkenazim'' elites from Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to start from the assumption that there's a culture
war in the country,'' Soudri says. ``In the last 15 years, Shas has
been destroying everything (the elites) have tried to create . . .
what we're doing frightens every secular Ashkenazi.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the May 17 elections for parliament and prime minister are
intensifying Israel's battles between the tribes. Tribes that seem
to be growing farther apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are remarkably similar to each other compared to
Israelis,'' says Michael Walzer, who studies Israel for the
Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton, N.J. ``Among the
(countries) I know, Israel is the most polarized.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel's current divisions are no surprise. The country was born
only 50 years ago. It has since been rapidly populated by
immigrants speaking different languages, socialist ideologues
fighting for liberation and ultra-religious Jews seeking biblical
land.
</P>
<P>
   Shas and the other Sephardim, olive-skinned and usually working
class, clash with the fair-haired and wealthier Askenazim.
Ultra-Religious Jews in black suits and fedoras attack secular Jews
in tie-dye. The growing Russian and Arab minorities cluster in
their own ethnic parties seeking influence as tie-breakers among
the bigger players.
</P>
<P>
   The population of 6 million is changing. Religious Jews and
Arabs have large families, so their numbers increase. A million
Soviet immigrants have arrived since 1989. And, Israelis are what
one pollster calls, ``calcified voters.'' Repeatedly, Sephardim and
the religious Jews back right-wingers, while Ashkenazim, secular
Jews and Arabs back left-wingers.
</P>
<P>
   They battle daily in the press, politics and sometimes the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each group thinks they only have to worry about themselves.
Extremism is growing,'' said Orthodox Rabbi Yehuda Gilad, leader of
a small mixed party of religious and secular leaders. ``I think the
majority is sick of this trend.''
</P>
<P>
   But, moderation does not look likely.
</P>
<P>
   The Center Party, formed to bridge cultural and political gaps,
is floundering. Extreme religious parties are flexing their muscle
with street protests. The small, combative Change Party benefits
from the backlash by attacking the religious, their military
exemptions and their use of government money for their schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we were defending the state, somebody stole it from
behind our backs,'' says Change candidate Tommy Lapid.
</P>
<P>
   The major candidates for prime minister, right-wing incumbent
Benjamin Netanyahu and left-wing Labor Party challenger Ehud Barak,
are tuning their appeals to ethnic ears. Sometimes they try to
remind people of the common good, sometimes not.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has publicly apologized for historic mistreatment of the
Sephardim by his Ashkenazim. Both parties run campaign ads with
Russian subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   But, this week, a comedian at a Labor Party rally made fun of
the Sephardim -- calling them ``rabble'' -- and Netanyahu's Likud
Party turned it into a campaign commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu later toured a produce market, reportedly saying,
``these so-called elites, they hate the people. They hate
Sephardim.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sephardim make up about 35 percent of the voters -- more
than the Ashkenazim -- and the parliamentary system increases their
clout.
</P>
<P>
   Since only a majority of parliament can recall a prime minister,
any leader has to build a coalition of several small parties to
stay afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Amid it all, the country's major issue, relations with it's Arab
neighbors, can be decided almost as a by-product of the tribal
competition.
</P>
<P>
   A prime minister can either find himself hostage to the many
demands of small parties or exploit the competition between them to
steer the country toward solutions with the Arabs -- something most
Israelis support.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives you a lot of leverage,'' said Israeli political
scientist Shmuel(cq) Sandler. ``You can buy them off.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Shas wants more government money for religious
schools and Shas welfare services. The peace process is less
important.
</P>
<P>
   When left-winger Yitzhak Rabin agreed to their demands, they
joined his coalition and helped him ratify the historic Oslo Peace
Accords. In 1996, when Benjamin Netanyahu agreed to their demands,
they bolstered his coalition and helped him bring the Oslo process
to a tense standstill.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Shas finds new competition from other ethnic parties.
</P>
<P>
   The main Russian party is running commercials in Russian
exhorting voters to give it more parliamentary seats than Shas.
</P>
<P>
   With that clout, the ad promises, it will be able to force the
next prime minister to remove the Shas leadership of the
immigration ministry and install a secular Russian in the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is going to give (the ministry) to us just as a
gesture,'' says Natan Sharansky, leader of the party.
</P>
<P>
   In return for its demands, the Russians would set aside their
hawkish views on the peace process. They backed the dovish Rabin in
1992. Seeking a better deal, they flipped and backed the hawkish
Netanyahu in 1996.
</P>

   But, prime ministers can also find themselves at what many call
the ``blackmail'' of the tribes.
</P>
<P>
   The religious parties, for example, threatened to bring down
Netanyahu's government if he backed proposals to recognize the less
traditional Reform and Conservative forms of Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's predicament is summed up artfully by an animated
political commercial for the left-wing Meretz Party.
</P>
<P>
   It shows an exhausted Netanyahu dancing to a caricature
``Klezmer'' band of notable religious leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the tribes choose the music and the prime

<P>
   Even Netanyahu supporters found it amusing. But, given the tense
political climate and Israel's tribal voting habits, few will
change their vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least it brought a smile to people's faces,'' said Meretz
parliamentarian Nomi Chazan. ``That's something.''

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Yitzak Soudri's vision of Israel is different from
the one most Americans imagine from afar.
</P>
<P>
   For Soudri, a spokesman for the ultra-religious Shas Party,
Israel is not the mythic Zionist refuge, where pioneers band
together for common survival.
</P>
<P>
   He sees what is often called the ``tribal'' Israel. In that
Israeli reality, Shas and their supporters, the ``Sephardim'' of
Asian and North African descent, battle daily against the
``Ashkenazim'' elites from Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to start from the assumption that there's a culture
war in the country,'' Soudri says. ``In the last 15 years, Shas has
been destroying everything (the elites) have tried to create . . .
what we're doing frightens every secular Ashkenazi.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the May 17 elections for parliament and prime minister are
intensifying Israel's battles between the tribes. Tribes that seem
to be growing farther apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are remarkably similar to each other compared to
Israelis,'' says Michael Walzer, who studies Israel for the
Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton, N.J. ``Among the
(countries) I know, Israel is the most polarized.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel's current divisions are no surprise. The country was born
only 50 years ago. It has since been rapidly populated by
immigrants speaking different languages, socialist ideologues
fighting for liberation and ultra-religious Jews seeking biblical
land.
</P>
<P>
   Shas and the other Sephardim, olive-skinned and usually working
class, clash with the fair-haired and wealthier Askenazim.
Ultra-Religious Jews in black suits and fedoras attack secular Jews
in tie-dye. The growing Russian and Arab minorities cluster in
their own ethnic parties seeking influence as tie-breakers among
the bigger players.
</P>
<P>
   The population of 6 million is changing. Religious Jews and
Arabs have large families, so their numbers increase. A million
Soviet immigrants have arrived since 1989. And, Israelis are what
one pollster calls, ``calcified voters.'' Repeatedly, Sephardim and
the religious Jews back right-wingers, while Ashkenazim, secular
Jews and Arabs back left-wingers.
</P>
<P>
   They battle daily in the press, politics and sometimes the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each group thinks they only have to worry about themselves.
Extremism is growing,'' said Orthodox Rabbi Yehuda Gilad, leader of
a small mixed party of religious and secular leaders. ``I think the
majority is sick of this trend.''
</P>
<P>
   But, moderation does not look likely.
</P>
<P>
   The Center Party, formed to bridge cultural and political gaps,
is floundering. Extreme religious parties are flexing their muscle
with street protests. The small, combative Change Party benefits
from the backlash by attacking the religious, their military
exemptions and their use of government money for their schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we were defending the state, somebody stole it from
behind our backs,'' says Change candidate Tommy Lapid.
</P>
<P>
   The major candidates for prime minister, right-wing incumbent
Benjamin Netanyahu and left-wing Labor Party challenger Ehud Barak,
are tuning their appeals to ethnic ears. Sometimes they try to
remind people of the common good, sometimes not.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has publicly apologized for historic mistreatment of the
Sephardim by his Ashkenazim. Both parties run campaign ads with
Russian subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   But, this week, a comedian at a Labor Party rally made fun of
the Sephardim -- calling them ``rabble'' -- and Netanyahu's Likud
Party turned it into a campaign commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu later toured a produce market, reportedly saying,
``these so-called elites, they hate the people. They hate
Sephardim.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sephardim make up about 35 percent of the voters -- more
than the Ashkenazim -- and the parliamentary system increases their
clout.
</P>
<P>
   Since only a majority of parliament can recall a prime minister,
any leader has to build a coalition of several small parties to
stay afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Amid it all, the country's major issue, relations with it's Arab
neighbors, can be decided almost as a by-product of the tribal
competition.
</P>
<P>
   A prime minister can either find himself hostage to the many
demands of small parties or exploit the competition between them to
steer the country toward solutions with the Arabs -- something most
Israelis support.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives you a lot of leverage,'' said Israeli political
scientist Shmuel(cq) Sandler. ``You can buy them off.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Shas wants more government money for religious
schools and Shas welfare services. The peace process is less
important.
</P>
<P>
   When left-winger Yitzhak Rabin agreed to their demands, they
joined his coalition and helped him ratify the historic Oslo Peace
Accords. In 1996, when Benjamin Netanyahu agreed to their demands,
they bolstered his coalition and helped him bring the Oslo process
to a tense standstill.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Shas finds new competition from other ethnic parties.
</P>
<P>
   The main Russian party is running commercials in Russian
exhorting voters to give it more parliamentary seats than Shas.
</P>
<P>
   With that clout, the ad promises, it will be able to force the
next prime minister to remove the Shas leadership of the
immigration ministry and install a secular Russian in the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is going to give (the ministry) to us just as a
gesture,'' says Natan Sharansky, leader of the party.
</P>
<P>
   In return for its demands, the Russians would set aside their
hawkish views on the peace process. They backed the dovish Rabin in
1992. Seeking a better deal, they flipped and backed the hawkish
Netanyahu in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But, prime ministers can also find themselves at what many call
the ``blackmail'' of the tribes.
</P>
<P>
   The religious parties, for example, threatened to bring down
Netanyahu's government if he backed proposals to recognize the less
traditional Reform and Conservative forms of Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's predicament is summed up artfully by an animated
political commercial for the left-wing Meretz Party.

political climate and Israel's tribal voting habits, few will
change their vote.

GUMBEL BACK IN THE `PUBLIC EYE' AS A MORNING HOST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   So Bryant ``Will You Still Respect Me in the Morning?'' Gumbel
is going back to the breakfast shift. Why, you ask, would he return
to the ham-and-eggs scene after tasting USDA prime-time?
</P>
<P>
   Well, for one thing, no one seemed to notice Gumbel in the
gloaming. His ``Public Eye With Bryant Gumbel,'' the CBS evening
newsmagazine for which he forsook his NBC roots two years ago,
wasn't exactly in the public eye. CBS canceled it after less than a
year, and Gumbel has been cooling his heels _ and his fat five-year
contract _ ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Second, with apologies to Tom, Dan, Peter and the nightly news
crowd, mornings are the new battleground. ABC didn't put Diane
Sawyer and Charles Gibson back on ``Good Morning America'' simply
as a public-relations stunt. Remember when they took over in
January? It was billed as a temporary thing. But what's great about
a temporary thing is that you can still say it's a temporary thing
three years from now. Technically, I suppose Dick Clark's gig on
New Year's Eve is just a temporary thing.
</P>
<P>
   Gumbel's return to the a.m. shift, as the host of CBS's morning
show _ it probably won't be called ``This Morning'' _ doesn't
happen until Nov. 1, once CBS has finished building a new
street-front home a la NBC's ``Today.'' But Tuesday's announcement
was still momentous enough to be tendered jointly by Leslie
Moonves, president and CEO of CBS Television, and Andrew Heyward,
president of CBS News.
</P>
<P>
   This, after all, is Bryant Gumbel, king of the interrogators,
honcho of hauteur, the guy who spent 15 years at ``Today'' and had
much to do with its being the top-rated player in the morning-news
game. Oh, yeah. Moonves and Heyward also mentioned that Steve
Friedman is part of this new deal. Friedman, who will be senior
executive producer of Gumbel's show, did two stints at ``Today'' in
his 16 years at NBC, both during Gumbel's tenure. It was under
Friedman that ``Today'' regained the No. 1 morning spot, so CBS
evidently thinks mornings are worth fighting for.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are committed to being a major player in morning
television,'' Moonves said via press release. ``With today's
announcement, we have the elements in place to build upon the
progress already generated by Andrew Heyward and his current
morning-show team. You don't build a facility like this unless you
intend to fill it with the most gifted people in television _ and
we have that with Bryant Gumbel and Steve Friedman.''
</P>
<P>
   And now, Heyward: ``There's only one thing better than having
Bryant Gumbel and Steve Friedman return to morning television, and
that's having it happen on CBS. They don't just know how to compete
in the morning; they know how to win. And that's what we ultimately
intend to do, with a program that's smart, timely, fresh and
engaging.''
</P>
<P>
   Whew! All of that must make Mark McEwen and Jane Robelot feel
just ducky. They're the current hosts of CBS's ``This Morning,''
co-architects of Heyward's ``progress'' and soon-to-be frequent
fliers at Kinko's.
</P>
<P>
   No word on who might be co-hosting with Gumbel. The name of ABC
news anchor Elizabeth Vargas always surfaces at times such as this.
And at least one newspaper report on Tuesday floated Deborah
Norville, Gumbel's one-time partner at ``Today,'' as a possibility.
Both, however, are generally perceived as icy (Norville's
appearances on ``Hollywood Squares'' notwithstanding), and Gumbel
alone is good for an acute case of freezer burn.
</P>
<P>
   Better to go after a warmer persona. The choice here would be
someone like Margaret Larson, another ``Today'' alum. Like Gumbel,
Larson is whip smart, self-assured and incredibly articulate.
Unlike Gumbel, she's disarming and approachable _ a perfect
complement to Gumbel's seeming brusqueness.
</P>
<P>
   Last time we talked, Larson said she had no desire to return to
a full-time, high-profile network job. Can't blame her, really. The
former Seattle TV anchor now works part time for ``Dateline NBC''
and gets to live in Seattle. Admittedly, not a bad gig. But if CBS
wants to win in the morning, it would do well to find a Larson
clone to team with Gumbel. While ``Today'' remains No. 1, it's not
as good as it was when the ``cool'' Gumbel teamed with the ``warm''
Katy Couric.
</P>
<P>
   Odds 'n' ends
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Ling, 25, is the new co-host of ABC's ``The View.'' Ling
beat out more than 17,000 wannabes seeking to replace Debbie
Matenopoulos, who was dismissed from the morning chatfest four
months ago. Most recently, Ling was a reporter for ``Channel One
News,'' a news show broadcast to high schools and middle schools
nationwide.

JACKSON MAY HAVE DONE JOB TOO WELL  
 (ADV: THIS EDITORIAL APPEARED IN THE MAY 5 ARIZONA REPUBLIC) 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Perhaps nothing more clearly demonstrates the paradox
of the Rev. Jesse Jackson's successful effort to free three
American servicemen from their Serbian captors than the photo of
Jackson and Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic holding hands
and praying.
</P>
<P>
   It is not hard to imagine what, in fact, the Butcher of Kosovo
is praying for: The swift departure, safe or otherwise, of every
ethnic Albanian from Serbia. And it is equally easy to envision
Jackson's intercession helping to get that prayer answered.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it was wonderful seeing the smiling faces of the three
young American soldiers in the company of the American minister who
persuaded the Serbian strongman to release them. Their families are
relieved and grateful. Americans who fretted for their safety are
exultant. But, no, this is no way to run a war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope no American has any (impression) that Mr. Milosevic has
become a Boy Scout,'' said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., on CBS'
``Face the Nation'' on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it is the indifference among the American public to
whether he is a Boy Scout or a butcher that Milosevic is likely
counting on.
</P>
<P>
   No one's fool, he understood that until the NATO bombs began
dropping on his nation, few Americans knew Belgrade from Belfast.
He also knew they would tolerate few, if any, casualties to protect
residents of a Serbian province almost none of them had known
existed.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, fumed conservative commentator William Kristol,
Jackson ``is behaving as an instrument of Milosevic's propaganda.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's avocation as a freelance diplomat has earned
impressive results. In 1990, he helped manage the release of more
than 700 women and children who were being used by Saddam Hussein
as human shields during Iraq's occupation of Kuwait. And in 1984,
his banner year, he effected the release of a downed U.S. Navy
pilot from Syrians in Lebanon and 22 Americans and 26 Cubans from
Cuban prisons. But the minister's problem may be that he does his
``job'' too well.
</P>
<P>
   The very Balkan dilemma that Jackson now creates for President
Clinton and his NATO allies is that his mission will succeed
entirely _ that it will help end the bombing and bring parties to
the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   If that occurs, Milosevic wins, since bombs will have ceased
dropping on Serbia while hundreds of thousands of Kosovars languish
in the muck and mire as refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Who will go, then, to rescue them? &QL;

COMPANY BOOST AIDS PROGRAM WITH $1M DONATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GREGORY LEWIS and ULYSSES TORASSA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Backed by a $1 million corporate donation, Mayor
Willie Brown has launched an AIDS and HIV program that will focus
on education, prevention and awareness, especially for minorities,
women and young gay men.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor hopes the program, which he announced Tuesday as
another way to stem the spread of HIV and AIDS, will encourage
other businesses to contribute $5 million over five years to the
program. DuPont Pharmaceuticals donated $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been an increase in the number of people infected,
particularly in communities of color. The education and information
has not penetrated (there) the way it should have,'' Brown said
Tuesday in announcing the city program.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont President Nicholas Teti, who participated in the program
announcement, said: ``Adequate funding often turns a new idea into
a successful idea. DuPont's $1 million grant sets the initiative on
the path to success. We're inviting other businesses in San
Francisco to help us raise $5 million.''
</P>
<P>
   AIDS is an affliction in which the human immunodeficiency virus
weakens the immune system, subjecting the body to serious
infection. AIDS is most often spread through sexual contact,
sharing contaminated needles and infected blood products.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS activists weren't necessarily overjoyed by the DuPont
contribution.
</P>
<P>
   When word spread last year that DuPont's new AIDS drug Sustiva
would cost much more than other drugs in its class, activists
formed a Fair Price Coalition and went to the company's
headquarters to try to persuade DuPont to reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   They had little success, according to Linda Grinberg, a member
of the coalition and a Los Angeles AIDS activist.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Getty, an AIDS activist who takes Sustiva, called the
company's announcement a public relations move to try to deflect
attention from its pricing policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than give in and reduce the price of the drug, they're
throwing this money around,'' he said. ``I'm not against
prevention, I just don't know if I want to pay for it when I buy my
drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Teti acknowledged the controversy over the price of Sustiva but
said, ``We felt that it was priced extremely fair.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials say the money raised from the program could make
a lot of difference to prevention programs, which now have an $11
million a year budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``A million a year on an $11 million budget will make a big
difference,'' said Norm Nickens, deputy director of the Department
of Public Health.

GOGH AWAY, YOU'RE MUCH TOO CLOSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - I was staring into Vincent Van Gogh's fierce blue
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   I was captivated by them _ the color of the sky, steady,
unnerving, determined. I studied his nose, protruding, balled at
the tip.
</P>
<P>
   I was amazed that after writing countless papers on and seeing
this very same image in art history books all through college, I
was standing in front of the real thing at the Los Angeles County
Museum of Art. The wonder of it all got to me so thoroughly, the
back of my neck started to feel hot.
</P>
<P>
   And then it got hotter, and then it got hotter and hotter.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, for me to get that excited, cream sauce and goat cheese
have to be involved.
</P>
<P>
   As I turned to investigate the source of the heat, I saw a short
little man with the face of a goblin, standing very close and
literally breathing down my neck. My friend Jamie, who was standing
next to me, saw him, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``How's that body-lice thing going?'' she said to me loudly.
``Got it under control yet?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying, but it means bathing EVERY DAY,'' I replied.
``Don't come any closer, sister! Doc says they can jump 3 whole
feet!''
</P>
<P>
   My neck returned to its normal temperature as the goblin
scurried away.
</P>
<P>
   I'm pretty sure I already know what my last words are going to
be, and it's a tossup between ``Pass the salt'' and ``Would you
please stop touching me!,'' though my money's on the latter.
</P>
<P>
   I need my space, and not in a metaphorical sense. I want, at all
times, to be able to thrust my arms outward, twirl and not touch a
single thing, because that's my space and it belongs to ME. If
people insist on breaching that respect, I can't help it; I'll just
want to fight them, most preferably in a parking lot. One careless
step from a stranger into my twirling circle, and it's all fists
and elbows.
</P>
<P>
   It's painfully obvious that some people have no knowledge of the
personal space, thrust-and-twirl rule, especially in grocery lines,
escalators and elevators.
</P>
<P>
   If I ever became president, the first thing I would do is set up
boundaries and make it a law that if a stranger got closer than 2
feet from me in a grocery line, I could put them under citizen's
arrest. Escalators would be painted with a green step and the word
``Welcome,'' then a red step and the words ``Back off, creeper!,''
then another green step.
</P>
<P>
   The floors of elevators would be equipped with a grid, and if
you stepped out of your square, you would be exiled to the stairs
forever, smoker or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unbelievable,'' Jamie said as we moved on to the next Van Gogh
painting as the exhibit began to fill up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a scientific fact that people shouldn't be that close to
one another. I heard about this experiment where scientists put a
bunch of deer on an island and it got too crowded and they all
DIED. When places get overpopulated, you stop flourishing!''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was BREATHING on me,'' I informed her. ``Breath that came
from inside his body, and frankly, I don't want to come into
contact with ANYTHING from inside anyone else's body!''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a biohazard, plain and simple,'' she said as we passed
another painting, and I believed her because she's a
microbiologist. ``It's nothing but exhaust! Germwise, your butt
won't get people as sick as your mouth will.''
</P>
<P>
   That was not good news, since it was apparent that the museum
had sold tickets to 600 other people for the same time slot we had.
The steady stream of people showed no indication of slowing, and
ALL of them were breathing.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the four rooms of Van Gogh paintings, it was getting as
crowded as a Dillard's shoe sale as people came at us from all
angles, fighting for the best view of the paintings. Soon, we were
but two faces in a sea of steaming, open, germ-filled mouths.
</P>
<P>
   I tried to keep my space by taking tiny steps away from other
folks, but then they would take a tiny step, too, not understanding
that my tiny step was not the ``Oh, look, we're moving ahead''
step, but the ``Get away from me before I file sexual harassment
charges against you'' step. One fellow got so close to me that I
wanted to ask him if any of my moles had changed colors.
</P>
<P>
   The rooms were getting more and more crowded, people were
getting closer and closer until I felt like I was 11 years old
again, stuffed in the back seat of the Country Squire station
wagon, screaming at the top of my lungs, ``THEY'RE ALL TOUCHING
ME!!!!!''
</P>
<P>
   More and more people crowded in to admire the art, and I clung
to Jamie as the crowd pushed the two of us together so closely we
briefly considered dating.
</P>
<P>
   In front of the painting of Van Gogh's bedroom, someone helped
himself to a handful of Jamie's backside, and I saw her scream as
the tangle of bodies picked me up and carried me to another room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not flourishing!'' I yelled to her as we lost grasp of
each other. ``I'm definitely not flourishing!''
</P>
<P>
   She looked me in the eye and raised her fist as the wave carried
me farther out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't forget!'' she pronounced over the crowd. ``Thrust and
twirl! Don't let history forget!''
</P>
<P>
   Before I knew it, the mob had dumped me in the Van Gogh Mall,
which was supposed to be a gift shop at the end of the exhibit. If
I thought people were behaving badly while trying to get their five
seconds in front of a Van Gogh masterpiece, the true horror didn't
unveil itself until the element of merchandise was introduced.
</P>
<P>
   Though I had the opportunity to purchase an empty absinthe set
for $70, a magnet for $10, or a watch with the face of a painting
Jamie's back end was fondled in front of for $60, I quickly
snatched up a catalog and figured that, since I had barely seen any
of the paintings, I might as well start forming fake memories from
the pictures.
</P>
<P>
   I was getting ready to buy the catalog when Jamie got spit out
of the crowd at the entrance to the mall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was socked in the gut by an old man, pinched on the arm by a
lady, and a strange child grabbed my boob,'' she said as she came
toward me, adjusting her bra. ``But I think we're safe now!''
</P>
<P>
   I was about to agree when I felt the temperature at the back of
my neck suddenly rise. &QL;

NEW ORLEANS VISIT MAY INCLUDE OTHER DEGAS STOPS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Optional trim included) 
(Eds.: Also see: Degas-review) 
 
By SYD KEARNEY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ If the just-opened Edgar Degas exhibit makes an
impression, you may want to explore other locations linked to the
French painter who visited in 1872.
</P>
<P>
   Your first stop should be the lovingly restored Degas House at
2306 Esplanade, just a short drive from the New Orleans Museum of
Art. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the house
is a museum that focuses on the legacy of Degas, who lived in the
home with his Creole relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The house was about 20 years old when Degas, then 38 and living
in Paris, arrived in New Orleans. The original house was twice as
large, but in the 1920s it was cut in half to create the
mirror-image homes known as the Degas House and Degas II.
</P>
<P>
   The Degas Foundation, which purchased the structures and is
responsible for their restoration, has mounted a series of exhibits
in conjunction with the NOMA event. Visitors will find displays
focusing on architecture and the yellow fever epidemic (which
felled several of Degas' family members) as well as a time line
that traces the painter's life.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors also will see the rooms in which Degas painted.
According to foundation director David Villarrubia, the artist's
failing eyesight forced him to work indoors. He often painted in
what is now the breakfast room. Among the 17 works he completed
while living in New Orleans are ``Portrait of Estelle'' and ``A
Cotton Office in New Orleans.''
</P>
<P>
   The home is open for tours 9 a.m.-5 p.m. daily. Admission is
$10. Call 504-821-5009.
</P>
<P>
   Other Degas houses to see are the Pitot House and the
Hermann-Grima House.
</P>
<P>
   The Pitot House, an exquisite West Indies-style plantation house
that overlooks Bayou St. John, is a short walk from the NOMA.
Constructed in the late 1700s, the house was the home of Degas'
maternal grandmother. It is furnished in period antiques. Located
at 1440 Moss St., the Pitot House is open to visitors 10 a.m.-3
p.m. Wednesdays through Saturdays. Admission is $3 ($1 for
children). Call 504-482-0312.
</P>
<P>
   The historical Hermann-Grima House is hosting ``An Evening With
Edgar Degas.'' The performances, offered at 5:30 p.m.
Tuesdays-Saturdays through Aug. 31, feature conversations with
Degas, played by an actor. The shows will be held in the courtyard.
Tickets are $12.50. Call 504-525-5661.
</P>
<P>
   Three French Quarter restaurants are offering a Degas Creole
dinner after the show. The price includes the performance, meal,
tax and gratuities. Cost for the Gumbo Shop is $45; Arnaud's, $70;
and Galatoire's, $75. Call 504-522-5555 for tickets and dinner
reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Two other New Orleans restaurants have created Degas-inspired
menus. The Degas Cafe, located at 3127 Esplanade, is just a short
distance from the NOMA and the Degas House.
</P>
<P>
   The casual bistro concentrates on French cuisine during its
daily lunch and dinner, while brunch is offered on Saturdays and
Sundays. Its Degas specials are for lunch and, if you get lucky,
your waiter may be David Musson, a real blood relation to Edgar
Degas. Call 504-945-5635.
</P>
<P>
   At the Upperline Restaurant, visitors are greeted by large
paintings by Martin LaBorde, a local artist known for his whimsical
works. Each of the three works on the outside of the building
features Degas icons such as ballet dancers.
</P>
<P>
   The Degas menu spotlights specialties such as Crispy Soft Shell
Crab With Crawfish Mirliton Hash and Louisiana Hot Sauce Beurre
Blanc and Creole Tomatoes With Arugula, Goat Cheese and Pistou.
Call 504-891-9822.
</P>
<P>

(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Also in conjunction with the Degas exhibit, two hotels are
offering packages that include accommodations and exhibit tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Located at 500 Canal St., the Sheraton New Orleans provides two
exhibition tickets and a room for one night for rates starting at
$129. Call 877-663-3427.
</P>
<P>
   The Dauphine Orleans Hotel, located in the French Quarter at 415
Dauphine, offers a two-night package, which includes two tickets,
the ``Evening With Degas`` at the Hermann-Grima House and dinner at
Arnaud's, for $369. Call 800-521-7111.
</P>
<P>
   Destination Management provides a Degas in New Orleans package
that covers two-night's lodging, exhibit admission and a city tour
for fares starting at $129 per person (double occupancy).

DEGAS IN THE BIG EASY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PATRICIA C. JOHNSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Drawing, Edgar Degas said, is not ``what one sees,
but what one must make others see.''
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived in New Orleans the fall of 1872, the city was in
political, social and economic upheaval. In those years following
the Civil War, the population was less than 200,000, with power
concentrated in Northern hands; emancipation was nominal; and
corruption was endemic.
</P>
<P>
   But during his five-month stay, the soon-to-be-famous French
Impressionist saw little of the Crescent City and painted none of
it. Instead, he focused on his American Creole family.
</P>
<P>
   The smart and entrancing exhibition ``Degas and New Orleans: A
French Impressionist in America'' in the New Orleans Museum of Art
is a record of that visit.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived in the uneasy, segregated city in October 1872,
Degas was 38. Unlike his two brothers, who had moved to New Orleans
in pursuit of wealth, the artist was seeking respite after serving
in the National Guard during the Franco-Prussian War and resting
his weakening eyes (Degas went blind in one eye late in life).
</P>
<P>
   He lived withhis mother's brother, Michel Musson, and his family
in a fine two-story house with wrought-iron balconies and 14-foot
ceilings on Esplanade Avenue. Its light-filled rooms near Bayou St.
John insinuated themselves into the artist's portraits of cousins,
aunts, grandnieces and grandnephews, who came and went through the
lovely spaces.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition features 17 of the estimated 24 paintings Degas
created during his stay, which lasted through March 1873,
complemented with works that pre-date and follow it. A supplement
of material, such as photographs and correspondence between the
Musson and Degas families, and assorted objects, such as the sofa
from the Musson living room featured in one of the paintings,
creates a fresh context.
</P>
<P>
   A visitor can discern the flow of the artist's life and gain
insight into such characters as his cousin Estelle, a frequent
model and an unwitting protagonist in the family saga.
</P>
<P>
   Artistically, Degas was at a crossroads, and here, too, the
exhibit reveals transformations as subtle as they are crucial.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of it all is ``A Cotton Office in New Orleans''
(The Cotton Exchange, 1873) a painting whose modest size belies its
pivotal role in the artist's development and the impact it had on
the public.
</P>
<P>
   In this stark interior scene, Degas explores spaces and the
diagonal composition that will characterize the revolutionary work
to come. He limited his palette to black, cream and ochre tones,
devoting his potent powers of observation to render 14 distinctive
portraits and a dynamic environment in rich variety of brushwork.
</P>
<P>
   Musson sits in the front of the picture, left of center, his
legs cut off by the edge of the canvas. He is studying the sample
of cotton in his hand. On the left edge, Degas' brother Achille
leans casually against the window. His other brother, Rene, sits
dead center of the picture, his legs stretched before him as he
reads the Daily Picayune. Balancing this mid-ground is a
shirt-sleeved John Livaudais, the company clerk, who stands by the
right edge of the picture, examining the ledgers on the desk.
</P>
<P>
   Details such as the basket of trash, planted in the same plane
as Musson, and the texture of the cotton samples on the table
surrounded by potential buyers, complete the scene in which the hum
of activity is nearly audible. Degas finished this painting after
his return to Paris and entered it in the first Impressionist
exhibition in 1874, where it was acquired by the museum in Pau.
</P>
<P>
   The marvelous articulation of both bodies and space in ``The
Cotton Office'' is suggested in another composition, ``The Song
Rehearsal.'' This interior is believed to be of the Musson home on
Esplanade, where two women _ the one on the right presumably
Estelle _ entertain themselves and the unresolved figure at the
piano.
</P>
<P>
   Individual portraits are abundant in this exhibit curated for
NOMA by Gail Feignebaum. Sketches and finished paintings describe
the artist and his family for their own sake, but also as character
studies and figures for larger compositions. Drawings of Degas'
sisters Therese and Marguerite accompany his iconic ``Self-Portrait
in a Soft Hat'' (1857) in the introductory gallery, the assurance
of his line conveying precise likenesses and as well as suggesting
personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Estelle, the most frequent subject, was Musson's daughter and
the wife of Degas' brother Rene. We meet her first in a group
portrait Degas drew in shades of gray watercolor and charcoal in
1865. Degas' aunt is seated on an armchair with her daughter
Desiree standing to her left, right arm extended on the mantle, and
Estelle seated on the floor at her feet. Estelle had been recently
widowed, and the three women were in Paris escaping the Civil War.
Estelle's eventual blindness is evident in her wayward gaze that is
also filled with sadness.
</P>
<P>
   We find her time and again in the New Orleans pictures, after
she's married Rene. In one especially beautiful painting, the
pregnant Estelle, wearing a black dress, stands by a table
arranging flowers in a vase. In his inimitable manner, Degas
combines large areas of indeterminate space _ the brushy
transparency of the brown wall behind the figure and the liquid
green of the window at her side _ with carefully described details.
In this thoughtful picture, the sharp focus on the red gladioli and
white roselike blooms in the center draw attention to the delicate
hand that arranges the flowers, which in turn draws attention to
her sightless, gentle face.

 &HT;    Now you see him, now you don't
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The cover of Robbie Williams' first solo album is a snapshot of
the saucy British popster with his face half-hidden by a turtleneck
sweater. It's as apt a visual metaphor as any for the music within,
which sells the singer as generic pop product while obscuring much
of his personality.
</P>
<P>
   After splitting from the British teen-dream group Take That
(``Back for Good''), Williams set about changing his image. His
evolution from bland pinup to puckish rocker has earned him
incredible success in Britain, where he regularly tops the charts
and sells out stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ego Has Landed'' attempts to sell Williams to America. As
such, it plays like a catalog of previously proven, radio-friendly
formulas. ``Lazy Days'' kicks off the album with a warmed-over
Oasis hook. The ballad, ``No Regrets,'' sounds like George Michael
at his most moony. ``Win Some Lose Some'' pilfers its bouncy beat
from John Waite's bag of tricks.
</P>
<P>
   Lost in all the pop cliches and slick production is the
memorably daft jokester who punctuates live performances with
off-color anecdotes, bigger-than-life gestures and jittery,
aggressive dancing. Only the arch rocker ``Let Me Entertain You''
and the delightfully irreverent ``Jesus in a Camper Van'' offer any
hint of the devil within.

 &HT;    Body and soul: Two approaches to the spiritual
 &HT;    By Judith Green
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Spiritual fodder in music these days comes in two varieties:
Christian pop and New Age float. Whatever happened to music with
the religious vigor of Martin Luther, striding up the steps of
Wittenberg Cathedral to nail those 95 theses to the door? Instead,
we have ``The Prayer Cycle: A Choral Symphony in Nine Movements,''
by Jonathan Elias and a staff of electronic elves. Never in this
world did Alanis Morissette sing (in Hungarian, yet) in the same
room as James Taylor, Linda Ronstadt, the American Boychoir or any
of the other 10 classical, world-music and pop artists summoned to
contribute to this event. Everything was put together from
separately recorded tracks by some guys twiddling a bunch of knobs,
and the music sounds exactly that bloodless.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, there's an unpretentious little album by the San
Antonio Vocal Arts Ensemble of music written by European and Latin
American composers to honor the appearance in 1531 of the Virgin of
Guadalupe to a Nahua Indian called Juan Diego. SAVAE is the real
thing: flesh-and-blood singers and musicians, performing works from
the cathedral archives of Mexico City by a Guatemalan Indian
composer, Tomas Pascual (circa 1595-1635), and Don Antonio
Valeriano, the Spanish priest who took down Juan Diego's story. The
songs are as simple and wholesome as bread, and as nourishing to
the body and soul.

</P>
<P>
   ``A Good Day for the Blues''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Brown. Bullseye. 12 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Recorded in a New Orleans studio, the 70-year-old R&AMP;B legend is
in superb form on her latest outing. With Brown's experience, she's
able to seamlessly explore the tricky territory between blues and
jazz with ease. Longtime players, including tenor saxophonist Bill
Easley and Hammond organist Bobby Forrester, give Brown enough room
to work, too. Brown's three-minute improvisational riff on ``Can't
Stand a Broke Man'' showcases her trademark wit, while the hurt in
the singer's voice on ``A Lover Is Forever'' is just as convincing.
The album's only misstep is the singer's decision to cover R.
Kelly's ``I Believe I Can Fly.'' Brown has earned her place in R&AMP;B
history; Kelly has barely left the nest.

   ``Requiem''
</P>
<P>
   Branford Marsalis Quartet. Columbia. 8 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, this lively, sure-footed session would merit notice
as saxophonist Branford Marsalis' most happening album in years.
But the death of longtime Marsalis associate Kenny Kirkland, not
long after making the recording, lends the occasion a bittersweet
vibe. Marsalis wisely chose not to spruce up what mostly amounts to
first takes. This not only leaves the late pianist's sparkling
improvisations intact, it guarantees the sometimes feverish
spontaneity that's the heartbeat of any great working band. The
well-rounded set emphasizes graceful, blues-limned balladry (``A
Thousand Autumns'') and Mingus-inspired gospel grooves (``16th St.
Baptist Church''), with fierce, knotty sax solos and fluid group
dynamics compensating for the unavoidable pastel tones of Marsalis'
forays on soprano. The highlight is a new version of ``Lykief,''
which launches a lilting theme (sounding a little like something
Ornette Coleman would cook up) into hyperspace and back again, and
features the versatile Kirkland in vigorous, free-flowing mode.

   ``A Day in the Life''

<P>
   Eric Benet. Warner Bros. 13 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   The ``Sensitivity'' Eric Benet displayed on his 1996 debut may
lead listeners to his second album, but upon arrival, the trail
goes kind of cold. The airy R&AMP;B singer who had trouble garnering
attention his first time out is going about his love songs a bit
differently this time. Instead of pretty paeans to the opposite
sex, he opens with an order to ``hike up that skirt'' (``That's
Just My Way''). Then on ``Something Real'' he borrows, strangely,
from gangster rappers Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg's ``Nothing but
a `G' Thing.'' But just before you toss Benet aside as another
artist whose bravado is not only unbelievable, but distancing, in
he comes, roses in hand, warm Hammond organs prominent, ready to
``Love the Hurt Away.''

 &HT;    BIG BUSINESSES STARTS $2 MILLION, 10-STATE MATH PLAN
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Eighth graders in 10 states will take similar math
courses and the same annual math test under a $2 million initiative
announced Wednesday by some of the nation's biggest businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Eighth grade was targeted because in math tests administered in
41 countries, American eighth-graders ranked 28th, behind countries
with far fewer resources, such as Thailand and Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighth grade is the turning point where our kids either slide
further into mediocrity or _ as we hope _ they rise to world-class
performance,'' said Louis V. Gerstner Jr., chairman and chief
executive officer of IBM Corp. Joining IBM in financing the
experiment are the Procter &AMP; Gamble Co., the Boeing Co., Eastman
Kodak Co., Prudential, and State Farm Insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New
Hampshire, North Carolina, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin were
the 10 states that signed up for the partnership with the
sponsoring organization. Known as Achieve, it is a nonpartisan
organization formed after the Education Summit of 1996 by governors
and big companies.
</P>
<P>
   The $2 million will pay the states to coordinate efforts by
local and state educators to define common standards, instructional
materials, teacher-training needs and tests. The businesses hope
this ``bottom-up'' approach will satisfy the objections of some
local school officials to President Clinton's proposal for
voluntary ``top-down'' national standards, Gerstner said.
</P>
<P>
   The new math teaching aids and training would be used in the
2000-2001 school year, and a trial run at administering the
10-state test would be conducted in the spring of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well, most school districts in most of the 10 states
would be using the new curriculum and tests routinely by the time
today's fourth-graders are in eight grade.
</P>
<P>
   While 49 states have adopted academic standards for math, and
most of them conduct statewide tests, the tests and their grading
vary wildly. In some states, 80 percent of the students pass, and
in others, more than half fail.
</P>
<P>
   William Schmidt, a nationally known math researcher, said that
most states include algebra and geometry in the descriptions of
their eighth-grade math courses. ``But,'' he added, ``the bulk of
what is asked on our eight-grade math tests is content that other
countries expect 5th and 6th graders _ or younger students _ to
master.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not good enough for companies like Boeing, where half the
217,000 employees have college degrees and the others need to
understand the mathematics in engineering instructions, said the
aerospace firm's chairman and chief executive officer, Philip M.
Condit.
</P>
<P>
   Condit said businesses are helping the states unite behind
tough, identical standards for math courses because it is cheaper
than the two major alternatives - teaching math to all new
employees or moving operations to a country with higher standards
in math.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the participating states will save money, since they
will be sharing the high expenses of developing new standards,
curricula and tests with each other, said Gov. Tommy Thompson of
Wisconsin. He said developing one of the statewide tests in
Wisconsin cost his state $10 million.

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD GLADSTONE 
 Includes illustration. 
 Copyright 1999 Bernard Gladstone 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: We have a brick house that is over 50 years old and some of
the mortar joints have started to crumble with sections even
falling out. I've been told by a bricklayer that the joints need to
be repaired by tuck pointing. The price he quoted was way too high
for us to afford. But since most of the cost would be for
time-consuming labor, I thought I would like to try doing the job
myself. Are there any special tools or techniques I need to know
about that will make the job easier or more effective?
</P>
<P>
   A: If there is a great deal of tuck pointing to do then it would
be advisable to buy several specialized tools: a tuck pointing
trowel, a tuck pointing chisel and a hawk. You will also need a
small hand-held sledge hammer or other hammer suitable for striking
metal. Use the hammer and chisel to remove all of the old mortar
that is cracking or crumbling down to a depth of at least half an
inch. Brush out debris and dust, then clean with a light spray from
a hose. Mix up some tuck pointing mortar and put a large glob onto
the surface of the hawk, then while holding the hawk against the
surface of the brick, use the tuck pointing trowel to pack the
mortar tightly into the recessed joint between the bricks as shown
here. Before the mortar sets up completely smooth off and tool the
surface of the new mortar joint to match the existing mortar joints
by using either a special brick jointing tool, or the point of a
small triangular trowel.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We recently purchased a house that has vinyl-coated aluminum
siding on the outside. I know that aluminum siding can be repainted
and have read how to do this. But I'm not sure if this also applies
to vinyl-coated (also called vinyl-clad) aluminum siding. If so, is
there a specific type of paint that should be used?
</P>
<P>
   A: I believe that what you are referring to is aluminum siding
that has been factory coated with some type of paint or a finish
that is similar to paint. If so this can be successfully painted
over with a good grade of latex house paint _ preferably one that
specifies on the label that it is suitable for use on aluminum
siding. However, if your siding is actually coated with some type
of plastic coating, then it might be best to check with the
manufacturer of that siding. If this is not possible, test the
paint on one small area before going ahead with the whole job.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We have a fireplace in the basement and one in the family
room directly over this. Every time we build a fire in the basement
fireplace smoke seems to fill up the basement. Can this be because
of the way the two fireplaces are situated directly above each
other?
</P>
<P>
   A: Each fireplace should have its own flue. If both share the
same flue, then this could definitely be causing a problem. You
should never have a single chimney flue venting two fireplaces, or
one fireplace and a furnace. If one of the fireplaces was added
after the house was built and the contractor tapped into or
connected up to the same flue, that could be the problem (it could
also be a possible fire hazard). If there are separate flues for
each chimney, then there may be a structural problem with the
chimney such as leaks in the flue lining, or a partial blockage in
the one going to the basement. This should be checked out by a
professional chimney sweep or a contractor who services fireplaces.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When it rains heavily I get water trickling in through cracks
in one of my basement walls directly under one of the windows.
There is a hill behind this wall and the window is below ground
level with a recessed well around it. Should I patch the cracks in
the concrete wall under the window, or should I put down drain tile
to carry the ground water away?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think patching the cracks will solve your problem.
Waterproofing the outside of this wall and installing drain tile
along the footing would be the most effective, but this is
expensive. You might try diverting the ground water that runs off
the hill by digging a trench uphill of the house and parallel to
it. This should be at least 10 feet away from the foundation and
about 12 inches deep and 12-18 inches wide. Fill this trench with
gravel and make sure the trench extends past the house on each
side. It should also slope downward at each end so that water can
flow out of the ends easily. Water coming down off the hill will be
caught in the trench and diverted around each side of the house
instead of running against the basement wall.

<P>
   By Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   ``You've Got Mail'' (PG)
</P>
<P>
   Ernst Lubitsch's beloved 1940 film ``The Shop Around the
Corner'' hits the Internet age, giving director and co-writer Nora
Ephron a chance to reunite Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan in a story ideal
for their charms.
</P>
<P>
   Hanks plays Joe Fox, scion of a bookstore-chain business that's
inexorably wiping out mom-and-pop shops. Such as the one owned by
Kathleen Kelly (Ryan), a children's book nook called, yes, the Shop
Around the Corner. She's carrying on a romantic e-mail
correspondence with a man she knows only as ``dear friend.'' Even
if you haven't seen the original movie, you can probably guess the
rest. Yep _ unbeknownst to either party, Joe and Kathleen, who
openly spar over the buffet table at West Side parties, are each
other's electronic sweethearts.
</P>
<P>
   The movie give us a glossy, storybook Manhattan of clean streets
and cozy, well-decorated apartments, plus a lively supporting cast
including Steve Zahn, Jean Stapleton, Greg Kinnear and
scene-stealer Parker Posey. Grade: B

   &QR;  ``Babe: Pig in the City'' (G) _ This little piggy has a
sequel. But while most of the main players are reunited, some of
the magic has worn off. The movie welcomes us back to the world of
talking Babe and his farm friends, plus the farming couple the
Hoggetts (James Cromwell and Magda Szubanski). But the sequel sends
Babe and the Missus to the big city for a series of misadventures
that fill the screen with all sorts of talking animals. Problem is,
Babe himself gets lost in the crowd. Even so, it's visually one of
the liveliest, loveliest movies of 1998, giving us the sort of
fantasy metropolis any bright-eyed kid would love. Grade: B -

<P>
   &QR;  ``Lilies'' (R) _ Directed by John Greyson, who gave us the
spectacularly, um, unique AIDS musical ``Zero Patience'' a few
years back, ``Lilies'' is a lush celebration of young love and
melodrama. Drunk on its own romanticism, it combines Tennessee
Williams, Jean Genet, ``Marat/Sade'' and the more homoerotic
elements of the Catholic church. It's a triumph more of style than
substance, as an aging bishop in 1952 is compelled to watch a cast
of prisoners perform a stage version, telling of the cleric's own
young betrayal of two teen male friends who fell in love. All the
roles are played by men, resulting in a Brent Carver's beautiful
performance as one boy's deluded mother. Grade: B

 &HT;    Movies with a place in their heart for Mom
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   M is for the many movies she gives us.
</P>
<P>
   There are good moms (Irma P. Hall in ``Soul Food'') and bad
(Anjelica Huston in ``The Grifters''). Mysterious (Faye Dunaway in
``Chinatown'') and downright spooky (Piper Laurie in ``Carrie'').
Funny (Mildred Natwick in ``Barefoot in the Park'') and frightening
(Bette Davis in ``The Little Foxes'').
</P>
<P>
   There's a video to go with every kind of mother. So for Mother's
Day, here are a few favorites:
</P>
<P>
   ``Places in the Heart'' (1984).
</P>
<P>
   Sally Field won her second Oscar as a resourceful Texas woman
who, after the shooting death of her husband, gathers the strength
to save her family farm.
</P>
<P>
   Her best mommy moments: Calling the kids together for the
pull-no-punches talk that starts, ``Somethin's happened to your
Pa''; fearlessly heading into tornadic winds to find her son.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Elvis _ The Movie'' (1979).
</P>
<P>
   Shelley Winters plays a dead-on, tired queen mum to the King of
Rock 'n' Roll (Kurt Russell).
</P>
<P>
   Her ultimate mommy moment: Silently sitting in all-glitter
Graceland and watching a big, faux-snow-drenched mechanical
Christmas tree go 'round and 'round.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Manchurian Candidate'' (1962).
</P>
<P>
   Angela Lansbury plays the manipulative matriarch of a
politically astute and opportunistic family. She's diabolical with
her brainwashed son (Laurence Harvey).
</P>
<P>
   Her worst mommy moment: Heck, she's nothing but evil.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Great Santini'' (1980).
</P>
<P>
   Blythe Danner (she's Gwyneth Paltrow's mother in real life)
struggles against the inevitable family dysfunction wrought by her
semi-psychotic husband (Oscar nominee Robert Duvall).
</P>
<P>
   Her memorable mommy moment: Her voice-over as her troubled high
school son (Michael O'Keefe) reads her loving note on his birthday.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Lion in Winter'' (1968).
</P>
<P>
   Katharine Hepburn is one fiery wench and an Oscar winner
opposite Peter O'Toole in this remarkably acted tale of British
royal treachery.
</P>
<P>
   Among her manipulative mommy moments: Bargaining with her trio
of loutish grown boys in an attempt to land her favorite (Anthony
Hopkins) the throne.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?'' (1967).
</P>
<P>
   Even though she won the Oscar here, too, it's not Katharine
Hepburn who's the most effective mom in this interracial love
story. It's Beah Richards.
</P>
<P>
   Her indelible mommy moment: Explaining love to her son (Sidney
Poitier).
</P>
<P>
   ``Mother'' (1996).
</P>
<P>
   Therapy begins by looking at Ma. This is Albert Brooks' often
hilarious treatise on a man coming home _ and connecting with his
mom (Debbie Reynolds) _ to understand himself.
</P>
<P>
   Among her great mommy moments: She makes salads to last all week
_ and freezes them.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``To Kill a Mockingbird'' (1963).
</P>
<P>
   You're right. Mom's not seen in this movie. Atticus Finch's
(Oscar winner Gregory Peck) wife died four years before this noble
story begins.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Finch is still a remarkable presence in one of the best
movies ever made. It comes after Atticus' kids, Jem (Phillip
Alford) and Scout (Mary Badham), have been tucked into bed in
separate rooms. In the still of the darkening night, they lay their
heads down on pillows and do what many young siblings do before
sleep overtakes them. They talk, trying to make sense of their
world.
</P>
<P>
   Scout: ``How old was I when Mama died?''
</P>
<P>
   Jem: ``Two.''
</P>
<P>
   Scout: ``How old were you?''
</P>
<P>
   Jem: ``Six.''
</P>
<P>
   Scout: ``Old as I am now?''
</P>
<P>
   Jem: ``Ah-huh.''
</P>
<P>
   Scout: ``Was Mama pretty?''
</P>
<P>
   Jem: ``Uh-huh.''
</P>
<P>
   (The camera pans to Atticus, sitting on the porch swing, his
head lowered, as his children's voices hang in the night.)
</P>
<P>
   Scout: ``Was Mama nice?''
</P>
<P>
   Jem: ``Ah-huh.''
</P>
<P>
   Scout: ``Did you love her?''
</P>
<P>
   Jem: ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Scout: ``Did I love her?''
</P>
<P>
   Jem: ``Ah-huh.''
</P>
<P>
   Scout: ``Do you miss her?''
</P>
<P>
   Jem: ``Uh-huh.''

group that sprang up several years ago to provide solace and social
life to farm people. By Pam Belluck.
</P>
<P>
   CALLENDAR-HOUSE (Tivoli, N.Y.) _ A decade ago, Pierre Moulin and
his partner, Pierre (Peter) LeVec _ the couple known far and wide
as Pierre Deux, as much for their joyous Provencal style as for the
colorful French cottons they sold at their fabric and antiques
emporia _ bought this late-18-century Hudson River house and its 47
acres, and started inviting friends, relatives and strangers for
parties and teas, and concerts in the old emerald-green carriage
house north of the main house. Now, with great regret, Moulin, 72,
has decided to part with Callendar House, and he has spent a mellow
Saturday afternoon recounting the highlights of his decade there.

<P>
   AMERICAN-DESIGN (New York) _ In the American Century exhibition
that recently opened at the Whitney Museum of American Art, the
first five decades of the 20th century are represented by nearly
1,000 artworks, a variety of cultural artifacts, like film clips,
plus a few dozen carefully culled examples of the decorative arts
and industrial design. Mostly, the design objects are used to
underscore points made by the art, as if to say, ``The artists
don't lie; this is how the world truly looked.'' By Karrie Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
   LIVING-IN-CELEBRATION (Celebration, Fla.) _ Less than a week
after we moved to this new town being built by the Walt Disney Co.,
a neighbor dropped by to chat and the topic turned to children. One
of the great things about living here, the neighbor said, is that
the kids will have so many adults watching over them. We were
somewhat taken aback, thinking that perhaps Celebration would be
just a little too neighborly for us, but as we conclude our second
year here, we have come to see a measure of wisdom in that
neighbor's point of view. By Frantz and Catherine Collins.
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-HOMES-FIRE (Carpinteria, Calif.) _ Splendor among the
oaks, especially in the secretive canyons winding up into the

nature here must also defend itself from her tinderbox. By Joseph

3 U.S. MUSEUMS TO EXHIBIT TREASURE FROM ANCIENT CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GERALD D. ADAMS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Climaxing more than seven years of diplomatic
effort, a blockbuster collection of Chinese archaeological
treasures will be exhibited at three U.S. museums this year an
next.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Golden Age of Chinese Archaeology,'' featuring a
collection 248 pieces that are among the earliest ever known, will
go first to the National Gallery in Washington, then to the Houston
Museum of Art before ending at the Asian Art Museum in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The artifacts include gold, silver, jade, bronze, porcelain and
textile items, some of which date back thousands of years to the
Stone and Bronze ages. All have been gathered from archaeological
discoveries made in graves during the last quarter-century.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show will be truly fabulous ... all these items are
utterly staggering,'' Emily Sano, director of the Asian Art Museum,
said during Tuesday's announcement. The exhibit will be on display
in San Francisco for 12 weeks beginning June 17, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit in this country _ following more than seven years of
high-level negotiations between art and diplomatic officials of
China and the United States _ would mark the first time that all
the works have been gathered into a single exhibit and sent abroad,
said Michael Knight, the Asian Art Museum's curator.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are national treasures whose value is so great that I
cannot believe the Chinese are allowing them to go out of the
country,'' Knight said.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington opening will take place in September. It will
then go to Houston before arriving in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The immense exhibit will require the Asian Art Museum, located
in Golden Gate Park, to displace every work on the first floor to
create sufficient space.
</P>
<P>
   It includes ``some first-rate, very interesting materials,''
said David Keightley, a history professor emeritus at the
University of California at Berkeley and a specialist in early
Chinese Bronze Age works.
</P>
<P>
   Among objects due to be exhibited are Neolithic (late Stone) Age
jade ritual objects and jewelry estimated to be 5,000 to 6,000
years old, some gathered from digs near Shanghai, others from
Liaoning province in northeastern China.
</P>
<P>
   Dating to the Bronze Age are a series of life-size bronze
figures from Sichuan, which Sano said indicated ``a completely
different bronze culture'' from any previously known.
</P>
<P>
   The bronze works, which are from the Shang Dynasty, are about
3,000 years old and include what Knight described as ``bizarre
masks with eyes that stick out from the head on five-inch stems.''

   Both Sano and Knight raved about the 2,000-year-old Xi'an
warriors in the collection. Made of clay, they date to the first
Chinese dynasty, the Qin, and include a group of life-size horses
as well as a chariot.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike previous Chinese shows that have been seen in San
Francisco, the Golden Age focuses on archaeological finds made
since the beginning of Communist rule in China 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Besides prehistoric items, the collection will also include
works dating from the Qin period, the Western Han, Northern Wei,
Northern Qi and Tang dynasties.

lineup of stories and datelines could change.) &QL;

</P>
<P>
   TORNADO &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY _ As Oklahoma City counts its dead and injured,
devastated neighborhoods slowly begin to open, allowing the
survivors to see what became of their worldly possessions. By JACK
DOUGLAS JR. and ANDREW BACKOVER. Story will move in ``a'' general
news category. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TORNADO-RECONSTRUCTION &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ One of the first places hit by Monday's devastating
tornado was Bridge Creek, a tiny town between Chickasha and
Oklahoma City. Eleven people died in Bridge Creek as the twister
raked through with winds of more than 260 mph. Forty miles away in
Oklahoma City and its suburbs, residents scrambled to get out of
the way of the approaching storm. Most made it, although their
homes were flattened. Others weren't so lucky. On Wednesday,
Oklahoma City tried to salvage something from its second disaster
in four years. A reconstruction of the past 48 hours. By MITCHELL
SCHNURMAN. Story will move in ``a'' general news category. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TORNADO-DEAD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY _ The 38 dead in the Oklahoma City area included a
family of four, aunts, uncles, cousins, those who ran and those who
couldn't. A series of vignettes about those who didn't make it. By
DEANNA BOYD and REBECA RODRIGUEZ. Story will move in ``a'' general
news category. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TORNADO-DEJA VU &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY _ Residents of Oklahoma City may be feeling a
collective sense of deja vu. It all seems to have happened before :
the sirens, the destruction, the grieving. This time, in the midst
of the city's second disaster in four years, residents are using
lessons learned from the terrorist bombing of the Murrah Federal
Building on April 19, 1995. By MILES MOFFEIT. Story will move in
``a'' general news category. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TORNADO-HOUSING &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY _ As many did in 1995 after the bombing of the
federal building, the people of Oklahoma City are opening their
doors to strangers in need. Apartment complexes with vacancies are
offering shelter. The University of Oklahoma is opening its dorms.
Those whose homes escaped damage are inviting strangers to bunk
with them as long as necessary. Story will move in ``a'' general
news category. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TORNADO-MIDWEST CITY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MIDWEST CITY, Okla _ Midwest City, a densely populated Oklahoma
City suburb and home of Tinker Air Force Base, took it in the gut
Monday. Reports say that at least one home, and the family of four
that inhabited it, are completely gone, swept away by the killer
tornado. By JENNIFER AUTREY. Story will move in ``a'' general news
category. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TORNADO-MULHALL &QL;

   MULHALL, Okla. _ In Mulhall, a town of about 200 several miles
north of Oklahoma City, only one in 10 homes reportedly escaped
damage. By BILL HANNA. Story will move in ``a'' general news

<P>
   TORNADO-ANIMALS &QL;

and cows. By BETSY BLANEY. Story will move in ``a'' general news

   GOLIAD-MEXICAN HERITAGE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GOLIAD, Texas _ Estella Zermeno's home is a small, neatly kept,
bicultural family shrine. There is a hand-colored photo of her
seven brothers, each in his U.S. military uniform. There are vivid
photos of nieces and nephews who are firefighters and police
officers _ all public servants. And, there are the older, faded
photos of Mexican washerwomen and dark-skinned men wearing stiff
white collars. They, too, are family. By ART CHAPMAN. Story will

<P>
   CORPORATE ZEN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ As if you didn't have enough to do every day at work,
now comes this: Enlightenment under fluorescent lights. Nirvana at
the budget meeting. It's not as unlikely as it sounds.
Centuries-old Eastern thought and relaxation techniques may be the
answers to the various ills of the working life, where stress,
jealousy, greed and various deadly sins often abound. That's
according to Massachusetts author Llama Surya Das, who says the
workplace is one of the most rewarding places to practice the
principles of Tibetan Buddhism. By JESSIE MILLIGAN. Story will move

   DEGAS-NEW ORLEANS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ The only major French impressionist artist to
visit the New World, Edgar Degas made a personally and artistically
important visit to his mother's native city of New Orleans in late
1872, during which time he painted a group of memorable images
included in a landmark show at the New Orleans Museum of Art. By
JANET TYSON. Story will move in ``e'' entertainment category &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-FERMAN-COLUMN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ Stride piano flourished 60 years ago in Harlem via
such giants as Fats Waller and Willie ``The Lion'' Smith and
subsequently faded into obscurity. These days, one of the leading
practitioners of the form is Judy Carmichael, a blond Californian
who fell in love with the music in her 20s and has since recorded
seven CDs and toured as far away as China. She talks with pop music
critic Dave Ferman about her love of music and the need for
preserving the history of jazz. By DAVE FERMAN. Story will move in

<P>
   FOOD-CENTURY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ In the 1920s, Prohibition limped along, while
speakeasies and organized crime did a roaring business. Another
look at developments in food and dining over the past century. By
BEVERLY BUNDY. Story will move in ``d'' food and dining category &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOOD-CHAPMAN-COLUMN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ There is no more holy subject in Texas than barbecue.
Yes, you could say Friday-night football ranks high, but even those
games are preceded by a barbecue. The same goes for the college
game and what little is left of the professional sport. No,
barbecue is the energy source that drives the state. It is as
important as oil and gas. Politics cannot be conducted in Texas
without barbecue. Anything worth doing is worth doing over a
barbecue. And if you barbecue in Texas, you use beef. That is going
to make ``Barbecue America, A Pilgrimage in Search of America's
Best Barbecue'' (Time-Life Books, $24.95) a difficult sell south of
the Red River. By ART CHAPMAN. Story will move in ``d'' food and
dining category &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE BEER NUT-COLUMN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ Growing up Catholic has its share of weird memories:
itchy little scapulars worn around the neck during Lent that
scraped tender young skin raw. Or trying to accumulate enough
plenary indulgences for a visa to that strange, murky bus stop on
the road to heaven known as Purgatory. Not to mention a lifetime's
worth of guilt, remorse and eternal damnation just for one lousy
spring break's worth of impure thoughts, words and deeds. But like
the pope said, ``Hey, eternity ain't easy, pal.'' Or words to that
effect. On the other hand, Catholics have St. Arnold, the patron
saint of brewers. By BRIAN MELTON. Story will move in ``d'' food
and dining category &QL;

<P>
   THOMPSON-COLUMN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ Cut through the partisan rhetoric and ideological
claptrap surrounding the recent murderous rampages by schoolkids
and the message from these folks is clear. Each side is blaming the
recent killings in places such as Littleton, Colo., and Jonesboro,
Ark., on a precious freedom guaranteed by the Constitution _ either
freedom of speech or the right to bear arms. By BILL THOMPSON.

UNDATED: in metal cans. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   1921: The first White Castle hamburger stand opens in Wichita,
Kan. The white of the stones suggested cleanliness, the castle
facade suggested stability. The little burgers are 5 cents apiece
and are marketed with the slogan ``Buy 'em by the sack.'' The first
paper napkins come on the market in 1925, and the White Castle
locations followed that by developing a folding paper hat that
could be changed often. ``Programmic'' architecture becomes the
rage in restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   1921: The American Birth Control League (later Planned
Parenthood) is founded by Margaret Sanger and Maryware Dennett.
</P>
<P>
   1921: Table-salt makers iodize salt with potassium iodide to
prevent goiter, an enlarged thyroid, but the process is not
mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   1922: Two Canadians isolate the hormone from canine pancreatic
juices to save the life of a child dying of diabetes. This will
lead to the first commercial insulin _ the first treatment for
diabetes other than diet limitations.
</P>
<P>
   1923: The May issue of Women's Home Companion publishes an
article that includes the lines, ``With the revolution in clothes
has come a revolution in our attitude toward avoirdupois. Once
weight was an asset: Now it's a liability, both physical and
esthetic.''
</P>
<P>
   1923: Sanka Decaffeinated Coffee is introduced.
</P>
<P>
   1924: Tijuana restaurant owner (and Italian immigrant) Caesar
Cardini comes up with the showy, tableside-prepared Caesar salad.
Later, the International Society of Epicures in Paris votes the
dish ``the greatest recipe to originate from the Americas in 50
years.''
</P>
<P>
   1924: Wolf Brand Chili goes into big-time production.
</P>
<P>
   1925: The average American homemaker prepares all her food at
home. By 1965, 75 percent to 90 percent of the food she uses has
undergone some sort of factory processing.
</P>
<P>
   1925: Postum Cereal Co., now General Foods, buys the rights to
Jell-O, invented in 1897 by Pearl Bixby Wait of LeRoy, N.Y. In the
late 1800s, cooks were moving away from heavy desserts by making
gelatin dishes from dried sheets of prepared unflavored gelatin.
This was a laborious process.
</P>
<P>
   1925: Using cars as a dining venue begins in the 1920s. Merging
the popularity of cars and soda fountains, pharmacies like the
Highland Park in Dallas hired male runners to carry ice cream and
soda to vehicles lined up at the curb.
</P>
<P>
   1926: Milk Duds are introduced.
</P>
<P>
   1926: Cobb salad, a chopped salad made with avocado, lettuce,
celery, tomato, bacon, chicken, chives, hard-boiled egg, watercress
and Roquefort cheese, is created at the Brown Derby in Los Angeles
by owner Bob Cobb to use up leftovers. The Brown Derby was one of
many examples of restaurant ``programmic architecture'' springing
up along the nation's roads.
</P>
<P>
   1926: The Russian Tea Room in New York City is opened by members
of the Russian Imperial Ballet. It becomes a meeting place for
Russian artists, writers and musicians as well as America's
show-business crowd.
</P>
<P>
   1926: The Paris Coffee Shop opens in Fort Worth with 12 stools
and a luncheon counter. Today, the restaurant is across from the
original site on Magnolia Street.
</P>
<P>
   1927: Pez is introduced in Austria as a peppermint breath mint
for smokers. In 1948, the plastic dispensers are introduced. In
1948, the United States begins to manufacture the brand and market
it to children.
</P>
<P>
   1927: General Electric introduces the revolutionary monitor-top
refrigerator. The motor was sealed in a case that perched on top of
the appliance, and it required no maintenance. As production picked
up, the price fell from $600 for the clunky 1920 model to an
average of $90 by 1940. But until after World War II, many people
used iceboxes, which had to be constantly reloaded with ice and the
trays of water underneath discarded. Even $90 was a lot of money.
``No more worry while away,'' an early ad stated. ``The cost of
spoiled and wasted foods no longer interferes _ electric
refrigeration keeps them fresh and pure for days. Go away when you
like _ return to find the most delicate foods in perfect
condition.''
</P>
<P>
   1927: Kool-Aid is introduced.
</P>
<P>
   1928: Sliced bread is introduced.
</P>
<P>
   1928: The Bureau of Prohibition reports that nearly 70,000
doctors are using alcohol prescription books. Doctors could
prescribe 1/2 pint per patient every 10 days, but they couldn't use
more than 100 prescriptions (one book) every 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   1928: Broccoli is new to the United States and leads to the New
Yorker cartoon by Carl Rose (with a caption by E.B. White) that has
a young child saying, ``I say it's spinach, and I say to hell with
it.''

IN THE 1920S, SPEAKEASIES AND ORGANIZED CRIME DID A ROARING
BUSINESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEVERLY BUNDY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Roaring '20s began on a down note and ended in a funeral
dirge. But in between, much of America had itself a grand old time.
</P>
<P>
   Prohibitionists, busy in America since early in the 19th
century, finally got their way in 1919 when the Volstead Act was
ratified, making it illegal to produce, sell or distribute
alcoholic beverages.
</P>
<P>
   What brought the country to the banning of evil rum was an
unhappy coincidence of hard industrial conditions in cities that
drove many to drink heavily, a policy of saloons offering ``free
lunches'' so that workers would ring up big liquor sales, and a
turning against immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   The last is particularly odd in that Italians and Jews had the
lowest rates of alcoholism in the country. The German immigrants,
from a tradition of brewing, were unfortunate victims of World War
I memories.
</P>
<P>
   But much of Prohibition was window dressing. At the 1920
Democratic convention, delegates drank illegal whiskey catered free
by San Francisco's mayor. Journalist and curmudgeon H.L. Mencken
wrote, ``Even in the most remote country districts, there is
absolutely no place in which any man who desires to drink alcohol
cannot get it.''
</P>
<P>
   And organized crime came into its own. Chicago bootlegger John
Torrio made so much money from 1920-1924 that he retired to Italy
in 1925 with a fortune of $30 million. Al Capone was Torrio's
successor.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants, usually dependent on wine and liquor sales, closed
by the droves. Many installed soda fountains to draw customers.
And, of course, the speak-easy was born. These portable parties
were epitomized by the operations run by Mary Louise Cecilia
``Texas'' Guinan. Although often arrested for running speak-easies,
Guinan gigged the police by wearing a gold police whistle around
her neck, and greeted her customers with the phrase ``Hello,
sucker.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite these disquieting developments on the crime front, the
business of America's business was chugging along. In 1924, the
number of cars produced by the four leading European car makers
equaled only 11 percent of the amount of autos manufactured in
America. The working class could have the cars, the middle class
was starting to take airplanes. America was the economic power of
the world, and its people were feeling their oats.
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration Act of 1924 restricted immigration from Asia,
Latin America, Africa and Eastern Europe, and Americans were into
being Americans. Without an influx of new immigrants, the earlier
arrivals were a captive audience for the ``Americanization'' of
their diet. A program in Southern California aimed to teach
Mexican-American girls to abandon their diet composed of
vitamin-rich sauces made from tomatoes, chiles, nuts and cheese in
favor of white sauce _ made from flour, butter and milk _ and hard
sauce, a sugar/butter combination.
</P>
<P>
   The war behind them, American middle-class women were ready to
cut their hair, step out into jobs and have a good time. Problem
was, the working classes were ready to do the same thing. So
instead of the standard jobs of cleaning house and helping the
missis with the children, jobs in factories and offices got the
nod. Middle-class women became dependent on their own cooking and
housekeeping skills.
</P>
<P>
   These women had big business ready to help them in those daily
chores. Between 1921 and 1929, the home appliance industry tripled
its output. Americans spent $667 million on household appliances, a
500 percent increase over 1909 purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Pickford, Theda Bara and Rudolph Valentino, the era's movie
idols, promoted the idea of being thin. This, compounded by home
economics classes in schools and the availability of womens'
magazines, started America on its ongoing war against fat.
</P>
<P>
   Although kitchens were still built at the rear of houses, it
became common to locate the sink beneath a window so the person
washing dishes (now more likely the homemaker than a paid employee)
could enjoy a pleasant view.
</P>
<P>
   Still obsessed with sanitation, enamel work surfaces began to
replace zinc and wooden tops on the very popular Hoosier cabinets.
Designers began introducing color into heretofore all-white (read
clean) kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen was still considered a workstation, and eating was
almost always done in an adjoining breakfast room or dining room.
</P>
<P>
   America was still obsessed with progress, which meant prepared
foods, foods in cans, particularly. Although flavor may have
suffered, Americans no longer had a ``winter'' diet of meat and
bread and a ``summer'' diet of fruit and vegetables. Mostly,
Americans were in high cotton.
</P>
<P>
   But that was all about to change. October 1929 saw the stock
market crash and a country that was faced with the worst economic
trial of its history.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   1920: Prohibition goes into effect in January. Although drinking
will continue and lead to the establishment of secret speak-easies,
Prohibition leads to an increase in sales of coffee, soft drinks
and ice-cream sodas. Many bars convert to soda fountains or
tearooms to stay in business.
</P>
<P>
   1920: The 19th Amendment, giving women the right to vote, is
ratified.
</P>
<P>
   1920: From now until 1935, sales of lettuce triple _ most of it
the iceberg variety. The variety is a boon to growers and
suppliers, who find they can ship the dense heads nationwide with
little to no damage to the lettuce.
</P>
<P>
   1920: La Choy Food Products gets its start in Detroit. A grocer
teams up with a Korean he has known since both attended the
University of Michigan to sell bean sprouts in jars. In 1922, the
pair begin canning the sprouts in metal cans.

NEANDERTHAL ORIGINS? SOME SITES TO EXPLORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHAEL POLLAK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Neanderthals are not with us anymore _ or are they?
</P>
<P>
   Scientists generally agree that the stocky, heavy-browed people
with the low craniums _ inaccurately thought of as dimwitted cave
men _ disappeared as a distinct group about 30,000 years ago after
roaming across Europe and Western Asia for almost 300,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   DNA tests reported last year suggest that Neanderthals were a
separate species that had no common ancestor with Homo sapiens for
the last 550,000 years. But the recent discovery of a possible
hybrid skeleton in Portugal now suggests that Neanderthals and
modern humans interbred, and that many of us are at least a little
bit Neanderthal.
</P>
<P>
   If one is trying to learn about anthropology on line,
Neanderthals can help shed light on who we are by showing who we
aren't. One starting point is the Neanderthal Museum
(www.neanderthal.de). It lies in the Neander valley near
Dusseldorf, Germany, where the first fossil of the group was
discovered in 1856. The museum opened in 1996, and drew 250,000
visitors its first year.
</P>
<P>
   Its Internet site summarizes and illustrates recent new finds at
the original discovery sites. The museum's foundation is holding a
special ``family get-together'' this spring to highlight the new
discoveries: it exhibits for the first time bone fragments from all
10 sites in Germany where Neanderthals have been found.
</P>
<P>
   The museum also offers a publication service for academics who
want to see their research posted on line. The Web site provides a
history of Neanderthals and, like most other Neanderthal sites,
discusses a broad sweep of anthropology.
</P>
<P>
   A large site, with fascinating illustrations, plenty of side
pages and links, was created by Kharlena Maria Ramanan, a PhD
candidate in physical anthropology at Indiana State University:
(thunder.indstate.edu/ramanank/index.html).
</P>
<P>
   ``Neandertals were the ancestors that nobody wanted,'' she
writes in her introduction, explaining that the stereotype of the
stupid beast-like shuffler on bent knees, with toes splayed out,
was based on a French paleontologist's failure to see that the old
man whose skeleton he was examining had suffered from severe
arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   She includes separate pages on aspects like tools, shelters, Ice
Age conditions, diet, burials, fire, possible speech and theories
about the fate of the species. Anyone thinking that Neanderthals
were stupid should try making a simple Mousterian knife or scraper
blade, which she describes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most common questions I find myself asking about
Neandertals,'' she wrote by e-mail, ``is exactly what happened to
them. Did they become extinct? Did they interbreed with
Cro-Magnons? Are they a part of our ancestral evolutionary line or
a dead end?''
</P>
<P>
   On-line searching for Neanderthals can turn into wild-goose
chases because of a plethora of religious sites, some of them
fairly stealthy, that purport to ``objectively'' deny evolution and
other modern science.
</P>
<P>
   The Talk.Origins Archive, www.talkorigins.org, is a good
antidote. An offshoot of the Talk.Origins Usenet discussion group,
in which creationists and catastrophists argue with nonbelieving
opponents, the Archive collects essays and articles that explore
evolution from a mainstream scientific perspective. To give the
debaters a reference point, the Talk.Origins Archive has many
articulate overviews of important evolutionary subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Neanderthals have nine listings in the Archive's frequently
asked questions on fossil hominids:
(www.talkorigins.org/faqs/fossil-hominids.html). They include the
``Old Man'' of La Chappelle-aux-Saints, whose misinterpretation
popularized the stereotype of the stooping ape-man.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a mention of the skeletons in the Shanidar cave in
Iraq. One of them was covered with pollen, leading to a disputed
theory that offerings of flowers had been placed on the body and
that this was the oldest-known ritual burial.

 &HT;    A cookbook for every mom
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We know there's no one like your mother. But we're sure there's
a cookbook out there just for her. Even if she doesn't cook. The
fact is, cookbooks today also can be photographic essays, personal
journals or historical records as likely to arouse imagination as
appetite _ thus they make lovely gifts. There are everal new
cookbooks among the spring releases that look ideal for Mother's
Day. We give you a quick look at some of those, along with a few
others that we know moms will love. To help you out, we've targeted
the selections to types of mothers. And though yours surely is
unique, we hope you'll see one here that will appeal to her.
</P>
<P>
   The New Mom
</P>
<P>
   For the mother of infants, toddlers and finicky children, First
Meals by Annabel Karmel (DK Publishing, $16.95) is a must. Karmel
is a mother of three, an expert in child nutrition and a Cordon
Bleu chef. Research began for this book when her first child simply
wouldn't eat much. She went to the library to look for cookbooks
that might help but didn't find any.
</P>
<P>
   So she took her creativity to the kitchen and began
experimenting. Recipes begin with ``first foods'' for infants 4 to
6 months old. Karmel explains all the necessary equipment, from
bibs to blenders, and then gives puree recipes. A similar approach
is taken for several stages of development, ending with a chapter
aimed at children 3 to 5 years old. The emphasis is on healthy food
creatively presented _ most recipes were tested by a panel of
children.
</P>
<P>
   This Sleeping Cannelloni is a great example of Karmel's work.
It's aimed at the 3- to 5-year-old, with the goal of getting them
interested in ``international'' tastes. Little mushroom faces and
black olive boots make for whimsy.
</P>

 &HT;    A cookbook for every mom
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Pssst. Mother's Day is peeping around the corner at
you. That means you need a gift for dear Mom by Sunday. This
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all the perfect children are on top of this. They
already have a thoughtful gift wrapped in the most sentimental
paper and bow. They've ordered the flowers, have the Mother's Day
menu planned and the groceries bought.
</P>
<P>
   If you are a sibling to one of these perfect people, you could
call 'em up and beg to put your name on the card.
</P>
<P>
   But we have a better idea _ swing by a bookstore or hop online
and select the perfect cookbook for Mom.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter if your mother is the ``make everything from
scratch'' chef or a ``get it done in 15 minutes'' cook, there's a
new book on the market for her. Even if she doesn't cook at all,
some make great reading.
</P>
<P>
   Like Amanda Hesser's ``The Cook and the Gardener: A Year of
Recipes and Writings From the French Countryside'' (W.W. Norton,
$32.50). Hesser spent a year working as a cook at the Chateau du
Fey in Burgundy, home of the famed cooking school LaVarenne. There,
she befriends a crusty, wise old gardener, and the story of their
relationship unfolds in a month
</P>
<P>
   -by-month account of the life on the estate, complete with 200
seasonal recipes.
</P>
<P>
   Is Mom way too busy to cook, much less garden? Then ``The
15-Minute Chef'' (HP Books, $15.95) is the book for her. After all,
she deserves to eat well, and so does her family, no matter how
busy the brood is. It has 500 ``fast and fabulous recipes''
compiled by longtime food editor Patricia Mack of The Record in
Hackensack, N.J. And we do mean fabulous, from the deviled steak to
the eggplant Neapolitan. Each recipe comes with suggestions of
prepared items that can be served with the entree to make a
complete meal.

   Does the mere sight of chocolate bring a smile to your mother's
face? Then she really shouldn't live without Nick Malgieri's
``Chocolate: From Simple Cookies to Extravagant Showstoppers''
(HarperCollins, $35). The title pretty much says it all; the cover
photo of an elaborate chocolate ribbon atop a ganache-covered cake
will make her swoon. For those with a sweet tooth with a wider
range than chocolate, there's Melanie Barnard's ``Short &AMP; Sweet''
(Houghton Mifflin, $25), with oodles of recipes for quick desserts.
As we gleaned the latest selections, we found a book for almost
every kind of mom: the one who loves to cure what ails you; the mom
who's a gourmet cook; the mom who's pulling her hair out trying to
get her youngsters to eat; and the one who truly loves to indulge.
</P>
<P>
   There's surely one for your mom _ more perfect than anything
that always-perfect brother or sister has cooked up.

   The Gourmet
</P>
<P>
   So you're one of the lucky ones. Someone with a mom who loves to
cook; who lives to cook. She already has several bookshelves full
of cookbooks and every gadget on earth. She knows where to find
kaffir lime leaves or palm sugar paste. She takes cooking classes
and is always among the first at a new gourmet restaurant. She may
not own a restaurant, but by golly, if she did. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, this mom would be comfortable in the company of her
sisters, like Nancy Oakes, chef of top-rated Boulevard in San
Francisco and Ann Cashion, chef of Cashion's Eat Place in
Washington. At the very least, she'll enjoy reading and cooking
from Women of Taste: Recipes and Profiles of Famous Women Chefs by
Beverly Russell (Wiley, $19.95.) The book includes profiles of 32
female chefs working in some of the finest restaurants in the
country, along with several recipes. Some recipes are complicated _
sure to challenge the cook who loves a challenge. Others, like this
Yellow Peppers and Onion Salad, are easy and should be great
accompaniments to summer meals. It's from Sarabeth Levine of
Sarabeth's Kitchen in New York, and some should be kept in the
refrigerator all summer long.
</P>
<P>
   SALAD
</P>
<P>
   Yellow Peppers and Onion Salad

   1/4 cup freshly chopped parsley
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Wash peppers and cut in half. Remove stems and seeds. Add
peppers to boiling water, cooking just long enough to soften the
skins, about 5 minutes.
</P>

   Using a slotted spoon, remove peppers from pot and put into a
colander. Place colander under cold running water to cool peppers.
Put pepper halves on paper towels to dry. Peel skins and cut
peppers into 3/4-inch wide strips. Put peppers in a stainless steel

   The Bon Vivant
</P>
<P>
   Did your mother refuse to ever surrender her butter? Is she no
stranger to duck fat and lard? Is her idea of total indulgence an
intensely flavored, outrageously rich meal? If she can get the Food
Network, then ``Two Fat Ladies'' is probably her favorite show.
Even if it isn't, she'll find the third book by the English diva
hosts Clarissa Dickson Wright and Jennifer Paterson deliciously
decadent.
</P>
<P>
   In The Two Fat Ladies Full Throttle (Clarkson Potter, $27.50),
Mom can find out how to make Cheese Zebras With Parmesan Ice Cream
or Salmon Filets With Leeks and Cream. We liked this Wylde Green
Chicken, which is a dish Wright invented while visiting a friend
and her godchildren, who live on Wylde Green Road in Birmingham,
England. They loved it so much they urged her to write it down.
Wright said the dish is designed to ``deal with the problem of
tasteless chicken.''

</P>
<P>
   1 1/4 cups water

the chicken breasts in a dish, pour the mixture over them, turning
and working into the flesh. Let stand for at least 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In a large skillet, heat the remaining tablespoon oil and stir
in the mustard, paprika, salt and pepper. Tip the chicken breasts
with the marinade into the pan and saute until they are brown,
about 3 minutes per side. Cut them in pieces while they are in the
pan. Add the chili sauce, rum or vinegar and water and cook over
low heat until done, about 10 minutes.

   The Preservationist
</P>
<P>
   There are those mothers who will spare no effort to preserve the
family history. They have the family tree outlined on the home
computer. Family photos, from the century-old faded portrait of the
great-great-grandfather to last week's snapshot of the new
grandbaby, are all neatly organized and labeled in photo albums.
And their recipe boxes are bulging with cards and faded clippings
from old newspapers, complete with notes written in Grandmother's
hand.
</P>
<P>
   Vale Farrar Kelley got the bright idea to organize her mother's
collection and make a cookbook of it, simply titled Recipes My
Mother Gave Me (Time-Life Books, $12.95).
</P>
<P>
   Kelley said the project originally began as a holiday gift for
all those friends and family who were constantly asking for
recipes. Coming from a military background that had her family on
the move a lot, Kelley's recipes have a variety of regional
influences, from Texas to the Philippines. There's space at the end
of each chapter to personalize with your own family recipes.
</P>
<P>
   The recipes are good home cooking, but not just meat and
potatoes. There's Mom's Eggplant and Fried Green Tomatoes and Mom's
Homemade Fish Rub. Daddy is in there, too, with a recipe for Frozen
Margaritas, and numerous recipes from other family members and
friends. We chose Champagne Punch _ perfect for showers, parties
and special Mother's Day buffets.

   The Armchair Traveler
</P>
<P>
   For the mother who loves to travel to far places while never
leaving her favorite reading chair, Colette Rossant has a story to
share. Rossant, who is French, spent her youth in Egypt, and in her
new book, Memories of a Lost Egypt (Clarkson Potter, $20), she
reveals all the rich recollections of her childhood. And luckily,
many of them are food memories _ the joyous wedding feasts, the
mango tree in the family garden and her Grandmaman's bimonthly
poker game, for which Rossant often helped prepare snacks.
</P>
<P>
   Rossant is now a columnist for the Daily News in New York and a
frequent contributor to many food and travel magazines. This book
includes not only great stories, but great recipes that bring alive
Egyptian cuisine, like this one for angel hair pasta with nuts and
raisins. It's an unusual preparation, but oh so delicious. Rossant
suggests serving it with hot chicken.
</P>
<P>
   SIDE DISH
</P>
<P>
   Angel Hair With Nuts and Raisins
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 5 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: about 25 minutes
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces uncooked angel hair pasta
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2 tablespoons butter, divided
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   1 onion, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   3 cups chicken broth
</P>
<P>

<P>
   3 tablespoons raisins
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Break pasta in 3-inch pieces; set aside. In a skillet heat 2
tablespoons butter with the oil. Add onion and saute until
transparent. Add pasta and fry until golden brown. Cover with
chicken broth, bring to a boil, then lower heat and simmer until
all the broth is absorbed, 18 to 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, roast almonds and hazelnuts in oven until golden.
Remove from oven. In a small skillet, heat 1/2 tablespoon butter.
Add raisins and saute until the raisins puff. Mix raisins with nuts
and add to pasta. Serve hot with roast chicken.

   The Nurturer
</P>
<P>
   Does she always make you chicken soup when you are sick? Did she
lecture you to eat your spinach when you were a kid? Does she
always have a ready diagnosis and a remedy, like ``you need to get
more vitamin D?'' Then your mom would welcome Food for Health &AMP;
Healing (Better Homes &AMP; Gardens, $24.95).
</P>
<P>
   It offers basic guidelines on healthful eating and food safety,
then it devotes individual chapters to ailments from asthma to
Parkinson's disease and offers nutritional advice for prevention
and treatment. For instance, it says antioxidants like vitamin E
may help prevent the degeneration of brain cells that causes
Parkinson's. Safflower oil, fortified cereal, wheat germ and
soybeans are all good sources, the book advises.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the final chapter is devoted to healing recipes like a
North African bean stew, loaded with beta carotene, another
antioxidant that helps keep the immune system healthy. These Ginger
Oatcakes caught our eye. The oats and fat-free milk make them
healthy; the crystallized ginger makes them delicious.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Ginger Oatcakes
</P>
<P>
   Makes 12 pancakes
</P>

<P>
   3 slightly beaten egg whites
</P>
<P>
   1 slightly beaten egg
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons cooking oil
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons dark-colored corn syrup or molasses
</P>
<P>
   1 cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons finely chopped crystallized ginger or 1/4 to 1/2
teaspoon ground ginger
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
</P>
<P>
   3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon baking soda
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   Fresh blueberries or sliced banana (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Orange marmalade or maple-flavored syrup (optional)
</P>
<P>
   In a medium saucepan heat milk over low heat just until hot,
stirring occasionally. Stir in oats. Remove from heat; let stand
for 5 minutes. Combine egg whites, egg, oil and corn syrup or
molasses; stir into oat mixture. In a medium bowl combine flour,
ginger, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda and salt. Add oat
mixture all at once to flour mixture; stir just until moistened.
Batter may be covered and stored in the refrigerator for up to 2
days.
</P>
<P>
   For each pancake, pour a scant 1/4 cup batter into a hot,
lightly greased heavy skillet. Cook over medium heat until golden
brown, turning to second sides when pancakes have bubbly surfaces
and edges are slightly dry. If desired, serve pancakes topped with
blueberries or banana and marmalade or syrup.

   The Hostess
</P>
<P>
   This one's for the mother who knows how to make guests feel
special, whether it's a party of five on the porch or 50 in a
reception hall. The smart and savvy entertainer who doesn't have to
rediscover the art of the cocktail party because she never lost it.
</P>
<P>
   She's probably borrowed some ideas from Martha Stewart over the
years. But she'll love the fact that more than 300 recipes for
fabulous finger foods have been gathered together in Martha
Stewart's Hors d'Oeuvres Handbook (Clarkson Potter, $35).
</P>
<P>
   Some of the ideas, like scooped-out grape cups or 1-inch
breadboxes, seem a little too time consuming, unless of course
mother has a staff. Others, like the miniature jerk chicken
sandwiches tied with chive ribbons, are a tad too precious, but
then we've come to expect that from Martha. But many of the
recipes, like eggplant crisps, sesame-crusted chicken salad tea
sandwiches and figs in a blanket, are downright right-on and would
make any party a hit.
</P>
<P>
   These Blue Cheese Popovers are easier than most _ no hot pans or
hot oil are required. They'd be lovely for Mother's Day brunch.

 &HT;    Mothers Day cookbook recipes
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Purist
</P>
<P>
   Maybe your mom shuns the frozen and canned foods aisles,
insisting on serving her family only what's fresh and ripe at the
moment _ plucking the ingredients directly from the soil. Or maybe
she just fantasizes about it.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, she should devour The Cook and the Gardener: A Year
of Recipes and Writings From the French Countryside (W.W. Norton,
$32.50), the eloquent account of how a young American cook _ with
tenacity, respect and bribes of bread and homemade jam _ pried from
a gruff old Frenchman the mysteries of the magnificent chateau
garden he tended.
</P>
<P>
   Amanda Hesser was working for Anne Willan at Ecole de Cuisine La
Varenne, the famed cooking school in Burgundy, when she became
acquainted with Monsieur Milbert, the gruff and intensely private
gardener whose ``tolerance for an intruder is even lower than his
tolerance for the unexpected frost.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hesser, now a food writer for The New York Times, was
determined to win his trust so that she could better understand
``why thyme's intensity fluctuated, why the leeks sweetened with
age, when the raspberries would be at their peak.''
</P>
<P>
   The vivid prose is as irresistible as her simple but
sophisticated recipes, which are arranged by season and prefaced by
essays describing her experiences in the garden and at the stove.
There's nothing contrived here; each is clearly influenced by what
was fresh and ripe at the time. So in that spirit, present Mom with
a chervil plant or some other fresh herb from the local nursery,
and she just may be inspired to take her gift straight to the
kitchen _ perhaps to whip up this lovely lunch.
</P>
<P>
   SALAD
</P>
<P>
   Egg Salad With Tarragon, Chervil and Chives
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 11 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Don't use new eggs here _ they won't peel easily.
</P>
<P>
   4 eggs
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons best-quality olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   2 handfuls tender Bibb lettuce, trimmed and washed
</P>
<P>
   2 handfuls lamb's lettuce, trimmed and washed, or mesclun
</P>
<P>
   Coarse or kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 tablespoon chopped tarragon leaves (about 1-2 branches)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 tablespoon chopped chervil leaves (about 4 sprigs; if not
available, increase the tarragon to 6 branches)
</P>
<P>
   4 blades chive, sliced thin
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Hard-boil the eggs: Bring a large pot filled with water to a
boil. Add the eggs and cook for 11 minutes. Plunge the eggs in cold
water and peel them. Sometimes it helps to run them under cold
water as you peel them. The water runs between the thin skin that
covers the egg and loosens it, making peeling much easier. Use a
thin knife to cut them in half lengthwise.
</P>
<P>
   In a small bowl whisk 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, the
mustard and the cream until well-emulsified and smooth. Dress the
greens: In a large mixing bowl, combine the greens, season with
salt and pour over the remaining tablespoon of olive oil. Toss well
to coat all the greens.
</P>
<P>
   Pile the greens on a large round plate. Set the egg halves on
the greens in the center of the plate. Season them with salt and
drizzle on the mustard dressing.
</P>
<P>
   Generously sprinkle the herbs over them, and then some pepper.
Serve immediately. If the eggs are slightly warm, all the better.

   The Vintage Mom
</P>
<P>
   For the mother who is up early on Saturday morning scouting out
flea markets and yard sales for vintage tablecloths, weathered
rolling pins and original Fiesta dishes, Mary Engelbreit's Queen of
the Kitchen Cookbook (Andrews McMeel, $24.95) is the answer.
Engelbreit is a popular artist whose artwork is licensed for all
sorts of products, from calendars to magazines. People magazine
described her as the ``Norman Rockwell of the nineties.'' Her
sentimental artwork appears throughout this cookbook, along with
colorful, homey photographs.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 100 recipes, many developed by Miriam Rubin,
a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America who also worked in
the famed Four Seasons restaurant in New York. The recipes range
from the nostalgic, like diner-style meatloaf, to the seasonal,
like triple-berry summer pudding.
</P>
<P>
   Here, we offer a recipe for Roasted Asparagus With Lemon and
Pine Nuts _ a simple and elegant spring dish.
</P>
<P>
   VEGETABLE
</P>
<P>
   Roasted Asparagus With Lemon and Pine Nuts
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 5-10 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 15-20 minutes
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 pounds asparagus, tough ends trimmed
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon loosely packed slivered lemon zest
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons pine nuts or slivered almonds, toasted
</P>
<P>
   Lemon wedges, for garnish
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Oil a 13-by-9-inch baking dish.
</P>
<P>
   Put asparagus into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with the
oil, lemon zest and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, turning the asparagus
until evenly coated with the oil. Roast the asparagus, turning
stalks a few times for 15 to 20 minutes, or until tender.
</P>
<P>
   Season the asparagus with pepper and transfer to a serving
platter. Sprinkle the asparagus with the pine nuts, garnish with
the lemon wedges and serve hot or at room temperature.

   The Supermom
</P>
<P>
   You know the kind. They work all day, then dash from the office
to pick up the kids at the soccer game and scurry home for a quick
meal before the PTA meeting at school. They love good food; they
just don't always have time to prepare it. The 15-Minute Chef by
Patricia Mack (HPBooks, $15.95) should be her new kitchen manual.
She'll be able to put a delicious meal on the table faster than
Superman can change in a phone booth.
</P>
<P>
   Mack is the longtime food editor of The Record in Hackensack,
N.J. Her book includes 500 recipes, all requiring just a few
ingredients and short cooking times. Many of the recipes can be
whipped together with ingredients that are usually found in a
reasonably stocked pantry. At the front of the book, there's a page
of lists of things to keep in the refrigerator and on the shelves
and some gadgets (like kitchen shears and a hand-held blender) that
will help save time.
</P>
<P>
   While many of the recipes are easy and fast, they don't
sacrifice taste. This Deviled Steak is a perfect example _ it's a
snap to prepare, but good enough for company.

   The Chocoholic
</P>
<P>
   We know a few folks who don't like chocolate. We've submitted
their names for the X-files. We're pretty sure Nick Malgieri's
Chocolate: From Simple Cookies to Extravagant Showstoppers would
appeal to most moms. And just about everyone in their family, too.
Malgieri is director of the baking department at Peter Kump's
Cooking School in New York, and he offers 380 luscious recipes that
promise to ``send a shiver of delight down the spine of every
chocolate lover.''
</P>
<P>
   The opening chapter covers chocolate basics, from history to
handling. Then it's on to Swiss Chocolate Hazelnut Cake,
Supernatural Brownies, Chocolate Brioche Pudding With Raisins and
Rum and Frozen Chocolate Bourbon Souffle.
</P>
<P>
   We chose one of the simple classics to get you started _ a
chocolate custard pie. There are only a few ingredients, and if you
cheat and get a ready-made pie crust, you could actually make this
for Mother on Sunday.

<P>
   Chocolate Custard Pie
</P>
<P>
   Makes 8 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: about 40 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 35-40 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Chilling time: several hours
</P>
<P>
   For the filling:
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2 cups half-and-half (or 1 1/4 cups each milk and cream)
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   5 ounces bittersweet chocolate, cut in 1/4-inch pieces
</P>
<P>
   4 large eggs
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon dark rum
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
</P>
<P>
   For the crust:
</P>
<P>
   1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut in 10 pieces
</P>
<P>
   1 large egg
</P>
<P>
   Water (as needed)
</P>
<P>
   When ready to bake the pie, set a rack in the lower third of the
oven and preheat to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   For the filling: Combine the half-and-half and sugar in a
saucepan. Whisk once or twice to mix and bring to a boil over
medium heat. Remove from heat and whisk in chocolate until smooth.
Continue to whisk until chocolate is melted.
</P>
<P>
   In a large mixing bowl, whisk the eggs with the rum and spices.
Whisk in the chocolate mixture, only until mixed. You want to avoid
making a lot of foam on the custard.
</P>
<P>
   Strain the custard into another bowl and skim any remaining foam
off the surface.
</P>
<P>
   For the crust: In the food processor _combine flour, sugar, salt
and baking powder and pulse several times to mix.
</P>
<P>
   Add butter. Pulse to mix butter in completely. When the butter
is incorporated correctly, there should be no visible chunks of
butter, but the mixture should remain cool and powdery.
</P>
<P>
   Beat egg with a fork and add to work bowl. Pulse until dough is
well-combined and begins to hold together. If the dough does not
easily form a ball, add 1/2 teaspoon water, repeating if necessary,
until it does.
</P>
<P>
   Remove dough from processor, press into a disc and wrap in
plastic. Chill dough until firm or for up to several days before
using.
</P>
<P>
   To mix dough by hand _combine dry ingredients in a mixing bowl
and stir several times to mix. Rub butter in, mixing it gently with
fingertips, until it becomes a fine crumble. No visible pieces of
butter should remain, but mixture should stay cool and powdery.
Beat egg with a fork and stir into dough mixture. Continue stirring
until dough holds together in a mass. Wrap and chill as above.
</P>
<P>
   Roll out dough and fit into a 9-inch pie pan. Pour filling into
the pie shell and bake for 35 to 45 minutes, or until all but the
very center of the filling is set. Cool the pie on a rack.

   The Sweet Tooth
</P>
<P>
   Even busy moms like to slow down for dessert, though often they
find they just don't have the time to make homemade goodies.
Melanie Barnard has streamlined the preparation of many desserts,
delivering an impressive volume called Short &AMP; Sweet: Sophisticated
Desserts in No Time at All (Houghton Mifflin, $25).
</P>
<P>
   Mom can learn how to make cakes in a single bowl without sifting
flour, creaming butter or separating eggs. The book includes
several recipes for fruits _ both cool and warm. There are
custards, puddings, cookies and tarts.
</P>
<P>
   We tried this Blueberry Corn Cake. A little shifting of the
cornmeal and flour proportions and the use of heavy cream make this
traditional dinner bread a delightful dessert. Barnard suggests
serving with a dollop of lemon curd or lemon yogurt.

 &HT;    Atlanta entrepreneur aims to help foodies' dreams come true
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ So you think your mother's marinara sauce is good
enough to bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Have you told Aunt Jane a million times that if she'd only slap
a label on those jars of pear honey, she'd make a mint?
</P>
<P>
   How about your own secret recipe for barbecue sauce that always
keeps the folks at neighborhood cookouts coming back for more?
</P>
<P>
   Jake Rothschild is ready to help. Twelve years ago, the
36-year-old entrepreneur created an all-natural cocoa mix that he
has successfully marketed, and now he's spun off a whole line of
</P>
<P>
   J D Rothschild &AMP; Co. food products.
</P>
<P>
   He creates many of them from a new kitchen in Atlanta's old
Fourth Ward, a space that he and some partners have worked to
renovate over the last two years. It's at 676 Highland Ave. N.W., a
small block of storefronts that includes the Roman Lily Cafe.
There's a gourmet carryout business called Whisk in the front of
his building, and an ice cream parlor will open in the back in a
few weeks, where the gourmet food products also will be available.
</P>
<P>
   But to get maximum use of the space ad the kitchen, Rothschild
is launching a small-business incubator for folks interested in
creating and marketing a gourmet food product.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had so many people say they wish they could do what I'm
doing,'' he said. ``And I love to coach and teach, and I definitely
have the expertise.''
</P>
<P>
   Rothschild and his partners, Trent Fisher and Kate Yeager, will
walk people through all phases of a project, from developing the
recipe, finding the ingredients, obtaining U.S. Food and Drug
Administration approval, designing the packaging and creating a
business plan. The fee is $50 an hour, with a free initial
consultation. Rothschild estimates that most people will need about
10 hours of instruction, which will include using the FDA-approved
kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Rothschild got his start while working at the Hardback Cafe in
Chapel Hill, N.C., as a college student. He would complain about
the hot chocolate served there _ the mix was heavy on preservatives
and light on taste. So his boss challenged him to come up with
something better. Rothschild made several attempts, struggling to
find just the right ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he settled on a mix that uses whole milk powder, whole
cream powder and a high grade of cocoa. The result is a hot
chocolate so creamy that it's hard to believe it's from a mix. The
cafe sold 115 cups in the first week, and the cocoa mix has been
more or less a part of Rothschild's life, if not livelihood, ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   Rothschild's first job out of school was in marketing for Turner
Broadcasting, where he tossed some cocoa mix into the gift baskets
that TBS sent out that year to celebrities and supporters. A
supervisor told Rothschild that he should ``do what Ted would do''
and take his passion for the product and run with it.
</P>
<P>
   So he began marketing the mix, snaring local and national
accounts such as Happy Herman's and Macy's. Through the years, he's
learned the ups and downs: When Macy's hit financial hard times, he
took a hit, too. He tried his hand at running a coffeehouse, the
popular Mocha in Morningside, but eventually chose to work full
time on marketing the cocoa and expanding into other products, such
as preserves and vinaigrette dressings. He now has 45 national and
local accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Rothschild credits Atlanta coffee roaster John Martinez as a
guiding hand through the years; now he wants to mentor others
through his incubator program.
</P>
<P>
   His first advice: Keep the day job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to ask a lot of questions, not just tell people
how,'' Rothschild said. ``We will push them to look at why they
want to do this and even if they want to do this. I know a lot of
folks in the corporate world who have that fantasy that one day. .
. . They should probably keep their job and wet their whistle
first.''
</P>
<P>
   For more information on the incubator program, or to purchase
Rothschild products, call 404-581-0420.

VENTURING FROM VICTORIAN TO A MODERN MODE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 9) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af)  
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLASGOW, Scotland _ This city has never been known for its
devotion to contemporary architecture. Despite the recent incursion
of Sir Norman Foster's bold exhibition center, which opened last
year and which is known as ``the armadillo,'' the city has mostly
been a place where planners appreciate an old Victorian building
and where Charles Rennie Mackintosh, the great innovator of the
late 19th and early 20th centuries, is still revered.
</P>
<P>
   But Glasgow, which was named the United Kingdom's City of
Architecture and Design for 1999, is looking to the future. Through
the end of the year, it is devoting itself to architecture and
design through a program called Glasgow 1999, a dizzying array of
more than 300 exhibits, building projects, competitions,
conferences, educational programs and special events.
</P>
<P>
   The $62.7 million program, though wide ranging, is placing
particular emphasis on the way architecture and design affect
everyday life. The highlight will be the opening in late June of
the Lighthouse, an architecture, design and urban-planning center
meant to make Glasgow an architectural magnet for the world.
</P>
<P>
   The city has long been proud of its tradition of taking old,
abandoned buildings in the center of town _ like the stately banks
that flourished from tobacco, shipbuilding and ironworks money in
the 18th and 19th centuries _ and finding ways to convert them into
stores, restaurants, apartments and the like.
</P>
<P>
   In the same spirit, the $19.6 million Lighthouse is to be the
new incarnation of the old Glasgow Herald building, Mackintosh's
first major building. Having stood abandoned since The Herald moved
out in the 1980s, the building is being reconstructed by the
Glasgow architects Page &AMP; Park.
</P>
<P>
   When complete, it will be Europe's largest center for design and
architecture, said Sarah Gaventa, a spokeswoman for Glasgow 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The reconstruction incorporates a startling mix of old and new,
including a tower rising up one side of the old building from which
its new name derives. While preserving Mackintosh's original red
sandstone facade, the architects have built an extension that they
describe as ``a battery pack'' in glass and copper.
</P>
<P>
   About half the size of the original building, the extension
creates a new entrance and houses things like escalators and
elevators. A glass and copper platform, soaring above the building,
will provide spectacular views of the city, while the Lighthouse's
cool, white, contemporary interior is designed to be versatile for
myriad purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Among other features, the Lighthouse will have an interactive
center on Mackintosh's life and work, five areas for permanent and
temporary exhibits, a 100-seat conference room, a cafe and a number
of study centers. ``It's about raising aspirations, about making
people better able to understand why design is relevant,'' Ms.
Gaventa said.
</P>
<P>
   In being selected the year's architecture city, Glasgow beat out
its archrival, Edinburgh, because of Glasgow's ``people-based''
approach to design, Ms. Gaventa said. ``There's a lot of civic
pride here _ people love their city _ and the judges felt that
Glasgow wasn't about grand structures and elitism,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The competition, sponsored by the British Arts Council, provides
the winner a small amount of money and a large amount of favorable
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Glasgow is helping to develop a variety of local projects. For
example, it is providing $825,000 to community groups to build
playgrounds in schools and therapy centers at AIDS clinics. It is
also spending $4.1 million in a collaborative effort with artists
and architects to transform five derelict spots around the city
into playgrounds, gardens and other working public spaces.
</P>
<P>
   And this summer, Glasgow plans to open Homes for the Future, a
$16.5 million project in which seven architects and five developers
have joined to create 100 innovative apartments and town houses on
an abandoned site in a once grand section of Charlotte Street.
</P>
<P>
   The project is made up of a number of mini-apartment buildings,
each reflecting the individual taste and vision of the architect.
One slender, five-story tower, designed by the Ushida Findlay
Partnership, is gently curved to evoke Glasgow's shipbuilding
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   There are also a pair of buildings known as
``Introvert/Extrovert Houses''; designed by the firm RMJM Scotland,
the buildings each have one side of glass and light and another
almost without windows. The project's acre-and-a-half site has been
home to many things, including an infirmary and a factory, but has
long been derelict, gaining the sort of stigma that usually drives
developers away.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that Homes for the Future will help lure back
Glaswegians who have abandoned the inner city for the suburbs.
``It's about restarting city living, showing a positive approach to
the city center as a place to live,'' said David McAllister, the
principal architect for the firm ROCK DCM, which planned and is
managing the project.
</P>
<P>
   The homes, McAllister said, are not just ``dinky houses'' but
apartments and town houses of various sizes that have been designed
by cutting-edge firms taking new approaches to heating, lighting
and the use of interior space; as such they are meant to be
prototypes, he said. The first tenants are expected to move in this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   The homes are priced from $74,000 to $223,000, and some are
available through Glasgow's liberal subsidized-housing program or
as rental properties. A second phase, of 200 more homes, is to be
completed by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Glasgow 99 also includes a parade of special exhibits. For the
last few months, the Old Fruitmarket in the center of town has been
the site of a challenging exhibition called ``Vertigo: The Strange
New World of the Contemporary City.''
</P>
<P>
   Organized by the critic Rowan Moore and designed by the
architectural firm of Caruso St. John, ``Vertigo'' is meant to
provoke as much as to teach, using architectural drawings and
models, videotaped interviews and other audiovisual means to
explore the use of space and the myriad purposes of urban projects,
including Richard Rogers' Millennium Dome in Greenwich, England;
Kazuyo Sejima's high-density public housing project in the suburbs
of Gifu, Japan, and the new World Financial Center in Shanghai. The
exhibit closes on May 16.
</P>
<P>
   Among dozens of other exhibits are ``Home,'' which examines the
way people live and how home design has been transformed in the
20th century (it runs on the Glasgow Green from June 14 to Oct.
31), and ``Mies Van Der Rohe: Architecture and Design in Stuttgart,
Barcelona and Brno,'' which runs at the Burrell Collection from May
14 to Aug. 29.
</P>
<P>
   The legacy of Mackintosh looms large, of course, not least
because of the resurrection of his prized Herald building. But one
Glasgow 1999 goal is to show that he wasn't the town's only
architect in earlier times. So recognition is also being given to
Alexander (Greek) Thomson, Glasgow's great mid-Victorian architect,
who preceded but has long been overshadowed by Mackintosh.
</P>
<P>
   One of Thomson's most important buildings, Holmwood House, an
ornate villa he designed for a wealthy Glaswegian family, is open
to the public after a two-year restoration by the National Trust
for Scotland. Now, on the house's handsomely decorated walls,
visitors can see the nymphets and classical semi-nude figures that
nuns had painted over when they ran a Roman Catholic School there
in the 1950s and 60s.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Thomson, whose buildings reflected Greek,
Persian, Hindu and Egyptian influences and whose work has often
been compared with that of Frank Lloyd Wright, is to have his first
major exhibition, ``Alexander Thomson: The Unknown Genius,'' at the
Lighthouse, from June 11 to Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Deyan Sudjic, who is directing the yearlong program, said he
hoped that Glasgow 1999 would leave more than a physical mark on
the city. ``Even more important is the climate of ideas which will
survive,'' he said. ``The year is trying to say: `Look at design
differently. It's not something other, something alien.'''

   CARRIZO SPRINGS, Texas _ A Houston hospital executive agreed to
pay $6.5 million for one of the most opulent ranches in Texas,
acquiring the sprawling South Texas property from a company owned
by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon.
</P>
<P>
   The bidding lasted only seven minutes Tuesday, with Charles
Veldekens of Houston topping Gil Hodges of San Antonio, who bid
$6.05 million for Crawford Farms.
</P>
<P>
   The seller of the 3,029-acre ranch outside Carrizo Springs was
the New York-based C.F. Han Corp., owned by Moon, who is also
leader of the Unification Church.
</P>
<P>
   The Han Corp. bought the trophy ranch in 1992 for $8.1 million
when it was auctioned by the original owner and builder, Don
Crawford. Crawford spent as much as $32 million to develop the
property in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past seven years, the Han Corp. had financed the
property through Crawford, who held a first-position lien. About $4
million remained as a balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always made their payments on time,'' said Crawford, who
was among 200 interested onlookers at the auction staged by
National Auction Group of Gadsden, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford, a wealthy businessman, now spends his days fishing
near his home on South Padre Island.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the Unification Church was not present at the
auction, but his son-in-law, businessman James Park, was. He
declined to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are satisfied with the auction. We wish the new owners
well. We know they will enjoy it to the utmost,'' Han
representative Michael Natbony said.
</P>
<P>
   National Auction Group President William Bone said the property
was used by Moon, his children and grandchildren as a horse-riding
retreat.
</P>
<P>
   Moon's Unification Church is known worldwide for its legions of
members, and for ceremonies to wed hundreds or thousands of couples
at one time.
</P>
<P>
   The auction attracted 18 bidders, six more than the 1992
auction, when Moon's company bought it. The auction attracted
attention because of its football field-sized, Spanish-style main
home; its large horse-show barn/arena with a saloon; numerous guest
homes; bass lakes and other amenities.
</P>
<P>
   The auction was held in the cavernous den of the main home.
Bidding started at $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   The final sales price in the contract will be $6.5 million, with
the auction company getting a 7.5 percent sales fee. The sale is
expected to close by June 3.
</P>
<P>
   Veldekens, 59, is chief executive of Doctors Hospital-Tidwell in
Houston. His wife, Ashley Veldekens, is a physical therapist. They
have three children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want my kids close to me,'' Veldekens said after placing the
winning bid.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford Farms will be a family home, said daughter Victoria
Roubal. ``We will all be moving here,'' she said. ``My father was
interested in bringing the family together, to grow old together.
We'll make it a place we'll be proud of.''

HEY, PILGRIM, CHECK OUT SAINT ARNOLD'S `HOLY WATER'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN MELTON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Growing up Catholic has its share of weird memories: itchy
little scapulars, worn around the neck during Lent, that scraped
tender young skin until it was raw. Or trying to accumulate enough
plenary indulgences for a visa to Purgatory, that strange, murky
bus stop on the road to heaven. Not to mention a lifetime's worth
of guilt, remorse and eternal damnation just for one lousy spring
break's worth of impure thoughts, words and deeds. But, as the pope
said, ``Hey, eternity ain't easy, pal.'' Or words to that effect.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Catholics have St. Arnold, the patron saint
of brewers.
</P>
<P>
   And as far as I know, Catholicism is the only religion that has
intentionally beatified an imbiber. To paraphrase British author
and professional cynic David Lodge, ``Now, that's my kind of
mumbo-jumbo.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings me in a roundabout way to the Saint Arnold Brewing
Co., founded as Houston's first microbrewery in October 1993.
Offering three beers year-round, and five seasonal brews, Saint
Arnold uses no additives or preservatives and doesn't pasteurize,
letting the flavors shine through.
</P>
<P>
   Take its Winter Stout, for example, released Dec. 15. It's a
malty, creamy brew with strong caramel and coffee accents derived
from a specialty Caravienne malt imported from Belgium. A
combination of domestic Cascades and Liberty hops produces a hint
of floral and citrus. The brewery also says that the light
fruitiness is derived from a proprietary yeast strain.
</P>
<P>
   My only caveat (yes, it's Latin; get over it) _ I wanted a bit
more chewiness in the texture instead of a somewhat pervasive
wateriness. On balance, however, Saint Arnold's gets my official
Imprimatur (Seal of Approval).
</P>
<P>
   But how, you inquire, did Arnold achieve sainthood? Glad you
asked.
</P>
<P>
   Born to a prominent Austrian family in 580, St. Arnold was
proclaimed bishop of Metz, France, in 612, and spent his holy life
warning peasants about the dangers of drinking water. Beer was
safer, he opined; ``From man's sweat and God's love, beer came into
the world.'' He died in 640. A year later, the people of Metz
requested that his body be exhumed and reburied in their Church of
the Holy Apostles. During the arduous trip, the tired porters and
followers stopped at a tavern in Champignuelles. There was only one
mug of beer to be shared, but that mug never ran dry, and all the
thirsty pilgrims were satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   Kind of puts a new spin on the term ``holy water,'' eh?
</P>

SCRAMBLING TO FIND CUPID IN A HAYSTACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN: Ohio, Ind., Neb., N.D., S.D.  
 (jt)  
 By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW WESTON, Ohio _ Myron Stammen was still milking his cows when
his guests arrived one Saturday evening, but nobody seemed to mind.
It was an understanding crowd, single farmers like himself, well
aware of the demands and routines of farm life.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if it hadn't been raining buckets all day, it's a good
bet that fewer of the farmers would have been able to break away
from their own fields to make it to Stammen's. Some drove hours to
this stretch of corn and bean country in western Ohio, coming from
across the state, from Indiana, Illinois, even upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   They were all part of Singles in Agriculture, which sprang up to
provide solace and social life to farm people. On this evening, 35
men and women, mostly in their 40s and 50s, piled into the
high-roofed white barn that Stammen had cleared of tractors and
equipment and hung with green and yellow crepe paper streamers.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone had brought covered dishes, and they were laid out on a
table Stammen usually uses for work tools: deviled eggs, country
ham, berry pies. The guests square-danced and did something called
a waterfall, where the men and women line up and dance with
whoever's next in line. The highlight came when everyone sat on hay
bales near the silage wagon and the combine heads to watch videos
of a plowing contest. Stammen was proud to present the plowing
display: the contests are feats of skill, he says, because the
field has to be plowed so straight it looks like ``a pair of
corduroy jeans.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also hopes that at one of these events, he will meet a
woman who will want to share his life on the 330-acre farm he is so
proud of. At 40, Stammen, with his compact build and hands
work-roughened to the consistency of sandpaper, has been looking
for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   A typical brushoff, he said, came from a woman he had a date
with about 10 years ago. ``When I picked her up, she asked me what
kind of farmer I was, and I said I was a dairy farmer,'' he
recalled, still smoldering as he pushed up the sleeves of his plaid
snap-front shirt. ``She took one look and said, `Oooh, that sounds
like work.' Well, if I could have, I would have put the car in
reverse and told her to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Being a single farmer isn't just a temporary inconvenience these
days. Farm life can be a hard sell, and it's getting harder all the
time. Stammen needs someone who appreciates the fact that his days
and a good part of his evenings are absorbed with his 140
Holsteins, a scattering of hogs and his careful rows of grain. He
needs someone who doesn't mind that his mother lives on the farm,
that a trip to town takes you to New Weston, Ohio (population 148),
and that the closest big city is 60 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The demographics of farming are not exactly a Cupid's dream.
There are fewer and fewer farmers: in its 1997 census, the
Agriculture Department found only 1.9 million farms, half as many
as 40 years before. Farmers are also older, and the department says
that more than 90 percent are men. (That figure doesn't include
women who work farms with their husbands, only those who are the
sole or primary farmer.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to meet people out in the middle of the prairie,''
said Fred Scheevel, 45, a bachelor farmer who raises cattle and
grows corn and wheat on land his grandparents began farming on the
border of Minnesota and Iowa around the turn of the century. ``A
lot of the females in this part of the country are ladies who came
from farm backgrounds and know how tough it is. Once they get off
to school, they're gone. They're headed for better-paying jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Scheevel, who lives ``a good two miles from the nearest blacktop
road,'' has tried his luck with those who have stayed close to home
and has had more than his share of fix-ups and blind dates. But the
women don't stick around for long. ``There's a lot of nights where
you're just tired, and, oh, you fall asleep reading the paper,'' he
said. ``A lot of them figure that's not their kind of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Farming is getting more expensive, too. Farms are getting
bigger, as farmers leaving the business sell out to those still in
it. Equipment, chemicals, computers, insurance _ they all cost more
money. And farmers have been buffeted by low prices for things like
wheat and hogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here I am trying to live with income from 20 years ago,'' said
Stammen, who is $300,000 in debt. ``For a lady to accept me in a
relationship with that type of responsibility, it's a real
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The money crunch can put added pressure on single farmers to
marry: they need help on the farm or a second nonfarm income. But
it also makes it harder for them to make the effort to find a mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traveling to meet someone costs money,'' said Bill Rosin, 50,
an organic farmer who lives near Selby, S.D., not far from the
North Dakota border. Rosin said he was ``pretty serious about a
girl a couple of years ago,'' but she would have had to give up her
job to move. ``She kind of wanted a guarantee that we'd prosper out
here,'' he said. ``There aren't any guarantees.''
</P>
<P>
   For all its freedom and fulfillment, farm life can be isolating.
Neal Rau, 39, who raises cattle and grows grain with his parents in
Medina, N.D., said he began a Dale Carnegie course 32 miles away,
in Jamestown, ``just to get back some of my social skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Heinze, 45, who farms near Dazey, N.D., believes his
marriage of 15 years failed largely because his wife didn't share
his enthusiasm for raising cattle and growing sunflowers, barley
and alfalfa. After his divorce five years ago, Heinze thought he
would be remarried within a year. But it hasn't worked out that
way. He has trolled the bars in Fargo, 72 miles away, but ``it's
hard to talk to city girls,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers who have tried dating services say they often come up
empty. And as if to underline the distance between the single
farmer and true romance, a rural Midwestern singles newspaper is
crammed with advertisements for mail-order brides: ``Beautiful
Filipina Ladies Want You!'' and ``Exotic Pacific Island Ladies Seek
Correspondence!''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Singles in Agriculture has become an important
social outlet. The group grew out of a 1984 article in Farm
Journal, ``Finding a Mate Got You Buffaloed?'' The magazine invited
readers looking for mates to send in their own little personal
notices. When 2,700 poured in, the editors encouraged the formation
of a rural singles group.

 NEW WESTON: singles group.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With nearly 1,300 members in more than 40 states _ men and women
who farm or have farm backgrounds _ Singles chapters plan events
like the trip to the Ohio Beef Expo and Trade Show or the South
Dakota Farm Show Fling. Some farmers travel hundreds of miles for
these weekends, looking for mates or simply to socialize. They chat
as they eyeball the latest in milking machines or farrowing pens.
There might be a tour of Oklahoma City's Cowboy Hall of Fame or a
hayride on a Minnesota farm. At night, there is almost always a
dance.
</P>
<P>
   Drinking and smoking are frowned upon, and cohabiting in the
hotel rooms ``is definitely, definitely discouraged,'' said Dee
Pounds, the vice president of Singles in Agriculture, a farmer
turned Culligan man from Falls City, Neb. And there is usually a
church service on Sunday. ``It's a real good organization,'' Pounds
said. ``It's got good morals.''
</P>
<P>
   Every event ends with a kind of group hug, where the members
form two concentric circles, men in one, women in the other. The
circles rotate so that each man ends up hugging each woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're single, sometimes you don't get that many hugs,''
said Jan Hladik, a 55-year-old widow who was at Stammen's
gathering. ``You're alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as important to some farmers is the organization's singles
directory, issued four times a year.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Porter, 36, who works his parents' farm near Grandin, N.D.,
got four or five letters after posting this pitch:
</P>
<P>
   ``Tired of being Mr. Nice Guy, but that's who I am. This
brown-haired, nonsmoking dairy farmer has been looking for love and
friendship in all the wrong places. Green acres is the place I'll
be. Farm living is the life for me. Go ahead, write me.''
</P>
<P>
   He has written back and thinks he might like a woman in Illinois
who hauls asphalt in a semitrailer rig.
</P>
<P>
   Lily Jones, a member of the Ohio chapter, found Bill Rosin
through the directory and even went to see him in South Dakota
twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``With his having to feed his cows and all, he just couldn't
leave, so I went out there,'' said Ms. Jones, who is an egg grader
for the Agriculture Department. ``I thought it was going well, but
he just put on the brakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosin said that Ms. Jones ``kind of put me on the spot and said,
`Commit or I'm gonna move on.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess she kind of fell for me faster than I was ready for,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Stammen's Saturday-night party, Ms. Jones, who is 40 and
divorced, said she was really hoping to settle down with a farmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people in the city don't have the family values I
was raised with,'' said Ms. Jones, who grew up on an egg farm near
Toledo. ``Sure, when I was 18, I thought farm guys were pretty
boring, but now, with what I've been through, boring would be
nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Some singles have had more dating success. Liz Fallis, 55, an
accountant from Shelbyville, Ind., showed up at Stammen's with
Gordon Pavey, 60, whom she has been dating since they met a few
months ago through the Indiana Singles chapter.
</P>
<P>
   Stammen knows that many members attend just for the dancing and
socializing, but he believes the events should have an educational
component, too. The plowing show was carefully planned, with a
speech by Bill Goettenoeller, a champion plower, who used a felt
tip pen to draw a schematic diagram of fields and furrows on an
easel and advised the farmers to ``always plow straight, because
even a badly plowed row looks better straight.''
</P>
<P>
   At one of his barn dances, Stammen had a friend who teaches
psychology at a community college give his guests a personality
test. On Valentine's Day 1998, he invited the editor of Successful
Farming magazine to speak. ``He spoke on the 10 focuses of family
farming, how to add joy to your family farm,'' Stammen said. ``I
was disappointed people weren't as interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Stammen has met a few women through Singles in Agriculture, but
nothing has worked out yet. Recently, he had hopes for a dairy
farmer's daughter from Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought me and her had some very nice positives,'' he said.
But she wouldn't give him her number. ``I didn't think my asking
for her phone number was out of line, being that she was so far
away. I guess I was barking up the wrong tree.''
</P>
<P>
   At his party, Stammen's hopes were piqued by a woman from
Lafayette, Ind., who danced with him and seemed to enjoy the tour
of his house and farm. But when Stammen called to ask her out, the
response was discouraging. ``I was told this point-blank: that I
worked too much. She said, `You have to have some fun in life.'''
</P>
<P>
   Recalling that romantic near miss, Stammen blew out a quiet
breath. ``I've been through this process so many times,'' he said.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The fit and not so fit were straining on weight
machines and panting on treadmills the other night at the Ketchum
Downtown YMCA. Grimacing with effort and dripping with sweat, they
toned bodies that, in some cases, showed signs of a few dietary
indiscretions.
</P>
<P>
   Monitoring the scene was a personal trainer who counted every
pound lifted and offered advice like ``go slower.'' But this
trainer lacked the defined muscles and tight shirt typical of such
instructors.
</P>
<P>
   The trainer, tucked away in another room, was a computer. What
it lacked in physical strength it made up for in its ability to
monitor nearly every piece of fitness gear, recall the workouts of
hundreds of members and calculate the calories burned.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days, you carried a card and filled it out _ when
you remembered to bring it,'' said Mounir Ghaly, a bank marketing
manager who was at a computer kiosk and scrolling through detailed
lists of his workouts. ``This keeps track of everything I do.''
</P>
<P>
   In many gyms, members manage their own fitness routines or pay
for a personal trainer to help them. But now some gyms are using
computers that remind exercisers how many leg curls to do, what
height to place the seat, how many minutes to run on the treadmill.
People can also use the systems to communicate with the gym staff
by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   While such features may help the customer, they are also
intended to benefit the gym, by making the equipment more
accessible to people who otherwise might not take out a membership.
These electronic trainers also let the staff monitor clients'
attendance, perhaps reducing the dropout rate by giving the gym
information that can be used to sell membership renewals or
encourage customers to return.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can print out a member's record and say, `This is the level
where you started, this is where you are now, and this is how many
calories you burned last month,''' said Rosanne Malogolowkin, the
fitness and health director at the Ketchum Downtown YMCA. ``It
helps their motivation a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   But the cost of such technology may be too great for some
fitness centers. In addition, some patrons are reluctant to use
these systems, and others cannot use them because the kind of
exercising they do is not compatible with wires and sensors.
</P>
<P>
   Herb McMillan, an airline pilot, who was loading a bar with
weights at the YMCA, would have to type all of his lifting records
into the electronic trainer by hand because the kind of exercising
he does cannot be tallied by the computer. Instead, he keeps mental
records.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always done it this way,'' McMillan said. ``I'm
old-fashioned. I'm a creature of habit.''
</P>
<P>
   To use the electronic trainer here at this vast YMCA, members
must complete a medical evaluation by staff members and try out the
fitness equipment with one of the gym's counselors.
</P>
<P>
   After getting set up, members log on to the system and call up
their routines. Each person enters a personal identity code at a
kiosk that looks like an automated teller machine and then again at
touch screens on each piece of fitness equipment.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent evening, Eve Bonham, a legal secretary, was ready to
work her pectorals on an inclined bench press machine. After
entering her personal code, Ms. Bonham followed the instructions on
the display screen to raise the seat to the fifth rung and set the
weights at 30 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Then she started lifting, keeping her eyes on the screen as it
counted down to her goal of 8 to 12 repetitions. A graphic told her
how far to push the weights and pull the handles back. She avoided
getting a beep for bad form, which can mean having to do the
repetition over.
</P>
<P>
   In a few instances, the instruction ``go slower'' appeared
because the computer had decided that Ms. Bonham was pumping iron
too quickly to give her muscles an optimum workout. But in the end,
she did well enough to receive a few beeps of praise and a ``good
job'' on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I like that sound,'' Ms. Bonham said as she pressed
``done'' and read the instructions for which machine to visit next.
``It says, `Good job, top of target,' like it's congratulating
me.''
</P>
<P>
   What guides exercisers through their routines here is the
Fitlinxx interactive fitness network, made by the Fitlinxx company
of Stamford, Conn. Its system has been on the market since 1995 and
is used by about 200 gyms in the United States, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The other major manufacturer of electronic trainers is
Technogym, based in Italy. Its equipment, called the Technogym
system, has been sold since 1996 and is used by nearly 66 fitness
clubs in the United States, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 35 percent of all new gym members quit in the first year,
according to the International Health, Racquet and Sportsclub
Association. But Fitlinxx says the dropout rate in Fitlinxx gyms
averages 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Tyner, marketing manager at the Seattle headquarters of
Technogym's American subsidiary, said her company's product enabled
gym staff members to better track clients' progress.
</P>
<P>
   She gave the example of a fitness counselor, who, by reviewing
the records, spots a slacking client and tells him: ``Hey, Joe,
you're not doing your ab crunches. You can't improve if you don't
do the training.''
</P>
<P>
   In a Fitlinxx setup, every fitness machine is wired to a central
computer. Data, like the number of pounds an exerciser lifts, are
sent to the computer and added to a person's file. Nearly 1,300 of
the Ketchum Downtown YMCA's 6,300 members are enrolled in Fitlinxx.
Using the system is free with a regular membership.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In looking through his records, Ghaly, the bank manager, noticed
that he had an e-mail message from a human fitness counselor who
wrote ``you did very well today'' and asked about scheduling an
appointment. The file also showed that Ghaly had lifted 7,228
pounds in the last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I hadn't come in today, I think I would have fallen below
target,'' he said after deciphering a chart on the screen that
showed he had burned 1,000 calories from exercise in the last
month, equal to about 90 minutes of jogging.
</P>
<P>
   Technogym offers mostly similar features with a few differences,
like providing a video demonstration of how to use fitness
equipment and telling treadmill users at the end of their jogging
that they have completed, for example, the equivalent of 10 percent
of the New York City Marathon, with the distance shown on a map of
the route.
</P>
<P>
   The Technogym system has a wireless design linking the exercise
machines to the central computer and gym kiosk. Exercisers must use
the equivalent of a personal floppy disk. They insert computer
keys, about the size of house keys but with microchips embedded,
into the fitness machines' consoles.
</P>
<P>
   The keys are programmed with users' workout routines and record
their performances. Exercisers automatically download the data from
their workout when they insert their keys into the kiosk to sign
out.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from assisting exercisers and helping to alert the gym
staff to people who might be at risk of quitting, electronic
trainers also put staff members under scrutiny. The computer
records allow gym managers to more easily single out employees
whose clients have a high dropout rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier to assess which fitness counselors are doing well
and which aren't,'' said Ms. Malogolowkin, the YMCA's director of
health and fitness. ``That way you can give them extra training.''
</P>
<P>
   One market where electronic trainer manufacturers expect growth
is in hospitals, to help people with heart problems, diabetes and
sports injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 620 patients are enrolled on Fitlinxx at any one time at
the Healthplex Sports Club, a fitness center for patients and the
public that is part of the Crozer-Keystone medical campus in
Springfield, Pa., said Steve Morgan, the sports club's director of
health and fitness.
</P>
<P>
   The system allows physical therapists to be sure that clients
are following instructions, Morgan said, offering closer monitoring
without having to pay for more therapists.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the venue, electronic trainers are not cheap.
Setting up an average gym costs at least $70,000.
</P>
<P>
   But some in the gym industry think that is too much of an
investment for the return.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the amount of money you have to spend versus the benefits,
these systems cost too much,'' said John Platero, director of
personal training in the California clubs of L.A. Fitness, a chain
based in Newport Beach, Calif. ``It's just another gadget to get
people to exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   L.A. Fitness does not have electronic trainers but does have a
computer in at least one of its Arizona health clubs that gives
video demonstrations and exercise recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Niemeyer, a record company manager who goes to the YMCA
gym three times a week, said she was too lazy to use Fitlinxx.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably has to do with the time factor and, shall we say,
fear of the unknown,'' Ms. Niemeyer said while sitting on an
abdomen exercise machine. ``I haven't even given it the benefit of
the doubt. This is where I really try to forget everything.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ina Van Der Laan, a city transportation engineer, uses the
electronic trainer diligently. A little breathless after a
30-minute stationary bicycle ride, Ms. Van Der Laan questioned how
much it really helped her get in shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``This system keeps me honest,'' said Ms. Van Der Laan, who also
works out with a human trainer.
</P>
<P>
   But scrolling through her fitness records, clearly pleased to
add up the burned calories, she said: ``This isn't anything you
have to have. This is fun to look at, but it doesn't drive me.''

SUBURBS' MASTER PLAN IGNORES TEEN-AGERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Attn: Calif., Md., Fla., Colo.) 
(jt) 
 By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As quickly as the word ``alienation'' can be attached to the
idea of youth, the image of isolation can be attached to a picture
of the suburbs. Is there an unexplored relationship between them?
It is a question being raised in the aftermath of the Columbine
High School shootings in Littleton, a Denver suburb.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the renegade sprawl of suburbs themselves is
being intensely scrutinized, the troubling vision of a nation
re-pioneered in vast tracts of disconnected communities has
produced uneasy discussion about the psychological disorientation
they might house.
</P>
<P>
   Invented as a solution to the sociological ills of cities,
suburbs now stand accused of creating their own environmental
diseases: lack of character and the grounding principles of
identity, lack of diversity or the tolerance it engenders, lack of
attachment to shared, civic ideals. Increasingly, the newest,
largest suburbs are being criticized as landscapes scorched by
unthoughtful, repetitious building, where, it has been suggested,
the isolations of larger lots and a car-based culture may lead to
disassociation from the reality of contact with other people.
</P>
<P>
   Designers of the new American suburbs, which were created as
havens, say they have largely ignored or avoided one volatile
segment of the population _ teen-agers. In recent conversations,
three dozen urban planners, architects, environmental psychologists
and sociologists, and experts on adolescent development agreed that
specific community planning and special places for teen-agers are
missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're basically an unseen population until they pierce their
noses,'' said William Morrish, a professor of architecture and the
director of the Design Center for American Urban Landscape at the
University of Minnesota. ``They have access to computers and
weaponry. The sense of alienation that might come from isolation or
neglect will have a much larger impact than it might have before.
And there are no questions coming from the design community about
what we can be doing about this. We don't invite them in.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every other special interest has been addressed by
enlightened suburban designers _ the elderly, the disabled,
families with young children. But, said Andres Duany, a planner who
is a leading proponent of the ``new urbanism,'' a model of suburban
design based on principles of traditional towns, ``It's the
teen-agers I always bring up as a question mark.'' Duany said that
he had only once or twice included teen-agers in the public process
of planning a suburban development.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good point,'' he said, as though it were an unlikely
idea. ``I should talk to the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Though teen-agers tend to resist advice and choose their own
turf as a territorial issue of establishing self-identity, most
experts interviewed say that design could constructively anticipate
and accommodate anxieties of adolescence. They agreed that
teen-agers need a place to be able to go to, to congregate in and
to call their own; it is a critical aspect of relieving the awkward
loneliness of adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   Between home and school _ spheres compromised by the presence of
parents or the pressure of performance _ places for teen-agers in
the suburbs are as uncommon as sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a paradoxical situation,'' said Ray Suarez, host of
``Talk of the Nation'' on National Public Radio and author of ``The
Old Neighborhood,'' a study of suburban migration published this
month by The Free Press. ``Parents move there for their children;
their children are dying to get out.''

 UNDATED: get out.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like much of the Western United States, Denver is experiencing
vertiginous suburban growth. From 1990 to 1996, the metropolitan
area expanded by two-thirds, to its current size of 535 square
miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typical of the Denver metro area are the new suburbs, where
`downtown' is a four-way intersection with three shopping centers
and a condo development,'' said Charles Blosten, community services
director for Littleton's city planning division. Highlands Ranch,
Denver's largest suburban development, has its own zip code,
``nothing but rooftops and miles and miles of nothing,'' Blosten
said of the numbing repetitions of housing. ``It's got to affect
people.''
</P>
<P>
   That place has an impact on adolescent development and
socialization, only now beginning to be studied, is accepted by
most experts on the suburbs. ``A culture of impersonality has
developed in the suburbs,'' said Jonathan Barnett, a professor of
city and regional planning at the University of Pennsylvania and
the author of ``The Fractured Metropolis: Improving the New City,
Restoring the Old City, Reshaping the Region'' (HarperCollins,
1996). ``The standard of houses is high, but the standard of
community isn't.'' He added, ``It's most people's impression of
modern life.''
</P>
<P>
   And the people it stands to impress the most may be the
impressionable people growing up there _ children.
</P>
<P>
   Morrish said he thought that public transportation to
metropolitan downtowns was crucial for high-school students. He
said that the ability to access ``the system'' _ the world adults
create _ was a vital form of empowerment.
</P>
<P>
   ``What to do after school, how to get to the city, to see other
people and how to negotiate this without parents,'' he said, posing
the issues. ``Teen-agers have to have better access to the public
realm and public activity.'' He recalled a conversation with a
group of high school students who met with the Design Center, which
invites teen-agers to group meetings when it is commissioned to
study neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``One girl said, `All I've got is the Pizza Hut,''' Morrish
said. `` `You go there a lot or you go to somebody's house _ we're
tired of both.'''
</P>
<P>
   Between home and school, in a landscape drawn by cars and the
adults who drive them, is there even a particular place that
teen-agers can call their own? Peter Lang, a professor of
architecture at the New Jersey Institute of Technology and an
editor of ``Suburban Discipline,'' (Princeton Architectural Press,
1997), a collection of essays, said: ``In most suburbs, there's not
even a decent park, because everyone has a backyard. But older kids
never play in the back yard. They'll find even the crummiest piece
of park.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the students at Columbine High School went to
Southwest Plaza, a two-level mall that has video arcades, food
courts and stores, supervised by security guards and closed by 9
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like any suburban community, there's not a lot of places to go
and hang out,'' Blosten said of Littleton. ``I tell you this
because that's where my daughter goes _ the mall.''
</P>
<P>
   Lang said he thought that places like malls were not adequate
gathering spaces for teen-agers, calling them, like many public
suburban venues, commercially and environmentally ``controlled
space.'' He added, ``They are not places for free expression or
hanging out.''
</P>
<P>
   Disagreeing that suburbs create greater alienation is Dr.
Laurence Steinberg, a professor of psychology at Temple University
and director of the MacArthur Foundation Research Network on
Adolescent Development and Juvenile Justice. But he said that he
thought recent tragedies like the incident in Littleton do ``wake
people up to the notion that there is parental disengagement in
affluent suburbs.'' He added: ``We did a a study on latchkey kids.
The kids most likely to be left unattended for long periods were
middle class, in sprawling professional suburbs. Isolated for long
periods of time, there's no counterbalancing force to fantasy.''
</P>
<P>
   The desire for larger, cheaper lots that has pushed suburbs to
rural exurbia results in teen-agers who are alone for large parts
of the day, or an alternative that may be worse.
</P>
<P>
   Morrish pointed out that in communities like Modesto, in the San
Joaquin valley in central California, people commute to jobs in the
San Francisco area, where they enroll their children in schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people in California are taking their kids with them,''
he said, ``making the kids commute.''
</P>
<P>
   The planners who have been most vocally and visibly at work on
restructuring the suburban model have been ``new urbanists'' like
Duany. Their solutions to the wheeling nebulae of tract development
are based on tighter concentrations of houses, businesses and
public spaces connected by townlike elements _ porches, sidewalks,
and parks _ that have largely disappeared from the new residential
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   If teen-agers find their place there, in new towns like Columbia
and Kentlands in Maryland or Celebration, the Disney-built town in
Florida, it is not because of any bravery on the planners' part.
They often foster nostalgic views of families with young children.
But, like conventional suburbs, they overlook the inevitability of
teen-agers in their design.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Katz, the author, with Vincent Scully, of ``The New
Urbanism: Toward an Architecture of Community'' (McGraw-Hill,
1993), spoke of the importance to teen-agers of a place that
existed only for them, neither hidden and ignored nor exposed and
supervised _ in effect, a secret place in full view.
</P>
<P>
   On a visit, Katz discovered that for Celebration's teen-agers,
it was a narrow bridge, ``with low railings, that goes from
downtown to the health club. They find each other. They sit on the
railing. Cars cruise across the bridge. It's on the route to daily
life _ not a back alley, but not the town square.'' Katz suggested
that such a structure could become a conscious part of a community
design for teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   For Diane Dorney, a mother with two teen-age children who lives
in Kentlands, Md., a 10-year-old ``new urban'' suburb of some 1,800
people, the hallmarks of town life work well for both parents and
children. Ms. Dorney and her husband, Mark, moved their family from
a typical town-house development.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to raise our kids in a place that provided more than
just a house,'' she said. ``It's a diverse community, of age and
income,'' with older people, young couples, families. Ms. Dorneye
said that she thought the gaze of the town created a sense of
extended family and moral weight that were its most important
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone sneaking down the street to have a cigarette _ they
don't get away with it,'' she said. ``I don't think teen-agers
should be left on their own until they're caught at the small
things.'' She added, ``When they go into the big things, they know
how big they are.'' She said: ``And we have another way of knowing
these kids, other than the bad things. They're your neighbors, too.
You're always seeing them. You give them another chance.''

IS THERE GOOD BBQ OUTSIDE TEXAS? THESE GUYS SEEM TO THINK SO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is no more holy subject in Texas than barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you could say Friday-night football ranks high, but even
those games are preceded by a barbecue. The same goes for the
college game and what little is left of the professional sport.
</P>
<P>
   No, barbecue is the energy source that drives the state. It is
as important as oil and gas. Politics cannot be conducted in Texas
without barbecue. Anything worth doing is worth doing over a
barbecue. And if you barbecue in Texas, you use beef.
</P>
<P>
   That is going to make ``Barbecue America, A Pilgrimage in Search
of America's Best Barbecue'' (Time-Life Books, $24.95) a difficult
sell south of the Red River.
</P>
<P>
   Written by Rick Browne and Jack Bettridge, ``Barbecue'' is an
open-minded book that includes everything from California salmon
barbecues to clams and mussels and oysters on the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   In between, the writers _ who admit they knew little of barbecue
until they were well into their 40s _ herald the pig-pit cultures
of Arkansas and the Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
   They don't even skip the pedestrian grilling practices for
chicken, hot dogs and bologna.
</P>
<P>
   That will be off-putting to a lot of Texans. Here, we might
grill fish, but we don't barbecue clams and mussels. In this state,
barbecue is a recognized religion and must be accompanied by dry
rubs, mesquite wood and abounding reverence.
</P>
<P>
   Everything else is just ``cooking out.''
</P>
<P>
   Texans will take heart in knowing that there are other places on
the planet where barbecue is revered. For three years, the authors
traveled the United States. They found the Midwest mecca of
barbecue in Kansas City; they went to the Mardi Gras of mobile
smokers at the annual ``Memphis in May'' cook-off.
</P>
<P>
   At one of his first cook-offs, Bettridge (who openly admits
being from Connecticut) received his initial communion of sorts. He
writes: ``The taste of pig and smoke and spice and sauce, all
commingling in meat so tender I hardly needed teeth to eat it. I
pressed it to the roof of my mouth with my tongue, savoring the
complexity of the flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   Browne, the co-author and photographer, you should know, is from
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The two writers did get to Texas on their cross-country trek.
After covering the Possum Town Pork Forkers and Aporkalypse Now at
the Memphis cook-off, they came through Fort Worth-Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Here, they met the tastes and reputation of Sonny Bryan's in
Dallas. Also, they caught Jim Griffin of Wichita Falls cooking for
a Knights of Columbus Hall in Arlington, and Dennis Keuter smoking
away for a VFW Post in Grand Prairie.
</P>
<P>
   The writers acknowledge Texas as the premier spot for barbecued
brisket. But they in no way discount the curls of smoke that arise
from the rest of the land.
</P>
<P>
   In describing the scene to be found somewhere in America every
weekend, they write: ``So much smoke wafts across the horizon that
it looks like some kind of industrial inferno. On closer
inspection, it turns out to be the fumes put off when 300 teams of
barbecue fanatics take over three huge parking lots and cook up
something delectable!''
</P>
<P>
   Here is a recipe from ``Barbecue America.'' It is a different
but doable concoction for smoked chicken. A couple of changes have
been made to adapt it to home use.
</P>

<P>
   BEER BUTT BIRD
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4-6
</P>
<P>
   One 4- to 5-pound chicken
</P>
<P>
   Dry rub:
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon raw sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon garlic powder
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon onion powder
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon paprika
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon dry yellow mustard
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon finely ground sea salt
</P>
<P>
   Basting spray:
</P>
<P>
   1 cup apple cider
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
</P>
<P>
   Steaming liquid:
</P>
<P>
   12 ounces of your favorite beer (canned fruit juice can be
substituted)
</P>
<P>
   Wash, dry and season chicken generously inside and out with rub.
Work mixture well into skin and under skin wherever possible. Set
aside, covered, in refrigerator for approximately 2 hours. Drink
half the can of beer if you like. Insert the can, and the remaining
beer, in the chicken cavity so that the legs and the can itself
hold the chicken upright. Place on smoker grill. This positioning
does two things: First, it helps drain off fat as the chicken
cooks; second, the beer steams the inside of the chicken, making it
very moist.
</P>
<P>
   Smoke 2 to 2 1/2 hours, spraying with basting spray several
times, until chicken is done and internal temperature is 180
degress for whole chicken. Carefully remove the bird from the grill
and ease the can out of the cavity. Place on serving tray and
carve.

BATTLE NOT OVER FOR BROTHER OF EXECUTED MAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIE CHAO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALF MOON BAY, Calif. _ With his favorite West African music
playing on the stereo, waves crashing in the distance and an
endless expanse of blue sky stretched out before him, William
Babbitt smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't cried since I left my brother's lifeless shell,'' he
said Tuesday, 12 hours after watching his brother, convicted
murderer Manuel Pina Babbitt, put to death by lethal injection in
the old gas chamber at the San Quentin Prison.
</P>
<P>
   After waging a long, tiring and ultimately futile campaign to
save his brother's life, William Babbitt, 56, said he was happy to
know that his brother was at peace. But he said his battles were
not over.
</P>
<P>
   He will continue to speak out against the death penalty, which
he called ``a form of ethnic cleansing,'' and to help people who
find themselves in the same dilemma he was in 18 years ago: turning
a loved one in for a violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1980, after hearing about the killing of an elderly
Sacramento woman, Babbitt suspected his younger brother of
committing the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Leah Schendel, 78, was found badly beaten in her apartment, her
dentures broken and her pillow soaked with blood. He knew Manuel, a
Vietnam veteran, was psychologically damaged by the trauma of
combat, but he had never imagined him capable of murder. Then, he
found a lighter with the initials ``LS'' in Manuel's coat pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt went to the Sacramento Police Department, saying he
wanted to get counseling for his brother and offered to apprehend
him. He said he had been given assurances his brother would get the
necessary help.
</P>
<P>
   According to a transcript of a taped arrest interview with
Manuel Babbitt, Detective Terry Brown says, ``You know you're not
gonna go to the gas chamber or anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sacramento Police Department says it never made any promises
to either Babbitt.
</P>
<P>
   William Babbitt said he deserved some recognition for what he
had done and is furious at Gov. Gray Davis for denying the clemency
request.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the governor slapped me in the face after I did the
right thing,'' said Babbitt, his face slightly hollow after four
days of fasting. He said he was fasting to atone for not taking his
brother off the streets earlier and for the pain inflicted on both
families.
</P>
<P>
   He wants the state to enact a law that would prevent a person
from getting the death penalty if a family member has turned him
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they did to Manny sends the wrong message,'' he said.
``This can happen to any family. There's going to be grandmas or
aunties out there _ maybe they know their loved one did that
shooting at the mom-and-pop store down the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt, his wife, Linda, a nephew and a grandson spent Tuesday
relaxing in Half Moon Bay. The Babbitts, who live in Sacramento,
have raised five children in close to 30 years of marriage _ three
of Linda's from a previous marriage and a niece and nephew of
William Babbitt.
</P>
<P>
   William Babbitt was the only relative his brother would allow as
a witness to the execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of his last words to me was, `Billy, don't beg,''' Babbitt
said.
</P>
<P>
   Early Tuesday, the day after he turned 50, Manuel Babbitt was
strapped down in ``the gray wolf,'' his term for the death chamber.
The gray wolf, Babbitt explained, is a predator often used as a
scapegoat.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel looked at his brother, smiled, then closed his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   William Babbitt smiled back and remained smiling for most of the
eight minutes it took for the lethal poisons to stop Manuel's
breathing and heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was smiling because I knew Manny's pain and suffering was
over,'' Babbitt said.
</P>

   He also looked over to the Schendel family, seated in a
semi-circle just a few feet from the windows of the death chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pleaded to meet the gaze of those who readily accepted the
demise of my brother,'' he said. ``I wanted their eyes to meet my
eyes because I wanted them to know everything's going to be all
right.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Schendel family did not look at him. He said he
harbored no malice toward them.

<P>
   With Americans taking on more and more debt, high-tech
collection tactics are making it easier to find debtors and
encourage them to pay up. Or else.
</P>
<P>
   Debt-collection software with names like the Sting, Optimizer
and Determinator help collection agencies find elusive debtors,
phone them and make a plan for them to pay off what they owe.
Programs using artificial intelligence can gauge the likelihood
that a debtor will pay up, and they can match debtors with
collectors who fit their style.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're talking about the customary ways of thinking about
how people buy and sell things with credit, the old paradigms are
being outstripped by new technology,'' said Ronald Griffin, a law
professor who teaches a debtor-creditor relations course at
Washburn University in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   As of February, American consumers had amassed $1.3 trillion in
outstanding installment debt, up 7 percent from the previous year,
according to the Federal Reserve. In 1997, the most recent year for
which data are available, debt totaling $247.4 billion was sent to
collection agencies, which recovered $32.2 billion that year,
according to the American Collectors Association, a 3,600-member
trade group based in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Modern debt collectors look back with some nostalgia at the days
when they worked from 4-by-6-inch index cards in shoeboxes. Now
computers dig through proprietary databases, find and dial numbers,
determine when debtors are most likely to be home, improve the
efficiency of telephone collection centers, calculate how risky a
holder of a credit card or mortgage is and generate letters and
scripts for phone calls. With some of these applications running,
you can't hide.
</P>
<P>
   Debt collection agencies rely on the sale of bad debt. After a
bill is overdue for a certain length of time, credit card companies
and other creditors often sell the debt for pennies on the dollar
to agencies, which are allowed to keep anything they can extract
from the debtor.
</P>
<P>
   It's worth it for the creditor, which can at least collect
something on debt that would have been a total loss otherwise, and
it's worth it for the collection agency, which is more skilled and
experienced than Visa and Chase Manhattan in the art of mining
deadbeat accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the collector's first step is to find where to find
the debtors _ or customers, as they are called at one agency,
Exterra Private Recovery in Walnut Creek, Calif. (``We don't allow
the D word here,'' said Barbara Price, the company's co-founder and
executive vice president.) Banks and other credit providers want to
keep customers by having collectors work out a payment plan _
courteously.
</P>
<P>
   Computer terminals from far-flung locations can use the Internet
to tap into the system, so some collection agents can work from
home. That is a boon to at-home parents, handicapped workers and
agencies hungry for skilled workers.
</P>
<P>
   One star account manager, Priscilla Corley, has been with
Exterra since it opened in 1997. Using databases and software made
by Rothenberg Systems International, Ms. Corley finds people with
bad debt by tracing them through other creditors listed in their
credit reports, who might know the customers' whereabouts. The
agency also uses a variety of other directories and databases.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Wednesday, Ms. Corley was on the phone while
studying her computer screen, narrowing in on a lead. She got the
caretaker of the debtor's mother to give her the phone number of a
close relative of the debtor.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Corley, who recently won a lease for a 1999 Cadillac from
Exterra for her productivity, handed the number over to her
partner, Marla McCown, to follow up. Ms. McCown's wall is covered
with 10 overnight mail envelopes, marked with the dollar amounts of
the payments that arrived in them.
</P>
<P>
   Then a manager announced the amounts collected during the
morning. Everyone stood and waved plastic noisemakers that are
shaped like hands, creating a clackety applause. Managers want to
keep the job interesting, in a field where annual turnover rates of
40 percent to 80 percent are common. It can be frustrating for
callers to find debtors and put up with verbal abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Once debtors have been found, collectors try to get in touch
with them by phone or through the mail or through neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Dialing software places the calls, and, if a person answers, the
machine passes the person along to an available collector. That
saves the collector the trouble of dialing or dealing with busy
signals or answering machines. The dialing software that automates
this task includes programs like the Optimizer, by Centerforce
Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   The dialers' software is called predictive because it has a
strategy. ``The odds are, if you're not there Monday at 9 a.m.,
then you won't be on Tuesday or Wednesday at 9 so the machine will
try again at noon, in the afternoon and the next day in the
evening,'' said Jon Mazzoli, senior vice president at Outsourcing
Solutions, a collection agency in Chesterfield, Mo., that tries to
track down 10 million debtors a year.
</P>
<P>
   Outsourcing Solutions' technology can predict when a collector
will finish a call, dialing the next call so the collector can go
straight to the new debtor without losing any time. (This is the
same technological advance that brings you those hang-up calls at
supper time from telephone solicitors.)
</P>
<P>
   In half the debt-collection and sales offices with predictive
dialers, collectors have been able to triple the time they spend on
the phone talking to people, to 45 minutes an hour from 15 minutes,
said Tom Buiel, the vice president for domestic sales at Melita
International, a telecommunications software company in Norcross,
Ga.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Many collectors use a computer scoring system to figure out the
likelihood that a bad debt will be paid. Some programs way use
artificial intelligence so they ``learn'' from and incorporate
earlier collection results.
</P>
<P>
   ``We typically look at several hundred characteristics, 300 or
400 or 500 characteristics, for an individual,'' said Bernhard
Nann, president and co-founder of Narex, in Lakewood, Colo., a
company that was set up in 1995 to develop debt collection programs
that use artificial intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Based on information about the debtor _ like the size of the
person's previous debts and how quickly they were repaid _ the
company determines which kinds of letters and calls the person
should receive. Or it decides that the debt is ``self-curing,''
something that will be paid without a reminder. The results are
plugged back into the system to help the software make future
calculations.
</P>
<P>
   The computer screens collectors see can also help direct their
work. In Sweden, one program puts a face with either a smile or a
frown on the account on the screen, which tells collectors what
tone of voice to use with the debtor, said Susan Magrino, vice
president of Rothenberg Systems International. And Magellan
software provides scripts that tell collectors which questions to
ask after gathering each bit of new information.
</P>
<P>
   ``The machine does the thinking, so the agent doesn't have to,''
said Diane Katzaman, a senior product marketing manager at Melita,
which created Magellan.
</P>
<P>
   Software can also rate consumers' creditworthiness. The Fair,
Isaac Co., a credit scoring company in San Rafael, Calif., that was
founded in 1956, was one of the first to take many factors into
account to come up with a credit rating. While many consumers
complain about the rigidity of such scores, some in the debt
collection industry say the scores are fair because they disregard
race, sex, religion and birthplace, focusing more on credit
histories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Machines are absolutely dead fair,'' said Ted Crooks,
executive director of the scientific staff at HNC Software, which
creates debt scoring programs. ``They don't know what color you are
or anything about you _ they just know the data and the account
history, and that people with data like yours had this kind of
outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology like this will benefit all of society, said Vijay S.
Mookerjee, an associate professor of information systems at the
University of Washington Business School. For small-scale lending,
``it is just not cost-effective for the bank or lending agency to
use human capabilities to do that when you can really boil it down
and optimize the profile and do it automatically,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So do all of these innovations result in the collection of more
money? The results are mixed. Recovery rates at consumer collection
companies reached a four-year high in 1997, according to Credit
Collections News and the Credit Collections Directory, with an
average recovery rate of 24.5 percent among the 300 agencies
surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   But the American Collectors Association traced a decline in the
percentage of debt that was collected by about 300 agencies, to 13
percent in 1997 from 22 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Collecting debt may be easier now because the careful screening
and scoring of people applying for credit means that bill payers
are more likely to be reliable. The strong economy also makes it
easier to collect debts. And because creditors almost always regard
fresher debts as easier to collect, some creditors are placing
their overdue accounts with collection agencies sooner than they
used to.
</P>
<P>
   But some creditors are waiting longer before turning to
collection agencies. Now that more high-tech collection tools are
widely available, a creditor will often try to use them first,
before selling debts to an agency. Skimming the cream off their
debts, many banks and credit card companies are dealing with the
fresher, more easily collectible debts themselves, leaving the
harder, older ones for the agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're being asked to do more and more for their clients at
less and less of a rate,'' said Toni Nuernberg, the chief operating
officer of the American Collectors Association.
</P>
<P>
   They are asked to be more efficient and, yes, nicer than they
used to be. As Ms. McCown sifted through the form letters she can
send from Exterra _ the Demand letter, the Broken Promise letter,
the Broken Promise on Settlement letter _ she explained her
philosophy of working with her ``customers'': ``Just be nice, and
give them the opposite from what they're giving you.''

FULL-SIZE TUNDRA PASSES COWPOKES' `HAT TEST'   
 (ART ADV: PHOTO HAS BEEN SENT TO NYTNS PHOTO CLIENTS)

 TEST-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICKENBURG, Ariz. - Leaning on a tailgate, the three cowboys
were talking pickup trucks. Full-size pickup trucks. Uniquely
American. Big as the land.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, they'd be discussing the merits of Chevys and Fords,
maybe a Dodge, with such names as Silverado, Ram or Laramie.
</P>
<P>
   But there they were checking out a newcomer, something they'd
never seen before, something that seemed sort of heretical. It was
a full-size pickup truck, all right, but it was built by Japanese
automaker Toyota.
</P>
<P>
   The cowboys seemed unsure how to judge the interloper, until one
of them, C.W. Williams, piped up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's give it the hat test,'' he said. His partners nodded in
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The hat test?
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, there's nothing worse than getting into a truck and
finding out your hat don't fit,'' said Williams, 53, a Wyoming
cowboy in a broad, well-worn Stetson rolled up on the sides and
curled down fore and aft.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, they sat behind the wheel of the new pickup to
sample the headroom, or this case, hatroom. And each proclaimed the
Toyota fit for a cowboy, complete with hat.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Williams and his buddies, Willum Mallernee and Jeff
Deming, agreed that the Tundra cab is small compared with the
domestic competition. And they found it to be a bit short in the
stirrups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legroom could be better,'' said the lanky Deming.
</P>
<P>
   The new Toyota Tundra represents the first-ever offshore assault
on the American institution of big pickup trucks. It has all the
needed credentials: a large profile, rugged looks and a brawny V-8
engine.
</P>
<P>
   But truck guys are a stubborn lot, loyal to their brand, and
possibly slow to accept a full frontal attack on their favorite
work-and-play vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had Fords all my life, and convincing me to switch is
gonna be tough,'' Williams warned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a Chevy guy,'' added Mallernee, 25, also of
Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   The cowboys were gathered just outside the main corral at Rancho
de los Caballeros, a resort and dude ranch where they work winters
while waiting to return to their homes up north to ride herd in the
warmer months.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona is the heart of pickup-truck country, and this is where
Toyota chose to make the Western U.S. media introduction of its new
truck on Thursday. Parked beside a rustic rail fence and a towering
stand of paddle cactus, and surrounded by the fragrance of the
milling horses, the Tundra's message was loud and clear: There's a
new gun in town, and it feels right at home in a classic scene from
the Old West.
</P>
<P>
   But for many drivers of full-size pickups, it's the traditional
image of the American pickup, romanticized in countless movies and
commercials in dusty pastel, that has so much appeal. It's the
image that lures business executives and high school seniors _
including a growing number of women _ into the cabs of pickups.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, newcomers often buy their first pickups after a
short time in the state. And in one sobering statistic, Chevrolet
pickup trucks usually come in first as the most-often-stolen
vehicles in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Higgins, a Toyota market planner for pickup trucks, said
the Tundra launch is the biggest thing that Toyota has done since
it unveiled its Lexus division in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The full-size pickup represents a bold move on the part of
Toyota that is not without risks, and a huge investment, Higgins
said. But it vies for a fat piece of the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toyota now has a truck that will compete head to head in the
largest, most competitive, most lucrative segment in the auto
industry,'' Higgins said.
</P>
<P>
   But that segment is a hard nut to crack, Higgins acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a segment-loyal and brand-loyal consumer who has
purchased and replaced domestic full-size pickups over and over, in
some cases, for generations,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   How large is the pickup-truck market? Huge. In the 1998 calendar
year, the Ford F-series pickup truck was by far the top-selling
vehicle in the United States, racking up 836,629 units, the most
for any vehicle in two decades. Chevrolet Silverado and its
corporate twin, GMC Sierra, totaled 698,809 trucks sold.
</P>
<P>
   Those are big numbers. Compare them with the top-selling
passenger car for 1998: Toyota Camry hit 429,575 for first place.
</P>
<P>
   In the first year, Toyota plans to build just 100,000 Tundras,
which it expects to sell easily.
</P>
<P>
   One thing the Tundra has going for it is that, although it was
designed in Japan and sold by a Japanese company, it's made at
Toyota's new Indiana plant, built specifically for the Tundra.
</P>
<P>
   But is it possible to lure pickup drivers from their Fords,
Chevys and Dodges?
</P>
<P>
   There are several distinct types of pickup-truck drivers,
according to automotive analyst Jim Hall of the Detroit-based Auto
Pacific Group, and the Tundra will appeal to some but not others.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (Toyota) are going after the recreational user, the guy
who has some change to drop on a new truck,'' said Hall, noting
that most of the Tundras will be four-wheel-drive and all of them
will be of the less-hearty but more-drivable half-ton variety.
</P>
<P>
   However, many pickup drivers like the large size and heft of the
domestic trucks, he said, and they are unlikely to be won over by
the marginally smaller, lighter Tundra.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not into bulk, the Tundra has everything: good
looks, a great engine,'' Hall said. ``It's a half click down. It's
smaller than the other trucks, there's no doubt about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy that's buying bulk is going to continue buying bulk.''
</P>
<P>
   C.W. Williams said he's sticking with Ford. After all, his truck
is a work vehicle, and he's found that Ford serves him well.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix electrical engineer Don Patton, who drives an aging
Chevy pickup, uses his truck for basic transportation, as well as
camping and household chores. His son, Chris, also drives a Chevy
pickup. And his wife, Rita, can usually be found in the family's
Chevy Suburban, which is built off the full-size pickup.
</P>
<P>
   Don Patton doubted he would ever switch brands, mainly for
practical reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm used to Chevys, and I know how Chevy does things,'' he
said. ``When something breaks, I know how to fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry Dodd, owner of European Detail, an auto-detailing service,
is one of those drivers who uses a pickup truck for fun and
styling, not for hard work. He recently defected from Chevrolet to
Ford and said he might be willing to switch over to Toyota if it
has the right stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm interested in seeing what this Toyota looks like,'' Dodd
said. ``If I like the body of the truck, maybe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always liked Japanese engineering, but I never liked
their look. I'd be interested if it was eye-appealing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall said it's not the new Tundra, Toyota's first foray into
uncharted waters, that should worry the Detroit manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern the Big Three need to have is not this vehicle but
the next one,'' Hall said. ``The question is: When they build the
next generation, will they go up in size?
</P>
<P>
   ``If they do, the Big Three might be in for an awakening.'' &QL;

NEW SENSE OF PRIDE: GOLIAD WOMAN FINDS MUCH TO CELEBRATE IN MEXICAN
HERITAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOLIAD, Texas _ Estella Zermeno's home is a small, neatly kept,
bicultural family shrine. There is a hand-colored photo of her
seven brothers, each in his U.S. military uniform. There are vivid
photos of nieces and nephews who are firefighters and police
officers _ all public servants.
</P>
<P>
   And there are the older, faded photos of Mexican washerwomen and
dark-skinned men wearing stiff white collars. They, too, are
family.
</P>
<P>
   The Zermenos are proud Americans, they said, but they also take
a special pride in their Mexican ancestry. Estella Zermeno can
follow her lineage back two and a half centuries to the beginning
of Goliad.
</P>
<P>
   The South Texas community will observe its 250th anniversary
this year. It was also designated as the focal point for this
year's statewide Cinco de Mayo celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Zermeno's heritage was not easy to record, she said. History and
prejudice have obscured the area's Hispanic legacy. At times,
Spanish was the mother tongue; at times it was strictly forbidden.
Records were often ignored, events forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``The schools didn't teach as much of our history as they
should,'' Zermeno said. ``A lot of us were educated in Texas, and
all we got was the Alamo.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the late 1920s, Mexican-American children in Goliad went
to a segregated school, and then only to the seventh grade. There
was no high school for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looked down on,'' Zermeno said. ``We felt ashamed to
be Mexican. We were people who worked hard, and once we had land
and big ranches.''
</P>
<P>
   Goliad was established in October 1749 when Mission Espiritu
Santo was built along with Presidio La Bahia. Spanish soldiers were
stationed at the presidio to protect the mission and to protect
Spain's interests in the region against the French and British.
Later, they would fight the Texians.
</P>
<P>
   Names that remain prominent in Goliad, as the town was later
named, include Becerra and Cabrera. Estella Zermeno is kin to both.
</P>
<P>
   ``Becerra was Portuguese. He was a soldier at the presidio,''
she said. ``Cabrera was a Canary Islander who moved here from San
Antonio. She came in 1749.''
</P>
<P>
   On a dining room table, the Zermenos have a half-dozen
three-ring binders filled with documents tracing their lineage.
Photocopies of ancient, Spanish-language reports show dates and
places of marriages and births and military discharges.
</P>
<P>
   One diary, kept by Don Manuel Becerra, talks of a trip during
which he guided Don Esteban Austin and 10 Anglo-Americans to the
mouth of the Colorado River ``to select the most suitable site for
a new town which they were authorized to establish.''
</P>
<P>
   The trip began Sept. 15, 1821.
</P>
<P>
   In 1835, after the battle of Gonzales, Texas forces captured the
presidio, or fort, in Goliad. They overpowered the 24-man Mexican
garrison and rallied to sign the ``Goliad Declaration of
Independence,'' the first Texas declaration of independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't know about the atrocities the Anglo troops
committed against the Mexican people of Goliad,'' Zermeno said.
``They beat the men, raped the women and ran a lot of people off
their land. It was hard being a Mexican here.''
</P>
<P>
   The next year, Gen. Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna ordered that
Col. James Fannin and his nearly 500 troops, who had been captured
at Coleto, be executed. The Goliad Massacre became a battle cry of
the republic and further deepened the division between Hispanic and
Anglo settlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our own families were divided,'' said Emilio Vargas, a justice
of the peace and lifelong resident of Goliad. ``It was like the
Civil War; some Mexican families fought for the Texas independence,
some fought for Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a strong sentiment toward Mexico in Goliad. One of its
native sons soon became a Mexican national hero. While the Civil
War raged in the United States, Mexico found itself at odds with
England, Spain and France over increasing debts.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican President Benito Juarez suspended payments of those
debts, and foreign war ships appeared at Veracruz. The English and
Spanish eventually withdrew, but the French were determined to
establish control over Mexico and sent an army inland toward Mexico
City.
</P>
<P>
   On May 5, 1862, Mexican forces led by Ignacio Seguin Zaragoza
defeated the French army. Zaragoza was born in La Bahia. Although
the French won the war, Zaragoza's victory instilled a pride in the
Mexican people that is still celebrated in Cinco de Mayo
observances in Mexico and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A Zaragoza Society in Goliad was established to perpetuate the
Zaragoza name and keep his history alive. Vargas is president of
the society; the Zermenos are members. It is open to all races,
Vargas said, an indication that the cultural differences in Goliad
have been bridged.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was growing up in the 1940s, we were ashamed of what we
were,'' Vargas said. ``We called ourselves Mexicans, Latin
Americans, Mexican-Americans, Chicanos, Latinos, Hispanics. What
are we?
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we are very proud of our ethnic group. We are Americans
first, but we preserve our heritage and customs. We are very much
Mexican, and we can celebrate that.''

TALK ABOUT `STAR WARS' ON A GALAXY OF SITES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHEL MARRIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With about two weeks to go before the release of the new film
``Star Wars: Episode 1 _ The Phantom Menace,'' there are so many
``Star Wars'' sites on the Web that the creator of one site, Jedi
Temple (www.spiderspace.net/jeditemple), felt compelled to list his
favorite 100. And that barely scratched the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly a shred of information or rumor about the $115 million
``Star Wars'' film has escaped legions of wired ``Star Wars''
enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The information is pouring in like crazy from all over the
world,'' said Steve Head, one of a dozen co-editors of The
Force.net (www.theforce.net), a popular fan-created Web site that
promises Web surfers ``your daily dose of `Star Wars.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to have to fish for information,'' said Head, a
33-year-old real-estate marketing representative. ``Now the fish
are flying out of the water.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Web fans promptly package what they know (or think they
know) and post it on sites that include clever design, often using
stunning homemade artwork and computer graphics. There are even
homemade films that include take-offs on ``Star Wars'' characters,
like ``Kung Fu Kenobi's Big Adventure'' (at The Force.net), one of
several parodies made by Evan Mather, a 29-year-old landscape
architect in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just taken on a life of its own,'' Lou Tambone said of
his site at www.starwarz.com. While he said that he is not a
``fanboy,'' mildly pejorative slang for an aggressively obsessive
``Star Wars'' fan, he did mention that the John Williams ``Star
Wars'' theme was played at his wedding reception two years ago. And
on the wedding cake were figurines of Princess Leia and Han Solo.
</P>
<P>
   Tambone, who is 29 and lives in Boston, said the Internet's
relatively low cost, capacity for graphics and digital effects, and
global reach made it a natural medium for the generation that grew
up on ``Star Wars.'' Todd Boyd, a professor at the University of
Southern California School of Cinema and Television, agreed. ``The
core audience of the Internet is the core audience of `Star
Wars,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The strong affinity among ``Star Wars'' fans for the Web has not
been lost on the film's producers, who have answered the flood of
fan sites with a deluge of hype of their own. ``What we found out
was that a great way to communicate with our fans was through our
Web site,'' said Jim Ward, director of marketing for Lucas'
company, Lucasfilm Ltd. ``Rather than simply being a marketing
device, we discovered that it is really a medium for entertainment
and beyond.''
</P>
<P>
   The site (www.starwars.com) offers its millions of Web visitors
something new: truly insider information, production photographs
and the occasional scoop. It was on the site that Lucasfilm first
released the name of the film, ``The Phantom Menace.'' It also used
the site to announce the company's decision _ since rescinded _ to
offer no advance ticket sales for ``The Phantom Menace'' for fear
of ticket scalping.
</P>
<P>
   When the film's first two-minute trailers went on the Internet
last November, Web servers offering the teaser were swamped. When
the second trailer went on line in March, more than a million
people downloaded it in a single day.
</P>
<P>
   But long before Lucasfilm's publicity machine was thrown into
hyperdrive, sites like www.jedinet.com, Starwarz and the Holocron
(www.holocron.simplenet.com) were lush oases for those thirsting
for speculation and gossip about the first ``Star Wars'' film in 16
years.
</P>
<P>
   Newsdroid (www.newsdroid.com), subtitled Headline News for Star
Wars Fans, recently explored the persistent rumor that Jake Lloyd,
the child actor who portrays Darth Vader as a boy in the new film,
has had his speaking parts redone by another child actor. On
Holocron, articles delve into such weighty topics as similarities
between ``Star Wars'' and ``Gone With the Wind.'' One writer notes,
for example, that in ``Star Wars'' the ``empire enslaves entire
planets; the South enslaved an entire race.''
</P>
<P>
   On several sites there is a petition drive to have a special
card in a ``Star Wars'' board game be made to honor the memory of
Steven Curnow, a 14-year-old ``Star Wars'' fan who was shot and
killed at Columbine High School in April in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Practically every other mouse click on these sites leads to
downloadable ``Star Wars'' photographs, screen savers, sounds,
animated graphics, fan-made movie shorts and cartoons. There are
also links to collectibles for sale and trade, backgrounds on
characters, vehicles and weapons, and well-marked ``spoilers'' _
glimpses, with words and sometimes pictures, of the new film's
much-guarded plotline.
</P>
<P>
   Some Webmasters of ``Star Wars'' sites claim to have pirated
versions of the film's shooting script, a kind of bible they use to
weed out wild rumors about how the action unfolds in the film. And
many claim to have vast networks of contacts and spies working on
the film and many of its toy and promotional campaigns who feed the
sites with provocative tidbits.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   When ``Star Wars'' blasted into movie theaters in 1977, the
Internet was hardly a household word; it would be almost 20 years
before the World Wide Web would begin appearing in American homes.
And nowhere among the futuristic light sabers and X-wing fighters
was there a glimpse of anything that even slightly resembled the
Net, which is a shame. If Princess Leia could have just sent the
rebels the stolen plans for the Death Star in an e-mail attachment
(cc: Obi-Wan Kenobi), she could have saved everyone a lot of
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But the Internet and PC-inspired technology appear to be
exerting some influence on the look of the new ``Star Wars'' film,
``The Phantom Menace.'' For example, while there is still no
explicit mention of anything like the Web on exotic planets like
Naboo and Coruscant, there are a series of spiffy view screens that
look like Palm Pilots you might find in a galaxy far, far away.
</P>
<P>
   In tune with the esthetic sensibilities George Lucas has
insisted upon for his ``Star Wars'' films, these view screens have
the decidedly worn, retrofuturistic look of handheld computers that
have seen better days.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's George's whole design philosophy, to make things very
believable,'' said Doug Chiang, director of concept design for
``Phantom.''
</P>
<P>
   The view screens, which Chiang said were not really supposed to
be stand-ins for laptops and such, appear to be fashioned from
alien metals and have organic details, like handles made from
animal bones. One even looks like a cross between a hand mirror and
an old microphone from the golden age of radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're small versions of a TV set,'' Chiang said, adding that
there was no real equivalent of the Internet in the new movie.
Lucas' idea is that technological evolution in the ``Star Wars''
universe occurred quite differently than it did on Earth, Chiang
said.
</P>
<P>
   The view screens, inspired by drawings made by Chiang, are
mostly used in the film to permit characters to see things
difficult to see otherwise, like a child who is far away. The view
screens are somewhat like computer screens linked to Webcams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you see it, but it is never explained in the movie,''
Chiang conceded. ``George doesn't like to focus on the
technology.''

<P>
   TIVOLI, N.Y. _ The lowering sun illuminates the monumental
columns of the Hudson River house like a kindly searchlight.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, even though it is barely past 5 o'clock, the occupants
of the grand house are winding down their activities. Pierre
Moulin, white-haired and 72, who owns Callendar House, has begun to
tire; he is very ill. Mara Prologo, the cook and household major
domo, is heading to her sitting room, a few doors from the
slate-floored kitchen. Two of Moulin's younger friends, David
Graham and Frank Appleton, are buttoning up the house for the
evening.
</P>
<P>
   It was not always this way.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, Moulin and his partner, Pierre LeVec _ the couple
known far and wide as Pierre Deux, as much for their joyous
Provencal style as for the colorful French cottons they sold at
their fabric and antiques emporiums _ bought the late-18th-century
house and its 47 acres. They started inviting friends, relatives
and strangers for parties and teas, and for concerts in the old
emerald-green carriage house north of the main house. These genteel
revels often crowded the midnight hour, and just as often, passed
it by.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with great regret, Moulin has decided to part with
Callendar House, and he has spent a mellow Saturday afternoon
recounting the highlights of his decade there. The house, he said
with a sigh, ``is too big for me now.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Pierres first saw the house, they had just sold the
Pierre Deux fabrics line. Antiques dealers as well as fabric
importers, they thought they might end up in France or perhaps
somewhere near Woodbury, Conn., a town full of dealers, with an
auction house. If they chose France, Moulin would be home; he was
born near Paris. LeVec was born in St. Louis. ``I am French, so I
am Pierre,'' Moulin explained. ``He was American so I called him
Pete.'' LeVec had suggested Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, friends had begged them to look at Callendar
House, one of the few great Hudson River mansions still in private
hands: it was built by Henry Gilbert Livingston, whose country seat
was next door. He promptly sold off the new house _ to a relative
who, in the 1830s, added the house's most memorable feature, the
Greek Revival colonnade across the front, overlooking the river to
the west and, to the south, the river's North Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We grumbled all the way up,'' Moulin remembered. He was
ensconced in a worn plaid armchair next to a rip-roaring fire in
the little first-floor study; a pug named Fred rested its many
chins on his ankle. ``It was rainy and dreary and much too far to
drive and on and on and on.''
</P>
<P>
   But they adored the house, although they found the furnishings
``not completely to our taste,'' Moulin said, with obvious tact.
``It was not a happy house _ it was not whimsical. But the bones
were there. When we retired, we wanted to have the homestead, with
the dog, with the friends and the children.'' (Although he speaks
English with near perfection, Moulin retains his French accent,
along with a certain Gallic habit of adding ``the'' before a few of
his nouns.)
</P>
<P>
   So they bought Callendar House (which a former owner, Jean de
Castella, who raised thoroughbred race horses there, had renamed
Tivoli) and immediately began to turn it into a homestead. They
cleared vistas through overgrown scrub. They planted fruit trees.
They did over every room, recreating elegant bedrooms overlooking
the Hudson, the canopy beds laden with their country cottons. (In
Moulin's bedroom, a wall was taken out to double the size; the
canopy posts, hidden by yards of material, are really steel
pillars, supporting the 10-foot ceiling.)
</P>
<P>
   They replaced most of the fireplace mantels _ which Moulin is
sure were turn-of-the-century replacements, too brown and heavy for
the sunny house _ preferring 18th- and 19th-century French marble
mantels. In the downstairs hall, which bisects the house from front
to back, they installed elegant 18th-century boiserie, shipped from
Paris by a friend, who to this day refuses to say where he found it
_ except that it was ``a little chateau in Provence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to put down black and white marble on the floor,''
said Moulin, who used a walker to gallantly escort a reporter
around the first floor. ``But not only was it heavy, but it was a
little too expensive for us at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they had the floor painted a trompe l'oeil parquet de
Versailles. ``It didn't come out too badly,'' he said, gazing down
the hall through the Federal arched doorway, across the columned
porch, across the spring-green lawn and down to the sparkling wide
river beyond.
</P>
<P>
   The very first year the two men lived in the house (only the
dining room was finished, with the same blue-and-white fabric,
brushed blue china cupboard and Chinese rug it has now) they held
their inaugural Bastille Day party, an annual event that continued
until LeVec's death a year and a half ago.
</P>
<P>
   For another party in those early years, they unveiled their
restoration of the sitting room, the 45-by-25-foot living room
added to the first floor by McKim Mead &AMP; White when the firm
remodeled the house around 1910. The room's walls had been the
source of debate: Moulin said he didn't know what to do with the
eccentric murals _ owls, ferns and fronds, scattered about the
rough brown plaster _ painted in 1921, the first commission of Olin
Dows, a young Harvard graduate, who was a weekend guest at
Callendar House.
</P>
<P>
   The walls, truth to tell, had gotten a bit dingy, and in the
end, the murals were freshened and the furnishings chosen to
complement the airy combination of blue-grey and brick red. The
resulting scheme, with its baby-blue linen sofas and an elaborate
brick-colored birdcage with a pale blue door, is one of the few in
the house that are devoid of the jolly, primitive French cotton
prints so associated with the Pierre Deux name.
</P>
<P>
   Although the house is indubitably American, a combination of
Mount Vernon and Gracie Mansion, most of the furnishings are
French. Moulin makes a case _ perhaps a shade defensively _ that
the Frenchification of Callendar House is in keeping with
Lafayette's visits to the surrounding countryside, bringing
wagonloads of French furnishings and accessories as petits cadeaux:
extravagant house gifts for his hosts.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are fine Hudson River landscapes,'' Graham said during a
tour of the house, gesturing to four small paintings hung in each
corner of the dining room. ``They are four of the only American
things in the house.'' (Then, to his credit, he laughed: ``Did you
ever see `Lettuce and Lovage,' the play where the tour guide makes
it up as she goes along? I pride myself as an expert at it!'')
</P>
<P>
   Then Moulin, tired from his battle with cancer but ever the
host, shouted that it was teatime. His guest sat sipping tea from
fragile canary-yellow porcelain cups painted with yellow and red
flowers, a wedding gift to his mother. Under Mrs. Prologo's
watchful eye, the group ate freshly baked butter cookies. (``I
really can't have any of those,'' Moulin said wistfully, then
succumbed to just one.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Moulin said he decided to put Callendar House on the market
``right away.'' (It seemed too gauche to ask him the price; Heather
Croner, the Millbrook real estate agent who is handling the
property, said it is $4 million.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very difficult decision,'' he explained. ``I thought
of selling it when Pete died, but I've had so many friends who did
it too fast, and made the wrong decision. I waited.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, it is because of my own health,'' he continued. ``If I am
lucky to do well, I would like to travel, and this big estate is
difficult to care for, even with good people. So I have enjoyed the
Callendar, but it is too big for me now. If I could find the person
who falls in love with it, I would be happy.'' He paused.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you know, now that I've decided to sell, I don't want to
make the big drama,'' he said. ``First, because I love it too much.
And second, why not just make a clean break? I am hoping so much
that the next people will love it the way I do, and will, also,
make it a real homestead. The way Pete and I did.''

BUDDHIST PRINCIPLES HELP WORKERS COPE, AUTHOR SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JESSIE MILLIGAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As if you didn't have enough to do every day at work, now comes
this:
</P>
<P>
   Enlightenment under fluorescent lights.
</P>
<P>
   Nirvana at the budget meeting.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as unlikely as it sounds. Centuries-old Eastern thought
and relaxation techniques may be the answers to the various ills of
the working life, where stress, jealousy, greed and various deadly
sins often abound.
</P>
<P>
   That's according to Massachusetts author Llama Surya Das, who
says the workplace is one of the most rewarding places to practice
Tibetan Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
   Das is busy hyping his newest book, ``Awakening to the Sacred,
Creating a Spiritual Life From Scratch'' (Broadway Books, $26), now
in bookstores. If the mantra sounds a little familiar, it's because
the author hit the religion charts in 1997 with ``Awakening the
Buddha Within, Eight Steps to Enlightenment'' (Broadway Books).
</P>
<P>
   Das, a self-described Long Island Jewish boy named Jeffrey
Miller, left his American self behind in the 1970s and spent nearly
30 years in Asia studying Tibetan and Zen Buddhism. He recently
returned stateside, transformed as an author and seminar leader.
</P>
<P>
   In his books, Das distills the ancient philosophies of Buddhism
_ meditation, breathing exercises, yoga _ into simple techniques
that time-stressed Americans can practice.
</P>
<P>
   Even short, spiritual pauses help establish awareness and make
us better at dealing with stressful situations, he says. No more
hurling curses at a jammed computer printer. No more sneering at
the boss. You can't do that while breathing deeply.
</P>
<P>
   Das calls the technique ``tapping into our innate sanity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some say God is everywhere and we can connect any time. In
Buddhism, we connect with something that is already within us. ...
Rather than feeling lost or scattered, we feel grounded,'' Das
says.
</P>
<P>
   Das believes that fewer people today are inclined to follow a
dogma-based religion, in which a sense of the sacred is confined to
one hour on the Sabbath and hope for divine help is saved for the
afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he says, many people are seeking spiritual improvement
that they can feel in the here and now, every day, even at work.
</P>
<P>
   Buddhism in the workplace is a way of affirming what Buddhists
call ``right livelihood,'' he says. Work is not just a way to earn
a paycheck. Work is what we do to make a better world and make
ourselves better people. Work should be ethical, nonviolent and
done with subdued passion, he says.
</P>
<P>
   With that philosophy, Das becomes something of an anti-Dilbert,
trading cynicism for niceness and hope, and replacing competition
with collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all need to make a life, not a living,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Here is a sample of Llama Surya Das' tips for surviving the
workplace:
</P>
<P>
   The loving kindness exercise: ``Visualize your boss and bathe
him in light. As you do this, chant these words to yourself, `May
you be happy, may you be peaceful, may you be fulfilled.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The boss-meditation is calming and allows you to become a better
person even if it doesn't help the boss, Das says. (And it probably
is more effective than that old non-Buddhist technique of simply
picturing him in his underwear.)
</P>
<P>
   The minimeditation exercise: ``Stop what you are doing and just
sit there. Relax and just drop everything. Breathe in and out,
slowly, three times through your nose, paying attention to each
breath.''
</P>
<P>
   Give yourself three minutes if you can, or try the even simpler
version: 15 seconds during which you breathe, smile and relax three
times in a row. You can do it at a meeting. Breathe in and pull in
wisdom, goodness and patience; breathe out the bad forces of
contempt, rejection and the taste of old, stale office coffee.
</P>
<P>
   The haiku exercise: Haiku helps the writer focus on a subject or
emotion and simplify it. It is a form of meditation. Traditionally,
a haiku is composed in three lines, with the first line containing
five syllables, the second seven syllables and the last five
syllables, such as:
</P>
<P>
   Frustrating Monday,
</P>
<P>
   I am fixing to go home.
</P>
<P>
   Who blocked my car in?
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The Buddhist approach to asking for a raise: There is no
Buddhist approach to asking for a raise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buddha was born to a wealthy family, but walked away from it
all to search for enlightenment. So Buddhism doesn't have a whole
lot of advice for those seeking wealth as opposed to knowledge.''
</P>

TERRIFYING PRECISION, JUST FOR FUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm trapped inside a 50,000-square-foot, three-dimensional comic
strip. Spiderman jumps down onto the hood of my high-tech
reporter's vehicle with a thump and warns me that Doctor Octopus
and his evil henchpersons are running amok in Gotham. But my editor
at The Daily Bugle says I've got to get the story.
</P>
<P>
   In the next six minutes, I'm nearly crushed by a Dumpster,
decapitated by a flying pipe, electrocuted, drowned in a sewer,
blown up by an exploding pumpkin bomb and shredded by a
sharp-taloned villainess. My car is sent spinning over the rooftops
by an antigravity gun, and suddenly I'm plunging straight down, 50
stories _ at which point, even though I know I'm on a perfectly
safe ride at Universal Studios' new Islands of Adventure theme park
in Orlando, Fla., I hear myself screaming.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Spiderman saves me from certain death by lassoing
my falling vehicle just as I'm composing my own obituary. And just
as fortunately, the $100 million worth of highly advanced and
experimental technology that went into creating the Spiderman 3-D
ride works almost without a hitch.
</P>
<P>
   But Scott Trowbridge, one of the technical masterminds behind
the ride, is not particularly pleased. Some of the lasers did not
fire on cue, the ride vehicle muffed some moves and the
psychoacoustic 3-D sound system malfunctioned.
</P>
<P>
   Computers reel off error messages, pagers buzz and 900-megahertz
radios crackle as technicians scurry on catwalks and prowl through
catacombs of digital equipment. Everyone is racing to fix all the
glitches before the new park officially opens next week.
</P>
<P>
   Spiderman is just one of several rides and attractions at
Islands of Adventure that simply could not have been created,
designed, built or operated without computers.
</P>
<P>
   The importance of technology in entertainment these days arises
in part from a long tradition of creative people taking advantage
of new technological tools to tell stories. But on another level,
it requires ever-more advanced technology to impress a generation
of consumers who have grown up with computer-generated 3-D graphics
and dazzling movie special effects.
</P>
<P>
   Theme park rides, blockbuster movies and even new computer game
titles are becoming multimillion-dollar science projects. The mad
scientists at Universal have spent their millions well, judging
from all the adrenaline they extract from visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the turn of the last century, electricity and magnets were
the most advanced technologies at amusement parks,'' said
Trowbridge, who describes himself as ``a bit of a geek.'' ``People
would see tricks done with magnets and they would go away and talk
about it for months. These days, we can't just float a paper clip
over a magnet. Our audiences are much more sophisticated.''
</P>
<P>
   The new Incredible Hulk roller coaster ride at Universal,
Trowbridge points out, is not your grandfather's roller coaster,
the kind that slowly climbs, ka-klunk, ka-klunk, ka-klunk, up a
steep incline until at the peak it noses over into a
gravity-induced plunge.
</P>
<P>
   No, this one blasts upward from the starting ramp with the force
of a jet fighter taking off from an aircraft carrier. At
four-and-a-half Gs of acceleration I don't even have enough breath
to scream before we spin, upside down, into a 360-degree weightless
loop _ the first of many.
</P>
<P>
   The launching sequence for the Hulk hammers the electrical grid
with 6,000 amps, so much energy, Trowbridge tells me, that if it
depended on the power supply that the rest of Orlando uses, lights
all around the city would dim each time it catapulted another
carload of happily terrified vacationers into space.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent these antisocial power gulps, Universal engineers
built a separate power plant just for the Hulk that sucks
electricity from the city at a steady rate and stores it in four
massive, 10,000-pound flywheels.
</P>
<P>
   Laser beams bounce off the backs of the cars to measure position
and acceleration, arrays of sensors along the tracks measure
friction and calculate weight, and at the precise moment when the
launch control computers determine that all is ready and safe, the
pent-up energy is released in a sudden burst.
</P>
<P>
   Even the sound of the roller coaster is digitally enhanced, to
make the cars growl and shriek as they career around the track. As
if more shrieking were needed.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Just as with the Spiderman ride, everything on the Hulk is timed
to the millisecond, and every incoming data stream is analyzed by
at least two different computers. If any of them detects the
slightest variation from the norm, the system stops and pagers
start vibrating on the belts of park administrators, engineers and
technicians all over the park.
</P>
<P>
   Universal is even thinking about renting pagers to the guests,
delivering up-to-the-minute information on waiting times at each
attraction or restaurant, weather reports and interactive maps. The
staff at the park's hotels could page a wandering guest if a
message or phone call arrived at the front desk.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, pagers would have to be left behind on the Dueling
Dragons roller coaster ride, actually a matched pair of
intertwining tracks that, again thanks to precise synchronization
made possible by banks of computers and sensors, make it appear
that two rival groups of riders are going to collide at a combined
speed of more than 100 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball caps, sunglasses and other articles of clothing go
flying. Riders are not allowed to wear sandals, which would be
flung off by the G-forces. (For maximum thrills, ride the front row
of the blue ``dragon.'')
</P>
<P>
   Next door, in Poseidon's Adventure, visitors enter the lost city
of Atlantis through a 25-foot tunnel of water without getting wet.
</P>
<P>
   Over in Jurassic Park, Spar Aerospace, a Canadian company that
built the giant robotic arm used on the space shuttle fleet, was
enlisted to help Universal create Sarah the baby triceratops, an
animatronic beast about the size of a minivan that is one of the
most realistic robotic dinosaurs ever built.
</P>
<P>
   How real is it? ``It sneezes, it snorts, it urinates, it
flatulates and goop comes out of its nostrils,'' said Tom Williams,
president of Universal Studios Florida Escape, which encompasses
all of Universal's vacation operations in the state. Everything _
its skin texture; its eyes, which dilate; to its puffs of breath,
synchronized with the movement of the rib cage, its bellows and
whimpers _ is the result of pushing technology to its current
limits.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent preview, children in the audience, and even some
adults, momentarily forgot that dinosaurs have been extinct for 65
million years.
</P>
<P>
   But the T. Rex of the new park _ that's a ``T'' as in technology
_ is Spiderman. ``This project was such a beast,'' Trowbridge said.
``We were inventing technology and inventing processes as we
went.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spiderman ride takes carloads of 12 people, all wearing
special polarized sunglasses, through what is in effect a
combination fun house and movie theater. Multiple sets of twin,
high-speed 70-mm film projectors have precise timing, as they flash
3-D scenes on both flat and curved Imax-sized surfaces in front of
the cars as they pass.
</P>
<P>
   The polarized glasses blend the images and create the illusion
that the viewer is inside the scene. Hence, Spiderman can seem to
land on the hood of the car as it moves.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the car is moving is the real challenge for 3-D
effects, which normally require the viewer to be sitting in a fixed
spot to achieve the illusion of being inside a three-dimensional
space. Trowbridge and his crew developed ways to dynamically
distort the 3-D films in a way that tracks the movement of the
cars, the first time that has been done in such a setting. The
result is that everyone in the car stays in the 3-D world as the
car loops, spins and races along the track.
</P>
<P>
   It makes going back into the real three-dimensional world seem
rather tame.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The door opens on an empty stage, a world clean out
of love. Into this inhospitable domain, the symbolic habitat of a
barren upbringing, marches Dael Orlandersmith, imposing in shape,
and even more so in the shape of her suffering.
</P>
<P>
   For the duration of ``The Gimmick,'' her scorching new solo
piece, Ms. Orlandersmith fills the New York Theater Workshop with
the outsize proportions of her formidable fury. She fills the space
with other things, too: a rhapsodic embrace of language; the
memories of a hobbled cast of Harlem characters brought low by
drugs, booze and hopelessness, and an absolutely iron-fisted
determination to lay on you something of the sting of pitiless
rebuke slapped on her throughout her ``why me?'' of a childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Orlandersmith has touched on aspects of this tale in her
previous one-person shows. But works like the 1996 ``Monster,'' in
which she explored her precocious sense of alienation, now seem to
have been mere rehearsals for the more nuanced narrative of ``The
Gimmick,'' which opened last night. It is no exaggeration to say
that in this production, ably directed by Chris Coleman, Ms.
Orlandersmith practices a kind of verbal Impressionism; as if to
intensify the rainbow of moods she communicates, the words for the
various colors she describes in the piece are projected
intermittently onto the back wall of the stage.
</P>
<P>
   The literalness of this device has a clear purpose, linking the
stories of the two main characters of ``The Gimmick,'' a pair of
ghetto friends, Alexis and Jimmy, who grow up in abject parental
neglect but nevertheless aspire to careers as a writer and a
painter. It is through her alter ego of Alexis, deserted
emotionally by an alcoholic single mother, forced to eke out a
rage-stoked existence in her psychic orphanhood, that Ms.
Orlandersmith helps an audience to see all the colors of her
struggle. It is through Jimmy, a gifted artist who is demeaned,
beaten and ultimately egged on to drugged oblivion by a
spite-driven father, that the actress seeks to illustrate a tragedy
of Harlem in more mysterious shades of gray.
</P>
<P>
   Alexis' obsession with Jimmy is the least involving aspect of
``The Gimmick'' _ of all the characters portrayed by Ms.
Orlandersmith, Jimmy is the only one who fails to pass the
believability test _ but it is a minor failing; Jimmy remains a
useful receptacle for Alexis' bottomless pool of yearning, a
condition brought on by Alexis' intense sense of isolation, a
state, in Ms. Orlandersmith's crystalline phrasing, of feeling
``cold low alone.'' It is, in fact, in these characterizations of
Alexis' interior life that ``The Gimmick'' unveils an unflagging
power to enlighten. At times the illumination is almost blinding.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Orlandersmith is unapologetically large; in a shapeless
black smock and long, gold and straw-colored braids, she's a vision
of self-assertiveness. Alexis is the name she gives, in a sense, to
her own embryonic artistic ego, and one can clearly sense, as
Alexis grows in Ms. Orlandersmith's telling into young adulthood,
the hard shell being constructed by this secretly soft and easily
wounded young girl. (The armor must be applied before it can be
removed again.) Wandering at Jimmy's instigation, for example, into
an East Side boutique to buy a dress, Alexis absorbs the brunt of
the white establishment's contempt; the saleswoman trots over with
the only item in her size, a man's extra large shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world,'' she says, ``does not like big black girls at all,
not at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexis arms herself against the cruelties of this world,
perceived and real, and over the course of the 85-minute show, Ms.
Orlandersmith details both her escapes from and confrontations with
her own consuming anger. The show tracks her development from about
the age of 8 to adulthood; her pique is continuous. There is a
wonderfully revealing interlude on a Manhattan street in which
Alexis, embittered over Jimmy's romantic defection, takes her
revenge on a random white girl, throwing her intimidating body in
the girl's path and subjecting her to a barrage of epithets. In an
internal monologue, the speaking voice of her more vulnerable self,
Alexis expresses utter revulsion at her own callousness.
</P>
<P>
   Comfort is available, too, however, in the form of a
compassionate librarian at Alexis' library branch. Encouraging the
youngster's infatuation with learning, the librarian becomes
surrogate mother and tutor. She is the only adult to impart
anything like affection, and one of the marvels of ``The Gimmick''
is the demonstration that a tiny droplet of tenderness is all the
encouragement the needy little girl requires to survive, to nourish
her desire to live outside and beyond her outrage.
</P>
<P>
   Lighted by Matthew Frey with a feel for the dignity of Ms.
Orlandersmith's terrible and touching anecdotes, ``The Gimmick'' is
designed as a sharp reflection of a writer's cold-eyed communion
with her world. (The meaning to her of ``black'' is conveyed with
exactly the right grammatical subtlety in one of the projections.)
In their particulars, the tales she tells may not seem startlingly
unfamiliar; again and again, readers and movie- and playgoers have
lived vicariously through this kind of struggle. But Ms.
Orlandersmith is herself wholly original, a riveting combatant in a
story, like all war stories, that stamps her as one who has been
there.

<P>
   CARPINTERIA, Calif. _ Splendor among the oaks, especially in the
secretive canyons winding up into the mountains of Southern
California, comes with the sobering caveat of fire _ walls of it,
superheated and deadly. The house that embraces nature here must
also defend itself from her tinderbox.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a Catch-22 to living in these canyons,'' said Los
Angeles architect Barton Myers, who just completed a fire-resistant
steel house here, 10 miles south of Santa Barbara. ``Living in
paradise gets edgy at times.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially after the Malibu and Santa Barbara fires of the last
decade, anyone building a house high in the California hills must
factor fire prevention into the design, which is already freighted
with rules about earthquake resistance, mud slides and energy
saving. But how can homes conceived with a heart open to the
outdoors abruptly change into closed fortresses when choppers pass
overhead telling everybody to evacuate?
</P>
<P>
   Fresh from completing the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in
Newark, Myers was living comfortably in the Hollywood Hills of Los
Angeles with his wife, Vicki, in a Spanish-style house once owned
by the serial-arts widow Alma Mahler Gropius Werfel. (Her last
husband, Franz Werfel, wrote the novel ``Song of Bernadette'' in
the house.) On summer weeknights, strains of the Los Angeles
Philharmonic wafted up from the Hollywood Bowl, but on weekends,
rock concerts blasted the couple out of the house and into weekend
exile. ``The decibel reading equaled the runway at LAX with 747s
taking off,'' said Myers, a former Air Force pilot.
</P>
<P>
   On one trip, they found a 40-acre patch of storybook heaven for
sale in the hills of Carpinteria: rushing stream, stands of
centenarian oaks and a distant view of the Pacific, which the
afternoon sun can transform into a hypnotic silver platter.
</P>
<P>
   The Myerses had a love of loftlike spaces and the notion of
building a house of steel. Inspired by the Case Study house that
Charles and Ray Eames built in 1949 in Pacific Palisades, Myers
wanted to erect a steel house from off-the-shelf parts. In Toronto,
some 30 years ago, he built a town house for his family from a kit
of metal parts; in Carpinteria he wanted to revisit the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Myers' primary thought was to save the natural beauty he and his
wife had come to savor. To reduce the impact of the building, he
broke it down into three pavilions: a main house, a guest house and
a studio. By not putting the compound in a dominant position at the
top of the hill, and by siting the pavilions between trees, he was
able to build without felling a single oak.
</P>
<P>
   An abundance of water on the property allowed Myers to make the
roofs of the pavilions into shallow, gravity-fed ponds that terrace
down the hillside. Seen from the flank of the hill, the pools merge
visually with the ocean in the distance. ( Myers likens the roofs
to the reflecting pools of Persian gardens.) Each roof pool spills
into a holding trough, which can be used as a backup reservoir in
case of fire. He deepened the long edge of the pond in front of the
main house to create a lap pool. ``I earned a degree in plumbing on
this project,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Just below the edge of each roof, the architect has placed long
metal tubes containing steel shutters, which roll down over the
windows for fire protection (and security). The vast glass front
walls themselves roll up like the doors on fire stations. With the
doors up, ``nature is the room here,'' Myers said. The steel
shutters can be closed in 5 or 10 minutes into a tight,
self-protective steel cocoon, under planes of water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the horrendous track record of fires here, we're finally
getting smarter,'' he said. Steel made sense to Myers not only
because of its fire resistance but also because it can span wide
distances. Those spans give the pavilions almost outdoor
dimensions. The voluminous main space, supported on eight columns
at the edge of the room, is 60 feet long, 20 feet wide and 17 feet
high.
</P>
<P>
   Myers put the three bedrooms in what he calls a caboose off the
main house: a 100-foot run that extends in a line to give two
bedrooms an ocean view. Chimneys house heat pumps and fireplace
ducts.
</P>
<P>
   The overall effect is a loft walled in glass, and in the two
bedrooms with rolling doors, great openness to the outside. Indeed,
many creatures, what Myers calls ``the convention of animals,''
find little difference between outside and in. ``I don't mind the
rodents,'' Mrs. Myers said. ``I don't like the scorpions so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Myers said he was ``not happy about snakes'' and is not about to
raise the double rolling garage doors, front and back, on the
master bedroom at night _ mountain lions and coyotes roam these
parts.
</P>
<P>
   Steel-frame houses have dotted architectural history since World
War II. The conceit espoused by their designers is that they come
off the delivery truck and are assembled in hours, at a reasonable
cost and without fuss. The underlying wish is that they could solve
mass housing problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Case-Study architects of the 1950s failed to convince
contractors that this was an inexpensive way to build. ``It's still
difficult to build with industrial components unless you're working
with a commercial contractor,'' Myers said. The technology is
beyond most contractors, especially with today's seismic
requirements. Anyone doing a house like this has got to be either
rich or clever.
</P>
<P>
   To bring it in at a price he could afford, Myers had to be
clever. Living in an Airstream trailer on site, he served as his
own contractor and had a retired construction manager with years of
experience of building in steel. Custom houses in the area easily
run $200 a square foot. He was able to bring in the
6,000-square-foot house at $150 a square foot, or about $900,000.
</P>
<P>
   Steel, though it may not burn, does melt in great heat. The
Myerses had to think about vegetation as well. With their landscape
architect, Doug Richardson, a botanist, they cleared the uphill
side of the property to make a 200-foot firebreak. In that
reclaimed land, they have created a garden of vegetables and
fruits, including a small vineyard. It adds up to a small family
farm, which somehow seems right for this California house.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   On weekends, Mrs. Myers gardens on terraces where olive trees
alternate with blood oranges. Tuna cactus and the tenacious, deeply
rooted vetiveria grass reduce the fire hazard and help stabilize
the hillside.
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding the lush, English-garden landscaping that characterizes
estates in nearby Montecito, the Myerses lean instead toward a more
Japanese sensibility, especially the serene rock gardens designed
by Isamu Noguchi. Myers used cyclopean boulders to shore up
terraces in front of each pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   With smaller rocks, he created a curving, low-maintenance stream
bed that channels water at the foot of the hillside. He conceived
the roof of the garage as a Zen rock garden, and is leaving what he
calls ``the plaza'' in front of the house like an old hacienda
courtyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without any grass, the plain surfaces connect very beautifully
to the Santa Barbara stone,'' he said. ``With the houses between
the existing oaks, it feels like an older site.''
</P>
<P>
   But how does the house behave on a sunny spring afternoon? An
eight-foot kitchen wall to one side of the main room subdivides the
loft into a large space and a more intimate sitting area. A bar
with California wines is lodged in the library wall. Folk figures,
hand carved and painted in Mexico, look on from the bookshelves. A
refectory table in the living area was once used to serve monks in
Canada. Mrs. Myers has furnished the house sparsely with country
antiques: a magnificent pine four-poster bed once warmed the steel
house in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   There is a 270-degree panorama here, and all the views are
majestic. With the walls of glass thrown open, the main pavilion
becomes a large outdoor room, scaled to nature outside.
</P>
<P>
   Of the dozen or so well-known steel houses built after World War
II, some, like Mies van der Rohe's Farnsworth House outside
Chicago, are so refined that there are few windows to open: Mies
kept the form pure by purging knobs and pesky widgets. Even the
Eames house has only a few sliding doors. The Myerses can slide
doors open, fly them up or just pivot them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mine is more like a Japanese house, where you can change all
the openings,'' Myers said. ``In the end, you don't want the
building to feel like a machine. You want it to feel like a home.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the ``American Century'' exhibition that just opened at the
Whitney Museum of American Art, the first five decades of the 20th
century are represented by nearly 1,000 artworks, plus a few dozen
carefully culled examples of the decorative arts and industrial
design.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, the design objects are used to underscore points made by
the art, as if to say, ``The artists don't lie; this is how the
world truly looked.'' Gerald Murphy's bright, montagelike 1920s
paintings of safety razors and cocktail shakers, for example, share
space with actual cocktail sets.
</P>
<P>
   But smack in the middle of one gallery is a big, undulating
display case stocked with streamlined products, most from the
1930s. Suddenly, the design objects are the stars, and the art
plays a supporting role.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real moment in which the decorative arts take a
leadership position in describing the values of the times,'' said
Barbara Haskell, the show's curator, explaining why these
once-mundane items deserve to be center stage.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it seems strange that these appliances have made their
way from America's kitchens and broom closets and into the museum's
vitrines. Not that these objects are obscure; on the contrary, most
of them have been shown before. The Petipoint iron, manufactured in
1941 by Waverly Tool Co. of Sandusky, Ohio, and the 1937 Electrolux
vacuum cleaner, humble as they may appear, are both alumni of the
Brooklyn Museum's 1986 ``Machine Age in America 1918-1941''
exhibition. Kem Weber's 1934 Zephyr digital clock was in the ``What
Modern Was'' show mounted by Montreal's Museum of Decorative Arts
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   While great works of art are relatively rare, great products _
ones that speak eloquently of their time _ should be abundant. Yet
certain objects have been exhibited repeatedly and gain stature
with each public exposure. The Model 302 telephone by Henry
Dreyfuss is, by now, almost as familiar as Grant Wood's ``American
Gothic.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Kaplan, the associate director of Miami Beach's wildly
eclectic Wolfsonian design collection, was one of the consultants
who gave recommendations to Ms. Haskell. While Ms. Kaplan can offer
no single theory to explain why certain objects achieve masterpiece
status, she maintains that products had to be seductive to sell in
the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Stayton, the curator of decorative arts at the Brooklyn
Museum, also a consultant on the ``American Century,'' said that he
and his colleagues didn't intend to promote such familiar objects.
``We said, `Let's not pull up the chestnuts,' '' he recalled. ``But
when you're trying to tell a story, the reason there are chestnuts
is because they tell it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The real issue, then, is which story you want to tell. Ms.
Kaplan points out that during the 1920s and '30s, a period the
Whitney links with the ascent of modernism, a revival of colonial
style was in full swing. As Loewy and Dreyfuss sculptured an
aerodynamic future, John D. Rockefeller Jr. was busy rebuilding the
past at Colonial Williamsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, each consultant had favorite objects that didn't make
the cut. For Stayton, it was the 1927 coffee service called ``The
Lights and Shadows of Manhattan'' by the Danish silversmith Erik
Magnussen. Stayton is intrigued by the way it translates the
``visual impact of Cubism into the decorative arts.'' Ms. Kaplan
couldn't talk the Whitney into a 1930s reproduction of an
18th-century settee by Wallace Nutting, the leading proponent of
neo-colonial style, but she did secure a place for a largely unsung
meat slicer, Model No. 410, a k a the Streamliner, designed by one
Egmont Arens and made by Hobart in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I love about the meat slicer,'' said Ms. Kaplan, noting
that streamlining was a technique for cutting wind resistance in
trains and airplanes, ``is that it's the ultimate example of a
streamlined form in an object that isn't going anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   But this meat slicer is going places. It had its debut in the
Wolfsonian's 1995 opening exhibition in Miami Beach, which then hit
the road. ``Everywhere it went, people loved it,'' Ms. Kaplan said.
Now, the Streamliner is on display at one of New York's leading
museums. No telling where it will go next. The world is its deli
counter.

<P>
   A house roof has joints between roof sections and around vents,
skylights and chimneys. These joints are vulnerable to leaking
because they usually connect different materials that expand and
contract at dissimilar rates. The joints may also separate as the
house settles.
</P>
<P>
   Builders protect these joints by covering them with flashing, a
flexible material like aluminum, copper, galvanized steel or
neoprene, to repel rain and snow. As long as the flashing remains
intact, the joints will be impervious to moisture, but with
continued exposure to the elements some deterioration is bound to
occur.
</P>
<P>
   An annual spring roof inspection should include a close
examination of the flashing as well as the shingles. Naturally,
this entails climbing up on the roof. Choose a warm, dry day for
this, and wear shoes with nonskid soles. Do not attempt to climb on
the roof if it has a steep pitch or if you are unsteady on heights.
</P>
<P>
   Flashing with extensive damage should be replaced; this is a job
for a professional. Minor damage, a small hole or a patch of
corrosion here and there, can be patched. You can usually make the
repair yourself by cutting a patch from the same material as the
flashing. First, measure the damaged area, then cut a patch large
enough to cover it. Make sure the patch is broad enough to extend
under the shingles on either side of the damaged area.
</P>
<P>
   Lift up the shingles (be careful; if they are cold they will
crack) to break the seal around the flashing, then use a stiff
putty knife and wire brush to clean the flashing of dirt, rust and
old roofing cement. Apply a generous bead of new roofing cement to
the back of the patch, then position it so it covers the damaged
area. Slip the edges of the patch under the adjacent shingles.
</P>
<P>
   Press down on the patch to distribute the roofing cement
underneath, then apply a bead of roofing cement around the edges.
Use a putty knife to smooth this bead and feather the edges to the
surrounding area. This will keep the bead from becoming a small dam
on a rainy day.
</P>
<P>
   Vent flashing fits around the plumbing vent pipe that projects
through the roof. This flashing is usually a single piece of
flexible metal with a neoprene collar that hugs the pipe. When vent
flashing is damaged or corroded, it should be replaced. This,
however, is not difficult and well within the skill range of the
average do-it-yourselfer.
</P>
<P>
   First use a pry bar to gently lift the shingles on either side
of the vent. Scrape away any old roofing cement under the shingles
and around the vent pipe. Slip the new flashing over the vent,
making sure the neoprene collar fits tightly around the pipe. Lift
the shingles above and on either side of the pipe and slip the
flashing underneath. The bottom edge of the flashing should overlap
the shingles beneath so it sheds, not traps, water.
</P>
<P>
   Drive a couple of roofing nails along the top edge of the new
flashing. These nails should be placed so they will be covered by
the overlapping shingles. Cover the nailheads with roofing cement
and apply a generous bead of cement under the shingles, then press
the shingles in place.
</P>
<P>
   The flashing around the chimney is complex because it is made up
of a number of pieces. At the foot of the chimney, facing the
eaves, is the front-base flashing. It is a single piece of metal
that bends down over the shingles and covers the first course of
bricks on the chimney. Two tabs bend around on either side of the
chimney.
</P>
<P>
   Opposite this side of the chimney, facing the peak, is another
piece of metal, called the back-base flashing. It is similar to the
front piece except it runs under the roof shingles. The step
flashing covers the lower sides of the chimney. Step flashing is
made up of overlapping pieces of metal that run under the shingles
and bend up the sides of the chimney.
</P>
<P>
   The top seams of the chimney flashing are covered by separate
pieces of metal called counterflashing. The counterflashing is
embedded in the mortar joints of the chimney, and it bends down
over the other flashing elements.
</P>
<P>
   Before replacing the chimney flashing, you must carefully bend
up the counterflashing. Pull back the roof shingles (this is not
necessary with the front-base flashing) and clean away the old
roofing cement. Remove the old flashing and cut new pieces from the
same material. Slip the new piece in place and bend down the
counterflashing. Seal all the seams with roofing cement. Finally,
apply roofing cement to the underside of the shingles and press
them down against the flashing to form a seal. &QL;

<P>
   As quickly as the word ``alienation'' can be attached to the
idea of youth, the image of isolation can be attached to a picture
of the suburbs. Is there an unexplored relationship between them?
It is a question being raised in the aftermath of the Columbine
High School shootings in Littleton, a Denver suburb.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the renegade sprawl of suburbs themselves is
being intensely scrutinized, the troubling vision of a nation
re-pioneered in vast tracts of disconnected communities has
produced uneasy discussion about the psychological disorientation
they might house.
</P>
<P>
   Invented as a solution to the sociological ills of cities,
suburbs now stand accused of creating their own environmental
diseases: lack of character and the grounding principles of
identity, lack of diversity or the tolerance it engenders, lack of
attachment to shared, civic ideals. Increasingly, the newest,
largest suburbs are being criticized as landscapes scorched by
unthoughtful, repetitious building, where, it has been suggested,
the isolations of larger lots and a car-based culture may lead to
disassociation from the reality of contact with other people.
</P>
<P>
   Designers of the new American suburbs, which were created as
havens, say they have largely ignored or avoided one volatile
segment of the population _ teen-agers. In recent conversations,
three dozen urban planners, architects, environmental psychologists
and sociologists, and experts on adolescent development agreed that
specific community planning and special places for teen-agers are
missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're basically an unseen population until they pierce their
noses,'' said William Morrish, a professor of architecture and the
director of the Design Center for American Urban Landscape at the
University of Minnesota. ``They have access to computers and
weaponry. The sense of alienation that might come from isolation or
neglect will have a much larger impact than it might have before.
And there are no questions coming from the design community about
what we can be doing about this. We don't invite them in.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every other special interest has been addressed by
enlightened suburban designers _ the elderly, the disabled,
families with young children. But, said Andres Duany, a planner who
is a leading proponent of the ``new urbanism,'' a model of suburban
design based on principles of traditional towns, ``It's the
teen-agers I always bring up as a question mark.'' Duany said that
he had only once or twice included teen-agers in the public process
of planning a suburban development.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good point,'' he said, as though it were an unlikely
idea. ``I should talk to the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Though teen-agers tend to resist advice and choose their own
turf as a territorial issue of establishing self-identity, most
experts interviewed say that design could constructively anticipate
and accommodate anxieties of adolescence. They agreed that
teen-agers need a place to be able to go to, to congregate in and
to call their own; it is a critical aspect of relieving the awkward
loneliness of adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   Between home and school _ spheres compromised by the presence of
parents or the pressure of performance _ places for teen-agers in
the suburbs are as uncommon as sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a paradoxical situation,'' said Ray Suarez, host of
``Talk of the Nation'' on National Public Radio and author of ``The
Old Neighborhood,'' a study of suburban migration published this
month by The Free Press. ``Parents move there for their children;
their children are dying to get out.''

 UNDATED: get out.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like much of the Western United States, Denver is experiencing
vertiginous suburban growth. From 1990 to 1996, the metropolitan
area expanded by two-thirds, to its current size of 535 square
miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typical of the Denver metro area are the new suburbs, where
`downtown' is a four-way intersection with three shopping centers
and a condo development,'' said Charles Blosten, community services
director for Littleton's city planning division. Highlands Ranch,
Denver's largest suburban development, has its own zip code,
``nothing but rooftops and miles and miles of nothing,'' Blosten
said of the numbing repetitions of housing. ``It's got to affect
people.''
</P>
<P>
   That place has an impact on adolescent development and
socialization, only now beginning to be studied, is accepted by
most experts on the suburbs. ``A culture of impersonality has
developed in the suburbs,'' said Jonathan Barnett, a professor of
city and regional planning at the University of Pennsylvania and
the author of ``The Fractured Metropolis: Improving the New City,
Restoring the Old City, Reshaping the Region'' (HarperCollins,
1996). ``The standard of houses is high, but the standard of
community isn't.'' He added, ``It's most people's impression of
modern life.''
</P>
<P>
   And the people it stands to impress the most may be the
impressionable people growing up there _ children.
</P>
<P>
   Morrish said he thought that public transportation to
metropolitan downtowns was crucial for high-school students. He
said that the ability to access ``the system'' _ the world adults
create _ was a vital form of empowerment.
</P>
<P>
   ``What to do after school, how to get to the city, to see other
people and how to negotiate this without parents,'' he said, posing
the issues. ``Teen-agers have to have better access to the public
realm and public activity.'' He recalled a conversation with a
group of high school students who met with the Design Center, which
invites teen-agers to group meetings when it is commissioned to
study neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``One girl said, `All I've got is the Pizza Hut,''' Morrish
said. `` `You go there a lot or you go to somebody's house _ we're
tired of both.'''
</P>
<P>
   Between home and school, in a landscape drawn by cars and the
adults who drive them, is there even a particular place that
teen-agers can call their own? Peter Lang, a professor of
architecture at the New Jersey Institute of Technology and an
editor of ``Suburban Discipline,'' (Princeton Architectural Press,
1997), a collection of essays, said: ``In most suburbs, there's not
even a decent park, because everyone has a backyard. But older kids
never play in the back yard. They'll find even the crummiest piece
of park.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the students at Columbine High School went to
Southwest Plaza, a two-level mall that has video arcades, food
courts and stores, supervised by security guards and closed by 9
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like any suburban community, there's not a lot of places to go
and hang out,'' Blosten said of Littleton. ``I tell you this
because that's where my daughter goes _ the mall.''
</P>
<P>
   Lang said he thought that places like malls were not adequate
gathering spaces for teen-agers, calling them, like many public
suburban venues, commercially and environmentally ``controlled
space.'' He added, ``They are not places for free expression or
hanging out.''
</P>
<P>
   Disagreeing that suburbs create greater alienation is Dr.
Laurence Steinberg, a professor of psychology at Temple University
and director of the MacArthur Foundation Research Network on
Adolescent Development and Juvenile Justice. But he said that he
thought recent tragedies like the incident in Littleton do ``wake
people up to the notion that there is parental disengagement in
affluent suburbs.'' He added: ``We did a a study on latchkey kids.
The kids most likely to be left unattended for long periods were
middle class, in sprawling professional suburbs. Isolated for long
periods of time, there's no counterbalancing force to fantasy.''
</P>
<P>
   The desire for larger, cheaper lots that has pushed suburbs to
rural exurbia results in teen-agers who are alone for large parts
of the day, or an alternative that may be worse.
</P>
<P>
   Morrish pointed out that in communities like Modesto, in the San
Joaquin valley in central California, people commute to jobs in the
San Francisco area, where they enroll their children in schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people in California are taking their kids with them,''
he said, ``making the kids commute.''
</P>
<P>
   The planners who have been most vocally and visibly at work on
restructuring the suburban model have been ``new urbanists'' like
Duany. Their solutions to the wheeling nebulae of tract development
are based on tighter concentrations of houses, businesses and
public spaces connected by townlike elements _ porches, sidewalks,
and parks _ that have largely disappeared from the new residential
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   If teen-agers find their place there, in new towns like Columbia
and Kentlands in Maryland or Celebration, the Disney-built town in
Florida, it is not because of any bravery on the planners' part.
They often foster nostalgic views of families with young children.
But, like conventional suburbs, they overlook the inevitability of
teen-agers in their design.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Katz, the author, with Vincent Scully, of ``The New
Urbanism: Toward an Architecture of Community'' (McGraw-Hill,
1993), spoke of the importance to teen-agers of a place that
existed only for them, neither hidden and ignored nor exposed and
supervised _ in effect, a secret place in full view.
</P>
<P>
   On a visit, Katz discovered that for Celebration's teen-agers,
it was a narrow bridge, ``with low railings, that goes from
downtown to the health club. They find each other. They sit on the
railing. Cars cruise across the bridge. It's on the route to daily
life _ not a back alley, but not the town square.'' Katz suggested
that such a structure could become a conscious part of a community
design for teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   For Diane Dorney, a mother with two teen-age children who lives
in Kentlands, Md., a 10-year-old ``new urban'' suburb of some 1,800
people, the hallmarks of town life work well for both parents and
children. Ms. Dorney and her husband, Mark, moved their family from
a typical town-house development.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to raise our kids in a place that provided more than
just a house,'' she said. ``It's a diverse community, of age and
income,'' with older people, young couples, families. Ms. Dorneye
said that she thought the gaze of the town created a sense of
extended family and moral weight that were its most important
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone sneaking down the street to have a cigarette _ they
don't get away with it,'' she said. ``I don't think teen-agers
should be left on their own until they're caught at the small
things.'' She added, ``When they go into the big things, they know
how big they are.'' She said: ``And we have another way of knowing
these kids, other than the bad things. They're your neighbors, too.
You're always seeing them. You give them another chance.''

NEW YORK CITY ON SCREEN: LOVE IT OR FIX IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York City begs for simulation. It has been simulated in
movies, books, paintings and avant-garde classical music, not to
mention prime-time television. Inevitably, it has been assembled in
digital media.
</P>
<P>
   But just as there are different visions of the Big Apple on
celluloid, there are different visions of New York in ones and
zeros.
</P>
<P>
   One vision is Sim City 3000, the latest installment in the
best-selling line of virtual metropolis construction kits. Like its
predecessors, Sim City 3000 puts you in the mayor's office of an
urban hub, with all the attendant responsibilities: roads, power
lines, water usage, zoning, public transportation, environmental
policy, education, finance, garbage disposal, traffic,
unemployment, law enforcement and public approval ratings. Build
wisely, and your sim citizens will thrive.
</P>
<P>
   It's an urban planning exercise with good production values.
There are multiple levels of resolution, so you can zoom into
different neighborhoods and see commercial zones filled with
Lilliputian business people, industrial zones speckled with
hard-hat workers and tiny firefighters loitering outside their
stations. Downtown you'll hear traffic. In residential
neighborhoods, you may hear birds chirping and children playing.
</P>
<P>
   But where previous Sim City titles simulated a generic urban
environment, this one allows you to create the Sim City That Never
Sleeps.
</P>
<P>
   Not only can you build on a ready-made terrain that mirrors the
contours of Manhattan, but there are also little landmarks to plant
on the map: Grand Central Terminal, Lincoln Center, the United
Nations, Rockefeller Center and the Statue of Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to include the Chrysler Building and the Guggenheim,
you can download them from the Web site (www.simcity.com), which
recently posted a ``Build Manhattan'' contest for Sim City users.
</P>
<P>
   Would-be Donald Trumps took considerable license. There was
Trihattan, a fanciful version of the city with three downtowns, and
Alotta-Opolis, which incorporates artificial lakes, a wheat field
and a moat surrounding the American Museum of Natural History.
</P>
<P>
   One contestant asked the judges to ``imagine N.Y. with San
Francisco's TransAmerica tower, Houston's 700 Louisiana building,
Hong Kong's Bank of China tower and the Arc de Triomphe in a
relocated Central Park.''
</P>
<P>
   Other players used landmarks from outside New York as place
holders for buildings that aren't available. ``Trump Tower is
represented by Columbia Seafirst Center, and the Citicorp Building
is the 700 Louisiana,'' explained Gergory Jungenberg, a resident of
Long Island City, N.Y. ``Flatiron Building is the Bank of America.
Riker's Island has Alcatraz representing the prison there.
Everything in this city is meticulously accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it isn't. There is no Times Square. The subways are
wrong; they are much better than ours. There's a badly needed
second line on the East Side and plenty of crosstown trains, for
which we all yearn.
</P>
<P>
   There are also palm trees and an inexplicable geyser in Central
Park.
</P>
<P>
   But when you start to examine these model Manhattans block by
block, as a resident, you're looking for another kind of
simulation. You're not interested in the city-as-mechanism, with
all moving parts in order: the traffic lights, the budget, the
waste disposal system. You want to see the city as a mirror of your
memory, as a simulation of your personal experience.
</P>
<P>
   For that sort of simulation, you would do better to examine City
ROM, an annotated digital map of New York published by Small Blue
Planet Atlas Co. Like Sim City, City ROM allows you to zoom into an
aerial view of the city. But unlike the computer game, City ROM's
images are photographic, taken from satellite data. You are not
able to construct and demolish generic buildings. But you are able
to learn about real ones.
</P>
<P>
   Map pointers correspond to images from the photo gallery, which
are linked to text explanations:
</P>
<P>
   ``St. Paul's Chapel. Open 9 a.m.-3 p.m. Mon-Fri, 7 a.m.-3p.m.
Sunday. This is where George Washington went immediately after his
inauguration as the first president of the United States to kneel
and pray for the union.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Chinatown mushroom market, Grand at Elizabeth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Andy Warhol's loft. This loft/studio was owned for many years
by Andy Warhol. Jean-Michel Basquiat, a famous 1980s
painter/poet/graffiti artist and close fiend of Warhol's, rented
the loft before and after Warhol's death. On Aug. 12, 1988,
Basquiat was found dead inside from a drug overdose.''
</P>
<P>
   All these places have addresses listed. In many cases, the phone
numbers are listed as well. You can print maps that show you how to
get there. You can print the photos. Or you can add your own photos
and your own notes, which become another set of color-coded markers
on the map.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few months, you'll be able to swap these cartographic
scrapbooks on City ROM's Web site (www.cityromatlas.com) and show
the world your New York, or see the city through the lens of
someone else's experience. In the real city, you can retrace
someone's steps. Or know that they might be retracing yours,
although there's no way to ascertain whether any route is fact or
fiction. And like the eccentric tour guide in Bennett Miller's film
``The Cruise,'' we are at liberty to use both. In the simulated
city, any story is worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   Both City ROM and Sim City use overlays as a graphic device. In
Sim City you can view water pipes, population density, land values,
crime rates, transportation systems, flora or any combination of
these elements. In City ROM, you can choose to display the map
markers for museums, theaters, restaurants, libraries or your
all-time greatest dates. Both sets of overlays are highly specific.
But they reveal different sorts of truth: the mechanical truth of a
city versus the narrative truth.
</P>
<P>
   It's the difference between a model and a map. A model tells you
that tab A goes into slot B. A map tells you that there be dragons
here.
</P>
<P>
   The former is theory. The latter is memory. Both are imperfect
and incomplete, and that's why they are compelling. They beg us to
tinker, to investigate or to tell stories _ even if they're not
true. So that afterward we can say, ``This is my city because I
built it.'' Or, ``This is my city because I've walked it.'' Or,
``This is my city because I made it up.''
</P>
<P>
   When you build something, or discover something or invent
something, it belongs to you. And who wouldn't lay claim to a few
megabytes of the Big Apple?

<P>
   The recently opened exhibition ``American Century'' at the
Whitney Museum in New York could be subtitled ``See the Last 100
Years of Art With the Technology of the Next.''
</P>
<P>
   The show runs through August, and by June the Whitney, in
collaboration with Intel Corp., plans to offer a new kind of museum
tour for the exhibition. It will involve developing a new
application for a Mitsubishi Pad PC _ a kind of souped-up Palm
Pilot, originally designed for tasks like taking inventory in
factories and warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   Users will carry a Pad PC through the exhibition and, with the
touch of a finger or stylus, have access to audio, text and
high-resolution color video and film programmed to accompany
specific pieces of art. Looking at Alfred Steiglitz's ``Steerage''
photograph of immigrants, for example, a viewer could see film
footage of Ellis Island and a portrait of Steiglitz, then read a
brief biography and listen to audio clips of immigrants who, like
those in the picture, were rejected by the United States and
shipped home.
</P>
<P>
   The modified Pad PC will eventually incorporate a Web browsing
device that will be able to pull information off the museum's Web
site through a wireless network inside the museum. With many of
this country's museums investing millions of dollars building
extensive Web sites, it makes sense for visitors to be able to have
access to that information from inside the galleries.
</P>
<P>
   The Whitney experiment is just one example of how technology is
transforming the museum experience and how museums are using
technology to compete for visitors. Paul Trapido, an independent
museum exhibition designer, developed a device called Arif that has
some of the same features of the Whitney device and is being used
at a science museum in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   A modified Apple Newton, Arif has a Web browser and can run
animation. Trapido's device also allows you to ``save'' items as
you see or hear them. At the end of your tour of the exhibition,
you can walk out with a computer printout of your museum
experience. It is even possible for visitors to load photos of
their faces into the device. Then, when they come to an exhibit of
a helicopter, for example, they can project their own faces into an
image of the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This device allows you to become interactive in a way that's
really personal,'' Trapido said.
</P>
<P>
   Equipping museum visitors with visual devices, however, causes
some consternation among many museum directors, who want visitors
to look at the original object, not a reproduction on some other
object. ``We don't want to monkey around with aura of work of art
by introducing gadgetry,'' said Whitney director Maxwell Anderson,
who described himself as curmudgeonly when it comes to technology
in galleries. ``But we must be open to possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding multimedia devices may not be a matter of choice for
museums if they want to attract young people. ``This is more a
generational issue for me,'' Anderson said. ``My 3-year-old son
grew up playing video games. I need to think about how he's going
to experience an art museum, not old duffers like me.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal of these devices is to enhance the museum experience.
And as museum audio tours have already demonstrated, technology can
lengthen time spent on selected works. On their own, museum
visitors will spend about six seconds looking at the painting,
excluding the time it takes to read the label. With an audio tour,
those same visitors will spend between 60 and 90 seconds on a work
of art.
</P>
<P>
   ``Museum technology is not an oxymoron,'' said Chris Tellis,
chairman of Antenna Audio, one of two companies that dominate the
museum audio tour industry. Tellis' clients include the Louvre, the
Metropolitan Museum, the Rijksmuseum and the National Gallery of
Art in London. ``The technology is supposed to help you have a more
intimate experience with the art,'' Tellis said. ``It's not meant
to get in the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Audio tours have become more sophisticated since the days of
single tapes of a lone museum director droning on. Nor do you have
to follow a prescribed linear course through an exhibition, with
that inevitable cattle-like clumping in front of selected paintings
and neglect of others.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people still think audio tours are art for dummies,
but there's always something to learn with the equivalent of a
half-dozen experts at your side,'' Tellis said.
</P>
<P>
   Today's audio tours are highly produced soundscapes recorded on
CD or other digital hardware that meld music with the voices of
experts and famous actors. Random access lets you hopscotch at your
will through an exhibition: punch in a number of a particular art
object and the tour jumps to the corresponding sound track. Skip
the Monet, linger on the Manet. You can always go back to the main
exhibition narrative. It's like seeing London from a double-decker
tourist bus. You can get off, explore a bit and then get back on
when you're ready.
</P>
<P>
   What if you skip the bus, take a cab and miss the overview? To
insure you hear those can't-miss messages, as you pass from one
gallery to the next, infrared transmitters above the door beam
messages that trigger your device, like ``It's now 1870, and Van
Gogh has moved to Paris,'' or maybe some mood-setting music _
Gregorian chants as you walk into the medieval armor show, for
example. Sometimes, of course, it is a message from the
exhibition's sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Of the half-dozen or so kinds of museum-guide devices available,
the most advanced also have infrared or radio receivers that let
you walk up to a video installation and pick up the audio through
your earphones _ in your own language.
</P>
<P>
   For example, at the Royal Belgium Institute of Natural Sciences
in Brussels, where the antenna audio tour for an exhibition on the
environment is offered in six languages, you can walk up to any one
of nine screens, and in three seconds, your device picks up
infrared signals, allowing the audio to synchronize with the video.
In the language of your choice, video soundtracks on glaciers and
tropical rain forests are piped into your ears. This technology
will soon be available at the Tower of London and the new Museum of
Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Tellis said he foresaw a day when audio tours would offer some
customized features. You might be able to choose the tour narrated
by Philippe de Montebello, your teen-aged son could get one
narrated by Michael Jordan, and the toddler could get Kermit the
Frog.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the devices are becoming lighter and offering
better sound quality. Acoustiguide, another large audio tour
manufacturer, recently introduced a new gadget at the National
Gallery's John Singer Sargent show. Called the Flash System, it
uses flash memory, the kind used in some digital cameras, to
provide clear, skip-free audio accompaniment. This fall, Antenna
Audio plans to introduce the X-plorer, a device that can upload MP3
audio files from the Internet and is small enough to fit in most
patrons' pockets.
</P>
<P>
   With new technology providing a lure to museum-goers, even more
conservative institutions are finding the devices hard to resist.
Last summer, the Frick Collection, housed in a historic mansion
overlooking New York's Central Park, started offering audio tours.
They were not exactly welcomed by many Frick members with headset
bias. ``The Frick is one of the last bastions of nostalgia,'' said
Frick director Samuel Sachs II. ``Things have forever been
unchanging here, including how to portray a work of art to the
viewer.'' Even so, he said that 94 percent of visitors now use the
tours and that ``these tours open worlds of enjoyment that people
might otherwise be missing.''

MOUNTAIN CLIMBING AS A SPECTATOR SPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Peter Dizikes is a freelance writer and recreational climber who
lives in New York.  
 By PETER DIZIKES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Armchair mountaineering is a time-honored tradition among those
seeking vicarious thrills from the comfort of their own homes. In
the last few years, however, it has been supplemented by a new
occupation: desktop mountaineering, the practice of following a
climbing expedition on the Web as its members try to reach the
summit of one of the world's greatest peaks. And May is the
beginning of peak climbing season.
</P>
<P>
   Mount Everest, for instance, has seen a huge increase in foot
traffic in the 1990s. But record numbers of people have also paid a
virtual visit to Everest, the world's highest mountain, in the last
few years.
</P>
<P>
   Some 20 expeditions (and at least 150 climbers) are trying
Everest this year, and more than a dozen have their own Web sites,
with journal-style dispatches, photos, route maps, audio and video
clips, and thumbnail Everest histories. Far from being a remote
adventure, high-altitude mountaineering is now a spectator sport.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always this way, of course. Sir Edmund Hillary, of New
Zealand, and Tenzing Norgay, a Sherpa guide, were the first
climbers to reach Everest's summit, on May 29, 1953. The news of
the feat, by a British expedition, reached the public on June 2
(the day of Queen Elizabeth's inauguration, by happy coincidence) _
and the news moved that fast only because The London Times had sent
a correspondent, James Morris, to Nepal.
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed: James Morris now writes as Jan Morris, and
when Everest is climbed today, the public knows about it before the
climbers are off the mountain. Climbers radio from the top down to
base camp, where team members call home on satellite phones. Then
expedition Web sites quickly post updates that read like breaking
news, even if there is a little lag time.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the Web, desktop mountaineers now get a taste of the
unfolding anxiety and uncertainty faced by real mountaineers. Take
Carolyn Hahn, a writer living in New York, who, along with other
family members, uses the Web to follow the feats of her brother
Dave, a professional climber who has reached the Everest summit and
sent witty Web dispatches back from the mountain in each of the
last two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only know what's on the Web,'' she said. ``When two climbers
died on his route last year, we got an e-mail saying he was OK But
otherwise, I just read the same updates as everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web would be well suited to accounts of climbing feats even
without this immediacy. Good sites include abundant photographs
(most can be enlarged with a click) and other visual effects,
combining them with text in creative ways to give readers more of
that elusive you-are-there feeling than can be had while curled up
in an armchair with a book or magazine. With so many sites, though,
it may not be clear where to begin. Here are a few ways to make the
mountains come to you. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (italics)``Into Thin Air,'' a book by Jon Krakauer about the
1996 climbing disaster on Mount Everest, spent a long time atop the
best-seller list, and the Imax film ``Everest'' enjoyed a long run
in theaters. If you want to find out more about the disaster, in
which five people died, here are a few Web sites related to it and
to other climbs in 1996:(end italics) &QL;

best single-expedition Web site I've ever seen, in the
Mountaineering section under the heading Togliatti K2 1996. It is
the story of a Russian team that climbed K2 (the world's
second-highest mountain) in the summer of 1996, told from the
perspectives of two climbers. Lavishly illustrated with stunning
photos and video. &QL;

<P>
   THE MOUNTAIN ZONE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   www.mountainzone.com &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A commercial site with plenty of high-end gadgetry at its
disposal, the Mountain Zone, based in Seattle, has done more than
any other site to move climbing into the virtual world. For
climbing fans, a significant part of the site's attraction is that
it follows the stars of American mountaineering, who are paid to
send in reports as correspondents.
</P>
<P>
   The Mountain Zone is currently providing updates from three
Himalayan expeditions. One team is attempting the unprecedented
triple play of climbing the south side of Everest, then its two
adjoining neighbors, Lhotse (the world's fourth-highest peak) and
Nuptse.
</P>
<P>
   Another group is on the north side of Everest, searching for
evidence of the expedition of George Mallory and Andrew Irvine,
Everest pioneers who did not return from their 1924 climb. On
Sunday, these climbers announced that they had found Mallory's body
and would continue to search for more evidence.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, Ed Viesturs, who is America's best-known climber
and is prominently featured in ``Everest,'' an Imax film, is
closing in on a highly coveted mountaineering prize: scaling all 14
of the world's peaks measuring 8,000 meters (more than 26,000 feet)
or more. With his climb of Dhaulagiri on Tuesday, Viesturs' tally
is at 12.
</P>
<P>
   The dispatches sent back to Seattle by climbers on all three
teams make up the heart of the coverage. These are either progress
reports or, on rest days, a chance for climbers to reflect on their
calling. Pete Athans, the south-side team leader, recently invoked
T.S. Eliot's poetry to describe his awe of Everest _ ``the object
of all our exploring is to arrive at the beginning and know the
place for the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Many dispatches are transcripts of satellite phone or radio
calls from base camp and above. I listen to these using the Windows
Media Player, although Real Playeralso works. Most have been casual
briefings from lower elevations on Everest, but when Viesturs
climbed Dhaulagiri Tuesday, he radioed down an hour later, in a
voice strained with fatigue. The recent dispatches about Mallory's
body are also available as audio clips.
</P>
<P>
   The most spectacular parts of the Mountain Zone's Everest
coverage are its video clips and 360-degree photos. The former
(which require Real Player) include an airplane fly-by of Everest.
Even better are the photos posted by the south-siders. The images
automatically pan like video clips when loaded, but they can be
controlled by mouse, and it is possible to zoom in (although much
sharpness is lost).
</P>
<P>
   The 360-degree photo from Camp 1, with Everest, Lhotse and
Nuptse looming overhead, is by itself worth a trip to the site. My
favorite shows the Thyangboche monastery on the trek in: animals
graze serenely with Everest visible in the distance. To find the
images, go to the south-side dispatches, then click on the Features
and Multimedia links.
</P>
<P>
   The Mountain Zone is, however, unabashedly commercial.
Advertisements line the site, and an Everest Store sells all manner
of memorabilia. So far I have resisted buying replica Sherpa prayer
flags for $29.95; my visits feel authentic enough already. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EVEREST NEWS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   www.everestnews.com  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With a homespun feel and few visual offerings, Everest News is
the antithesis of the Mountain Zone. Nonetheless, it has also
become a virtual base camp for desktop mountaineers. The site
provides two attractive services: news updates from Everest and
other major peaks, posted a few times a day during the spring and
summer, and links to the Web sites of nearly every major
expedition.
</P>
<P>
   Using an impressive network of climbers, Sherpas and base camp
managers as sources, the site aims for comprehensive coverage of
developments on Everest, including summit attempts, controversies
and, inevitably, deaths.
</P>
<P>
   It is unique among mountaineering sites in making an effort to
keep track of the Sherpas, who are among the strongest climbers
around. And in contrast with the Mountain Zone, the site emphasizes
climbers from outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   News items are gathered from contributors around the globe _
most of whom communicate with one another only through e-mail _ and
translated into English when necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Partly for this reason, Everest News is in need of a more
consistent editorial tone, and the navigation is unwieldy. Getting
access to the site's other features _ a news archive, climber
interviews, book listings _ can be tedious. Still, if looking at
the Mountain Zone is akin to watching sports highlights on
television, reading Everest News is like a leisurely stroll through
the baseball box scores: it's a more complete way to keep track of
the game and sometimes more satisfying, as well. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NOVA ONLINE: LOST ON EVEREST _ THE SEARCH FOR MALLORY AND
IRVINE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/everest &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay stood on top of
Mount Everest, the summit was reached by two other climbers: George
Mallory and Andrew Irvine. That, at least, is what some
mountaineering romantics claim. Mallory _ he's the one who said he
wanted to climb Everest ``because it is there'' _ and his partner
were last seen 1,000 feet from the top while making their 1924
summit bid.
</P>
<P>
   Until now. Seventy-five years later, an American team _ the same
north-side team sending reports to the Mountain Zone _ is trying to
figure out what became of the climbers, and they are filming a
``Nova'' documentary in the process. On Sunday, they reported the
discovery of Mallory's body, and they are promising further
evidence of whether or not he reached the summit.
</P>
<P>
   Even without the news of this discovery, the accompanying PBS
Web site is an excellent introduction to Everest. The team plans to
send a Quick Time movie back from each camp on the route. For those
unfamiliar with the topography of Everest, the Climb section
provides a good virtual tour of the mountain from both sides.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   What most distinguishes the site is the historical background it
provides. The Lost on Everest section has profiles of Mallory and
Irvine, complete with pictures of their equipment, which now looks
astonishingly antiquated and makes their efforts seem even more
impressive, whatever the result. Tweed coats (in which Mallory
first climbed Everest) are nice but not, it must be said, ideal
gear for high-altitude climbing.
</P>
<P>
   This is the third ``Nova'' show to be filmed on Everest in the
last four years, and the current site has integrated considerable
material that was first posted in 1996 and 1997. There are sections
on Sherpa culture, high-altitude physiology and even geology (the
summit of Everest consists of marine limestone).
</P>
<P>
   Lost on Everest contains so much information that I began to
feel lost among all the choices after a while. The site map is
probably the best way to navigate this mountain of information
without forgetting what it was you intended to look at in the first
place. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EVEREST INTERNET EXPERIMENT 1999 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   www.mounteverest.net &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of all the expeditions managing their own Web sites, the most
technologically ambitious is an international team of climbers
conducting what they are calling the Everest Internet Experiment.
This is nothing less than an effort to perform the first-ever live
Webcast from the summit of the mountain, in the form of a video
feed that will be refreshed every five seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to master Everest with technology are frequently
thwarted, but a live video feed was first broadcast from the
summit, the roof of the world, in 1983. The members of this
expedition have been busy setting up relay antennas on the lower
slopes of the mountain in preparation for the big day.
</P>
<P>
   They also hope to provide audio during the Webcast. They say
they have backup plans for the quick release of digital summit
photos if the live feed does not work.
</P>
<P>
   The live Webcast is only one of two stunts this team is hoping
to pull off. A Sherpa climber, Babu Shirri, will try to sleep at
the summit for a night. (Few people have survived a night anywhere
near the top.) The two events are planned for the same night.
</P>
<P>
   The site also has daily dispatches (which are gradually becoming
more anxious in tone) and usually a few new photos every day, as
well as the standard climber biographies. A section on mountain
medicine is somewhat melodramatic about the perils of altitude,
warning, ``You might fall asleep with a slight headache only to
never wake again in the morning.'' Let us hope that description
won't apply to Shirri if he dozes at the summit. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BBC ONLINE: EVEREST ONLINE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   www.bbc.co.uk/england/everest  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are mountaineering stars who keep returning to Mount
Everest on well-financed expeditions, and then there are
lesser-known climbers who just can't get the mountain out of their
systems. The second category includes Graham Ratcliffe, who is
climbing Everest for the fifth time and sending dispatches about it
back to England via the BBC's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual for amateur climbers to return to Everest
several times in an attempt to reach the summit just once, but
Ratcliffe has already successfully visited the summit, in 1995. He
is, however, one of three people trying to become _ get ready for
it _ the first Englishman to reach the summit of Everest from both
the north and south sides. If this distinction seems esoteric,
well, it is.
</P>
<P>
   Ratcliffe comes across as affable in his intermittent updates.
The BBC's site is likewise modest, offering dispatches with some
audio and video, an account of Ratcliffe's previous climbs and the
inevitable briefly sketched climbing history of Everest.
</P>
<P>
   According to the latest update, relations among the dueling
Brits contesting for this honor ``are becoming a little tense at
base camp.'' Ratcliffe allows that ``it is competitive'' there. To
some extent, blame the Web for this. In modern mountaineering, the
stakes are higher than ever for relatively unknown climbers like
Ratcliffe, in a sense, because virtual spectators the world over
can tell how he is doing.
</P>
<P>
   It is a new rite of spring: learning a little about each year's
crop of Everest climbers, cheering on old favorites and either
pulling for or rooting against the lesser-known players in the
drama. I hope Ratcliffe reaches the summit, of course, but why do I
keep checking his site? There can be only one good reason: because
it is there.

   Q: Where does this e-mail message live from the time I hit the
`send' key to the time you read it?
</P>
<P>
   A: An e-mail message is passed along by many different computers
until it reaches its destination, just as postal mail is handled by
letter carriers and a network of post offices until it is delivered
to your mailbox. In many systems, once you hit the `send' button,
your e-mail message goes to what is called a SMTP (simple mail
transfer protocol) server. This server checks the address on the
message and forwards it to the mail server of your intended
recipient.
</P>
<P>
   A mail server is a computer that contains electronic mailboxes
for each of its users. If you have an account with Earthlink, for
example, you have an electronic mailbox on Earthlink's mail server.
Until you log onto your Internet service provider to retrieve your
messages, the mail waits for you in your electronic mailbox.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail is fast and convenient, but not as private as you might
think. Because a message goes through several different computers
on its journey, it is possible for other people to intercept it.
And because mail is kept on servers that are often backed up and
archived (especially in corporations), you cannot assume that a
message is gone forever just because you delete it from your
computer So be sure to think before you send.

BREAKING THE ISOLATION BARRIER IN CELEBRATION, FLA. 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (js) 
Douglas Frantz, a national correspondent for The New York Times,
and Catherine Collins, a writer, are the authors of ``Celebration,
U.S.A.,'' to be published in September by Henry Holt &AMP; Co. 
 By DOUGLAS FRANTZ and CATHERINE COLLINS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CELEBRATION, Fla. _ Less than a week after we moved to this new
town being built by Walt Disney Co., a neighbor dropped by to chat,
and the topic turned to children. One of the great things about
living here, he said, is that the kids will have so many adults
watching over them.
</P>
<P>
   We were somewhat taken aback, thinking that perhaps Celebration
would be just a little too neighborly for us, but as we conclude
our second year here, we have come to see a measure of wisdom in
that neighbor's point of view.
</P>
<P>
   On an important level, the New Urbanist elements of Celebration
contribute to a sense of community that creates a cocoon of sorts
around the children. It doesn't replace parents, and it isn't a
grant of immunity from crime or problems. But the housing density,
sidewalks and knowing your neighbors translate into a high degree
of freedom for our children and a level of comfort as parents that
are both new to us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I don't have any teen-agers, I know a lot of
them,'' said Kathy Johnson, the executive director of the
Celebration Foundation, which administers community programs and
coordinates volunteer efforts in town. ``I know them well enough
that if I saw them doing something wonderful I would praise them,
and if I saw them doing something wrong I would tell their parents.
There is a kind of shared parenting here in Celebration.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no new development in the United States has undergone
the publicity and scrutiny of Celebration, located some 20 miles
southwest of Orlando. Since the initial residents moved in nearly
three years ago, the town has grown to more than 2,000, and
ultimately Celebration is to have 8,000 homes and 20,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   Part of what drew people like us to Celebration was the search
for an alternative to the isolation of modern suburbs, like
Westport, Conn., the last place we lived before moving here. If
residents weren't exactly looking for a return to small-town
America, they were trying to find that lost sense of
neighborliness.
</P>
<P>
   The old-fashioned notion of looking out for each other,
especially the children, has been a natural outgrowth of design
elements like front porches, tree-shaded sidewalks and placing the
school and the business district smack in the middle of town.
</P>
<P>
   Adapting to amenities aimed at pleasing the adults who pay the
mortgages, children congregate in the parks, collect on the benches
outside the stores and race through town on Rollerblades or
bicycles, all under the watchful eye of adults.
</P>
<P>
   Our school-age children _ Nick, 13, and Becky, 11 _ know that if
they get into trouble, we'll hear about it. If an older teen-ager
is driving too fast, you can bet the phone will be ringing at his
or her home before he or she is in the door.
</P>
<P>
   But there are benefits for teen-agers, too. ``A lot of kids get
on the wrong track because their parents work and there's no one to
turn to,'' said Tracey Pellegrine, a 16-year-old junior who is the
president of the student government at Celebration School. ``Here
we have plenty of support from other adults. I know our neighbors.
I can call them, even to ask simple things, like, `How do I do a
bleach load in the laundry?'''
</P>
<P>
   She said that her younger sister, Wendy, and her friends enjoy
enormous freedom because they are mobile. On any given afternoon,
the community pool at Lakeside Park is thronged with children of
all ages, while their comrades zip along the sidewalks on
Rollerblades or gather in impromptu groups on the bridge between
the park and downtown. On most Friday nights, 20 or 30 kids attend
the local movie together.
</P>
<P>
   ``The design of this town helps to fight the isolation that so
many children face today,'' said Darcie Rudsinski, a teacher at the
school. ``It allows them to interact, to build relationships,
rather than sit home in front of a television. It lets kids be
kids, the way they used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   But life is not perfect for teen-agers in Celebration. The
biggest complaint among them is the lack of a place of their own.
Just as adults meet at Barnie's for coffee in the mornings or at
Max's Grille for a beer in the evenings, teen-agers would like
another athletic field or a playground at the school, or a skating
or youth center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The planners left out a youth center or a boys' and girls'
club, like most successful urban centers have,'' said Joseph Judge,
who owns a bicycle shop in town.
</P>
<P>
   Peter S. Rummell, the former president of Disney's development
arm and the originator of the Celebration idea, said that the
town's planners rejected building a youth center in favor of
gathering spots like Lakeside Park. ``The only thing teen-agers
really want is to be with other teen-agers,'' said Rummell, now the
chairman and chief executive of St. Joe Co., a development business
based in Jacksonville, Fla. ``You need to provide places for them
to do that, and you need to encourage civil tolerance.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes civil tolerance is tough to come by for kids. Not long
ago our son, Nick, was filming a Rollerblading video as a school
project in front of a business downtown. As his friends launched
themselves toward the camera, spinning in midair, a storeowner came
out to complain and ordered the children off the sidewalk and onto
the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a place to blade,'' Nick complained after the
incident. In much the same vein, teen-agers and adults alike
complain about the lack of walking and biking trails promised in
the original promotional literature. A recent brochure for the town
used a photograph of a family biking along a scenic trail _ only
the trail was a cart path on the golf course, which is off limits
to bikers, bladers and walkers alike.
</P>
<P>
   Some merchants, however, could not be more accommodating when it
comes to children. Every day after school, an endless stream of
teen-agers strolls or rolls through the door of Village Mercantile,
a clothing store downtown. Some stop by to say hello. Others use
the phone to check in with parents at home or at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the second or third day we were open, a kid came in asking
for change to call home,'' said Dottie Mathison, who owns the store
with her husband, Jerry. ``I'm a mother, and I thought it was great
that this kid needed to call home, so I said, `Don't waste your
money. Use my phone.' And it's gone from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Other times, children come in seeking advice. One girl stopped
by recently and said she had just had a minor traffic accident.
When she asked what she should do, Mrs. Mathison recalled, ``I said
to go home and tell her parents.''
</P>
<P>
   As parents, we take comfort in the close-knit nature of the town
and have allowed Nick and Becky more freedom than they have had
elsewhere. They have rules about checking in, and they get regular
lectures about realities like crime and drugs. But Nick and Becky
and all of their friends, older and younger, say that they have
more freedom in Celebration than anyplace they have ever lived _
even if the town wasn't specifically designed for them.

 &HT;    INTERNET TO OFFER ONLINE TOOL TO HELP PROTECT KIDS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (a) general news categories
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- In the wake of the Columbine High School killings,
15 of the nation's top Internet firms came together Wednesday to
offer parents a set of easy-to-use tools aimed at protecting their
children from online violence, smut and hate.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the initiative at a bipartisan White House
briefing, Vice President Al Gore said: ``When it comes to the
Internet, too many parents feel now they are faced with a false
choice between unplugging the computer in the family room or
spending every moment of their lives looking over their child's
shoulder to make sure they are not wandering into some dangerous
online alleyway.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry initiative, Gore said, provides ``a third choice
(and) a better way'' -- in the form of a resource guide, dubbed the
``parents protection page.'' When the project is fully implemented
_ by July _ one mouse click from Web sites that account for 95 per
cent of all Internet traffic will take users to the
all-encompassing child-proofing guide.
</P>
<P>
   The service will give parents rapid access to as many as 80
features intended to give parents more control over their home
computers. From the new protection Web site, parents will be able
to:
</P>
<P>
   - Deploy the latest blocking and filtering programs that can
limit access to violent game sites, hate groups and other materials
that adults deem are bad for children.
</P>
<P>
   - Monitor which Web sites and chat rooms their children have
visited.
</P>
<P>
   - Set time limits on their children's online sessions.
</P>
<P>
   - Get information on how to report criminal activity, with links
to such sites as the National Center for Missing and Exploited
Children tip line.
</P>
<P>
   - Utilize pointers to ``kid-friendly'' sites that offer good
educational content.
</P>
<P>
   Since Gore is the leading Democratic presidential candidate,
some industry leaders feared they would be used in a political
response to the national outcry over last month's slayings in
Littleton, Colo. The killers maintained an Internet hate site that
hinted at the massacre-to-come.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really had to scramble to find some Republicans to join
in,'' said Kathryn Montgomery, president of the Center for Media
Education. ``Some Internet folks refused to come because they
thought it smacked too much of a political event.''
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim follows)
</P>
<P>
   Gore's problem was solved, however, when Sen. Ben Nighthorse
Campbell, R-Colo., agreed to join him in the Roosevelt Room, along
with Sen. Leahy, D-Vt. Speaking first, Campbell said, ``Now is not
the time to point fingers.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore ranks among the nation's most computer savvy politician and
clearly hopes to parley that extensive knowledge in the 2000
presidential campaign. But he has also stumbled, earning widespread
scorn by claiming in March that he had ``created'' the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   (end optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   While the direct cause of the killing spree by two Colorado
teenagers remains unknown, polls show that many Americans blame the
tragedy on the supposedly dangerous influence of the Internet --
along with access to firearms, violent TV shows and video games and
poor parenting.
</P>
<P>
   Although there has been talk on Capitol Hill and elsewhere over
the years about the need to improve online protection for young
people, industry leaders clearly felt the need to move quickly to
ease parental concerns in the aftermath of the Colorado shootings.
</P>
<P>
   The 15 firms joining in the voluntary child-protection program
are America Online, AT&AMP;T, (at)Home, Bell Atlantic, Commercial
Internet Exchange, Disney, Excite, Lycos, MCI, Microsoft,
MindSpring Enterprises, Netscape, Network Solutions, Prodigy and
Yahoo!

`GROUND' ROCKS FOR RUSHDIE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By FRITZ LANHAM 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Broadly speaking, it's nice to be able to change
the subject back to books,'' Salman Rushdie says softly.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly ``The Ground Beneath Her Feet,'' his new epic about
love, rock 'n' roll, exile, the perils of celebrity and a laundry
list of other themes.
</P>
<P>
   The 51-year-old India-born novelist has come to Los Angeles for
BookExpo, the annual convention of independent booksellers and
trade publishers, to pump his seventh work of fiction.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, the ``other'' subject _ the death threat he has
lived under since 1989, when Ayatollah Khomeini deemed ``The
Satanic Verses'' blasphemous to Islam _ remains a shadow on the
wall. Witness the precautions you don't normally associate with an
author interview.
</P>
<P>
   A sit-down session with Rushdie begins in the booth of his
publisher, Henry Holt, on the floor of the convention.
</P>
<P>
   You are frog-marched out of the building _ there's a schedule to
keep _ and into a waiting dark-colored Ford Ranger parked
unobtrusively at the curb, its engine idling.
</P>
<P>
   Through the streets of downtown Los Angeles you go, finally
stopping at the unmarked side door of a hotel. Your escort punches
in the code that unlocks the door. Up you pass through a stairwell
that opens onto a hallway, where you're greeted by Rushdie's
smiling publicist and two men in dark suits who look at you but do
not smile at all.
</P>
<P>
   Then you're ushered into a sitting room, where Rushdie, dressed
in a soft, brown suit, rises from a couch to greet you.
</P>
<P>
   Before embarking on these press interviews, Rushdie gave an
invitation-only reading at the convention Thursday. (While in L.A.,
he also reportedly taped a segment of ``Politically Incorrect'' and
made a surprise appearance at the Los Angeles Public Library to
read from his new book.)
</P>
<P>
   And in mid-April, he gave an advertised-in-advance public
reading at Cooper Union in New York _ security officers checked
attendees with a hand-held metal detector. He's done similar
readings in London, Amsterdam and Rome.
</P>
<P>
   All this rush of Rushdie simply indicates he has ``resumed
normal service,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long time of abnormal service. And as you can
see,'' _ he nods toward the unsmiling men in the next room _
``there's still one or two abnormalities.''
</P>
<P>
   But since the Iranian government announced last year that it no
longer supported carrying out Khomeini's ``fatwa,'' the threat has
diminished, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What remains is that, as we all know, Iran is a fragmented
leadership and there are groups that don't agree with what the
government says, so there's still some residual risk of that sort.
But those people's ability to act is obviously much less than
state-sponsored terrorism, which is what we were facing for the
previous 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``So my view is, `the hell with it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Polite, with a hint of British chill, articulate, soft-spoken,
Rushdie answers the obligatory questions about death threats but is
clearly happier when the subject turns to his book, which has been
getting mixed reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ground Beneath Her Feet'' is an exuberant, inventive tale
that spans three continents and is told in pun-packed prose with
allusions that range from Eastern religion to Western rock 'n'
roll. The protagonists (and lovers) are a pair of Indian rockers
who become world celebrities _ think of a parallel universe in
which Madonna and Mick Jagger were born in Bombay.
</P>
<P>
   Rushdie's love of rock 'n' roll is neither an affectation nor a
new passion. He grew up listening to it in India. Bill Haley rocked
not only around the clock but around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speed with which (rock) got 'round the world is really
quite startling because it did it at a time when the world had not
been globalized,'' Rushdie said, adding that rock arrived in India
before television.
</P>
<P>
   Western rock didn't seem alien to him and his peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a kind of universal language of youth. ... It probably
got everybody's feet tapping in much the same way, all around the
world at the same time. It was kind of rebellious and oppositional
and contraband music in exactly the same way as here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among his early favorites: Haley, Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis and
``Ricky Nelson, God help me.'' These days Rushdie numbers among his
friends Lou Reed and U2 lead singer Bono. The Irish band has
written and recorded a song employing lyrics Rushdie penned for the
book. (Look for ``The Ground Beneath Her Feet,'' the tune, on U2's
next album, due in September.)
</P>
<P>
   Rushdie has always been a novelist with a grand reach, so people
may be surprised that something as low culture as rock 'n' roll
figures so largely in the book. They shouldn't be, Rushdie said. A
writer should respond to the whole culture of his time, not the
highbrow bits.
</P>
<P>
   The action of the novel begins in India and moves to England and
then America, mirroring the rise of American popular culture to
world dominance in the postwar period. What better vehicle than
rock to illustrate that trajectory?
</P>
<P>
   ``All my writing has been very interested in popular culture,''
Rushdie said.
</P>
<P>
   The inescapability of celebrity is a major theme in the book.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly ``The Ground Beneath Her Feet'' is about love, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an age which is, on the one hand, disgustingly sentimental
and, on the other hand, disgustingly cynical, I wanted to write
seriously about love in a way that was neither of those things,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how living under the ``fatwa'' has changed him as a
writer, he said it taught him ``both the very dark lessons about
hatred and bigotry and intolerance'' and the ``much more important
lessons about love ... from all sorts of people, not just my wife
and family.''
</P>
<P>
   Rushdie's second marriage failed not long after the ``fatwa,''
and in 1997 he married editor Elizabeth West. The couple have a
2-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I think back on it, that's what sticks in my memory _ not
the hostility but the affection and solidarity and concern. All
that wrapped together you call love. That's why the business of
writing about love has moved closer and closer to the center of my
work.''

DRAWING INSPIRATION: NEW SHOW DEPICTS DEGAS' FAMILY LIFE IN NEW
ORLEANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JANET TYSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ When Edgar Degas stepped from the train into New
Orleans in late 1872, he was greeted not only by members of his
mother's family, the Mussons, but also by a bewildering welter of
dazzling light, intense heat and humidity, a hubbub of bodies _ as
many black as there were white _ and lush vegetation. For the
Parisian, cosmopolitan though he was, it was an unnervingly exotic
scene.
</P>
<P>
   And one he never painted.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the story of Degas in New Orleans did make for pictures _
works far ahead of their time in psychological content and formal
composition _ that in turn have made for a remarkable new
exhibition at the New Orleans Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   ``Degas and New Orleans: A French Impressionist in America''
features 40 works by Degas, including 17 that he painted in the
Crescent City, as well as related family letters, furniture,
jewelry, photographs and other historic materials. Assembled under
the leadership of curator Gail Fiegenbaum, the exhibit is the
centerpiece of a statewide celebration of French history and
culture called FrancoFete.
</P>
<P>
   Degas, whose mother was born in New Orleans, was the only French
impressionist to sojourn to the New World. When he arrived on the
banks of the Mississippi, Degas was a mature and thoughtful 38, but
still in the formative stages of his career. His familiar paintings
and pastels of ballet dancers and washerwomen still were ahead of
him, although numerous family portraits had established Degas as an
artist who loved to focus on a narrow range of subjects, then
reinterpret them endlessly.
</P>
<P>
   Family was the overt reason for Degas' visit _ his fondness for
his relations was sincere and profound _ but he also needed to
clarify his sense of himself as an artist. He left New Orleans
about five months later, clearly focused on what he needed to do,
one reason for this exhibition's importance.
</P>
<P>
   But, as in the case of any show worth its salt, the real merit
of ``Degas and New Orleans'' lies in the penetrating pictures it
assembles, images that gain impact by being shown together.
</P>
<P>
   Small enough that each work can be savored in depth, this is an
essential exhibition for anyone interested in Degas. But it also
would be invaluable viewing to anyone who cares about modern
painting: It's no exaggeration to say that some of its pictures
look ahead not only to impressionism, but to the post-impressionism
of Cezanne, to the cubist-inspired works of Matisse and even _ in
one tiny, chilling portrait of Degas' cousin, Estelle _ the work of
the late-20th century German painter Gerhard Richter, many of whose
images are taken from the mass media.
</P>
<P>
   History buffs will enjoy the sprawling family tree the NOMA has
delineated, which seems to connect Degas with almost every other
Creole family in New Orleans. The only fault is a life-size
re-creation of the Musson family's porch, installed perhaps in the
fear that art alone would not seize visitors' imagination.
</P>
<P>
   A number of other organizations are highlighting Degas
connections around the city. Several houses and commercial
buildings were either built by or inhabited by Musson family
members.
</P>
<P>
   The most relevant, the cotton-factoring office represented in
Degas' New Orleans masterpiece, has been given over to a business.
The other important site, the Musson family house where Degas
painted several pictures of his female relations, has been
restored, but rather clumsily.
</P>
<P>
   Only here and there _ on the balcony of the Musson house on
Esplanade, for example _ is the scene sufficiently quiet and
pleasantly haunted to imagine the artist socializing or at work.
</P>
<P>
   The good news, though, is that this partial failure to place
Degas' work into the context of the city is entirely appropriate to
the nature of what Degas was doing during his visit.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Degas was not a painter of the appearance of
places and things. He may have been fascinated with what he saw in
tumultuous, Reconstruction-era New Orleans _ certainly the residue
of colonial gentility and the mixing of races and cultures
intrigued him _ but he considered himself another sort of artist.
</P>
<P>
   So, instead of setting up on the levee and painting men loading
barges, Degas stayed indoors and painted mesmerizing portraits of
his cousins and their children. Thus we see Mathilde Musson Bell,
garbed as a nurse, seated within the confining frame of a doorway.
Or an exquisite portrait of Estelle Musson Balfour De Gas (Degas'
father's spelling of the family name), her left eye bandaged,
enduring her progressive blindness with great courage.
</P>
<P>
   Degas' choice of subject was also influenced by trouble he was
having with his own eyesight _ and he was terrified that the city's
tropical light would blind him. Finally, the hot, humid air
stripped Degas of energy for most of his visit: Only toward the end
did he get out much _ when he painted ``A Cotton Office in New
Orleans,'' a portrait of his male relations as their business was
going bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   On loan from the municipal museum in Pau, France, ``A Cotton
Office'' was the first impressionist painting to be purchased by a
museum. Included in it are portraits of Degas' uncle, Michel Musson
(seated in the foreground, inspecting a swatch of cotton); his
brother Achille (the dandy leaning on the counter at the left); and
his other brother Rene (reading a newspaper).
</P>
<P>
   Arguably, here Degas did seek to convey information about the
particulars of time and place. But, even though he carefully
reconstructs the room and the roles of its denizens, he nonetheless
presents a tension-filled study of individuals in the midst of
ruin.
</P>
<P>
   Ruin, turmoil, suppressed suffering. All makings of the soap
opera that seems to have characterized Degas-Musson family life and
_ as local historians love to point out _ the history of New
Orleans, a haunted city that was briefly home to one of Europe's
greatest artists.

CARMICHAEL TAKES JAZZ ACCLAIM IN STRIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Historically, most stride piano players are African-American men
_ and dead.
</P>
<P>
   Stride is a demanding, highly rhythmic, jaunty style of solo
piano that flourished in Harlem during the '20s and '30s. It was
party music, a precursor of big-band swing, and for a time (via
Fats Waller, James P. Johnson and Willie ``The Lion'' Smith) wildly
popular, the sophisticated, big-city equivalent of solo acoustic
guitar Mississippi Delta blues.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty years later, stride is all but jazz history, left to a
handful of serious players and a small but devoted coterie of fans.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Judy Carmichael, a funny, talkative, blond
Californian who never even heard stride until she was 22 but has
since learned to play it on a par with her musical heroes _ so
well, in fact, that Count Basie nicknamed her ``Stride.''
</P>
<P>
   In background and appearance, Carmichael is as far away from
those Harlem masters as can be. But for years, she has been
receiving raves as one of stride's foremost modern practitioners;
she has recorded seven CDs and in 1992 was the first jazz musician
sponsored by the U.S. government to tour China.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met some people who told me later that they walked into a
club where I was playing, saw me and walked out _ they couldn't
believe someone who looked like me could play,'' Carmichael says.
``People used to think I was nuts; they couldn't believe I wanted
to do this for a living.''
</P>
<P>
   Carmichael discovered stride via a recording of Basie playing
with Bennie Moten in the '20s, and for a while she alternated
ragtime and jazz. Six months later, she got a job playing at
Disneyland, where she met Basie, his guitarist, Freddie Green, and
jazz vocalist Sarah Vaughan.
</P>
<P>
   She stayed at Disneyland for five years and then moved to New
York and released her first, Grammy-nominated record, ``Two-Handed
Stride,'' which was later released on CD as ``And Basie Called Her
`Stride.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, she has toured the world and has continued to study
the history of jazz piano. Several years ago, she received a grant
from the National Endowment for the Arts, which she used to design
a program detailing the history of jazz piano. She has taken the
program to colleges nationwide and has written two books on jazz.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to educate people; when I started, only older
people knew what stride was,'' she says. ``But I mainly play stride
because I love it. It's just a great way to play piano.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to touring, Carmichael has recently been gathering
interviews for her upcoming ``Jazz Inspired'' series, which will
begin airing on National Public Radio in March 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you what this means to me,'' she says. ``It's
about fascinating, creative people who connect to jazz because of
the wonderful music it is. If people hear that Robert Redford says
jazz changed his life, maybe they'll give it a second chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks partly to last year's swing revival, Carmichael says, she
has noticed her audiences skewing younger these days. The trend,
she says, suits her just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``For people under 40, I'm their image of what a stride player
is,'' she says. ``They don't know about Fats Waller. They just like
the music. They think it sounds like the Gap commercial, with the
people dancing to swing music. These people know about stride
because of me. That's exciting.''

 &HT;    FCC CHAIRMAN WANTS MORE INTERNET FUNDS FOR SCHOOLS, LIBRARIES
 &HT;    400&AMP;adds.
 &HT;    Eds: Note state inserts following 5th graf.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Discounts to schools and libraries for
telecommunications and Internet connections would double next year
under a plan unveiled Wednesday by Chairman Bill Kennard of the
Federal Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we follow this course, we will be able to wire (another)
528,000 public school classrooms to the Internet,'' Kennard said.
``We will be able to connect one-third of public schools throughout
rural America.''
</P>
<P>
   That would allow the nation to reach the goal set by Vice
President Al Gore of connecting virtually every public and private
classroom to the Internet by the year 2000, said Education
Secretary Richard Riley.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard said he wants the FCC to authorize the legal maximum of
$2.25 billion in discounts for schools and libraries during the
year that begins July 1.
</P>
<P>
   In the program's first 18 months, which will end in June, more
than 25,000 schools, libraries, districts and system received $1.66
billion in discounts _ equal to about $1.1 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   The money comes from the e-rate, the ``universal access'' fee
that the FCC requires be paid by phone companies, most of which
pass it along to their customers under a system that costs the
average residential customer just under $1 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard apparently has the votes on the FCC to pass his plan
under existing law. But there is a slight chance that Congress
could block that by approving bills by some Republicans in Congress
who want to reduce or eliminate the fee.
</P>
<P>
   (Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Tancredo, R-Colo., and 14 Republican cosponsors have
introduced the ``E-Rate Termination Act.'' Tancredo has denounced
the e-rate as ``an unfunded mandate on the private sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ron Klink, D-Pa., and five cosponsors from both parties
have proposed ending the program after five years, and Reps. Billy
Tauzin, R-La., and Conrad Burns, R-Mont., want to cap annual
spending at $1.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Klink and Tauzin bills would also collect the money through
an excise tax, rather than a fee. That worries religious school
leaders, because giving tax money to church-sponsored activities is
so controversial that such a change might hurt their chances of
getting a share of the pie.
</P>
<P>
   (End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Some consumer groups are also skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Chairman Kennard can fund it without increasing my phone
bill, we won't squawk, but I'm suspicious,'' said Mark Cooper,
director of research for the Consumer Federation of America. ``If
he wants to fund this program, he should cut the fat somewhere
else, like lowering the subscriber line charge.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennard said he believed that fee changes under consideration by
the FCC could offset the extra cost of his increase and leave
long-distance companies with $500 million that they could either
keep or use to lower their charges to customers.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of teachers, librarians, Catholic bishops,
farmers, school psychologists, education officials and two other
members of Clinton's cabinet joined in praising Kennard's plan.
</P>
<P>
   It will be adopted, and all efforts to slash it will fail,
supporters predicted when Kennard announced his position at a
meeting in the Washington headquarters of the National Education
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The more than 32,000 applicants seeking $2.45 billion in the
year ahead should make their plans on the assumption that at least
$2.25 billion will be approved, said Lynne Bradley, deputy
executive director of the American Library Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have 80,000 schools and libraries where the parents, the
teachers, the administrators, the library and school board members
would arise if these discounts didn't continue,'' she said.

 &HT;    INTERNET TO OFFER ONLINE TOOL TO HELP PROTECT KIDS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (a) general news categories
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- In the wake of the Columbine High School killings,
15 of the nation's top Internet firms came together Wednesday to
offer parents a set of easy-to-use tools aimed at protecting their
children from online violence, smut and hate.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the initiative at a bipartisan White House
briefing, Vice President Al Gore said: ``When it comes to the
Internet, too many parents feel now they are faced with a false
choice between unplugging the computer in the family room or
spending every moment of their lives looking over their child's
shoulder to make sure they are not wandering into some dangerous
online alleyway.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry initiative, Gore said, provides ``a third choice
(and) a better way'' -- in the form of a resource guide, dubbed the
``parents protection page.'' When the project is fully implemented
_ by July _ one mouse click from Web sites that account for 95 per
cent of all Internet traffic will take users to the
all-encompassing child-proofing guide.
</P>
<P>
   The service will give parents rapid access to as many as 80
features intended to provide them with more control over their home
computers. From the new protection Web site, parents will be able
to:
</P>
<P>
   - Deploy the latest blocking and filtering programs that can
limit access to violent game sites, hate groups and other materials
that adults deem are bad for children.
</P>
<P>
   - Monitor which Web sites and chat rooms their children have
visited.
</P>
<P>
   - Set time limits on their children's online sessions.
</P>
<P>
   - Get information on how to report criminal activity, with links
to such sites as the National Center for Missing and Exploited
Children tip line.
</P>
<P>
   - Utilize pointers to ``kid-friendly'' sites that offer good
educational content.
</P>
<P>
   Since Gore is the leading Democratic presidential candidate,
some industry leaders feared they would be used in a political
response to the national outcry over last month's slayings in
Littleton, Colo. The killers maintained an Internet hate site that
hinted at the massacre-to-come.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really had to scramble to find some Republicans to join
in,'' said Kathryn Montgomery, president of the Center for Media
Education. ``Some Internet folks refused to come because they
thought it smacked too much of a political event.''
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim follows)
</P>
<P>
   Gore's problem was solved, however, when Sen. Ben Nighthorse
Campbell, R-Colo., agreed to join him in the Roosevelt Room, along
with Sen. Leahy, D-Vt. Speaking first, Campbell said, ``Now is not
the time to point fingers.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore ranks among the nation's most computer savvy politician and
clearly hopes to parley that extensive knowledge in the 2000
presidential campaign. But he has also stumbled, earning widespread
scorn by claiming in March that he had ``created'' the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   (end optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   While the direct cause of the killing spree by two Colorado
teenagers remains unknown, polls show that many Americans blame the
tragedy on the supposedly dangerous influence of the Internet --
along with access to firearms, violent TV shows and video games and
poor parenting.
</P>
<P>
   Although there has been talk on Capitol Hill and elsewhere over
the years about the need to improve online protection for young
people, industry leaders clearly felt the need to move quickly to
ease parental concerns in the aftermath of the Colorado shootings.
</P>
<P>
   The 15 firms joining in the voluntary child-protection program
are America Online, AT&AMP;T, (at)Home, Bell Atlantic, Commercial
Internet Exchange, Disney, Excite, Lycos, MCI, Microsoft,
MindSpring Enterprises, Netscape, Network Solutions, Prodigy and
Yahoo!

estranged sister, Denise DeBartolo York, had DeBartolo's
possessions removed from his old office at the 49ers' headquarters
in Santa Clara.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo spokesman Rick Rice said Tuesday that DeBartolo's
belongings _ including a photo of his late mother, Marie _ were
``stuck in drawers and closets'' to make room for other occupants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie's not pleased,'' Rice said. ``It's petty.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, York spokesman Sam Singer said some people secretly
tailed John York while he was in the San Francisco area recently.
York suspects they were paid by his brother-in-law, Singer said.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo knows nothing about anyone following his sister's
husband, Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo's vacant office will be shared by John York and Keith
Lenhart, both vice presidents of the 49ers. ``John and Keith
Lenhart moved his stuff out of there,'' Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   Singer confirmed the move, but cast it in a different light,
saying it was pursuant to the suspension accord DeBartolo reached
with the National Football League in March.
</P>
<P>
   Under that agreement, DeBartolo accepted discipline for his role
in a Louisiana gambling-and-bribery case. The agreement permits
DeBartolo to return to the club in February 2000, but prohibits him
from keeping an office at 49ers' headquarters until then.
</P>
<P>
   Singer said club facilities manager Anthony Lozano was
instructed by York and Lenhart to notify DeBartolo of their plans
``because they need the space and per the commissioner's
instructions.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that when DeBartolo was contacted two weeks ago, the
club co-owner asked only that the photo of his mother be mailed to
him, and it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team needs the space. A lot of people are doubled up,''
Singer said. ``Eddie had very few belongings, and 99 percent of
them were put in drawers in the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   The office adjoins offices occupied by club general manager Bill
Walsh and football operations director John McVay.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo and York co-own the Youngstown, Ohio, family
corporation that owns the team. They are suing each other in courts
in San Francisco and Ohio over alleged misconduct relating to their
legal obligations to each other.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo says he expects to regain control of the team. York
says her intention is to keep the team and run it with the help of
her husband, but she would not rule out a separation of financial
interests, allowing the 49ers to remain in her brother's hands.
</P>
<P>
   A key issue is the club's value. DeBartolo contends York is
legally obligated to sell him her interest in the club, for roughly
$175 million _ half its estimated value, according to DeBartolo.
</P>
<P>
   But York claims the club is worth much more than $350 million,
based on sales of other NFL franchises since late last year.
</P>
<P>
   Singer said that last month John York noticed that he was being
followed during a visit to the San Francisco area to make
preparations for the NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   Rice denied that DeBartolo had hired a private eye to follow
York.
</P>
<P>
   A source in the Yorks' camp also alleged that DeBartolo has
talked to friends and associates about moving the team to Florida,
if and when he wins control of the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie has gone around and said to a variety of people that if
he owned and ran the team, he'd move to Florida,'' said source
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rice said DeBartolo had no plans to move the club to
Florida. ``The team move is absolutely not something Eddie's
talking about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both DeBartolo and the Yorks have said, repeatedly, that they
intend to remain in San Francisco and to build a new stadium for
the 49ers.

AUDIENCE FAVORITES LOOK PAST THE FORT WORTH DALLAS BALLET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORTH WORTH, Texas _ If they were attorneys or politicians or
doctors, they would just be getting started.
</P>
<P>
   But Todd Edson and Maria Thomas are dancers. For over a decade,
together with Maria Terezia Balogh, they were among the most
visible and admired figures at Fort Worth Dallas Ballet. Now in
their 30s, Edson and Thomas are ending their careers with the
company _ but not the way they would have planned.
</P>
<P>
   Artistic director Paul Mejia, whose devotion to the Balanchine
style and repertoire built a loyal, sophisticated audience after he
took over Fort Worth Dallas Ballet in 1987, resigned at the apex of
his career in January 1998, in the midst of a scandal involving
sexual harassment allegations. Benjamin Houk took over as artistic
director in summer 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Balogh, who had married Mejia the previous summer, was initially
listed as a company member for the 1998-99 season but has not
performed under Houk. Thomas and Edson remained with the company
but gradually disappeared from the spotlight. When contract
renewals were issued this year, neither Thomas nor Edson was
offered a new contract.
</P>
<P>
   Edson, 36, has been the company's principal male dancer for more
than a decade in roles ranging from a traditional romantic prince
in ``Cinderella'' to the title role in the cool, mythic ``Apollo''
of Balanchine. This weekend, he will dance with the company for the
last time, performing in ``Coppelia'' in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas quietly ended 12 seasons of Fort Worth performances in
last month's Bass Performance Hall run of ``Coppelia.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas and Edson have declined to talk about their departure
from the company, except to say that it was not their decision.
But, at a recent interview at Edson's 70-year-old house in the
Fairmount neighborhood of Fort Worth, they put a perspective on
moving on.
</P>
<P>
   Edson, who graduated from high school in Arlington and spent a
semester at Rice University in Houston before pursuing dance full
time, has plenty of projects to keep him busy _ including the
renovation of the house, which he shares with his partner, Gregg
Howard.
</P>
<P>
   More dancing is a possibility _ ``I wouldn't rule it out,''
Edson says. However, retirement looms for any dancer after 35. And
performing is not quite as important to Edson now as teaching and
choreographing.
</P>
<P>
   Edson has built a working relationship as a choreographer and
teacher with the Lone Star Ballet in Canyon. He also choreographed
the Dallas performance of the touring ``Salute to Vienna'' New
Year's concert, with conductor Phillipe Entremont.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas began preparing for her departure from ballet when she
was 25 and had a role in Casa Manana's production of Bernstein's
``On the Town,'' in which she mostly danced but spoke a little.
</P>
<P>
   Thus discovering an interest in acting as well as dancing, she
took acting classes. By 1996, she won the role of the tough-talking
lesbian sister of the groom in Alan Ball's ``Five Women Wearing the
Same Dress'' at Circle Theatre in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   This week, she is playing the role of Christina in Casa Manana's
production of ``A Chorus Line'' at Bass Hall; she has also appeared
in local productions of ``Philadelphia Story,'' ``Jake's Women,''
``Oklahoma'' and ``Don't Dress for Dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   The youngest of four children, born and reared in the Chicago
suburb of Roselle, Thomas started dancing at 7. At 15 she joined
the Chicago City Ballet, then directed by Mejia and the renowned
Balanchine ballerina Maria Tallchief. When the Chicago company
closed in 1987, she auditioned for several companies and accepted
an offer from Mejia for a job in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Although Fort Worth Dallas Ballet is a relatively small company
in national terms, Thomas knows that it was a perfect fit for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've danced roles good dancers at larger companies would never
get to dance,'' she says. ``Some dancers are happy being in the
corps at the New York City Ballet, but my goal was to be able to
dance great roles, and I got to,'' she says. ``For 17 years, I got
to work with Paul Mejia. And for 11 years, I got to work with Todd
as a partner; he always knew what I needed. A lot of dancers move
from company to company and never get that continuity. I've been
blessed.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas married company member Frederic Trenary in 1995; Trenary
retired from dancing in 1998 and is working in phone tech support
in the computer field while studying for certification as a
Microsoft systems engineer. Thomas, an animal rights advocate, and
Trenary currently share their secluded east Fort Worth house with
numerous cats. For now, Thomas will continue to develop her acting
skills and credentials with the hope of building her second career,
although she and Trenary intend to have children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be strange not to be in a ballet company,'' she says.
``I decided I was going to be a ballet dancer when I was 10; for so
long, it was my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas might eventually leave Fort Worth, either for the sake of
her career or that of her husband. But Edson thinks that he is not
likely to move.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to Arlington with his family as a teen-ager, when there
was no professional company in Fort Worth. He spent summers at the
School of American Ballet and was a member of the now-defunct
Dallas Ballet in 1984-85, before joining the Fort Worth company in
1986. He dreams of producing a piece of choreography that would be
picked up and performed by major companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always `what-ifs' in life,'' he says, when asked if
he wishes he had pursued a career in a major dance center, rather
than being a big fish in the small pond of Fort Worth. ``Working
with Paul was an education. Just having the chance to do the
Balanchine ballets was exceptional. The ballet board here has been
dedicated, and I owe them my thanks for making this company what it
is. Fort Worth has made itself home for me, and I'm looking forward
to the future.''

 &HT;    INTERNET TO OFFER ONLINE TOOL TO HELP PROTECT KIDS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (a) general news categories
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- In the wake of the Columbine High School killings,
15 of the nation's top Internet firms came together Wednesday to
offer parents a set of easy-to-use tools aimed at protecting their
children from online violence, smut and hate.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the initiative at a bipartisan White House
briefing, Vice President Al Gore said: ``When it comes to the
Internet, too many parents feel now they are faced with a false
choice between unplugging the computer in the family room or
spending every moment of their lives looking over their child's
shoulder to make sure they are not wandering into some dangerous
online alleyway.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry initiative, Gore said, provides ``a third choice
(and) a better way'' -- in the form of a resource guide, dubbed the
``parents protection page.'' When the project is fully implemented
_ by July _ one mouse click from Web sites that account for 95 per
cent of all Internet traffic will take users to the
all-encompassing child-proofing guide.
</P>
<P>
   The service will give parents rapid access to as many as 80
features intended to provide them with more control over their home
computers. From the new protection Web site, parents will be able
to:
</P>
<P>
   - Deploy the latest blocking and filtering programs that can
limit access to violent game sites, hate groups and other materials
that adults deem are bad for children.
</P>
<P>
   - Monitor which Web sites and chat rooms their children have
visited.
</P>
<P>
   - Set time limits on their children's online sessions.
</P>
<P>
   - Get information on how to report criminal activity, with links
to such sites as the National Center for Missing and Exploited
Children tip line.
</P>
<P>
   - Utilize pointers to ``kid-friendly'' sites that offer good
educational content.
</P>
<P>
   Since Gore is the leading Democratic presidential candidate,
some industry leaders feared they would be used in a political
response to the national outcry over last month's slayings in
Littleton, Colo. The killers maintained an Internet hate site that
hinted at the massacre-to-come.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really had to scramble to find some Republicans to join
in,'' said Kathryn Montgomery, president of the Center for Media
Education. ``Some Internet folks refused to come because they
thought it smacked too much of a political event.''
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim follows)
</P>
<P>
   Gore's problem was solved, however, when Sen. Ben Nighthorse
Campbell, R-Colo., agreed to join him in the Roosevelt Room, along
with Sen. Leahy, D-Vt. Speaking first, Campbell said, ``Now is not
the time to point fingers.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore ranks among the nation's most computer savvy politician and
clearly hopes to parley that extensive knowledge in the 2000
presidential campaign. But he has also stumbled, earning widespread
scorn by claiming in March that he had ``created'' the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   (end optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   While the direct cause of the killing spree by two Colorado
teenagers remains unknown, polls show that many Americans blame the
tragedy on the supposedly dangerous influence of the Internet --
along with access to firearms, violent TV shows and video games and
poor parenting.
</P>
<P>
   Although there has been talk on Capitol Hill and elsewhere over
the years about the need to improve online protection for young
people, industry leaders clearly felt the need to move quickly to
ease parental concerns in the aftermath of the Colorado shootings.
</P>
<P>
   The 15 firms joining in the voluntary child-protection program
are America Online, AT&AMP;T, (at)Home, Bell Atlantic, Commercial
Internet Exchange, Disney, Excite, Lycos, MCI, Microsoft,
MindSpring Enterprises, Netscape, Network Solutions, Prodigy and
Yahoo!

DIGITAL STRATEGY FOR SORTING THROUGH SHIFTING IDENTITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By TINA KELLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One high-tech computer aid for tracking people down, often
useful for debt collectors, is made by Infoglide, a company that
has figured out ways to find some people who regularly change their
identities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what clever criminals do,'' said Jay Valentine, chief
executive of Infoglide, in Austin, Texas ``They don't choose
123-45-6789 if they're making up a Social Security number. We can
find similarities with the numbers they use, subtle similarities,
and can put together tremendously strong correlations to show that
they're the same person, trying to get credit as a new person, even
though they're a deadbeat on their other credit files. And we can
create a profile, asking, Is this person likely to respond to us
calling them? Or to a threat? Or a subpoena?''
</P>
<P>
   Infoglide's Fraud Investigator software, which is powered by the
company's Similarity Search Engine, is used by three of the largest
credit bureaus in the country, the company said. It can help
determine similarities in delinquent accounts under different
names.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you are looking for contact information for a
debtor in a large database of accounts receivable, you can enter
the person's full name into the search engine and it will present a
list of possible matches, ranked according to how likely it is that
the entry is for that person. The company gives online examples of
how this works in two scenarios
(www.infoglide.com/pages/thumbdemo.htm).
</P>
<P>
   While the software is often used by debt collectors, it is also
used by people investigating things like insurance fraud and
criminal investigations. The company gives an example of what might
be turned up by such an investigation: ``You notice that the names
seem similar. Could this be the same individual with his name
accidentally mistyped or intentionally altered? You notice that the
first and last names in the similar claim are switched while the
middle name remains the same.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the address is slightly different. The street number has
two transposed digits, 2506 versus 2605. There is a different
apartment number and the ZIP code has 30 in one listing and 03 in
the other. With these similarities in the data, you suspect that
this similar claim is for the same individual.
</P>
<P>
   Either there was a data entry error, or the claimant
intentionally gave your company false data _ data just close enough
to the real information that they could later blame on an `honest
mistake' or `communication error.'''
</P>
<P>
   Credit investigators can look through a variety of databases for
a debtor's name or a close approximation of it, or information like
a Social Security number or address. The software presents 3-D
graphs with towers of data indicating how often a debtor appears in
the database.
</P>
<P>
   Thus records for James Stevens, Jim Stephens and JK Stevns can
appear together, and if there are matches among their addresses or
Social Security numbers, the likelihood that the references are all
for the same person is considered high. Tracers who hit a dead end
looking for James Stevens can find their man by looking for Jim.
</P>
<P>
   Infoglide was founded by David Wheeler, a computer scientist who
developed the search techniques for finding criminals after the
1981 murder of his father went unsolved.
</P>
<P>
   The same technology has been used to crack insurance fraud rings
and to hunt down criminals on the lam. ``Even a slight name change,
like W.J. Davis and Billy Dhaves, will make someone invisible to
most computer systems,'' Valentine said. ``The average person who
is a skipper will modify his or her name six times.''

MY CEREAL PACKS A BIG PUNCH, JUST LIKE ME!
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Friday May 7)  
(rk) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   News item: Tempestuous Baltimore Orioles outfielder Albert Belle
has come out with his own brand of breakfast food called Slugger
Cereal.
</P>
<P>
   First off, I just want to say that I object to the word
``tempestuous.'' The dictionary defines tempestuous as ``violent''
or ``turbulent'' and that is not the way I see myself at all.
</P>
<P>
   It's you (bleeping) people in the (bleeping) media who use words
like this to describe me, which is why it's all I can do to resist
the urge to pick up all of you (bleepers) by your pencil necks and
shake some sense into you.
</P>
<P>
   As you know, I don't usually talk to you media (bleeps) because
all you're interested in is why I ripped a telephone off the
clubhouse wall, upset the buffet table or pushed Hannah Storm down
a flight of stairs, none of which has anything to do with baseball,
which is what I came here to play.
</P>
<P>
   I went 2 for 4 yesterday with a double and a home run and all
you jackals wrote about was that insignificant incident during
batting practice when I jumped into the stands and gave a little
lesson in manners to that mouthy kid with the colostomy bag who had
been pestering me for an autograph.
</P>
<P>
   If you were going to write about anything, you should have
written about how dangerous people like that are because I wound up
cutting my fist on his wheelchair and now I can hardly swing a bat,
even the ones I've filled with cork.
</P>
<P>
   The fans have got to realize that when I'm on the field, I'm at
work and I'm not to be bothered. What would you do if someone came
up to you while you were writing a story and said, ``Hi! You're my
mother's favorite sportswriter! Would you mind signing this cap? It
would really brighten her day at the nursing home!'' I'll tell you
what you'd do. You'd pick the (bleeper) up by his ears and slam him
against a wall or maybe throw him out a window if you happen to
work on one of the upper floors.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, that's what I'd do. But enough about me. I'm here to
talk about my new breakfast cereal called Albert Belle Slugger
Cereal. It doesn't contain any of those (bleeping) vitamins and
minerals that kids hate, plus it's loaded with sugar, so your
little ones will have plenty of energy to deal with anyone who
might try to mess with 'em. Ha ha! I'm just joking, you gullible
(bleepers)! I'm just trying to show you that, yes, Albert Belle is
intense, but he's also got a sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   Take Halloween night a couple of years ago. Some kids were
messin' with me, ringing my doorbell and then running away. You
know, bein' kids. Some other ballplayers might have yelled at the
kids or maybe ignored them until they went away, but Albert Belle
wanted to show these kids that he can take a joke so I hopped in my
Mercedes and took off after them so I could deliver some Halloween
treats to them personally.
</P>
<P>
   Those little (bleepers) were quick, I'll tell you what. The
Orioles could use some speed like that in their lineup. Maybe dress
the players up in Freddy Krueger costumes instead of those silly
outfits with the bird on them. Ha ha! Just another joke, you
(bleepin) morons!
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, I'm fishtailing down the driveway, slingin' gravel
everywhere, trying to catch up with these kids so I could give each
one of 'em a nice, big Hersheys ``kiss'' and they're runnin' away
from me like I'm tryin' to kill 'em or something.
</P>
<P>
   I had to give up after I clipped a mailbox and my car skidded
into somebody's swimming pool, but I think the kids definitely got
the message that Albert Belle is a fun guy to hang out with on
Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I wish the little (bleepers) were here right now so we
could share a bowl of cereal.

   Quince's Performance  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My flowering quince is blooming gloriously. Early spring is
wonderful. But every August, I am ready to yank the shrub because
it looks dead. The leaves have dropped off, and it looks awful. It
is under an ailanthus tree in my New York City garden and gets some
sun during the day. I water the garden during dry spells. Do I need
a dormant oil spray? The leaf dropping has been going on for about
three years. In September or October, the plant sends out new
leaves. It's pitiful to see the struggle. Any suggestions? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Like some great entertainer, flowering quince puts it all on
the line for spring visitors to nurseries and garden centers and
then collapses backstage after the show. The branches are easy to
force into bloom, so they are common at florists from late winter
into spring, helping seduce gardeners into wanting their own.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, because of a widespread malady, quince is
dependable only as a one-season shrub: those spectacular but
short-lived white or orange-to-red flowers, and the bronzy leaves
that are just emerging when the flowers appear, are about all it
has to offer. Once the leaves turn dark green and the flowers fall,
you could pass it by without noticing, until sometime in July or
August, when it begins to defoliate. It is best planted out of the
way so that branches can be clipped to bring in for forcing, but it
is not the ideal front-and-center shrub.
</P>
<P>
   Horticultural oil won't help because the problem is not caused
by an insect, but by the same fungus disease that attacks English
hawthorns. The fungus is spread by rain and survives the winter on
the fallen leaves. If there are English hawthorns in the area, the
disease will be difficult to control. If there are none, and you
don't want to use a fungicide that is labeled for this problem, a
good fall cleanup could reduce the severity, but rainy springs can
bring it right back. Some battles are just not worth the fight, and
this may be one. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Plants for Mean Streets
</P>
<P>
   Q. Please recommend some street-hardy ground covers for tree
pits. I've been considering creeping juniper, lilyturf and vinca,
but I cannot find any information about how these and other ground
covers hold up under the tough conditions between sidewalk and
street, including foot traffic, salt and dogs.
</P>
<P>
   A. Even on the blackest of Mondays, no Wall Street trader ever
faced the kind of stresses found every day in a typical street tree
pit: compacted soil, insufficient water, building shadows,
pollution and salt, all topped off by the innate insensitivity of
neighborhood dogs.
</P>
<P>
   For the trees, ground covers are a two-edged sword. They would
prefer a simple 3-inch layer of mulch to help hold water, not
compete for it. But ground covers usually mean people to tend and
water them, a bonus to a tree that must depend on rainfall, and
sharing is better than no bonus at all.
</P>
<P>
   English ivy and vinca are probably good choices, but because the
growing environment for plants on some streets is worse than on
others, they may not thrive everywhere. Ivy and vinca don't have to
be plain green. Try cultivated varieties of ivy like Buttercup or
Galaxy for variegated or distinctive leaves. Or look for Vinca
minor cultivars like Gertrude Jekyll, with small leaves and white
flowers; Alba, with white flowers, and Atropurpurea, with purple
flowers. All are a nice change from the typical lilac blue.
</P>
<P>
   The Vinca Sterling Silver has beautiful creamy variegated
leaves. Or try some of the more prostrate forms of wintercreeper
(Euonymus fortunei) like Minimus or Longwood. Lilyturf (Liriope
muscari) can handle the street pit, but it needs to be cut back in
late winter; creeping juniper is a full-sun plant and isn't likely
to survive on a typical city street. &QL;

   When to Grow a Lawn
</P>
<P>
   Q. The grounds manager of our condominium says that grass cannot
be planted and grown during the hot summer months. They do grass
repair and replacement in the fall and spring. Can you replace
grass in the summer?
</P>
<P>
   A. Fall and spring really are the right seasons for starting or
renovating a lawn, and considering the number of spring chores most
gardeners face, it's especially comforting to know that putting it
off until the fall isn't procrastination but proper planning.
</P>
<P>
   The lawn grasses typically grown in the Northeast are
cool-season plants, so the heat of June, July and August is hardest
on them, and the worst time to establish new growth. Spring's cool
weather is better, but even so, the warming encourages more leaf
growth at the expense of root growth.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall, as early as September, cooler temperatures and more
frequent rain work to encourage root growth and nutrient storage,
giving the plants better preparation for winter and a faster start
the following spring.
</P>
<P>
   Summer is best for picnics, although I doubt that your grounds
manager gets to go on many. &QL;

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A line of showers and thunderstorms will form ahead of a cold
front sweeping east from the lower Ohio and Tennessee Valleys and
the central Gulf Coast States on Thursday. A few storms may reach
severe levels during the first part of the day as lifting of humid
air from the Gulf of Mexico by the front is augmented by a trailing
jet stream disturbance. Large hail and damaging winds are possible
in a few areas. The threat of severe weather will gradually
diminish thereafter as the jet stream disturbance moves northward.
</P>
<P>
   Moderate to locally heavy rains are possible across portions of
the central Great Lakes region as invading moisture from the Gulf
of Mexico teams with an upper-level low pressure system over Iowa
and arriving jet stream disturbances from the south. Rainfalls
between 1 and 3 inches are possible. Rain may be accompanied by
thunder and small hail in some areas.
</P>
<P>
   Farther west, cool, wind-blown rain will dampen parts of the
northern Plains. Gusty winds from the north will average 15 to 25
mph from the Dakotas to Nebraska. Rainfalls will generally be light
to moderate.
</P>
<P>
   Showers will escort a cold front into the Pacific Northwest
Thursday. In the wake of the front, scattered showers will persist
as a trailing jet stream disturbance arrives from the Pacific.
Later in the day, isolated thunderstorms are possible east of the
Cascades in Washington and Oregon as the disturbance approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and a widely separated showers will affect the northern
Middle Atlantic States as a warm front approaches from the south.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Rare Video
</P>
<P>
   The striking video of two tornadoes attached to the same
thunderstorm over Oklahoma on Monday captured a rare event. The
thinner twister was likely associated with the weakening stages of
a small, rotating low pressure system, called a ``mesocyclone,''
that formed within the thunderstorm. Though deteriorating, the
aging low provided a favorable environment for a new mesocyclone to
form by circulating rain-cooled air in its wake toward warm, humid
air ahead of it. Along the boundary between the contrasting air
masses, a new mesocyclone spawned the massive tornado also shown on
the video.

HOW VOLKSWAGEN GOT THE BEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: During a Volkswagen Jetta commercial, a couple in the car
play a CD and it appears that everything outside the car is moving
to the beat of the music. What is the name of the song and who
recorded it? _ C.P., via the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A: The song, ``Jung at Heart,'' was composed for that commercial
by Peter DuCharme, also known as Master Cylinder.
</P>
<P>
   ``DuCharme was specifically asked to write the music at 94 beats
a minute _ the cadence, it turns out, of a brisk walk _ so that the
physical movement in the ads could be in harmony with the chords,''
according to ``AdWeek.'' ``During the shoot, that beat was blared
over loudspeakers.''
</P>
<P>
   The song isn't available yet on CD, but Volkswagen has made it
available for free download on the World Wide Web at
www3.vw.com/vwworld/music.htm.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why is K used as an abbreviation for 1,000 in terms like the
``Y2K problem''? _ O.M., Arlington, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: K is an abbreviation for kilo, the Greek word meaning ``one
thousand'' that also shows up in metric terms such as kilogram and
kilometer.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K is shorthand for the year 2000, and it appears most often
when describing computer problems anticipated to occur on Jan. 1,
2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K problem involves computer programs and hardware that
represent years as two digits instead of four: 99 instead of 1999,
98 for 1998, and so on. The changeover from year ``99'' to year
``00'' is expected to cause many computers to run incorrectly or
stop running entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I obtain Dash laundry detergent? _ L.N., via the
Internet
</P>
<P>
   A: Dash, introduced by Procter &AMP; Gamble in 1929, is not
presently being sold in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   The detergent is one of the company's main brands in France,
Germany, Italy, Spain and other countries in Europe, the Middle
East and Africa.

PHONES AT A PREMIUM ON THE ALBANIAN BEAT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The refugee crisis in Albania has given birth to a minor crisis
of a different sort: journalists in need of mobile phones. At the
beginning of April, the state-owned monopoly provider of mobile
service, Albania Mobile Communications, canceled the roaming
agreements that allowed subscribers from foreign services to make
calls on its network. ``Our system was overloaded, mostly by
journalists,'' said Rauf Elmas, an Albania Mobile executive.
</P>
<P>
   That severance led to not only an onslaught of complaints from
roaming partners, but opportunity for certain Albanians. Albania
Mobile subscribers and distributors are ``renting'' the cards that
digitally identify them as customers of the Albanian provider when
inserted into handsets compatible with GSM, the European standard
for mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
   When NBC News set up shop in Albania, they took Iridium
satellite phones and GSM phones they had rented from an American
company, Cellhire. When the GSM phones failed, NBC ended up renting
three Albania Mobile cards and phones. ``It's unbelievable what
they charge _ $900 a month just for the phone, and usage is
extra,'' said Ira Kurti, an Albanian working as an assistant
producer and translator for NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Elmas of Albania Mobile said that the problem should be
alleviated by the end of June, when Albania's capacity will be
expanded to 20,000 subscribers from 8,000. He said that at least
400 Albania Mobile cards were being rented to journalists by
regular subscribers and that he even had a friend who had purchased
four subscriptions, anticipating that foreign journalists would
need to call home.
</P>
<P>
   ``These events have been very convenient for Albanians who have
phone cards,'' he said.

   WIRELESS E-MAIL LINKED TO A PAGER
</P>
<P>
   SkyTel Communications Inc., together with American Mobile
Satellite Corp. and pager manufacturer Research in Motion (RIM)
Ltd. earlier this week announced a nationwide wireless e-mail
service that operates with a new RIM pager.
</P>
<P>
   Available next month, the new service, dubbed eLink, will allow
users to send and receive wireless messages using their existing
e-mail address, rather than adopting an address unique to the
paging service.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can read your mail and reply and when the recipient gets
the message, it looks like you replied right from your desktop,''
said Dan Croft, vice president of messaging services at American
Mobile, which owns a satellite and terrestrial communications
network. ``They have no idea that you sent it wirelessly.''
</P>
<P>
   The new RIM Interactive Pager 850 carries a suggested retail
price of $359. It includes a docking cradle that simultaneously
recharges the pager's battery and synchronizes address book,
calendar, and to-do information with a desktop PC.
</P>
<P>
   The eLink service will cost $59.95 per month. Croft said the
high price will confine the service to the corporate sector,
placing it out of reach for most home users. ``We're still a couple
of years away from the consumer wanting wireless access at an
affordable price away from home,'' he said.
</P>

<P>
   VIEWING THE PC THROUGH EYEGLASS LENSES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wearable computers have gotten their share of hype over the last
few years, but even technologists will admit that bulky gadgets
aren't in vogue. MicroOptical, a company in Westwood, Mass., aims
to change that with what it calls EyeGlass Displays, or EGDs for
short.
</P>
<P>
   A person wearing the glasses can view Web pages, pager numbers,
television, or any other visual information by looking through the
lenses. The information comes from a palm-sized computer that
attaches to the viewer's belt. Thin cables from the computer carry
the data behind the ears, to a microdisplay unit at the temple. The
microdisplay sends the picture through the lens, which contain
embedded mirrors that reflect information into the viewer's eye.
When the computer is on, the picture looks like a miniature
computer screen floating in front of your face. When the computer
is turned off, the EGD can be used like a normal pair of
eyeglasses.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Holzel, MicroOptical's vice-president of sales and
marketing, is now marketing the EGDs, as well as a clip-on version,
to medical-instrumentation companies. Doctors could use the glasses
to get critical medical information without having to look away
from a patient, Holzel said. ``Or you could go into movie
theater,'' he added, ``and get subtitles that only you would see.''

   PRODIGIOUS USE OF PRODIGY LEADS TO TERMINATION
</P>
<P>
   You might think that the meaning of the word ``unlimited'' is
very clear but, if you're Internet service provider is Prodigy,
think again. The company, which advertises ``unlimited service''
for $19.95, recently informed more than 100 customers that their
accounts would be terminated because of excessive usage.
</P>
<P>
   The customers, who pay $19.95 a month for unlimited service,
were told that their accounts would be terminated because they had
been identified as excessive users, said Dan Levine, a Prodigy
spokesman. Although there is no specific cap on the number of hours
a customer can stay connected, Levine said, ``We identified during
routine network maintenance a number of accounts where the
excessively high levels of activity were symptomatic of improper
activity.''
</P>
<P>
   In March, Prodigy sent email to nearly 300 excessive users to
``ask if they were forgetting to log off or if a user's password
was stolen and used by someone else,'' Levine said. Customers who
did not respond received a follow-up message a few weeks later,
Levine said. ``The language was stronger. But if they have a
legitimate reason for being connected for so many hours, we won't
terminate their accounts. We heard, for example from a few users
who said they were permanently disabled and needed to maintain a
constant connection to the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Internet service providers that advertise unlimited
service also try to limit usage. For instance, both Mindspring and
America Online employ features to automatically log off any
customer whose computer remains idle. Mindspring will log off a
customer after 30 minutes of idle time; AOL will log off a customer
after 10 minutes. Prodigy, however, has no idle disconnect feature.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's actually considered a benefit of our service,'' said
Levine of Prodigy. ``But that's why we're trying to change the
behavior of people who routinely log on and then don't log off even
when they walk away from the computer for hours.''

   CELEBRATING AN ANNIVERSARY FOR BAR-CODE SCANNERS
</P>
<P>
   Attention, presidential candidates: May 5 marked the silver
anniversary of the bar-code scanner. Twenty-five years earlier, the
NCR Corp. introduced the device at the 1974 annual convention of
the Super Market Institute. Six weeks later, a ten-pack of
Wrigley's Juicy Fruit gum became the first retail item ever to be
purchased with the technology when it was swiped across a scanner
at the Marsh Supermarket in Troy, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The White House greeted the Universal Product Code and bar
scanners with enthusiasm _ ``It's the wave of the future, and I'm
very upbeat on the system,'' said Virginia Knauer, special
assistant for consumer affairs to the president of the United
States _ but the technology didn't always return the favor. In
1992, President George Bush, fighting the impression that he was
out of touch with voters, was pilloried for being allegedly amazed
when he saw one of the then-ubiquitous scanners in action.

MAGIC-CARPET CHAIRS OF VIRTUAL REALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LISA GUERNSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a seat in a chair of the future.
</P>
<P>
   Put your feet up in the Flostation, for example, and immerse
yourself in a virtual-reality landscape, accompanied by sounds,
video, vibrations and aromas that match the scenery.
</P>
<P>
   Try a huge leather office chair called Smartspace, with its own
Internet connection, video projectors, display screens and embedded
speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Or sit down in an ``augmented smart chair'' that senses your
every move _ and then corrects your posture.
</P>
<P>
   All three chairs are being developed by researchers who are
determined to make a piece of furniture that is more than a place
to sit. They envision chairs that are part computer, part
multimedia space, part communication device.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal was to wipe the slate clean,'' said Brian Park, the
developer of the Flostation. He said he had wanted to break away
from the traditional notion of a chair that is pulled up to a desk
to face a boxy computer monitor. ``I wanted to make it really an
experience within cyberspace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   You won't find these chairs in an Ethan Allen showroom any time
soon, but Park has opened an online business called Flogiston
(www.flogiston.com) and is starting to sell the Flostation chair
for about $5,000. (The name Flogiston comes from phlogiston, the
name of an imaginary element once thought to be given off during
burning. The 18th-century quest for phlogiston marked a transition
between chemistry and alchemy; Smart thinks that today's
intellectual understanding of cyberspace is in a similar
transition.)
</P>
<P>
   The Smartspace chair (innovate.bt.com/showcase/smartspace) is a
little farther away from the marketplace. British
Telecommunications hatched the idea and is in the process of
licensing it to a yet-undisclosed commercial manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   The augmented smart chair is a research project that started at
the Media Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
and is now being continued at Purdue University. Hong Z. Tan, a
Purdue engineering professor who is leading the project, says that
its still too early to predict when the chair might become a
commercial product, but prototypes have already been tested at MIT.
</P>
<P>
   The Flostation is devoted to entertainment and relaxation. It is
designed to help people experience virtual reality in comfort,
without having to stand up and don a bulky helmet. When seated in
the reclined chair, your body is almost lying down, with your knees
slightly bent _ the same position that Park says is most
comfortable to astronauts in zero gravity. He calls it the human
body's most comfortable state.
</P>
<P>
   The chair is topped with a metal dome that can be pulled over
your head, much like the hair dryers in many beauty salons. The
inside of the dome becomes a 180-degree screen that displays images
or videos from a nearby projector that is connected to a computer
or television. The projector works like the rear-projection devices
within high-end television screens, which display an image on the
front and back of the screen at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Speakers near the ears of the person in the Flostation _ Park
calls them ``nearphones'' _ provide sound, and shakers under the
chair provide low-frequency vibrations. A joystick or keyboard is
necessary to interact with the projected images. Park is working on
the chair's next component: an aromatherapy system that will emit
the perfume of herbal oils.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I focus on is comfort and relaxation for extended
immersion in a virtual space,'' Park said.
</P>
<P>
   He came up with the idea for the chair several years ago, when
he was a researcher for NASA, designing a training system for
astronauts. But now the technology exists to make the chairs a
viable commercial product, he said. He hopes to sell them to
airports, resorts and cruise ships. He also sees potential for the
chair as a high-end entertainment unit, for use in the home or in
virtual-reality playgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Smartspace chair, on the other hand, may first show up in
office buildings. Scientists in British Telecomm's research
laboratory developed the Smartspace to get a glimpse of how
business people may be interacting with one another in the future.
``This is a concept of what your desk may look like in a few years'
time,'' said John V. Collins, a research scientist at British
Telecomm.
</P>
<P>
   This chair-desk hybrid does not include a keyboard, mouse or
typical computer monitor. Its main feature is a vertical wraparound
screen that is pulled around you after you have been seated; images
are projected from two cameras perched near the sitter's shoulders
onto the screen. The chair also includes a small horizontal screen
that floats above your lap once you have been latched in and uses
touch-screen technology instead of a keyboard. People have an
easier time focusing on their work when they are looking down on
it, Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Interactive work, like participating in teleconferences or
looking at large graphics, would be done using the wraparound
screen, which has a liquid-crystal display and can become opaque or
transparent at the touch of a button. A user could turn on the
screen to go into a teleconference or concentrate on an individual
project, then turn off the screen to see and interact with people
nearby. That flexibility became an important part of the design,
Collins said, after British Telecomm researchers realized that
people did not like the idea of putting on helmets to experience
immersive cyberspace, at least not at the office.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a virtual-reality helmet, you are cut off,'' he said.
``They are uncomfortable. And you feel a bit like an idiot wearing
it.''
</P>
<P>
   While both the Flostation and the Smartspace look quite
different from chairs we are used to, the sensing chair that Ms.
Tan is developing at Purdue may have a less futuristic appearance.
Its sensors are designed to be invisible to the user, embedded in
the seat cushions.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tan declined to discuss the project at this early stage. But
Alex Pentland, the academic head of the MIT Media Lab and Ms. Tan's
adviser during her doctoral work, describes the sensors as air
pockets lined with something like aluminum foil. As the air pockets
are squeezed, pieces of the lining come closer together, and
electronic sensing is possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the seat could react a little bit to you, it could say:
`Oh, he's been in one position for too long. Let's just change the
pressure system a little to get him to move,'' Pentland said. He
imagined the chair's being used in automobiles and airplanes. If
the chair was incorporated into automobiles, he added, it could
also include a subtle vibrating system that would send messages
from other sensors in and on the car. Bus drivers might feel a
slight tickle, for example, to warn them that another vehicle had
pulled up behind them.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the chair of the future will combine elements of all three
new concepts: a relaxing, multimedia work space with a vibrating
message system. It would be missing only one thing: a cup holder.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Their very names are evocative: ``The Empire Builder,'' ``The
Sunset Limited'' and ``The Coast Starlight.'' They are among the
last of the great trains that cross the United States, recalling a
time when rail travel was the only way to go. Even today, a
well-planned rail journey can recapture much of the old romance of
the rails. There are multi-day, cross-country routes in the United
States on Amtrak and in Canada on Via Rail, as well as two-day
daylight trips through the _ on the Rocky Mountaineer to choose
from.
 &HT;    Train travel is all about slowing down and making the journey a
part of the vacation. Fortunately, the comfort level has risen of
late. The much-beleaguered Amtrak has updated its cars and improved
levels of service and food in the past five years. While coach
travel remains an economical option, travel by sleeper car can
really transform a train journey.
 &HT;    Sleepers require first class fares on Amtrak and include all
meals. Standard bedrooms have two reclining seats that convert to a
bed. Deluxe bedrooms, which are about 30 percent more expensive and
come with a private bathroom, are designed for two passengers and
feature a sofa and armchair that convert to an upper and lower
berth.
 &HT;    Amtrak pricing is rather complicated and not unlike airline
pricing. There's a set charge for a sleeper compartment, and then
fare charges for each passenger which are based on a variety of
factors, including the season and the day of the week. Contact
Amtrak (60 Massachusetts Ave. N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002;
800-USA-RAIL/www.amtrak.com) for current pricing. Note that making
multiple stops is a popular option, as is the North America Rail
Pass, which provides 30 days of unlimited travel in both the U.S.
and Canada for a 90-day period.
 &HT;    What are the most exciting overnight routes in the United
States? Start with ``The Sunset Limited,'' which runs from Orlando
to Los Angeles by way of New Orleans and Houston, some 3,000 miles
across the county, an eight-state journey from Florida to
California. Then there's ``The Empire Builder,'' which leaves from
Chicago and goes to either Portland or Seattle. This train through
Big Sky country brings travelers face to face with the Bear Paw
Mountains, Glacier National Park, the Rockies and the Cascades.
 &HT;    The ``California Zephyr'' runs from Chicago through three
mountain ranges, two deserts and alongside the Colorado River for a
couple of hundred miles before arriving in greater San Francisco.
Many diehard train buffs as well as first-timers claim that this is
the most beautiful train ride in the United States. From the
breadbasket of America to the Rockies, from the Wasatch Mountains
and into Salt Lake City, the train continues to Reno, the mile-high
Donner Pass and then down to Sacramento and into Oakland.
 &HT;    ``The Coast Starlight'' runs from Los Angeles to Seattle. It's
Amtrak's most popular train and it literally hugs the Pacific
coast, from southern California all the way up to Santa Barbara,
and then to San Francisco, into Oregon and finally Washington. Only
``The Coast Starlight'' has the Pacific Parlour Car, a customized
lounge car for first class travelers.
 &HT;    ``The Cardinal'' links Washington D.C. with Chicago via the
riverfront city of Cincinnati, through the Blue Ridge Mountains of
Virginia and along the New River Gorge in West Virginia, with a
U.S. Forest Ranger providing commentary at apt moments.
 &HT;    On VIA Rail Canada's (P.O. Box 8116, Station A, Montreal,
Quebec, Canada H3C 3N3; 800-561-9181 www.viarail.ca) trains in the
East, Easterly Class offers private bedrooms with a bathroom and a
shared shower while semi-private seating converts to a curtained
berth by night. On VIA Rail trains in Western Canada, Silver &AMP; Blue
Class bedrooms sleep two with a private bathroom. Less expensive is
semi-private seating that converts to curtained berths at night,
with shared bathrooms.
 &HT;    In Canada, ``The Ocean'' is the train that runs between
Montreal, Quebec and Halifax, Nova Scotia. The scenic way to pass
from French-speaking Quebec into the Maritimes, this train speeds
along the southern shore of the St. Lawrence, past Riviere-du-Loup
through the Matapedia Valley to Baie des Chaleurs. From there, it
continues on to New Brunswick, through Moncton, into Amherst, Nova
Scotia and finally to Halifax.
 &HT;    ``The Canadian'' runs from Toronto, Ontario to Vancouver,
British Columbia. The most famous train ride in North America
crosses two-thirds of Canada, from the endless forest of Ontario to
the surreal plains of Manitoba and the wheat fields of Saskatchewan
before reaching the heart of the Rockies in Jasper, where elk
wander through the streets. Continuing through the Rockies, the
train cuts through the high desert of British Columbia before
reaching the coastal rain forest and Vancouver, a journey of 2,770
miles.
 &HT;    Finally, Rocky Mountaineer Railtours (1150 Station Street,
Vancouver, B.C. Canada V6A 2X7; 800-665-7245;
www.rockymountaineer.com) makes two-day daylight trips through the
Canadian Rockies on the Rocky Mountaineer, traveling from Vancouver
to either Jasper, Banff or Calgary, Alberta, with overnight hotel
stay in Kamloops, British Columbia. For Signature Service, prices
start at $362 per person and include the overnight stay and some
meals.

 By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    If anyone tells you that mature travelers can't make a walking
tour of Tuscany, they're wrong. Bernie Lee (72-years-old) and his
wife, Helen, (62-years-old) are living proof: Last October they
hiked up to Cortona, Montepulciano, Pienza, Montalcino, Siena and
San Gimignano _ some of the most beautiful hill towns in Tuscany.
 &HT;    The Lees suggest that mature travelers get in shape before
undertaking a Tuscany walking trip. It's ill-advised to think you
can get up off the couch, go to Italy and start walking. Some
Tuscan hills rise 2,000 feet and more, and the most beautiful towns
are situated on top.
 &HT;    Both Lees are retired _ he from advertising, she from banking _
and live in Oregon in a house at 900-feet elevation. But since they
rarely walk to their home, they sought their doctors' OK to go
climbing in Tuscany which was also required by their tour company's
health questionnaire. The only extra shot their doctors recommended
was Hepatitis B.
 &HT;    Both exercise regularly. Helen does water aerobics three
mornings a week, and Bernie walks two miles and lifts weights. But
what saved the Lees in Tuscany was their homemade training program
of weekly 5-mile walk begun a month prior to departure.
 &HT;    According to the travel brochure from their tour company,
Ciclismo Classico, which books biking and walking tours from
offices at 13 Marathon St., Arlington, Mass. 02474 (call 800
866-7314), they would be walking four to six miles per day. But as
it turned out, some days they walked ten miles.
 &HT;    Lee especially remembers the sunny afternoon when they were on
their way from Montichiello to Pienza. After walking for about two
hours _ through farmers' fields and along a blacktop back-road _ he
looked across a broad valley where silver-green olive trees
shimmered in the heat. Beyond was their destination: A distant
pine-topped hill where the ancient wall of Pienza glowed in the
golden afternoon light.
 &HT;    He remembers sweating up the hill as the pines, but not Pienza,
got closer.
 &HT;    ``Forty minutes later,'' he recalls, ``I reached the trees and
saw that lying road make a right-angle turn, loop down the hill,
meander across another wide valley and then climb a longer, steeper
hill to Pienza's gate!''
 &HT;    Two hours later, he walked through the gate, tired and sweaty,
but grateful for their pre-trip exercise routine that had paid off
with extra stamina.
 DINING  
 &HT;    The Lees' hotel breakfast fare consisted of juice, coffee, tea,
great bread and croissants, cheese and/or thin slivers of
prosciutto. During eight days in Tuscany, they never saw an egg.
 &HT;    But the dinners! In Pienza at a restaurant located inside the
gate, the Lees say they ate one of life's memorable meals. They sat
down at 8 p.m. and the food kept coming for the next two hours:
appetizers, soup, pasta, vegetables, salad, two meat dishes
(including wild boar) and dessert.
 ARTICULATE AND ATTRACTIVE GUIDES  
 &HT;    Natives of Tuscany, the Lee's guides were proud of their land
and happy to share their knowledge of its history, art and culture.
Guido Giuntini, 34, is tall, athletic and a graduate in political
science, while 29-year old Angelica Turi is petite, fair, and works
in art restoration in Florence.
 &HT;    Near Cortona, Turi stood in a tiny cell in gray Etruscan tomb
and talked about the people who had built the structure in 900 B.C.
and the type of stone they used.
 &HT;    South of Siena, Giuntini led the group across a drawbridge and
into a beautiful Benedictine monastery founded in 1313, the remote
abbey of Mount Oliveto Maggiore. Inside the great cloister, whose
four walls seem alive with huge paintings depicting the life of St.
Benedict, Giuntini showed the group how to read the 36 frescoes by
artists Sodoma and Signorelli.
 &HT;    Occasionally the guides brought in other Tuscan experts _ an
archaeologist in Cortona, a historian in Siena and a wine maker in
Montalcino. Their tour also included side trips to a centuries-old
crystal workshop and to an olive oil factory.
 HITCHING A LIFT  
 &HT;    On some side trips the Lees' tour group rode in a van, which was
also available to walkers on long hikes who needed to hitch a ride.
The van was always ready in the event of an emergency and the
guides carried first-aid kits and cellular phones to contact the
van or the nearest hospital/helicopter service if needed.
 &HT;    Giuntini says most of the people on walking tours are over 50.
The Lees' group had a few 40-year-olds, but most travelers were in
their 50s, 60s or 70s.
 NO PROBLEM  
 &HT;    The Lees had no trouble with water in Italy. Or, with
communication. Italians are pros at reading gestures and
expressions, although they appreciate your efforts to speak their
language.
 &HT;    They recommend walkers take a small backpack or waistpack for
camera, binoculars, light rain jacket and water bottle.
Specifically, they suggest a pack with a handy bottle pocket.
 &HT;    Also recommended are comfortable, well-fitting walking shoes _
particularly high-tops _ to support ankles on rough trails and
cobblestone streets. To prevent blisters, the Lees suggest a thin
pair of socks over thicker walking socks.
 &HT;    Accommodations on the Tuscany walking tours were, according to
the Lees, on par with the not-bad hotels in Fresno or Keokuk.
However, the hotels are located atop hills and boast spectacular
views.
 &HT;    The Lees paid $2,250 for this eight-day tour, including hotels,
breakfasts, two picnics and six dinners.
 &HT;    ``A little spendy,'' according to Helen. Bernie agrees, ``Maybe
so. But we had a wonderful time in Tuscany.''
 &HT;    
 WALKS FOR SENIORS  
 &HT;    Hundreds of companies around the world package walking trips,
but some are ideal for mature travelers. Brochures rate them by
difficulty, van support and all meals. Walks can range up to ten
miles a day, but those designed for seniors are usually a bit
shorter.

lodge-based walking trips limited to travelers 50 years and older
in Alaska, Colorado and other parts of the West and Northwest.
(719) 531-9577.
 &HT;    Walking the World packages hiking trips just for seniors that
include places ranging from Hawaii's volcanoes to New Zealand's
Milford Track. (800) 340-9255.
 &HT;    Walk Your Way. Rosemary O'Chris, who grew up in England, leads
low-key hikes through places like the Cotswolds, Dorset Villages
and the Lake District. Many are circular walks with light
day-packs, based in a single village. (970) 881-2709.
 &HT;    ElderTreks' demanding series of worldwide trips, limited to
active seniors, often includes back-packing and camping out in
places like the Australian Outback, Galapagos and Borneo. (416)
588-5000.
 &HT;    Mount Robson Adventure Holidays ``Fifty Plus Adventures''
include shorter scenic walks in the shadow of Canada's highest
peak, plus bird-watching, canoeing and rafting. (250) 566-4386.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Their very names are evocative: ``The Empire Builder,'' ``The
Sunset Limited'' and ``The Coast Starlight.'' They are among the
last of the great trains that cross the United States, recalling a
time when rail travel was the only way to go. Even today, a
well-planned rail journey can recapture much of the old romance of
the rails. There are multi-day, cross-country routes in the United
States on Amtrak and in Canada on Via Rail, as well as two-day
daylight trips through the _ on the Rocky Mountaineer to choose
from.
 &HT;    Train travel is all about slowing down and making the journey a
part of the vacation. Fortunately, the comfort level has risen of
late. The much-beleaguered Amtrak has updated its cars and improved
levels of service and food in the past five years. While coach
travel remains an economical option, travel by sleeper car can
really transform a train journey.
 &HT;    Sleepers require first class fares on Amtrak and include all
meals. Standard bedrooms have two reclining seats that convert to a
bed. Deluxe bedrooms, which are about 30 percent more expensive and
come with a private bathroom, are designed for two passengers and
feature a sofa and armchair that convert to an upper and lower
berth.
 &HT;    Amtrak pricing is rather complicated and not unlike airline
pricing. There's a set charge for a sleeper compartment, and then
fare charges for each passenger which are based on a variety of
factors, including the season and the day of the week. Contact
Amtrak (60 Massachusetts Ave. N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002;
800-USA-RAIL/www.amtrak.com) for current pricing. Note that making
multiple stops is a popular option, as is the North America Rail
Pass, which provides 30 days of unlimited travel in both the U.S.
and Canada for a 90-day period.
 &HT;    What are the most exciting overnight routes in the United
States? Start with ``The Sunset Limited,'' which runs from Orlando
to Los Angeles by way of New Orleans and Houston, some 3,000 miles
across the county, an eight-state journey from Florida to
California. Then there's ``The Empire Builder,'' which leaves from
Chicago and goes to either Portland or Seattle. This train through
Big Sky country brings travelers face to face with the Bear Paw
Mountains, Glacier National Park, the Rockies and the Cascades.
 &HT;    The ``California Zephyr'' runs from Chicago through three
mountain ranges, two deserts and alongside the Colorado River for a
couple of hundred miles before arriving in greater San Francisco.
Many diehard train buffs as well as first-timers claim that this is
the most beautiful train ride in the United States. From the
breadbasket of America to the Rockies, from the Wasatch Mountains
and into Salt Lake City, the train continues to Reno, the mile-high
Donner Pass and then down to Sacramento and into Oakland.
 &HT;    ``The Coast Starlight'' runs from Los Angeles to Seattle. It's
Amtrak's most popular train and it literally hugs the Pacific
coast, from southern California all the way up to Santa Barbara,
and then to San Francisco, into Oregon and finally Washington. Only
``The Coast Starlight'' has the Pacific Parlour Car, a customized
lounge car for first class travelers.
 &HT;    ``The Cardinal'' links Washington D.C. with Chicago via the
riverfront city of Cincinnati, through the Blue Ridge Mountains of
Virginia and along the New River Gorge in West Virginia, with a
U.S. Forest Ranger providing commentary at apt moments.
 &HT;    On VIA Rail Canada's (P.O. Box 8116, Station A, Montreal,
Quebec, Canada H3C 3N3; 800-561-9181 www.viarail.ca) trains in the
East, Easterly Class offers private bedrooms with a bathroom and a
shared shower while semi-private seating converts to a curtained
berth by night. On VIA Rail trains in Western Canada, Silver &AMP; Blue
Class bedrooms sleep two with a private bathroom. Less expensive is
semi-private seating that converts to curtained berths at night,
with shared bathrooms.
 &HT;    In Canada, ``The Ocean'' is the train that runs between
Montreal, Quebec and Halifax, Nova Scotia. The scenic way to pass
from French-speaking Quebec into the Maritimes, this train speeds
along the southern shore of the St. Lawrence, past Riviere-du-Loup
through the Matapedia Valley to Baie des Chaleurs. From there, it
continues on to New Brunswick, through Moncton, into Amherst, Nova
Scotia and finally to Halifax.
 &HT;    ``The Canadian'' runs from Toronto, Ontario to Vancouver,
British Columbia. The most famous train ride in North America
crosses two-thirds of Canada, from the endless forest of Ontario to
the surreal plains of Manitoba and the wheat fields of Saskatchewan
before reaching the heart of the Rockies in Jasper, where elk
wander through the streets. Continuing through the Rockies, the
train cuts through the high desert of British Columbia before
reaching the coastal rain forest and Vancouver, a journey of 2,770
miles.
 &HT;    Finally, Rocky Mountaineer Railtours (1150 Station Street,
Vancouver, B.C. Canada V6A 2X7; 800-665-7245;
www.rockymountaineer.com) makes two-day daylight trips through the
Canadian Rockies on the Rocky Mountaineer, traveling from Vancouver
to either Jasper, Banff or Calgary, Alberta, with overnight hotel
stay in Kamloops, British Columbia. For Signature Service, prices
start at $362 per person and include the overnight stay and some
meals.

MOUNTAIN CLIMBING AS A SPECTATOR SPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Peter Dizikes is a freelance writer and recreational climber who
lives in New York.  
 By PETER DIZIKES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Armchair mountaineering is a time-honored tradition among those
seeking vicarious thrills from the comfort of their own homes. In
the last few years, however, it has been supplemented by a new
occupation: desktop mountaineering, the practice of following a
climbing expedition on the Web as its members try to reach the
summit of one of the world's greatest peaks. And May is the
beginning of peak climbing season.
</P>
<P>
   Mount Everest, for instance, has seen a huge increase in foot
traffic in the 1990s. But record numbers of people have also paid a
virtual visit to Everest, the world's highest mountain, in the last
few years.
</P>
<P>
   Some 20 expeditions (and at least 150 climbers) are trying
Everest this year, and more than a dozen have their own Web sites,
with journal-style dispatches, photos, route maps, audio and video
clips, and thumbnail Everest histories. Far from being a remote
adventure, high-altitude mountaineering is now a spectator sport.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always this way, of course. Sir Edmund Hillary, of New
Zealand, and Tenzing Norgay, a Sherpa guide, were the first
climbers to reach Everest's summit, on May 29, 1953. The news of
the feat, by a British expedition, reached the public on June 2
(the day of Queen Elizabeth's inauguration, by happy coincidence) _
and the news moved that fast only because The London Times had sent
a correspondent, James Morris, to Nepal.
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed: James Morris now writes as Jan Morris, and
when Everest is climbed today, the public knows about it before the
climbers are off the mountain. Climbers radio from the top down to
base camp, where team members call home on satellite phones. Then
expedition Web sites quickly post updates that read like breaking
news, even if there is a little lag time.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the Web, desktop mountaineers now get a taste of the
unfolding anxiety and uncertainty faced by real mountaineers. Take
Carolyn Hahn, a writer living in New York, who, along with other
family members, uses the Web to follow the feats of her brother
Dave, a professional climber who has reached the Everest summit and
sent witty Web dispatches back from the mountain in each of the
last two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only know what's on the Web,'' she said. ``When two climbers
died on his route last year, we got an e-mail saying he was OK But
otherwise, I just read the same updates as everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web would be well suited to accounts of climbing feats even
without this immediacy. Good sites include abundant photographs
(most can be enlarged with a click) and other visual effects,
combining them with text in creative ways to give readers more of
that elusive you-are-there feeling than can be had while curled up
in an armchair with a book or magazine. With so many sites, though,
it may not be clear where to begin. Here are a few ways to make the
mountains come to you. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (italics)``Into Thin Air,'' a book by Jon Krakauer about the
1996 climbing disaster on Mount Everest, spent a long time atop the
best-seller list, and the Imax film ``Everest'' enjoyed a long run
in theaters. If you want to find out more about the disaster, in
which five people died, here are a few Web sites related to it and

   THE MOUNTAIN ZONE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   www.mountainzone.com &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A commercial site with plenty of high-end gadgetry at its
disposal, the Mountain Zone, based in Seattle, has done more than
any other site to move climbing into the virtual world. For
climbing fans, a significant part of the site's attraction is that
it follows the stars of American mountaineering, who are paid to
send in reports as correspondents.
</P>
<P>
   The Mountain Zone is currently providing updates from three
Himalayan expeditions. One team is attempting the unprecedented
triple play of climbing the south side of Everest, then its two
adjoining neighbors, Lhotse (the world's fourth-highest peak) and
Nuptse.
</P>
<P>
   Another group is on the north side of Everest, searching for
evidence of the expedition of George Mallory and Andrew Irvine,
Everest pioneers who did not return from their 1924 climb. On
Sunday, these climbers announced that they had found Mallory's body
and would continue to search for more evidence.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, Ed Viesturs, who is America's best-known climber
and is prominently featured in ``Everest,'' an Imax film, is
closing in on a highly coveted mountaineering prize: scaling all 14
of the world's peaks measuring 8,000 meters (more than 26,000 feet)
or more. With his climb of Dhaulagiri on Tuesday, Viesturs' tally
is at 12.
</P>
<P>
   The dispatches sent back to Seattle by climbers on all three
teams make up the heart of the coverage. These are either progress
reports or, on rest days, a chance for climbers to reflect on their
calling. Pete Athans, the south-side team leader, recently invoked
T.S. Eliot's poetry to describe his awe of Everest _ ``the object
of all our exploring is to arrive at the beginning and know the
place for the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Many dispatches are transcripts of satellite phone or radio
calls from base camp and above. I listen to these using the Windows
Media Player, although Real Playeralso works. Most have been casual
briefings from lower elevations on Everest, but when Viesturs
climbed Dhaulagiri Tuesday, he radioed down an hour later, in a
voice strained with fatigue. The recent dispatches about Mallory's
body are also available as audio clips.
</P>
<P>
   The most spectacular parts of the Mountain Zone's Everest
coverage are its video clips and 360-degree photos. The former
(which require Real Player) include an airplane fly-by of Everest.
Even better are the photos posted by the south-siders. The images
automatically pan like video clips when loaded, but they can be
controlled by mouse, and it is possible to zoom in (although much
sharpness is lost).
</P>
<P>
   The 360-degree photo from Camp 1, with Everest, Lhotse and
Nuptse looming overhead, is by itself worth a trip to the site. My
favorite shows the Thyangboche monastery on the trek in: animals
graze serenely with Everest visible in the distance. To find the
images, go to the south-side dispatches, then click on the Features
and Multimedia links.
</P>
<P>
   The Mountain Zone is, however, unabashedly commercial.
Advertisements line the site, and an Everest Store sells all manner
of memorabilia. So far I have resisted buying replica Sherpa prayer
flags for $29.95; my visits feel authentic enough already. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EVEREST NEWS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   www.everestnews.com  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With a homespun feel and few visual offerings, Everest News is
the antithesis of the Mountain Zone. Nonetheless, it has also
become a virtual base camp for desktop mountaineers. The site
provides two attractive services: news updates from Everest and
other major peaks, posted a few times a day during the spring and
summer, and links to the Web sites of nearly every major
expedition.
</P>
<P>
   Using an impressive network of climbers, Sherpas and base camp
managers as sources, the site aims for comprehensive coverage of
developments on Everest, including summit attempts, controversies
and, inevitably, deaths.
</P>
<P>
   It is unique among mountaineering sites in making an effort to
keep track of the Sherpas, who are among the strongest climbers
around. And in contrast with the Mountain Zone, the site emphasizes
climbers from outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   News items are gathered from contributors around the globe _
most of whom communicate with one another only through e-mail _ and
translated into English when necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Partly for this reason, Everest News is in need of a more
consistent editorial tone, and the navigation is unwieldy. Getting
access to the site's other features _ a news archive, climber
interviews, book listings _ can be tedious. Still, if looking at
the Mountain Zone is akin to watching sports highlights on
television, reading Everest News is like a leisurely stroll through
the baseball box scores: it's a more complete way to keep track of
the game and sometimes more satisfying, as well. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NOVA ONLINE: LOST ON EVEREST _ THE SEARCH FOR MALLORY AND
IRVINE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/everest &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay stood on top of
Mount Everest, the summit was reached by two other climbers: George
Mallory and Andrew Irvine. That, at least, is what some
mountaineering romantics claim. Mallory _ he's the one who said he
wanted to climb Everest ``because it is there'' _ and his partner
were last seen 1,000 feet from the top while making their 1924
summit bid.
</P>
<P>
   Until now. Seventy-five years later, an American team _ the same
north-side team sending reports to the Mountain Zone _ is trying to
figure out what became of the climbers, and they are filming a
``Nova'' documentary in the process. On Sunday, they reported the
discovery of Mallory's body, and they are promising further
evidence of whether or not he reached the summit.
</P>
<P>
   Even without the news of this discovery, the accompanying PBS
Web site is an excellent introduction to Everest. The team plans to
send a Quick Time movie back from each camp on the route. For those
unfamiliar with the topography of Everest, the Climb section
provides a good virtual tour of the mountain from both sides.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   What most distinguishes the site is the historical background it
provides. The Lost on Everest section has profiles of Mallory and
Irvine, complete with pictures of their equipment, which now looks
astonishingly antiquated and makes their efforts seem even more
impressive, whatever the result. Tweed coats (in which Mallory
first climbed Everest) are nice but not, it must be said, ideal
gear for high-altitude climbing.
</P>
<P>
   This is the third ``Nova'' show to be filmed on Everest in the
last four years, and the current site has integrated considerable
material that was first posted in 1996 and 1997. There are sections
on Sherpa culture, high-altitude physiology and even geology (the
summit of Everest consists of marine limestone).
</P>
<P>
   Lost on Everest contains so much information that I began to
feel lost among all the choices after a while. The site map is
probably the best way to navigate this mountain of information
without forgetting what it was you intended to look at in the first
place. &QL;

<P>
   EVEREST INTERNET EXPERIMENT 1999 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   www.mounteverest.net &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of all the expeditions managing their own Web sites, the most
technologically ambitious is an international team of climbers
conducting what they are calling the Everest Internet Experiment.
This is nothing less than an effort to perform the first-ever live
Webcast from the summit of the mountain, in the form of a video
feed that will be refreshed every five seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to master Everest with technology are frequently
thwarted, but a live video feed was first broadcast from the
summit, the roof of the world, in 1983. The members of this
expedition have been busy setting up relay antennas on the lower
slopes of the mountain in preparation for the big day.
</P>
<P>
   They also hope to provide audio during the Webcast. They say
they have backup plans for the quick release of digital summit
photos if the live feed does not work.
</P>
<P>
   The live Webcast is only one of two stunts this team is hoping
to pull off. A Sherpa climber, Babu Shirri, will try to sleep at
the summit for a night. (Few people have survived a night anywhere
near the top.) The two events are planned for the same night.
</P>
<P>
   The site also has daily dispatches (which are gradually becoming
more anxious in tone) and usually a few new photos every day, as
well as the standard climber biographies. A section on mountain
medicine is somewhat melodramatic about the perils of altitude,
warning, ``You might fall asleep with a slight headache only to
never wake again in the morning.'' Let us hope that description
won't apply to Shirri if he dozes at the summit. &QL;

<P>
   BBC ONLINE: EVEREST ONLINE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   www.bbc.co.uk/england/everest  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are mountaineering stars who keep returning to Mount
Everest on well-financed expeditions, and then there are
lesser-known climbers who just can't get the mountain out of their
systems. The second category includes Graham Ratcliffe, who is
climbing Everest for the fifth time and sending dispatches about it
back to England via the BBC's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual for amateur climbers to return to Everest
several times in an attempt to reach the summit just once, but
Ratcliffe has already successfully visited the summit, in 1995. He
is, however, one of three people trying to become _ get ready for
it _ the first Englishman to reach the summit of Everest from both
the north and south sides. If this distinction seems esoteric,
well, it is.
</P>
<P>
   Ratcliffe comes across as affable in his intermittent updates.
The BBC's site is likewise modest, offering dispatches with some
audio and video, an account of Ratcliffe's previous climbs and the
inevitable briefly sketched climbing history of Everest.
</P>
<P>
   According to the latest update, relations among the dueling
Brits contesting for this honor ``are becoming a little tense at
base camp.'' Ratcliffe allows that ``it is competitive'' there. To
some extent, blame the Web for this. In modern mountaineering, the
stakes are higher than ever for relatively unknown climbers like
Ratcliffe, in a sense, because virtual spectators the world over
can tell how he is doing.
</P>
<P>
   It is a new rite of spring: learning a little about each year's
crop of Everest climbers, cheering on old favorites and either
pulling for or rooting against the lesser-known players in the
drama. I hope Ratcliffe reaches the summit, of course, but why do I
keep checking his site? There can be only one good reason: because
it is there.

IN CASE THINGS GO VERY WRONG, A PARACHUTE FOR THE PLANE ITSELF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds, this story sent and held last week, is now released.)   (af)  
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It works for pilots and passengers, so why not for whole
airplanes? Next month, a company in Duluth, Minn., plans to market
a single-engine plane with a parachute for the plane itself.
</P>
<P>
   The SR-20, from the Cirrus Design Corp., is one of only two new
American designs for single-engine private planes approved by the
Federal Aviation Administration in the past 15 years and will be
the first plane to have a parachute as standard equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The parachute is stowed on the roof; when an occupant pulls an
overhead handle, the parachute is deployed by a rocket that shoots
toward the tail.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how good you are as a pilot,'' said Chris L. Maddy,
a spokesman for the company, ``there are some circumstances, like a
midair collision, or where the pilot becomes incapacitated, or
you're flying over the woods of northern Minnesota at night and you
can't see the runway to land, and you're going to pull the chute.''
</P>
<P>
   Parachutes have already been included in ultralights and hang
gliders. The company that builds parachutes for Cirrus, Ballistic
Recovery Systems of St. Paul, Minn., also designed one as an add-on
for two small Cessnas, but they did not catch on.
</P>
<P>
   Maddy said his company had orders for 272 planes, which cost
$165,000 to $175,000 each _ $10,000 of that for the parachute. But
an owner might recoup some of that cost if insurance companies see
a reduction in claims as a result of the parachute.
</P>
<P>
   The parachute attaches at the plane's center of gravity and thus
can hold it level and give it a steady rate of descent, but using
the parachute would still be an act of desperation. The plane is
likely to be damaged beyond repair by the impact, the company said,
but the occupants will be able to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a bumpy ride and not going to be any fun,''
Maddy said, ``but you're going to walk away from it, most likely.''
The extent of injuries could also depend on whether the plane came
down in a flat spot or in the trees.
</P>
<P>
   Although the parachute is a dramatic feature, the airplane, one
of the few models developed after microchips became commonplace,
also makes heavy use of computers. The cockpit is equipped with
full-color flat-panel computer displays, something found only on
newer jets. These show the function of various aircraft systems and
navigation information, incorporating data from the Global
Positioning System.
</P>
<P>
   The plane has several other innovations intended to make it
simpler to fly. One is a lever that adjusts both the throttle and
the angle at which the propeller blades dig into the air. On most
planes those controls are separate.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cirrus has not had smooth sailing. The first one off the
production line crashed on March 23, killing the pilot, Maj. Scott
Anderson of the Minnesota Air National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who had 1,000 hours of experience in F-16s, may have
had control problems. The accident is still under investigation by
the National Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   The plane Anderson was flying did not have a parachute, which
was not available when it was built.

HASEK: SABRES LONE MAGICIAN IN GOAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ The Sabres encircled the angry buffalo logo at
center ice in Marine Midland Arena Wednesday as they awaited
instructions from their coaches at practice. All except one.
</P>
<P>
   Like an aloof diva, Dominik Hasek left the masses in his wake,
skating deliberately toward his net, deep in contemplation,
concocting who knows what diabolical and illogical schemes of
psychological torture. He did not hear as his boss indirectly
talked about him behind his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``All right,'' said coach Lindy Ruff, ``let's do some
two-on-ones, score a few goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres' chances of boosting their offensive confidence at
their goaltender's expense were about equal to those of the wispy,
5-foot-11-inch, 170-pound Hasek becoming Mr. Universe.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, some 30 in all, a pair of Sabre forwards would
play keepaway from a lone defender and converge on Hasek _ the
classic goalie's nightmare, when the netminder is most vulnerable,
unsure which attacker will strike. At the end of the drill, after
Hasek had done his impressions of a starving seal flopping along
the ice begging for fish, exactly three pucks lay behind him in the
net.
</P>
<P>
   So rare was the occurrence that each time a Sabre converted,
observing teammates would form a chorus of cheers _ part
admiration, part disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I really notice about Dom,'' said veteran defenseman
Darryl Shannon, ``is the effort he puts out in practice. He tries
hard on every guy, gets pissed off when anyone scores, makes it
more of a challenge. It's contagious. Guys try harder. And when
they score, they celebrate.''
</P>
<P>
   And these are his friends.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine what it must be like to confront Hasek in actual battle.
Sane opponents want no part of him _ perhaps because he has used
most of those parts, and some he seems to have invented, to deny
and demoralize them. Whether he's rolling on the ice as if he's
been shot, performing a scissor kick worthy of a synchronized
swimmer, thrusting out a skate as if he were discarding one of his
legs, or flicking his glove hand as if he were playing catch in the
backyard, Hasek stops the puck. True, it's in a manner that ranges
between unorthodox and unimaginable, but it works. Better than any
goalie in the National Hockey League, as a matter of fact. That's
why last season Hasek became the first at his position to win two
straight MVP awards _ which made suitable bookends for the 1998
Olympic gold medal he almost single-handedly seized for his native
Czech Republic _ and why he is being hailed as perhaps the greatest
ever to man a net.
</P>
<P>
   It is also why the Sabres strike fear into any potential playoff
opponent despite their lowly seventh-place ranking in the Eastern
Conference, which was largely due to the fact that Hasek was
sidelined for 13 games with back and groin injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The Ottawa Senators, second overall in the conference and
champions of the Northeast Division, 12 points ahead of neighbor
Buffalo, were the first victims of the Curse of the Dominator this
spring. Ottawa was swept aside by the next-to-last playoff
qualifier mainly through the handiwork of Hasek, who set the tone
for the four-game ouster with a 2-1 victory in the opener, when
Buffalo was outshot, 41-15.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now it's the Bruins who have drawn the joker from the deck,
facing the Sabres in a best-of-seven second-round series that
starts Thursday night in Boston. The Bruins' alternative foe in the
Eastern semifinals would have been Toronto, a team of far more
balance than Buffalo and one that also boasts a goalie who is no
slacker, Curtis Joseph. Yet the prevailing notion is that the
Sabres loom as a tougher obstacle, for one reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Dom factor,'' said Ruff, whose team beat Boston in
four of five meetings during the regular season, three of the wins
with Hasek in goal. ``I don't think anyone wants to face him when
he's on his game. We're not kidding anybody _ Dom's the guy for us.
He's one of the elite players.''
</P>
<P>
   So elite that the company he keeps is historic. ``(Jaromir) Jagr
the way he's playing now,'' said Ruff. ``(Wayne) Gretzky in his
prime. Guys who could dominate, win a game, turn a series. That's
Dom. The first game against Ottawa was an example.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the playoffs, where goaltending is considered paramount,
Hasek's impact is even more fearsome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams come in,'' said Sabres captain Michael Peca, perhaps
hockey's finest defensive forward, ``and see he's the best goalie
in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasek, whose excitement quotient is inversely proportionate to
his excellence, blandly dismisses the accolades, as he does most
things when he's in the public eye: ``I just go on playing hockey
and do the best I can on the ice. I don't care what other people
say about me. We are a very good all-around team.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, without Hasek, the Sabres are a very unimposing team.
They play bottleneck defense (175 goals against, second in the
league) thanks to him but have limited firepower (207 goals, 17th
among 27 NHL teams). And they won't be helped in that area by the
loss at least for the series opener of 40-goal scorer Miroslav
Satan, whose ankle, injured when struck by a shot from teammate
Alexei Zhitnik against Ottawa, hasn't responded during the nine-day
layoff.
</P>
<P>
   Guess who that leaves the focus on.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that Dominik Hasek basically makes that
team,'' said Boston's Byron Dafoe, one of the few goalies who
statistically approached Hasek this season _ and for whom Hasek
voted as a first-team All-Star. ``He can win games single-handedly,
and he has. He has such a presence about him that he can intimidate
a goal scorer. They almost do too much with the puck instead of
just putting a shot on net.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about him,'' added Dafoe, who returned the favor by
putting Hasek on his All-Star ballot, ``is that he's a battler.
He'll stop the puck any way he can. It doesn't always look pretty,
but he doesn't care.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, despite his own claims to the contrary, the maniacally
competitive and ferociously proud Hasek does care how he is
regarded. Universal acceptance has come relatively late in the
34-year-old's NHL career, which almost ended before it started.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A native of Pardubice, he learned about ice hockey on ponds and
goaltending by standing in a doorway at home while his father, Jan,
and an uncle barraged him with tennis balls; perhaps that's why it
often seems he treats the puck as one. To this day, his methods of
honing his game can be, shall we say, unique. During this extended
break between series, Hasek spent a couple of afternoons playing
street hockey with his son and the neighborhood kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, that's not where I get my style,'' he said with a laugh.
``It's something I like to do because it's fun.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a nasty rumor circulating that Hasek had let a kid
score on him, but those who know him insist he would never permit
such perfidy.
</P>
<P>
   In more conventional circles, Hasek had a tougher time fitting
in. A star in the Czech League, he didn't give US hockey a try
until he was 25 _ and he tried to return to his homeland when he
found himself buried in the minors with the Blackhawks. Mike
Keenan, then the Chicago coach, wouldn't grant his release but did
shuffle him off to Buffalo, where, after his first full season, he
was left unprotected in the Anaheim-Florida expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes some goalies longer to mature,'' said Peca. ``When
Dom started, no one knew he was going to be the best goalie in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't acknowledged even after Hasek began dominating in
the NHL. Despite winning three Vezina Trophies as the league's top
goalie in the next four years and becoming the first netminder
since Montreal's Jacques Plante in 1962 to capture the Hart Trophy
as MVP, Hasek was dogged by skepticism that he was merely a
statistical marvel, not a champion.
</P>
<P>
   That notion was reinforced during the 1997 playoffs, most of
which Hasek missed, claiming injury _ then assaulting a Buffalo
writer who suggested in print that the pain was all in his head, a
serious case of excessive pressure. Coupled with the fact that he
led the coup that got popular coach Ted Nolan fired, that caused
Hasek to become perhaps the first MVP ever to be the object of his
hometown fans' wrath when he took the ice at the start of the
following season.
</P>
<P>
   But the boos and the pejoratives vanished after that glorious
fortnight in Nagano, when Hasek led the long-shot Czechs past the
United States, Canada, and Russia in the Olympic medal round. It
was a performance punctuated by perhaps the most legendary shootout
since the O.K. Corral, when Hasek foiled Canada's five deadliest
snipers _ Theo Fleury, Ray Bourque, Joe Nieuwendyk, Eric Lindros,
and Brendan Shanahan _ to give the Czechs a semifinal win.
</P>
<P>
   Laconic as always, Hasek, who became an icon in his homeland,
insists that his exploits in Japan proved nothing to him. ``My
confidence has always been the same,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he does concede that it had a galvanizing effect on his
public image. ``All of a sudden,'' he said, ``I was the goalie who
won the gold medal for the Czech Republic in people's eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Peca also believes that the Olympic impact was more one of
perception than self-discovery. ``I don't think he ever doubted in
his own mind how good he was,'' said Peca. ``I think what the
Olympics did for him was show he could perform against the best
players in the world, that he could beat them. In a lot of people's
eyes, it made him a winner in some sense.''
</P>
<P>
   In an NHL sense, Hasek still has not been the ultimate winner.
Despite another superb season _ a 30-18-4 record, a career-low 1.87
goals-against average, 9 shutouts (one behind league leader Dafoe),
and, for the sixth straight year, the league's highest save
percentage (.937) _ and his virtuoso first-round effort against
Ottawa, Hasek Wednesday faced questions about what his resume
lacks.
</P>
<P>
   He was reminded that for all his brilliance last season, popular
opinion was that he had been outdueled by Washington's Olaf Kolzig
in Buffalo's six-game Stanley Cup semifinal loss. ``It upsets me
any time I lose,'' he said. ``It doesn't matter who the other
goalie is.''
</P>
<P>
   He was advised that his next obstacle is Kolzig's best friend,
Dafoe. ``This is not a duel between the goalies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, for all his inscrutability and quirks and
standoffishness, Hasek's self-demands may be helping his teammates
prepare for Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at practice as an opportunity to find ways to score
against the best goalie in the world,'' said Peca. ``If I can do
that, I figure I can score against the others.''
</P>
<P>
   That's fine with Hasek. But don't dare do it against him,
whether you're ally or enemy.

 MOUNTAIN CLIMBING AS A SPECTATOR SPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Peter Dizikes is a freelance writer and recreational climber who
lives in New York.  
 By PETER DIZIKES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Armchair mountaineering is a time-honored tradition among those
seeking vicarious thrills from the comfort of their own homes. In
the last few years, however, it has been supplemented by a new
occupation: desktop mountaineering, the practice of following a
climbing expedition on the Web as its members try to reach the
summit of one of the world's greatest peaks. And May is the
beginning of peak climbing season.
</P>
<P>
   Mount Everest, for instance, has seen a huge increase in foot
traffic in the 1990s. But record numbers of people have also paid a
virtual visit to Everest, the world's highest mountain, in the last
few years.
</P>
<P>
   Some 20 expeditions (and at least 150 climbers) are trying
Everest this year, and more than a dozen have their own Web sites,
with journal-style dispatches, photos, route maps, audio and video
clips, and thumbnail Everest histories. Far from being a remote
adventure, high-altitude mountaineering is now a spectator sport.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always this way, of course. Sir Edmund Hillary, of New
Zealand, and Tenzing Norgay, a Sherpa guide, were the first
climbers to reach Everest's summit, on May 29, 1953. The news of
the feat, by a British expedition, reached the public on June 2
(the day of Queen Elizabeth's inauguration, by happy coincidence) _
and the news moved that fast only because The London Times had sent
a correspondent, James Morris, to Nepal.
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed: James Morris now writes as Jan Morris, and
when Everest is climbed today, the public knows about it before the
climbers are off the mountain. Climbers radio from the top down to
base camp, where team members call home on satellite phones. Then
expedition Web sites quickly post updates that read like breaking
news, even if there is a little lag time.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the Web, desktop mountaineers now get a taste of the
unfolding anxiety and uncertainty faced by real mountaineers. Take
Carolyn Hahn, a writer living in New York, who, along with other
family members, uses the Web to follow the feats of her brother
Dave, a professional climber who has reached the Everest summit and
sent witty Web dispatches back from the mountain in each of the
last two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only know what's on the Web,'' she said. ``When two climbers
died on his route last year, we got an e-mail saying he was OK But
otherwise, I just read the same updates as everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web would be well suited to accounts of climbing feats even
without this immediacy. Good sites include abundant photographs
(most can be enlarged with a click) and other visual effects,
combining them with text in creative ways to give readers more of
that elusive you-are-there feeling than can be had while curled up
in an armchair with a book or magazine. With so many sites, though,
it may not be clear where to begin. Here are a few ways to make the
mountains come to you. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (italics)``Into Thin Air,'' a book by Jon Krakauer about the
1996 climbing disaster on Mount Everest, spent a long time atop the
best-seller list, and the Imax film ``Everest'' enjoyed a long run
in theaters. If you want to find out more about the disaster, in
which five people died, here are a few Web sites related to it and
to other climbs in 1996:(end italics) &QL;

<P>
   THE MOUNTAIN ZONE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   www.mountainzone.com &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A commercial site with plenty of high-end gadgetry at its
disposal, the Mountain Zone, based in Seattle, has done more than
any other site to move climbing into the virtual world. For
climbing fans, a significant part of the site's attraction is that
it follows the stars of American mountaineering, who are paid to
send in reports as correspondents.
</P>
<P>
   The Mountain Zone is currently providing updates from three
Himalayan expeditions. One team is attempting the unprecedented
triple play of climbing the south side of Everest, then its two
adjoining neighbors, Lhotse (the world's fourth-highest peak) and
Nuptse.
</P>
<P>
   Another group is on the north side of Everest, searching for
evidence of the expedition of George Mallory and Andrew Irvine,
Everest pioneers who did not return from their 1924 climb. On
Sunday, these climbers announced that they had found Mallory's body
and would continue to search for more evidence.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, Ed Viesturs, who is America's best-known climber
and is prominently featured in ``Everest,'' an Imax film, is
closing in on a highly coveted mountaineering prize: scaling all 14
of the world's peaks measuring 8,000 meters (more than 26,000 feet)
or more. With his climb of Dhaulagiri on Tuesday, Viesturs' tally
is at 12.
</P>
<P>
   The dispatches sent back to Seattle by climbers on all three
teams make up the heart of the coverage. These are either progress
reports or, on rest days, a chance for climbers to reflect on their
calling. Pete Athans, the south-side team leader, recently invoked
T.S. Eliot's poetry to describe his awe of Everest _ ``the object
of all our exploring is to arrive at the beginning and know the
place for the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Many dispatches are transcripts of satellite phone or radio
calls from base camp and above. I listen to these using the Windows
Media Player, although Real Playeralso works. Most have been casual
briefings from lower elevations on Everest, but when Viesturs
climbed Dhaulagiri Tuesday, he radioed down an hour later, in a
voice strained with fatigue. The recent dispatches about Mallory's
body are also available as audio clips.
</P>
<P>
   The most spectacular parts of the Mountain Zone's Everest
coverage are its video clips and 360-degree photos. The former
(which require Real Player) include an airplane fly-by of Everest.
Even better are the photos posted by the south-siders. The images
automatically pan like video clips when loaded, but they can be
controlled by mouse, and it is possible to zoom in (although much
sharpness is lost).
</P>
<P>
   The 360-degree photo from Camp 1, with Everest, Lhotse and
Nuptse looming overhead, is by itself worth a trip to the site. My
favorite shows the Thyangboche monastery on the trek in: animals
graze serenely with Everest visible in the distance. To find the
images, go to the south-side dispatches, then click on the Features
and Multimedia links.
</P>
<P>
   The Mountain Zone is, however, unabashedly commercial.
Advertisements line the site, and an Everest Store sells all manner
of memorabilia. So far I have resisted buying replica Sherpa prayer
flags for $29.95; my visits feel authentic enough already. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EVEREST NEWS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   www.everestnews.com  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With a homespun feel and few visual offerings, Everest News is
the antithesis of the Mountain Zone. Nonetheless, it has also
become a virtual base camp for desktop mountaineers. The site
provides two attractive services: news updates from Everest and
other major peaks, posted a few times a day during the spring and
summer, and links to the Web sites of nearly every major
expedition.
</P>
<P>
   Using an impressive network of climbers, Sherpas and base camp
managers as sources, the site aims for comprehensive coverage of
developments on Everest, including summit attempts, controversies
and, inevitably, deaths.
</P>
<P>
   It is unique among mountaineering sites in making an effort to
keep track of the Sherpas, who are among the strongest climbers
around. And in contrast with the Mountain Zone, the site emphasizes
climbers from outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   News items are gathered from contributors around the globe _
most of whom communicate with one another only through e-mail _ and
translated into English when necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Partly for this reason, Everest News is in need of a more
consistent editorial tone, and the navigation is unwieldy. Getting
access to the site's other features _ a news archive, climber
interviews, book listings _ can be tedious. Still, if looking at
the Mountain Zone is akin to watching sports highlights on
television, reading Everest News is like a leisurely stroll through
the baseball box scores: it's a more complete way to keep track of
the game and sometimes more satisfying, as well. &QL; 
 &QL;

<P>
   NOVA ONLINE: LOST ON EVEREST _ THE SEARCH FOR MALLORY AND
IRVINE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/everest &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay stood on top of
Mount Everest, the summit was reached by two other climbers: George
Mallory and Andrew Irvine. That, at least, is what some
mountaineering romantics claim. Mallory _ he's the one who said he
wanted to climb Everest ``because it is there'' _ and his partner
were last seen 1,000 feet from the top while making their 1924
summit bid.
</P>
<P>
   Until now. Seventy-five years later, an American team _ the same
north-side team sending reports to the Mountain Zone _ is trying to
figure out what became of the climbers, and they are filming a
``Nova'' documentary in the process. On Sunday, they reported the
discovery of Mallory's body, and they are promising further
evidence of whether or not he reached the summit.
</P>
<P>
   Even without the news of this discovery, the accompanying PBS
Web site is an excellent introduction to Everest. The team plans to
send a Quick Time movie back from each camp on the route. For those
unfamiliar with the topography of Everest, the Climb section
provides a good virtual tour of the mountain from both sides.

   Who are the most-desired and inspiring men in the fields of
sports, entertainment, politics and the arts? See if you agree with
the coveted picks below:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION: DYLAN McDERMOTT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, about a decade ago, Dylan McDermott had all
the trappings of soon-to-be movie stardom a young 80s hunk could
hope for: coveted roles in big-budget movies, an open door to the
Brat Pack's Hollywood parties and an engagement to ingenue-du-jour
Julia Roberts, just after they starred in ``Steel Magnolias''
together and her career took off.
</P>
<P>
   But a funny thing happened: His didn't. Julia moved on to Kiefer
Sutherland _ and superstardom _ and McDermott moved on to less
flashy women _ and humdrum roles.
</P>
<P>
   Well, what a difference a decade can make. Today, on a
television studio lot in Manhattan Beach, the 36-year-old actor has
all the trappings a 90s just-made-it TV star could hope for: a trip
to the Super Bowl on the Fox private jet and a brand new black
Jaguar delivered, VIP-style, to the set to ``The Practice.''
</P>
<P>
   In his dressing room sits a silver-framed shot of him winning
his first Golden Globe this year for Best Actor in a TV Drama, sent
by way of congratulations by Paramount's Sherry Lansing. And at
home in Santa Monica, his beautiful actress wife, Shiva Rose Afshar
and two-year-old daughter, Colette, are making Daddy a great
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott discusses the ups and downs of his career as casually
as if it were someone else's. ``You know why I didn't become a
movie star the first go-round?'' he asks. ``Because I wasn't ready
to be a movie star _ I wasn't really a man yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The role of idealistic, struggling Boston lawyer Bobby Donnell
on ``The Practice'' seems tailor-made for McDermott, finally
showing off his earnestness and intensity _ and leading-man square
jaw and blue eyes. ``Bobby was originally meant to be schlubbier,
less stylish, not too attractive.'' he says. ``But I told them that
even as a Boston criminal attorney, he could buy nice clothes at an
outlet store, and they let me do it.''
</P>
<P>
   McDermott may have been a self-described nerd in high school but
he now gets regular mention as one of Hollywood's best-dressed
actors. ``I think it's because I'm from New York,'' he say, ``and
it is the fashion capital of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PERFORMING ARTS: MIKHAIL BARYSHNIKOV &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Mikhail Baryshnikov arrived in the U.S in 1973, he quickly
learned to fuse his classical Russian training with a free-form
pursuit of more experimental, Western modes of dance. Now a
50-year-old U.S. citizen, Baryshnikov still embodies the best of
both worlds: He's a ferociously disciplined dancer and leader of
the White Oak dance troupe, but he's not opposed to tossing back
some vodka and sounding off about the problems of the world.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MEDIA: MATT LAUER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only recently one of New York's most eligible bachelors,
``Today'' show cohost Matt Lauer, who married Dutch model Annette
Roque in October, is still the man that American women most want to
see across the breakfast table. Generally considered a welcome
relief from the irascible and egocentric Bryant Gumbel (a close
friend and the best man at his wedding), Lauer plies his trade with
a combination of good looks, even temperament and just the right
degree of friendly seriousness required for 8 a.m. His fashion
claim to fame _ dark dress shirts with matching ties _ brought a
runway trend to the streets so quickly that even he had to abandon
it lest he look too, well, Matt Lauer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART: DAVID HOCKNEY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If David Hockney is one of the world's most popular living
painters, it's not just because his work _ with its emphasis on
luminous colors and inviting spaces _ is so pleasing to the eye.
Hockney is also a genuine charmer who has never felt the need to
play the tortured artiste. Still youthful and sprightly at age 60,
the British expat remains enamored with his adopted country _ an
enthusiasm that shows in his work, whether he's painting his two
basset hounds or the Grand Canyon itself.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BUSINESS: TED TURNER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He's loud, abrasive and obnoxious, but in many ways, Ted Turner
is the consummate American businessman. The merger of Turner
Broadcasting with Time Warner in 1996 put him near the center of
power in the country's biggest media conglomerate, but he hasn't
stopped there.
</P>
<P>
   In politics and the environment, he has put his considerable
money where his even more considerable mouth is; even the U.S.
government often pales by comparison. While Turner has pledged a
billion dollars to the United Nations, Congress dithers over paying
its international dues. And while the Senate might ponder whether
to buy a 95,000-acre ranch in the middle of the Santa Fe National
Forest, Turner had already snapped up nearly a million acres in New
Mexico for preservation. ``He is the most important American on the
conservation front since Teddy Roosevelt,'' says NBC anchor Tom
Brokaw, who calls Turner ``a mogul of the highest order.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ROYALTY: JOHN F KENNEDY JR. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was unwise of us to put him on the ballot alongside
Prince Charles and Albert of Monaco, but ``George'' magazine editor
in chief John F. Kennedy Jr., received more votes than any other
nominee in any category. Of course, there is his pedigree, which is
impeccable. And you certainly have to agree that he married well.
</P>
<P>
   He also continues to manage a good deal of finesse under the
enormous public scrutiny that comes from being JFK's son: the nasty
tabloid headlines when he flunked his bar exam, his lovers' spats
documented with high-powered lenses, the near hysteria surrounding
his mother's death. But just because he looks better in an evening
suit, is that any reason to pick him over the Dalai Lama?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MUSIC: LENNY KRAVITZ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although music critics aren't always thrilled with Lenny
Kravitz's derivative brand of 70s-style funk/rock, few would deny
that he looks good in bell-bottoms. Last year, Kravitz released his
fifth album, began his world tour and cut off his famous
dreadlocks. The rocker is also planning a film appearance. Not to
worry, though. He may go Hollywood and he may be shorn, but the
tattoos, the piercings and leather get-ups remain.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM: HARRISON FORD &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The David Carusos and Ryan Philippes of the world may come and
go, but Harrison Ford _ now in the fourth decade of his career _ is
definitely built to last. The former carpenter's rugged,
regular-guy appeal has helped him become this century's most
dependable action hero: His movies have pulled in an astonishing $2
billion worldwide. As for his unstudied sense of style _ part
Marlboro Man, part soccer dad-well, ``it's match-the-hatch,'' Ford
says. ``That's a fly fishing term. You try to present the fish with
something that looks most like its natural food. I try to dress for
the circumstance. Think of it as protective coloration.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SPORTS: TIGER WOODS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Number one-ranked Tiger Woods, who turned the golf world on its
ear in 1997 when he won the Masters at the age of 21 by a
record-setting 12 strokes, has had a tough act to follow: his own.
Yet he has managed to hold his trademark smile and graciousness
through a string of frustrating near-misses in the past year.
Unlike many pro athletes, Woods has taken on the mantle of role
model willingly and responsibly. This year, his Tiger Woods
Foundation will conduct four golf clinics around the country for
inner-city youths during which Woods himself will help out with the
lessons.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POLITICS: TONY BLAIR &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tony Blair stands in stark contrast to past British prime
ministers, not to mention most of the gray men of British politics.
First, there are his boyish looks at 46 (which he turns next
month). Then, there's his meet-the-people style, an M.O. that's far
more Clintonian than Churchillian. Blair may wear the same classic
British suits as his predecessor John Major, but the cut is more
Savile Row than Marks &AMP; Spencer. While on vacation, the
American-admiring Blair favors jeans the staple of his youth as
lead guitarist in the rock band Ugly Rumours.  &QL;   &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   What most distinguishes the site is the historical background it
provides. The Lost on Everest section has profiles of Mallory and
Irvine, complete with pictures of their equipment, which now looks
astonishingly antiquated and makes their efforts seem even more
impressive, whatever the result. Tweed coats (in which Mallory
first climbed Everest) are nice but not, it must be said, ideal
gear for high-altitude climbing.
</P>
<P>
   This is the third ``Nova'' show to be filmed on Everest in the
last four years, and the current site has integrated considerable
material that was first posted in 1996 and 1997. There are sections
on Sherpa culture, high-altitude physiology and even geology (the
summit of Everest consists of marine limestone).
</P>
<P>
   Lost on Everest contains so much information that I began to
feel lost among all the choices after a while. The site map is
probably the best way to navigate this mountain of information
without forgetting what it was you intended to look at in the first
place. &QL;

<P>
   EVEREST INTERNET EXPERIMENT 1999 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   www.mounteverest.net &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of all the expeditions managing their own Web sites, the most
technologically ambitious is an international team of climbers
conducting what they are calling the Everest Internet Experiment.
This is nothing less than an effort to perform the first-ever live
Webcast from the summit of the mountain, in the form of a video
feed that will be refreshed every five seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to master Everest with technology are frequently
thwarted, but a live video feed was first broadcast from the
summit, the roof of the world, in 1983. The members of this
expedition have been busy setting up relay antennas on the lower
slopes of the mountain in preparation for the big day.
</P>
<P>
   They also hope to provide audio during the Webcast. They say
they have backup plans for the quick release of digital summit
photos if the live feed does not work.
</P>
<P>
   The live Webcast is only one of two stunts this team is hoping
to pull off. A Sherpa climber, Babu Shirri, will try to sleep at
the summit for a night. (Few people have survived a night anywhere
near the top.) The two events are planned for the same night.
</P>
<P>
   The site also has daily dispatches (which are gradually becoming
more anxious in tone) and usually a few new photos every day, as
well as the standard climber biographies. A section on mountain
medicine is somewhat melodramatic about the perils of altitude,
warning, ``You might fall asleep with a slight headache only to
never wake again in the morning.'' Let us hope that description
won't apply to Shirri if he dozes at the summit. &QL; 
 &QL;

   BBC ONLINE: EVEREST ONLINE &QL;

</P>
<P>
   There are mountaineering stars who keep returning to Mount
Everest on well-financed expeditions, and then there are
lesser-known climbers who just can't get the mountain out of their
systems. The second category includes Graham Ratcliffe, who is
climbing Everest for the fifth time and sending dispatches about it
back to England via the BBC's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual for amateur climbers to return to Everest
several times in an attempt to reach the summit just once, but
Ratcliffe has already successfully visited the summit, in 1995. He
is, however, one of three people trying to become _ get ready for
it _ the first Englishman to reach the summit of Everest from both
the north and south sides. If this distinction seems esoteric,
well, it is.
</P>
<P>
   Ratcliffe comes across as affable in his intermittent updates.
The BBC's site is likewise modest, offering dispatches with some
audio and video, an account of Ratcliffe's previous climbs and the
inevitable briefly sketched climbing history of Everest.
</P>
<P>
   According to the latest update, relations among the dueling
Brits contesting for this honor ``are becoming a little tense at
base camp.'' Ratcliffe allows that ``it is competitive'' there. To
some extent, blame the Web for this. In modern mountaineering, the
stakes are higher than ever for relatively unknown climbers like
Ratcliffe, in a sense, because virtual spectators the world over
can tell how he is doing.
</P>
<P>
   It is a new rite of spring: learning a little about each year's
crop of Everest climbers, cheering on old favorites and either
pulling for or rooting against the lesser-known players in the
drama. I hope Ratcliffe reaches the summit, of course, but why do I
keep checking his site? There can be only one good reason: because
it is there.

   Who are the most-desired and inspiring men in the fields of
sports, entertainment, politics and the arts? See if you agree with
the coveted picks below:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION: DYLAN McDERMOTT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, about a decade ago, Dylan McDermott had all
the trappings of soon-to-be movie stardom a young 80s hunk could
hope for: coveted roles in big-budget movies, an open door to the
Brat Pack's Hollywood parties and an engagement to ingenue-du-jour
Julia Roberts, just after they starred in ``Steel Magnolias''
together and her career took off.
</P>
<P>
   But a funny thing happened: His didn't. Julia moved on to Kiefer
Sutherland _ and superstardom _ and McDermott moved on to less
flashy women _ and humdrum roles.
</P>
<P>
   Well, what a difference a decade can make. Today, on a
television studio lot in Manhattan Beach, the 36-year-old actor has
all the trappings a 90s just-made-it TV star could hope for: a trip
to the Super Bowl on the Fox private jet and a brand new black
Jaguar delivered, VIP-style, to the set to ``The Practice.''
</P>
<P>
   In his dressing room sits a silver-framed shot of him winning
his first Golden Globe this year for Best Actor in a TV Drama, sent
by way of congratulations by Paramount's Sherry Lansing. And at
home in Santa Monica, his beautiful actress wife, Shiva Rose Afshar
and two-year-old daughter, Colette, are making Daddy a great

as if it were someone else's. ``You know why I didn't become a

SENATORS ACCUSE RENO OF NOT ENFORCING FEDERAL GUN LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the wake of the Littleton, Colo., high school
massacre, several Republican senators on Wednesday accused Attorney
General Janet Reno of failing to fully enforce federal gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Federal gun laws are not worth much unless the Justice
Department enforces them,'' Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of
the Senate Judiciary Committee, told Reno during an hearing on the
department's operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that irritates us, to be honest, is that there are
all these calls for new gun laws by the president but very little
enforcement of the laws we have,'' Hatch said.
</P>
<P>
   Another committee member, Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., called the
administration's prosecution record on gun laws a ``failure.''
Joining Hatch and Sessions in their criticism were Republican Sens.
Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and Bob Smith of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   According to Justice Department statistics, more than 6,000
students illegally brought guns to school last year, but only eight
were prosecuted under federal law.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, federal prosecutions of defendants who used a
firearm during a felony dropped nearly 47 percent, from 7,048 to
3,765, between 1992 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But Reno defended her record, saying the bulk of the 6,000
students were prosecuted under state and local law, rather than
federal law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't do things based on numbers but on who can do the job
best,'' she told the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, a former district attorney for Dade County, Fla., said she
prefers to let state and local authorities handle cases unless they
ask for federal help. ``When I was (a prosecutor) down in Miami, I
often felt that the best way the federal attorneys could help was
in staying out of the way,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials said later that while federal
prosecutions of gun law violations dropped by about 27 percent from
1992 to 1997 _ from around 5,500 to 4,000 _ combined state and
federal prosecutions of those crimes jumped 33 percent in the same
period _ from about 30,000 to 40,000.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, they said, the number of those convicted who went
to prison for state and federal weapons offenses rose nearly 21
percent between 1992 and 1997, from 20,681 to 25,186.
</P>
<P>
   Reno also refused to back a juvenile crime bill sponsored by
Hatch and Sessions. The bill would provide nearly $1 billion in
federal grants for youth detention centers, drug testing of minors
and improved record keeping of juvenile crime. The bill also would
make it illegal for a person who committed a violent felony as a
juvenile to ever own a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said she supports parts of the bill but would like it to
focus more on the prevention of crime through after-school programs
and mentoring programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It costs a lot less to prevent a crime in the first place than
it does to lock somebody up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sessions agreed that preventive programs are needed to help
fight crime. But he said initiatives such as after-school programs
should be included in education bills, not crime legislation. ``We
can't put everything into a crime bill,'' he said.

   RAMSTEIN, Germany _ At a simple pine table in a cavernous army
barracks, the card game is spades and the mood is sheer boredom.
</P>
<P>
   Four camo-clad American soldiers deal a new hand. On the couches
nearby, others watch a movie on a wide-screen TV. Some stretch out,
trying to catch a nap on several of the 600 olive-green cots spread
across the vast room. Another crouches near his field pack,
applying some jet-black polish to the tips of his combat boots.
</P>
<P>
   They are support troops, firefighters, engineers and military
police. They have been waiting days now for their transport plane
to be loaded with cargo and whisk them to Tirana, Albania, a place
few of them had heard of a few years, or even months, ago.
</P>
<P>
   If war is hell, these servicemen are certain that this obscure
corner of America's massive military complex in southwestern
Germany is purgatory.
</P>
<P>
   There was no presidential appearance at this altogether
unphotogenic place, a waystation for American troops headed to the
Balkans with all the charm of a bus terminal.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton came to Germany on Wednesday to visit two U.S.
bases, boost troop morale and maintain public support for the war
against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   As he met at Ramstein Air Base with combat pilots and with the
three POWs released Sunday from Yugoslavia, the two dozen soldiers
here awaited their turn to join the growing NATO combat forces in
the region.
</P>
<P>
   They were preceded by some 4,200 American soldiers who before
flying to Albania spent a few hours or days at the Army's
warehouse-like deployment center at Kaiserslautern, a mammoth
complex of storage facilities, barracks and support facilities
adjacent to Ramstein Air Base.
</P>
<P>
   The young servicemen were oblivious to Clinton's attendance at
the airfield just a mile or so away. Some of them hadn't seen a
newspaper or TV since they left their base in the United States
last week and didn't even know the commander-in-chief was in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   But speeches aren't necessary here among the twenty-somethings
with M-16s; a sense of mission is.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready. We want to go. We want to do our job. We've been
waiting and it's like, when do we get our chance?'' said Army Spec.
Brandon Couch, 22, of Anderson, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   The best morale-boost possible, they said, would be to achieve
the goal of curbing the forces of Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic and allowing innocent refugees to return to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Air war alone? A ground invasion? Leave it to Clinton and the
commanders to worry over how, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is any philosophizing here, it is: Let's get in there
and get the job done so we can get home,'' said Capt. Terry Jarvis,
an army chaplain from Atmore, Ala., who counsels the soldiers
passing through the deployment center.
</P>
<P>
   The foursome playing cards are firefighters who will spend their
little piece of the war protecting the Apache attack helicopters
and pilots who may need to make emergency landings at the Rinas Air
Field near Tirana.
</P>
<P>
   For all, it is their first duty in a potential combat zone.
Their casual chatter on Wednesday was of the assignment to come,
and the much-discussed ground war that could be.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wants it to have to happen, but if it does we'll prove
we can do the job.'' said Spec. Brandon LaBonte, 22, of Olympia,
Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Their sergeant, a veteran of the Persian Gulf War, listened
appreciatively to the bravado of his young subordinates, but
suggested that today's boredom could end all too soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any of them expect the magnitude of this,'' said
Sgt. Michael Hudgins, 41, a native of Ringgold, Ga. ``I don't think
anybody was ready for how hot this is.''

TURNING AWAY FROM VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Tuesday, May 11)  
(mk) 
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The other night I got home in time for the last scene in ``Scent
of a Woman,'' where Al Pacino teaches a roomful of rich snots how
to be a hero, and I sat right down and cried. I've seen that movie
three times and it always gets to me, which I'm sure was Pacino's
intention as well as the filmmaker`s.
</P>
<P>
   Good films are supposed to do that. Same with great books,
paintings, certain songs, lines of poetry, TV specials, opera
arias, even newspaper stories. Anything with words and/or pictures
has the potential to play with your mind. Create incredible
longing, trigger a memory, make you laugh. Images can move you to
action, make you miss your father, inspire you to move to Maine and
to switch bathroom cleansers.
</P>
<P>
   We recognize the power of the media, by which I mean any high
and low art form of communication. As consumers we're easily
stimulated, motivated and, sure, often manipulated by what we see
and hear.
</P>
<P>
   So don't try to tell us it's different when it comes to brutal
and violent images.
</P>
<P>
   We may be suggestible but we're not stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Producers of Hollywood carnage and makers of video games that
invite you to stalk and kill, blow up Chicago if you want, claim no
responsibility for what could have been in the heads of the
suspects in school massacres like the one in Littleton.
</P>
<P>
   Typical cowards, every time there's a horribly vicious crime and
talk turns to motivation, the blood and gore media run and hide
under a rock.
</P>
<P>
   We can't be responsible, they say, for who watches us.
</P>
<P>
   Come on. They have marketing experts and focus groups like
everyone else. They know exactly who's watching and they're a lot
of impressionable young kids mesmerized by killing games.
</P>
<P>
   You don't find personal training in how to be mean and nasty on
the side of cereal boxes. But there's at least a murder a night on
television. Leonardo DiCaprio, America's heartthrob, is in a movie
wearing a trench coat and shooting up a school. And video games
come complete with convincing screams and moans to make the
player's ``victims'' seem more real.
</P>
<P>
   And we, who say we are horrified, let it happen, acting almost
as detached as the media. A blood bath occurs and someone opines on
our ``culture of violence,'' and we agree as if there's nothing we
can do about it.
</P>
<P>
   Why do we have to be a culture of violence? It's our culture. We
can change it.
</P>
<P>
   If we wanted to we could become a culture of beauty. Or a
culture of wonder and reverence.
</P>
<P>
   We've got kids staring at video games with the same kind of
images they show U.S. Marines to get them desensitized to killing.
</P>
<P>
   Why are we desensitizing kids?
</P>
<P>
   One morning I drove by two little boys who were bent over,
peering into the grass. I suspect it was a caterpillar or a garter
snake. Kids are so easily fascinated with things that adults grow
up and get bored with. I thought about the first time I saw a
speeded-up photographic image of a caterpillar coming out of a
cocoon and turning into a butterfly. It was more convincing than
science class and it was on television.
</P>
<P>
   With all its talent and technology the media can contribute
intelligence, understanding and grace. The media taught us about
AIDS and compassion for people with the disease. Moviemaker Steven
Spielberg showed us the ludicrous waste of war. Poets point out our
daily miracles.
</P>
<P>
   We don't have to put up with a culture of violence. We can
boycott slasher movies, turn the TV to the nature channel and start
monitoring computer games. We in the newspaper industry will have
to rethink front page violence. None of this will wreck anyone's
business. The media adapt almost instantly to popular taste.
</P>
<P>
   The media have to take responsibility for creating nightmares
along with dreams. Otherwise, another monster is set to pounce in
the form of censorship ``for the public good'' and that would be as
deadening a trend as school shootings.

``Luxury'' &QL; 
Fantastic Plastic Machine &QL; 
(Emperor Norton) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To get an idea of the vibe Fantastic Plastic Machine sets forth
on Luxury, just scan the song titles: ``Mr. Fantasy's Love,''
``Satellite Beats,'' ``He Became a Beatnik,'' `` Bossa for
Jackie.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the sound of yesterday's tomorrows, as enjoyably chichi as
the very 1970 orange and purple op art on the disc's cover.
</P>
<P>
   Along with such artists as Cornelius, Buffalo Daughter and
Pizzicato Five, Fantastic Plastic Machine (a k a Tokyo deejay
Tomoyuki Tanaka) is part of the Japanese club pop scene known as
Shibuya-ku. This party-ready sound combines elements of '60s easy
listening, '70s funk and soul, and '90s techno into a heady,
kitsch-filled blend.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, Shibuya-ku is not recommended for those who
like their music tastefully subtle _ if anything, it's a genre that
is hyper-aware of its own in-your-face cuteness.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Tanaka has the talent to make ``Luxury'' light and
appealing, whether he's wigging out on the sexy robot fantasy
``Electric Lady Land'' (no relation to Jimi Hendrix) or retooling
the Eurythmics' ``There Must Be an Angel (Playing With My Heart)''
into a lush, nine-minute suite that's more Brazil '66 than London
'85.

 &QL; 
``Ashes of Old Love'' &QL; 
Stacy Dean Campbell &QL; 
(Paladin Records) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The characters that populate the songs on Stacy Dean Campbell's
third album are desperate and haunted, full of insecurities and
fears that seem to literally jump out from the stereo speakers. The
vivid imagery and American gothic musical backdrop make for a
brooding, evocative piece of work that is quietly brilliant, a
journey through the stark back roads of society.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell recorded two fine-but-overlooked discs for Sony, which
marketed the New Mexico native as a twangy, hunky alternative to
Chris Isaak. After dropping out of the scene for a couple of years,
he resurfaces with a matured writing style and a lonesome, rootsy
sound that's as vast and breathtaking as an Oklahoma landscape.
</P>
<P>
   He has penned much of the material himself, revealing a
novelist's eye for detail. There's the pathetic loser threatened by
his woman's potential suitor in the unsettling ``One False Move.''
In ``Makin' Good Time,'' he's a weary road traveler, heading for an
unknown destination accompanied by his lady and a ``dashboard Jesus
chaperone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ashes of Old Love'' has the richness and potency of a Lyle
Lovett disc, but without the biting irony. Campbell is not quite so
cool; instead, he's willing to wear his heart _ and his flaws _ on
his sleeve. And he's blessed with a voice as pure and vulnerable as
a teenage choirboy, which adds an extra layer of pathos and depth
to the proceedings. This is the kind of album that stays with a
listener long after it has left the CD player. &QL;

 &QL; 
``Duo'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Charlie Hunter &AMP; Leon Parker &QL; 
(Blue Note) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the title sounds a bit too minimalist for your taste, relax.
Charlie Hunter's custom eight-string serves as lead, bass and
rhythm guitar _ and, occasionally, electric organ. Add Leon
Parker's intricate percussion, and ``Duo'' has plenty of sound to
hold a jazz fan's attention.
</P>
<P>
   This is a relaxed set, not as funky-fiery as Hunter's past
efforts or as stylistically adventurous as Parker's ``Above &AMP;
Below.''
</P>
<P>
   Subtlety is the name of the game as Charlie delivers shimmering,
lyrical, sometimes bluesy guitar leads while his latest
collaborator proves that a master drummer needn't indulge in
bombastic displays of technical brilliance to prove his chops.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter takes on most of the composing duties here, from the
hypnotic ``Do That Then'' to the playfully bouncy ``Recess'' to the
up-tempo but still laid-back ``Calypso for Grampa.''
</P>
<P>
   He also continues his tradition of making other songwriters'
tunes his own without exorcising the spirit of the original _
witness his dark, vibrant take on the jazz standard ``You Don't
Know What Love Is'' or his echoing, sweetly sad rendition of the
Beach Boys' ``Don't Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder).'' Even
Parker's one contribution, ``Belief,'' still bears Charlie's
melodic stamp while showc asing the drummer's delightfully devious
rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   It's all good stuff. Turn it down as a friendly mood-setter for
conversation or turn it up to immerse yourself in a mellow,
mind-pleasing groove. - Kerry S. Lengel &QL; 
 &QL; 
POP &QL; 
``By 7:30'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Vonda Shepard &QL; 
(Jacket Records) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Who's the most annoying character on the TV show ``Ally
McBeal''? Is it neurotic poster gal Ally? The Biscuit? The
not-very-sexy sexy secretary? How about the wattle guy? Nope, the
worst of the bunch is definitely Vonda Shepard.
</P>
<P>
   Her musical patter is designed to help the viewer connect with
the show's emotional zing. If Ally is in a daze about some love
dilemma (gee, that just about describes every single episode), then
Shepard is trotted out to careen through a verse and a chorus of
some moldy hit. Too bad the singer makes every song sound the same.
She's a vocalist completely void of nuance and insight.
</P>
<P>
   And things don't improve on her latest album. ``By 7:30'' is a
collection of morose and charmless songs. Instead of butchering
Motown hits like she does on TV, Shepard's got her very own songs
to destroy. She dabbles in introspective ennui but doesn't have the
subtlety to carry it off. ``My words are like confetti,'' she sings
at one point. If only this were true. Most of her lyrics are as
broad and heavy-handed as her singing.
</P>
<P>
   The album isn't totally a bust, however. Two songs miraculously
survive the Shepard treatment. ``Baby, Don't You Break My Heart
Slow'' is saved by a guest appearance by the Indigo Girls' Emily
Saliers. And the best song,`` Newspaper Wife,'' sounds like the
music was transfered to disc completely backward. It may sound
kooky, but it works.
</P>
<P>
   Other than these two flukes, Vonda Shepard is as grating on CD
as she is on TV. And ``By 7:30'' is an album that never should have
made it onto prime time. &QL;

BLUES &QL; 
``Houndog'' &QL; 
Houndog &QL; 
Columbia/Legacy) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A sticker on the front calls ``Houndog'' ``a bluesy, trippy
amalgamation of riffs, rites and spirits.'' If the spirits are of
the alcoholic sort and the rites related to self-sacrifice, I'll
buy that line.
</P>
<P>
   Houndog is the duo of blues singer Mike Halby (John Mayall's
Bluesbreakers, Canned Heat) and Los Lobos multi-instrumentalist
David Hidalgo. The music isn't just ``bluesy'' _ it's a tour de
force of roots-blues revivalism. Trippy? Perhaps. Recorded in
Halby's home studio with Hidalgo as producer, the album has the
same spare quality and gritty lo-fi haze you hear from the Latin
Playboys (a Los Lobos side project), and Halby's voice is so low
and slow that you sometimes wonder if the entire recording has been
slowed down a notch or two. But trippy or not, the allure of
``Houndog'' is its good old-fashioned blues riffs, Hidalgo's smoky
guitar work and Halby's tragicomically houndlike vocals.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yeah, he's got the blues. ``I'll be the dog / That digs your
grave / . . .Romance me down, down, down / I'll die your slave,''
he sings on the opening track, ``No Chance.'' (According to a press
release, Bonnie Raitt's reaction to the disc was, ``This is great!
But is he gonna be all right?'') Yet it would be a mistake to
dismiss this album as parody. ``Somebody (Stop the Bleedin')'' has
concerns of greater import than just another broken heart, while
the dark but lilting music of ``I Brought the Rain'' brings the
melancholy lyrics to life, giving them emotional depth and reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Houndog'' may never be a blockbuster, but it certainly is a
heartbreaker. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Shane Minor would be an interesting guy to sit around and shoot
the bull with. He worked as a uniformed police officer in the Watts
area of Los Angeles and even did stints as a rodeo bull rider.
</P>
<P>
   For a man who obviously has some rich life experiences to draw
from, he instead goes for the lowest common denominator on his
self-titled debut album, an unappetizing slab of commercial country
music at its most empty-headed.
</P>
<P>
   The up-tempo songs are nonsensical, butt-wiggling fare, the kind
of thing that Billy Ray Cyrus outgrew years ago. Minor doesn't have
better luck with the ballads, either. They are treacly moaners full
of greeting-card sentimentality. ``How Many Times'' is even written
by shlockmeister supreme Michael Bolton, not exactly a top
Nashville tunesmith.
</P>
<P>
   The sad thing about the whole affair is Minor actually has an
agreeable singing voice. You get the feeling there's a real person
trying to get out from under all the leering whoops and hollers.
He's probably got a lot of great stories in him; instead, all we
can tell from this disc is that he's a vocal cipher who has a thing
for leather pants. _Randy Cordova &QL;

BOOK TALK: THIN SKINS AND THICK 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is improbable fantasy to suppose that authors and publishers
wouldn't do nearly anything to sell their books, so it's hardly
surprising that Frank McCourt took the opportunity to do a
television commercial for Barnes &AMP; Noble's online bookselling
operation and plug not only the chain but his best-selling
``Angela's Ashes'' as well.
</P>
<P>
   But to independent booksellers, it was as if the writer were
feeding bananas to an orangutan or trying to buy off the
neighborhood bully with candy. And although they certainly didn't
intend it, by the time the American Booksellers Association, their
trade organization, ended its convention in Tarrytown, N.Y., on
Sunday, most of the publicity it had generated was over its
melancholy fight with McCourt. Some of the independents felt he
betrayed them by making the ad.
</P>
<P>
   The writer, making no apology, said: ``They should be dealing
with literacy, devoting themselves to nurturing future readers.
What good does it do to hound me? I'm not in the mood for my
crucifixion.''
</P>
<P>
   McCourt added that he was finished with the matter. Anyway, he
would have done a television commercial for the independent stores
had they suggested it, he said, explaining that he did the
commercial only because his publisher, Scribner, wanted him to.
``Last year I gave a reading at a bookstore in Tarrytown and
apparently insulted Barnes &AMP; Noble, and my publisher asked me to
write a letter of apology to the head,'' chief executive officer
Leonard Riggio, ``and I did.''
</P>
<P>
   McCourt said: ``I'm for the little guy. I buy at the local deli
and grocery store. I'm for the booksellers. I'm walking down
Broadway and they're selling David Halberstam's book for $10 on a
street stand. But I can't do that in good conscience, so I went
into a bookstore and bought it.'' The list price of ``Playing for
Keeps'' (Random House) is $24.95.
</P>
<P>
   McCourt was one of four writers to do the barnesandnoble.com (or
www.bn.com) commercial. The others were Stephen King, Tom Clancy
and Scott Adams, the cartoonist who created Dilbert. But only
McCourt caused a flap, because in 1997 he won the independents'
Abby Award, as the author they most liked to sell in their stores,
and at the time of the award he gave a great deal of credit to the
independents for the book's success. Resolutions to censure McCourt
failed by large margins at the convention, which the author
attended.
</P>
<P>
   In the ad, McCourt sits at a desk trying to write his next book
while talking about ``Angela's Ashes,'' his memoir of growing up in
poverty, mostly in Limerick, Ireland. The book has already sold
more than 2 million copies in hardcover, a figure so large it meant
that the book sold well in every outlet, independent and chain,
although it did get its blastoff largely from word of mouth in the
independents. The paperback will be in the stores at the end of the
month, and the movie in theaters later in the year. The sequel,
``Tis,'' is scheduled for publication in September. The writer is
working on a novel about teaching and marriage, what he calls ``a
cross between `Goodbye, Chips' and `Who's Afraid of Virginia
Woolf?'''
</P>
<P>
   Beneath this wearisome book publishing melee lie some serious
concerns. Independent booksellers, with some justification,
consider themselves under siege by Barnes &AMP; Noble, Borders, the
Internet and Wal-Mart. In 1991 the association had 5,200 members
and now has 3,300, according to the association president, Richard
Howorth, who owns Square Books, a store in Oxford, Miss. ``This
year is the first time since 1991 that there was an increase in the
number of independent book stores, a slight one,'' he said, ``but
at least the decline stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   At the convention, Andrew Ross, owner of Cody's Bookstore in
Berkeley, Calif., offered a resolution demanding that McCourt
return his Abby. ``It lost badly because booksellers are polite and
respectful of authors,'' Ross said. ``But I thought it was
provocative and it put out our thoughts and our principles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is that many authors are ignoring the fact that
bookselling is becoming dominated by a few corporations which are
putting out the idea that our culture is homogeneous,'' he said.
``We were trying to make the point to Frank McCourt that we need
diversity, multiplicity, and that it was reasonable to help enforce
our independence and not be a pitch man for the chains.''
</P>
<P>
   Given McCourt's background, it would seem inappropriate to
lecture him on cultural diversity. And in fact, the association is
trying out more pertinent responses to its members being gobbled up
by chains. Many independents are sponsoring author breakfasts and
other events that bring authors and readers together. When an
author does a bookselling appearance at a store, it is supported by
cash from the publisher, and the bigger the store, the more money
it gets.
</P>
<P>
   The association is also starting what it calls its Book Sense
marketing program, and so far 900 members have signed contracts to
be part of it. The program will have its own bookselling Web site
to compete with Barnes &AMP; Noble's and Amazon. It will have a Book
Sense logo on all its member advertisements and promotional
material and its own slogan, ``Independent Bookstores for
Independent Minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Its first advertisement has been published in The New York Times
and elsewhere and is to be repeated. In the association's desire to
project the independent bookstore as the epitome of neighborliness
as well as a gathering place for unconstrained minds, the ad uses
an extraordinary metaphor, the pizzeria. It features the cover of a
take-home pizza box imprinted with the words: ``Original. Variety
of Taste. Just like your family-run pizzeria. Your Independent
Bookstore.''
</P>
<P>
   One would think the association might be better off taking up
McCourt's offer to do a commercial for them.

   Feats of circus art that reach literally breathtaking heights of
skill are among the pleasures awaiting the children and adults
lucky enough to make their way to the New Victory Theater, where
the New Shanghai Circus is providing entertainment in abundance
through May 23.
</P>
<P>
   In acts that often trace their origins to the harvest festivals
of more than 2,000 years ago, this youthful, handsome and graceful
company spends a swift two hours in a range of demanding
performances, most of them typifying Chinese circus and
constituting a refreshing alternative to the Western tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Under the direction of Zhao Lizhi, the artistry, individually
and collectively, attains levels that make it seem almost unfair to
single out any act, from the contortionists, acrobats and jugglers
to the comic knife throwers and the bicyclist who finishes by
piling about 10 of his colleagues aboard his vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of circus of any sort are bound to appreciate the young
women spinning six plates at a time atop sticks, while one of their
number goes through amazing contortions without ever dropping a
dish. And what about the young woman who stacks chair atop chair on
a fragile foundation of four vases atop a table, and makes her way
acrobatically to the pinnacle of this rickety structure?
</P>
<P>
   Or the young man who juggles a huge jar, usually using only his
back or shoulders, and catching it on edge atop his head? Or the
young man who builds an absolutely ungainly structure of more than
20 wooden benches and balances them on his head? What is the secret
of the young woman who manages to lie horizontally with no apparent
support but the point of a sword placed against the back of her
neck?
</P>
<P>
   And let no one overlook an act called the nose balance, in which
a young woman balances a glass of water on her nose, covers it with
a glass plate, adds four small glasses, covers them with a plate
and proceeds to build a lofty, glassy structure before beginning a
series of acrobatic moves and then walking across a bridge of light
bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   Confronted by feats like this, onlookers can catch their breath
while witnessing a very funny knife-throwing act and soothing eye
and ear with the consistently artful costumes, atmospheric lighting
and music.

`HOME TOWN': NO FRANK CAPRA HERE, OR JONATHAN EDWARDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.) (DW) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At first you think that Tracy Kidder's new book, ``Home Town,''
is going to present an idyllic profile of Northampton, Mass., one
consistent with the author's opening view of it from nearby Mount
Holyoke: ``From the summit, the cornfields are a dream of perfect
order, and the town seems entirely coherent, self-contained, a
place where a person might live a whole life and consider it
complete, a tiny civilization all its own. Forget the messiness of
years and days _ every work of human artifice has a proper viewing
distance. The town below fits in the palm of your hand. Shake it
and it snows.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moving closer, Kidder's focus tightens on the life of Tommy
O'Connor, whose happy childhood as a Northampton townie suggests
Frank Capra's film ``It's a Wonderful Life,'' without the hero's
frustration and sense of being stuck. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tommy has grown up to fulfill his childhood dream of becoming a
policeman. (On the wall inside the closet of the room he grew up in
is written in crayon ``Tom O'Connor September 29, 1972 / I want to
be a policeman / I am in sixth grade.'') The town he works in is
not just the site of prestigious Smith College but also a
successful experiment in urban restoration whose heart is a mix of
Woodstock Nation and Main Street, where some 40 restaurants thrive
and kids feel free to display their hair dyed the more unlikely
colors of the rainbow. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But as Tommy drives his rounds you begin to sense an atmosphere
less like a Capra film and more like something by Stephen King.
Tommy knows that in the festive downtown crowds are dealers pushing
crack cocaine. Crises in which he frequently has to intervene
involve drunken or addicted former high school mates.
</P>
<P>
   Within three chapters, Tommy is approached by a somber Rick
Janacek, not only a fellow cop but also Tommy's childhood neighbor
and best friend. Rick confides that as well as having a severe
problem with alcohol he has been barred by his wife from contacting
her or their children. The restraining order has accused Rick of
sexually abusing one of his daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way anything could have happened with me is if I was
in a blackout,'' Rick says, an admission that Tommy knows from
experience is usually a sign of guilt. Having heard Rick confess as
much, Tommy feels he will have to report the conversation to the
district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Janacek is the first of four major close-ups of Northampton
citizens that Kidder presents against the background of the town's
daily life and history. The others are an odd assortment. There is
Alan Scheinman, an erstwhile real estate entrepreneur who suffers
so severely from obsessive-compulsive disorder that he has to keep
his hands wrapped in plastic and can't remove the garbage from his
apartment. There is Francisco (Frankie) Sandoval, alias Samson
Rodriguez, a crack cocaine addict and dealer who works as a snitch
for Tommy. Finally there is Laura Baumeister, a mother on welfare
who has won a scholarship to Smith but doubts that she can handle
the class work. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even Tommy turns out not to be so pleased with his life.
Although he loves his hometown and has won promotions and prizes
for his superlative police work, he is frustrated by the lack of a
child in his happy marriage and feels too often that his career has
come to ``a dead halt.'' What is Kidder trying to do with this
gallery of misfits? For the reader their histories are a mixed
experience. Sandoval's is edifying, telling you a lot about life in
the underclass. Baumeister's is inspiring; she masters her class
work and ends up in love with ``Paradise Lost.'' Scheinman's is
fascinating at first but gets to be a bit of a bore; he more or
less cures himself of his obsessive-compulsiveness but he spews a
fair amount of psychobabble in describing the process. As for
Tommy, although he is no misfit, his solution to his discontents is
cheering. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But what is Kidder's point in offering such a lopsided profile
of Northampton?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently it is to illustrate how the tolerance and
cohesiveness of his town embraces all extremes. After all, he
reminds you in one excursion into the past, this is the town that
eventually threw out Jonathan Edwards, author of the sermon
``Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God'' and arbiter of
Northampton's morals.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Celebrating the place's diversity, Kidder writes: ``The town has
American Legion baseball and contra dancing, a small Buddhist
church and a very active Elks club, homes that cost $400,000 and
many boardinghouses and halfway houses. Somehow it works.
Northampton is the kind of place where a professor, a potter,
unemployed musician, former mental patient, a woman with a handsome
alimony, can all be found on Sunday mornings sitting near one
another at sidewalk tables outside the coffee shops. Somehow _ is
it the sum of unconcerted efforts? _ a cohesive property seems to
bind the place, as if it were a liquid held by surface tension.''
In an interview describing his experience in getting to know
Northampton, Kidder has said: ``The picture that I'd held in my
mind began not to fall apart, but to fragment, the way a
pointillist painting turns into a bunch of small dots if you move
too close to it _ except that the dots in this case were in
themselves interesting, and sometimes appalling.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What his book succeeds in doing is bring the dots together
again. The picture they form is far from pretty, but it certainly
coheres. Shake it and it weeps.

 &HT;    Expand your culinary borders with variety of Mexican cheeses
 &HT;    By Kitty Crider
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The enchiladas at your favorite Tex-Mex spot are
blanketed in melted yellow cheese.
</P>
<P>
   The refried black beans at an interior Mexican restaurant are
sprinkled with crumbled white cheese.
</P>
<P>
   The two dishes are a border apart.
</P>
<P>
   Tex-Mex cooks tend to use a heavy hand with vivid Velveetas and
Cheddars. With a few regional exceptions, South-of-the-Border cooks
opt for a lighter touch, and the quesos, or cheeses, tend to be
white with flowing descriptive names:
</P>
<P>
   Queso fresco _ fresh cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Queso anejo _ aged cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Queso asadero _ roasted cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Flavorful and rich, these quesos are crumbled on top of beans
and appetizers; stuffed into tortillas, enchiladas, quesadillas;
melted with chiles for scooping.
</P>
<P>
   Cheeses are so integral to Mexican cooking that it is hard to
believe that they are not native to the New World, says Patricia
Quintana, author of ``The Taste of Mexico.'' But Mexicans learned
the art of cheesemaking from the Spaniards when the Europeans
introduced cattle in the early 16th century, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Now more North Americans are discovering these quesos. As
Mexican food has caught on nationwide and as the Hispanic
population has moved northward, so has the interest in the quesos
of Mexico. Cacique, a popular brand of Mexican-style cheeses from
California, says sales have increased more than 20 percent
nationwide in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is more to life than Monterey Jack,'' says longtime
Austin chef Miguel Ravago. Mexican quesos, with their increased
availability, are fun to explore, he adds. ``They have unique
flavors. They taste wonderful with corn tortillas. And crumbled
queso over tacos with two sauces is much better than with feta or
other cheese. ``
</P>
<P>
   Mexican cheeses are loosely categorized into three types: fresh,
aged and melting.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh quesos tend to be soft, crumbly and white, ideal for
sprinkling on tops of appetizers, beans, salads and other dishes.
Queso fresco or queso blanco is the generic label for these
cheeses, which are similar to mild feta or fresh goat cheese.
</P>
<P>
   The aged cheeses are harder, drier and saltier. Suitable for
grating, they might be compared to Parmesan cheese or pecorino
Romano.
</P>
<P>
   For stuffing peppers, enchiladas or quesadillas, Mexican cooks
opt for cheeses that melt easily: queso Chihuahua, queso asadero
and queso Oaxaca. The latter is known as Mexican string cheese, and
whether it is sold in a rope, balls of various sizes, or round
slices, the strands are visible.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's most famous melting cheese is Chihuahua, says Rick
Bayless, Chicago chef and author of ``Rick Bayless' Mexican
Kitchen.'' Some people also call it queso menonita because it was
introduced by Mennonites who emigrated to Mexico more than half a
century ago. This cheese is often melted for queso fundido or
enchiladas suizas. Move over, Monterey Jack.
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis here is on ``Mexican-style.'' In Mexico, many
cheeses are made from unpasteurized milk. That's a no-no in the
United States, unless the cheeses have been aged 60 days. According
to the Food and Drug Administration, Mexican quesos or any cheeses
made in this country must begin with pasteurized milk if they are
to be sold fresh.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the cheeses are manufactured in a way
similar to the quesos that are so popular in Mexico. The emphasis
here is on ``similar.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no standard of identity for the Mexican cheeses. Even
in Mexico, from town to town, similar cheeses have different
names,'' says Paula Lambert, owner and founder of the Mozzarella
Company in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Her 17-year-old company, which has won national awards for its
cheeses, makes Mexican-style queso fresco and queso blanco, as well
as a variety spiced with chiles and epazote. She also manufactures
queso Oaxaca, a string cheese stretched out to a long ribbon, then
wrapped into a half-pound yarnlike ball.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Santibanez, executive chef of Fonda San Miguel and
formerly of Mexico, laments that most Mexican-style cheeses north
of the border are not the same quality or flavor as those south.
The cheeses in Mexico often are not made from pasteurized milk,
which some believe kills the taste while eliminating the bacteria.
They are not chilled there, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like our cheeses to get dry. We leave them outside. We
never put them in the refrigerator, `` he says, regretting that
here he can't get his favorite Cotija cheese, a goat cheese, here.
</P>
<P>
   Chefs often make substitutions when they can't find a cheese
like one they have used or eaten in Mexico. Santibanez has been
known to buy an Armenian string cheese here that is similar to a
Oaxacan queso. Bayless says if he can't find queso fresco, he
substitutes a pressed, salted farmer's cheese, fresh goat cheese
(even though it does not crumble as well), feta (soaked in cool
water to leach out some of the salt), or dry cottage cheese (with
salt added).
</P>

   There are many poor, rubbery copies of Mexican cheese made in
the states, says Diana Kennedy of Michoacan, author of ``The
Cuisines of Mexico.'' To test for quality, this Mexican-food purist
suggests melting the cheese over low heat. If it melts or softens
easily and looks shiny with fat, it is good. If it turns into
rubbery lumps, look for another brand, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Chef Ravago says he definitely thinks you can find much, much
better Mexican cheeses here now. ``You are not going to get exactly
the same thing as Mexico, but close to it,'' says Ravago, co-author
of ``Cocina de la Familia.'' Ravago, whose family is from Mexico,
says the variety here is much better now, too. Twenty-five years
ago, you could buy one Mexican cheese. ``It was a melting cheese
for quesadillas. I think it was asadero or something like that. And
I found it at a specialty store.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the cheeses are everywhere. Everyday use is easy.
</P>
<P>
   So in his home refrigerator now, Ravago has queso blanco for
beans, tostadas and lasagne.
</P>
<P>
   Home cook Maria Fountaine would nod with approval. Queso fresco
is just a good all-purpose cheese, for quesadillas, enchiladas and
tacos, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Viva el queso. Queso Tip: Wrap cheese with fresh plastic
</P>
<P>
   Most people don't know this: Each time you remove cheese from
the refrigerator, tightly rewrap it in a new, fresh piece of
plastic wrap. This will reduce contamination by bacteria and mold.
(This hint is for all cheeses, not just Mexican quesos.) Tightly
wrapped, queso fresco or blanco will keep a month in the
refrigerator.

<P>
   A PRIMER ON THE QUESOS
</P>
<P>
   Asadero (ah-sah-DEH-roh): Translates as ``broiler'' or
``roaster.'' This white cheese comes in balls, rounds and braids.
It melts easily when heated and strings nicely. Good in tortilla
soup. Substitute: Monterey Jack.
</P>
<P>
   Chihuahua (chi-WAH-wah): A mild, spongy, pale-yellow cheese
originally made in great wheels in the Mennonite farming
communities in the state of Chihuahua. Because of its high fat
content, it melts easily. Good in enchiladas suizas and
quesadillas. Substitute: Mild Cheddar or Monterey Jack.
</P>
<P>
   Panela (pah-NEH-lah): A semi-soft, smooth, white cheese, with a
woven imprint on the surface of the cheese from the draining
basket. Good as an appetizer, as garnish on cold dishes, or melted.
Substitute: Monterey Jack.
</P>
<P>
   Queso fresco (KEH-so FREH-sko): Translates as ``fresh cheese.''
The most common cheese in Mexico, it is crumbled and used as a
topping for appetizers, for stuffing chiles, for Mexican lasagne,
or sprinkling on beans. Substitute: feta.
</P>
<P>
   Queso blanco (KEH-so BLAHN-ko): A generic term that means
``white cheese.'' Interchangeable with queso fresco.
</P>
<P>
   Anejo (ah-NYAY-ho): Translates as ``old'' or ``aged.'' These
cheeses are harder, drier, saltier and suitable for grating. Good
on appetizers. Substitute: Parmesan.
</P>
<P>
   Queso enchilado (KEH-so en-chee-LAH-do): A queso anejo which has
been ribbed with powdered red chile. Good for enchiladas.
</P>
<P>
   Queso Oaxaca (KEH-so wah-HAH-cah): The specialty of the state of
Oaxaca. Known as Mexican string cheese, it is sold in a rope, balls
of various sizes, or round slices. A good melting cheese, it can be
used in quesadillas, or chile con queso. Substitute: mozzarella.
</P>
<P>
   Queso caution
</P>
<P>
   _ The U.S. Department of Agriculture advises that soft cheeses _
whether they are Mexican-style quesos, feta, brie, blue cheeses or
others _ have the potential for listeria contamination, which can
cause serious illness to adults or even death to unborn babies.
Those particularly at risk include pregnant women, newborns, the
elderly, and people with compromised immune systems from AIDS,
chemotherapy or other medical conditions.

</P>
<P>
   1/2 medium onion, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 clove garlic, peeled and finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   5 chiles poblanos, roasted and peeled or 7 canned, peeled green
chilies
</P>
<P>
   About 4 cups corn (1 1/2 pounds frozen corn or kernels from 5
ears)
</P>
<P>
   1/4 pound Chihuahua cheese, in small cubes
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   Thick sour cream
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Melt the butter and cook the onion and garlic, without browning,
until they are soft.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the chiles into rajas (strips), add them to the pan and cook
them, covered, 8 minutes for poblanos, 5 minutes for canned chiles.
</P>
<P>
   Add the corn, cheese and salt to the chili mixture. Cover
tightly with foil or a lid and let bake for 20 minutes for frozen
corn. If you use fresh corn, cook for 40 minutes, adding the cheese
after the first 20 minutes of cooking time. Serve hot with sour
cream. Serves 6.
</P>
<P>
   Note: This is a very rich dish, and is very good served as a
separate course with hot tortillas. It is best eaten right after
it's cooked, as the cheese gets tough when reheated. For a change,
the chiles could be left whole, stuffed with corn and cheese, and
cooked in cream.

strips will spice it up. Toast the tortilla on an open flame until
warmed through, sprinkle on the shredded Mexican Chihuahua cheese
or Monterey Jack, fold over and microwave on high on a plate for 10
to 20 seconds, just to melt cheese. Serve immediately.

A COAL-MINING REGION'S RICH VEIN OF CELEBRITY MUSICIANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., Ohio, Okla., Tenn., Texas, W.Va.)  (rk) 
 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RUSSELL, Ky. _ On this spring day, at least, last period
assembly at Russell High School was a special occasion with a
distinctly local flavor. Julie Reeves, a 24-year-old country singer
with a new recording contract, had returned from Nashville to her
alma mater in the Appalachian hills to belt out a few tunes in the
gym and give the seniors a pep talk.
</P>
<P>
   Introducing her, Ann Mullins, the music teacher, reminded
everyone what a dedicated choir member her former student had been.
``You have just as much of a chance to make it big as Julie Reeves
has,'' she added. Then Ms. Reeves took the microphone, urging the
students to stay in school, have faith in God and consider the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always have to think, `What if my dream of being a star
doesn't come true?''' she said. ``Do you have a backup plan?''
</P>
<P>
   Then she launched into the rollicking ``Trouble Is a Woman,''
the lead song on her album ``It's About Time,'' which was being
released that day in April. Many students sang along, having
apparently learned the words from the video already being shown on
Country Music Television.
</P>
<P>
   When the song was over, the students' shouting and applause
resounded in the rafters, and though they were just teen-agers
thrilled by a brush with fame, they may well have been jubilant
that the harvest was in or that the king's line had been
perpetuated.
</P>
<P>
   Country singers are bred in this tri-state area of West
Virginia, Ohio and Kentucky, where the Ohio and Big Sandy Rivers
converge. An occasional record contact and music video for one of
the locals is seen as a birthright. Denizens try to explain the
wealth of talent with a shrug. Everyone grows up singing in church,
they say, and there's not much to do around here except make your
own entertainment. But they also like to say there's something in
the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what we were going to call our business,'' said Danny
Craig, a songwriter and advertising consultant who is the
co-founder, with Charlie Stewart, a Russell policeman, of a
fledgling music management firm that is scouting and developing
local singers. ```It's in the Water.'''
</P>
<P>
   Coal notwithstanding, country music singers might well be the
leading export of the region, which is centered on Ashland, Ky. (a
city of 27,000 with an oil refinery and two Wal-Marts), and extends
about 100 miles between, say, Portsmouth, Ohio, and Pikeville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   An otherwise unprepossessing strip of America, it has produced
an astonishing roster of stars: Patty Loveless, Ricky Skaggs,
Dwight Yoakam, the Judds, Keith Whitley, Crystal Gayle and Loretta
Lynn, among others.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are several areas in America that produce an
inordinately high number of artists _ Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana _
but this may be the biggest,'' said Scott Hendricks, the president
of Virgin Records/Nashville, Ms. Reeves' label.
</P>
<P>
   The highway that cuts through the region's heart, U.S. 23, has
been memorialized as a coal-hauling route in a song by Yoakam
(``Readin', Rightin', Route 23''). Not quite two years ago it was
designated the Country Music Highway by the state of Kentucky, a
bit of legislation helped along by former state Rep. Ron Cyrus,
whose son, Billy Ray, made the music video for his hit ``Achy
Breaky Heart'' at the Paramount Theater on U.S. 23 in downtown
Ashland.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Reeves sang for the gym full of students the other day,
she was merely repeating Billy Ray's homecoming; he went to Russell
High, too.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make people forget the Hatfields and the McCoys,
who also lived in the neighborhood. But oddly enough, as a musical
trove it is a bit of a secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people in Nashville have put it together that
Patty Loveless and Dwight Yoakam have come from the same place,''
said Mark Brown, the former vice president for Capitol
Records/Nashville, who is now dating Ms. Reeves. ``Until I met
Julie I didn't realize how much talent was here. We go out to a bar
and hear a local band and it's just awesome. There's got to be
something in the water.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Hendricks, speaking from Nashville, conceded, ``I don't
know if anyone in this town has gone in there to seek out new
talent.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Bible-quoting, snuff-dipping, coal-mining territory,
culturally if not geographically remote, as ethnically homogeneous
as anywhere in the nation. It is a place where amiability is the
rule, where the accent, borrowing from the South and the mountains,
is thick and rolling and the idiom is full of ``yonders'' and
``you'uns'' and metaphors that couldn't grow anywhere but in a
country garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know beans from apple butter,'' said Craig, 46, the
songwriter and talent scout, recalling his early visits to
Nashville a decade ago, when he was part of a trio that included a
teen-age Ms. Reeves and her mother, Rosemary. ``This is Hicksville,
man. It's Mayberry. We're hillbillies.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are the very things that may account for the new local
music and the obscurity of its origins. The area cannot really be
said to have a sound. The famous names who have come out of here
recently _ from the balladeering Judds with their heartbreaking
harmonies, to the more rock-oriented Ms. Loveless and Cyrus, to the
western-tinged Yoakam, to gospel star Michael W. Smith _ draw on a
variety of musical influences and predilections. Their work is a
good indication of how the Nashville sound has broadened, becoming
more commercial and more oriented toward rock and rhythm-and-blues
over the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   But musicians here say they can tell by a singer's locution if
he or she comes from the area. They have a hard time describing why
except that it all sounds so country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter what you sing, it's got a twang in it,''
said Billy Joe Cantrell, 23, of Portsmouth, who plays guitar and
sings in the Midnight Thunder band behind Brandon Caserta, an
aspiring country crooner from Huntington, W. Va. ``Brandon used to
sing opera and he sounded like a country opera singer.''
</P>
<P>
   Rock-and-roll intervened here for a couple of decades, usurping
the regional sounds; even Caserta, who is 21, said he grew up
listening to '70s rock. But now, inspired by a remarkable series of
local boys and girls made good (and a contemporary country idiom
that carries more pop and rock sounds than ever), the enthusiasm is
hearty and intense, particularly among the young. Among the singers
generating the best local buzz are Jessica Lynn Baldridge, 15, of
Flatwoods, Ky., and Kayla Hall, of Wurtland, Ky., who is 10. 10!
</P>
<P>
   ``What gets me is the younger people around here getting into
country music now,'' said Bob Shelpman, a 43-year-old guitarist
from Portsmouth who recently played behind Ms. Reeves and Caserta.
``When I was 20 or 21 and I was playing country, I kind of had to
hide it from my buddies.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The new music builds upon a tradition of lightning-quick banjo
players, energetic fiddlers and washtub-bass-and-moonshine-bottle
bands. And it is the traditional home of bluegrass; Bill Monroe was
a Kentuckian. It is a place where, as Jack Hicks, who played for
years with Conway Twitty and lives outside of Ashland, said,
``Everybody picks, everybody I know just picks.''
</P>
<P>
   The indigenous bluegrass sound lives on most notably in
Nashville in the music of Skaggs, who is often spoken of as the
finest, technically, of the local musicians. Dorothy Skaggs,
Ricky's mother, a former singer who still lives in Blaine, Ky., a
few miles off U.S. 23, remembers her husband, her three sons and
her daughter's entertaining 45 or 50 people in the living room. The
musicianship in her family goes back to the previous century.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandfather, Harmon Griffith, was an old-fashioned banjo
player,'' she said. ``When I was a girl I watched him make banjo
heads. He made them out of groundhog hides.''
</P>
<P>
   Another tradition, the heart-rending country crooner, was
personified locally by Whitley, who died of alcohol poisoning 10
years ago. Since then Whitley has attained the status of local
legend.
</P>
<P>
   A handsome man who was a boyhood friend of the portly Skaggs
(``Ricky used to tell us, `I like comin' over here to eat because
you'uns cook with lard,''' recalled Mary Whitley-Bailey, Whitley's
sister), his memory is kept alive by, among other things, an annual
motorcycle ride by his fans from the family home in Sandy Hook,
Ky., to his grave in Nashville, which usually picks up several
hundred bikers along the way.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that this combination of old-style
tradition and new-style celebrity has given rise to the idea that
there is something here to sell. Entrepreneurs are surfacing.
</P>
<P>
   Craig and Stewart (who is married to Ms. Reeves' mother) started
their company, Kentucky Blue, in the belief that there is more
golden talent in these hills than has already been dug up. They
represent Caserta and another singer, Carol Bryant, 27, the sales
manager at the Holiday Inn in Huntington, whom they are trying to
position for the contemporary gospel market.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Judy Jennings, the general manager of WTCR, a country
radio station based in Huntington, has organized monthly concerts
at the Paramount in Ashland, each with local singers followed by a
headliner from Nashville. Called the Highway 23 Jamboree, the
nonprofit programs are modeled after the Grand Ole Opry, with a
house band and amiable masters of ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   The last jamboree a couple of weeks ago featured half a dozen
local singers, including a vamping 9-year-old girl from Milton, W.
Va. (``I can love you better than that,'' she sang), a 15-year-old
boy from Coal Grove, Ohio, wearing a white cowboy hat and crooning
``I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry'' in a sweet adolescent alto, and
20-year-old Amy Chaney, an Ashland girl with a stately bearing, an
hourglass figure and a sequined orange stretch suit of her own
design who was being scouted by a road manager for Randy Travis.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 800 people in the audience was Paula Rideout, who has
lived in the same house in Ashland for nearly 50 years, during
which time her daughter Naomi Judd and her granddaughter Wynonna
have come to some prominence. (So has Wynonna's sister, Ashley, the
actress.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't explain it, why we have what we have,'' Ms. Rideout
said. ``It's just the mother lode here, and now we've tapped into
it.''

$6 MILLION GOES TO 179 IN GUGGENHEIM AWARDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)  (js) 
 By KATHRYN SHATTUCK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among this year's 179 recipients of over $6 million in
Guggenheim Fellowships are the playwright Jon Robin Baitz, the
Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Carol Shields, the biographer
Claudia Roth Pierpont, the writer Junot Diaz, the choreographer
Blondell Cummings and, by coincidence, two historians, Joseph H.
Lynch and Robert C. Davis, who have adjacent offices at Ohio State
University.
</P>
<P>
   The fellowships were awarded by the John Simon Guggenheim
Memorial Foundation to the artists, scholars and scientists who
emerged from its 75th annual competition. Of this year's $6.062
million, eight fiction and five nonfiction writers will share
$455,000.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Conarroe, the president of the foundation, said its
six-member committee of selection had made its choices from among
nearly 2,800 applicants. The recommendations were approved by the
foundation's trustees, who include three new members who are
themselves past Guggenheim Fellows: the writer Joyce Carol Oates,
the playwright Wendy Wasserstein and the composer Ellen Taaffe
Zwilich. The fellows were appointed on the basis of distinguished
achievement and exceptional promise for future accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're people who have already made significant contributions
to the field and are at a point where they are about to do
something very fine,'' Conarroe said. This year's winners range in
age from their late 20s to their late 70s.
</P>
<P>
   The grants average $34,000 and are not restricted in use, though
applicants must specify what goal in their field they would like to
pursue. ``The idea is to give fellows a period of creativity away
from other responsibilities, whether it's teaching, administering,
whatever,'' Conarroe said.

   Since its inception, the foundation has awarded more than $185
million in fellowships to some 14,000 individuals. It was
established by Simon Guggenheim, an industrialist who was a senator
from Colorado from 1907 to 1913, and his wife, Olga, a
philanthropist and art patron, as a memorial to their son, John
Simon, who died on April 26, 1922. (The Guggenheim Museum was
founded by a brother, Solomon.)
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 fellows include writers, painters, sculptors,
photographers, filmmakers, choreographers, physical and biological
scientists, social scientists and scholars in the humanities. Some
work independently and others are from 92 American and Canadian
colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
   A list of the 1999 fellows is available from the foundation at
90 Park Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10016, or on the foundation's Web
site: www.gf.org

   ATT-CABLELANDSCAPE _ The landscape of the cable industry changed
over night when AT&AMP;T emerged the victor in the fight for MediaOne.
Comcast, the loser and the no.4 cable operator, was able to wrest
some concessions from AT&AMP;T, what does this mean for the other cable
operators liked Cox Communications. Will there be a flurry of
consolidation among the remaining players? Will consumers get more
services at a cheaper rate? (Haddad, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   ATT-BELLSOUTH _ How will BellSouth and other telcos respond now
that AT&AMP;T has emerged triumphant in the battle for MediaOne making
it the nation's biggest cable company as well as phone company.
Will this spur BellSouth and other telephone companies to hurry
with their deployment of DSL, the telephone version of high speed
Internet access. How will consumer benefit. (Hzzzke, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   ALALEGIS-HONDA _ The Alabama legislature considers a package of
economic incentives that might solidify Honda's decision to build
an auto assembly plant near Lincoln. We look at the package they
offered Mercedes and how Georgia did or did not compete. (Ritzler,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   MINDSPRING-BELLSOUTH _ MindSpring finally makes deal with
BellSouth to offer DSL service to MindSpring customers. This ends a
long period of antagonism between the ISP and BellSouth over access
and pricing for ``last mile'' access. (Hzzzke, Atlana
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   BIZMAGS _ Mike Milken's name was once synbonymous with Wall
Street fraud and graft. connected especially with the insider
trading scandals of the 1980s. Many of his friends always contended
that he was a scapegoat for others who were the real culprits. At
any rate, Milkin served time in jail and has now started another
successful career. (Walker, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   BBO-NUHN-MINORLEAGUES _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Jim and Paul are minor
league devotees. They grew up in Toledo, thus their allegiance to
the Mud Hens. Jim says he's ``over 40.'' Paul is 39. That was Jim
walking around Dayton's Courthouse Square in his Mud Hens' uniform
on Monday when the new Dayton minor league team unveiled its name
(Dragons), uniforms and logo, ``just to show my support for minor
league baseball,'' he said. Every year for the past 11 years, the
brothers have made one week-long trip and another extended weekend
trip to minor league games, mostly but not always following farm
clubs of the Tigers. Their count is now 11 leagues and 63 parks.
When Dayton starts next spring, it's going to be a nice, easy 64th.

season. ``It's almost 100 percent,'' he said. Almost. (Woods, Palm

<P>
   GLF-SENIOR _ Bruce Fleisher is like many successful Senior Tour
golfers. After being a PGA Tour journeyman, he found his
comfortable niche on the Senior Tour and has turned that niche into
three 1999 victories and a comfortable living. (Sheeley, Atlanta

   GLF-DOYLE _ LA GRANGE, GA. _ When Allen Doyle headed to the
Senior PGA Tour at the beginning of the season, he was hoping to
earn some pocket change to help send his kids to college. He has
done that. In three short months, Doyle has earned almost $1
million after two victories _ including a major _ and several top-5
finishes. His success has been so dramatic that the grass at
Doyle's old driving range in LaGrange, Ga., isn't looking so green

<P>
   FEN-HUMMER-FENCING _ The stance is slightly balletic, front foot
pointed straight forward, back foot turned at a right angle. I
assume it without requiring an orthopedic device, a fine start. The
dress is straight from the Hannibal Lecter collection _ a white
coat that is just two straps away from being a straitjacket and a
bird cage that fits snugly over the head. I might borrow the outfit
the next time the dental hygienist tries to get at me. The language
is like something stolen from a good wine list. En garde. Epee.
Maitre d'Armes. The list of French fighting words can't be very
long, but they're all here. The instructor, well, he has just
raised his blunted foil to me and said something along the lines
of, ``You have sullied my sister and for this you must die!'' Gene
Gettler was only kidding. At least he seemed to be. If he wasn't, I
think I might well have sullied my shorts. This is my introduction
to fencing. It's not just for European fops anymore. (Hummer,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). WITH PHOTOS.

Senior PGA Tour at the beginning of the season, he was hoping to
earn some pocket change to help send his kids to college. He has
done that. In three short months, Doyle has earned almost $1
million after two victories _ including a major _ and several top-5
finishes. His success has been so dramatic that the grass at
Doyle's old driving range in LaGrange, Ga., isn't looking so green
anymore. (Sheeley, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 55. MOVED. WITH

DO THOSE NASTY OL' FREEDOMS NEED REVISING?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nation's politicians have figured out the cause of all these
murderous rampages by school kids.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe we should say that some of the politicians have it
figured out one way, and some have it figured out another way.
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell: Conservatives believe that the violence is caused
by the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States;
liberals believe that the culprit is the Second Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   They don't say this in so many words, of course. They talk about
the lethal menace that is posed by the proliferation of violent TV
shows, or movies, or video games. They talk about the lethal menace
that is posed by the availability of guns.
</P>
<P>
   But cut through the partisan rhetoric and ideological claptrap,
and the message from these folks is clear. Each side is blaming the
recent killings in places such as Littleton, Colo., and Jonesboro,
Ark., on a precious freedom guaranteed by the Constitution: either
freedom of speech or the right to bear arms.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a question: If politicians in Washington and around the
country are truly convinced that a constitutional provision written
more than 200 years ago is causing all this trouble, why don't they
step up to the plate and propose that the provision be repealed?
</P>
<P>
   It would make for a fascinating debate in Congress, that's for
sure.
</P>
<P>
   How interesting to hear Republicans argue for the elimination of
that pesky old First Amendment, the one that allows so many amazing
thoughts and words to find their way into our culture. How
intriguing to hear Democrats make the case for ridding the
Constitution of the Second Amendment, the one that allows
law-abiding citizens to take up arms against tyranny and injustice.
</P>
<P>
   Any fool can see that these freedoms have been abused _ that
Hollywood elitists have perverted the meaning of free speech, that
sociopathic misfits like those mass-murdering teen-agers in
Colorado have made a mockery of the right to bear arms.
</P>
<P>
   When the nation's founders conjured up the First Amendment, they
couldn't have envisioned cable TV and the Internet. When they went
to bat for the right to bear arms, it couldn't have occurred to
them that one day schoolboys would amass arsenals of assault rifles
and semiautomatic pistols and use them to gun down classmates.
</P>
<P>
   Hasn't society become too sophisticated, too complex and too
dangerous to accommodate the sort of simple concepts that are
expressed in the First and Second Amendments? Isn't it time that we
did away with such naive, outmoded ideas and started dealing with
reality as it exists at the threshold of the 21st century?
</P>
<P>
   Please stop me if you think I'm going nuts here. Here I am,
pondering the practicality of repealing the first two amendments of
the greatest legal document ever devised, and a few of you are
sitting there saying: ``You know, he has a point. Maybe it's time
we changed some of this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   At least I'm hoping it's a few. If it's a lot, this country is
in bigger trouble than I thought it was.
</P>
<P>
   But this exercise in hyperbolic lunacy has a purpose. I am
trying to make the point that it isn't all that large a leap from
tinkering with constitutional rights to demolishing them.
</P>
<P>
   The liberal-leaning interviewers on the TV networks have done
everything but laugh in Charlton Heston's face _ or spit in it _
during the past few days, and yet the actor-turned-president of the
National Rifle Association is exactly right when he notes that one
of the first official acts of any newly installed tyrant is to
confiscate the guns of the citizenry. We tamper with the Second
Amendment at our peril.
</P>
<P>
   And the media might take note: Right after tyrants grab up the
people's guns, they usually shut down their newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   It's only natural for society to yearn for answers in the
aftermath of tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it's also natural for politicians to exploit that
yearning by proposing unnecessary laws that promise easy solutions
but deliver no solutions at all.
</P>
<P>
   The people's job is to make sure they don't get away with it.
</P>

CHILDREN STAND BETWEEN HOSTESS AND PERFECTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA FRAZIER ANDERSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why can't they just understand, comprehend, or simply get it?
Why, why, why must I endure this torment from my family every six
to eight months? Where is the love? Where is the understanding?
Where is the furniture polish?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I'm having a party, a bridal shower to be exact. In just a
few hours, 30 to 40 of my dearest, closest, almost-perfect friends
will descend upon my residence to help me celebrate the pending
nuptials of my one and only little sister.
</P>
<P>
   I am a nervous wreck.
</P>
<P>
   There is so much to do! It's not just getting the invitations
out and preparing horse durves or whatever. I hate that word. I
always misspell it and I don't have time to look it up. I'm too
busy planning this party. I'm talking about preparing snacks, OK?
Anyway, it's not the standard ice bucket and centerpieces stuff
that makes entertaining an ordeal. Rather, it's the
behind-the-scenes stuff. You know, the toilet cleaning, furniture
polishing and strategic camouflage.
</P>
<P>
   I have taken papers, bills and all the other junk that's usually
lying around on the counters and have stuffed it all into every
drawer and cabinet that I thought no one could possibly have a
reason to open during the shower. I've cleaned the baseboards and
dusted the blinds. I've washed the walls and cleaned the windows. I
even sat in every chair so that I could see my guests' view and
make sure that no spiderweb or stray crumb was in sight.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, my husband has been quite helpful. The yard is
beautiful, every weed uprooted and the hedges symmetrical. He's
moved the furniture around for me half a dozen times, and right now
he's looking for that extra piece that makes the table wider.
</P>
<P>
   But goodness, these children of mine are doing their best to
prevent me from entering hostess heaven. I heard them grumbling
about me earlier today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom sounds like an owl, doesn't she? Every few minutes she
says, `Who? Who? Who?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Well, what am I supposed to say when they eat the beautiful
fruit that I bought specifically for the guests' viewing pleasure?
</P>
<P>
   ``Who ate one of the green apples? Didn't I tell you guys that
this fruit is for display only?''
</P>
<P>
   And when I went into the bathroom by the den, someone had
actually used the soap and splashed water on the mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who used this bathroom?'' I yelled to no one in particular.
``Didn't you see the Porta Potti that I rented? It's right there by
the driveway.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But Mom, we thought that was for your friends to use.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Goodness, no! I wouldn't let my friends go in there. That's
for you. There's even a comic book in there, and a can of Lysol.
Now don't go in the good bathroom again until the party's over.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But Mom,'' they protest, ``you said that our house is not a
museum, and you want it to be a place where we can enjoy ourselves.
What happened to that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was before this party came up. For the next two days, our
house is the Smithsonian, OK? Don't touch a thing and do not enter
the roped-off areas. Now go next door. The neighbors should be
eating dinner about now. Look hungry when they come to the door.
Hang around a while after you eat and remember to leave your shoes
in the garage when you come back.''
</P>
<P>
   I know. This is way off the deep end and totally unnecessary,
but I don't care. People are coming to my home and, by golly, that
garage is going to be dust-free before they get here. That's just
the way I am.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The round of important fine-art auctions that begins
at Sotheby's in Manhattan on Monday evening might be described as a
play in two acts. The first act could be called ``The Auctioneer's
Dream'': the collection of extraordinary Post-Impressionist
paintings from the estate of Betsey Cushing Roosevelt Whitney, a
New York socialite and philanthropist who died in March. The
Whitney collection, blockbuster material of pristine provenance,
should make for a near-perfect auction Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The second act, which includes two more sales at Sotheby's and
three at Christie's, could be labeled ``The Harsh Realities of the
Art Market.'' The offerings add up to a patchy selection of works
by major 19th- and 20th-century artists like Monet and Renoir,
Jasper Johns and Andy Warhol. These underscore the scarcity of
great art available. And that helps make the Whitney sale a major
event.
</P>
<P>
   During their 46-year marriage, Mrs. Whitney and her husband,
John Hay Whitney, a financier, publisher and former U.S. ambassador
to Britain who died in 1982, put together one of the most important
collections of modern masters in private hands. Mrs. Whitney left
works worth more than $300 million by van Gogh, Matisse, Picasso
and other masters to four major American museums. She left the
remaining paintings, drawings and sculptures to her two daughters,
Kate Whitney and Sara Wilford, who said they had decided to sell
many of them to help pay estate taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those rare moments in auction history,'' said
Charles Moffett, co-director of Sotheby's worldwide department of
Impressionist and modern art. ``No buyer could possibly make a
mistake.'' Others in the art world agree.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 50 works that will be sold Monday, two stand out:
Cezanne's ``Still Life With Curtain, Pitcher and Bowl of Fruit''
(1893-94), a first-rate example of one of his mature still lifes
that is estimated to sell for $25 million to $35 million, and
Seurat's ``Island of the Grande Jatte'' (1884), which carries the
same estimate. The Seurat is one of two large final preparatory
studies for his famous painting ``A Sunday on la Grande Jatte,''
which hangs in the Art Institute of Chicago. The other study, a
composition with figures, is in the Metropolitan Museum's
collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``My old curator's eye could see the Seurat hanging in several
museums,'' said Moffett.
</P>
<P>
   The Whitneys also collected Picassos, and in 1968 they bought
two important works from the collection of Gertrude Stein that are
included in the sale. ``The Newspaper'' (1912) is a widely
exhibited painting from the artist's high period of Analytical
Cubism and carries an estimate of $4 million to $6 million. ``Still
Life With Glass, Bottle of Rum and Bowl of Fruit,'' painted two
years later, is estimated to sell for $5 million to $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's and Christie's fight hard to win good estate property.
This season it was no surprise when Sotheby's announced itself the
winner of the Whitney estate, for the Whitneys had long been loyal
consignors to Sotheby's. In 1990 it sold one of the paintings from
their collection, Renoir's ``At the Moulin de la Galette,'' to
Japanese industrialist Ryoei Saito for $78.1 million. (In April,
Sotheby's sold the contents of Mrs. Whitney's five homes in a round
of sales that totaled $13.1 million.)
</P>
<P>
   Little other significant estate property has been available this
spring, leaving both Sotheby's and Christie's scrambling to find
top-quality art for sale while collectors are eager to buy and
money is plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem this season is that there isn't any sense
of urgency about having to sell,'' said Christopher Burge, chairman
of Christie's in America. ``People expect prices to go higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Both auction houses are selling a hefty number of paintings from
Japan, where banks that collected feverishly during the boom of the
1980s are now in financial trouble. Christie's has on offer works
owned by Lake Co., the Japanese consumer-loan concern that was
bought last year by GE Capital, the financial services arm of
General Electric.
</P>
<P>
   Lake has sent Christie's about 500 works valued at $250 million
that the auction house plans to sell over a number of years. For
sale on May 19 and 20 are Pissarro's ``Road from Versailles to St.
Germain in the Snow'' (1872), estimated at $1.4 million to $1.8
million; Braque's ``Landscape at L'Estaque'' (1906), estimated at
$1.5 million to $2 million, and Monet's ``Garden of Vetheuil''
(1881), which sold at Christie's in 1990 for $4.9 million and now
carries an estimate of $2.5 million to $3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   That work is just one of 13 Monets for sale this spring, with
Sotheby's offering five and Christie's eight. Asked why so many of
his works are now up for sale, Franck Giraud, head of Christie's
19th- and 20th-century art departments worldwide, said simply,
``It's a happy accident and highly unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Christie's offerings include many of Monet's familiar subjects,
including his garden in Giverny and Charing Cross Bridge. At
Sotheby's a Monet of a single haystack from 1891 was included in an
exhibition of 15 haystack paintings at the Durand-Ruel Gallery in
Paris the year it was painted. When it failed to sell at Christie's
in London in 1990, it was purchased by the members of the Nahmad
family, among the biggest auction buyers in the world, who are
selling it Tuesday at Sotheby's. It carries an $8 million to $12
million estimate.
</P>
<P>
   The Nahmads are also the sellers of another expensive painting
in Sotheby's Impressionist and modern art sale on Tuesday night,
Toulouse-Lautrec's 1889 ``Woman Seated in the Garden of Mr.
Forest,'' thought to fetch $6 million to $8 million. The painting
failed to sell at Christie's in 1991 and the Nahmads bought it
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Both auction houses are offering works with a lively sales
history. The star of Christie's sale of 19th-century and
Impressionist works Wednesday is van Gogh's ``Canal With
Washerwoman,'' a vividly colored landscape that captures the spot
where the women of Arles did their laundry. The painting was last
for sale at Sotheby's in 1984, when it sold for $1.7 million. Now
it is being offered with an estimate of about $20 million. ``It's
an event when van Gogh's like this come on the market,'' said
Giraud. ``They're simply not available any more, and collectors
know it.''
</P>
<P>
   One collection of 20th-century art that is generating a lot of
interest is being sold at Christie's next Thursday by a Chicago
couple, Maurice and Margo Cohen. A highlight of the collection is
Leger's ``Three Women with a Bouquet'' (1922), which combines an
elongated nude figure with two clothed women. It is similar to
``The Big Breakfast,'' a scene of three women painted a year
earlier that is in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art. The
work is expected to bring $5 million to $7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's contemporary sale, which includes only art from the
last three decades, offers works by artists like Robert Gober,
Christopher Wool and Cindy Sherman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to imagine the dream sale and made a list of artists,
even works I wanted to sell,'' said Philippe Segalot, who runs
Christie's contemporary art department in New York. One example is
Gober's ``Untitled (Leg With Candle),'' a sculpture of a human leg
fashioned from wax, human hair, leather, cotton and wood, with a
white candle sticking out of its shin; it is estimated to sell for
$300,000 to $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's contemporary art sale May 18, which, unlike
Christie's, encompasses art from 1945 to the present, includes two
important Warhols, part of the group of contemporary works from the
estate of the German collector Helmut Kraetz.
</P>
<P>
   One is ``Suicide,'' a 1964 monotype on paper from the artist's
much-sought-after disaster series. It is expected to sell for
$100,000 to $150,000. Another is ``Marlon,'' a 1966 silk-screen of
Marlon Brando that carries an estimate of $1.5 million to $2
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marlon'' is ``the picture of the week,'' said Tobias Meyer,
Sotheby's worldwide director of contemporary art. ``It was last on
the market in 1968.''
</P>
<P>
   Another highlight of the sale is a Calder sculpture,
``Constellation,'' commissioned in 1943 by Philip Johnson and his
sister, Theodate Severns, for Hidden House, their Manhattan home.
Made of painted wood and wire, it is estimated to bring $600,000 to
$800,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Philip Johnson undoubtedly has the best eye in the second half
of the 20th century,'' Meyer said. ``This is the most sophisticated
of the artist's constellation series.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been tough getting good property like the Calder,'' he
added. ``One of the biggest problems is that when something good
comes on the market, it is immediately sold because the demand for
top-quality art is so high and these days it is so rare.''

BREAKING A TABOO, PENNSYLVANIA WILL OFFER STIPENDS FOR ORGAN
DONATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With demand for human organs far outstripping
supply, and more than 64,000 Americans waiting to receive new
hearts, lungs, livers, pancreases and kidneys, Pennsylvania is
planning to become the first state in the nation to break a
long-held taboo against providing a financial reward for organ
donation.
</P>
<P>
   By early next year, state officials said this week, they will
begin offering a stipend of about $300 to help families of organ
donors cover their funeral expenses. The stipend will be paid to
funeral homes and not directly to relatives under a pilot project
that will be monitored for three years by a panel of medical
ethicists to see if it increases organ donations.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the program will be released next month, but it has
drawn scrutiny from federal health officials, who say the payments
may violate the National Organ Transplant Act, a 1984 law that
classifies human organs as a national resource and prohibits their
sale. And the plan is generating intense controversy among
transplant surgeons, organ recipients and families of past donors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is absolutely not buying and selling organs,'' said
Howard Nathan, president of the Gift of Life Donor Program, one of
two regional networks that distribute donated organs in
Pennsylvania. ``This is about having a voluntary death benefit for
a family who gave a gift. The intent is to test it and see if it
makes a difference to families.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Federal Health Resources and Services Administration,
which oversees the nation's transplant programs, is not so certain.
``The Federal statute is fairly clear in prohibiting the exchange
of organs for any kind of payment,'' said Jon Nelson, who directs
the agency's office of special programs. ``The question is whether
this is in violation of the statute or not. Clearly, we have to
look at it closely.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the payments are legal, critics say they raise
questions: Will the promise of a stipend, however small, induce
families to lie about the medical histories of their loved ones,
withholding information that could affect the health of the
transplant recipient?
</P>
<P>
   Will the money prompt a disproportionate increase in donation
among the poor, injecting further economic imbalance into a system
that is already skewed in favor of the wealthy? Will the plan
backfire, hindering organ donation by offending families who
believe their gift is tainted by payments?
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, in an era when surgeons are routinely
transplanting kidneys from living donors who are not related to the
recipients, could the stipends mark the first step on the road
toward outright sale of organs?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is very murky ground to get into when we put a
monetary incentive for such an altruistic gift as organ donation,''
said Antonio Benedi, a liver recipient and past president of
Transplant Recipients' International Organization, a nonprofit
group in Washington. ``Obviously there are some folks that need
help as far as funerals go, but to attach it to the actual
donation, I think, is very dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Some transplant surgeons echo his view. ``Society is not
prepared to allow for your body to be bought and sold,'' said Dr.
Francis L. Delmonico, director of the kidney transplant program at
the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Delmonico is also
medical director of the New England Organ Bank, the nation's oldest
organ procurement agency, and while that organization has not taken
a position on the stipend, he felt compelled to offer his personal
views.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a fundamental objection to compensating
families,'' he said. But, noting that organs are sold on the black
market in some nations, he said he worries that ``this would be a
slippery slope toward the buying and selling of organs, which is
federally prohibited.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet transplant surgeons and organ procurement directors across
the nation are watching Pennsylvania's experiment closely, and some
are already laying plans to follow it if it proves successful in
increasing donations. In a report issued last year, the New York
Task Force to Increase Organ and Tissue Donation recommended to the
Department of Health a plan for funeral expense reimbursement that
``might be modeled after the Pennsylvania approach, after
evaluation of Pennsylvania's experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of paying donor families is not new; it has been
debated in transplant circles for about a decade. In 1991, the
National Kidney Foundation staged a series of town hall meetings to
discuss the idea; the next year, the foundation paid for a
telephone poll that found 48 percent of people favored some form of
financial compensation to the families of organ donors, 42 percent
opposed it and 10 percent were undecided.

</P>
<P>
   ``Our position is that this should be tested to see whether it
serves a purpose,'' said Dolph Chianchiano, the group's director of
scientific and public policy. ``We are not talking about a
situation where the organ goes to the highest bidder, or that there
should be a market for organs. We are talking about a limited,
specified amount of money paid to a third party.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, others are adopting that view, said Dr. Charles
Miller, a transplant surgeon at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New
York City. Miller, who was the chairman of the New York Task force,
said the concept of payments has been so controversial that, for
years, ``people were scared to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Miller said: ``I think times have changed. I think the
organ donor shortage has become so public and so critical that
people are beginning to rethink.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   That there is a shortage at all is testimony to the success of
transplant surgery. As recently as 1990, for instance, there were
50 liver transplant centers in the country; today there are 120. As
more doctors learn how to transplant organs, more patients demand
organ transplants. According to the Department of Health and Human
Services, 56,716 people were waiting for hearts, lungs, livers,
pancreases and kidneys at the end of 1997; by the end of last year,
the list had grown to 64,423.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, sensing the growing crisis, lawmakers in Pennsylvania
adopted Pennsylvania Act 102. It required, among other things, that
hospitals notify organ procurement agencies of every death, a
provision that has since been put into place nationwide by the
federal government as a regulation adopted by the Department of
Health and Human Service.
</P>
<P>
   The Pennsylvania law allowed residents to donate a small sum
from their tax return and motor vehicle registration fees to a
trust fund for the organ program.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, 10 percent of the fund may be used to reimburse
families for medical or funeral expenses, at a maximum of $3,000 to
any one family, according to Emilie Tierney of the Pennsylvania
Department of Health. But a state study group, which is expected to
make its final recommendation to Gov. Tom Ridge, a Republican, on
June 9, has determined the reimbursement should be much less, about
$300 per family, she said. The Governor is expected to move forward
with the program, Tierney said.
</P>
<P>
   Experts have been trying for years to understand why people
refuse to donate organs. They say religious beliefs, the attitudes
of doctors and nurses, and the sensitivity of representatives of
organ procurement agencies, who put the delicate question to family
members after their loved ones have died, all play a part. But
nobody knows if a stipend will make a difference, because it has
never been tried. As a result, the Pennsylvania pilot project will
be tracked by medical ethicists, who will interview families to
determine if the reimbursements have any effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very controversial, whether a voluntary benefit will
change donation or not,'' said one of the ethicists, Dr. Bob Arnold
of the University of Pittsburgh. ``My hypothesis, and it is merely
a hypothesis, is that families may feel as if they are doing this
out of altruism, and that any kind of benefit makes the giving feel
less altruistic. But in fact, I don't know.''

massacre in Slovinje, in Yugoslavia's Kosovo province, after
arriving at a refugee camp earlier this week. When the bloodletting
began in Kosovo, the Serbs of Slovinje told their ethnic Albanian
neighbors they had nothing to fear from the marauding army or
paramilitary. Last Friday, two mass graves were dug up in Slovinje.

HOW PAGERS RECEIVE MESSAGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the digital culture of the late '90s, being out of reach is
the ultimate faux pas; people have come to expect instant access
not only to information but also to one another.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, business cards are overflowing with addresses and
numbers for snail mail, telephones, cellular phones, Web sites,
e-mail and, of course, pagers. Approximately 155 million portable
electronic paging devices are keeping people connected worldwide.
Cellular phones seem not to have bitten into the growing use of
pagers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over half our customers have cell phones, but they enjoy being
able to leave their cell phone off,'' said Scott Hamilton, vice
president for investor relations at Skytel, one of the more
extensive paging networks. ``With a pager, they can receive
notification and choose how or when to contact someone back.''
</P>
<P>
   If humans are to become cyborgs one day, then the ubiquity of
pagers represents some kind of evolutionary step. It's the next
best thing to having a tracking chip soldered into your skull.
Thanks to an elaborate network of transmitters, receivers and
satellites, you can almost always be found if you wear a pager.
</P>
<P>
   This technology has been decades in the making. When pagers
first appeared, in the early 1970s, they were designed for
receiving messages within a city. To reach someone, a caller had to
dial a number and tap in a numeric message. The person receiving
the message was notified by a beep and had to call in to get the
information. Not very efficient.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, Mobile Communications Corp. of America
introduced alphanumeric paging. Problem was, it didn't represent a
direct channel of communication; an operator had to take the call,
type in the message and send it on its way.
</P>
<P>
   Today, such methods seem as antiquated as Morse code. Paging
culture is no longer limited to corporate executives with clunky
black boxes. Parents use pagers to keep in touch with baby sitters;
doctors use them to track patients; high school students use them
to make dates. (According to a recent poll by Motorola, one of the
largest manufacturers of paging devices, 15 percent of the nation's
teen-agers use pagers.)
</P>
<P>
   Pagers may have nearly as many uses as users. New systems allow
callers to send voice messages (which can be converted into text),
alphanumeric commands, faxes or e-mail. When someone calls a paging
number, that code tags the message for delivery, dictating its path
of satellite uplinks, downlinks, radio transmitters and receivers.
</P>
<P>
   But reliance upon wireless and satellite networks can lead to
vulnerability. In May 1998, the Galaxy 4 satellite temporarily lost
control and orientation. Fortunately, a redundant system rescued
most of the pagers' messages.
</P>
<P>
   Pager companies are continually adding new features, like
``reflex'' technology, which allows two-way communication. Instead
of just sending someone a message and hoping that it is received, a
sender can immediately get a response from the person with the
pager.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, at Skytel, said that compared with the previous year,
the number of subscribers with such advanced messaging had grown by
more than 170 percent in the past year while the number of one-way
subscribers had increased by only 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Advanced messaging also allows customers to retrieve messages
and information on the Internet. Skytel reports that the number of
Internet messages has grown in the past two years to 5.2 million
from 500,000 per month. The Weather Channel, MSNBC and Golf
magazine are among the companies providing news and information for
paging units.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, the data flow in only one direction _ you can
receive information from the Net but you cannot go online and surf
for it. Innovations like reflex technology are aimed at freeing up
cluttered gadget bags.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting to look like something out of the Mexican
Revolution,'' said Jim Page, vice president of business development
for flex technologies at Motorola. ``Techno-weenies don't want to
carry that many products.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Page said that pagers were unlikely to morph into
all-in-one units to replace, say, laptops. They are more likely to
streamline the ways in which they communicate with other devices
instead.
</P>
<P>
   But all this networking comes with one unavoidable consequence:
the easier it becomes to get in touch, the harder it is to get
away.

`HMM, THIS BOOK MIGHT MAKE A GOOD MOVIE' 
</HEADLINE>
 WARS-BOOK-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
  
EDITOR'S NOTE: What if someone got lost in space 25 years ago and
had never heard of ``Star Wars?'' We asked reporter Scott Craven to
look at the novelized version of ``Episode I _ The Phantom Menace''
as though he'd never heard of the thing. Does it hold up as a book?
Would it make a decent movie? 
 
 ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace'' 
 Terry Brooks (Ballantine, $25) 
  
  
 By SCOTT CRAVEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - It is a bit presumptuous to write a book titled
``Episode I,'' assuming sales and popularity will dictate a
continuation of the story.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Brooks, an accomplished writer in the genre, manages to
pull it off, making ``Episode I _ The Phantom Menace'' an engaging
read perfect for a summer afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The book does not hide the fact that it is based on a movie
script written by George Lucas, director of ``American Graffiti.''
Brooks' novel certainly lends itself to the screen, though likely
as an animated feature because of the complexity of the special
effects that would be involved.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks' active writing style moves the action swiftly,
fast-forwarding the reader between rare lulls of character
interaction. The blast of lasers fill every page, and as soon as
someone settles in for some quiet insight, it's quickly broken up
by explosions and swordplay.
</P>
<P>
   And not just any kind of sword but one with a blade of energy so
powerful it can melt a steel door. You can guess what it can do to
organic matter (and does, as Brooks isn't afraid to shed any
literary blood).
</P>
<P>
   These so-called ``lightsabers'' are wielded by a quasi-religious
band of fanatics calling themselves the Jedi. Seems this ancient
sect, whose origins are conveniently lost in the mists of time,
have the power of ``the Force,'' which is in all living things
(even among those who do not carry a lightsaber).
</P>
<P>
   Rather than being mystical, the Force is biological. Bodies (and
perhaps trees, if the Force occupies everything organic) contain
midi-chlorians, microscopic symbionts that give those with high
concentrations the power, among other things, to run faster, jump
higher and move objects telekinetically, like an athletic Uri
Geller.
</P>
<P>
   Like the knights of Camelot, the Jedi are sworn to uphold the
laws of the Republic, sort of a U.N. for planets. The Republic is
threatened when the Trade Federation, a powerful association of
merchants, protests taxation by blockading Naboo, a peaceful planet
ruled by young Queen Amidala.
</P>
<P>
   A Jedi Master (Qui-Gon Jinn) and his apprentice (Obi-Wan Kenobi)
are dispatched to negotiate with the Federation, only to discover
that it is part of a larger plot to destroy the Republic.
</P>
<P>
   What follows are 250 pages of epic battles, intricate
hand-to-hand fights and narrow escapes, the perfect blueprint for
the kind of action-packed serial not seen since the 1950s. The tale
follows (``chases'' is a better term) the Jedis as they rescue the
queen from an army of murderous robots (battle and destroyer
``droids''). Their ship is crippled in a brief battle, and the crew
is forced to land on Tatooine, a barren planet home to all sorts of
nefarious creatures.
</P>
<P>
   There they meet Anakin Skywalker, a 9-year-old slave who has a
talent with all things mechanical. He also happens to be the only
human pod racer, a sport in which jet-powered vehicles race among
deserts and canyons in a way that is perfect fodder for a computer
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Annie,'' as he is called by his mom and friends, also happens
to have a lot of these midi-chlorians, which attracts the interest
of Jinn, who thinks the boy is destined for great things. Together,
they return to Naboo for the final showdown, not only to fight the
Federation, but an evil ``Sith Lord,'' whose midi-chlorians have
run afoul and thus practices a dark side of the Force and is intent
to destroy the heroes.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks at times throws in characters, cities and planets with
little description or explanation, as if assuming the reader has a
prior knowledge of this universe.
</P>
<P>
   The ending leaves many unanswered questions and begs a sequel
(certainly to happen if the book is a success). This is an
established pattern for Brooks, who typically writes series (such
as the Shannara and Magic Kingdom of Landover books). The title
even suggests a follow-up, since one cannot expect an Episode I not
to be followed by and Episode II or even III.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks doesn't allow room for characters to grow beyond mere
extensions of their weapons. But clearly, that is his intent,
appealing to lovers of Westerns, swashbucklers and similar fare. No
doubt if the movie is made, it could well spawn a cross-marketing
treasure of toys and trinkets.
</P>
<P>
   Curious, though, is that ``Episode I _ The Phantom Menace'' has
been published with four dust jackets, each featuring a different
character. One book would suffice for most readers, though big
Brooks fans may want to collect them all should the book become as
popular as, say, anything written by John Grisham or Stephen King. &QL;

expected to veto the bill, that doesn't mean Missouri won't end up
with a ban on ``infanticide,'' the term that would apply to
partial-birth abortions under the law. Last year, the legislature
came within one vote of overriding the veto. This year, with a more

REGIONAL ELECTIONS MARK SHIFT TOWARD DECENTRALIZATION OF POWER IN
BRITAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDINBURGH, Scotland _ The Scots will be voting for their first
Parliament since 1707. The Welsh will be electing the first one
they have ever had. And Prime Minister Tony Blair will be looking
for validation of his two-year-old government's transformation of
how the British run themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The elections of members of the two new legislatures and of 362
councils across Britain on Thursday are being called the most
important midterm balloting in the country's history. In addition
to providing the traditional barometer of a government, this year's
elections confirm Britain's move to decentralize political
authority.
</P>
<P>
   It is an undertaking central to Blair's program of what he calls
radical reform for Britain, and one that is being eyed with
interest elsewhere in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't put all this at risk,'' Blair said in outlining what he
said were his government's achievements and calling for a big
turnout in a televised campaign address on Tuesday night, an event
that is itself rare in British local elections.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, election day has been called ``Super Thursday.''
More than 12,000 councillors, 129 members of the Scottish
Parliament and 60 members of the National Assembly of Wales are to
be elected.
</P>
<P>
   While Blair has been eager to portray the vote as a referendum
on national issues _ an arena where opinion polls show his party
with far greater voter appeal than his dispirited Conservative
opponents _ the races often turn on local concerns beyond the reach
of a popular national leader's coattails.
</P>
<P>
   And nowhere has that been truer than here, where the Scottish
Nationalist Party, which proposes full independence for Scotland,
turned long-held local resentment of rule from London into early
campaign success that provoked predictions of the imminent breakup
of the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Labor appears to have recaptured the lead from the Scottish
Nationalists and will probably end up controlling the Parliament
either by itself or in coalition with the centrist Liberal
Democrats. If such an arrangement emerges, that would mark another
first in British politics arising out of this election.
</P>
<P>
   Also precedent-setting for Britain is the use of
Continental-style proportional representation. After they have
submitted their first ballot for a candidate from their own
district, voters will be asked to cast a second ballot for a
candidate from a party list.
</P>
<P>
   One early consequence will be a more complicated tabulation,
which will delay knowledge of the full results of the elections
until Friday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Running 15 points ahead of Labor in opinion polls during the
summer, the Scottish Nationalists stumbled badly over two gaffes by
their leader, Alex Salmond, a former bank oil analyst with a good
grasp of political economics, a wry sense of humor and a talent for
tweaking the English that was unfailing until this campaign.
</P>
<P>
   His first mistake was to propose increasing taxes on Scots, a
move that overestimated the traditional Scottish faith in state
social services and willingness to ante up for them.
</P>
<P>
   The second was to assail the air raids on Yugoslavia as
``imponderable folly'' in the early days of NATO's attacks, a
statement that neglected local pride in the Scots' reputation for
being Britain's most courageous and accomplished fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Cook, the foreign secretary, who is also a Scot,
excoriated Salmond the next day as ``sure to be the toast of
Belgrade'' and questioned his credentials for leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Blair came to Scotland to say that what the Nationalists were
talking about was not independence but separatism. He argued that
there were no grounds for Scotland to be seeking a divorce from the
rest of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The Salmond episodes left the impression that the Nationalists
were in over their depth in national and international politics,
and the poll numbers swung away from them in favor of Labor. Blair
exploited the lapses by putting the campaign here under the
direction of the most powerful member of his Cabinet and the most
formidable politician from Scotland, Chancellor of the Exchequer
Gordon Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The Nationalists countered with an impassioned speech from Sean
Connery, the Scottish actor. But the effect of his visit was
diminished by press ridicule of him as a hypocrite for proclaiming
independence for a country that he himself will not live in.
Connery has homes in the Bahamas and Marbella on Spain's
Mediterranean coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Devolution,'' the name by which the move to allocate more
power to the various parts of the United Kingdom goes, now appears
to be on course, with its backers expected to emerge in control of
the legislatures here and in Cardiff, Wales, where the nationalist
party, Plaid Cymru (pronounced plyde KUM-ry), is running behind
Labor.
</P>
<P>
   Devolution was a principal plank in Blair's campaign platform,
and he moved quickly once in office to hold referendums in Scotland
and Wales to gain local approval for setting up the two
legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   Scotland, with its distinct sense of nationhood and separate
legal and educational systems, voted yes overwhelmingly. Wales,
where national identity is more elusive, passed the measure by only
a fraction of a percent. Unlike the Scottish Nationalists, Plaid
Cymru is not an independence party.
</P>
<P>
   The new regional governments will have authority over local
government, health, education, transportation, the environment and
culture. The Scottish Parliament will have tax-setting and
law-making powers, though the Welsh National Assembly will not. The
British Parliament will continue to control defense and foreign
policy, taxation and social security.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Blair program, London will get its first popularly
elected mayor and an assembly later this year, and regions of
England in the middle and north of the country will be encouraged
to think of future local governments for their areas.
</P>
<P>
   Keen interest in the outcome here has been expressed by
politicians in France, Germany, Belgium, Italy and Spain, all
countries testing their own formulas for granting restive parts of
their countries autonomous freedoms from traditional central
authority that stop short of full independence.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionalists in Britain have expressed fear over the
consequences of passing out power to the country's regions, but on
the eve of the balloting, more hopeful notes were sounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``If devolution works, it will suggest that Britain's
traditional gift for creating political stability through
moderation and pragmatism still exists,'' said an editorial in The
Economist's current issue. ``And if gloomy predictions of `the
breakup of Britain' prove to be ill-founded, the notion of
Britishness could well emerge strengthened by a proven ability to
accommodate diverse national cultures and new centers of power.''

MARKET PLACE: LONG-TERM OUTLOOK FOR BRAZIL IS CALLED BRIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It may appear to many investors that the sharp rebound in
Brazilian stocks and bonds has passed them by. The stock market, in
local terms, is up 71 percent this year and is almost back to its
last peak in March 1998. Prices in the bond market have jumped, as
the yields, which move in the opposite direction, have plunged. The
yield on Brazil's benchmark long-term bond maturing in 2027 is down
to 12.6 percent, from 16.9 percent just two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and money managers, though, say there is still much
more to make on a investment in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are betting on interest rates falling, the currency
stabilizing and inflation not being a threat,'' said Jay Pelosky,
the global emerging-markets strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, who recommended a move back into Brazil in mid-March.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks the bet will prove to be a smart one. He even thinks
the Brazilian economy will surprise this year by declining much
less than expected. In the last few weeks, Brazilian officials have
cut their forecasts of the decline to 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Though Pelosky thinks Brazil is a good bet in the longer-term,
he warns that the stock market is in a pause right now. All the
good news about Brazil's unexpected escape from disaster is, as
they say on Wall Street, in the market. Since reaching a high for
the year of 11,529.92 on April 7, the Bovespa index of 57 Brazilian
stocks has settled into a narrow trading range.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today you need new confirmation for Brazil to go appreciably
higher,'' Pelosky said. With good earnings news not expected for
some months and the economy still declining, that confirmation make
take some time.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is Brazil's congressional investigation
concerning the central bank's role in the bailout of two small
investment banks earlier this year. If it gets more serious, the
inquiry could distract the Brazilian Congress from completing
important structural changes that are aimed at ensuring Brazil's
long-term economic health.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosky also cautions American investors not to bet on a rebound
in the Brazilian currency, the real, to profit from an investment
there. Such a bet might look attractive. While the Bovespa has
surged, in dollar terms the index is still 57 percent below its
March 1998 highs.
</P>
<P>
   The real declined by as much as 44 percent in value after the
government abandoned foreign-exchange controls on the currency in
mid-January. But since early March it has rallied by 28 percent and
is now valued at 1.683 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosky does not think that it will rally much more in the near
term because several more months are needed for foreign investors
to be convinced that important benchmarks, like the size of the
government budget deficit, are moving in the right direction. Data
for April, which would give three full months of performance since
the devaluation, will not be available until June. Ernest Brown,
the chief Latin American economist at Morgan Stanley, forecasts
that the real will only strengthen another 3 percent by year-end.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Beneat, the portfolio manager of the new and tiny Dreyfus
Premier Emerging Markets Fund, cut his exposure to Brazil several
weeks ago because he thought that the good run since January was
going to end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout the summer we are going to have some pretty bad
numbers,'' he said, referring to data showing that the economy is
still in a decline. ``The environment will not be that positive.''
</P>
<P>
   While he cut back in Brazil, he increased his holdings in
Mexican stocks. ``The earnings are very good and the valuations are
very cheap there,'' he said. ``Mexico will outperform Brazil in the
coming months.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the economy turns, he said, he will return to Brazil,
picking up more of the utility and telecommunications stocks he
already likes, including Tele Centro Sul Participacoes, the local
telecommunications company which has jumped 58 percent since the
devaluation, and Companhia Paranaense de Energia-Copel, a large
utility, which is up 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have a view on Brazil,'' argued Arturo
Porzecanski, chief economist for the Americas at ING Barings. But
he thinks that the bond market, for now, may be a better bet. ``If
you are an equity investor you have to wait for earnings to come
back'' and that means waiting for the economy to recover.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds, he said, are more a bet ``on a perception of risk.'' And
with a further decline in interest rates, that risk will be
lessening before the economy turns. Last week, the central bank
made its fourth interest rate cut in five weeks. The benchmark rate
was trimmed to 32 percent from 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said there is room for bond yields to fall
further, when compared to history and the yields in the rest of
Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   According to a J.P. Morgan index that tracks the difference
between Latin American yields and comparable U.S. Treasury
securities, the spread for Brazilian debt is 8.82 percentage
points, 5.98 percentage points for Argentina and 5.48 percentage
points for Mexico. In addition, while the Brazilian spread has
fallen from a 1999 high of 17.79 percentage points Jan. 14, it is
still more than the 6.08 percent on July 31 last year, just before
Russia devalued its ruble and defaulted on its debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is the opportunity to buy,'' said Porzecanski.
But he made sure to add the qualifier always invoked when
discussing emerging markets _ ``for the long-term investor.''

DESPITE DROP IN SUPPORT, MORDECHAI VOWS TO STAY IN RACE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Yitzhak Mordechai, the Center Party candidate for
prime minister, is facing increasing pressure from inside and
outside his party to drop out of the race and join forces with Ehud
Barak, the Labor Party leader and front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   But Mordechai, a candidate who was born by the polls, refuses to
die by them, even though they show his support plummeting; he is
now at less than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Center Party is strong,'' Mordechai, the former defense
minister, said Wednesday as he emerged from an all-day huddle with
his running mates and advisers. ``I am continuing to run for prime
minister, and we will meet again on May 18,'' the day after ballots
are cast.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve days before the election, the logic of Mordechai's
candidacy is fading. His slogan _ ``Only Mordechai can win big''
against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu _ does not stand up to
the evidence that his constituency is ebbing away. Former army
colleagues traveled to his home last weekend to beg him to step
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing the man, he will never give up,'' Maozia Segal, a
close friend and a Center Party candidate for Parliament, said.
``He is going all the way. Take my word for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The party was created in the winter to break what its leaders
saw as a stalemate between the two main parties, Barak's Labor and
Netanyahu's Likud, which command tribal loyalties from their
partisans. Its four leaders were united chiefly by their desire to
oust Netanyahu. They said they did not think that Barak was able to
do that.
</P>
<P>
   But Barak, a highly decorated former general, has cobbled
together a coalition that incorporates moderate religious and
Sephardic leaders into his base at the Labor Party, which
represents the Ashkenazi elite. And he is running about 8
percentage points ahead of Netanyahu, although many voters say they
remain undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Center Party leaders, Mordechai, who is gruff,
straightforward and extremely well liked, was the most popular. He
was chosen to represent the party because he outscored Amnon
Lipkin-Shahak, another former general and now second in the polls.
The party was mocked for its reliance on poll takers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, the polls have turned against them, and Mordechai
has taken to discounting their reliability. The most recent show
him trailing Barak and Netanyahu in the first round of voting with
5 to 7 percent of the vote, down from 17 in March. In a runoff,
where polls had shown him trouncing Netanyahu in a one-on-one race,
some now find him barely ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a snowball effect at this point,'' a political scientist,
Yaron Ezrahi, said. ``Once he's headed downhill like this, he
cannot be rescued, especially since he has no secret supply of
charisma.''
</P>
<P>
   Some polls, whose results were faxed to news organizations by
the Labor Party, found that if Mordechai were to quit the race,
Barak would win a significant victory over Netanyahu in the first
round of voting.
</P>
<P>
   It is a five-way race for prime minister, with Benny Begin, a
right-wing candidate, taking votes from Netanyahu and Azmi Bishara,
an Israeli Arab member of Parliament, taking part of the Arab vote
from Barak.
</P>
<P>
   If Mordechai were to drop out, Bishara said he might, too. That
could give Barak more than 50 percent of the vote, which a
candidate needs to win outright. Any percentage short of that would
push the top two vote-getters into a runoff on June 1.
</P>
<P>
   A top-ranking member of the Labor Party, Yossi Beilin, said
Mordechai was ``forcing a second round on the electorate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The dream has faded, and it should disappear before the
elections,'' Beilin wrote in an Op-Ed article in The Jerusalem
Post. ``It would be much more respectable for Mordechai to admit
this and join forces with the camp which will replace Netanyahu
than trying to prove to Netanyahu what a man he is.''
</P>
<P>
   In the one triumphant moment of his campaign, Mordechai, who is
not known for his way with words, out-talked Netanyahu, who is
considered a media wizard, in a televised debate a few weeks ago.
Although that tarnished Netanyahu's image as unflappable, the
debate did not improve Mordechai's standing in the long term.
</P>
<P>
   And in the debate, Netanyahu coaxed from him a promise _ not to
withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu sees an advantage in prolonging the race, apparently
believing that he will have an easier time having his voters to
show up at the polls twice.
</P>
<P>
   An Iraqi-born Kurdish Jew, Mordechai is the first Sephardic
candidate for prime minister, and many found his candidacy moving
because of the barrier it broke. When Mordechai campaigns, he
encounters many Israelis with deep feelings for him, and that has
led him to believe that the polls must not be accurate.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, though, he met with such hostility among religious
Sephardim that he had to leave an event at the suggestion of a
police commander. At Mount Meron in the Galilee, where religious
Jews were gathering at the grave of a rabbi, scores of
ultra-Orthodox men chanted Netanyahu's name and threw plastic bags
of water at Mordechai.
</P>
<P>
   He was whisked away in the center of a circle of police
officers.
</P>
<P>
   Mordechai has faulted the Labor Party for starting rumors that
he was contemplating withdrawal. The Israeli press is rife with
quotes from unidentified high-level associates of Mordechai saying
they cannot persuade him to throw in the towel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mordechai is determined not to pull out,'' a senior political
correspondent for Israel Radio, Yaron Dekel, said Wednesday night.
``But to call that the opinion of all party members would be a
mistake.''

<P>
   There are men who are similar to cities; like Baudelaire and
Marcel Proust to Paris, or Charles Dickens to London; there are
cities that really do exist, but which are, above all, literary
cities such as the Dublin that James Joyce narrated in ``Ulysses.''
</P>
<P>
   And there are countries that can be reflected in cities which at
first sight have nothing to do with them. You place the city in
front of a mirror and suddenly the country just appears. That's
what happens with Austin, the capital of Texas. In a secret,
subliminal sort of way, that city is Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   The similarity probably began in September 1961, when Jorge Luis
Borges was invited by the University of Texas to give a poetry
seminar.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Buenos Aires in 1899, Borges found Austin in the
pre-high-tech industry days. The city had a pleasant atmosphere and
its most prominent architectural structure was probably the (now
restored) provincial Capitol Building dome. Borges was surprised by
the vast prairies that smelled of siestas and grilled meat, the
puddles, the stray dogs, all of which he thought inappropriate for
what he had imagined to be the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he thought it strange that butchers and trench diggers
knew how to speak English. ``I always,'' he tells us in his
autobiography, ``thought that English was a language denied to that
class of people.''
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoons, students would see him walking on Guadalupe
Street, arm in arm with a haughty woman, thought to be his wife:
``Mrs. Borges.'' Actually she was his widowed mother, Leonor
Acevedo, who at age 85 looked 60. As Borges became progressively
blind in his later years, she was frequently his travel companion
and read to him aloud.
</P>
<P>
   One employee at the Benson Library, amid the rare books, says
she still remembers them immersed in reading Alfonso Reyes' and
Atilio Chiappori's manuscripts. ``She,'' the librarian states,
``would help him with the reading, whispering at his ear in a very
hushed tone.''
</P>
<P>
   Borges' mom surpassed him in agility, energy and passion for
life. One morning they stopped at the library windows and observed
some original editions of Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz, the fiery
17th-century Mexican poet, along with her handwritten documents.
The mother stubbornly insisted on taking a closer look. Sor Juana,
revered as a feminist, had chosen for 30 years to be a nun, the
only station in which a woman then was allowed to read and write.
</P>
<P>
   The manuscript, partially blurred and discolored, was a page
torn out of a book of confessions of the Convent of San Jeronimo,
in which Sor Juana asks forgiveness for her sins and signs in
blood: ``I, the worst in this world.''
</P>
<P>
   Pointing out that the blood strokes had almost vanished with the
passage of time, while the rest of the writing remained intact,
Borges' mother later observed: ``This definitely proves what
`Georgie' always said. Blood is thinner than ink.''
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Austin, Borges had managed to scandalize a group
of American admirers with an array of politically incorrect
opinions _ on blacks, Texas music (a mix of ``country'' and
``mariachi'') and the usurpation of Mexican lands by Texas and
California, which he considered a blessing.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't there for the arrival of the bats. Austin is traversed
by the lazy Colorado River, which flows southward into the Gulf of
Mexico. The swampy surrounding lands were perfect breeding grounds
for mosquitoes. About 100,000 bats had migrated from Mexico and
settled under the Congress Avenue Bridge, whose concrete rafters
formed recesses like the niches of a honeycomb. When the cold
season came, the bats left, but they returned the following May,
reaching more than 200,000-strong, and because the females were
impregnated, the population soon doubled.
</P>
<P>
   By now the bats have become Austin's symbol; each day they
devour tons of mosquitoes and keep the air clean. At night, when
one nears the bridge, the harsh smell of the bat colonies clustered
there and their incessant shrieks are enough to drill through your
senses and your brain.
</P>
<P>
   A local group, Friends of the Bats, recently tried with no luck
to acquire manuscripts in which Borges wrote about Austin to
anthologize for this year's celebration of the Borges' centennial.
</P>
<P>
   Recently I attended one of the university's anniversary
celebrations. I was escorted to the modest student residence where
Borges first roamed as well as to the proud Victorian hotel where
he lodged later. My guide was another survivor of those times,
Professor Carter Wheelock, whose Spanish was so clear and
unadulterated that nobody would guess he had learned it.
</P>
<P>
   Wheelock also has a Borgean memory: He can recite 3,183 verses
from Beowolf, the famous Anglo-Saxon poem, with the same courteous,
unassuming intonation that he picked up from Borges decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   The professor told me that Borges and his mother arrived in
Austin on Sept. 7, 1961, on a plane from Miami. Six or seven
colleagues had gone to meet him, but Borges was not there. Five
days later, when they were just about to file a police missing
person's report, Borges and his mother arrived at the university,
elated. They had decided to take a bus trip through the Deep South:
Tallahassee, Biloxi, New Orleans, Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Borges,'' Wheelock continued, ``wanted to smell what he
couldn't see.''
</P>
<P>
   In the prairies of Austin, where almost nothing ever occurs,
everything seemed to happen to Borges. In July 1966, a bit before
one of his trips, a mentally disturbed college junior named Charles
Whitman, 24, had killed his wife and mother and then secured
himself, with a cache of rifles and shotguns, in the 27-story
university clocktower. For an hour, he shot at passers-by.
</P>
<P>
   A precise, telescopic police sniper eventually took Whitman out,
but not before he had hit 46 people and killed 16. When Borges
returned the following spring, on his way from Harvard, he asked
Wheelock to take him to the tower and show him where Whitman had
died. They climbed 27 floors and came to the small wooden balcony,
where the shadow of blood still remained.
</P>
<P>
   Borges bent over, just like his character in ``The Aleph,'' and
remained silent for several long minutes, his imagination fixed on
some spot in the universe _ ``a point which only he could see,'' as
Wheelock puts it _ and then asked to be helped down.
</P>
<P>
   On the descent, which was slower than the climb up, Borges said
nothing. He didn't speak for the entire afternoon, night or the
next day _ Borges, whose fiction was so well able to encapsulate
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   A country is not only its geography and history, or its everyday
tragedies and celebrations; a country is not only its politicians.
It is also (and sometimes above all), its memory. Santiago de Chile
was the Argentina of 1845, when Sarmiento was there and wrote
``Facundo''; and Paris was the Argentina of 1962, when Cortazar
wrote ``Facundo''; and Paris was the Argentina of 1962, when
Cortazar wrote ``Rayuela'' on the same sheets of paper that are now
in the Benson Library.
</P>
<P>
   Austin is also Argentina, yesterday and today; you can still see
Borges on Guadelupe Street, taking a stroll with his blind-man's
walking stick and reciting Beowulf, while the newly arrived
immigrants dig ditches, except that now they no longer speak
English. The language they speak is a Spanish that Borges may not
even understand.

   There are men who are similar to cities; like Baudelaire and
Marcel Proust to Paris, or Charles Dickens to London; there are
cities that really do exist, but which are, above all, literary
cities such as the Dublin that James Joyce narrated in ``Ulysses.''
</P>
<P>
   And there are countries that can be reflected in cities which at
first sight have nothing to do with them. You place the city in
front of a mirror and suddenly the country just appears. That's
what happens with Austin, the capital of Texas. In a secret,
subliminal sort of way, that city is Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   The similarity probably began in September 1961, when Jorge Luis
Borges was invited by the University of Texas to give a poetry
seminar.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Buenos Aires in 1899, Borges found Austin in the
pre-high-tech industry days. The city had a pleasant atmosphere and
its most prominent architectural structure was probably the (now
restored) provincial Capitol Building dome. Borges was surprised by
the vast prairies that smelled of siestas and grilled meat, the
puddles, the stray dogs, all of which he thought inappropriate for
what he had imagined to be the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he thought it strange that butchers and trench diggers
knew how to speak English. ``I always,'' he tells us in his
autobiography, ``thought that English was a language denied to that
class of people.''
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoons, students would see him walking on Guadalupe
Street, arm in arm with a haughty woman, thought to be his wife:
``Mrs. Borges.'' Actually she was his widowed mother, Leonor
Acevedo, who at age 85 looked 60. As Borges became progressively
blind in his later years, she was frequently his travel companion
and read to him aloud.
</P>
<P>
   One employee at the Benson Library, amid the rare books, says
she still remembers them immersed in reading Alfonso Reyes' and
Atilio Chiappori's manuscripts. ``She,'' the librarian states,
``would help him with the reading, whispering at his ear in a very
hushed tone.''
</P>
<P>
   Borges' mom surpassed him in agility, energy and passion for
life. One morning they stopped at the library windows and observed
some original editions of Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz, the fiery
17th-century Mexican poet, along with her handwritten documents.
The mother stubbornly insisted on taking a closer look. Sor Juana,
revered as a feminist, had chosen for 30 years to be a nun, the
only station in which a woman then was allowed to read and write.
</P>
<P>
   The manuscript, partially blurred and discolored, was a page
torn out of a book of confessions of the Convent of San Jeronimo,
in which Sor Juana asks forgiveness for her sins and signs in
blood: ``I, the worst in this world.''
</P>
<P>
   Pointing out that the blood strokes had almost vanished with the
passage of time, while the rest of the writing remained intact,
Borges' mother later observed: ``This definitely proves what
`Georgie' always said. Blood is thinner than ink.''
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Austin, Borges had managed to scandalize a group
of American admirers with an array of politically incorrect
opinions _ on blacks, Texas music (a mix of ``country'' and
``mariachi'') and the usurpation of Mexican lands by Texas and
California, which he considered a blessing.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't there for the arrival of the bats. Austin is traversed
by the lazy Colorado River, which flows southward into the Gulf of
Mexico. The swampy surrounding lands were perfect breeding grounds
for mosquitoes. About 100,000 bats had migrated from Mexico and
settled under the Congress Avenue Bridge, whose concrete rafters
formed recesses like the niches of a honeycomb. When the cold
season came, the bats left, but they returned the following May,
reaching more than 200,000-strong, and because the females were
impregnated, the population soon doubled.
</P>
<P>
   By now the bats have become Austin's symbol; each day they
devour tons of mosquitoes and keep the air clean. At night, when
one nears the bridge, the harsh smell of the bat colonies clustered
there and their incessant shrieks are enough to drill through your
senses and your brain.
</P>
<P>
   A local group, Friends of the Bats, recently tried with no luck
to acquire manuscripts in which Borges wrote about Austin to
anthologize for this year's celebration of the Borges' centennial.
</P>
<P>
   Recently I attended one of the university's anniversary
celebrations. I was escorted to the modest student residence where
Borges first roamed as well as to the proud Victorian hotel where
he lodged later. My guide was another survivor of those times,
Professor Carter Wheelock, whose Spanish was so clear and
unadulterated that nobody would guess he had learned it.
</P>
<P>
   Wheelock also has a Borgean memory: He can recite 3,183 verses
from Beowolf, the famous Anglo-Saxon poem, with the same courteous,
unassuming intonation that he picked up from Borges decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   The professor told me that Borges and his mother arrived in
Austin on Sept. 7, 1961, on a plane from Miami. Six or seven
colleagues had gone to meet him, but Borges was not there. Five
days later, when they were just about to file a police missing
person's report, Borges and his mother arrived at the university,
elated. They had decided to take a bus trip through the Deep South:
Tallahassee, Biloxi, New Orleans, Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Borges,'' Wheelock continued, ``wanted to smell what he
couldn't see.''
</P>
<P>
   In the prairies of Austin, where almost nothing ever occurs,
everything seemed to happen to Borges. In July 1966, a bit before
one of his trips, a mentally disturbed college junior named Charles
Whitman, 24, had killed his wife and mother and then secured
himself, with a cache of rifles and shotguns, in the 27-story
university clocktower. For an hour, he shot at passers-by.
</P>
<P>
   A precise, telescopic police sniper eventually took Whitman out,
but not before he had hit 46 people and killed 16. When Borges
returned the following spring, on his way from Harvard, he asked
Wheelock to take him to the tower and show him where Whitman had
died. They climbed 27 floors and came to the small wooden balcony,
where the shadow of blood still remained.
</P>
<P>
   Borges bent over, just like his character in ``The Aleph,'' and
remained silent for several long minutes, his imagination fixed on
some spot in the universe _ ``a point which only he could see,'' as
Wheelock puts it _ and then asked to be helped down.
</P>
<P>
   On the descent, which was slower than the climb up, Borges said
nothing. He didn't speak for the entire afternoon, night or the
next day _ Borges, whose fiction was so well able to encapsulate
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   A country is not only its geography and history, or its everyday
tragedies and celebrations; a country is not only its politicians.
It is also (and sometimes above all), its memory. Santiago de Chile
was the Argentina of 1845, when Sarmiento was there and wrote
``Facundo''; and Paris was the Argentina of 1962, when Cortazar
wrote ``Facundo''; and Paris was the Argentina of 1962, when
Cortazar wrote ``Rayuela'' on the same sheets of paper that are now
in the Benson Library.
</P>
<P>
   Austin is also Argentina, yesterday and today; you can still see
Borges on Guadelupe Street, taking a stroll with his blind-man's
walking stick and reciting Beowulf, while the newly arrived
immigrants dig ditches, except that now they no longer speak
English. The language they speak is a Spanish that Borges may not
even understand.

   ``The Last Days According to Jesus''

   ``End Times''
</P>
<P>
   By John F. Walvoord
</P>
<P>
   Word, $19.97
</P>
<P>
   Not with a whimper but a bang, to reverse T.S. Eliot's famous
phrase about how the world ends _ that much R.C. Sproul and John F.
Walvoord would probably agree on. But as for what happens before
God brings down the curtain on human history _ that is where these
two theologians would differ.
</P>
<P>
   ``Debates over eschatology'' _ the academic word for the study
of the last days _ ``will probably continue until the Lord
returns,'' Sproul observes. And ``The Last Days According to
Jesus'' is his contribution to the argument that much of
evangelicalism has misread the Scriptures.
</P>
<P>
   Sproul focuses on the Olivet Discourse, a lengthy prophecy in
the Gospels that deals with Jerusalem, the temple and Jesus' coming
in glory. The Reformed writer argues for ``preterism,'' which
teaches that many New Testament prophecies that are often thought
to deal with the world's end were actually fulfilled during the
first century.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Last Days'' does a series of quick dives into topics such
as the destruction of Jerusalem, the millennium and the Antichrist,
although the arguments that Sproul investigates may leave many at
least partially unswayed. The Florida scholar's book is written
more for the serious student than the casual reader, but it
provides an accessible glimpse into territory that is unfamiliar to
many.
</P>
<P>
   Walvoord's ``End Times'' stoutly defends ``dispensational
premillennialism,'' the idea that God has dealt in various ways
with humanity throughout history and that part of the program is a
1,000-year political kingdom to be inaugurated at the Second
Coming.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Theological Seminary chancellor presents a
wide-ranging study of a system of thought that has made the
Antichrist, the millennium and the pretribulational Rapture (the
``snatching up'' of Christians before the terrible judgments of the
Great Tribulation) familiar to millions. Walvoord spends little
time on alternate interpretive schemes, although amillennialism _
which argues that the millennium is symbolic rather than literal _
comes in for criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``End Times'' is a thorough presentation of thinking that has
become orthodoxy in many conservative religious circles.

A BATTLER FOR THE NEW IN AMERICAN MUSIC  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 9) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DAVID MERMELSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a time when the New York Philharmonic celebrates George
Gershwin one season and Aaron Copland the next, it is easy to
forget that the groundbreaking music of American composers once
went unheard in concert halls.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, such scores were ultimately absorbed into the canon
largely through the efforts of one man, Serge Koussevitzky, the
first major maestro to make ``modern'' American music a priority.
</P>
<P>
   A double-bass virtuoso born in Russia, Koussevitzky led the
Boston Symphony Orchestra from 1924 to 1949 and blazed a trail for
innovative American music by not only performing new scores but
also commissioning more.
</P>
<P>
   Koussevitzky was practically hard-wired to champion new music.
First in Moscow, then in Paris, he gave premieres of works by
Scriabin, Ravel, Honegger and others, and was an intimate of
Stravinsky, Prokofiev and the great pedagogue Nadia Boulanger.
</P>
<P>
   So it was hardly surprising that when he arrived in Boston, he
brought along a dedication to the cutting edge. The Athens of New
England was not Paris, however, and Koussevitzky had to battle the
entrenched conservatism of his audiences.
</P>
<P>
   He nevertheless remained unshakable in his allegiance to
Copland, Samuel Barber, Howard Hanson, Roy Harris, William Schuman,
Walter Piston and Randall Thompson, as well as to many lesser-known
composers. And that commitment lies at the heart of two new CDs
from the Biddulph and Dutton labels.
</P>
<P>
   Devoted entirely to American works, these reissues are
inspiriting reminders of Koussevitzky's determination to lift
American music to prominence.
</P>
<P>
   The Biddulph disk (WHL 050) is a gathering of Americana:
Copland's ``Appalachian Spring'' Suite, ``Lincoln Portrait'' and
``Salon Mexico,'' Thompson's ``Testament of Freedom'' and two
marches by John Philip Sousa. The recordings, originally issued by
RCA Victor between 1938 and 1946, have been impressively
transferred to CD by Mark Obert-Thorn.
</P>
<P>
   Koussevitzky and the Boston Symphony did not give the premiere
of the ``Appalachian Spring'' Suite, in which Copland
reorchestrated a ballet written for Martha Graham in 1944, but they
were the first to record it. This 1945 effort remains unsurpassed
for its sense of discovery.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there have been more polished recordings of the work
(Copland's own with the London Symphony Orchestra, for example, or
Leonard Bernstein's with the New York Philharmonic), yet no one has
captured the music's wide-eyed innocence and irrepressible
exuberance quite the way Koussevitzky and the Bostonians do.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``Revival Meeting'' section, they build energy
incrementally, and when they shift from a lope to a gallop, the
listener can't help bouncing along.
</P>
<P>
   Koussevitzky and the Boston Symphony were also the first to
record ``Lincoln Portrait.'' The performance dates from 1946 and
features the actor Melvyn Douglas as narrator. If ever there was an
effective exercise in American musical chauvinism, this work is it.
With its overtly sentimental melodies, deeply hewn phrases and
spoken excerpts from the 16th president's best-known speeches, it
swells the heart like a ticker tape parade.
</P>
<P>
   In the right hands and voice _ Copland's and Henry Fonda's, or
Eugene Ormandy's and Adlai Stevenson's, for instance _ the work
asserts undeniable power. But Douglas, in thrall to a melodramatic
esthetic, is too histrionic for modern tastes. He draws out the
tenderer passages and wildly declaims such famous phrases as
``shall not perish from the earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Koussevitzky and the musicians fare better, investing Copland's
score with unaffected grandeur if not utter conviction.
</P>
<P>
   The 1938 premiere recording of ``El Salon Mexico'' finds them on
surer ground. The work, written by Copland after a visit to Mexico
City in 1932, vibrates with south-of-the-border pizazz, emanating
in large part from the native folk tunes the composer integrated
into his score.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But it is Copland's brilliance as an orchestrator that
Koussevitzky and the Boston Symphony emphasize in their reading.
Never has the E flat clarinet in this work sounded more out of
kilter, or the trumpet more defiant.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Lincoln Portrait,'' Thompson's ``Testament of Freedom''
incorporates the words of a great president, in this case Thomas
Jefferson. But rather than leave the ennobling lines to a single
speaker, Thompson scored his work for chorus, originally
accompanied by piano. He later enriched the piece with an
orchestration, and in 1945 Koussevitzky and the Boston Symphony
joined the Harvard Glee Club to record it.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative in conception, Thompson's ``Testament'' recalls a
Victorian oratorio overflowing with persuasive gravity. Despite the
orchestra's fine contribution, the college glee club earns the
laurels here, its enunciation crisp, its ardor palpable.
</P>
<P>
   The disk concludes with Sousa's ``Semper Fidelis'' and ``Stars
and Stripes Forever.'' Some may think it odd that the Boston
Symphony's high-minded music director would tackle such light fare,
but Koussevitzky clearly relishes the energy of these marches,
savoring in particular the clipped rhythms of ``The Stars and
Stripes Forever.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dutton disk (CDEA 5021) also opens with the ``Appalachian
Spring'' Suite, and Michael Dutton's transfer achieves even greater
color and clarity than the Biddulph remastering. Unfortunately,
Dutton did not see fit to break the suite down into the seven
tracks Biddulph does, so zeroing in on a favorite theme is
something of a bother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lincoln Portrait'' also appears, though unadvertised on the
outside the package. And once again, Dutton surpasses the efforts
of Obert-Thorn, providing a transfer of uncommon vividness.
</P>
<P>
   But Koussevitzky's 1940 premiere recording of Hanson's sweeping,
moody Symphony No. 3 is the real prize here. Though less familiar,
perhaps, than Hanson's First (``Nordic'') or Second (``Romantic'')
Symphony, the untitled Third, like its predecessors, possesses
gripping immediacy. Its breathless rises and falls are reminiscent
of the symphonies of Carl Nielsen.
</P>
<P>
   First performed by the Boston Symphony under Hanson's direction
in 1938, the work is dedicated to Koussevitzky, who had
commissioned and led the premiere of the composer's Second
Symphony, which Koussevitzky never committed to disk. (So
significant was Hanson's debt to the conductor over time that he
wrote an ``Elegy in Memory of Serge Koussevitzky'' for the Boston
Symphony's 75th anniversary in 1956.)
</P>
<P>
   Hanson found inspiration for the Third Symphony in America's
Scandinavian pioneers, and the piece appropriately melds high drama
with religious intensity. It is, in many ways, a perfect musical
match for the Boston Symphony and Koussevitzky, who zealously
explore its sonorities. Only Hanson's own outstanding recording of
the work on Mercury Living Presence (paired, incidentally, with the
``Koussevitzky Elegy'') can compete with this vividly textured,
colorful interpretation.

   Koussevitzky was not alone in championing new American music
even at the time, but he was in an ideal position to affect its
fortunes. By placing such pieces next to established masterworks in
the concert hall and later recording them, he secured recognition
for many important scores.
</P>
<P>
   That devotion is worth remembering whenever one encounters these
works, and both Biddulph and Dutton have offered the pleasantest of
reminders.

 &UR; CEREAL &LR;  _ Quaker Oats Co., maker of Cap'n Crunch and Life cereals,
says it's raising cereal prices an average of 3 percent, following
last month's 2.5-percent price hike by No. 2 General Mills. The
increases confirm that the beleaguered leaders in the ready-to-eat
cereal industry have abandoned efforts to win back consumers by
slashing prices, a strategy pursued from 1995 to 1997 with mixed
results. By Rebecca Smith

I THANK GOD FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF PRAYER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, I kept an unopened bottle of fertility pills in a
drawer in my guest bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   After three years of my trying to get pregnant, followed by a
series of embarrassing tests, my husband and my obstetrician
decided I needed help to conceive.
</P>
<P>
   I refused to open the bottle. I was convinced that God didn't
need help, that he would answer my prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Even after I miscarried a year later, I stubbornly held on to my
hope. After trying for two more years, I had Jamila. Asha came
along a year later. But I still held on to that bottle of pills.
</P>
<P>
   They were a reminder that I could depend on God alone, and that
he would reward my faith. I know that trusting him is a huge leap
for some people, but I can no more imagine my life without him than
I can fathom life without the privilege of prayer.
</P>
<P>
   That is, after all, how I was born into the family of Jesus
Christ.
</P>
<P>
   One summer night _ afraid of the evil within and the evil
without _ I was moved to pray the sinners' prayer and ask Jesus to
come into my heart. I was no more than 10 or 12, so I did not know
fully what I was reacting to; I did understand that the wages of
sin were death and that Jesus provided the way to eternal life.
</P>
<P>
   I think back now to that night, to Springhill Freewill Baptist
Church, the swirling white ceiling fans circulating in the thick
July heat, the prayers rising and falling from a row of big black
women in white dresses.
</P>
<P>
   At that revival meeting, I knew I wanted to live forever. And
so, when the preacher was done preaching and announced that ``Jesus
stands at the door knocking,'' I wanted to let him into my life, to
be saved from death.
</P>
<P>
   If I ever prayed before then, I don't remember it. I do remember
the church members singing, ``Somebody prayed for me, had me on
their minds, took the time and prayed for me.''
</P>
<P>
   I always believed those lyrics, always believed that was what I
was supposed to do for others. And for me.
</P>
<P>
   The Bible says, ``He that cometh to God must believe that he is
and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.''
</P>
<P>
   Implied in the Scripture is that faith is required for prayer.
It doesn't do me any good to talk to God if I don't believe he
exists and is trustworthy.
</P>
<P>
   When my faith fails, one sure way to regain it is through
prayer. I find that whether I'm on my knees or driving into work,
talking to God causes doubt to dry like dew in the warmth of his
promises.
</P>
<P>
   I don't recall a time when he didn't answer my prayers. There
have been times, though, when I've had to wait for an answer. Other
times he has answered in the midst of my prayers, as if he were a
parent rushing to dry his child's tears.
</P>
<P>
   When my family and I first moved to Fort Worth, we lived in a
hotel while we waited for our house in California to sell. After
two months, I grieved that we had not found a buyer. I was days
away from giving birth to Asha, and the Star-Telegram's obligation
to pay for our hotel stay had long passed. One afternoon, I kneeled
and began praying.
</P>
<P>
   The moment I finished my talk with God and uttered ``Amen,'' the
phone rang. It was my Sacramento real estate agent calling to say
he had an offer, a very good offer, on our home. Thirty days later,
the deal was closed and we moved into our new home.
</P>
<P>
   I realize this may seem coincidental to some, but I count it
among the many prayers God has answered in my life.
</P>
<P>
   Having said that, I admit I sometimes am tempted to try to help
God out, to rush ahead of him to get results. But when I can't do
anything more, when all other sources of help are exhausted, when I
finally move out of the way, that's when God moves.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the circumstances, when I ask God to do something for
me, he usually does something in me. Not only does he change my
circumstances, he changes my character. In prayer, my faith is
increased, and my resolve to live my life in accordance with his
word is strengthened.
</P>
<P>
   So often, instead of asking God for something, I pause to thank
him for all the things he has done and is doing for me and in me.
</P>
<P>
   There have been times in my life when my problems seemed so big,
all I could do was sit still and tell God I was hurting. In those
times, I rely on Christ to intercede for me.
</P>
<P>
   I believe God knows and loves me just that much.
</P>
<P>
   Romans 8:15 says, ``We should not be like cringing, fearful
slaves, but we should behave like God's very own children, adopted
into the bosom of his family.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm an heir and co-heir with Christ. I'm special. More than the
lilies of the fields, more than the birds in the air. Whatever I
need, I can rest assured he will provide it.
</P>
<P>
   All I have to do is ask.  &QL;

VICKERS-EXECUTION (Florence, Ariz.) - Robert Wayne ``Bonzai Bob''
Vickers, Arizona's longest-serving death-row inmate, was executed
by injection Wednesday for killing a fellow prisoner in 1982. He
got his nickname after he killed another prisoner in 1979 and
misspelled the Japanese war cry when he carved ``Bonzai'' in the
corpse's back with a sharpened toothbrush. By MARK SHAFFER. Story
will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
GARFUNKEL-MUSIC (Phoenix) - Speaking with Art Garfunkel, the
unspoken question hangs in the air, creating an odd bit of tension.
It's a bit like having a conversation with O.J. Simpson and dancing
around the subject of Ronald Goldman. Or speaking with Bill Clinton
but politely avoiding any references to a certain beret-wearing
brunette. With Garfunkel, possessor of one of the most virginal
voices in pop music, the million-dollar question has to be, Why the
heck is Paul Simon so amazingly famous and his former singing
partner is . . . well, not? By RANDY CORDOVA. Story moved in the
``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
BOOKS-NEW (Undated) _ Capsule reviews of new and notable books. By
correspondent ANNE STEPHENSON, Special to the Republic. Story moved
in the ``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
NOTARO-COLUMN (Phoenix) - I need my space, and not in a
metaphorical sense. I want, at all times, to be able to thrust my
arms outward, twirl and not touch a single thing, because that's my
space and it belongs to ME. If people insist on breaching that
respect, I can't help it; I'll just want to fight them, most
preferably in a parking lot. One careless step from a stranger into
my twirling circle, and it's all fists and elbows. By LAURI NOTARO.
Story moved in the ``L`` category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
EDIT-JACKSON (Phoenix) - The dilemma that the Rev. Jesse Jackson
now creates for President Clinton and his NATO allies is that his
mission will succeed entirely _ that it will help end the bombing
and bring parties to the negotiating table. If that occurs,
Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic wins, since bombs will have
ceased dropping on Serbia while hundreds of thousands of Kosovars
languish in the muck and mire as refugees. Who will go, then, to
rescue them? Story moved in the ``K'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
TUNDRA-AUTO (Wickenburg, Ariz.) - Leaning on a tailgate, the three
cowboys were talking pickup trucks. Full-size pickup trucks.
Uniquely American. Big as the land.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, they'd be discussing the merits of Chevys and Fords,
maybe a Dodge. But here they were checking out a newcomer,
something they'd never seen before. It was a full-size pickup
truck, all right, but it was built by Japanese automaker Toyota.
The cowboys seemed unsure how to judge the interloper, until one of
them, C.W. Williams, piped up. ``Let's give it the hat test,'' he
said. With PHOTO. By BOB GOLFEN. Story moved in the ``L''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
CD SPINS-MUSIC (Phoenix) - Reviews of the newest music by the
Arizona Republic staff. Story moved in the ``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
STAR WARS-BOOK (Phoenix) - What if someone got lost in space 25
years ago and had never heard of ``Star Wars?'' We asked reporter
Scott Craven to look at the novelized version of ``Episode I _ The
Phantom Menace'' as though he'd never heard of the thing. Does it
hold up as a book? Would it make a decent movie? By SCOTT CRAVEN.
Story moved in the ``E'' category. &QL;

 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    When my father died a few days ago, my mother demonstrated why
so many people admire her and why a day is set aside to honor the
nation's mothers.
 &HT;    My parents separated when I was in elementary school. My father,
a hard-working, hard-drinking, womanizing farm laborer, routinely
beat my mother in front of my siblings and me. Each time, she would
pick herself up, mend her wounds and resume her duties as our
mother _ cooking, cleaning the house, seeing us off to school,
going to the fields where she labored all day in Florida's hot sun.
 &HT;    As far as I know, my father never paid child support. My mother
rarely complained and never went to the authorities. For her part,
in addition to picking vegetables, she worked as a maid in Fort
Lauderdale's hotels and motels. When money was really tight, which
was often the case, she and a group of friends would sell fried
fish and ribs in someone's front yard.
 &HT;    Even when we were young, my siblings and I marveled at how she
could make ends meet _ how she could take $20 and stretch it, feed
six hungry kids _ four of them strapping boys _ with a pound of
neckbones, a bag of rice and a pitcher of Kool Aid, get by without
ever learning to drive, find decent children's clothes in
second-hand stores.
 &HT;    Occasionally, my father would show up and my mother would take
him in. Each time, however, the abuse would start. Many of my
mother's friends urged her to call the police and have him
arrested. She never did.
 &HT;    One time, after my father went to work, my mother packed our
clothes and called a taxi that took us to the bus station. We left
Fort Lauderdale, traveling six hours to Groveland, near Orlando,
where my mother's parents lived.
 &HT;    We stayed there for three months, long enough for my father to
realize that we were not returning as long as he was in the house.
He came to Groveland to talk my mother into coming back to him, but
my grandparents chased him away, threatening to notify the police
if he came near us.
 &HT;    When we returned to Fort Lauderdale, my father did not show up
for about six months. This time, however, he was different somehow.
He did not have his usual anger and swagger. He was ill and my
mother sympathized with him. Again, she took him in and nursed him
back to health.
 &HT;    One morning I overheard them talking. He apologized for his
behavior and promised to be a different person. She kissed him and
told him that she forgave him. She said, though, that she no longer
loved him and did not want to live with him.
 &HT;    ``I have my children to think of,'' she said. ``I've got to take
care of them.''
 &HT;    I will never forget those words. For me, they made my mother
bigger than life, a selfless survivor who assumed her
responsbilities without complaints. Her strength of character
permanently changed my father. She would let him visit us as often
as he wished, and, although he did not pay child support, he began
to bring presents and food. Most important, he never hit my mother
again.
 &HT;    She never spoke negatively of him in our presence, except to say
that he had the world's worst toe jam. On his birthdays, she
encouraged us to send him a card. We never had enough money to buy
anything else.
 &HT;    ``No matter what your father did to me, he is still your
father,'' she would say, if one of us reminded her that he had
yelled at her and beat her.
 &HT;    I would look at her, admiring her clarity of purpose, her
generosity and her capacity to forgive.
 &HT;    When I telephoned and told her that my father had died, she
asked, ``Are you all right, boy? I know you loved him.''
 &HT;    Not surprisingly, she was comforting me.
 &HT;    ``I wish I could have been closer to him,'' I said. ``How do you
feel?''
 &HT;    She paused for a long time. Then, she said, ``He did some bad
things to us, but he asked me to forgive him a long time ago. And I
did. I don't have any hard feelings toward him. I'll see you at the
funeral, son.''
 &HT;    I understood at that moment that, although my mother is a simple
woman on one level, she possesses the inner complexity of one who
has led a moral life, one who has quietly contemplated her place in
the world and has accepted her fate and that of others.
 &HT;    I can think of no better reasons to love her and honor her on
Mother's Day.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    This Mother's Day I will celebrate the same way as I have done
for the last eight years: visiting Mom's grave and remembering her
and yearning for her presence.
 &HT;    After making the 70-minute drive to the south Florida cemetery,
I sit by her graveside and talk to her as if she were right there.
I keep her apprised of what is happening in our world.
 &HT;    I tell her of the latest events concerning our family and
friends. I keep her up to date on international news, and because
she was a Weather Channel junkie I give her the day's weather
forecast and hurricane warnings for Florida where she and my dad
had lived for a dozen years.
 &HT;    I tell her about the mice in my kitchen walls and the garden
snake that occasionally visits my bathroom. I tell her I still
can't cook. I keep her up-to-date on my career _ one that she
encouraged since the day I left her womb.
 &HT;    Now, I will let her know that Dan Quayle from our hometown in
Indiana is back on the campaign trail.
 &HT;    But most important, I remind her that she was the most wonderful
person on earth, and how badly I miss her.
 &HT;    Mother's Day, for the eighth time, will be a sad one for me.
Doubly sad, because my father died last year _ on Mother's Day.
 &HT;    I still choke back tears when I visit her grave. These visits,
though, seem to help with my everlasting grief: feeling cleansed
and close to her, I hope she knows that she is not alone.
 &HT;    There are those who insist that time cures all pain of losing
loved ones. And that holidays like Mother's Day are easier to bear
as years go by. But Mother's Day just heightens my feeling of
emptiness and loss.
 &HT;    Why? Because I can't lionize and applaud my mother. I can't take
her out to dinner. I can't join in friends' conversations about
what to do or where to go on Mother's Day. Even worse, I have to
listen to those who complain that they are too busy to try and
``take mom out for a meal.''
 &HT;    But not everyone could have a mother like mine.
 &HT;    My parents put the wants and needs of their children above their
own in every way imaginable. They lived for each other and for
their children. Everything else was second place. And so, the
memories of my mother continue to be difficult for me on this
holiday.
 &HT;    With both of my parents buried together, the tableau has become
even more troubling. I begin wondering, too, why so many bad people
live long lives and good ones like my mom and dad were taken too
soon.
 &HT;    It's painful to read the advertisements for Mother's Day gifts,
Sunday brunches and loving greeting cards. It depresses me to watch
television commercials promoting everything special about Mom.
 &HT;    To know I can never again feel the excitement and elation over
sharing something good with her hurts as much today as it did when
she died eight years ago. I miss her flashes of wisdom as she
helped me solve life's ``insurmountable'' problems.
 &HT;    My beautiful mother knew many things. She was both an
intellectual and woman of common sense. She loved to read and
learn, sharing tales and quotes and missives with her family and
friends. And she was never too busy to answer our questions or help
us make decisions.
 &HT;    In all of my recollections of Mother, the most endearing quality
was her unselfishness. As an only child who was doted upon by her
parents, she could easily have grown up to be self-absorbed and
self-centered. But she didn't.
 &HT;    Instead, she was the most sensible, caring, funny, warm and
wonderful woman who is missed more than she could ever imagine. I
remember, wryly, how she used to tease us by saying, ``You'll all
forget me when I'm dead and gone.''
 &HT;    How wrong she was, I tell her repeatedly at her graveside.
 &HT;    On this Mother's Day, as every day, Gloria Bookstaff Marx
remains in my heart as the most important person in my life.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    This Mother's Day I will celebrate the same way as I have done
for the last eight years: visiting Mom's grave and remembering her
and yearning for her presence.
 &HT;    After making the 70-minute drive to the south Florida cemetery,
I sit by her graveside and talk to her as if she were right there.
I keep her apprised of what is happening in our world.
 &HT;    I tell her of the latest events concerning our family and
friends. I keep her up to date on international news, and because
she was a Weather Channel junkie I give her the day's weather
forecast and hurricane warnings for Florida where she and my dad
had lived for a dozen years.
 &HT;    I tell her about the mice in my kitchen walls and the garden
snake that occasionally visits my bathroom. I tell her I still
can't cook. I keep her up-to-date on my career _ one that she
encouraged since the day I left her womb.
 &HT;    Now, I will let her know that Dan Quayle from our hometown in
Indiana is back on the campaign trail.
 &HT;    But most important, I remind her that she was the most wonderful
person on earth, and how badly I miss her.
 &HT;    Mother's Day, for the eighth time, will be a sad one for me.
Doubly sad, because my father died last year _ on Mother's Day.
 &HT;    I still choke back tears when I visit her grave. These visits,
though, seem to help with my everlasting grief: feeling cleansed
and close to her, I hope she knows that she is not alone.
 &HT;    There are those who insist that time cures all pain of losing
loved ones. And that holidays like Mother's Day are easier to bear
as years go by. But Mother's Day just heightens my feeling of
emptiness and loss.
 &HT;    Why? Because I can't lionize and applaud my mother. I can't take
her out to dinner. I can't join in friends' conversations about
what to do or where to go on Mother's Day. Even worse, I have to
listen to those who complain that they are too busy to try and
``take mom out for a meal.''
 &HT;    But not everyone could have a mother like mine.
 &HT;    My parents put the wants and needs of their children above their
own in every way imaginable. They lived for each other and for
their children. Everything else was second place. And so, the
memories of my mother continue to be difficult for me on this
holiday.
 &HT;    With both of my parents buried together, the tableau has become
even more troubling. I begin wondering, too, why so many bad people
live long lives and good ones like my mom and dad were taken too
soon.
 &HT;    It's painful to read the advertisements for Mother's Day gifts,
Sunday brunches and loving greeting cards. It depresses me to watch
television commercials promoting everything special about Mom.
 &HT;    To know I can never again feel the excitement and elation over
sharing something good with her hurts as much today as it did when
she died eight years ago. I miss her flashes of wisdom as she
helped me solve life's ``insurmountable'' problems.
 &HT;    My beautiful mother knew many things. She was both an
intellectual and woman of common sense. She loved to read and
learn, sharing tales and quotes and missives with her family and
friends. And she was never too busy to answer our questions or help
us make decisions.
 &HT;    In all of my recollections of Mother, the most endearing quality
was her unselfishness. As an only child who was doted upon by her
parents, she could easily have grown up to be self-absorbed and
self-centered. But she didn't.
 &HT;    Instead, she was the most sensible, caring, funny, warm and
wonderful woman who is missed more than she could ever imagine. I
remember, wryly, how she used to tease us by saying, ``You'll all
forget me when I'm dead and gone.''
 &HT;    How wrong she was, I tell her repeatedly at her graveside.
 &HT;    On this Mother's Day, as every day, Gloria Bookstaff Marx
remains in my heart as the most important person in my life.

 &HT;    SAN DIEGO _ Mother's Day along the U.S.-Mexico border is an
adventure anytime.
 &HT;    For immigration from Mexico has brought us new trends, one of
which is Mexican Mother's Day, celebrated on May 10. As a result,
flower vendors have popped up all over neighborhoods in San Diego
that have large Mexican populations. And the two Mother's Days are
merging more and more.
 &HT;    In Mexico, when Mother's Day falls on a business day, offices
are empty of people spending time with their mothers, usually at
dinners. That doesn't happen here, of course, because it always
falls on a Sunday. So brunch is the order of the day in America.
 &HT;    This year, though, mothers here on the border can have brunch
this Sunday AND dinner on Monday. The flower sellers on the streets
will double their business. We sons and daughters can relieve our
mother-induced guilt trips (as only we Catholics and our Jewish
cousins have) by treating our mothers with love and respect on this
special day, the day to honor all mothers.
 &HT;    One time, years ago _ when I worked at the Tijuana racetrack in
Mexico _ to honor my mother I ordered the track florist to deliver
100-dozen red roses to my younger brother 7:00 a.m. at the border.
There was no duty to be paid as the roses were U.S. produced to
begin with, so Customs simply looked at the papers and wondered who
the lucky mother might be.
 &HT;    At home in San Diego, my other two brothers were busy preparing
for our mother a breakfast fit for a queen _ and making sure she
stayed in bed while the roses were dashing up the freeway.
 &HT;    When the roses arrived, the boys placed them in containers
throughout the house. I might tell you that 1,200 roses are a lot
of roses. Certainly, I heard about how many they were later.
 &HT;    Eventually, Mother arose, wondering why I hadn't called from the
track to wish her a happy Mother's Day. I was wondering why she
hadn't called me, but she hadn't seen the roses yet, for we
deliberately spread them around the living room, the dining room,
and the den and, of all places, the kitchen. The kitchen? Well, the
kitchen is a special place in Mexican homes.
 &HT;    The trans-border call eventually came to my phone at the track,
of course. Mother was happy, my brothers were happy and that all
made me happy. The track florist was pretty happy, too.
 &HT;    Not many honor their mothers with a thousand-plus roses and
breakfast in bed, but they do honor their mothers in many other
ways, in many places. However, no matter how they honor their
mothers, it never seems to be enough.
 &HT;    Surely, every day is Mother's Day. All you have to do is watch
some toddler holding on to its mother's hands in a store, or in the
park. Watch the child look at his mother when he asks her a
question. Watch the mother. I do, all the time, and marvel at the
interaction of mother and child. Did I, I wonder, hang on to my
mother's every word and her hand like I see other children do? Did
I cry for my mother when I was hurt? Of course. Didn't you?
 &HT;    We are lucky here this year to have Mother's Day on Sunday and
Mexican Mother's Day on Monday. But for some of us Mother is
honored every day.
 &HT;    She still deserves more.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    Things happen in threes, they say.
 &HT;    That year was no exception: Dad's stroke, Mother's cancer and,
as if those weren't enough, the fire.
 &HT;    The house remained, but much of the inside was either burned or
ruined by smoke and water damage.
 &HT;    Sifting through debris, I came across Mom's framed diploma,
scorched, from the University of Wisconsin.
 &HT;    ``Get all the education you can,'' Mother, like her father
before her, always said. ``It's the one thing people can't take
away from you. It won't rust or decay or go out of fashion.''
 &HT;    Long before the fields turned fickle and failed, long before the
Great Depression claimed the farm and family pride, she fell in
love with learning and with Miss Learn _ her teacher for all eight
grades in the one-room Carpenter School. It was there she
discovered that an education ``could take you to places you had not
yet dreamed.''
 &HT;    She later attended high school in a nearby town. After her
junior year, her family sold the farm and moved to Madison, Wis.
She tried hard at her new school, earning the highest average in
the senior class.
 &HT;    She wasn't named valedictorian, as she'd been enrolled for only
a year. Still, she was allowed to give the ``senior farewell.''
 &HT;    Living at home during college, she typed graduate theses to pay
for tuition.
 &HT;    The dean of women called her in one day and gave her a knotted
handkerchief containing a mound of coins. A cleaning woman, saving
the money for her daughter's education, had turned it over to the
university after the girl died.
 &HT;    ``Give it to someone who needs it,'' the woman had said.
 &HT;    Nothing deterred Mother from her goal _ not even a proposal from
a doctor, eight years her senior, who wanted to ``take her away
from all this.''
 &HT;    ``I will marry you,'' she told him that September, ``but only
after I graduate in June.''
 &HT;    The day after she received her degree, the ``simple ceremony''
took place.
 &HT;    ``While in school,'' the newspaper said, ``the bride was a
member of the Wisconsin Players and took important roles in
university dramatic productions. She also is a member of National
Collegiate Players.''
 &HT;    After rearing four children and serving her community, Mom
taught drama for 15 years.
 &HT;    ``Since 1958,'' a former student, now a college professor,
recently wrote, ``you have guided my theater views from suggesting
plays to read, productions to work on, to the insight that theater
is constantly changing and should never be locked into one
stereotype. My (higher) education you gave me _ for so many other
students were less prepared and certainly less read than I _ was
all because of you.''
 &HT;    These days, at times, Mother cannot recall the beloved student's
name _ or even who I am.
 &HT;    Back home for her birthday, I took a walk with my brother and
sister.
 &HT;    ``There's Chris with two women,'' she told my husband, watching
out the window. ``I don't know who they are. And I don't ask.''
 &HT;    Alzheimer's disease takes her to places she never dreamed,
locking her into a new role. Each day resembles a ``farewell
speech'' as parts of her memory, parts of her life, fade forever.
 &HT;    Even we, her family, cannot say when or how the illness started.
 &HT;    We had signs, to be sure: her increasingly repeating ``I don't
know; I can't remember; I forget'' said as one sentence _ or her
driving a well-known route and suddenly becoming disoriented and
lost.
 &HT;    Did six years spent caring for a stroke victim defeat her? Or
the stress of her cancer? Or the fire that swept through the house?
What sweeps through Mom destroys her connections. Her diploma can
be reordered, but not her mind.
 &HT;    When memory goes, do we become a stranger not only to other
people but also to ourselves?
 &HT;    ``Get all the education you can,'' Mother (like her father
before her) always said. ``It's the one thing people can't take
away from you.''
 &HT;    Yet Alzheimer's can.

 &HT;    Mother. What is she? Who is she?
 &HT;    The flower industry sells more flowers on Mother's Day than on
any other single day or holiday. And an estimated 65 percent of
Americans will purchase a present for their mothers to celebrate
the occasion.
 &HT;    The card and flower industries have helped us see that mothers
are also grandmothers, mothers-in-law, mother figures, play
mothers, adoptive mothers, and may not even be limited to the
female gender.
 &HT;    Sports figures and anyone else who find themselves on television
invariably utter a ``Hi, Mom.'' People thank their mothers
publically more frequently than their fathers when receiving
awards. Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers talks to his mother
on the telephone prior to every game. It's definitely a
superstition with him.
 &HT;    Mother's Day became an official celebration in the United States
in 1914 while Father's Day wasn't recognized as a national holiday
until 1972. Then there is Mother Earth, Mother Nature, lots of
mothers.
 &HT;    Of course there are mother issues in general and there is still
controversy about who is a mother. Like, is the adoptive mother
your mother or is that reserved for your birth mother? What about
mother figures or ``play mothers.'' Surrogate mothers? What of
women who donate their eggs to other women who have fertility
problems? And what of the women who give birth using donor eggs not
their own?
 &HT;    Do you assume that a single woman with a child is the child's
mother? And what do you think when there are two women with a
child? Is it obvious that they are a couple, co-parents,
co-mothers? A stranger stops the couple and comments on how cute
the child is and inquires who the mother is. ``We both are'' is the
reply. ``No, who is the real mother?'' comes the next question.
 &HT;    Is motherhood really only linked to DNA, genes, conception,
fertility and birth? Or is it nurturing, parenting, caring, and
rearing a child?
 &HT;    I have not spoken with my biological mother in nearly a decade.
But there is a woman with whom I am not biologically linked who I
have known for 13 years. I call her Mom, and she refers to me
either as ``luvey'' or ``my darling daughter.'' At a time when I
was searching for a mother to fill an emotional need, this woman
was real, and we developed a healthy mother-daughter relationship.
I feel love and connection to her and believe she possesses more
maternal instincts than any woman I have encountered.
 &HT;    So on this Mother's Day maybe we can all reflect on what it is
to be a mother, who owns that label in your life and what that
person means to you on the other 364 days of the year beyond
Mother's Day.
 &HT;    The times they are a-changing and mothering and being a mother
ain't what it used to be.

 &HT;    Mother. What is she? Who is she?
 &HT;    The flower industry sells more flowers on Mother's Day than on
any other single day or holiday. And an estimated 65 percent of
Americans will purchase a present for their mothers to celebrate
the occasion.
 &HT;    The card and flower industries have helped us see that mothers
are also grandmothers, mothers-in-law, mother figures, play
mothers, adoptive mothers, and may not even be limited to the
female gender.
 &HT;    Sports figures and anyone else who find themselves on television
invariably utter a ``Hi, Mom.'' People thank their mothers
publically more frequently than their fathers when receiving
awards. Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers talks to his mother
on the telephone prior to every game. It's definitely a
superstition with him.
 &HT;    Mother's Day became an official celebration in the United States
in 1914 while Father's Day wasn't recognized as a national holiday
until 1972. Then there is Mother Earth, Mother Nature, lots of
mothers.
 &HT;    Of course there are mother issues in general and there is still
controversy about who is a mother. Like, is the adoptive mother
your mother or is that reserved for your birth mother? What about
mother figures or ``play mothers.'' Surrogate mothers? What of
women who donate their eggs to other women who have fertility
problems? And what of the women who give birth using donor eggs not
their own?
 &HT;    Do you assume that a single woman with a child is the child's
mother? And what do you think when there are two women with a
child? Is it obvious that they are a couple, co-parents,
co-mothers? A stranger stops the couple and comments on how cute
the child is and inquires who the mother is. ``We both are'' is the
reply. ``No, who is the real mother?'' comes the next question.
 &HT;    Is motherhood really only linked to DNA, genes, conception,
fertility and birth? Or is it nurturing, parenting, caring, and
rearing a child?
 &HT;    I have not spoken with my biological mother in nearly a decade.
But there is a woman with whom I am not biologically linked who I
have known for 13 years. I call her Mom, and she refers to me
either as ``luvey'' or ``my darling daughter.'' At a time when I
was searching for a mother to fill an emotional need, this woman
was real, and we developed a healthy mother-daughter relationship.
I feel love and connection to her and believe she possesses more
maternal instincts than any woman I have encountered.
 &HT;    So on this Mother's Day maybe we can all reflect on what it is
to be a mother, who owns that label in your life and what that
person means to you on the other 364 days of the year beyond
Mother's Day.
 &HT;    The times they are a-changing and mothering and being a mother
ain't what it used to be.

   EVEN IN TERRIBLE ADVERSITY, MOTHER'S DEVOTION WAS CONSTANT. One
morning, columnist Bill Maxwell overheard his parents talking. His
father, a violent and abusive man, was apologizing for his behavior
and promising to be a different person. His mother said that she
forgave him but that she could no longer live with him, adding: ``I
have my children to think of. I've got to take care of them,''
recalls Maxwell. ``I will never forget those words,'' he writes.
``For me, they made my mother bigger than life, a selfless survivor
who assumed her responsbilities without complaints. I can think of
no better reasons to love her and honor her on Mother's Day.''

   ALZHEIMER'S: THE THIEF OF LOVE. Columnist Kirsten Chapman's
mother battles Alzheimer's disease, and now, at times, does not

Chapman writes. Her mother used to tell her: ``Get all the
education you can. It's the one thing people can't take away from
you.'' But sadly, for her mother, Alzheimer's is doing just that.

   SAN DIEGO MOTHERS GET TWO MOTHER'S DAYS! Immigration from Mexico
has brought new trends, such as Mexican Mother's Day on May 10. So,
flower vendors now have popped up all over Mexican neighborhoods in
San Diego. And the two Mother's Days are merging more and more,
observes columnist Raoul Lowery Contreras. In Mexico, when Mother's
Day falls on a business day, offices are empty of people spending
time with their mothers over lunch or dinner, he notes. ``That
doesn't happen here, of course, because it always falls on a
Sunday. So brunch is the order of the day in America,'' he writes.
But this year, mothers on the the border can have brunch this
Sunday AND dinner on Monday, he reports happily.

visiting her mother's grave. ``I sit by her graveside and talk to
her as if she were right there,'' she confesses. She keeps her mom
apprised of what is happening in the world and of the latest events
concerning family and friends. She keeps her up to date on
international news, and because she was a Weather Channel junkie
she gives her the day's weather forecast and hurricane warnings for
Florida where she and her father had lived for a dozen years. ``But
most important,'' Marx writes, ``I remind her that she was the most
wonderful person on earth, and how badly I miss her.''

COMMENTARY: NUDITY AND ENERGY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One hundred fifty peaceful exhibitionists assembled
at 6 a.m. in Manhattan's Times Square recently, stripped off all
their clothes and together posed in the altogether for the
photographer Spencer Tunick.
</P>
<P>
   Before he could get the shot of massed nudes, the lubricious
lensman was arrested for ``tumultuous and violent conduct.'' The
D.A. has charged Tunick with ``promoting the exposure of a
person.'' (What kind of crime is that? I try to do that in this
space twice a week.) We libertarians view this bluenosed
 &QC; suppression of artistic expression as a foolish waste of the
police's time.
</P>
<P>
   Half a world away, at almost the same moment, a crowd of more
than 15,000 middle-aged Chinese of the Fulan Gong sect assembled in
front of the compound housing China's leadership. Fully clothed,
they sat silently on the sidewalk in yoga's lotus position for 13
hours, in deep concentration.
</P>
<P>
   They thereby threw a scare into the Chinese Communist government
the likes of which has not been felt since the demonstration at
Tiananmen Square 10 years ago on June 4.
</P>
<P>
   But this year's demonstration was not political. No signs were
raised, no slogans shouted, no replicas of the Statue of Liberty
held aloft that triggered a massacre. These are practitioners of
qigong (pronounced chee-goong), both a martial art and a method of
breathing and meditation that directs energy to improve health and
spiritual awareness. Though an offshoot of Buddhism and denounced
by the government-run qi establishment, it avoids condemnation as a
cult by claiming not to be a religion.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, Prime Minister Zhu Rongji rolled out no tanks. He
listened to a delegation's complaint about harassment by
officialdom, and offered them bus rides home. The crowd dispersed,
having made its point. The official newspapers are now warning the
Fulan Gong not to try that surprising stunt again.
</P>
<P>
   This can be dismissed as a cult promoted by Li Hongzhi, a
Chinese forced out of China and now in New York. Reported to
believe in alien beings and levitation _ and selling TV cassettes
of his outlook on his Web site _ Li's 5,000-year-old symbol of
yin-yang means ``all is well'' but looks a lot like a swastika.
Tibetan and Chinese friends tell me that by a Buddhist, he's no
Buddhist.
</P>
<P>
   But whether he's selling scary superstition or uplifting
spirituality _ or the brain-body interaction that Western
scientists no longer pooh-pooh _ between 40 and 70 million people
are buying. The movement has about as many members in China as the
Communist Party and is growing much faster. Beijing has not cracked
down because it fears turning the energy of qi on itself by making
martyrs.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu has reason to worry. Communism is producing political
suppression while its capitalist road requires economic
belt-tightening and its social policy limits families to one child.
With 200 million unemployed or underemployed making up 25 percent
of the work force, China may be yearning for a movement offering a
happier, healthier, freer life.
</P>
<P>
   That's what troubles the Forbidden City. ``They remember the
Boxer Rebellion,'' says Columbia University Prof. Robert Thurman,
``a popular movement to purify the corruption of the Manchus. Any
nationwide reawakening of spirituality is seen as a threat to
central control. They feel threatened by any organized movement,
but how do you handle a nonviolent, transcendental ideology that
seems so innocuous?''
</P>
<P>
   In good times, Communism and Confucianism, with their common
respect for authority, can easily co-exist. But when a sense of
impermanence takes hold, and the mandate of Heaven comes into
doubt, all in authority sense the danger of spiritual revival. Most
sects die aborning, but a few, strengthened by repression, mushroom
into a major challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Advice to Zhu: Ease up. Don't turn a shrewd salesman into a
mythic hero. Neither your stolen nuclear secrets nor your boughten
supercomputers can smother an internal brush fire begun in
spirituality and selflessness and ignited by outrage.
</P>
<P>
   On a different order of magnitude, advice to the NYPD and the
Manhattan DA: Lighten up. If they're not blocking traffic and do
nothing more violent than smiling at a camera, let the nudies shape
themselves into a message and pose. Good for tourism, better for
art, best for liberty.

PLANNERS FOR THE APACHE HELICOPTERS SAYS KOSOVO ISN'T IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ During the 1991 Persian Gulf War, the Army's Apache
helicopters were technological stars that used a potent arsenal of
missiles, rockets and cannons to destroy hundreds of Iraqi tanks
with speed and precision.
</P>
<P>
   But the gunships have gotten off to an inauspicious start in the
Kosovo conflict. Two of the attack helicopters have crashed and two
crew members have been killed since 24 of the choppers arrived at a
base in Albania near the Kosovo border. None of the sleek craft has
been sent into action and both crashes involved training missions.
</P>
<P>
   NATO commanders had to wait more than three weeks for the
Apaches _ designed to fight in bad weather and at night _ to arrive
from bases in Germany. The delay was partially attributed to the
Army's insistence that it have a force of 5,000 support troops to
protect and maintain the helicopters at the base.
</P>
<P>
   Though the war against Yugoslavia is well into its second month
and the ethnic cleansing of Kosovar Albanians continues apace, the
Apache gunships haven't been sent into action yet.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the high-tech helicopters were used in the Gulf War
on the first night of Operation Desert Storm to destroy Iraqi air
defenses. The Pentagon credited the Apaches ``with destroying
numerous tanks, trucks and armored vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   But NATO officials and military experts say there are several
reasons why the aircraft have been on the sidelines thus far in the
Balkan conflict.
</P>
<P>
   First, the mountainous Balkan terrain is far more dangerous for
Apache pilots than the deserts of Iraq, a fact brought home by the
first of the training accidents in which the low-flying aircraft
may have crashed after hitting a tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not Desert Storm. We are talking a different terrain.
We are talking a different situation,'' German Maj. Gen. Walter
Jertz, a senior NATO official, said Wednesday. Jertz added that the
Apache crews needed to become more familiar with the region's
topography before going on combat missions.
</P>
<P>
   Jertz said NATO's maps for the area were poor, a potential
danger for Apaches that can fly just a few feet off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Army Maj. Gen. Edward Atkeson, a senior fellow at the
Institute of Land Warfare in Arlington, Va., a think-tank
specializing in Army issues, said Iraq ``is flat like a billiard
table. It's the simplest flying you could have.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosovo is one of the most difficult terrains you could fly
over. It has woods. It has mountains jutting up. It's dangerous,''
Atkeson said.
</P>
<P>
   The dangers of the terrain are prompting the Army to rigorously
train the Apache crews sent to Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's crash came during night training in rugged
northeastern Albania. Initial reports indicated that the aircraft
may have struck power lines.
</P>
<P>
   Another danger much greater in the skies over Kosovo than over
Iraq is the threat from shoulder-fired missiles. The Pentagon
estimated that Yugoslav forces have hundreds of these hard-to-find
weapons, while Iraq had few.
</P>
<P>
   Because they fly low to the ground, the Apaches are more
vulnerable to these weapons than are high-flying jets.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Armitage, a former assistant secretary of defense, said
the shoulder missiles are giving NATO commanders considerable
pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the Apaches increase the probability of killing enemy
tanks and troops, they also increase the likelihood that we will
sustain combat casualties because they fly low and slow,'' Armitage
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another major difference is that U.S. combat troops were never
far away in the Gulf War from an Apache and could be called on to
track down or suppress enemy forces. Over Kosovo, the Apaches would
be on their own, with some help from NATO artillery.
</P>
<P>
   That worries Army planners, according to a military aviation
expert who asked not to be named.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't take attack helicopters into a place where you don't
have some control of the ground,'' the officer said. ``When you
don't have control, you invite the kind of failure that the Soviets
had in Afghanistan with massive losses.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael O'Hanlon, a defense analyst at the Brookings
Institution, a non-partisan think tank, echoed those concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we did in Iraq was use the Apaches in many instances to
attack targets whose locations we knew in advance. In Kosovo, we
are asking the Apaches to go out and find a lot of the targets.
That's a lot more dangerous where there's little or no ground
support providing protection,'' O'Hanlon said.

UGLY WINS FOR BRUINS AGAINST SABRES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The Bruins are out to prove that very ugly really is
beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   For example, back on Feb. 4, 1998, at Marine Midland Arena in
Buffalo, N.Y., it was 15 minutes 51 seconds into the third period
when Dmitri Khristich blasted a shot from the left circle that
deflected into the air, caromed off the head of goalie Dominik
Hasek, and went into the net.
</P>
<P>
   It was strange and it was certainly ugly. But most important, it
counted. That goal, which gave the Bruins a 2-1 lead in a game that
ended in a 2-2 tie, is exactly the type of unorthodox offense the
team is going to have to generate if it is going to beat the
Buffalo Sabres and Hasek when the Eastern Conference semifinal
series opens Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Steve Heinze led the Bruins in scoring against the
Sabres this season with three points (two goals) in five games.
Only one goal came against Hasek. He said the key to beating Hasek
sounds simple enough. It's just not that easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoot, shoot, and shoot again,'' said Heinze. ``You have to
crash the net. You know he's going to save most first shots. If he
sees it, he's going to save it.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no textbook way to beat Hasek. He's not a standup
goalie, a butterfly goalie, or any other version of a style that's
remotely describable. If you ask players how to beat him, the
question is met with shrugs, puzzled looks, and furrowed brows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I knew,'' said Heinze. ``I don't think anybody really
knows. He is unconventional. You can't really figure him. He just
gets the job done and that's why it's so hard to beat him because
he's doing different things. He's saving it with all different
parts of his body. Sometimes he leaves his stick behind and he's
diving at things. But he saves them and that's why it's so tough to
figure him.''
</P>
<P>
   The only other Bruin with two goals against the Sabres this
season, both against Hasek, is defenseman Hal Gill. Gill, who had
three goals all year, laughed at the notion that he might have the
secret as to how Hasek can be solved.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goals are just proof that fluke goals go in on him,'' said
Gill. ``One goal I had came when I turned in and took a quick shot.
It kind of squeaked through his legs. That overtime goal (April 17
in a 2-1 victory) was a shot that knuckled and went through a crowd
and went in. I don't think you're going to get good goals on him. I
remember Dmitri's goal last year, the one that went off the back of
Hasek's head. That's the way you have to score.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Hasek's key assets is his ability to psych out his
opponents, to make shooters so nervous about his impenetrability
that they fire the puck over the net, wide of the net, or worse,
pass up the shot altogether in search of a better play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys and teams get so uptight and worried about how they have
to beat him that they think too much,'' said defenseman Dave
Ellett. ``When we get good shots, we've got to take them. He has a
little bit of an edge because he's played so good. Guys, when they
get good chances, instead of maybe doing what they would do
naturally right away, they outthink themselves and change their
minds and that gives the goaltender an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to make a move, make a move. Don't change your
mind three different ways. He's got no rhyme or reason to his
style, it's so unique. A lot of times, that's in the back of guys'
heads. They think they have to make a perfect shot or a perfect
play to beat him. It's tough to be perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   That is true. Perfectly ugly is just as acceptable and possibly
even preferable in a series like this. It's also important to not
be insecure.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be confident that you can score goals,'' said
Heinze. ``The equation here has always been to get the puck to the
net and crash the net. That's what we're going to have to do with
him or any goalie in the playoffs. If you look around the league at
the goals that are being scored, there are a few tic-tac-toe goals
like with Pittsburgh but the rest of them are throw them at the
net, get guys there, get guys crashing and in the crease, all that
stuff. That's how you're going to beat anybody, especially Dominik
Hasek.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins were 1-4-0 against the Sabres this season but coach
Pat Burns said, in essence, ``So what?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't look at that now,'' said Burns. ``That has no
bearing on it right now.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Bruins go into the game with respect for the Sabres and
respect for Hasek. But they also enter the series with a lot of
self-respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hasek's a good goalie but people have scored on him,'' said
Gill. ``I've scored on him. That pretty much says it. He's a clutch
goalie but we've got Byron Dafoe in net and he can come up just as
big. So we're even.''

BRUINS DRAW A LINE ON THE ICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Let's see, we've got the battle of the goalies, the
pox that is Michael Peca (all scourges should be so productive),
and, sure, the eternal postseason question: who will win the battle
of the special teams?
</P>
<P>
   All that aside, let's get to the true crux of it: the
Bruins-Sabres Eastern Conference semifinal series, to open
Thursday, will turn on what kind of performance the Bruins get out
of their No. 1 trio of Jason Allison, Sergei Samsonov, and Dmitri
Khristich.
</P>
<P>
   As great as Dominik Hasek is, Byron Dafoe can match him nearly
save for save. Peca can't check two lines at the same time (keep
repeating that until you believe it). And don't expect either squad
to make much of a statement with the power play, which will have a
lot to do with Hasek and Dafoe and the general defensive makeup of
both sides. Both sides will grind this series into grist with the
penalty killing.
</P>
<P>
   So, are the Bruins about to advance to the Stanley Cup
semifinals for the first time since 1992? To do so, they'll need
far more out of the Allison-Samsonov-Khristich line than they got
in their first-round triumph over the Hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   Most critical of all, Khristich has to show up with jump in his
legs and muscle in his shot. He totaled only one shot in the first
three games against Carolina, his game completely out of synch,
especially in Game 1 when he had fill-in Randy Robitaille as his
center. Rather than bench him after three games, coach Pat Burns
kept Khristich in the game, reuniting him with Allison and
Samsonov. Khristich improved, which is to say he wasn't invisible.
He was better, but he wasn't close to being an impact player.
Khristich and Cameron Mann were the last to leave the ice here
Wednesday, both taking extra time to tune up their shots.
</P>
<P>
   Against Carolina, Samsonov scored a pair of goals, and one of
those came off an easy pot at the end of a dazzling rush by Landon
Wilson in Game 2. The second-year Russian winger is an electrifying
skater and stickhandler, but he still has a lot to learn when it
comes to using his linemates. A little more give-and-go in his game
would confuse defenses and open up some room for his one-on-one
dances. Right now he is flashy, but predictable, and predictable
leads to some maddening turnovers and not much else. No one wants
him to be a north-south winger, but he must find more options when
he has the puck.
</P>
<P>
   Allison, hurting with a sore wrist, might have potted a handful
of goals with a little more touch around the net. He finished with
none. He did, however, total six assists and tied Ray Bourque
(1-5_6) for most points in the series. He remains a force when he
isn't putting the puck in the net, and his reward for that,
undoubtedly, will be a constant barrage of Peca's stinging hits.
The Bruins can't afford to see Allison shut out again in this
series.
</P>
<P>
   When the three are at their most effective, they force the puck
deep in the offensive end and keep possession. Either Allison or
Khristich can use their size and strength in the corners. Samsonov,
though lacking in size, is strong enough to work the puck deep,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all three of us, wanting to do it,'' said Allison. ``It's
the three of us having the will to do it. That can break down,
though, if, say, I stay out too long, or Deemer (Khristich) tries
to make a pass that isn't there, or if Sammy loses control of the
puck. But I think all three of us can do a good job in there. I
mean, you give Sammy time and he's tough to check _ he's strong and
he's moving in five different directions at 100 miles an hour. He's
stronger than you think down there.''
</P>
<P>
   Without that kind of containment, without that determination to
keep cycling the puck, the No. 1 Boston line essentially rubs
itself off the scoresheet. In fact, the scoring then is left to the
1A line of Joe Thornton between Steve Heinze and Anson Carter. If
Thornton's line can maintain its momentum out of the Carolina
series, then Peca might be switched away from the Allison trio,
opening up more room.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be a good dilemma for us,'' said Heinze. ``Usually
you see the checking line up against your finesse line, facing the
great one-on-one players like (Wayne) Gretzky and (Mario) Lemieux.
Peca can get under your skin a bit, and the history between these
two clubs has been that he's usually on our finesse guys _ Ally,
Deemer, and Sammy.
</P>
<P>
   Home ice will help, or should help. Burns has the home-ice edge
in Games 1 and 2 to buy the Allison line some room. He gets the
last match. Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff undoubtedly will counter with
some quick line changes, forcing Peca onto Allison. The two benches
could look like stretch jack-in-the-boxes for the first couple of
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not discouraged, by any means,'' said Allison, reflecting
on the fact that he didn't score in the opening series. ``If you
aren't getting any chances, then you worry. But, I hit a post . . .
a couple of others, the puck wouldn't get down for me. I was making
the right decisions. I was placing the puck, or trying to put it
where I thought was a good spot, it just wasn't going there. Sure,
it would have been nice to score a goal, but I got an assist per
game. I'd call that a good slump, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   The days ahead are sure to bring a lot more talk, from both
sides, about oportunities lost and shots to open holes that were
quickly closed. When Hasek and Dafoe are at their best, we may need
a U.N. interpreter to translate the one-way mutterings among the
forwards.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins showed in Round 1 that they can win with something
less than their best. This time around, they won't have that
opportunity.

RELUCTANTLY, A HOSPITAL SPECIALIZES IN TREATING THE WOUNDS OF WAR 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Dr. Rade Grbic, an orthopedic surgeon who
directs Kosovo's largest hospital, has become a reluctant expert in
bomb blasts.
</P>
<P>
   He admits with some mordancy that it's a rather specialized
field. But after Kosovo's low-intensity warfare between the
Yugoslav authorities and the Kosovo Liberation Army, which
generally involved the more mundane intricacies of gunshot wounds,
NATO's air war has provided new opportunities for study.
</P>
<P>
   Bomb and missile blasts of the ordinary kind, like the one that
split a passenger bus in two just north of Pristina, over a bridge
at Luzane, are bad enough. ``There are a lot of burns and the
effect of the blast, which produces a lot of open fractures,
perforated eardrums and blood clotting from internal injuries,''
Grbic said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's the cluster bombs that are the worst problem,'' he
said, describing the effects of anti-personnel weapons that spread
shrapnel over a wide area. ``They cause extreme trauma in the
survivors, many with severe wounds in the arms and legs, and in
some cases, amputations.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the bomblets don't explode, ``leaving a problem for
the future,'' Grbic said. He described a group of kids tending
cattle in the village of Doganovic, near Brezovica, who tried to
open a bomblet with a knife. The explosion killed five of them and
wounded seven others.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike its pre-war days, when its 2,400 beds were 90 percent
full, the hospital, The Clinical Center at Pristina, is only 60
percent full now. One reason, Grbic said, is the enormous exodus of
refugees who have fled or been pushed from Kosovo, which has
reduced the patient pool.
</P>
<P>
   But with little gasoline available and the fact of daytime
bombing, the number of chronic patients coming to the hospital for
treatment is also much reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Before the war, there were 3,700 employees, roughly half Serbian
and half Albanian, with some 700 medical experts, 70 of them MDs.
But despite Kosovo's horrors and the exodus of hundreds of
thousands of ethnic Albanians, about 80 percent of the staff
members have remained, and nearly all of the doctors. But some
nurses with children have left, and most of the male Serb staff
have sent their own families out of Kosovo _ including Grbic, who
is a Serb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hospital workers are different, and feel a special moral and
ethnic responsibility,'' he said. Some Albanian workers have left,
while others came with their families to the hospital for refuge.
Some Serb families came, too, he said, ``under the reasonable
theory that the hospital will be the last place to be bombed.''
</P>
<P>
   At 39, Grbic said proudly, he is the youngest hospital director
in Yugoslavia. In general, this hospital, Yugoslavia's second
largest, is doing well, having prepared for war. Stocks of
medicines and sanitary bandages have been supplemented by Greek aid
through Doctors of the World, and there are four generators and
stocks of diesel in case NATO cuts off electricity again in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A three-truck convoy with more Greek aid from Doctors of the
World was nearly attacked Wednesday afternoon coming to Pristina
from Skopje, the Macedonian capital, when NATO planes swooped low,
said Dr. Lakis Nikolaou, a Greek neurosurgeon who brought the
convoy to the hospital. A bomb or missile landed about 150 yards
away and the convoy nearly went off the road, he said, shaken. He
conceded that the pilot may have seen the red crosses on the trucks
at the last minute and diverted his munitions.
</P>
<P>
   Since the air campaign began on March 24, this hospital has
treated 420 civilians wounded in NATO bombings, 300 of whom have
required surgery. Between 15 percent and 20 percent are children,
and about 60 percent are Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital also treats wounded soldiers for life-threatening
medical emergencies, Grbic said unprompted, but after treatment
they are transferred as soon as feasible to military hospitals in
Belgrade and Nis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a sensitive area, and we want to have the designation of
a civilian hospital,'' he said. He also volunteered that the army
was not stockpiling any munitions or fuel in the hospital or on its
grounds. Men in uniform were visible in the hospital, but not in
large numbers, especially given the number of uniformed pedestrians
throughout Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   Grbic would not reveal the number of military casualties treated
here, but said they were fewer than the number of civilian
casualties, ``especially in the last three weeks, as NATO has moved
into the phase of bombing moving targets,'' like convoys.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   This hospital gets most of Kosovo's casualties from NATO's
accidents of war. The totals include the 15 survivors of the Luzane
bus bomb (one person in intensive care died on Tuesday, bringing
the death toll to 41) and others, like most of the Vojvode family,
ethnic Albanians from Srbica who were injured when a bomb fell near
their house 20 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Murat Vojvode, 37, died, and five children were injured, all of
whom were admitted here. His wife, Shehrije, was fine, having been
chatting over at a neighbor's. Their son, Shefqet, 10, remains in
intensive care with a perforated colon and a colostomy, and the
other children fill one room at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Mentor, 13, groaned steadily, coming out of anesthesia after
treatment for a deep shrapnel wound in one leg and open fractures
just below both knees. His mother tried to comfort him and hush him
in turns, while trying to describe what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   Bexhet, 5, cried for his mother's attention and a cracker, while
the other children, Albert and 1-year-old Jeridona, lay still or
slept.
</P>
<P>
   ``The planes were very low, and I saw them drop a bomb in the
street,'' Mrs. Vojvode said. ``And then I heard the screaming from
my house.''
</P>
<P>
   After 20 days, the family is much improved, but unclear about
where to go. Mrs. Vojvode, who was wearing a pink sweatshirt marked
``Hugo Boss,'' thinks they will return to Srbica to live in her
sister-in-law's house. ``We don't have any money,'' she said. ``We
have food from the hospital, and we hope there will be some
humanitarian aid.''
</P>
<P>
   Grbic presented the Vojvodes as an example of cluster-bomb
wounds. The Behluli family, some of the luckiest aboard the Luzane
bus because they were traveling at the very back, were recovering
from burns.
</P>
<P>
   Xhevahire Behluli, 30, was badly burned on the face and body and
broke both of his legs. Three children were with him, and only
Albulena, a pixieish 12-year-old in her newly shorn hair, was hurt
very much, with her arm in a sling from hand wounds and bruises.
</P>
<P>
   Another little girl, badly burned on the face and body, her leg
fractured and her hair cropped short, lay moaning softly in her
bed. She knows her name is Majlinda, her mother is Fatima and her
father Ejup; she appears to be 2 years old; she was on the bus with
her mother and brother but has not yet said her brother's name.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors think her mother and brother are dead. ``She'll be
fine, but we don't know anything more about her,'' Grbic said,
upset. ``She's alone and no one has come to find her.''

CLINTON TOURS BASES IN MORALE-BUILDING EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMSTEIN, Germany _ Trying to boost morale in the wake of the
first NATO casualties in its six-week bombing campaign, President
Clinton barnstormed Belgium and Germany Wednesday, urging American
soldiers to stay the course and vowing to intensify the attacks on
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the deaths of two American pilots in the second crash of
a US Army Apache helicopter in as many weeks, Clinton, General
Wesley K. Clark, and Defense Secretary William S. Cohen gave an
upbeat assessment of the air campaign against the forces of
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, the NATO commander, said there were no plans to send in
ground troops, and denied reports that a plan that called for
60,000 such troops had been drawn up.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I sound upbeat, it's because I am upbeat,'' said Clark.
``And the reason I'm upbeat is because we're winning. The air
campaign is working and it is working well.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark made that point to Clinton during the president's first
stop Wednesday, at NATO headquarters in Brussels. He also warned
that NATO casualties like the ones that occurred early Wednesday
were inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   But the second crash of an Apache in nine days, even before the
helicopters have come under hostile fire, underscored the costs of
escalating the war over Kosovo and raised concern among military
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton referred to the crash only briefly, paying tribute to
the dead pilots as ``two brave Americans'' while addressing Air
Force personnel and their families at Spangdahlem Air Base in
Germany. Many of those at the air base learned of the fatal crash
only a few hours before Clinton spoke to them.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spent most of his time praising and meeting soldiers and
their families, and assuring them that the American people support
what they are doing. Clinton told them their mission was noble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mission in Kosovo has nothing to do with trying to acquire
territory or dominate others,'' Clinton said. ``It is about
something far more important _ creating the kind of world where an
innocent people are not singled out for repression, for expulsion,
for destruction just because of their religious and ethnic
heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton contrasted the ``ethnic cleansing'' _ a term coined by
Serbs to refer to the forced removal of a different ethnic group _
with the multiracial, multiethnic group of some 2,000 US military
people who crowded into a hangar to hear him speak. He said the
number of people expelled from Kosovo in the last two months is
equal to the population of Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosovo is an affront to everything we stand for,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, the president met with
the three US servicemen who had been captured by Serb forces and
released by Milosevic to the Rev. Jesse Jackson last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a leather bomber jacket, Clinton stood with the smiling
former prisoners, Staff Sergeants Christopher Stone and Andrew
Ramirez and Specialist Steven Gonzales, who were dressed in their
army fatigues. Clinton praised the soldiers and their families, who
accompanied them, saying he was ``very moved by them.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Cohen said he was likely to recommend the release of
two captured Serb soldiers being held by American forces, but
insisted it was not a reciprocal gesture for Milosevic's releasing
the three US servicemen. Cohen and Clinton both stressed that the
US servicemen were in Macedonia, not Serbia, when they were
captured and should never have been taken in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The crash of the Apache helicopter, occurred while Air Force One
was en route to Brussels, during a nighttime training mission about
45 miles northeast of the military airport at Rinas, Albania.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time that one of the vaunted attack
helicopters crashed while American pilots prepare to deploy them in
Kosovo. The two crew members in the April 26 crash escaped with
only minor injuries, but Wednesday's victims were not as lucky.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said Army investigators were still trying to determine why
the helicopter crashed, but said there was no indication it had
faced hostile fire.
</P>
<P>
   Because they are designed to fly low and attack the tanks and
mobile units that Serb forces have used to destroy villages and
expel ethnic Albanians from Kosovo, the Apaches are an important
military and psychological weapon against the Milosevic regime.
They were expected to be deployed within days, but the two crashes
raise questions about their reliability and what will happen when
they come under hostile fire.
</P>
<P>
   Briefing reporters at Spangdahlem, Clark said the crash was an
inevitable risk of training for combat. Cohen noted that seven
soldiers were killed in a helicopter training accident at Fort
Campbell in Kentucky last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a risk-free campaign,'' said Cohen. ``We are
likely to suffer casualties. Any campaign has inherent dangers
involved to the people who are carrying out and prosecuting it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clark insisted that six weeks of bombing, which has
intensified since skies cleared a week ago, has taken a toll on
Yugoslav forces. He said NATO is beginning to inflict heavy damage
on the tank and mobile artillery units that are destroying villages
in Kosovo and creating the flood of refugees that threatens to
destabilize surrounding countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last 48 hours, we've hit 10 armor concentrations, 11
artillery positions, three command posts, fuel dumps, radio relay
links, ammo dumps, barracks, bridges, railways, border posts,''
said Clark. ``We're hitting them hard, right where it hurts, on the
ground in Kosovo. Thousands of these forces are now in hiding,
which at least stops them from doing what they were doing.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``We're going to go on looking for them. This is a
relatively small area. It's about the size of the state of
Connecticut, and there are not that many places for them to hide.
We're going to pin them down, close them out, and take them out.
And we'll keep on hitting them until Milosevic faces up to the
demands of the international community.''
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that NATO pilots are flying lower to
minimize the risk of mistakenly attacking civilians, and to get a
better look at Serb forces on the ground, Clark said the pilots are
safer now that they had been because the Yugoslav air defense
system has been diminished by bombing. Besides two NATO planes
being shot down, only two others have suffered what he called
battle damage. Both of the pilots in the downed planes were
rescued.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've flown over 15,000 sorties, of which 5,000 have been
strike missions. We now have more than 700 aircraft, over 30 ships,
almost double the forces we had some five weeks ago, with more on
the way,'' said Clark. ``The target sets have been deepened and
broadened, and measures are underway to further tighten the
strategic noose around Serbia.''

A TRUNKLOAD OF TRIVIA IN HONOR OF ELEPHANTS

<P>
   Elephants are big.
</P>
<P>
   Baby Bonnie is the reigning star at the Fort Worth Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   The 700-pound baby, born Dec. 16, is the first elephant born at
the zoo in its 90-year history. Her name, short for Bluebonnet, was
selected from suggestions made by schoolchildren and first
trumpeted in a naming ceremony this month.
</P>
<P>
   At the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History, the Omni
Theater opened its own trunk show this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Africa's Elephant Kingdom'' is the story of an elephant family
that makes a perilous trip across Kenyan plains to escape a
terrible drought. The 40-minute film pairs the massive mammals with
the massive IMAX format for a show that makes a big impression.
</P>
<P>
   But this spotlight on pachyderms is hardly unique. Throughout
history, elephants have had a big impact on popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   Elephants have loomed large in literature: Babar, the King of
the Elephants, is regal but still playful, as well as a natty
dresser, in a book series by Jean De Brunhof.
</P>
<P>
   Elephants have figured in military history: Hannibal crossed the
Alps with elephants on his way to fight the Roman army.
</P>
<P>
   Elephants have been befriended by royalty: Queen Victoria
protested when the London Zoological Gardens decided to sell Jumbo,
an elephant beloved by Londoners, to P.T. Barnum. It didn't help;
Jumbo was sold anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Elephants have found fame and fortune in Hollywood: ``Dumbo,'' a
Disney story about a little elephant with big ears, is a favorite
of moviegoers.
</P>
<P>
   Elephants have secured a place in the annals of comedy: Q:
What's red and white and gray? A: Campbell's cream of elephant
soup.
</P>
<P>
   ELEPHANT FACTOIDS:
</P>
<P>
   Elephants are of two types, African and Asian. African elephants
are larger and have much bigger ears.
</P>
<P>
   The largest elephants grow to be about 12 feet tall and weigh
about 9 tons.
</P>
<P>
   Elephant tusks grow throughout an elephant's life and can weigh
more than 200 pounds. Among Asian elephants, only the males have
tusks. Both sexes of African elephants have tusks.
</P>
<P>
   Elephants have ``fingers'' at the end of their trunks to help
them grab things. Asian elephants have one trunk finger, and
African elephants have two.
</P>
<P>
   Elephants live 50 to 60 years on average.
</P>
<P>
   The gestation period for elephants is 22 months, and newborns
weigh between 250 and 300 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Elephants perform greeting ceremonies a member of the group
returns after a long time away. The welcoming animals spin around,
flap their ears and trumpet.
</P>
<P>
   Elephants eat about 350 pounds of grass, leaves, bark and other
vegetation every day.
</P>
<P>
   Elephants are on the endangered species list. About 600,000
African elephants and 50,000 Asian elephants are left in the world.
About 20 percent are in captivity. Sources: The People's Almanac;

COHEN SAYS TWO   SERB SOLDIERS MAY BE FREED

<TEXT>
<P>
   SPANGDAHLEM, Germany _ Defense Secretary William S. Cohen
Wednesday said he was likely to recommend the release of two Serb
soldiers being held prisoner by the US Army.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said he had asked Cohen and his National
Security Council staff to consider the possible release of the
Yugoslav POWs _ now held in Germany _ and to make a recommendation
to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect to get it in a couple of days,'' said Clinton,
standing for photographers with the three US servicemen turned over
to the Rev. Jesse Jackson by Yugoslav authorities last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would expect within a relatively short period of time that
we could see their release,'' Cohen said of the POWs, adding it
could take place ``within days.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cohen emphasized that releasing the Yugoslavs would not be
the reciprocal good will gesture that Jackson had urged.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a good will overture to Mr. Milosevic,'' said
Cohen. ``I don't believe Mr. Milosevic has made any good will
overture to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen maintains that Serb forces had no right to take the three
Americans prisoner as they patrolled near the Macedonia-Serbia
border March 31.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the release of the Serb prisoners could give new momentum
to the diplomatic efforts being led by Russia to find a negotiated
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, however, Clinton insisted there would be no
negotiation on NATO's five core demands: that the killing end; that
Serb forces withdraw from Kosovo; that refugees be allowed to
return; that an international force ``with NATO at its core'' be
allowed into Kosovo to protect the refugees; and that Kosovo be
given back the autonomy Milosevic stripped it of in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The two Serb soldiers whose release Cohen said was impending
were captured separately last month by rebels from the separatist
Kosovo Liberation Army. The KLA turned them over to Albanian
government officials, who handed them to American forces.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the attention paid to the three captured
Americans, there has been little said about the Serb prisoners.
Pentagon spokesman Kenneth H. Bacon said the administration had
purposely not used them as a bargaining chip or a propaganda tool.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said one of the Serb prisoners was still being examined by
the International Red Cross. Some sources suggested that prisoner
may be reluctant to return to Serbia because his KLA captors had
videotaped him making statements that his comrades in the Yugoslav
armed forces had engaged in summary executions and systematic rape
of ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanying Cohen Wednesday, Bacon said he did not know if the
prisoner being examined by the Red Cross is the one in the
propaganda film.
</P>
<P>
   If released, the Serb prisoners would most likely be turned over
to the Red Cross or to Swedish diplomats, who represent US
interests in Belgrade.

PACT OPENS WAY FOR EAST TIMOR INDEPENDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Indonesia and Portugal Wednesday signed an agreement
paving the way for East Timor's independence, ending nearly 16
years of UN-brokered talks and setting the stage for a potentially
violent Aug. 8 vote on whether the island's 800,000 inhabitants
will chose to break with Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   The accord was hailed by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan as a
major turning point in the former Portuguese colony's troubled
history. But independence advocates warned that a UN observer
mission of several hundred international police envisioned for East
Timor would be insufficient to halt the spiraling violence that has
cost the lives of more than 100 Timorese in the past four months.
</P>
<P>
   Exiled independence advocate Jose Ramos Horta, who shared the
1996 Nobel Peace Prize, warned the UN in a letter Monday that
failure to disarm anti-independence militias and to secure the
withdrawal of most of the 20,000 Indonesian troops stationed in
East Timor before the election would lead to a ``disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Faced with stiff opposition to an armed UN presence in East
Timor, Annan said that he had to be ``realistic'' about the scope
of the UN role. And he conceded that the UN would have no
responsibility for guaranteeing security during the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``The maintenance of law and order is the responsibility of the
Indonesian government,'' he said. ``We are going to press for a
secure environment and the government has assured it will work with
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The pact recognizes the Timorese's right to self determination
and grants them a vote to accept or reject an Indonesian proposal
for wide-ranging autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   If the Timorese vote yes, they would be granted the authority
over a local government, education and cultural affairs, leaving
Indonesia in charge of foreign affairs, national defense, and
monetary policy. If the vote is no, the Timorese will be granted
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said that many details of
the security arrangements need to be worked out before the vote.
</P>
<P>
   But Annan warned Jakarta in a confidential memo, presented
Wednesday to Alatas and Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaimie Gama,
that he would not give his blessing to the vote unless it brings
``armed civilian groups under strict control,'' bans rallies by
armed militias, and begins disarming civilian groups in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   The memo, obtained by Globe, also demands that Indonesia
re-deploy its military forces, grant free access to the media and
arrest and prosecute those who ``incite or threaten to use
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   The accord was a bittersweet victory for Timorese rebels and
pro-independence advocates. While many fear that the Indonesia
military may seek to disrupt the vote, they praised the accord for
providing the first formal recognition by Indonesia of East Timor's
right to self-determination since it annexed the former Portguese
colony in 1976. More importantly, they said it will involve the
first large international presence in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 23 years we have been fighting all alone,'' said Mari
Alkatiri, a representative of the East Timorese resistance front,
FRETILIN. ``This is the first time that some hundreds of UN
observers will be placed in East Timor. Our voice will be heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia was first invaded and occupied by Indonesian troops in
1975, shortly after Portugal withdrew from its former colony. Human
rights advocates estimate that hundreds of thousands of Timorese
have since died at the hands of the Indonesian army.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Indonesia's leader B.J. Haibibie announced that
Jakarta will permit the former Portuguese colony to have
independence. Many believe he made the offer in good faith. But
there is growing fear that elements within the Indonesian military
are seeking to plunge territory into civil war.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, East Timor has been plagued by violence.
Pro-Indonesian militias, armed by the military, have launched a
reign of terror on the islands.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most brutal massacres, Indonesia troops surrounded
the Catholic church in the village of Liquica the early morning on
April 6, opening fire on hundreds of church-goers and refugees
seeking sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco de Jesus da Costa, a Timorese electrician who survived
the machete attack in the church, said that he will not go back
until the UN peacekeeping force controls the security.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I come back, the military and the militias will kill me,''
he said in a telephone interview Wednesday from Washington, where
he was briefing Congress on the violence.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the US Senate and House passed resolutions aimed
at pressuring the Indonesian government to permit a free and fair
election. The Senate Resolution appealed to the Clinton
administration to contribute to an international trust fund for the
UN mission in East Timor, and appealed to the Pentagon and State
Department to step up their pressure on Jakarta to disarm the
militias.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perpetrators of violence want to sabotage the ballot on
East Timor's future,'' said Senator Patrick Leahy, of Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   The House version, sponsored by Rep. Patrick Kennedy, Democrat
of Rhode Island, was stronger, urging the administration to
restrict all military transfers to Indonesia until it ends the
paramilitaries' reign of terror.
</P>
<P>
   ``The threat by the United States to cut off military assistance
and arms transfers should serve to get the attention of the
Indonesian government,'' Kennedy said.

ALBANIAN LEADER FREED FROM HOUSE ARREST 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ After weeks of enforced isolation, a key leader of ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo arrived in Rome on Wednesday from Serbia as a
guest of the Italian government.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim Rugova, 54, a moderate intellectual who had long
embraced a policy of nonviolent resistance to the Serbian
authorities in Kosovo, was until now reported to be under house
arrest, according to NATO and a German journalist who stayed in
Rugova's house for the first weeks of the allied bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He shocked many of his followers when he criticized the NATO
bombing campaign on Serbian television on April 2nd. Western
leaders said that his statements had been doctored and that he was
forced to comply with Serbian authorities. Serbian officials have
denied that, pointing to Rugova's reported meetings with Serbian
leaders and even to an agreement Serbian media said Rugova signed
with Serbian President Milan Milutinovic late last month.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the Kosovo Liberation Army in Tirana have said
that if Rugova's statements were not coerced, then he was a traitor
to the ethnic Albanian cause. Wednesday, they said that while they
welcomed Rugova's release, he was not the legitimate leader of the
ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the exact circumstances of his stay in Serbian
territory, Rugova's sudden arrival in the West suggested that
Belgrade is seeking to gather momentum and public support for a
mediated settlement to the conflict. Previous requests by Western
intermediaries for Rugova's release had been turned down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be eager to have an opportunity to talk to him and
hear his perspective on what's been happening to his people in
Kosovo,'' said James Foley, a State Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Rugova, who stepped off a chartered plane Wednesday with his
wife and children, wearing a smile and a trademark silk scarf
around his neck, did not speak to reporters and gave no public
indication of what his circumstances had been. Instead, he met with
Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema and Foreign Minister
Lamberto Dini. In a statement, the Italian government said they had
``examined the possibility of a political-diplomatic solution to
the conflict, to which Rugova can contribute as a free man.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, a government official who was familiar with the
discussion said that Rugova did not offer a new plan for an end to
the conflict, but reiterated his longstanding views that a
political solution is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``His position, and the moderate orientation he had at
Rambouillet, hasn't changed,'' the official noted. ``The main
difference is that he is now free to say whatever he wants,
wherever he wants.''
</P>
<P>
   While Rugova spoke with Italian officials, his wife and children
were moved to the small town of Artena, outside Rome, where other
Rugova family members have been living for close to a month.
Italian officials said that all of Rugova's relatives were now out
of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, it has not been clear whether Rugova was able to
express himself freely, but it was evident that his freedom of
movement was sharply curtailed. Last month, a reporter for the
German newsmagazine Der Spiegel wrote an account detailing how she
was at Rugova's home in Pristina, when Serbian forces put him under
house arrest and witnessed how he was pressured into signing
statements by Serbian authorities.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On April 28, Serbian television announced an agreement between
Rugova and Milutinovic to work on a political settlement for
Kosovo. In that program, Rugova addressed the camera from Pristina,
the capital of Kosovo, and speaking in Serbian, said, ``the most
important thing is this mutual trust that we have built and that
the world will salute.'' He told the cameras that he had
``successfully cooperated'' with Serbian officials.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement, Rugova and Milutinovic, agreed to form a
new, temporary government for the province, resume negotiations on
a form of self-rule for Kosovo, and invite some foreigners as
``guests'' to attend the talks.
</P>
<P>
   That agreement did not address NATO demands that an
international military force, with NATO at its core, secure the
return of Kosovo refugees. Nor did it meet the expectations of the
Kosovo Liberation Army, which with its militant tactics and
determination to fight for Kosovo's independence, has sought to
supplant Rugova.
</P>
<P>
   On April 6, a delegation from Sant' Egidio, a Catholic religious
organization based in Rome that is active in relief work and
conflict mediation, went to Belgrade to seek a peaceful conclusion
to the war. The group is known to both Serbian officials and Rugova
and earlier this decade helped negotiate an unsuccessful agreement
for Serb and Albanian children to be educated in the same schools
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Marazziti, a spokesman for Sant'Egidio, said that the
delegation which went in April spoke over the telephone with
Rugova, but said members received the call on condition that they
not discuss the logistics of the conversation with Rugova. ``He
gave us the impression that he was free to express his thoughts,''
Marazziti said. ``But that he was not free to move around as he
pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   The delegation pressed Milutinovic and other Serbian officials
to allow Rugova to travel to the West. At the time, Marazziti said,
officials rejected the proposal, saying they were concerned about
protecting Rugova's safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``His arrival here re-establishes his legitimacy as a leader,''
Marazziti said. ``He will be able to express himself without
restrictions, and he is still a significant player in the search
for a peaceful outcome.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NABLUS, West Bank _ From his hillside offices, Munib Masri can
look down on the neighborhood where his grandfather's family
founded the city's first university and survey the old town center
where uncles and cousins served as mayors.
</P>
<P>
   But Masri, a dapper, Texas-educated billionaire, keeps his eye
on new features of the Nablus landscape, all of which he had a hand
in building: a Palestinian stock exchange, a modern television
assembly plant, the headquarters of Paltel, the Mideast's first
privately owned phone company.
</P>
<P>
   These are cornerstones of an emerging Palestinian economy, being
built with offshore Palestinian money in expectation of statehood.
And all are offshoots of the Palestinian Development and Investment
Co., or Padico, a Nablus-based holding company run by the
iron-willed Masri. In five years, Padico has become the biggest and
most influential company in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with
interests ranging from manufacturing and real estate to finance and
power generating.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will do everything we can to put Palestine on the economic
map of the world,'' said Masri, who made his fortune in Europe and
the Persian Gulf during the quarter-century that Nablus was under
Israeli administration.
</P>
<P>
   In government circles, Padico is applauded for bringing urgently
needed Palestinian capital and business skills back home. Local
critics, though, contend that it rests on a foundation of cronyism,
nepotism and protectionism, with troubling implications for a
Palestine of the future. Some see Padico's close ties to Yasser
Arafat's Palestinian Authority as a framework for further
concentration of wealth in a society already riven by deep
inequities.
</P>
<P>
   In project after project, Padico has recruited top Palestinian
managerial and engineering talent, most with advanced degrees from
abroad, and assembled financial backing for critical new
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to promote private investment here, one of the
engines is Padico,'' said Mohsen Khalil, Middle East director for
the International Finance Corp., the World Bank's private
investment arm. ``They bring in a lot of competence, a lot of
expertise and a lot of resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Local business rivals, however, portray Padico as an enemy of
the free market and a beneficiary of political concessions. And
Padico's founding investors are resented by others here for their
affluence, their long absence and their Westernized ways. (Masri's
wife and six adult children are U.S. citizens, and most senior
Padico employees speak fluent English.)
</P>
<P>
   ``During all our struggles here, during the intifada, all these
millionaires were living abroad,'' said Hatem Abdul-Qader, a member
of the Palestinian legislative council, referring to the uprising
against Israeli military administration that erupted in 1987.
``Then these people came to harvest the fruits of our struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition legislators hint darkly that they have proof of
payoff schemes and secret deals to restrict competition. But they
have yet to produce any evidence of corruption involving Padico.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed Nashabishi, the Palestinian Authority's finance chief,
dismisses the attacks. ``They are pioneers,'' he said. ``Let those
who criticize them come and compete with them.''
</P>
<P>
   But the authority gave Padico a head start. Its subsidiaries are
already busy crisscrossing Palestinian territory with fiber-optic
cables, erecting beachfront condominiums beside Gaza refugee camps,
and spawning an array of start-up companies from plastics makers to
poultry farms.
</P>
<P>
   Among Padico's most prominent projects is the Palestinian
Authority's showcase tourism enterprise, a $48 million Bethlehem
luxury hotel being rushed through construction in hopes of
receiving Pope John Paul II and others for millennial celebrations.
The authority's biggest manufacturing venture, a Gaza industrial
park with its own Israeli customs post, is another subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   And Padico is the only private local shareholder in a new
Palestinian home mortgage corporation, a $22 million partnership
including the authority and a German development bank. All three
projects are being developed with loans and equity from the
International Finance Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how they first received these contracts,'' said
Husan Khader, a Nablus legislator. ``But once they have the job,
they do it professionally,'' adding that if they were responsible
for all the Palestinians' economic affairs, ``they would be a
civilizing influence.''
</P>
<P>
   Masri is happy to acknowledge that he is an Arafat confidante.
Now a member of the Palestinian central council, he was a Jordanian
Cabinet minister when the Palestine Liberation Organization rose
against King Hussein in 1970. Dispatched to the PLO leader's desert
hideout by Hussein, Masri forged an enduring bond with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I am so close to Arafat, some people think that Padico
is part of the government,'' Masri said. ``But it is not. It is
completely private and independent.''
</P>
<P>
   Above all, Padico is seen here as an extension of the Masri
clan, West Bank patricians who made fortunes abroad but always
considered Nablus their home. The family traces its lineage back
more than three centuries in this old Jordan Valley city _ which,
with Padico's help, aspires to become the business capital of a
future Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Munib Masri's second cousin, Sabih Nasri, another recently
returned billionaire, runs Paltel. Almost every other Padico
subsidiary has a Masri or two on its board. The Palestinian
Authority's trade and industry chief is another Nablus cousin,
Maher Masri.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even in the family, there is dissent. ``What they are really
doing,'' said Muawia al-Masri, a distant relative who represents
Nablus on the legislative council, ``is imposing monopolies on
services, which is hurting the Palestinian people.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Masri bridles at such comments. ``We don't want to monopolize
anything,'' he said. ``There is plenty of work to do here. We need
10 Padicos to repair the damage that the Israelis have done to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no better indicator of Padico's influence, and the
ingrown nature of its business ties, than its role in the nascent
stock market. Started by Padico in 1997 with a charter from Arafat,
the Nablus exchange is managed by a small Padico subsidiary.
Suleiman Abbadi, the recently hired director, reports to the
exchange chairman, Sabih Masri, who is also chairman of Paltel, the
largest company traded on the exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Paltel, Padico and a Padico real estate subsidiary together
account for two-thirds of the market capitalization of the 28
listed companies.
</P>
<P>
   Citing Padico's dual role as market player and manager, and lax
local rules on financial disclosure and insider trading, some
Palestinian businesses refuse to be listed on the exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can I trust it?'' asked Mazen Sinokrot, a candy maker in
Ramallah, whose family business has diversified into animal feed
and real estate. ``You are my competitor, and you also control the
stock market? You have information about my company, but I don't
have information about yours?''
</P>
<P>
   What most irks Sinokrot is that he and other local entrepreneurs
did not have a place at the table when Arafat and Padico's founders
devised their projects, like the plan for a telecommunications
monopoly. ``We were never given the same opportunity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Paltel president Hatem al-Halawani, who earlier served five
years as Padico's chief executive, argues that by limiting itself
to a minority holding in Paltel and selling shares to the public _
a Palestinian first _ Padico provided ample openings for local
investors. ``We could have taken 50 or 60 percent if we wanted
to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And Padico's original mandate, notes Amin Haddad, until recently
Padico's vice president and spokesman, was to create investment
opportunities for expatriates.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, with local political control about to pass to
the Palestinian Authority, Masri returned here from London at
Arafat's invitation, joining his first cabinet and helping to
assemble Padico. With the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord just
months old, it was a time of heady optimism, but also of few local
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept was to build the Palestinian economy,'' Masri
said, ``and to make a decent profit, but not an exorbitant profit.
And what we did was clean; it was over the table.''
</P>
<P>
   With Arafat's endorsement, Masri and other expatriates courted
Palestinian investors from Europe, the Americas and throughout the
Middle East. A key recruit was the Amman-based but
Palestinian-owned Arab Bank, the Arab world's fourth largest.
Others followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to convince people to put 3 or 4 percent of
their wealth into a country where they will be able to raise their
children,'' Masri said.
</P>
<P>
   The group raised about $150 million initially and backed the new
company with $1 billion. Each founding investor was limited to a 2
percent share. Last year, Padico directors made what they said was
a one-time exception, accepting $10 million from Prince Walid bin
Talal, the Saudi billionaire.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Padico is a holding company of fairly standard design,
modest dimensions and meager profits. The core company and its
majority-owned subsidiaries have about 100 professional employees
scattered across the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. On the
Palestinian exchange, Padico's market capitalization hovers around
$190 million, not all that much more than its reported $84 million
in paid-in capital. Until a recent 1,000-for-one split, Padico
shares sold for $1,000 each, discouraging most local interest.
</P>
<P>
   Padico's 1998 report, released at its annual meeting in April,
includes a summarized audit by Arthur Andersen showing net assets
of just $122 million and an after-tax profit last year of $2.7
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some unhappy investors,'' Haddad acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   But such figures belie Padico's true importance here. The
company says it manages some $500 million in additional assets for
its partners, including the Palestinian Authority. And the personal
wealth of its board members is ``about $20 billion,'' Haddad
estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Even allowing for exaggeration, the assets of Padico's
expatriate founders loom extraordinarily large in a $3 billion
economy. And some holdings give Padico significant profit
potential, analysts say, pointing to its 10 percent share of a new
Gaza electric company and 23 percent of Paltel.
</P>
<P>
   Few foreign investors are ready to wade into the shallow and
murky waters of Palestinian finance, but Padico and Paltel are
considered the most viable eventual candidates for international
stock portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at emerging markets, it is almost always the case
at the beginning that a few companies will account for most of the
capitalization,'' said Angus Blair, head of equity research for the
Middle East at ABN Amro in London. ``Invariably, telecoms and
holding companies are going to be very important.''
</P>
<P>
   The London-based emerging markets department of Nomura, the
giant Japanese brokerage house, is now preparing what Padico says
will be the first thorough independent assessment of the company,
in conjunction with a Jordanian investment banking firm.
</P>
<P>
   But prospective investors may receive the report somewhat
skeptically. The owner and managing director of Nomura's Jordanian
partner, Atlas Investment Group, is Omar Masri, Munib Masri's son.

MICROSOFT LAWYER QUESTIONS AOL EXECUTIVE ON ACQUISITION OF NETSCAPE
BROWSER 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Microsoft lawyer tried to make the case Wednesday
that America Online plans to use ``all of its marketing muscle'' to
promote its newly acquired product, the Netscape Navigator Web
browser. But an America Online executive disputed that, saying the
company thinks ``the browser business is dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The back and forth came this morning as Microsoft took the
deposition of Barry Schuler, the president for interactive services
at America Online, in preparation for the resumption of the
antitrust trial late this month.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft plans to make the case in court that America Online's
purchase of the Netscape Communications Corp. for $10 million this
year seriously undermines the government's argument that Microsoft
is a monopolist with no serious competition. If America Online
stepped up Netscape's competition with Microsoft's browser, that
could seem to support this assertion.
</P>
<P>
   Quoting from company documents obtained by subpoena, a Microsoft
lawyer, Steven Holley, noted that one America Online executive had
proposed in December to increase marketing of Netscape's browser _
perhaps, Holley said, even using direct mail to send out millions
of copes of the software, as America Online has done with its own
software.
</P>
<P>
   Schuler called the executive's suggestion ``just his opinion,''
not company policy, adding that America Online ``is not actually
considering'' direct-mail marketing of Navigator.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases it was hard to know which of Holley's assertions
came from America Online documents that Microsoft had obtained and
which might have been his own suggestions because America Online
tried to insist that every document be marked as confidential _
even newspaper clippings and news releases. Holley managed to
persuade the America Online lawyer to take the confidential
markings off the newspaper clippings.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Schuler insisted that America Online had little
interest in Netscape's browser. The company was much more
interested in Netscape's Internet portal business, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The broswer business had been decimated, he said, by Microsoft's
decision to bundle a competing browser with the Windows operating
system that is installed on more than 90 percent of the world's
personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Holley spent most of the morning questioning Schuler about the
timing of America Online's decisions in the purchase of Netscape.
He tried to force Schuler to acknowledge that an America Online
lawyer had informed David Boies, the lead Justice Department
lawyer, about the company's proposed acquisition of Netscape in
early October, before the antitrust trial began, but then kept it
secret from the government and the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Murray, a Microsoft spokesman, said, ``If that was the
case, it would cast the testimony of Netscape and AOL witnesses in
a very different light.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft plans to call David Colburn, a senior America Online
executive, as a hostile witness and question him about his earler
testimony in the trial and how it related to the acquisition plans.
</P>
<P>
   But Schuler said George Vradenburg, a senior company lawyer, had
simply told Boies on Oct. 3 that America Online and Netscape were
involved in ``a very preliminary conversation of a sensitive nature
about a potential commercial relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Vradenburg and Boies are former law partners, and Boies was
preparing to take a deposition from Colburn that day. America
Online says Vradenburg wanted to make sure Boies did not stumble
into that confidential area.
</P>
<P>
   This Oct. 3 discussion is a central piece of evidence behind
Microsoft's assertion that America Online, Netscape and the
government plotted, in essence, to keep the proposed deal from
Microsoft and the judge until the other companies' witnesses
completed their trial testimony.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Justice Department official said Boies and government
lawyers had taken Vradenburg's imprecise remark on Oct. 3 to mean
that America Online was considering using Netscape in its online
service, adding, ``for the life of me I don't quite understand the
relevance of this.''
</P>
<P>
   But Murray added, ``These issues will be a significant part of
our rebuttal case.''
</P>
<P>
   When a government lawyer, Philip R. Malone, got his turn to
question Schuler, he asked whether America Online and Netscape had
``delayed or postponed'' their acquisition agreement ``because of
any concern about the impact it might have on the trial.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we did not,'' Schuler said.

THESE IMAGINARY VIDEO GAMES REALLY ROCK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bands and video games have always, for some reason, made for
frequent _ albeit very strange _ bedfellows. Remember that Journey
game for the Atari 2600, ``Journey Escape?'' Band members fled a
rock concert, with ``Don't Stop Believin''' playing in the
background, and you had to help them avoid crazed groupies and
scummy agents. You do know what we're talking about, right? Anyone?
</P>
<P>
   More recent attempts at turning rock stars into Marios have been
just as disastrous: That Spice Girls game for the Sony PlayStation
was more hideous than humorous. And the recent announcement of an
in-time-for-Christmas Wu-Tang Clan fighting game for PlayStation _
an as-yet unnamed game in which the rap group fights its way from
ancient China to Staten Island in New York City _ looks like
another Mortal Kombat clone.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if we had our way we'd come out with some really cool,
``Behind the Music''-style video games featuring rock stars. Such
as:
</P>
<P>
   Game title: ODB Breakout
</P>
<P>
   Starring: Always-in-hot-water rapper Ol' Dirty B------.
</P>
<P>
   Game description: In this spinoff from the Wu-Tang Clan game,
you help WTC member ODB break out of jail in time to make his
CD-release party. This is a two-player game: One controls ODB, the
other ODB's girlfriend, YCM (Young Coochie Mama). To escape, they
must blackmail, dodge or beat up jail guards with plastic spoons
from the cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   Tips: You'll need a cell phone to complete the mission (try the
warden's office). How else are ya gonna reach your limo driver to
come pick ya up?
</P>
<P>
   Rating: Age 17 and up for violence, as well as language, which
mostly comes from the background music.
</P>
<P>
   Game title: Find Your Way Back
</P>
<P>
   Starring: '60s acid-rock band Jefferson Airplane
</P>
<P>
   Game description: A flight simulator in which players must try
to control a plane that is as disoriented and high as the band was
in 1969. The longer the plane flies, the more wavy-gravy it
becomes. Especially difficult is the hallucination level, in which
players must evade such ``whoa, dude'' obstacles as flying cows and
an airborne Titanic while the Airplane morphs into a Starship.
</P>
<P>
   Tips: One pill makes you larger, the other makes you smaller.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: Age 13 and up. Feel-good '90s message stamped on each
game: Talk to your kids about drugs before they talk to you about
them.
</P>
<P>
   Game title: Doomed
</P>
<P>
   Starring: Cutie-pie pop pinups Backstreet Boys, Five, 'N Sync,
98 Degrees
</P>
<P>
   Game description: You're walking around an arena, zapping
members of pop acts Backstreet Boys and 98 Degrees _ as well as
their crazed fans _ minutes before they're to perform. If you don't
tag every member, they'll go on to the next town to play, and we
don't want that, do we?
</P>
<P>
   Tips: Enlist the help of Donnie Wahlberg, former New Kid on the
Block. He's got plenty of time on his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: Age 17 and up for graphic _ but pretty funny _ violence.
</P>
<P>
   Game title: Stoned Temple Pilot
</P>
<P>
   Starring: Admitted former drug addict and lead singer Scott
Weiland
</P>
<P>
   Game description: After several years, STP singer Scott Weiland
is finally clean. For one night, you are his manager, and you must
keep him in sight so he can perform a concert without passing out.
This, of course, is not easy. While you're on the phone trying to
persuade club owners to book him and journalists to interview him,
Weiland tries to sneak off to neighborhood crack houses and liquor
stores.
</P>
<P>
   Tips: On the hidden bonus level, try to find and flush as much
of Weiland's smack as you can. For each bag, you'll gain tools to
help keep Scott in check, such as handcuffs and long-sleeved
shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: All ages. Minimal violence, but graphic scenes of Scott
going through unsightly withdrawal symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Game title: The Marilyn Manson Makeover
</P>
<P>
   Starring: Ghoulish schlock-rocker Marilyn Manson
</P>
<P>
   Game description: In the vein of Barbie's dress-me-up CD-ROMS
comes this fun little title in which players help Mr. Manson with
his new makeover. Select clothes, makeup and hairstyles for a brand
new look, such as the earnest, coffeehouse folkie or Vegas-bound,
suit-and-tie wash-up.
</P>
<P>
   Tips: Injections and implants can be used to adjust the size of
his head, feet and, if you so desire, breasts.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: Age 13 and up only. They don't want anyone suing because
their kids had nightmares about this guy.
</P>
<P>
   Remember: WE MADE UP ALL THESE GAMES. You can't buy them
anywhere. Don't call us asking where to find them.

WEB AIDS HUNT FOR RELATIVES IN BALKANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 LEE HILL KAVANAUGH  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Tears well up in Fatmira Beka's eyes as the
computer images slowly download. Scenes of children wandering in
rubble. Distraught, dirty faces. Sorrow and suffering.
</P>
<P>
   For Beka, a 20-year-old Kosovar Albanian, each photo, image or
TV broadcast is another opportunity to learn a shred of news about
the whereabouts of her grandfather, uncles and cousins she and her
family left behind in Kosovo. The Bekas moved to Kansas City a year
ago, after fleeing to Germany six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not heard from them in two months,'' she said. ``We
have heard bad things they do to men. I want every day to know how
my family is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross might be able to help.
</P>
<P>
   Through Web site technology the organization is trying to help
Beka and others find loved ones in Kosovo with a few keystrokes
online.
</P>
<P>
   On April 15, the Red Cross posted an interactive Web site called
the Displaced Persons Linking Center. The site is at (BEGIN
BOLDFACE)www.redcross.org(END BOLDFACE).
</P>
<P>
   Red Cross officials hope the site will produce connections soon.
Gathering information from refugees is a massive undertaking
because they rarely have identification and frequently are on the
move.
</P>
<P>
   The site has two screens of questions. Some of the personal
questions, such as birth dates of relatives, Beka couldn't answer.
But there are boxes available for guessing, too.
</P>
<P>
   The search data requires many questions because English
spellings for names can vary greatly from Slavic ones. Although
users can scan in photos of family members, Beka has no photos _
her family took few personal items when they left Kosovo in the
dead of night after her father had been beaten by Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The information that Red Cross volunteers enter about refugees
from the Yugoslavian border camps will be cross-referenced with
data entered on the Web site to look for matches.
</P>
<P>
   Matches will be reported to the local Red Cross agency of the
family or friend searching for that refugee, said Richard Liles,
family services manager at the Greater Kansas City Red Cross
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there is a match, we will get in touch with the people
looking, either by calling them or maybe telling them in person,''
he said. ``There haven't been any matches yet, but we're expecting
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross also is prepared to pass messages back and forth
from the refugee camps to the families, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it's letting the family know everyone's all right or
setting in motion the process of moving them to the United States,
the Red Cross will provide that line of communication,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One concern for refugees considering revealing private
information on themselves is who will see the data, said Doug
Rekenthaler, a spokesman at the Red Cross national headquarters in
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very mindful of security,'' he said. ``Even the local
Red Cross chapters don't have access to it. This is not information
that anyone can tap into. It's like a giant census project forced
by unfortunate circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Creating lines of communication between families in times of
disasters or war has been a goal of the Red Cross since the 1870s.
Internet technology offers a way to expedite that process and maybe
alleviate some of the suffering of displaced families, Rekenthaler
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to get this up and running now,'' he said. ``Not
only will this technology help the refugees, it has applications
down the road for other disasters.''
</P>
<P>
   Rekenthaler was frustrated that the technology wasn't working
sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have really helped if we had this for the Hurricane
Mitch disaster in Honduras,'' he said. ``Right now, we have 10,000
dead and 5,000 still missing. We might have had more answers for
families with this service.''
</P>
<P>
   For Beka and her family, this service offers hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can really understand how it is to think that someone
from your blood is hungry or cold or hurting,'' she said. ``Thank
you America and the Red Cross for helping us. I hope, I hope, I
hope America helps us until this is over.''

FOR EX-PRESIDENT'S SON, NAME'S BIG PART OF GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With big leads in the polls and big bucks in the bank, Texas
Gov. George W. Bush is, by any measure, the front-runner for the
Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But one question won't go away: What if he wasn't the son of the
former president?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he'd still be hot stuff. And maybe he wouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``If his name was Governor Smith, he might not be so popular,''
said Bruce Buchanan, a political scientist at the University of
Texas. ``A lot of this is name recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent poll in New Hampshire showed exactly that. Described
generically to voters without using his name, Bush saw his lead
fall by 14 points, twice as much as any other candidate.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't that Bush lacks distinction. Last November, he became
the first Lone Star State governor to be re-elected in 24 years,
and he did it in a landslide, winning 69 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   And, in an unusual twist, Texas Democrats praise him. Bush, 52,
has won national notice for his ability to win votes from groups,
such as Hispanics, that traditionally have been in the Democratic
camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without question, he's the best governor I ever worked with,''
said former Democratic Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock, a brusque political
veteran from central Texas. ``I admire him, and I respect him.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush's popularity has spread beyond Texas, Bush himself
has stayed put, keeping a low profile while reaping endorsements
and contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is gearing up to launch his national campaign in Iowa and
New Hampshire next month. Few observers expect him to waltz to the
nomination as easily as he shot to the head of the Republican pack
in the early going.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not an optimistic person about his candidacy,'' said Bob
Stein, a Rice University political scientist in Houston who has
watched Bush closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think there's lots and lots of unresolved questions
here,'' said Charles Cook, a Washington political analyst.
</P>
<P>
   One is Bush's relative inexperience in public service. The
governorship is, after all, his first public office.
</P>
<P>
   Another is his ability to straddle both wings of his party. Bush
is anti-abortion, for instance, but anti-abortion leaders are
skeptical of his commitment to their cause. His ``compassionate
conservative'' themes could prove mushy in a GOP that has tilted
hard right in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   One more question mark hangs over past behavior:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be the first to admit that I did irresponsible things when
I was young and irresponsible,'' the governor has said on more than
one occasion _ always declining to explain exactly what.
</P>
<P>
   His supporters expect Bush to remain more cautious than some of
his rivals. No need to go out on a limb when you're cruising in the
polls, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Every move Bush makes comes under scrutiny. The governor
endorsed a contentious gun-control measure in the Texas
Legislature, but did so only after the Littleton, Colo., shootings.
Now, Democrats criticize him for so quickly dropping it.
</P>
<P>
   In April, The Wall Street Journal called Bush's statement on
Kosovo ``a model of obfuscation'' and derided his halting
performance in answering questions. The Journal concluded that Bush
may not be ready for the big time.
</P>
<P>
   During the Clinton impeachment crisis, Bush took the small step
of saying he felt embarrassed for the country. But even those words
got slapped back in his face. Lanny Davis, a Clinton adviser who
attended Yale with Bush, said on national television that Bush
``shouldn't throw stones.''

   ... ``shouldn't throw stones.''
</P>
<P>
   That Bush is drawing so much attention reflects his unquestioned
status as the GOP front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   He's garnered more endorsements from elected GOP officials than
any other candidate. Already 15 governors, including Kansas' Bill
Graves, have announced their backing along with eight senators,
dozens of House members and hundreds of state lawmakers, including
a majority of GOPers in the Missouri General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   He's also collected the most money in a crowed GOP field.
</P>
<P>
   Bush raised $7.6 million through March 31, and took in $3.5
million more in April alone. At that pace, he could reach the $20
million threshold by July.
</P>
<P>
   Such success is fueling speculation that he will forgo federal
matching funds, a move that will free him to spend as much as he
wants in any state. The tactic would help him compete with
billionaire publisher Steve Forbes, a GOP presidential rival, who
in 1996 became the only major contender in recent years to refuse
federal aid.
</P>
<P>
   History, however, is littered with early leaders who fell short
because they became everyone's prime target.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not unusual for hot front-runners to get into
troubleespecially for one as untested as Bush,'' Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the doubts, the governor will be a formidable
candidate. A man of nervous intensity, Bush defeated a popular
Democrat, incumbent Ann Richards, in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   It was Richards who once described the elder Bush as born ``with
a silver foot in his mouth.'' The feisty Democrat didn't hold back
against the younger Bush, either, calling him ``Shrub,'' ``that
young Bush boy'' and ``some jerk.''
</P>
<P>
   Showing a seasoned maturity, Bush laughed off the lines and
stuck like glue to a four-point platform: more control for local
school districts, welfare reform, tougher juvenile-justice laws and
tort reform.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican landslides of '94 helped Bush turn a tight race
into a surprisingly easy win. He beat Richards 53 to 46 percent and
immediately went to work turning his campaign promises into law. He
succeeded in passing legislation that addressed all four of his
chief planks during his first session.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets results,'' said state Sen. Buster Brown, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   His successes were generally described as equivalent to hitting
a series of singles. Bush went for the long ball in 1997 when he
proposed an ambitious $3-billion-a-year cut in local property
taxes, partly offset by new taxes to finance the schools.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats liked the plan; many Republicans hated it. In the end,
the proposal was whittled back to a $1 billion property-tax cut,
hardly a massive cut in a state the size of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Members of both parties describe Bush as difficult to dislike.
He is respectful. He listens. And he is ingratiating, often
greeting lawmakers with a self-styled nickname. Sen. Teel Bivins is
``Bivy.'' Sen. Florence Shapiro is ``Flo-Jo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He does have a way of expressing himself when he does not
agree with you,'' Brown said. ``He's very honest. He doesn't hide
his position from you. You understand him.''
</P>
<P>
   It is somewhat ironic that the GOP could find itself turning to
a man named Bush to reclaim the presidency. After all, the elder
Bush lost the White House to Clinton at a time when the GOP had
made winning the White House an almost routine event.
</P>
<P>
   But those who know them say the younger Bush is a different man
than his father. George W., who spent years struggling to get out
of his father's shadow, has a harder edge and may be more
conservative. And, some say, the governor learned from his father's
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Stein at Rice University says Bush's assets and liabilities
stand out clearly. While he admires Bush's centrist politics and
the courage of his more inclusive policies, he notes the lack of
experience and depth of knowledge on the issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a big question mark,'' Stein said. ``If he became
president, I'd be nervous. I'd pay a whole lot of attention to who
he picks for his Cabinet.''

FATE PLACED PREDATOR IN CRYSTAL KIPPER'S PATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 OSCAR AVILA AND BENITA Y. WILLIAMS  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Both Crystal Kipper and John E. Williams had
made the late-night run down Interstate 29 many times.
</P>
<P>
   Kipper, enjoying her first days as an adult, would coax her 1989
Ford Probe toward her Gladstone, Mo., apartment after a night out.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, filled with sexual frustration, would slink home from
Leavenworth, Kan., after another unsuccessful tryst with his
girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Kipper and Williams shared the highway on Feb. 24, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Williams told authorities he accidentally hit Kipper with his
car as she stood on the shoulder. Police say he killed her and
disposed of her body.
</P>
<P>
   What if Kipper had listened to her friends and filled her gas
tank before driving to St. Joseph, Mo., to take a friend home? What
if Williams had been fiddling with the radio and not noticed her on
the roadside?
</P>
<P>
   What if?
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Star has obtained more than 2,500 pages of
investigative files that showed how fate brought Williams and
Kipper together.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews, letters, calls to the TIPS hot line and other clues
in the files shed light on the lives of Williams and Kipper, as
well as how authorities were shaping the case in her disappearance
and the lengths Kipper's mother went to in trying to find her
missing daughter.
</P>
<P>
   But after Williams hanged himself in the Jackson County Jail
nine days ago, many questions still remain.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks before that Feb. 24, Kipper and Williams were
trying to find their places in the world and deal with change.
</P>
<P>
   Loved ones say Kipper, 18, had overcome early rebellion and had
rediscovered her faith.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, Kipper always seemed to need money: for traffic
tickets, for clothes and, down the road, for college.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why she had answered an ad for dancers shortly
after her 18th birthday. She danced at Ziegfield's for about two
months in the summer of 1996. Kipper quit when her mother asked her
to leave the downtown adult entertainment club.
</P>
<P>
   She then made some changes in her life.
</P>
<P>
   She attended church with a rededication to her faith and began
working double shifts at the Tippin's restaurant on North Oak
Street. At the time she disappeared, she was two days away from
taking jazz and tango dance lessons.
</P>
<P>
   She had planned a trip to Springfield, Mo., to visit a young man
she recently met at a gospel service.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, on the other hand, was continuing patterns that he had
established early in life.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was 16, he had abducted a Leavenworth boy, killed
him and buried him by railroad tracks. When he was released from
juvenile custody, he sodomized another boy.
</P>
<P>
   The move to a downtown Kansas City high-rise didn't provide the
change in life that Williams had been looking for. He found a job
at a North Kansas City printer but he was virtually without
friends, and his nights were lonely.
</P>
<P>
   In one letter to a friend, he wrote: ``I am getting tired of
coming home to nothing each and every night. It is not like I am
not trying to make any friends. It seems like that everyone is
always in a hurry and if they are not in a hurry, they look at you
like they think you are the Boston Strangler.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have come to the conclusion that Kansas City is a very
depressing town,'' Williams wrote in another letter.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Williams started dating a Leavenworth woman. She
said he was a tender and gentle man. But Williams could not perform
sexually and he would often leave her home about 2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't remember whether he was with her on Feb. 24.
</P>
<P>
   That February night, Kipper drove to St. Joseph to pick up a
friend, Jay Sampson. They picked up two other friends in Riverside.
</P>
<P>
   The four trekked to Crown Center about 11 p.m. Sampson had never
seen the waterfall or traversed the skywalk the shopping and office
complex.
</P>
<P>
   The four stayed until midnight, then headed to Kansas City,
North, where Kipper drove to a gas station at 58th Street and North
Oak Trafficway. She pointed out a cute guy, but was afraid her
friends would tease her if she stopped.
</P>
<P>
   She drove away without buying gas.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Schmitt, one of the friends in the car that night, said
Kipper didn't mind driving Sampson back to St. Joseph at 1 a.m.
Kipper dropped Schmitt and Schmitt's boyfriend off in Riverside,
Mo.
</P>
<P>
   The low-fuel warning on Kipper's maroon Ford Probe lit up on the
way to St. Joseph, but Kipper said she got good mileage on her car
and refused Sampson's offer to buy gas. She had miscalculated
before. Her AAA service had brought gas to her three times in the
previous two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had constantly told her to stop running around with her fuel
running low,'' said Kipper's mother, Anna Kipper. ``In some ways, I
think she was pushing the envelope there and thought she was
invincible by thinking she could make it on so little gas.''
</P>
<P>
   Kipper and Sampson made it to St. Joseph, 50 miles north.
Sampson told Kipper that if she didn't call him by 3 a.m., he would
call and make sure she made it home.
</P>
<P>
   It was 2 a.m. when Kipper left St. Joseph.
</P>
<P>
   Sampson fell asleep.
</P>
<P>
   Kipper never called.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the last person to see Kipper before she met her killer
was an Associated Foods truck driver who saw a car with its
flashers on sitting on the southbound shoulder of Interstate 29
after 2:34 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Another car was backing up the on ramp toward the stranded car.
</P>
<P>
   As the truck driver passed the cars, he saw a dark-haired white
female flagging traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Her face was stressed and concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Kipper's mother found the abandoned car the next morning, its
battery dying and hazard lights blinking.
</P>
<P>
   Kipper was gone.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Williams went to a Gladstone shop to have his
windshield fixed.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, authorities who had been contacted about Kipper's
disappearance had no reason to even know who John E. Williams was.
</P>
<P>
   The following day, Platte County Sheriff's Capt. Bill Taylor
interviewed six persons. Kipper's Sunday school teacher took her
picture to businesses near the area where the Probe had been found.

COMMENTARY: THE BIGGEST PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I believe the voucher system in New York City would be very,
very troublesome,'' said Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in a speech to the
Wharton Club of New York in August 1995. ``Our system is so large
that making that kind of transition would pose tremendous
difficulties. Not to mention the constitutional and legal
difficulties that would be entailed in providing tax relief and tax
dollars for religious education.''
</P>
<P>
   Vouchers would ``weaken, if not create the collapse of the New
York City public school system,'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   That was then. Now, as he tries to impress fellow Republicans
and win a U.S. Senate seat, he's in favor of vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor was once a champion of Rudy Crew, the schools
chancellor, and claimed to be a close friend. But that was then.
Now he publicly treats Crew like yesterday's garbage and says the
school system should be blown up.
</P>
<P>
   The chancellor before Crew was a decent and popular and
competent man named Ramon Cortines. Giuliani publicly humiliated
him and ran him out of town.
</P>
<P>
   The school system in New York has an insurmountable problem, and
his name is Rudolph Giuliani. There will be no substantial
improvement in the schools until he leaves City Hall and takes his
crazy-making behavior elsewhere. By that time the shell-shocked
Crew will most likely be gone, too. Few tears will be shed. There
are worse things than a fresh start.
</P>
<P>
   Right now the schools are being treated cruelly. The latest
mantra is higher standards. The people chanting the loudest (
Giuliani foremost among them) must get a perverse kick out of
conning the city's 1.1 million students, because anybody with a
brain would know that we don't provide the system with anywhere
near the resources necessary to meet existing standards.
</P>
<P>
   In his first three years in office Giuliani drained more than $2
billion out of the system. He didn't start replacing that money
until he had to run for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Messinger, who ran against Giuliani for mayor, complained
in her campaign about overcrowding so severe that children were
being taught in lavatories. Randi Weingarten, the president of the
United Federation of Teachers, said this week: ``I remember when I
was still teaching in 1995 and 1996, there were times when I had to
go scavenging for chalk. I would go from room to room, and nobody
had any chalk.''
</P>
<P>
   Conditions are not as extreme now, but the schools are still
hurting badly. New York City spends about $8,000 annually per pupil
compared with the $12,000 spent by the average downstate suburb.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have small enough class sizes, we don't pay our
teachers enough, and on and on,'' said Carol Gresser, a former
Board of Education president who was also publicly ridiculed by
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   The first step toward a quality education is a well-prepared
teacher. The city has more than 10,000 uncertified teachers in its
schools, well over 10 percent of the total. Ms. Weingarten helped
put that in perspective when she noted that there were probably
only 500 uncertified teachers on the job throughout the rest of the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Crew is moving to end social promotions, which could lead in the
short term to 300,000 students being left back. And the state is
imposing tough new Regents requirements that, by 2003, will require
all graduating high school students to pass stringent Regents
examinations. Just one of every five New York City students is
passing the current exams and graduating with a Regents diploma.
</P>
<P>
   As the Community Service Society noted: ``School districts
unable to prepare the majority of students to demonstrate mastery
of rudimentary skills are now asked to prepare students to
demonstrate a far more complex set of skills _ in English, global
studies, U.S. history, math and biology _ in just five years.''
</P>
<P>
   The tough work of preparing children to meet higher academic
standards requires a huge long-term commitment and lots and lots of
money. Neither Giuliani nor anyone else will say how that
commitment is to be carried out and from where that money will
come.
</P>
<P>
   The simple fact is that Giuliani is trying to get to Washington,
and he's ready to walk all over the public school students of New
York to get there.  &QL;

<P>
   ... where the Probe had been found.
</P>
<P>
   No one, it seemed, had seen Crystal Kipper.
</P>
<P>
   The police searched the area on foot and by helicopter. They
brought in dogs and searched the nearby Platte River.
</P>
<P>
   They found nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation began to focus on those who were among the
last to see Kipper _ her friends.
</P>
<P>
   All three were given voice stress tests. All three passed.
</P>
<P>
   Early leads went nowhere. Detectives reached a quick standstill.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, meanwhile, continued life as usual.
</P>
<P>
   He sparred with his boss. He wrote letters containing reviews of
computer programs and tirades against black people.
</P>
<P>
   Inside his apartment, Williams was amassing a stash of
pornography, including pictures of children. Into some of the
pornographic videotapes he had spliced television news reports of
Kipper's disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   Still, police knew nothing of Williams and his activities. He
had not come to their attention, and might never have surfaced had
he not kidnapped Angela Amos on July 5 and tortured her and raped
her over a 10-day period before she escaped.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe authorities would have found Williams anyway. Maybe he
would have slipped up. Or maybe the clues to Kipper's disappearance
would have remained Williams' secret forever.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't, because Amos was able to escape on July 14. She
told police about a man who bound her head with a bicycle lock,
smothered her until she passed out and threatened to inject her
with battery acid.
</P>
<P>
   Amos said he told her that he knew how to dispose of a body.
</P>
<P>
   With Amos' escape, Williams' problems intensified. That night,
he arrived at his ex-girlfriend's house shaking, sweating and sick.
</P>
<P>
   She said he was ``acting really weird _ more than normal.''
</P>
<P>
   He told her: ``The only way out of this for me is''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed his index finger to his head and pulled the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, police entered Williams' apartment with a passkey
and woke him. They were looking for padlocks, duct tape, wires and
weapons to implicate Williams in Amos' kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   They found a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Police discovered Crystal Kipper's ID cards, a paycheck stub,
jewelry, her car keys, a mock turtleneck and a pair of ``Lucky U''
brand jeans. They found a missing-person flier of Kipper, in
addition to computer files.
</P>
<P>
   But no blood. No body.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities had little hard evidence against Williams.
</P>
<P>
   With Williams in jail on the kidnapping charges, police got to
work.
</P>
<P>
   DNA tests confirmed that the clothes belonged to Kipper, but
showed no evidence of blood or semen.
</P>
<P>
   Police did have Williams' story about what happened that night.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was driving along I-29 when something struck his
windshield. When he returned, he found the ``remains.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he panicked because he was a convicted sex
offender. He said he put the body in his car, backed up and drove
``forever, to hell.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he disposed of the body. When asked where, Williams
replied cryptically that it didn't matter because the remains were
not on Earth and she was now ``part of the atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Williams led detectives to the Platte City area.
They drove around for two hours. Williams claimed he didn't
remember where he dumped the body. He acknowledged that his actions
caused Kipper's death.
</P>
<P>
   When police asked Williams about the windshield he fixed the
next day, Williams responded with an expletive and dropped his jaw.
His arms fell to the table. He denied that the windshield had been
broken by someone kicking it during a struggle. Authorities think
he was lying.
</P>
<P>
   An expert told police that damage to Kipper's clothes was
``consistent with a homicide,'' not someone having been struck by a
car.
</P>
<P>
   Police added the information to hundreds of tips they had
received that year. Some implicated other suspects. One man drew
authorities a map, saying he had a dream about Kipper's
whereabouts. A woman said she was a psychic who felt an urge to
find Kipper in some woods near Platte County.
</P>
<P>
   Anna Kipper did her part. Once, authorities met her along the
highway after her foraging discovered a piece of used duct tape.
Was it a clue?
</P>
<P>
   Other callers kept coming back to the fields of southern Platte
County.
</P>
<P>
   A man called the TIPS hot line and said he was driving on
Highway FF in the spring of 1997 when he saw Williams standing
outside a vehicle. He said Williams stared at him and made a
barking sound.
</P>
<P>
   A Kansas City man said he saw a ``very ugly'' man leaving the
woods that March along Missouri 45. He said the man tried to hide
his face by turning it toward his shoulder. The witness was one of
several who described a putrid odor from that area, smelling like a
dead, decaying body.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of a bait shop said she often sold equipment to
Williams, who fished on the Platte River. She thought Williams
fished at the bridge on Missouri 45.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives, meanwhile, were hearing from Williams' cellmates.
</P>
<P>
   One inmate said Williams had bragged about killing Kipper and
burying her near Worlds of Fun. Williams told him that he killed
her near where her body was buried. And Williams said he could not
be convicted in Missouri because police did not have a body.
</P>
<P>
   Another inmate said he had overheard Williams tell someone that
he killed Kipper. Again, Williams expressed confidence that no one
would find the body.
</P>
<P>
   But there were holes in the inmates' stories.
</P>
<P>
   One inmate said Williams told him about a lot of blood in the
vehicle. Police found none.
</P>
<P>
   In March of this year, authorities gave the evidence to
prosecutors, who said they planned to file formal charges this
month.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams intervened. On April 24, he hanged himself in jail,
even though he was on suicide watch. He left no suicide note, but
authorities think he knew he was about to be charged.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors were waiting for Kipper's mother to return from a
trip. She was on a cruise in the Pacific, trying to find peace.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' death means she might never find it. Authorities have
closed the case and Platte County Sheriff Dick Anderson said ``it
would probably be a coincidence if Kipper's body was located.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Anna Kipper's only memorial to her daughter is a white
cross along I-29, behind a hill that blocks out the lights of
Platte City.
</P>
<P>
   Fate brought Crystal Kipper and John Williams together. Chance
led her avengers to Williams' door.
</P>
<P>
   And now Anna Kipper thinks there is only one way her daughter
will ever be found so her family and friends can mourn her
properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take divine intervention at this point,'' she said.

in Slovinje, and 16 muddy corpses were laid out in a schoolroom.

 &HT;    Jackson tells of `journey of faith'
 &HT;    By Gayle White and Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At a news conference and luncheon speech that took on
the tones of a Sunday morning church service, the Rev. Jesse
Jackson told Atlantans on Wednesday that his recent trip to Kosovo
was ``a journey of faith rooted in prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Clergy and church leaders at Atlanta's Antioch Baptist Church
North responded loudly with ``amen'' and ``yes, sir,'' as Jackson
compared his meeting with Serbian President Slobodon Milosevic to
Moses's demand to pharoah in the Hebrew Bible's story of Exodus to
``let my people go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I went as a preacher of the gospel and the word had a
liberating power,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson headed a group of clergy who went to Yugoslavia last
week and emerged on Sunday with three American soldiers formerly
held captive by the Serbs. U.S. officials warned the ministers that
NATO bombing of Serbia would not cease while they were there,
Jackson said, ``but our group had to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has been criticized in some quarters for meeting with
Milosevic. In answer to accusations that he had been ``used'' by
the Serbian leader, Jackson said, ``We meant to be used and, if
necessary, sacrificed. . .''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, Jackson told the CNN World Report Conference,
an annual gathering of international journalists, ``We must break
the cycle of fear and give peace a chance. . . We must search for
an all-winners solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson cited several past peace initiatives, from Nixon's
ping-pong diplomacy to Carter's Camp David accord between Isreal
and Egypt. He said the current conflict needs ``just a little talk,
just a little daylight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're talking past each other,'' Jackson said of President
Bill Clinton and Milosevic. ``That's the gulf. That's why they need
the bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson emphasized he had visited Belgrade not as an emissary of
the United States government. ``I was a religious envoy, a moral
envoy. I was not there as a negotiator. I offered a possibility of
hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said he hoped his successful release of the prisoners
had not embarrassed Clinton. ``He is my president. He is my friend.
His options are different from mine.''
</P>
<P>
   At the church, Jackson emphasized that after ``forty days and
forty nights'' of NATO bombs falling on Serbia, NATO leaders should
re-evaluate their position. ``We're now at the crossroads in this
struggle . . . Bombs keep falling and the exodus continues. We
bomb, they purge. There's no talking.''
</P>
<P>
   Quoting from the Gospel of John, Jackson said, ``In the
beginning was the Word. The word speaks worlds into existence. With
no talk there is no change. With no talk, there is no hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson condemned the persecution of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo
that provoked the NATO bombing of Serbia. ``What Milosovic is doing
is unconscionable,'' he said. And, he characterized as ``morally
sound'' the U.S. demands that Milosevic stop the violence against
the Kosovars, repatriate those who have been exiled and accept an
international peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, rather than escalating the military effort to
involve ground troops, NATO leaders should step back and attempt a
diplomatic solution.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, a former presidential candidate, said he has decided to
keep his emphasis on his own role as a minister and not to run for
president. ``Politics by its nature drives you toward consensus and
conformity,'' he said. ``Religion drives you toward conscience and
conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   To be faithful means to take chances, he said. ``The gospel is
more difficult to live than to preach, but more rewarding.''

THIS IS NO ORDINARY GARDEN SPOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 MIKE HENDRICKS  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The lady of the house demanded the big geraniums.
</P>
<P>
   Not those puny ones you find at the stores this time of year.
But big, honking geraniums in the three-gallon pots, and to heck
with the cost. The yard simply had to look like the Fourth of July,
even if it was barely May.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the party they're planning, it has to be an instant
garden,'' Kathi Krouch, a gardener with Uncommon Grounds Inc.,
explained as we stood in the driveway of the house on Mission
Drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectations are very high here.''
</P>
<P>
   But of course. Expectations are always high in Mission Hills,
Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Lovely Mission Hills, the garden spot of Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Early this century, J.C. Nichols designed his premier
subdivision not just as a haven for the rich. Not just as a place
of narrow lanes lined with Mediterranean-style villas and castles
of ivy-covered brick.
</P>
<P>
   Mission Hills was to be more than that.
</P>
<P>
   It was to be a community within a garden. Around each curve, a
pleasant vista.
</P>
<P>
   Mission Hills remains true to Nichols' vision. It's a suburban
Eden encompassing 1,343 acres abutting State Line Road.
</P>
<P>
   In some parts of town, you're lucky the neighbors clip the weeds
before they go to seed.
</P>
<P>
   In Mission Hills, it's assumed the flower beds will be lush and
colorful, the grass as thick as a Persian rug, the trees pruned to
perfection.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're real particular,'' Don Birks of Kansas City said as he
dumped a bag of grass clippings into the back of his pickup. ``It's
good money around here. They don't care what it costs, just make it
look pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Cedar Creek may be pleasant. Hallbrook, oh so nice. But the
Mission Hills accounts are the ones the landscaping crews prefer
for the same reason the city's fortunate few choose to live there.
</P>
<P>
   Money and beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Monday through Friday, so many lawn and garden crews from around
the region park their rigs there that it's hard to squeeze through
the narrow lanes. On every block, you hear the sounds of leaf
blowers, mowers and weed whackers.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, Chris Jackson of Rosehill Gardens proudly
displayed muddy hands fresh from the flower beds of Don and Adele
Hall, the Halls of Hallmark fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have gorgeous yards to work in, gorgeous flowers,'' she
says. ``There's no limit to what it takes to make it look
beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it's a pleasant place to spend a day digging the bulbs
and trimming trees. But more than a few landscape workers wonder
whether their clients have as much time to enjoy the surroundings
as they do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people we work for are rarely at home,'' says Ron
Chiswell of Belton, who's been mowing lawns in Mission Hills for 25
years. ``You wonder why they have a yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's true of some, but not all are too busy to enjoy the
fruits of their fortunes. Many Mission Hills residents work closely
with the tree men and the spray crews and the sprinkler system
repair specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, on the day we met, Jackson was tending the vinca, per
the personal instructions of her company's high-profile client.
Jackson's understanding was that the yard was being primped for an
upcoming social affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Mrs. Hall picky about the weeds?'' I wondered.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, she doesn't care about the weeds,'' Jackson said, smiling,
``as long as she can't see them.''

   AUSTIN, Texas _ A Republican member of the Texas House accused
his own party Wednesday of pressuring state senators to prevent a
hate crimes proposal from reaching Gov. George W. Bush's desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very emotional issue for the Republican Party,''
said Rep. Tommy Merritt of Longview.
</P>
<P>
   The James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Act, named in memory the black
man who was dragged to death behind a truck last year in Jasper,
would toughen certain penalties for crimes that target people
because of their race, gender, sexual preference or religion. A
white man was convicted of murdering Byrd and two other men are
awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation was approved by the state House last week on a
83-61 vote. The House is controlled by Democrats while the Senate
has a Republican majority.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Criminal Justice Committee is expected to consider
the measure at a hearing Thursday, but its prospects before the
committee, as well as in the full Senate, are uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, said only one Republican senator
has even hinted he might vote for the measure if it makes it to the
full Senate. None of the four Republicans on the seven-member
Criminal Justice Committee has said he or she would support it,
Ellis added.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Wednesday, Merritt joined a group of
Democrats from the House and Senate to support the measure. He also
said he believes Republican senators are being pushed to vote
against the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe there has been pressure applied by the Republican
Party to prevent people from voting their districts, from voting
their convictions,'' Merritt said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Whitmire, D-Houston, suggested that presidential
politics was playing a role in the matter because of provisions in
the legislation covering crimes committed against people based on
their sexual preference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe obviously there are political considerations,''
Whitmire said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is leaning toward running for the Republican presidential
nomination next year, and could face attacks from social
conservatives in his party if he were to sign into law legislation
with a sexual preference provision.
</P>
<P>
   Bush wouldn't say Wednesday if he would sign such a measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will look at the bill when it comes off the floor of the
Senate to see if I can live with it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past, he has expressed some resistance to the
legislation, saying, ``All crime is hate.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the claims by Merritt, Texas GOP spokesman Robert Black
said he doesn't know of any effort by party officials to influence
GOP senators on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no pressure being exerted on anyone by the party,''
Black said. ``However, we've been very clear that the Republican
Party thinks the legislation is a very dangerous bill that would
create a justice system where one life is more important than
another. We don't think that's good public policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jeff Wentworth, R-San Antonio, said he has not been lobbied
by fellow Republicans on the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has told me how to vote on this issue,'' said
Wentworth, who plans to vote against the bill if it goes before the
full Senate. ``I am going to vote my conscience.''

   Pamela Gilberd learned from experience that getting fired isn't
always bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you lose your job, I congratulate you,'' she said. ``Now
you have a choice to do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   After a varied career in teaching, modeling and the airlines,
Gilberd worked for 10 years in marketing and sales for an umbrella
company.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her success, she was fired because of downsizing. Losing
her job was traumatic initially, but it forced her to re-evaluate
her life and make choices she wouldn't otherwise have made.
</P>
<P>
   It also motivated her to learn more about successful women and
to write about these individuals. She received 24 rejections and
wrote three book proposals before getting ``The Eleven Commandments
of Wildly Successful Women'' published.
</P>
<P>
   As Gilberd traveled the country lecturing and talking about the
book, she often encountered women with what she calls the ``woulda,
coulda, shoulda syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though these women were supportive and decisive with
friends and family, they suffered from chronic indecision,
self-criticism and self-doubt when it came to their own lives and
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The women already knew the answers to their questions, Gilberd
said. But they asked questions because they wanted someone to
validate their choices. They wanted someone to give them permission
to act on their intuition.
</P>
<P>
   Gilberd's newest book, ``The Twelfth Commandment of Wildly
Successful Women,'' is designed to help people make these tough
choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 12th commandment is to discover your own best answer,''
said Gilberd, who spoke recently at a local American Business
Women's Association Express Network meeting. ``They need to know
there are choices.''
</P>
<P>
   The book is divided into sections in which a composite character
must make a decision about work, family or other issues. Each
chapter includes four possible consequences that depend on the
decision someone makes.
</P>
<P>
   Gilberd hopes this will help readers make choices, since they
can see different consequences of their actions.
</P>
<P>
   She has several suggestions to help people make decisions. For
starters, release yourself from the coulda, woulda, shoulda
syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Recognize you have choices, and consider more than one option
before making up your mind.
</P>
<P>
   It's crucial to do your homework, she said. So arm yourself with
lots of information.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Gilberd recommends that you write a ``screenplay''
about your dilemma with several outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important of all, we need to trust ourselves.
Sometimes that's difficult. Sometimes people don't agree with our
decisions. But the worst possible choice we can make is not acting
at all.

MUCH BIGGER KOSOVO PEACEKEEPING FORCE WILL BE NEEDED, OFFICIALS
SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also KOSOVO-DIPLO) 
(bl) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY with ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ The NATO allies now believe they will need
nearly twice the 28,000 peacekeeping troops they originally planned
to station in Kosovo in a negotiated settlement, allied and U.S.
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and other NATO officials said the alliance would need
perhaps as many as 50,000 soldiers to enforce any Kosovo
settlement, even if NATO bombing eventually forced Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to accept allied demands to stop
attacking ethnic Albanian civilians in the province, withdraw
Serbian forces and let the refugees and peacekeepers enter
unopposed.
</P>
<P>
   Under NATO's original plan, the United States would have
contributed 4,000 soldiers to a peacekeeping force, but that number
is likely to grow substantially.
</P>
<P>
   Allied planners in Brussels and in Washington said more troops
would be necessary to quell scattered resistance from Serbian
paramilitary groups and to detect and destroy hundreds, if not
thousands, of land mines laid by Yugoslav forces. They would also
be needed to help begin rebuilding devastated villages in Kosovo, a
necessary step before hundreds of thousands of Kosovar Albanian
refugees can return.
</P>
<P>
   The allies have said the force could include soldiers from
Russia and other countries outside NATO if they wanted to take
part. NATO has taken to describing it as ``an international
presence with NATO at its core,'' under a United Nations Security
Council mandate, like the 20,000-member force in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Russian has already rejected one plan that was proposed early
and is still being mentioned by military planners, officials said.
Under this scenario, the international peacekeeping forces would
divide Kosovo into four sectors of responsibility. A northern
sector, adjacent to Serbia, would be monitored by Russia. The two
southern sectors, along the Albania and Macedonia borders, would be
overseen by NATO countries. The final sector, in between, would be
monitored by some neutral country.
</P>
<P>
   But a State Department official said Russia had rejected that
option during early discussions about the composition of a
peacekeeping force, arguing that the notion of sectors harkened
back to the Cold War and to a divided Germany.
</P>
<P>
   However it is organized, the force in Kosovo would have to be
far larger than 28,000, officials said Wednesday. ``A lot of
difficult tasks will be more onerous,'' a senior U.S. official
said. ``The force will likely have to be at least somewhat
larger.''
</P>
<P>
   Allied officials would not be specific about how large. But NATO
commanders denied Wednesday that there was any plan under active
consideration to send troops into Kosovo as long as Serbian forces
were still there and able to resist.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all a what-happens-if-we-win plan,'' a senior
administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   Allied spokesmen said NATO's two top military officers, Gen.
Wesley Clark of the United States and Gen. Klaus Naumann of
Germany, told President Clinton during his short visit to the
alliance's headquarters Wednesday that there was no reason to
abandon the allied strategy of bombing Serbian military forces and
installations until Milosevic gives in and lets more than a million
ethnic Albanian refugees go back to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   This strategy was chosen late last year after allied military
leaders worked out contingency plans to deal with the emerging
crisis. There are now more than a dozen such plans, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Among the options not chosen but kept on the shelf and
occasionally dusted off, allied officers say, is one that would
have required 200,000 soldiers before the bombing started to invade
Kosovo and drive out the 40,000 Serbian military and police forces
that have since expelled most of the province's ethnic Albanian
majority.
</P>
<P>
   Another option, subsequently ruled out, would have gone even
further with an allied invasion of Belgrade to force Milosevic to
capitulate, according to a senior allied official.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere between the 28,000 peacekeepers, including 4,000
Americans, who were to have gone into Kosovo if last winter's peace
negotiations at Rambouillet Castle in France had succeeded, and the
much larger force that would have been needed to fight the Serbs
out of Kosovo, is another option that allied commanders insist they
do not have under active consideration.
</P>
<P>
   That option would be to send in a few tens of thousands of
allied ground troops after more weeks of bombing had so demoralized
Milosevic's forces in Kosovo that they could not fight back
effectively.
</P>
<P>
   But officials say those troops would have to start going in by
midsummer to have any chance of letting more than 400,000 refugees
in Albania and nearly 140,000 in Macedonia, plus 650,000 people who
took to the hills in Kosovo, find permanent shelter in the province
before freezing weather sets in during the fall.
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair tried to persuade Clinton and
the other allies in Washington last month to put such an option
back on the front burner, allied officials said, but ran up against
resistance from U.S. commanders who insisted that it was not
realistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are winning,'' Clark told Clinton in Brussels on Wednesday.
``The leadership, its military and security forces and its support
infrastructure are vulnerable to collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, with Clinton in Spangdahlem Air Base in Germany, Clark
said there was not ``a bit of truth'' in a published report that
said NATO was preparing a plan to send 60,000 troops into Kosovo by
late July to take over the province and chase out the remaining
Yugoslav forces.
</P>
<P>
   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said just before the start
of the NATO summit in Washington in April that the alliance would
review and refresh all the various contingency plans for ground
troops. Solana and other officials in Brussels gave Clinton a
general progress report Wednesday on those updates, a senior U.S.
official said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the meantime Clark, using the NATO acronym for a Kosovo
peacekeeping force, said later Wednesday: ``There are a number of
reviews under way, and I suspect that one will be made available in
NATO in the near future to do with how the KFOR mission should be
further enhanced and modified, as we look at the changing situation
on the ground in Kosovo. That's the review that's hot on our plate
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Explaining the need for more than 28,000 peacekeepers in Kosovo
even if Milosevic finally accepts allied demands, a senior U.S.
official said, ``The force will now have the Herculean task of
returning one million refugees to their homes, and this will place
more demands on it than were originally planned for.''
</P>
<P>
   Peacekeepers would also now have to remove thousands of land
mines planted by Serbian forces all over Kosovo and oversee the
rebuilding of civilian houses that Serbian paramilitaries and
soldiers have partly destroyed or burned to discourage the ethnic
Albanians from trying to return.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crops have not been planted, so the food supply's not there,''
Clark said. ``Homes have been destroyed, roofs ripped off, houses,
apartments blown up, and whole villages apparently just
destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So even when they're allowed to go home, life won't be normal
for a while,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Taking care of refugees from Kosovo would be a task that
occupied the allies and international civilian aid agencies for
many months, he warned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that, yes, we have to look very much ahead, past the
summer, into the autumn, the winter and even the next spring,''
Clark said.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Normally, the great teaching hospitals of this medical
Mecca carry an air of white-coated, best-in-the-world arrogance,
the kind that comes of collecting Nobels, of snaring more federal
money for medical research than hospitals anywhere else, of
attracting patients from the four corners of the earth.
</P>
<P>
   But not lately. Lately, their chief executives carry an air of
pleading and alarm. They tend to cross the edges of their palms in
an X _ with one line symbolizing rising costs and the other
dropping payments, especially Medicare payments _ and say they
simply cannot go on losing money this way and remain the academic
cream of American medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mitchell T. Rabkin, chief executive emeritus of Beth Israel
Hospital: ``Everyone's in deep yogurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Otten, president of Brigham and Women's Hospital: ``Most
of the hospitals are losing money at a rate between a half-million
and a million dollars a week,'' though their beds are mostly full.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Samuel O. Thier, president of the group which owns
Massachusetts General Hospital: ``We've got a problem, and you've
got to nip it in the bud, or else you're going to kill off some of
the premier institutions in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The teaching hospitals here and elsewhere have never been fully
immune from the turbulent change sweeping American health care _
from the expansion of managed care to spiraling drug prices to the
fierce fights for survival and shotgun marriages between hospitals
with empty beds and flabby management.
</P>
<P>
   But they are contending that suddenly, in recent weeks, a
federal cutback in Medicare spending has begun putting such a
financial squeeze on them that it threatens their ability to
fulfill their special missions: to handle the sickest patients, to
act as incubators for new cures, to treat poor people and to train
budding doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The budget hemorrhaging has hit at scattered teaching hospitals
across the country, from San Francisco to Philadelphia. New York's
clusters of teaching hospitals are among the biggest and hardest
hit, the Greater New York Hospital Association says. It predicts
that Medicare cuts will cost the state's hospitals $5 billion
through 2002 and force the closure of money-losing departments and
whole hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Boston, with its unusual concentration of academic
medicine and its teaching hospitals affiliated with the medical
schools of Harvard, Tufts and Boston universities, the cuts are
already taking a toll in hundreds of eliminated jobs and pockets of
miserable morale.
</P>
<P>
   Five of Boston's top eight private employers are teaching
hospitals, Mayor Thomas M. Menino notes. And if five-year Medicare
cuts totaling an estimated $1.7 billion for Massachusetts hospitals
continue, Menino says, ``We'll have to lay off thousands of people,
and that's a big hit on the city of Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   Often, analysts say, hospital cutbacks, closings and mergers
make good economic sense, and some dislocation and pain are only to
be expected. Some critics say the hospitals are partly to fault,
that for all their glittery research and credentials, they have not
always been efficiently managed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of teaching hospitals have engaged in what might be
called self-sanctification _ `We're the greatest hospitals in the
world and no one can do it better or for less' _ and that may or
may not be true,'' said Alan Sager, a health-care finance expert at
the Boston University School of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   But hospital chiefs argue that they have virtually no fat left
to cut, and are warning that their financial problems could mean
that the smartest edge of American medicine would get dumbed down.
</P>
<P>
   With that message, they have been lobbying Congress in recent
weeks to reconsider the cuts that they say have turned their
financial straits from tough to intolerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years from now, the American people will wake up and find
their clinical research is second rate because the big teaching
hospitals are reeling financially,'' warned Dr. David G. Nathan,
president of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute here.
</P>
<P>
   In a half-dozen interviews around the Boston medical-industrial
complex known as the Longwood Medical Center and Academic Area and
elsewhere, hospital executives who normally compete and squabble
all espoused one central idea: Teaching hospitals are special, and
that specialness costs money.
</P>
<P>
   Take the example of treating heart-disease patients, said Dr.
Michael F. Collins, president and chief executive officer of
Caritas Christi Health Care System, a seven-hospital group
affiliated with Tufts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Collins said, it was still experimental for doctors to
open blocked arteries by passing tiny balloons though them; now,
they have a whole bouquet of expensive new options for those
patients, including spring-like devices called stents that cost
$900 to $1,850 each; tiny rotobladers that can cost up to $1,500,
and costly drugs to supplement the reaming that cost nearly $1,400
a patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of our scientists are doing research on which are the
best catheters and which are the best stents,'' Collins said. ``And
because they're giving the papers on the drug, they're using the
drug the day it's approved to be used. Right now it's costing us
about $50,000 a month and we're not getting a nickel for it,
because our case rates are fixed.''
</P>
<P>
   Hospital chiefs and doctors also argue that a teaching hospital
and its affiliated university are a delicate ecosystem whose
production of critical research is at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The grand institutions in Boston that are venerated are
characterized by a wildflower approach to invention and the
generation of new knowledge,'' said Dr. James Reinertsen, the chief
executive of Caregroup, which owns Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
Center. ``We don't run our institutions like agribusiness, a
massively efficient operation where we direct research and harvest
it. It's unplanned to a great extent, and that chaotic fermenting
environment is part of what makes the academic health centers what
they are.''

CIGNA HEALTHCARE TO DROP MEDICARE HMO PLANS IN KC, FIVE OTHER
AREAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIUS A. KARASH  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Cigna HealthCare will drop its Medicare HMO
plans in the Kansas City area and five other markets at the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The move will affect about 1,500 Kansas City area plan members,
Cigna said. The move will not affect members of other Cigna health
plans.
</P>
<P>
   The other affected markets are Cleveland, San Diego,
Philadelphia, south New Jersey and Little Rock, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Cigna said it decided to leave the six Medicare HMO markets
after reviewing government regulations on HMOs, reimbursement
rates, medical costs and other factors.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it would continue to cover health-care services
for affected members through Dec. 31. It said it would work with
affected members to ensure a smooth transition to alternative
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Many managed-care companies have dropped Medicare HMOs in the
past year or so. The companies have complained that government
reimbursement is too low in some areas.
</P>
<P>
   Other managed-care companies have gotten into Medicare coverage.
But the flux has called into question the federal government's
efforts to lower Medicare costs through the participation of
cost-conscious HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   With its departure next year, Cigna will not be among the HMOs
participating in a federal pilot project in the Kansas City area to
determine the feasibility of having HMOs bid competitively for
Medicare business. HMOs are now paid a fixed amount in each market,
determined by Medicare.

 BOSTON: they are.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal financing for research is plentiful of late, hospital
heads acknowledge. But they point out that the government expects
hospitals to subsidize 10 or 15 percent of that research, and they
must also provide important support for researchers still too
junior to win grants.
</P>
<P>
   A similar argument for slack in the system comes with teaching.
Teaching hospitals are pressing their faculties to take on greater
loads of patients to bring in more money, said Dr. Daniel D.
Federman, dean for medical education of Harvard Medical School. A
doctor under pressure to spend time in a billable way, Federman
said, has less time to spend teaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good teaching stops to ask the question `Why? _ Why is this
patient anemic?' _ and explore the science,'' Federman said. ``That
gets squeezed now.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't ask `Why?,' nothing moves forward,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston teaching hospitals generally deny that the money
squeeze is affecting patients' quality of care, students' quality
of education or research. But they say that if the current losses
swell as expected, deterioration in all three will inevitably
follow.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston hospitals' plight may be partly their fault for
competing so hard with each other, driving down prices, some
analysts say. Though some hospitals have merged in recent years,
Boston is still seen as having an oversupply of beds, and virtually
all hospitals are teaching hospitals here.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the causes, said Stuart Altman, professor of national
health policy at Brandeis University and past chairman for 12 years
of the committee that advised the government on Medicare prices,
``the concern is very real.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happened to them is that all of the cards have fallen
the wrong way at the same time,'' Altman said. ``I believe their
screams of woe are legitimate.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Among the cards that fell wrong, begin with managed care.
Massachusetts has an unusually large quotient of patients in
managed-care plans. Managed-care companies, themselves strapped,
have gotten increasingly tough about how much they will pay.
</P>
<P>
   Boston had also gone through a spate of fat-trimming hospital
mergers, closings and cost cutting in recent years. Add to the
troubles some complaints that affect all hospitals: expenses to
prepare their computers for 2000, problems getting insurance
companies and the government to pay up, new efforts to defend
against charges of billing fraud.
</P>
<P>
   But the back-breaking straw, hospital chiefs say, came with
Medicare cuts, enacted under the 1997 balanced-budget law, that
will slash more each year through 2002. The Association of American
Medical Colleges estimates that by then the losses for teaching
hospitals could reach $14.7 billion, and major teaching hospitals
will lose something about $150 million each. Nearly 100 teaching
hospitals are expected to be running in the red by then, the
association said last month.
</P>
<P>
   For years, teaching hospitals have been more dependent than any
others on Medicare. Unlike some other payers, Medicare has
consistently compensated them for their special missions _
training, sicker patients, indigent care _ by paying them extra.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons yet to be determined, Altman and others say the
Medicare cuts seem to be taking an even greater toll on the
teaching hospitals than had been expected. Much has changed since
the 1996 numbers on which the cuts were based, hospital chiefs say;
and the cuts particularly singled out teaching hospitals, whose
profit margins used to look fat.
</P>
<P>
   Frightening the hospitals still further, President Clinton's
next budget proposes even more Medicare cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone sympathizes, though. Complaints from hospitals that
financial pinching hurts have become familiar refrains. Critics say
the Boston hospitals are whining for more money when the only real
fix is broad health-care reform.
</P>
<P>
   Some propose that the rational solution is to analyze which
aspects of the teaching hospitals' work society is willing to pay
for, and then abandon the Byzantine old Medicare cross-subsidies
and pay for them straight out, perhaps through a new tax.
</P>
<P>
   Others question the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever hospitals face cuts, said Alan Sager of Boston
University, ``they claim it will be teaching and research and free
care of the uninsured that are cut first.''
</P>
<P>
   If the hospitals want more money, Sager argued, they should
allow independent auditors to check their books rather than asking
Congress to rely on a ``scream test.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For many doctors at the teaching hospitals, the screaming is
preventive medicine, meant to save their institutions from becoming
ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Medical care is an applied science, said Dr. Allan Ropper, chief
of neurology at St. Elizabeth's Hospital, and strong teaching
hospitals, with their cadres of doctors willing to spend
often-unreimbursed time on teaching and research, are essential to
helping move it forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no getting away from a patient and their illness,''
Ropper said, ``but if all you do is fix the watch, nobody ever
builds a better watch. It's a very subtle thing, but precisely
because it's so subtle, it's very easy to disrupt.''

POLLS SHOW MANDELA'S PARTY CLOSE TO ELECTION GOAL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ A flurry of recent polls show that
President Nelson Mandela's ruling African National Congress is
edging closer to the two-thirds majority it is seeking in South
Africa's second post-apartheid election scheduled for June 2.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, polls showed that support for the party had dipped to
as low as 51 percent in the face of the country's growing
unemployment and rising crime rates.
</P>
<P>
   But with only four weeks to go before the elections, several
polls show that the African National Congress _ which has been
energetically campaigning for the 66 percent majority that would
give it the power to make changes to the constitution _ may well
reach its goal.
</P>
<P>
   One poll, released Wednesday by the Institute for Democracy,
said the party had the support of 59 percent of the electorate. But
if voting turn out was low, researchers for the Institute, said
that the ANC's overall share of the vote could be as high as 67
percent.
</P>
<P>
   A survey by another non-profit research group, the Human
Sciences Research Council, showed that support for the party had
risen in March to 62 percent, up from 57 in December. Again,
researchers said a low turn out would help them over the line.
</P>
<P>
   The South African election season has been slow to take hold in
part because there has been little question about who the winner
will be. The ANC has tried to make its goal of a two-thirds
majority a rallying cry for its supporters.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a goal that has raised concerns among its critics,
many of whom are wary of what will happen to this fledgling
democracy if one party should have such power.
</P>
<P>
   The African National Congress, which won 63 percent of the vote
in 1994, has fueled this concern by being vague about what it wants
to do with a two-thirds majority. Some officials have seemed to
suggest that they would remove or reconstruct some of the watchdog
agencies that are for the time being very independent of the
government.
</P>
<P>
   There also has been talk that the African National Congress
wants to have more power over the country's 11 provincial
governments, which have had trouble delivering services and running
efficient administrations.
</P>
<P>
   But even Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, who is expected to become
the country's next president, seems unwilling to explain why the
African National Congress chose to focus on this goal. During a
television interview on April 18, he brushed aside the question,
saying that all political parties sought ``overwhelming''
majorities.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, however, South Africa seems to be involved in two
secondary political contests: Whether the ANC can get its
overwhelming majority and which party will emerge as the leader
among the pack of opposition parties fighting over the crumbs. The
new surveys seemed to show the crumbs are getting smaller.
</P>
<P>
   The New National Party, which used to run the country under
apartheid appears to still have the edge in the opposition race,
with about 8 percent of the vote according to the IDASA poll.
However, that is a long way from the 20 percent it got in 1994. The
liberal Democratic Party, which never supported apartheid, is close
at 6 percent, up from 2 percent in the last elections. The
Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party looks to have 4 percent of the
vote, down from 8.
</P>
<P>
   The newly formed United Democratic Party, which is trying to
offer itself as a multiracial alternative and appeared to surge in
popularity earlier this year, only has about 2 percent of the vote
at the moment, according to IDASA.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say that the African National Congress' recent gains
come largely from the voters who used to say that they were
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that as of mid-march 1999, South Africa's
opposition parties have failed to take advantage of the weaknesses
in ANC support and the large number of undecided voters that our
first survey uncovered,'' the researchers said in their analysis.
</P>
<P>
   There are, however, still a large number of undecideds _ 17
percent, according to the IDASA poll.

AFTER KILLER STORM, SURPRISE FOR MANY IN TOWN IS THAT THEY
SURVIVED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK MONTGOMERY  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOORE, Okla. _ Scores of families used to live here, in brick
houses and duplexes under shade trees, with pictures on the walls
and food in the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   All that remains of Shirley Phillips' home is the frame of the
bedroom closet that shielded her family from the twister. The wide,
black funnel plowed across Interstate 35 on Monday and ate
everything up and down Phillips' block in about a minute.
</P>
<P>
   They lived here, more than 300 strong, in a subdivision called
Moore Highland, a few miles south of Oklahoma City. Many of them
wondered aloud how they escaped dying here.
</P>
<P>
   At the police barricade on Northeast 27th Street and Highland
Avenue, families embraced and pleaded with authorities to let them
through so they might retrieve some photos or prescription medicine
or a pet. One teen-age boy who was allowed in came back two hours
later bouncing a basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all I could find from our house,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips lived around the corner from that boy. How she managed
to stay alive Monday night, along with her 6-year-old daughter, a
3-year-old grand-daughter and a sister-in-law _ all huddled in that
closet behind the bifold doors _ she could not explain. In fact,
only three bodies had been pulled from the devastation in Moore
Highland as of late Tuesday, a police official said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the hundreds who stumbled out of the debris Monday,
caked in the dust of fiberglass insulation, credited their closets
or their bathtubs; this was a modest 1960s-style development where
basements were rare.
</P>
<P>
   About 7 p.m. Monday, as civil defense sirens wailed and TVs
flashed warnings of what was bearing down on Moore, a city of
40,000, the Phillips family sat down in the closet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must have sung `Precious Memories' to my babies four or five
times to keep them calm,'' Shirley Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right before it hit, everything got real quiet and dark, and
then came this huge roar and the bedroom windows shattered and I
looked up and saw this swirling in the bedroom.''
</P>
<P>
   The roof had been ripped off, and there in the swirling was all
that Phillips owned _ bedding, clothing, groceries and a painting
that hung in the dining room. Only her pool table stayed put, and
the purse she left on top of it didn't budge.
</P>
<P>
   A block away, Trina Shannon trembled in a bathtub beneath a
mattress with her infant daughter. As the tornado passed, it wanted
to yank the whole bathroom floor skyward. Shannon felt the tub
rattle and the wall behind her head bulge.
</P>
<P>
   The bathroom stood. The rest of her duplex crumbled. ``I had
seen that tornado jump across I-35 so big, so black, so wide,''
Shannon said. Authorities think it was a half-mile wide at its
base, large enough to swallow the subdivision in one gulp.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon's husband, Lincoln, was racing home from work on the
interstate when it happened. By the time he reached the exit ramp
leading to the neighborhood, police had blocked it off. All he
could see from his driver's side window was the First Baptist
Church, the Texaco station on the corner and acres of rubble where
the homes stood.
</P>
<P>
   He drove a mile past other parked cars and emergency vehicles
before finding a place to pull over. He ran at top speed to reach
Moore Highland, and he found his wife standing in the ruin amid a
web of power lines strewn like cobwebs. She was clutching their
baby daughter. Both were OK.
</P>
<P>
   The Shannons returned Tuesday and found their baby stroller, a
pair of sneakers and a few sweaters in the remains of their home.
Pushing the stroller back to their car, Trina Shannon said, ``Well,
we've got to start over.'' She said they were not insured.
</P>
<P>
   They're spending the week at a hotel. Dozens of their neighbors
have found shelter in the First Baptist Church, where the Red Cross
tacked up computer printouts listing more than 200 ``found people''
and a few ``lost people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People are coming in and saying they can't find a mother,
can't find a grandmother, but so far we've been able to help locate
many more people than not,'' said volunteer Carla Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Angie Thompson, a youth worker for an ecumenical group called
Faith Believers, spent Monday night and most of Tuesday with
families now homeless in Moore.
</P>
<P>
   ``A little blond boy told me he knew God was with him because he
was praying to God when the storm hit,'' Thompson said. ``As for
the doubters, I tell them I don't have any answers.''
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday afternoon, First Baptist was taking in truckloads of
items donated from across Oklahoma: boxes of canned peaches and
peanut butter, toys, paper towels, lawn furniture, diapers, soda
pop and saltines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we have enough? We can't have enough for this disaster,'' a
Cleveland County relief worker said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the church, a chunk of wood the size of a baseball bat
had somehow lodged into the concrete cross that towers above 27th
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Vans and mattresses were tossed 200 feet over chain-link fences
and into the interstate overpass. Utility poles were shaved off at
their bases. At a restaurant and bar up the street, adults throwing
a birthday party Monday night could only crouch and stare out the
window as the twister rolled in from the southwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drink up. The liquor's free,'' a bartender nervously joked as
the funnel passed a mile to the south, barely missing the Moore
water tower.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south and west, at West Moore High School, the tornado
had thrown 150 cars in the parking lot and at least one horse out
of the way. Some 300 students and their parents were attending an
awards ceremony inside the auditorium when the warning sirens
sounded.
</P>
<P>
   They took cover in the hallways, and though the storm heavily
damaged the school, nobody inside died and only a few suffered
``superficial injuries,'' said City Councilman Jerry Foshee. ``Just
the corridors kept them out of harm's way.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaylon Core of West Moore jumped into his pickup with his son,
daughter and dog as the twister neared. ``We just boogied out of
there as fast as we could,'' he said, but the tornado seemed intent
on trailing them.
</P>
<P>
   As Core sped east on 27th Street, he glanced out his
passenger-side window and saw the funnel passing him. By the time
he reached his girlfriend's home in Del City about 10 miles away,
the tornado had already damaged 600 homes there, leveling many.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're trying to get out of the path of disaster, you
realize that your kids, your dog and your truck is about all in
life that you need,'' Core said.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the Moore Highland subdivision realized Tuesday that
for all they had lost, they somehow hung onto their lives. They
thanked the early warnings, which gave them a good hour to prepare,
and they praised their little closets, corridors and bathtubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking at all that mess, I feel very lucky,'' said Shirley
Phillips as she clutched the hand of her daughter, Tori. ``How
about you, Tori? Do you feel lucky, honey?''
</P>
<P>
   The little girl just gazed at the vista of ruin where she and
her friends used to skip rope. She had nothing to say.

TAIWAN'S OPPOSITION PARTY TONES DOWN CALL FOR INDEPENDENCE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Reaching for the political center as it prepares for a
presidential election, Taiwan's main opposition party is softening
its call for formal independence from China, once its defining
trait.
</P>
<P>
   The popular former mayor of Taipei, Chen Shui-bian, is the
party's likely candidate in the election next March, which will be
only the second direct election for president here. But to have any
chance of winning, his Democratic Progressive Party needs to
reassure voters that it will not provoke a dangerous confrontation
with China, which considers Taiwan an errant province.
</P>
<P>
   At a party congress this weekend, a new statement will be added
to the party's charter. It is intended to signal that, if elected
to national power, the Democratic Progressives would not take
precipitous action _ like calling a plebiscite on the island's
status or officially adopting ``Republic of Taiwan'' as a national
name _ that could shake the prosperity and de facto independence
which Taiwan now enjoys. A draft of the new statement was adopted
by a committee Wednesday for final approval on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sign that independence sentiment remains deep among
many core supporters, the charter will not be overhauled as
sweepingly as Chen and others had wanted.
</P>
<P>
   The draft statement says the status quo is acceptable only
because Taiwan is in effect already sovereign, and it pointedly
rejects the concept of ``one China'' so cherished by the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should give Chen Shui-bian what he needs to show that the
party is not to be feared,'' said Fu-Hsiung Shen, a legislator and
a close ally of Chen, in a telephone interview. ``But any deeper
change would create another hazard: people would say the party sold
its soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeking overt independence was the founding goal of the
Democratic Progressive Party when it emerged in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the Nationalist Party _ founded by Chiang Kai-shek,
who was driven from the mainland in 1949 by the Communists _ has
consistently maintained in principle that it seeks reunification
with China, though in practice, Taiwan has aggressively sought an
independent identity.
</P>
<P>
   In speeches, Chen and other Democratic Progressive leaders have
begun to backtrack on the independence issue, and the positions of
the two major parties have been converging. But largely because of
personal rivalries, it now appears that the election could be a
melee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taiwanese politics in coming years may be in for an
upheaval,'' said Chu Yun-han, a political scientist at National
Taiwan University.
</P>
<P>
   Chen, after losing his mayor's seat in a suspenseful election in
December, remains popular around the island and is seen as a
domestic reformer. But his party may be weakened by the defection
of its former chairman, Hsu Hsin-liang, who has long had his heart
set on running for president. Hsu has said he intends to run on his
own ticket.
</P>
<P>
   With Popular Nationalist President Lee Teng-hui, who must step
down next year after his four-year term, the Nationalist Party
still has the broadest public support and the strongest
organization, but it may suffer a more catastrophic split. The
likely candidate for president will be Vice President Lien Chan,
but another Nationalist powerhouse and a rival of Lee, James Soong,
has indicated that he may bolt and run on his own, too. And in
opinion polls, Soong has greater support than either Chen or Lian.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Nationalist Party is united, then I think it can crush
Chen Shui-bian,'' said Chu, the political scientist. ``But if James
Soong enters and there is a three-way race, then Chen Shui-bian
will have a fighting chance.''

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Few issues have generated more bipartisan support
this year or moved faster down the legislative track than the drive
to increase pay and pensions for the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration proposed a plan in January with a
price tag of $36 billion over the next decade. The Senate passed a
10-year, $62 billion package by a vote of 91 to 8 in February. On
Thursday, the House will take up a measure to provide $1.8 billion
for the first year _ all of it on an emergency basis, which would
allow the appropriation to dodge the tight limits that budget rules
impose on most spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is strong, overwhelming bipartisan support in the
Congress this year to make some changes in pay, in retirement, in
enlistment and re-enlistment bonuses,'' President Clinton told
troops on his visit to Ramstein Air Base in Germany on Wednesday.
``And those things, plus some other things we're going to do, I
hope will help to keep more of you in the service and I hope will
help to get more young people coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all the political appeal _ especially in the midst of a
military conflict _ of giving a raise to the men and women who put
their lives on the line for the country, a wide array of government
and private analysts question whether the billions of dollars will
solve the main problem the money is intended to address: the exodus
of skilled personnel in midcareer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recruitment and retention is a real problem that needs to be
addressed,'' said Steven Kosiak, an analyst at the Center for
Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a research group. ``But it's a
classic situation where you shouldn't just throw money at a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   As one of the costliest measures being considered by Congress
this year, a raise could also test the commitment of both parties
to keep spending in check.
</P>
<P>
   Fiscal watchdog groups are particularly concerned about plans to
reverse a military pension cut imposed in 1986, a provision of both
the administration and Senate measures. Such a turnabout, they say,
would not only be extremely expensive for decades to come but also
send the wrong signal as Congress struggles to address the looming
insolvency of the Social Security and Medicare systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time when our nation is preparing for the fiscal
challenges of an aging population by debating the tough choices
involved in Social Security and Medicare reform, we can ill afford
to undo one of the few tough choices about long-term spending that
already have been made,'' said Robert Bixby, policy director of the
Concord Coalition, an organization that promotes budget discipline.
</P>
<P>
   A few members of Congress have questioned any need to rush
through a bill, saying the issue of keeping highly trained
personnel like pilots in the armed services is complicated and
involves factors other than pay and pensions, among them lengthy
deployments away from families and the quality of health care and
housing.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals ``are not silver bullets that will solve the
retention problem,'' said Rep. Steve Buyer, R-Ind., chairman of the
House Armed Services Subcommittee on Military Personnel. ``There is
a risk that once we spend the money to implement all those
proposals, we will still likely be confronted with lagging
retention that continues to degrade readiness.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, Pentagon officials have encountered
nothing but support from the administration and Congress for their
case that better pay and retirement plans are a crucial component
of their efforts to reverse a slide in recruiting and stem the
departure of the people the military most needs to keep.
</P>
<P>
   The latest backing came last week from the House Appropriations
Committee, which added $1.8 billion for military pay next year to
the bill for emergency spending on the conflict in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   As with the rest of the bill, which seeks a total of $12.9
billion in emergency spending for the Kosovo operation and a
variety of other military needs, the $1.8 billion for military pay
would fall outside the limits imposed by the government's usual
spending caps, but only if President Clinton certified that dealing
with the issue qualified as a national emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Senate, which has authorized a pay raise but not yet
appropriated money for it, will adopt a similar emergency approach
is unclear. In any case, Clinton has not said whether he would
designate military raises an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's proposal calls for a 4.4 percent military
pay increase next year, followed by raises in subsequent years
matching civilian compensation growth. It would provide bonuses of
up to 9.9 percent for selected midcareer personnel and improve the
pension plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate version would add to the raise, increasing pay by 4.8
percent next year and setting subsequent raises half a percentage
point above civilian wage growth. It would increased the size of
the midcareer bonuses to 10.3 percent, and further sweeten the
pension plan.
</P>
<P>
   As for the House, although it is about to vote on financing the
first year of a pay increase, it has yet to take up legislation
detailing how the money would be spent.
</P>
<P>
   The two parties have largely swept aside warnings from the
Congressional Budget Office and the General Accounting Office that
the pay gap between the civilian work force and the military may be
exaggerated and that increased retirement benefits are unlikely to
stem skilled personnel's departure from the service.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by the budget office found that the 1986 pension
cut _ to 40 percent of base pay after 20 years of service, from 50
percent _ had had no significant impact on early retirement
decisions. Reversing that cut, a move that would cost $14.3 billion
over the next decade, would therefore probably do little to help
retain midcareer personnel, the CBO concluded.

   WASHINGTON _ A 1994 agreement between a Boston banking activist
and Fleet Financial Group Inc. was highlighted on the Senate floor
Wednesday as a prominent lawmaker argued for changes to a federal
law that requires banks to loan money to low-income homebuyers and
inner-city businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Displaying large posters with language from the 1994 deal,
Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, argued that a federal law
called the Community Reinvestment Act had given a Boston organizer
undue clout in persuading Fleet to commit money to his group.
</P>
<P>
   Many details of the deal had not previously been made public,
and Gramm did not mention the activist, Bruce Marks, or Fleet by
name. But Marks Wednesday said that the contract Gramm displayed
was from his deal with Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   That deal has been the subject of wide attention in Boston. It
was signed after Marks and his Neighborhood Assistance Corp. of
America highlighted predatory lending practices by banks in several
Boston neighborhoods in which homeowners were persuaded to sign
second mortgages at very high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   By drawing attention to lending activities by a former Fleet
subsidiary, Marks was able to win a commitment from Fleet to make
$140 million available for loans to low-income and minority
borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   But Gramm Wednesday said that federal law had given community
groups the clout to ``blackmail'' banks by threatening to lodge
complaints with regulators unless they win loan commitments and
cash payments.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm is proposing changes to the Community Reinvestment Act
that he says would limit the power of community groups seeking
commitments from banks. Others say Gramm's changes would prompt
banks to reduce their lending in low-income neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   One of several contracts displayed by Gramm Wednesday showed
that an unnamed bank agreed to pay a community group 2.75 percent
of the value of loans made under a $140 million loan program. The
contract also showed that the bank would pay the group $200,000 to
cover start-up costs for administering the loan program.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the community group agreed to ``withdraw all
pending protests'' before regulators against the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm had removed the name of the bank and the community group,
but Marks said they were Fleet and the Neighborhood Assistance
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Marks said that payments by Fleet to his group cover the cost of
services provided to low-income borrowers. Marks's group finds
potential borrowers, offers credit counseling, and guides them
through the mortgage process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can take people two, three years to get ready to be able to
purchase a home,'' Marks said. ``Look at all the services we do,
then at the fees we get, and you'll see we don't get enough.''

 &HT;    Firefighters survive Six Flags' Scorcher
 &HT;    By Chris Reinolds
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A sudden blur of purple-and-gold twisted steel
accompanied by the suppressed cries of fellow riders. The sensation
of being pulled apart while airborne.
</P>
<P>
   This is amusement.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Scorcher, Six Flags Over Georgia's first stand-up
roller coaster, was christened Wednesday with more than 100
firefighters on the inaugural ride. Firefighters from 16
departments showed up for a free ride in full gear, jogging from
their trucks to the coaster.
</P>
<P>
   The Scorcher provides adrenaline junkies with a healthy dose of
fear and excitement. Riders straddle a bicyclelike seat while
standing with their knees slightly bent. A U-shaped harness bar
keeps riders from falling out. There is no enclosure, so those
brave souls in the outside seats have nothing between them and the
sky.
</P>
<P>
   Riders climb more than 10 stories before the first downhill run.
The top speed is 54 miles per hour. The cars fly up and over six
times on high-speed loops, spirals, a camel back, corkscrew and a
figure-eight. G-forces pull the tears out of your eyes.
</P>
<P>
   It's a smooth, 2 1/2-minute ride without the jerking and pulling
of some coasters. ``It's real exciting _ better than fighting
fires,'' Fulton County firefighter Antonio Hines said while trying
to catch his breath. ``The standing makes the difference, and
there's more turns and curves.''
</P>
<P>
   Marietta firefighter Dean Wilkinson said the ride was too short,
but compared it favorably with other coasters. ``It felt like I
lost my stomach more. You tense up a little more,'' he said as he
headed up the ramp a second time.
</P>
<P>
   Those were amateur opinions. Gary Slade, publisher of trade
magazine Amusement Today, gave a professional's description. ``It
has a lot of elements _ thrills, speed and action all packed into a
tight ground space. Because of that, the ride does not slow down or
lag. There's no time to catch your breath.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're standing up through the first vertical loop, it's
the first time you feel the G-forces coming down into your legs,''
Slade said. The track also is heavily banked sideways, which allows
riders to be parallel to the ground. ``There's the sensation that
you might teeter out or fall out. You don't get that kind of
sensation in a coaster car,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Designed and engineered by Bollinger &AMP; Mabillard of Switzerland,
the new $10 million coaster is the park's eighth. The park has
removed the Raging Rivers water ride, the least popular of the
water rides. ``People love to be thrilled and coasters are the No.
1 attraction at most theme parks,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The park opened the ride last weekend without fanfare, but the
official opening will be Saturday, said Six Flags spokeswoman
Terrie Ward. The park will open daily beginning Memorial Day
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   And about those firefighters: The thrill ride was followed by a
real training exercise, coordinated by the Georgia Mutual Aid
group.

SARA LEE TO BUILD SEITZ MEAT PROCESSING PLANT IN ST. JOSEPH, MO. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) _ Sara Lee Corp. said Wednesday that it would build an
$80 million Seitz meat processing plant in St. Joseph, Mo., adding
250 to 350 jobs to its operation there.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Lee, which currently employs 155 persons at its Seitz plant
in St. Joseph, expects the new facility to be completed by the
first quarter of 2000. The company hasn't decided what to do with
the existing Seitz facility.
</P>
<P>
   Construction of the 250,000-square-foot building will begin
immediately on 40 acres north of Mitchell Woods Business Park.
Financing for the new plant came through a combination of private-
and public-sector funding, said Patt Lilly, president and chief
executive officer of the St. Joseph Area Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the $80 million initial investment, Sara Lee
plans to spend $45 million over a six-year period to expand the
facility.
</P>
<P>
   Once completed, the new Seitz plant will have between 405 and
505 employees, with wages averaging $11 to $12 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new jobs, additional payroll, millions of dollars in new
construction and new tax revenue will have a positive effect on the
St. Joseph economy for many years to come,'' Lilly said.
</P>
<P>
   The new Seitz plant will process meats such as Hillshire Farm
Deli Select, Hillshire Farm smoked sausage, Seitz hot dogs and
luncheon meats, and Ball Park franks.
</P>
<P>
   Chamber officials said information regarding employment at Seitz
had not been determined.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Lee follows two companies that began expanding in St.
Joseph earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Aegis Communications Group Inc. of Dallas plans to open a
customer service center in St. Joseph, employing 300 persons.
Phoenix Scientific Inc. also is expanding its St. Joseph facility
and could add 200 jobs over the next five years.

 &HT;    TRAGIC APACHE CRASH SPOTLIGHTS DEMANDING COMMANDER OF TASK FORCE
HAWK
 &HT;    700&AMP;ADDS
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-CLINTON-0506.

<P>
   RINAS AIR BASE, Albania _ When Army Lt. Gen. John W. Hendrix got
a phone call on March 26, he knew he was getting a rough
assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Two of his bosses in the military chain of command were on the
secure line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want you to put together a force that is built around some
Apaches,'' as Hendrix recalls it. ``And take it over (to the
Balkans).''
</P>
<P>
   Hendrix, who has kept a very low profile in media coverage of
the U.S. military build-up in Albania, told this story to visiting
U.S. congressman last week. A partial transcript of his briefing
was released on Wednesday, hours after one of the Apache attack
helicopters under his command here in ``Task Force Hawk'' crashed
in a training exercise over Albania killing both men on board.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of the most challenging days in the fast-track
military career of the 57-year-old general from Statesville, Ga. A
tank commander, he was the demanding boss of the 3rd Infantry
Division (Mechanized) at Fort Stewart, Ga. from 1996 to 1997,
following a stint as a commander at Fort Benning.
</P>
<P>
   About a quarter of a century earlier, when he was a green
officer not long out of Atlanta's Georgia Tech, he fought in the
Vietnam War with the Screaming Eagles of the 101st Airborne
Division.
</P>
<P>
   So Hendrix didn't get three big black stars on his helmet by
saying no to challenges.
</P>
<P>
   But until Wednesday at 1:30 a.m. (local time), he didn't know
how rough and heart-wrenching his new job would turn out to be.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Hendrix got word that the second of his 24 Apache
helicopters had crashed within 10 days on a midnight training
mission near the border with Kosovo. A third Apache was knocked out
of commission, at least temporarily, by a hard landing in northern
Italy even before the first of the helicopters arrived at this
likely staging area for a NATO strike force against Serb forces in
Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
   ``On behalf of Lt. Gen. Hendrix and the soldiers of Task Force
Hawk, I would like to express our deepest sympathy and sincerest
condolences to the families and loved ones of the pilots,''
Hendrix's spokesman told journalists waiting at the gate to the
airfield.
</P>
<P>
   The Apaches were supposed to be ``the tip of the spear in the
entire United States military.'' That is the memorable phrase of
Hendrix's young Apache pilots, Capt. Mark Arden, 29, of Washington,
D.C., said when the first Apaches arrived on April 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risks to the Serbian Forces I would say are great,'' Arden
said. ``They have been successful so far against women and children
that are unarmed . . . the table is about to turn when we enter the
conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Apaches will finally go into combat is now unclear. On
Wednesday, Hendrix's spokesman insisted that the second Apache
crash would not delay the ``timeline'' for the first mission. But
then there came word from the Pentagon that there really isn't much
need right away to send in the Apaches.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton will have to dispatch his ``execute''
order to the NATO commander, U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark. And then
Clark will tell Hendrix to launch the first Apache mission when he
is ready.
</P>
<P>
   Although Apaches were designed to team up with advancing tank
columns, going in low and hard to sweep away enemy armored units to
allow ground troops to surge forward behind them, military
officials never indicated any plans to put them in Kosovo with any
ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   That strategy, in line with the repeated U.S. policy of not
using ground troops in Kosovo, suggests that the remaining 22
Apaches would be used to blast Serb forces with the most lethal
anti-armored weapon in the American arsenal without risking the
inevitable casualties of ground warfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``This particular mission is interesting and difficult,''
Hendrix said to the congressman last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Hendrix's first Apache crashed on April 26, reportedly when it
hit an air pocket descending over a ridge, forcing the chopper to
clip its rotor blade on an obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   That first crash, the pilots got lucky and so did Hendrix,
saying that ``aggressive'' night training missions with live
ordinance on board were necessary to make his Apache crews ready
for war.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, by Wednesday, Task Force Hawk had shaken off the
embarrassment. Enough so, that the rigorous training was back on
track.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   In the dead of the night, over rugged mountainous terrain of
northern Albania, Hendrix's Apaches were on a low-flying rehearsal
mission. It may well have been their last rehearsal before striking
into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Army spokesman Lt. Col. Garrie Dornan said the second crashed
Apache was carrying a full combat load of munitions -- eight
Hellfire laser-guided anti-tank missiles and 38 rockets hanging
under the fuselage.
</P>
<P>
   These pilots weren't lucky -- nor was their commander.
</P>
<P>
   Other troops taking part in the exercise saw the second Apache
fireball in 10 days. And now some hotshot young Apache pilot and
his weapons officer lay either dead or dying in a maelstrom of
flames and bursting ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   The Apache's Hellfire missiles and its rockets are built with
``insensitive'' high explosives that aren't supposed to detonate by
accident. But this time they did.
</P>
<P>
   The Army Medivac copter got here fast, in only 15 minutes from
this air field 45 miles to the southwest of the crash scene. But
because of flames and exploding ordinance, the Medivac crew
couldn't rush in and pull out the bodies. For at least two hours,
according to the Army's sketchy statements, the risk of blowing up
a team of combat medics was judged to be over the limits for
safety.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Hendrix, who has the reputation as an extremely demanding boss,
believes that wars are won by training.
</P>
<P>
   He inherited the Apaches of the 11th Aviation Regiment last year
when he was handed one of the Army's prime assignments: commanding
the Army's V Corps in Germany, which includes two divisions of
heavy M1A1 battle tanks. The Apaches were one of the units that
came with his headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 18 months, while he commanded V Corps, Hendrix has
pushed his Apache pilots through six major Combined Air Operations
exercises and one battle command exercise called a BCTP, or battle
command training program. Then when he got the assignment to bring
his Apaches to the Balkans, he immediately ordered them back to a
firing range for more gunnery training.
</P>
<P>
   Hendrix also found Brig. Gen. Richard Cody, the Army's top
expert on Apache tactics, at an assignment in the United States.
Cody was flown into Hendrix's headquarters at V Corps and became
his right-hand man for the Apaches.

FOREIGN INVESTORS HOPE TO RECOUP LOSSES FROM RUSSIA'S DEBT PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By NEELA BANERJEE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ When Russia defaulted on $40 billion in debt last
August, most foreigners who had once been lured by the high
interest rates on Russian government bonds figured they would be
lucky to get anything out of their investments.
</P>
<P>
   By late last week, nearly all of them had agreed to the
stringent terms of the Russian government's debt restructuring
plan. The trouble is, no one really knows what they have exactly
agreed to and how much, if anything, the government's plan will
give them in the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Foreigners agreed without truly knowing the reality of what
they were entering into, what it's going to bring them,'' said
Sergei Prudnik, an economist with Troika Dialog, a Moscow brokerage
firm. ``Their feeling was that it's better to get something than
nothing at all. And the government's idea was, `Let's do something
now and work out the details later.'''
</P>
<P>
   The broad terms of the restructuring plan are clear. In return
for the nearly $17 billion in ruble-denominated Treasury securities
they held at the time of the default, foreigners will get about 10
percent of their investments in what the Russians are calling
``cash.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the only cash investors might receive would come from
using some ruble proceeds from the Treasury bills to buy a limited
amount of dollars at special currency auctions. After that,
foreigners can transfer these dollars abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty percent of the restructuring package comes in the form of
tax write-offs, which most foreigners do not need but can sell to
Russian investors. But the bulk of their investments will be
swapped for new government securities that mature over four to five
years.
</P>
<P>
   All proceeds from trading in these new securities will be in
rubles, and foreigners will not be able to convert those rubles to
dollars and repatriate them for an unspecified period.
</P>
<P>
   After much pressure from foreign investors, the government
agreed to let nonresidents use those rubles to buy stocks and bonds
at leading Russian companies.
</P>
<P>
   Nine months after the default and a week after the restructuring
offer deadline passed, the government has yet to disclose an
official, complete list of the Russian companies involved and the
mechanism by which foreigners may invest in them. Some information
has come out, however haphazardly, and investors and their brokers
are now trying to decide, based on an incomplete picture, where to
put all the rubles they are expecting to get.
</P>
<P>
   Opinions vary wildly about which investments would be the safest
and most fruitful, primarily because of Russia's own inherent
instability. The annualized interest rates paid by the new Russian
government securities exceed 100 percent, but that may not be
enough to offset a steep devaluation of the ruble or rise in
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was so scared last fall about hyperinflation that
there's still this hangover fear,'' said Peter Boone, head of
research at Moscow's Brunswick Warburg investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   The corporate bonds that foreigners can purchase under the debt
restructuring would offer far lower interest rates, starting at
about 6 percent. But they would be redeemed, in part or in full, in
dollars. So far, Gazprom, &UR;  &LR; Russia's gas monopoly, and Lukoil, &UR;  &LR; the
country's largest oil company, have submitted prospectuses for bond
issues. Both earn much of their revenue in hard currency.
</P>
<P>
   For the Russian companies, the bond issues would be a way of
essentially getting enormous loans on which they would pay
relatively low interest. But here, too, there's risk involved for
investors: the companies could default if their revenue fell
sharply or if the government confiscated their hard-currency
earnings, as it has in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Many believe Russian equities would be a good investment. The
government has said that foreign investors in the debt
restructuring plan can use their rubles to buy shares of Russian
blue-chip companies like Lukoil, metals giant Norilsk Nickel,
long-distance provider Rostelekom and utilities Unified Energy
Systems, Mosenergo and Irkutskenergo. The list is expected to be
expanded.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipation that foreign investors would be putting more money
into the Russian stock market was one reason why it surged 12.1
percent Wednesday to its highest level since the August default.
Optimism generated by the International Monetary Fund's
announcement last week that it would restructure $4.5 billion in
Russian debt also contributed to the rally.
</P>
<P>
   But overall, Russian shares, which are priced in dollars, are
still undervalued, analysts say. The hope is that by buying them
now, investors can reap a windfall when the share prices rise. That
is assuming, of course, that Russia pulls out of its latest
economic mire. &QL;

OKLAHOMANS HAVE BEEN THERE BEFORE

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEL CITY, Okla. _ First there was the tornado of '58, which blew
past Yvonne Rose's house in Shawnee and set it ablaze. Then there
was the twister of '59, which ripped apart her roof, followed by
the one in '75 that yanked her fences out of the ground.
</P>
<P>
   But this was different. It wasn't just the force of the tornado
that leveled the Rose family house Monday night, destroying decades
of memories. It was the timing: On the heels of so many disasters
around the world _ especially the Oklahoma City bombing _ the
devastation of her 600-home neighborhood seemed to Rose, 63, to
mean something more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the end is a lot closer than people think,'' she said,
sitting in a living room chair on her front lawn to survey a sea of
splintered wood that stretched as far as the horizon. ``You can see
it every day. People just aren't putting it in context.''
</P>
<P>
   Her interpretation was among the most dire in Del Aire Addition,
a close-knit suburban enclave that suffered almost complete
destruction and at least two deaths Monday night. And yet everyone
spoke in extremes. At the very least, they all said, the tornado
ruined a hard-built way of life in this community of military
servicemen and government workers, nearly all of whom had lived
here more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahomans have grown accustomed to cataclysmic events in recent
times, and have even developed a certain pride at their ability to
rally together when disaster hits. Red Cross workers know how to
mobilize, as they did after the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P.
Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City. Church groups
are in close contact across the state, ready to ship food at the
first sign of natural disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Even residents know the drill. ``I think Oklahomans are very
resilient folks,'' said Kari Ferguson, executive director of the
Oklahoma City National Memorial, soon to be unveiled at the site of
the bombing. ``I heard one survivor of the bombing say that people
don't see beauty in the state, but the beauty is in the people. And
I think that's right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Being an Oklahoman is about hanging in there and doing what
you have to do for each other,'' agreed Lynda Mobley, 41, a
resident of Del Aire Addition. ``We've got it in our blood.''
</P>
<P>
   That much was clear Wednesday in Mobley's neighborhood, where
hundreds of residents and their relatives picked through rubble,
pausing often to shake hands with friends and take strolls along
the winding lanes to see if others needed help.
</P>
<P>
   Most had come to the neighborhood in the 1960s to escape urban
crime and to be close to Tinker Air Force Base next door, risking
the annual tornado season in Oklahoma for a quiet suburban way of
life. It was, at the time, ``where everyone wanted to live,'' said
Linda Haynes, 58, a resident of 34 years.
</P>
<P>
   Over the decades, families raised children in the development's
cul-de-sacs, built a swimming pool, and formed one of the strongest
neighborhood associations in Oklahoma. Few ever moved out.
</P>
<P>
   But now, for the first time, many are wondering whether that
will change. Of the 600 homes, some 450 are all but gone. Those
that still have their foundations intact are heavily damaged. What
was once a cookie-cutter layout of backyards and driveways has been
transformed into a giant junkyard, with cars lying in twisted piles
of metal and housing insulation scattered everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   In the front yard of one resident lay a perfectly preserved
white ceramic bathtub, directly in front of a house that was
otherwise demolished. The resident, Don Northern, took refuge in
the tub during the storm. When the tornado blew through his house,
the tub was catapulted outside, knocking the elderly man
unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street, neighbors played off the humor of stray
objects with a dark joke, planting a sign _ ``Garage Sale'' _ in
front of 3388 Del Aire Place, a residence that was virtually gone.
In front of another pile of rubble, resident Tex Irwin, 69, placed
a ``For Sale'' sign pointing in the direction of what was once his
home of 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said we might as well,'' Irwin said with a grim smile.
``It's not like we can live here anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how many of the thousands left homeless by Monday's
storms will be able to return home. Eleven counties in Oklahoma and
Kansas had been declared disaster areas the day before, qualifying
them for immediate emergency aid. But the long process of securing
insurance funds was only beginning Wednesday, two days after the
deadliest tornado storm to hit Oklahoma in 52 years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the medical costs of the 700 or so in the state
who were injured, the property damage from the storm could cost as
much as $250 million in Oklahoma alone, where more than 1,500 homes
were hit, state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But if the costs of rebuilding were not yet clear, the emotional
toll was becoming so by late Wednesday, especially as residents
stopped to consider what this latest wave of devastation meant for
Oklahoma City as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Some shrugged off the connection between the bombing and the
tornado, chalking it up to an odd string of bad luck that must now,
for sure, be at an end. Others said they were considering moving
elsewhere, though they had nowhere else to go.
</P>
<P>
   At least one resident, Danny Speaks, laughed about the string of
horrifying events as part of Oklahoma City's charm.
</P>
<P>
   ``A pretty place to live, isn't it?'' said Speaks, 41.
</P>
<P>
   Yvonne Rose, for her part, is leaving town. She raised five
children and four grandchildren in that house. She had seen one too
many tornadoes, and heard repercussions from the Oklahoma City
bombing from her own backyard. The time had come to move to
Tennessee or North Carolina, somewhere with relatives, even though
she said she believed the worldwide apocalypse was on its way.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Allen, a minister of the Christ Life Church of God,
expressed a similar view as he brought food and water to the
neighborhood. The tornadoes were a ``sign of the times,'' as the
Earth ``belched with problems'' and headed into its final years, he
said, citing both the Murrah building bombing and the shooting last
month at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., as examples.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oklahoma, for whatever reason, has been plagued recently,''
Allen, 34, said. ``I'm not going to blame it on evil spirits or
anything. I think it's just the way the world is turning now. But
fortunately, here in Oklahoma, we're in the Bible Belt. We know how
to help each other out.''

HOME-BASED WORKERS NOW HAVE A DAY OF THEIR OWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) _ Today is the first Missouri Work at Home Day. You
probably haven't heard of it.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Southwestern Bell _ which not so coincidentally
sells telephone services that home-based offices might use _ just
created the day, getting the blessings of state, city, chamber and
economic development officials.
</P>
<P>
   Contrived or not, there's justification for recognizing the
growing force of at-home workers.
</P>
<P>
   According to the most recent numbers available from the U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1.79 million of the 129.6 million
members of the American work force spend 35 or more hours a week
working at home, making home-based work their principal job and
source of income.
</P>
<P>
   That may sound like a minuscule market, but it's only part of
the at-home picture. According to the same 1997 numbers, there are
4.125 million home-based businesses in the United States. For about
2.3 million of them, the home business is a second job.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers get much bigger when you count all the Americans who
conduct some kind of income-related work in their homes. The bureau
counts more than 21 million workers in that category.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of those working at home report that they're
``traditional'' employees, drawing a wage or salary from an
employer. More than half of them, though, say they're not expressly
paid for their work done at home.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, there are lots of teachers, sales agents,
lawyers _ anyone, really _ who take work home at night.
</P>
<P>
   Less than one in five of the work-at-home crew actually gets
paid for work at home.
</P>
<P>
   However the numbers are analyzed, though, it's apparent that
Southwestern Bell knows its market potential. The company has
created a Work at Home Resources staff to provide
telecommunications support for home offices.
</P>
<P>
   Homebuilders; furniture manufacturers; security system
providers; computer companies; software designers; purveyors of
telephones, answering machines, fax machines and all manner of
office equipment; and service providers are responding to home
office needs.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Internal Revenue Service got into the act, making it
easier this year for home-based workers to qualify for the income
tax deduction for business use of the home.
</P>
<P>
   The new tax rule still requires the ``exclusive'' and
``regular'' use test: You must use your home office only for
business, not for any personal reasons (such as letting the kids
play games on the computer), and the home office must be used on a
continuing basis, not occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   But the new rule makes it a bit easier for some home-based
workers to meet the qualification. If the home office is used
exclusively and regularly for the administration and management of
the business _ and there is no other fixed location where the
taxpayer conducts those activities _ then the home office may meet
the deduction.
</P>
<P>
   That allows for, possibly, a home repair contractor, who has no
other office location but does all his scheduling and other
business management activities out of a home office, to qualify if
he meets all other conditions. In the past, because most of the
contractor's time was spent outside his home office _ in the homes
he was repairing _ he could not have qualified for the deduction.
</P>
<P>
   Home-based business operators say their growing numbers may be
what it takes to eliminate other impediments to their operations.
That means getting more than just high-speed access lines for their
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Local zoning laws often prohibit home-based businesses.
Temporary staffing agencies sometimes refuse to send workers to
home-based operations. Some package-delivery services charge more
for pickups and deliveries at homes than at office sites.
</P>
<P>
   Home-based workers interested in keeping up with trends and
issues may want to check out www.gohome.com, a Web page created by
Business &LR; Home, which publishes a national magazine.

CONFERENCE REFLECTS WOES OF ARAB NATIONS' HUMAN RIGHTS ADVOCATES 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JOHN F. BURNS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CASABLANCA, Morocco _ When human rights activists from 15 Arab
nations met here recently for the first conference of its kind in
the Arab world, organizers were reminded of the suspicion with
which many Arab governments view efforts to widen individual
liberties.
</P>
<P>
   During the three-day meeting, an intruder was discovered
searching through wastepaper baskets, recovering handwritten notes
discarded by delegates. Several attempts were made to gain passes
to the conference by men posing as reporters or students, but who
turned out to be neither. In the photocopying room, another
intruder fled when he was discovered copying conference documents.
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion reached by the Egyptian activist who was the
conference's principal convener, Bahey El-Din Hassan, was that the
intruders were agents sent from outside Morocco by some of the Arab
world's most repressive governments. Hassan, director of the Cairo
Institute for Human Rights Studies, a private group that has
frequently clashed with Egyptian authorities, had worked for
several years to prepare for the conference, and knew the meeting
would be seen as a threat by many Arab governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some delegates who canceled in the last month because
of concerns for their safety,'' Hassan said in late April. ``It is
understandable, but it is a shame, because the purpose of our
meeting here was to foster a sense of solidarity among human rights
defenders throughout the Arab world, who face the same pattern of
repression, the same official discourse against human rights and
democracy, and the same pattern of abuse of human rights
principles.''
</P>
<P>
   According to conference officials, more than 50 Arab human
rights groups are active in Arab nations, many of them established
in the last decade. Organizers said that represented a change from
the 1980s, when rights activities in Arab countries were mostly
undertaken by non-Arab, Western-based organizations like Amnesty
International and the U.S.-based Human Rights Watch. A conference
document said that that had led to Arab governments dismissing
human rights pressures as ``an American plot to dominate the Arab
world.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arab groups have faced an uphill struggle. Activists in some
countries have been killed, have disappeared or have been held for
long periods in jail. Others, including some from Iraq, Libya,
Algeria and Tunisia, among other countries, have been forced to
operate from bases in Europe or the United States. Finding an Arab
country prepared to act as host for the meeting _ the first time a
broad array of Arab rights groups have met in a conference setting
_ was another problem. After Egypt refused, Morocco stepped
forward, the only country to offer itself as a location.
</P>
<P>
   The conference offered a showcase for Morocco, where King Hassan
II has taken steps recently to improve a rights record that had
attracted harsh criticism by political opponents and Western rights
groups at earlier periods of his 37-year reign. In the last year,
the 69-year-old king, promising to ``close the dossier'' on rights
cases, has freed more than two dozen political prisoners, promised
compensation to the families of others who disappeared while in
custody, and appointed as prime minister a former political exile,
Abderrahman Youssoufi, who formally opened the rights meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The 100 delegates to the conference held their sessions behind
closed doors, another reflection of the ``fear'' Hassan, the
Egyptian rights activist, said was inescapable for Arab rights
activists. The meeting concluded without establishing an umbrella
organization, and without any firm plan to hold another conference.
That was partly because of the practical difficulties of finding
another Arab site, and partly, Hassan said, because participants
concluded that the ``most effective work to be done at present'' is
at the level of individual Arab nations.

DEAL FOR JAMAL ANDERSON NOT `VIABLE,' PATRIOTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ It was an exciting story for a little while,
but it doesn't appear there is a future for Atlanta running back
Jamal Anderson in New England.
</P>
<P>
   Both Patriots executive Andy Wasynczuk and coach Pete Carroll
confirmed the Falcons called the Patriots on draft day about a
trade for Anderson, but the deal couldn't be worked out because of
salary cap problems, which prompted the Falcons to make Anderson
available in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a viable option for us right now,'' said Wasynczuk.
``We may still address the running spot in the next few months, but
we have to concentrate now on being able to sign our own draft
picks and getting them under our cap.''
</P>
<P>
   Wasynczuk said the draft day deal, which would have included New
England's two first-round picks, was not offered until the Patriots
``were on the clock,'' so they had little time to consider it.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said one of Atlanta coach Dan Reeves's assistants
called, but the Patriots never considered the offer. ``He has a bad
contract,'' Carroll said of Anderson. ``He only has a year left, so
you risk losing him after a year. Don't get me wrong, I love the
player, but we don't anticipate being able to do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who gained 1,440 yards last season as the Falcons went
14-2, is in the final season of a four-year deal. He will make $1.6
million this year and can become an unrestricted free agent next
season. But the Falcons have serious salary cap concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's agent, James Sims Jr., said he and his client are
seeking a six- or seven-year deal that includes a signing bonus
near $10 million and an average salary of $6 million-$7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Such a deal would put Anderson in the Terrell Davis-Barry
Sanders range.
</P>
<P>
   Sims currently is negotiating with the Falcons, but isn't
getting very far. Upon hearing that the Patriots refused to
consider a deal for Anderson because they didn't think they could
afford to sign him long term, Sims called Patriots vice president
of player personnel Bobby Grier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I basically told Bobby to stay tuned,'' said Sims. ``If things
didn't work out, who knows? The Patriots have a first-round pick
next year and the Falcons don't. I think Coach Reeves initiated the
talks, figuring he could get two No. 1 picks for Jamal and knowing
he had a lot of guys whose contracts were up. He knew the Patriots
needed a running back and the Patriots had discussed Jamal with
them last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Sims said if Anderson becomes a free agent, New England would be
one of his top choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamal is only 26,'' said Sims. ``He wants to go someplace
where he can win and where the team is committed to winning. New
England is definitely that place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited. If this were the Cincinnati Bengals we were
talking about I wouldn't be this excited. But the first thing Jamal
said to me was, `Imagine being in the same backfield with Drew
Bledsoe?' ''
</P>
<P>
   In an appearance on America On-Line, Anderson said,
``Apparently, the deal would have been for a couple of first-round
draft picks plus some additional picks. I know the Patriots have
had some recent problems at running back with Robert Edwards going
down with a knee injury, and I guess I'm flattered that they hold
me in such high regard.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, on the other side of the coin, I've always been very
happy in Atlanta and truly have high hopes about continuing the
success we've had as a team and that I've had personally. What this
does is make me realize that, after all, this is a business. The
bottom line is, I'm shocked by the whole thing and although I'm
sure everything will work out whether I get traded or not, it's
still pretty unsettling.''

SENATORS THREATEN TO LAUNCH AN ASSAULT ON ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two influential senators threatened Tuesday to
launch an assault on the entertainment industry, hoping to
``shame'' its leaders into changing the culture of violent movies,
music and video games aimed at children.
</P>
<P>
   The senators, Democrat Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut and
Republican Orrin Hatch of Utah, said that First Amendment concerns
probably would override any legislative attempts to coerce the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   But they suggested waging a campaign much like that against the
tobacco industry, which faced a growing wave of anti-smoking public
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us wants to resort to regulation,'' Lieberman said,
``but if the entertainment industry...continues to market death and
degradation to our children and continues to pay no heed to the
genuine bloodshed staining our communities, then one way or the
other, the government will act.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman and Hatch said they might call for an investigation by
either the Federal Trade Commission or the Justice Department to
see if the entertainment industry was violating laws against unfair
trade practices or false advertising related to the marketing of
violent entertainment to children.
</P>
<P>
   Several senators and witnesses said parental warnings and
ratings on movies, games and other merchandise often failed to
deter either the seller or the children that they were designed to
protect.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, which
held the hearing, had invited entertainment executives from several
companies, including Time-Warner, Nintendo, Sega and Sony, to
attend. But none showed up.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Valenti, president and chief executive officer of the
Motion Picture Association of America, agreed that the film
industry had an obligation to examine its work for ``gratuitous
violence, language or sensuality.'' But he testified that whatever
changes might be made should come from Hollywood, and not ``without
nagging or commands from anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the hearing seemed keyed to the school shootings, Sen.
Sam Brownback had scheduled it almost two months before Littleton,
Colo., was on anyone's political radar. The Kansas Republican has
been speaking out about violence in rock lyrics for several years.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the line to get into what otherwise would have been
a pretty standard congressional hearing snaked down the hallway and
two stairwells a half-hour before it began. Inside, cameras clicked
away and television lights reflected off polished marble walls.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the trappings of authority, most senators and
witnesses betrayed a sense of frustration and inability to come to
grips with the kind of cultural forces that many said they believe
played a part in the bloody rampage in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in an endless debate about First and Second Amendment
rights,'' Brownback said of the constitutional freedoms of
expression and the right to bear arms, ``while our children are
being traumatized.''
</P>
<P>
   As evidence, they displayed advertisements for video games
marketed to children where carnage appeared to be the only point,
such as ``Die by the Sword,'' that attracted customers with this
teaser: ``Lop off heads, sever limbs and bring your enemy to his
knees (literally).''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as former Education Secretary William Bennett did, showed
snippets from popular violent movies. The first was ``The
Basketball Diaries,'' where a disaffected teen-ager in a long black
leather coat and brandishing an automatic weapon has a dream
sequence where he walks into a classroom and mows down the
students. The other was the gory, top-grossing film ``Scream,''
where one by one, teen-agers are stabbed to death.
</P>
<P>
   At that, some in the hearing room audience turned away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had enough?'' said Bennett after the second clip.
</P>
<P>
   A frequent speaker and writer on values and popular culture,
Bennett said: ``I applaud Jack Valenti's courage in coming here. He
should go back (to Hollywood) and tell it collectively that
Americans have had enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Charles J. Chaput, the archbishop of Denver, who buried
some of the dead of Littleton last week, told the hearing: ``Common
sense tells us that violence of our music, our video games, our
films, and our television has to go somewhere _ and it goes
straight into the hearts of our children, to bear fruit in ways we
can't imagine. Until something like Littleton happens.''

   SKOPJE, Macedonia _ Betrayal is the theme of the story of
Slovinje. Of the village's 600 homes, 40 belonged to Serbs and the
rest to ethnic Albanians. The two communities lived on opposite
sides of the river but got along without major problems. They
shopped at each other's stores. Their kids competed at soccer. They
knew each other's names.
</P>
<P>
   When the violence began in Kosovo, the Serbs of Slovinje told
their ethnic Albanian neighbors they had nothing to fear from the
army or paramilitary, several refugees woefully recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ```We will protect you,' they promised, and then when the army
came, our own Serbs put on masks and joined in the butchery,'' said
Magribe Neziri. ``They knew who to single out. They knew who had
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, two mass graves were dug up in Slovinje, and 16
muddy corpses were laid out in a classroom of a village school,
said three men who were there. The bodies were covered with black
plastic but the heads were left exposed for purposes of
identification.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing who was who was hard. The Serbs had rampaged through
Slovinje on April 15 and 16, according to more than a dozen
witnesses, killing more than 40 people. The dead had been in the
ground for two weeks, and decomposition had begun its work of
returning dust to dust.
</P>
<P>
   Ferat Gashi, 62, almost buried another young man in the grave
set aside for his young nephew, Enver.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found Enver's driver's license in his pants or a horrible
mistake would have been made,'' said Gashi, his face a portrait of
sorrow. ``But then who is to say what is truly horrible anymore?''
</P>
<P>
   While 16 Albanians in Slovinje now have some privacy beneath the
soil, many others are assumed by relatives and friends to be lying
dead elsewhere, rotting in the debris of burned homes or washed up
on the rocky banks of the river.
</P>
<P>
   Gashi said that when he and others re-buried their kin,
authorities threatened them with death if they chanted any funeral
prayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps our silence helps them to deal with their shame,''
said a retired miner who was also present at the pantomime of a
funeral.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Slovinje, a village 10 miles south of Pristina,
Kosovo's capital, is an incomplete one without independent
confirmation. In separate interviews, 17 ethnic Albanians who had
been in Slovinje on April 15 and 16 told their stories to The New
York Times during the last week. Five of these refugees said they
had witnessed killings. A local teacher who has added up the
killings from witnesses' accounts puts the total at 44. A lawyer,
Naser Gashi, has compiled a list of the dead with 41 names.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewers for Human Rights Watch have also spoken with a half
dozen Slovinje refugees. They were told of many of the same
killings. A spare, but consistent account of the deaths has
appeared in at least one Albanian-language daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something terrible happened there, that's for sure,'' said
Benjamin Ward, a Human Rights Watch researcher. ``There was a great
deal of familiarity between the persecutors and the persecuted. One
is struck by the degree of trauma and the residual fear. Many of
these people still have family members there.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there are usually at least two sides to any
story, and Serbian testimonies have yet to be obtained.
</P>
<P>
   After Serbian forces began emptying cities and villages and NATO
bombing began, some of Slovinje's Albanians considered escaping to
Macedonia over the frigid mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Their Serbian acquaintances counseled against flight, several
Albanians say. On the night of April 14, some leaders of the
Serbian community called upon some of their Albanian counterparts.
``They told us the army was coming in, but we shouldn't be
afraid,'' said the teacher, who withheld his name in fear of harm
to his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said we could meet with the army at the school at 7 a.m.
the next day, but at 5 the army was already blocking a main road
with tanks. Some Serbian paramilitary had been hiding in the
village overnight, hiding in the house of someone who had told us
to stay,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Albanians were petrified. In a few hours, they saw smoke coming
from Okllap, a nearby Albanian village. There was little to do but
cower.
</P>
<P>
   In the early afternoon, Serbian forces entered the village and
began shooting into homes, witnesses said. A teen-age girl,
Fathushe Dubov, is believed by some to have been the first to die.
Sniper fire then cut down Rifat and Milaim Gashi. The paramilitary
began going house to house.
</P>
<P>
   People were beaten, report both those who saw it and those who
suffered it. Money was stolen and extorted. People were ordered to
flee.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Shehide Sopjani, 85, felt she was too old for such a sudden
departure, said her son, a retired miner who asked that his name
not be used. He said that she sat fearfully with another son,
Mehmet, who was nearly blind, and his frail wife, Qamile. The
rat-tat-tat of machine guns seemed to be everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them they have to come with me or we'd all be
massacred,'' said the miner, who recalled that his mother then
invoked an old Albanian expression: ``As the one who fed you from
the breast, I tell you to run from this house so that I can at
least know one of us will remain alive.''
</P>
<P>
   From the foothills, he looked back but could not see much. He
would only learn of his mother's fate when he took part in last
Friday's burials, he said. He was able to identify the body of his
mother by her earrings. His dead brother was recognizable by the
gaps in his teeth, his sister-in-law by a deformed leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things will haunt me forever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   With tanks blocking the main way out, the only open road passed
through the Serbian part of town. As Albanians tried to drive off,
they met a roadblock. ``Whoever the local Serbs didn't like, they
told the soldiers to order them out of the car,'' said the teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Gafurr Hyseni, an activist in the Mother Teresa Society, was
taken into a house and beaten, witnesses said. The house was set
ablaze. Hyseni never came out.
</P>
<P>
   At least three other men were pulled from their cars and killed,
said one witness. One man was Jakup Kryeziv. Another was Adem
Bytyqi, who was shot dead while trying to run. Faik Krasniqi was
executed and his nose and mouth were cut off, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Five men, including Omer and Enver Gashi, were ordered into a
yard along with their wives and children. ``Three men in ski masks
told everyone but the men to run away,'' said Omer's wife,
Nebahate, 31. ``Then we heard shooting and no one ever saw my
husband again until the mass graves were opened.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Albanians fled to Smallusha, a nearby village. But Serbian
forces chased them from there as well. By the next morning,
hundreds of people from both Smallusha and Slovinje found
themselves in a fearsome limbo, gathered in a field in the
foothills and unsure if the killing had ended.
</P>
<P>
   Another day of mayhem was ahead. Accounts differ as to who died
first in a burst of random shooting. Feroleze Bytyqi, who was
there, believes it was her brother, Hasan Bytyqi, 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was hit in the stomach'' with gun shots, said Bytyqi, 27, a
pregnant woman now living in a refugee camp. ``My father asked for
someone to help his boy, but the answer he got was a beating.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Her father lifted his wounded son onto the seat of a tractor,
Bytiqi said: ``The Serbs told my brother to put his hands up and
then they shot him 10 times. I saw this. I saw my brother die.''
</P>
<P>
   Men were separated from women and children, three eyewitnesses
said. Everyone was commanded to empty their pockets. Valuables were
stolen. Identification papers were put in a pile and set afire.
</P>
<P>
   Several men were then singled out for beatings, including Remzi
Limani, 30, Bytiqi's husband, who said he was one of them.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs taunted their captives. ``You wanted NATO, so let NATO
come and save you now,'' two Albanians recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The women and children were ordered to leave. ``Go into the
woods and die of hunger,'' Bytiqi said they were told. The group
wandered toward the mountains, looking over their shoulders to see
the fate of the men.
</P>
<P>
   The beatings were continuing, witnesses said. One particular
target was a well-built young man, Habib Dubova. When Dubova and a
few others successfully made a run for it, their captors were
furious, witnesses said. Other Serbs were called over and then they
huddled. Suddenly, they told the Albanians to run for their lives.
Three were quickly shot as they hurried up an incline toward the
woods, witnesses said. One of those shot was Fatmir Bytyqi, 30,
another of Feroleze Bytiqi's brothers. He lay wounded until a
Serbian soldier fired several bullets into his head, two witnesses
said.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 16 people died trying to sprint for safety, the
Albanians agree. Avni Sopiani, a mentally handicapped young man,
was said to be among those killed. A 34-year-old barber was
wounded, but his brother and a cousin helped him stumble along, he
said. He recently arrived in Macedonia and on Wednesday was lying
in a clinic at a refugee camp, awaiting surgery to have a bullet
removed from his buttock.
</P>
<P>
   Most men who escaped found their families in the hills around
other Albanian villages, several witnesses said. During nights,
some men would return to Slovinje to feed their farm animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were still soldiers around, but the local Serbs told us
to come back,'' recalled the teacher. ``They said, `Some innocent
Albanians were killed who weren't supposed to be.' They said they
were sorry and that we could all return now as long as we didn't
bring along any troublemakers.''
</P>
<P>
   On April 23, many Albanians did come back, some to search for
loved ones. This bitter homecoming lasted but a few hours before
the police began shooting in the air, the teacher said. The
Albanians again fled into the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Many chanced a second return a week later. And it was then that
the Serbian police agreed to unearth the dead. The Albanians were
given barely an hour to identify the dead and bury them. `'We were
not permitted to say even a word or look into each other's eyes,''
said Ferat Gashi.
</P>
<P>
   This time, he and dozens of others decided to leave for good.
They made their way to the border and now either live with
relatives or in hastily built tent cities.
</P>
<P>
   But hundreds of the Albanians have chosen to stay in Slovinje
and to see what happens next, according to the recent refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The local Serbs, they said, have told them everything is going
to be all right.

DON'T BLAME SEVERE WEATHER ON CLIMATE CHANGE, EXPERTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't be quick to chalk up this week's killer tornadoes to
global climate change.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists have speculated that extreme storms, such as the
series of tornadoes that struck Kansas and Oklahoma on Monday, may
become more frequent with global warming.
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, there's little evidence that links tornadoes and
hurricanes to climate change.
</P>
<P>
   There are strong indicators that the globe's climate is
changing. Temperatures have definitely increased the last dozen
years, and precipitation also may be up.
</P>
<P>
   But evidence of an increase in the frequency of tornadoes and
hurricanes just isn't there, say some scientists who are
researching the effects of global climate change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't seen an increase as yet,'' said Eugene Takle, a
professor of atmospheric science at Iowa State University. ``But
there's definitely a lot more property damage'' because of the
weather.
</P>
<P>
   Those damages are due primarily to a failure to take the proper
preventive steps. Such efforts include building better structures;
locating structures out of areas prone to disaster; and acting on
improved storm warnings.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the deadliest tornado years on record occurred in the
1950s and 1960s. In 1953, for example, 150 persons died in Texas in
May; on May 25, 1955, 81 died in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Federal maps and data of the areas of the United States most
prone to devastating tornadoes lead you straight to Kansas,
Oklahoma and Texas, the three most tornado-prone states.
</P>
<P>
   May is also the heaviest tornado month. Of the 787 tornadoes
that annually occur in the United States, on average, 171 occur in
May, according to federal climate data.

<P>
   DILI, Indonesia _ After a recent surge of violence here in East
Timor, Julio Vicento limped into the Motael Clinic with a bullet
buried in his ankle. He had fled the military hospital, he said,
afraid that he might be killed there.
</P>
<P>
   Now he was trying to decide which was worse, the pain in his leg
or the possibility that soldiers might find him at the clinic and
seize him while he was being treated.
</P>
<P>
   Only six patients were in the ward of the private clinic, all of
them with severe gunshot or stab wounds. Those who could had fled
this clinic, too, and the chief doctor here, Dan Murphy, said he
could not blame them.
</P>
<P>
   The previous weekend ``was horrible here,'' said Murphy, an
American from Iowa. ``None of us felt secure. There were hand
grenades and gunshots going off. And then at night we had militia
outside yelling and screaming: `Why are you taking care of those
people? We're coming in to get them.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you feel very vulnerable,'' he said. ``You just have
to focus on your work. If they come in shooting, what can you do?
Nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Many victims of a brutal military-backed group here, known as
the Red and White Militia, are too frightened to seek medical care.
Scores of people have been killed since January and untold numbers
wounded, some in remote areas with little access to medical care.
</P>
<P>
   For three days recently, the volunteer militia rampaged through
this drab, tiny seaside capital, firing guns and hacking at their
victims with knives and cutlasses. Their targets were separatist
guerrillas and their supporters _ people who have been fighting
against the military since Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   The victims, like Vicento, faced what seemed a difficult choice.
</P>
<P>
   The only hospital here is run by the military and for years
unconfirmed tales have circulated about men who have been killed
and women who have been involuntarily sterilized by military
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Other health care workers, most of them from outside East Timor,
are now fleeing the small province of 800,000 people, terrified by
the threats and killings. Not only the violence of the long-running
war, but also epidemics of malaria and tuberculosis are sweeping
through East Timor untreated, Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   Since last November, Murphy, who has also worked in Mozambique,
has built the Motael Clinic into a haven for those who fear the
military and for other poor people here. The clinic has attracted
several other visiting foreign doctors, including Dr. Kevin Baker,
an Australian who is now the only surgeon in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   For the doctors here, the challenge is more than purely medical.
It is a test of their personal fortitude, and their ingenuity.
</P>
<P>
   Baker, for example, is more than a surgeon. He is also a
handyman, jury-rigging equipment that is not available here.
</P>
<P>
   When Salustian Martinez, 21, was carried into the clinic with a
gunshot wound in his leg, the doctor went to the hardware store for
a six-inch nail to insert as a pin. While there, he bought a
hacksaw too, just in case Martinez's leg needed to be amputated. It
didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly they attacked,'' Martinez said in a whisper,
describing his injury as he waited for his operation. ``We ran and
I was shot from behind. Suddenly they came. They shouted, `Attack!'
and I ran. I was shot and I hid in a pigsty.''
</P>
<P>
   On a bed beside him lay Alfredo dos Santos, 20, who had been
stabbed in the chest. A rosary lay around his neck, and a tube
drained fluid from his right lung. ``I was just sitting there and
suddenly people attacked,'' he said. ``I was stabbed. It was the
Red and White Militia. They didn't say anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Vicento was trying to decide whether to have an operation to
remove the bullet from his ankle. He curled and uncurled his X-ray
nervously as he talked, with its telltale bright white dot lodged
between the gray bones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shot from a truck,'' he said. ``The day before, we had
had a village meeting and the military had promised there would be
no more attacks. So villagers who had been hiding in the forest
came back. Then they attacked us.''
</P>
<P>
   Vicento, 32, made no secret of his separatist sympathies. It was
a family legacy, he said. His father, a guerrilla, had been killed
at the very start of the war, when Vicento was 7. His mother had
died soon afterward, of grief, he said. Vicento, still a child, had
carried on the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want freedom even if we have to die for it,'' he said.
``All of my family is in the hills now. If they want to kill me, go
ahead. I can defend myself.''
</P>
<P>
   He sounded much less resolute as he talked about his operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid that when I'm lying there empty-handed, someone
from the militia will come and get me,'' he said. ``I'll have
stitches in my leg and I won't be able to run or walk fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone asked him how fast he could run with a bullet in his
ankle. The question seemed to make sense to him.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward he limped down the clinic's narrow corridor
toward the operating room, Baker by his side and a rosary clutched
tightly in his fist, to have the bullet removed.

 Haysville, a town familiar with calamity, suffers another dose  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLINGER and TOM PERRIN  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA, Kan. _ The people of Haysville, just south of Wichita,
say they've had their fill of disasters.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, a tornado sliced through the west side of town on a
rampage that killed 19 persons in Sedgwick and Butler counties.
Then last year, the DeBruce Grain elevator exploded, killing seven
workers and again putting Haysville on the national news map.
</P>
<P>
   But the death and damage from the tornado that smashed into the
center of Haysville about 8:30 p.m. Monday represented by far the
worst calamity that anyone in this town of 9,500 could remember.
</P>
<P>
   After ravaging Haysville's business district and damaging homes,
the twister moved into south Wichita. In its wake, it left five
people dead and scores injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, this was devastating to our downtown core area and
residential area,'' said Haysville Mayor Tim Norton. ``It's just
desolate. We're going to have a lot of rebuilding.''
</P>
<P>
   The tornado first struck just south of Haysville, ripping out
trees, destroying a home and damaging several others. It then
traveled north along railroad tracks that run through the center of
town.
</P>
<P>
   Officials there estimated that about 150 homes were either
damaged or destroyed, along with 27 businesses, three churches and
four historic buildings in the ``old part'' of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Norton said several buildings in that area were being restored
with the hope that one day, the area could become an attraction
with brick streets and gaslights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, that's out the window now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the damage occurred just east of the railroad tracks
along a two-mile stretch. Hit especially hard was the business
district in the heart of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Norton said the administrative offices of the town's largest
private employer, Norland Plastics, were turned into rubble by the
tornado.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bill Graves stood near the intersection and surveyed the
destruction. All around him, heavy equipment was removing debris,
and electrical workers were repairing power lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are so resilient,'' Graves said. ``Folks are already
over there cleaning up their lots. Even though there's not a house
standing there, they're already trying to figure out how to rebuild
their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Graves said both the state and federal governments had issued
emergency disaster declarations for Sedgwick County.
</P>
<P>
   Victims of the storm were allowed to return to their homes about
noon Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bill and Rhonda Sherwood looked through their heavily damaged
home for items to take with them. The Sherwoods fled to the
basement Monday night and emerged to find a new ``skylight'' where
the roof had been.
</P>
<P>
   While many of their neighbors were evacuated to a nearby church,
the Sherwoods spent the night in their relatively undamaged
bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just want to stay at home and protect your stuff,'' she
said, adding that authorities had asked them to leave several
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my home,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A block away on Main Street, Deanna Turpin, her 27-year-old son,
Paul, and 17-year-old daughter, Jessica, were staring at what was
left of their home.
</P>
<P>
   Turpin said she was prepared to ride out the storm, but fled to
the basement at her son's insistence. His determination probably
saved them, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``About that time all the windows blew out and our ears started
popping,'' she said. ``Thanks to him, we're OK.''
</P>
<P>
   A ladder sitting just outside the house came through the kitchen
window, and part of Turpin's roof collapsed. Trees around her yard
were stripped bare of their limbs or were bent completely over. A
blue mattress hung about 20 feet up in a tree behind her house.
</P>
<P>
   Haysville officials said full electrical power won't be restored
until the end of the week. It will take a lot longer, Norton said,
to restore the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're still in shock,'' he said. ``I'm sure we'll
begin the grieving process when that wears off.''
</P>
<P>
   In south Wichita, two adjoining mobile home parks were
devastated.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Chief Terri Moses of the Wichita Police Department said
the tornado destroyed 100 mobile homes in the Lakeshore and
Pacesetter mobile home parks.
</P>
<P>
   At the Machinists Hall in south Wichita on Tuesday, a steady
flow of people visited a Red Cross Center set up for those seeking
news about loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all looking for someone,'' said Darla Ward, shelter
manager for the Red Cross. She said volunteers were taking
information and then calling people later after relatives and
friends were located.
</P>
<P>
   Some areas of the adjoining mobile home parks escaped major
damage, while other parts were totally destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Some mobile homes were tossed into a nearby lake.
</P>
<P>
   Overturned cars and twisted sheet metal lay about the park.
Personal belongings were scattered everywhere: toys, playing cards,
televisions, furniture.
</P>
<P>
   City workers cleared a pathway on main roads through the mobile
home parks so residents could reach their homes.
</P>
<P>
   At 1 p.m. Tuesday, residents who didn't remain in their homes
overnight were allowed back in, along with family members. What
they returned to, in many cases, was difficult to take.
</P>
<P>
   Some people lost everything _ family possessions, pictures,
furniture and appliances.
</P>
<P>
   What had been the home of David and Misty Seeber was a 10-foot
pile of ruin Tuesday afternoon. Like others at the Lakeshore Mobile
Home Park, the young couple spent the day trying to salvage
whatever memories they could uncover.
</P>
<P>
   On the bright side, a neighbor found their two cockatiel birds
alive and handed them to a police officer, who returned them. The
Seebers also found a photo album from their wedding two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thank God for saving both of our lives,'' David Seeber said.
</P>
<P>
   Shena Miloni and her three children were even luckier. Their
mobile home sustained only a couple of small holes and a lost
carport and a broken television antenna. A 40-foot elm tree fell
parallel to their house, barely missing it.
</P>
<P>
   During the storm, they huddled in the bathroom and prayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was afraid of dying and wishing it could get over with,''
Miloni said.

<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY, Okla. _ For the fifth time in three days, Capt.
James Smith and a band of other National Guardsmen waded into a
thorny thicket Wednesday morning to search a muddy creek bed near
here for the bodies, or parts of bodies, of those who remain
missing after Monday's tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   And for the fifth time, after tromping for nearly two hours
through virtually impenetrable brush in the Bridge Creek community,
the soldiers came up empty. Smith, an eighth-grade history teacher
from Rowlett, Texas, and the father of eight-week-old twins, said
he had mixed feelings about whether he wants the search to be more
fruitful.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're hoping and praying that the person's alive, but if
they're out there you want to find them,'' he said. ``Because for
every minute that person's dead you know that family is suffering,
and you're thinking, `What if it was my family?'''
</P>
<P>
   As this area recovers from this week's devastating storm, which
has accounted for 38 deaths in the Oklahoma City area and 5 in a
community south of Wichita, Kan., no task has been more gruesome
than the search for the missing. It has been complicated by
significant confusion, with the authorities apparently uncertain
about how many people really have yet to be found.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Blakeney, director of operations for the Oklahoma State
Medical Examiner, said at a news conference Wednesday afternoon
that about 100 people may still be missing. But some of those
people, Blakeney said, may have been counted twice. Others may be
among the 15 dead who have yet to be identified. And still others
may be among those who are unconscious and unidentified at area
hospitals. Blakeney said that his office hopes to come up with a
computerized index of the missing on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The chaos was illustrated Wednesday by the disclosure by Stan
Florence, the sheriff of Grady County, that he had inaccurately
announced on Tuesday that a missing woman had been found alive
under debris in Bridge Creek. Florence said he had received
incorrect information.
</P>
<P>
   Because the tornadoes struck such a broad area, because they
were powerful enough to fling objects dozens of miles away, and
because communication is hampered by downed telephone and power
lines, the search for bodies has been painstaking.
</P>
<P>
   At midday in Bridge Creek, where 11 bodies were found shortly
after the tornado, members of a search and rescue team found an
unattached leg and foot under debris near what had been a homesite.
They covered the body parts with a cardboard box, marked it with an
orange flag, and then began to thoroughly search the area for other
remains. ``We'll see if it's from one of the bodies already
recovered,'' said Gene Christian, the district attorney for the
area. ``It's not unusual for bodies in these situations to have an
amputation.''
</P>
<P>
   Search and rescue officials throughout the area said that the
widespread havoc spread by Monday's tornadoes created special
problems even for agencies accustomed to such missions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go to look for someone in a house, but the house is
gone,'' said Jack Briggs, an assistant fire chief in Moore, an
Oklahoma City suburb that was heavily damaged by the storm. ``You
go to look for the street, but the whole street is gone. In the
situation we've got here, sometimes you go to look and the whole
neighborhood is gone.''

 &HT;    Dispute over releasing Olympic records heads to court
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The state attorney general demanded Wednesday that
Billy Payne's private foundation open Atlanta's Olympic bid records
to the public. The Georgia Amateur Athletics Foundation responded
by taking the dispute to court.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all due respect for the almost herculean effort required
by those who organized the bid to bring the Olympic Games to
Georgia,'' Attorney General Thurbert Baker wrote to Payne's
attorney, ``they were not the GAAF Olympics. They were the Atlanta
Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   After receiving the attorney general's letter early Wednesday,
the GAAF later in the day announced it had filed suit seeking a
court's opinion that the records are private and not subject to
state Open Records laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to litigate this in court, we'll litigate this in
court,'' Baker said after learning of the foundation's action late
in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Payne, GAAF chairman, and his attorneys say that the Olympic bid
campaign was a private effort organized by private individuals.
Baker, Gov. Roy Barnes and lawyers representing The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution argued the bid effort and the Olympics were
public events and the complete historical record of those events
should be made public.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to Payne's attorney, which was copied to Barnes,
Baker cited the ``overwhelmingly public nature of the 1996
Olympics,'' as well as the ``inextricable link between private
interests and governmental entities'' in the bid campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have acknowledged reaching an impasse. Under threat
of the attorney general taking legal action, the GAAF filed a
lawsuit in Fulton County Superior Court seeking a declaration that
the Games were private.
</P>
<P>
   The suit seeks to preserve ``the established rights to privacy
of the foundation's donors, volunteers and staff,'' according to
spokesman Lee Echols of the GAAF, which Payne created in 1987 to
bid for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of negotiations with the attorney general's office
and the newspaper's attorneys, Payne's foundation on Friday opened
to public view nine of the 1,400 boxes containing Olympic documents
stored at the Atlanta History Center.
</P>
<P>
   However, entire file folders of materials, primarily dealing
with financial matters, had been removed before the material was
made public.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said any documents purged from the records that the GAAF
believes fall under the law's ``privacy'' exception must be
reviewed by his office, as well as by the newspaper's attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general cautioned that the privacy exception would
not cover materials that could be considered ``embarrassing.'' Only
a document that would amount to a ``tortious invasion of privacy''
could be withheld from disclosure, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The purged files have not been identified or presented for
review, as earlier agreed, Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   GAAF attorney Joseph Bankoff disputed Baker's account. He said
the foundation had not agreed to show the removed files to
newspaper lawyers, but it was willing to give them to Baker for
review.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process you insist upon would simply leave us in the
position of allowing counsel for the paper to fish through all GAAF
records to see what is of interest,'' Bankoff wrote in a response
to Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Baker referred to the ``cloud of scandal'' over Salt Lake City's
bid for the 2002 Winter Games that has ``cast a shadow'' over other
cities' efforts to lobby the International Olympic Committee
delegates. Payne has said that no such corruption marred the bid to
bring the Games to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But Baker said Payne's ``steadfast refusal to make the documents
available to the public, however, lends credence to the belief that
GAAF has something to hide.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker said that ``allowing public access to these documents on
an expeditious basis would certainly do much to bolster GAAF's
assurances that this is not the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Bankoff responded that there is no shadow over the Games ``other
than the one manufactured by'' the Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attorney general is plainly right that the law requires _
and the current cloud of scandal demands _ immediate disclosure of
the records by GAAF and the Atlanta History Center,'' said Peter
Canfield, a lawyer representing the newspaper in its effort to
obtain access to the bid records. ``In bringing the Olympics to
Atlanta, GAAF did not act privately. It acted in the official name
of the city and state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's hope that what's most embarrassing about the records is
that they've been kept secret,'' Canfield said.

 OKLAHOMA CITY, Okla.: is gone.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the hours since the storms struck, Red Cross volunteers have
been compiling lists of both missing and located persons on a
computer in the city's makeshift emergency center and delivering
copies of those lists to Briggs. Often, the lists contain only a
name and little else, but Briggs said each report is pursued as
thoroughly as possible. His department supervised 18 dog-assisted
searches Wednesday morning in addition to visiting every known
address where a person's location has been questioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these reports are people calling in from out of
town,'' he said, ``and saying they just haven't heard from
so-and-so in a while. That's a lot different than a neighbor
telling us that someone never came out of their house after the
storm.'' He added: ``Sometimes we'll be out talking to someone in
their yard when a radio call comes in that they're missing. That's
just what happens when you've got no phones, no electricity, and
this kind of devastation.''
</P>
<P>
   John Hill, a rescue worker from Abilene, Tex., said that the
search in Moore had been complicated because all the search dogs
had to go on was the general scent of humans. ``Often, the dogs
will bark or sit down or give whatever their indication is but
there's no one there,'' he said. ``Mostly it's just blood on the
boards or dirty diapers or the clothing people were wearing before
they changed.''
</P>
<P>
   In Bridge Creek, where Sheriff Florence believes that four or
five people remain missing, the Army National Guard has been
assisting law enforcement agencies in repetitive searches. The
sheriff said that scuba divers may soon search muddy ponds.
</P>
<P>
   As Smith and his men searched the creek bed this morning,
looking for a 26-year-old mother in an area where other bodies have
been found, they walked through layers of debris that had been
flung into the woods from nearby mobile homes. As they walked in
camouflage through the remains of a family's life _ a red-suited
teddy bear, inspirational books, a roll of Christmas wrapping paper
_ they also came across a cotton-mouth snake disturbed by the
intrusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take your time guys,'' Smith instructed his crew of Guardsmen,
which included a nursing student, a law student, a car mechanic and
a construction worker. ``Look under things and don't just look
down. Look up in the trees.''
</P>
<P>
   One soldier found a framed collage of photographs of smiling
young women, and said it would be passed along to the medical
examiner to help with possible identifications. In past searches,
one soldier found and collected a grainy sonogram image. ``He just
couldn't leave it out there,'' said Capt. Barry J. Guidry.

   Those who dine at the American Restaurant in Kansas City are
familiar with the artistry of a squash stuffed with peekytoe crab
or mustard-braised short ribs on a bed of wide noodles.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, the rest of the country applauded fine dining
in Kansas City as Michael Smith and Debbie Gold, co-executive chefs
at the American since 1994, were honored with a James Beard Award
for Best Chef of the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   The husband-and-wife duo received the award during a black-tie
dinner at the Marriott Marquis in New York. It was Smith and Gold's
third consecutive nomination, and the first win for a chef from
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The awards were created almost a decade ago to honor the late
culinarian James Beard, considered the father of American
gastronomy. Highly coveted, the awards are widely regarded as the
culinary equivalent of an Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   The honor comes as the American marks its 25th anniversary. Gold
and Smith were in elementary school when James Beard served as a
consultant for the restaurant in the mid-'70s.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good night for Kansas City, proving the city is
becoming more than a blip on the country's food radar screen. Also
a winner was Lidia Bastianich, chef//owner of Felidia's in New York
and Lidia's in Kansas City. She was named Best Chef of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's all just one more piece of evidence...that we're
really coming of age as a restaurant town,'' says Art Siemering, a
trend-tracker for the food industry based in Kansas City and a
judge for the Beard Awards for the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   Although Siemering says other local chefs' names have appeared
on the preliminary nominee list recently, for the past decade
Midwest honors have been dominated by Chicago chefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good,'' Michael Smith said of the award. ``But I
always look forward to the chase....You're walking around after and
you don't really know what to say to (the other chefs). Before,
we've always said, `We'll do it next year!' ''
</P>
<P>
   News of the award was greeted with enthusiasm by Patrick Weber,
chef at the up-and-coming Stolen Grill in Westport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows about our barbecue and Stroud's (fried
chicken). And we're proud about those, but we're also coming of age
in fine dining. We're getting more respect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to their serving top-of-the-line cuisine, Weber
credits Smith and Gold with having trained many of the city's best
cooks.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 38, and Gold, 35, came to Kansas City from Chicago in
March 1994. They met at the famed Charlie Trotter's there. They
share responsibilities at the American, a co-executive chef
position that makes them one of a handful of high-profile
husband-and-wife chef teams in the country.
</P>
<P>
   In the process of sharing their workday, they have also learned
to juggle their schedules to care for their toddler daughter,
Misha, a frequent visitor to the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   With their newfound recognition, they will also learn to balance
work with a higher level of fame. They can expect to be more in
demand for public appearances ranging from profiles in national
publications, guest appearances on TV and possibly even cookbook or
gourmet food tie-ins.

NATIONAL SEMICONDUCTOR PLANS TO EXIT THE CHIP BUSINESS   
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Maine, Calif.)   By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Less than two years after paying $550 million
for Cyrix Corp. to enter the personal computer microprocessor
business, National Semiconductor Corp. said Wednesday that it was
exiting that market.
</P>
<P>
   National said it would seek a buyer for the business as well as
for its related chip plant in South Portland, Maine, and that it
would cut 550 jobs, or 4.8 percent of its workforce, and take a
related charge of $250 million to $300 million in the fourth
quarter ending May 30.
</P>
<P>
   National executives said that the PC processor business was
unprofitable as a result of the price wars between Intel Corp. and
Advanced Micro Devices Inc. Sustained losses from the processor
division dragged down the entire company, National said,
attributing its losses for the past year to it, even though other
parts of the company's business were relatively healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Without the PC chip losses, National said, it expects to return
to profitability in its second fiscal quarter, which ends in
November. However, the sale of the plant, and the write-off of the
Cyrix business, should no buyer materialize, could lead to further
charges.
</P>
<P>
   National shares rose more than 20 percent to close at $17.6875,
up $3.0625, on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock had
previously gained on rumors that National was selling the Cyrix
business to International Business Machines &UR;  &LR; Corp. National did not
name a buyer, but said it was holding discussions with several
potential suitors.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Peck, an analyst with S.G. Cowen, said that while the chip
factory would be an easy sale, the Cyrix business ``wasn't all that
appealing back in the heyday of the microprocessor business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, it's hard to imagine how you would profit from that
product,'' he said. ``National couldn't do it; AMD can't do it, and
Intel probably couldn't do it at the low end. It was an enormous
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Cyrix and Advanced Micro had an early lead in microprocessors
for the sub-$1,000 PC market, which Intel initially ignored. But
Intel caught up rapidly, and by aggressively lowering prices and
improving the performance of its low-end product line, dubbed
Celeron, eroded all profitability for its rivals. Further, Advanced
Micro and National both had manufacturing difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not believing Intel would come after us in the low-end space
was a mistake,'' said Brian L. Halla, National's chairman,
president and chief executive. ``It doesn't make sense for us to go
slug it out with Intel,'' he said. ``We know, and the world knows,
that we don't have the resources.''
</P>
<P>
   National will pursue the market for so-called information
appliances, small communications and consumer electronics devices,
using the computer-on-a-chip technology developed by Cyrix.
National will also try to gain ground in the market for analog
chips, used to process audio and video signals, Halla said, with a
goal of being the No. 1 analog chip company. He argued the
microprocessor business could be attractive to the right buyer,
perhaps without the factory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The obvious buyer would be IBM, but I have to assume they were
in discussions and that fell through,'' said Michael Slater, editor
of the Microprocessor Report, an industry newsletter. Other
potential buyers would include ST Micro electronics, &UR;  &LR; the European
chip company, although it has, like National indicated it will
pursue the information appliance market, and perhaps Texas
Instruments Inc., he said.
</P>
<P>
   Slater said other makers of so called X86 Intel-compatible
chips, like Integrated Device Technology Inc., are also feeling
pressured. ``I think this is not the end of the turmoil,'' he said.
``AMD clearly needs to start executing better, and may need a
partner,'' he said, adding that an IBM partnership with AMD might
make more sense than acquiring Cyrix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is the last X86 business that will be put
up for sale,'' he said.

FAMILY'S LOTTERY WINNINGS IS TWICE AS NICE 
</HEADLINE>

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Who says it's nearly impossible to win at
Powerball?
</P>
<P>
   It's happened twice in the Dreiling family.
</P>
<P>
   Grandview resident Regina Dreiling was introduced Tuesday as the
winner of last weekend's $47 million Powerball jackpot. Four years
ago, her husband's distant cousin won $31.2 million in a Kansas
Powerball drawing.
</P>
<P>
   The cousin will get around $1 million a year until 2015. Regina
Dreiling chose to take her money in one lump sum of $25.6 million
rather than the $47 million paid out over 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Dreiling, 37, was the only player to match all six numbers in
Saturday's drawing. She still has not decided what to do with the
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does seem like a dream. It still seems like a dream,''
Dreiling said.
</P>
<P>
   She bought the lucky ticket at a 7-Eleven Food Store in
Grandview, on her way home from work last week. She had done the
same thing every Friday night for at least three years. Once
before, she won $100.
</P>
<P>
   She usually calls to get the winning numbers on Saturday night,
but this time she fell asleep and didn't call until Sunday morning
around 9:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe it, I just hung up and kept calling back,''
she said. ``Then I had my husband call and he couldn't believe
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark and Regina Dreiling, who have been married for seven years,
slept very little Sunday night. They kept the ticket hidden until
they redeemed it at the lottery office Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-Eleven store got $50,000 for selling the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Branch, a field consultant trainee at the 7-Eleven, said
this is the first time that store has sold a winning ticket. He
said the money will go into a corporate fund to benefit
stockholders.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, Uncle Sam will get his cut. Dreiling will pay a
little more than $1 million in state taxes and about $7.2 million
in federal taxes, lottery officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dreilings have no children. They invited relatives to their
home so they could share the good news. Some thought they were
joking.
</P>
<P>
   The millionaire cousin's advice: Change your phone number and
get a tax lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The Dreilings say it's too early to tell if they will need that
advice. For now, they're just trying to cope with what's happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pretty much walked around in a daze for a whole day,'' Mark
Dreiling said. He said they're not sure what they want to do first.
</P>
<P>
   Regina Dreiling, who drives an '82 Oldsmobile Cutlass, would
like a new car. Mark Dreiling, 38, says he's always wanted to go to
Tahiti.
</P>
<P>
   Regina Dreiling said she plans to quit her job as a secretary
for a security company after 14 years there.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Dreiling, who for 15 years has been part owner of
Dreiling's Ornamental Iron Inc. with his father, said he won't quit
immediately. However, he said he will ``sure find other things to
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Work is a word that I want to take out of my vocabulary,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The couple plan to stay in the area, but they want to move into
a new home. Regina Dreiling will continue buying lottery tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The Dreilings and their family members say it still doesn't seem
real.
</P>
<P>
   ``(When they told me,) I just walked back out; I couldn't
believe it,'' Mark Dreiling's father, Ed Dreiling, said. ``I
grabbed her and congratulated her.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the elder Dreiling said, he will have to persuade his other
son to take over the business.

U.S. SUSPENDS SALES OF HANDGUNS TO VENEZUELA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)   By RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration has suspended sales of
handguns to Venezuelan companies, one of the largest foreign
markets for American gun sellers, because of concern that many of
the guns were ending up in the hands of narcotics gangs and
guerrilla groups in neighboring Colombia, American officials said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   According to a State Department report on arms sales, which has
not been made public, licenses were issued for the sale of more
than 80,000 handguns from the United States to dealers in Venezuela
last year, a volume three times that of 1997 and seven times that
of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   That ``dramatic increase'' caused the Clinton administration to
undertake an investigation and stop accepting new license
applications pending the outcome, an official said. A brief
investigation last year, by both the Customs Agency and the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, concluded that there was a ``good
likelihood'' that handguns licensed for sale in Venezuela were
being diverted to Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   The sales suspension is unusual, only the third or fourth time
that the United States has blocked sales of handguns to a foreign
country, an administration official said. Three years ago, the
administration suspended sales of handguns to dealers in Paraguay
after Brazilian officials complained that thousands were pouring
across the border; that ban remains in place.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the Clinton administration stopped issuing licenses
for handgun sales in Britain, after it decided that the guns going
there were often sold to terrorists, organized criminal gangs and
to warring parties in the Balkans and Africa. That suspension has
since been lifted, but handgun sales in Britain have fallen off
sharply, American officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has been working with Latin American
countries to tighten the controls on weapons sales. The
Organization of American States has adopted a treaty on arms sales,
which is awaiting ratification in the Senate. By executive order
last July, President Clinton instituted regulations, meant to be a
model for other countries, that are intended to regulate the import
and export of handguns and rifles.
</P>
<P>
   The Venezuelan ambassador to the United States, Alfredo
Toro-Hardy, said that he was not aware of the State Department's
action, which was taken early last month, but that he knew the flow
of guns from the United States to his country had widened
significantly through improper permits and other illegal channels.
He added that the current government, which took office in
February, was taking ``strict measures to restrict the issuance of
licenses.''
</P>
<P>
   A private arms control organization, the Council for a Livable
World Education Fund, commended the suspension, but also raised
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shutting down the gun spigot to Venezuela was a prudent
move,'' said Thomas Cardamone Jr., director of the arms control
project at the fund. ``But why wasn't the suspension of new
licenses imposed earlier?'' Cardamone called for a congressional
investigation ``to insure that a similar situation does not occur
in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Cardamone called for a closer look at handgun
sales in the Philippines and South Africa. In 1997, American
companies were licensed to sell 35,000 handguns in the Philippines
and 29,000 in South Africa, a country plagued by a proliferation of
weapons and rising crime.
</P>
<P>
   A Clinton administration official said one reason the United
States had not acted earlier against Venezuela was that ``we have
American firms in the gun-selling business.''
</P>
<P>
   The largest seller of handguns in Venezuela last year was Valor
Corp., in Cape Coral, Fla., according to American licensing
applications. Valor received 95 of the approximately 240 licenses
approved. (A license can apply to more than a single gun; in one
instance in Venezuela, for example, one license was for 1,200
handguns.)
</P>
<P>
   An employee at Valor, who declined to identify herself, said the
only person who could answer questions was the owner, who would not
be available until the end of May.
</P>
<P>
   The second largest seller was Baxter South, according to
American licensing documents. The company declined to answer any
questions. ``We do not give any information to the press,'' said a
woman who answered the telephone at the company's headquarters in
Miami.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The prevailing optimism that year 2000 computer problems will
not seriously affect American business is premature, according to
two new studies of government filings by the nation's largest
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The studies focused on quarterly financial reports in which
companies disclose to the Securities and Exchange Commission how
much they had spent through the end of last year to deal with year
2000 computer malfunctions.
</P>
<P>
   The authors of both studies concluded that although the written
descriptions of the corporate year 2000 projects are uniformly
rosy, the actual spending figures suggest that many large companies
had left themselves just one year to complete over half their year
2000 work.
</P>
<P>
   The filings also showed that estimates of the total cost of
dealing with the year 2000 problem continued to rise in the last
three months of last year, albeit at a slower pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``A significant number of companies in every industry sector
started late and too much work remains for them to finish in
1999,'' said Steven Hock, president of Triaxsys Research,
summarizing the findings on a report to be issued Thursday on SEC
disclosure statements.
</P>
<P>
   The statements were filed from January through March by 647 of
the 1,000 largest companies as listed by Fortune magazine. ``Some
are just not going to make it in time and will be forced to rely
heavily on contingency plans and crisis management to avoid serious
business disruptions,'' Hock said.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Yardeni, the chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities
in New York, said his analysis of the disclosure statements of 372
of the 500 companies making up the Standard &AMP; Poor's stock index,
which he plans to release by the end of this week, is similarly
troubling. Just 44 of the companies _ under 12 percent _ had spent
as much as 75 percent of their projected budget by the end of last
year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This doesn't mean that the others are not going to get the job
done,'' said Yardeni, who has been Wall Street's most prominent
pessimist on year 2000 issues. ``It does mean that they aren't
leaving themselves much time.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies rushing to catch up are more likely to make mistakes,
cut corners on testing and prepare inadequate contingency plans,
Yardeni and many year 2000 project managers said.
</P>
<P>
   Year 2000 experts caution against putting too much weight on the
spending and budget data. The government does not audit it for
accuracy. The figures can move sharply for individual companies
from quarter to quarter. Sun Microsystems, a company identified as
a laggard by Triaxsys with just 14 percent of its budget having
been spent, jumped to 48 percent in the first three months of this
year.
</P>
<P>
   And a conservative company like Sun, which has budgeted money to
audit suppliers in the coming months, may take longer to complete
its spending than a company setting aside little or nothing for
such last-minute precautions.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, because the world has never experienced anything like
the year 2000 computer challenge, no one can be certain that a
company leaving much of its spending for this year is running major
risks. Indeed, recent government and industry reports of tests
performed on renovated systems have been so successful that
confidence is growing that major disruptions are unlikely, at least
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 problem, often known as Y2K or the Millennium Bug,
stems from the widespread use of just two digits to represent the
year in dates, such as 99 for 1999. Some computers, software and
electronic machinery read 00 as 1900 instead of 2000 while others
do not recognize it as a valid date. Some faulty systems freeze
while others continue operating but produce erroneous data or
gibberish.

   Comparisons of spending figures for individual companies can be
tricky because there is no national standard.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the figures reported to the government involve spending
to fix the software and equipment a company needs for its daily
operations, but the spending at some companies may also include
sums to update computer-based products the company sells to others
or help key suppliers prepare.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative budgets may also include substantial contingency
planning. 3Com, a Santa Clara, Calif., computer networking company,
has spent just $3 million out of a potential budget of $25 million
to $35 million through the first three months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Bruner, the company's controller, said that 3Com is ``on
schedule'' to complete its major remediation programs but that the
company had also gone through _ and included in its budget _ money
for contingency plans if year 2000 setbacks occur.
</P>
<P>
   But Hock and Yardeni said that while it might be mistaken to
leap to conclusions about any single company based on its spending
reports, the collective figures underscore that so much work
remains to be done that the country should guard against
complacency.

HASTERT RESISTS GOP PUSH FOR EARLY VOTE ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE
REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Speaker Dennis Hastert met Wednesday with more than
two dozen House Republicans who were pushing for an early vote on
overhauling the nation's campaign finance laws, but he refused to
commit to act earlier than the end of September.
</P>
<P>
   Although majorities in both the House and Senate last year
supported a bill that would ban unregulated and unlimited donations
to political parties, the Republican congressional leadership put
up an array of procedural hurdles to try to stop passage of the
legislation. The bill died when its supporters in the Senate fell
eight votes short of the 60 needed to cut off a filibuster and
bring the bill to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   With fund-raising for the 2000 presidential and congressional
races already under way, the sponsors of the legislation want a
House vote by the summer in order to put pressure on the Senate.
With Republicans holding a narrow majority in the House, the small
group that met with the speaker Wednesday could force an early vote
by joining with Democrats on a petition. So far they have avoided
such a step, but several Republicans said they noted the
possibility in their meeting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made it very clear that September is too late,'' Rep. Marge
Roukema of New Jersey said after the meeting. She and others said
Hastert said he would consider their request.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what would happen if Hastert, R-Ill., does not move up the
timetable, she said flatly, ``Then we'd have a large problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Chris Shays of Connecticut, who is the principle Republican
sponsor of the bipartisan bill, refused to comment. The Democratic
sponsor is Rep. Martin Meehan of Massacusetts.
</P>
<P>
   After the session, Hastert released a written statement
promising a vote on campaign finance legislation by September _
which an aide said meant no later than the end of September.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker also said, ``I have serious concerns about certain
definitions of reform that unduly regulate free speech and that
unfairly discriminate against certain political parties.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans traditionally raise more money. They also object
to the bill because of its efforts to rein in the ability of
independent groups to run advertisements attacking or endorsing
candidates in the period before elections. They have wanted instead
to limit the ability of labor _ a big backer of Democrats _ to put
large sums of money into campaign efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert's position has put the Republican moderates in the
difficult position of deciding how far they will go in challenging
their new speaker in a year in which the narrow balance of power in
the House has led Republicans to put a premium on staying united.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats last month began their own effort to force the
campaign finance measure to the floor by signing a special petition
that can be used as a way to circumvent the House leadership. So
far the Democrats have gathered 191 signatures. They need 218 to
prevail _ and could do so if the 32 Republicans who are co-sponsors
of the Shays-Meehan bill also sign.
</P>
<P>
   None have so far and they still seemed Wednesday to be looking
for ways to avoid that step. Several did say that they had pointed
out to Hastert that they could choose to go that route. ``We did
not threaten him,'' Rep. Connie Morella, R-Md., said. ``We simply
said, you know there's an awful lot of attention paid to this
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Zach Wamp, R-Tenn., noted that Hastert had said he would
take their pleas for an earlier vote into consideration and get
back to them. ``He didn't rule it in. He didn't rule it out,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wamp said the group did not give the speaker a deadline for a
decision. ``Let's not tie him down and beat him up,'' he said.
``Let's give him a few days.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the allies of the Republican backers of the overhaul
legislation were growing impatient. Meehan, the bill's chief
Democratic sponsor, said, ``The majority of them want to give the
speaker the benefit of the doubt. The doubt at this time is
beginning to far outweigh the benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Meehan said that if Hastert did not budge on his timetable,
Democrats could begin taking ``drastic actions'' and use
parliamentary tactics to tie the House in knots.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a public policy
group supporting the Shay-Meehan bill, said, ``Speaker Hastert
wants the moderate Republicans to be co-conspirators in killing
their own campaign finance reform legislation.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As the group of Republicans pressed Wednesday for a vote, the
House subcommittee on the constitution heard conflicting testimony
on whether such legislation violates constitutional guarantees of
free speech.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the odd coalition that has arisen in opposition to
the campaign legislation, representatives from both the American
Civil Liberties Union and the conservative Cato Institute spoke out
against key elements of the Shays-Meehan bill.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Murphy, director of the ACLU's Washington office, said in
her written testimony that the measure would have a ``chilling
affect'' on the kinds of speech by advocacy groups ``that is
essential in a democracy.''

 &HT;    Business Week looks at Milken's attempt to rebuild his
reputation
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Michael Milken's name will be linked forever with Wall
Street scandal, especially the insider trading fiasco of the 1980s
that sent dozens of people _ including Milken _ to jail.
</P>
<P>
   With that behind him, the man who invented the junk bond market
has for the last six years ``used every waking moment to rebuild
his life and reputation,'' Business Week (May 10) reports in its
cover story.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he has outlived doctors' predictions that he
would die of cancer, which is why he is pouring copious amounts of
time and money into finding a cure for prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he has launched a new business, Knowledge
Enterprises, which offers educational services to corporations.
</P>
<P>
   CEOs at warp speed
</P>
<P>
   Fortune (May 24) attempts to answer the question, ``What kind of
person thrives as CEO of an e-corporation?''
</P>
<P>
   They are the heads of companies such as Dell Computer,
Amazon.com, Cisco Systems and Yahoo!.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new breed of CEO ... operates at warp speed and suffers
from ... `bandwidth-separation anxiety' _ they get crazy when
deprived of high-speed connection to the rest of the planet via
cell phone, two-way pager, or e-mail. E-business is business in
real time, where nothing can wait until tomorrow or even after
lunch,'' Fortune says.
</P>
<P>
   The downside is that, since the Internet lowers barriers to
entry, ``it amplifies weaknesses,'' Fortune adds.
</P>
<P>
   Strength is weakness
</P>
<P>
   Fast Company (May) warns fast-trackers to be careful: ``It's not
your weaknesses that can trip you up on your way to the top _ it's
your strengths.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing research by the Center for Creative Leadership in
Greensboro, N.C., the magazine says talented people fail to reach
the top for several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   They resist change and won't adapt during transitions; they are
difficult to work with, and often seem to be insensitive,
manipulative and overly critical; and fail to lead in a
``team-centered way.'' Since work is a social activity, Fast
Company offers advice to talented people. Among the gems of wisdom:
Drop into someone's office for a 10-minute talk at least once a
day; when people talk to you, listen; when you need help, ask for
it; start conversations with small talk; do favors for others.

GREAT PAINS TAKEN NOT TO RESURRECT THE OLD ZOMBIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use Friday, May 7 by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARLA MATZER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When the average viewer sees ``The Mummy,'' the
horror classic remake being released today, he may not appreciate
the amount and difficulty of the special effects involved. That's
just the way the filmmakers want it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hate it more than anybody when the critics write, `The
effects stole the show _ if only the story were as good,''' says
John Berton of George Lucas-owned Industrial Light and Magic, who
was the visual effects supervisor on the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always aimed at ILM to be a completely integrated part
of the movie, which just supports the story and the characters,''
Berton says.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Stephen Sommers agrees wholeheartedly. ``Studio
executives always say, `Kids love effects, let's spend a lot of
money to get more special effects,' '' says the director, whose
previous credits include ``Deep Rising'' and ``Rudyard Kipling's
The Jungle Book.'' ``But I hope that in this movie, we've really
tried to keep the story and the characters going in the forefront.
The effects should really be in the service of the story.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, without computer wizardry, ``The Mummy'' would have
been a much different movie. As it is, the movie is a complete
overhaul of the original 1932 film starring Boris Karloff. The
basic story is the same _ mummy wakes up after 3,000 years, tries
to get girl and kill people _ but this film is able to conjure up a
whole new cast of otherworldly ghouls that can change form at the
stroke of a computer key.
</P>
<P>
   The real and computer worlds are so intertwined that the Mummy
himself is a combination of digital effects and actor Arnold
Vosloo. Many scenes feature effects that are impressively realistic
but would have been impossible without computer-generated images
(CGI): beetles crawling under the skin of hapless victims, swarms
of bugs flying through the air or chasing people down dark
hallways, sand rising and shifting into the form of an enormous
human face.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Snow of ILM, who served as computer graphics supervisor on
the film, says the ``particle systems'' used in creating swarms of
bugs and sand formations is an example of the cutting-edge
techniques employed in the film. ``In the case of the insects,''
Snow said in an interview from ILM's San Rafael headquarters,
``each has to be a detailed little model that has to be animated.
Thousands have to be animated; the first problem is to choreograph
the motion.''
</P>
<P>
   This is done through particle systems. That is, in the computer,
ILM artists start with a representation of the space that their
creation has to occupy on-screen. One tiny dot represents each
object (grain of sand, bug), that has to be animated to avoid or
interact with the other dots/objects.
</P>
<P>
   This is how the shape-shifting sand scenes were done. In order
to emulate real sand, which is composed of billions of individual
grains, multiple points had to be animated, rather than a single
mass. Particle systems direct the movement of these thousands of
points in concert with each other.
</P>
<P>
   The Mummy character also presented challenges _ first of all, in
its design. ``We knew it couldn't look like a guy in a mummy
suit,'' says Sommers, ``a guy wrapped in bandages, that you could
outrun.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as Sommers says, ``what would a 3,000-year-old corpse look
like?'' The result is part skeleton, part Terminator. As the
creature regenerates by taking over the body parts of hapless
humans, ILM had to animate the look of skin moving over a muscle,
another envelope-pushing effect.
</P>
<P>
   As Vosloo's image becomes meshed with the computer-generated
mummy, there are several layers of effects at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We built a physical model, which is then `sculpted' into a 3-D
image in the computer,'' explains Snow. ``It's then connected by
little lines, which look like chicken wire. Each of these connected
points can then be moved around in relation to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Onto this model was added data from ``motion capture'' animation
of Vosloo. On a set in England, Vosloo put on a ``suit'' of
reflective-ball sensors and played out the scenes his character has
in the movie. This data went into the computer, and was mixed with
the CGI animation to give it a more realistic feel. This can save
some animation time, and make a character appear to be in the same
space as the real actors on screen.
</P>
<P>
   After the motion capture and CGI animation was combined, ILM
artists still had to add detail to make the character look
believable.
</P>
<P>
   ``An animator comes in and adds facial motions, lip-syncing. You
sometimes play around with the timing, to make it fit in the
scene,'' explains Snow. ``Then we apply the stuff that makes it
look real: Painters add surface material that makes it blend with
the scene and not look like a computer image.''
</P>
<P>
   Sommers says probably the most complicated scene was a battle
scene near the end of the movie, where multiple CGI mummies battle
with real characters. Berton, who was on the set with Sommers every
day of filming, points out that that scene required the entire
arsenal of effects tricks: real actors went through the motions of
the mummies on the set, then duplicated their moves exactly in a
studio wearing motion capture equipment. Their images, along with
CGI ones, then replaced the real actors in the finished film.
Detail was painted in to the finished scene.
</P>
<P>
   Though Sommers and his ILM team hope the overall effect is
seamless, the effects have become a key element in ``The Mummy's''
marketing campaign. Early on, the studio considered keeping the
mummy's look secret, a la Sony's strategy for ``Godzilla'' last
year. But the mummy and other key CGI elements are now featured
prominently in movie trailers and TV ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marketing people felt very strongly that we had to let
people know that this isn't just a guy wrapped in bandages,'' says
Sommers. ``We wanted to tell people, `This isn't your Daddy's
Mummy.' ''

QUINN BROTHERS CONNECT ON GENERATIONAL DRAMA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use  May 7  by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 3 STARS 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A sweet, sad Irish period love story with some
modern-day resonance, ``This Is My Father'' comes by its familial
themes the honest way. Aidan Quinn stars and acts as executive
producer along with brothers Paul and Declan. Paul wrote and
directed the film and Declan contributed his formidable visual
storytelling skills as director of photography. The brothers' tight
teamwork coalesces into a single vision of strength and purpose.
</P>
<P>
   The film opens in a present-day high school classroom in Aurora,
Ill. A disillusioned teacher, Kieran Johnson (James Caan), is going
through the motions, unable to relate to his students and escape
the sorrow caused by the death of his wife. Kieran's mother, Fiona
(Francoise Graton), recently had a stroke and lives (in complete
silence) with his divorced sister, Betty (Susan Almgren), and her
rebellious teen-age son, Jack (Jacob Tierney).
</P>
<P>
   Kieran never knew his father and is intrigued when he finds an
old photo of a young Fiona locked arm in arm with a farmer, along
with a book of poems inscribed with the name ``Kieran.'' Realizing
he has hit an emotional dead end in his life, Kieran decides to go
to Ireland to learn the story of his family. At the behest of
Betty, he takes Jack with him.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving in the rural town of his mother's Irish youth, Kieran
meets an old woman who knows the story of the mysterious photo. At
this point, the film shifts back to 1939 where the free-spirited,
young Fiona (Moya Farrelly) defies her widow mother (Gina Moxley)
and takes up with a shy, poor farmer, Kieran O'Day (Quinn).
</P>
<P>
   The two fall deeply in love but the relationship is complicated
by two things: the mother's pettiness and interference from the
local Catholic parish. This is a church-run town and whenever
someone steps out of line, the priest heaps on the guilt until it
buries the person into submission. Faced with that unforgiving
climate, Fiona and Kieran must decide how badly they want to be
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Is My Father'' marks the feature debut from
writer-director Quinn and he displays a sharp understanding for
rural Irish life. The details _ the language, the scenery, the
poverty _ have been revealed in a manner that eschews lyricism in
favor of straightforward storytelling. (Think Maeve Binchy, not
James Joyce.) And that's fine. Poetic emotion is tough to capture
on the screen _ another recent Irish movie, ``Dancing at
Lughnasa,'' proved that.
</P>
<P>
   What elevates the film is the acting. In addition to the main
players, the supporting cast also includes memorable, brief turns
from John Cusack as an exuberant Life magazine photographer and
Stephen Rea playing a monstrously funny Catholic priest who chases
parishioners out of the confessional, screaming, ``Don't even think
about coming back to this church until you stop doing that!''
</P>
<P>
   The present-day characters aren't on screen all that long and
have to make the most of their brief payoff scenes. Although his
character is a little sketchy, Caan manages to convey the sense of
completion Kieran achieves in Ireland and delivers a heartbreaking
moment near the film's conclusion. It's his best role in years.
</P>
<P>
   The film's leisurely pace affords plenty of opportunities to
show off Ireland's spare, rural beauty. And as most of the locales
haven't changed in 60 years, the settings are perfectly suited for
this tale of one generation coming to grips with the actions of
another. &QL;

HITLER GETS IN TOUCH WITH HIS CONSCIENCE IN BUNKER FANTASY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use  May 7  by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 1 star 
By MARLA MATZER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Put Adolf Hitler, Eva Braun, Hermann Goering and
Joseph Goebbels together in a bunker after World War II with
Sigmund Freud and you're in for a claustrophobic character study of
evil. ``The Empty Mirror,'' an independent film being distributed
by Lions Gate Films, could be called ``Hitler in Hell''; though it
purports to ``reimagine'' the demons and aspirations that drove
Hitler, it's ultimately more of a revenge fantasy about the
monstrous dictator having to live with himself and contemplate his
deeds into old age.
</P>
<P>
   The story has Hitler and his closest confidantes living in the
bunker where they retreated as the Allies closed in on Berlin in
1945. There, they are condemned to contemplate their acts in a
limbo ``detached from historical time,'' according to the movie's
press materials.
</P>
<P>
   The film often seems like a stage play on which a camera was
turned. Norman Rodway as Hitler delivers a number of monologues in
which he comments on actual newsreel footage playing in the
background. Though the real footage is probably the most
interesting part of the movie, the device makes for a clumsily
paced film.
</P>
<P>
   That's true, too, of the expository dialogue that characters Eva
Braun (Camilla Soeberg), Hermann Goering (Glenn Shadix) and Joseph
Goebbels (Joel Grey) recite in order to spur comment from the
Fuehrer about things he did in his infamous career. In a couple of
scenes, one almost expects Hitler to break out into a little soft
shoe while recounting his evil deeds, a la Applegate in ``Damn
Yankees'' (``Those were the good old days...'').
</P>
<P>
   The story, and these actors, might have worked well on stage.
But on film, the effect is entirely too stagey. Grey plays Goebbels
with an over-the-top, limping weasely-ness; Rodway as Hitler struts
and poses in his full dress uniforms as if they were so much
steel-toed drag.
</P>
<P>
   Sigmund Freud (Peter Michael Goetz) has apparently been thrown
into the mix to induce further psychological reflection on the part
of Hitler. The biggest problem with the whole affair is buying into
the premise that, left alone with his thoughts, Hitler would have
had any regrets other than losing the war. Anyone who studies
history knows that top Nazi criminals such as Adolf Eichmann
remained unrepentant to the end, or else fled or killed themselves
to avoid any such consequence altogether. This conceit, therefore,
strikes a false chord. &QL;

A CHANCE TO BREAK THE POP STRANGLEHOLD  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 9) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are two great pop music dreams. And they usually follow
each other, like marriage and divorce. The first great dream is to
get together with friends in a basement or garage, write songs,
make music, feel the magic and perform at local clubs until a big
record label rushes in waving a contract.
</P>
<P>
   And then the label takes care of the rest: hit singles, arena
shows, limos, parties, a new house for mom. But the dream, even for
those few who actually get to live it, has usually been a
nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the next great dream kicks in. This is the dream of
independence, of breaking away from the record label and going it
alone. It's about rethinking the first dream, remembering that the
most exciting part of being in a band was when you did it yourself.
There was the joy of selling the first three copies of a CD or
cassette you made on your own. Back then, you actually made a few
bucks off those sales.
</P>
<P>
   Now, under a record label, promotional costs are so high that
you may see no actual money, even if you're lucky enough to sell a
million albums. And then there are the long tours spanning four
continents, the executives that keep sending you back into the
studio asking for hits despite the fact that you considered your
album finished months ago, and the three-year gap between the
release of each record. Signing to a big label suddenly doesn't
seem like a step up anymore; it seems like a sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no contract you can sign in modern life that resembles
a recording contract; they're absolutely unconscionable,'' said
Bart Bull, the manager and husband of Michelle Shocked, the
singer-songwriter who spent four years extricating herself from her
contract with Mercury Records after the label rejected her new
songs for being inconsistent with her style.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take those 48 pages of a typical contract and hold it in
front of anyone familiar with other types of business contracts,
and they think it's insane.''
</P>
<P>
   A slew of recent events _ from the panic at major labels over
the distribution of music on the Internet to the bloodletting
following large music company mergers _ has made it clear to
musicians that the structure of major record companies is not
conducive to either their financial or, more important, their
artistic goals.
</P>
<P>
   Talking to everyone from up-and-coming bands to those who have
been signed for more than a decade, from artists with low sales to
superstars, from lawyers to former executives, there is a growing
dissatisfaction with a system that has been building its fortress
for more than 100 years _ since a company called Columbia sprung up
to challenge Thomas Edison's exclusive distribution of prerecorded
cylinders to be played on the phonograph he invented.
</P>
<P>
   This dissatisfaction stems less from the fact that the companies
are owned by multinational conglomerates than from the belief that
the labels are simply too big, numbers-driven and inefficient.
Artists who could be much farther along in their creative work get
bogged down in the bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting for the new record from Perry Farrell of Jane's
Addiction? Keep waiting. It's already been rejected by his record
label, Warner Brothers, several times. And what ever happened to
Joan Osborne? Her label hasn't liked her new material either.
</P>
<P>
   The Verve Pipe? The label made the band write dozens of
additional songs for its next album in search of a new hit. And
Beck? He has just been sued by his record label over a contract
dispute. And this is how the labels treat their favored artists.
</P>
<P>
   Today, we are at an important moment in music history. Thanks in
part to the rise of the Internet and music-business consolidation,
a window has opened, one in which making this sacrifice of artistic
freedom for commercial success may no longer be necessary. In the
next few years, either a lot of best-selling musicians are going to
climb through that window or the window is going to slam shut,
tighter than it ever was before.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at the music industry today. Manufactured
teeny-bopper bands are dominating the pop world, corporate mergers
are squeezing hundreds of musicians out of the business without
even giving them the rights to their recordings, and executives of
major record labels are meeting behind closed doors to develop a
way to police and control the distribution of music on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   These events are pointing the way to an exit from the status quo
by fostering dissent and inadvertently giving musicians the freedom
to act on it. In recent years, several people have stepped up to
try to make the business work better for musicians and their fans,
among them the musician, computer whiz and virtual-reality pioneer
Jaron Lanier and the progressive rock guitarist Robert Fripp of
King Crimson. They are developing new companies in hopes of
chipping away at a business that loses money on far more records
than it profits from.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rhetoric on the Internet about an online music
revolution bringing down the record establishment, it is not the
Internet per se that is going to grant musicians their freedom.
It's the idea of the Internet _ in other words, the knowledge that
there is an alternative to the system.
</P>
<P>
   The golden age of the Internet _ as a freewheeling, chaotic
world where all information is available free of charge and
everybody is equal _ is fast coming to an end. There's too much
money at stake for it not to be transformed into a new revenue
stream for corporations. Look at the record labels. It may seem as
if they are running scared because recent technological advances
have made it very easy for Internet users to copy and distribute
their favorite CDs on line without authorization, but the truth is
that the labels have already found a way to turn this new
technology to their financial advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Most major labels have added what's called a new technology
deduction clause to the contracts they offer bands. What it does is
subtract 15 percent to 25 percent of the royalty rate of 12 percent
to 13 percent that a new band receives for each record sold.
</P>
<P>
   The labels maintain that the clause is necessary because of the
costs of Internet-related technology. This rationale seems strange
because the distribution of music on the Internet is supposed to
save record labels money in CD manufacturing, packaging and
shipping costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the lawyers with the most power can't get rid of those
clauses,'' said Ken Freundlich, a top music-industry lawyer. ``It's
the same mind-set the labels have had since the CD: bring on the
new technology, cut the royalty rate.''

 &HT;    Hearing set for suit against Coke
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A federal court judge in Atlanta has set an expedited
hearing for May 13 in the racial discrimination suit against
Coca-Cola Co.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Richard Story granted the plaintiffs'
emergency request for the hearing to determine if Coca-Cola chief
M. Douglas Ivester violated a court rule when he sent e-mail
messages to salaried black employees about the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys representing the plaintiffs _ four current and former
African-American employees _ contend Ivester violated a rule that
prevents communication with potential members of a class-action
suit without court approval. The plaintiffs seek class-action
status, so 1,500 salaried black employees can be included in the
suit alleging discrimination in pay, promotions, performance
evaluations and terminations.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola has said the motion is a typical legal maneuver with
no validity. The judge ordered the company to file its response by
Tuesday.

 UNDATED: royalty rate.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The head of a record company, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said he wasn't worried about artists releasing their CDs
independently on the Internet. ``How are they going to compete with
someone putting $10 million into another Web site?'' he asked. ``Do
you know how big the Internet's going to be? You're going to need
infrastructure.''
</P>
<P>
   Putting control of the Internet in the hands of the corporations
means that a utopian musical vision may be dying. The vision is of
a level playing field where all bands regardless of their record
label or financing have equal access to the ears of the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the chances of a dystopian world are increasing, one in
which record companies have even greater control over music
distribution, and new bands are signed not because of how they
sound but because of how many visitors come to their Internet site
each month.
</P>
<P>
   At present, record companies have a great deal of control. A
record deal is basically a service contract that puts the musician
in the employ of the record company. In all but the rarest cases,
by signing a deal musicians forfeit their ownership of any music
they make under that contract. And, from the outset, the musician
is put in a position of accepting debt.
</P>
<P>
   That tantalizing million dollar advance, for example, must be
paid back to the record label at an interest rate far higher than
that of a bank loan. Because the debt is paid out of the small
royalty that musicians make, most acts never see a penny from their
record sales. The record company executive said: ``A lot of lawyers
and artists don't understand how the record business works. Artists
don't have $50 million in overhead. We don't make money on their
T-shirts and concerts that we market and promote.''
</P>
<P>
   For the music fan, far more disturbing than the financial toll
record labels exact from artists is the creative one. Except in the
case of an extremely slow, laborious songwriter like Leonard Cohen,
artistic creativity moves at a much faster rate than the current
system allows.
</P>
<P>
   Even in hip-hop, in which musicians tend to turn around albums
quickly to take advantage of shortterm trends, there is frustration
over inertia on the part of the record labels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago, there was a 9- or 10-day turnaround after an artist
turned in a record; now it takes 9 to 10 months because the record
labels can't handle the traffic and need a year to set up their
marketing and promotion systems,'' said Chuck D of Public Enemy, a
pioneering rap group that left a major label in January and will
release its next record through an Internet company called Atomic
Pop.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the majors cannot adapt to change, they become solely
banking systems. If they could sell Brillo pads with a slice of
cheese on them, they'd do that, because the music is irrelevant to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many musicians who probably belong in the major label
system, particularly those using music as a route to money and fame
or those who see their calling not in artistic achievement but in
mass entertainment. Then there are songwriters like Aimee Mann, the
former singer in 'Til Tuesday, who has a strong fan base and is an
accomplished songwriter. But her experiences trying to release
records have been soul-crushing, and as a result she has only put
out two albums in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Her first label, Giant, got cold feet and canceled her contract
before releasing her first album. Her second label, Imago, folded
before her second record came out, and, just after Ms. Mann
completed her third album for her third label, Geffen, the company
was consolidated into Interscope as a result of the merger of both
labels' parent company, Universal Music, with Polygram.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mann thought she had finally caught a lucky break when she
became one of the few artists whose contracts were not dropped in
the merger. But soon after, she was told that Interscope _ her
fourth label _ wanted her to continue working on an album.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm officially at the end of my major label rope,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Labels have built their business on hits. If they had developed
a model that could profit from a record that sold 200,000 copies,
the way many independent labels do, they could have made money by
putting out the five or so records that Ms. Mann _ or the scores of
other performers in similar situations _ might have released.
</P>
<P>
   This mishandling doesn't just happen with serious artists.
Another merger casualty was the English teeny-bopper band Boyzone,
which suffered a setback in its chance for success in America when,
to meet a quarterly quota, its label, Mercury, quietly released
30,000 copies of its album before the merger instead of waiting to
set up the record properly.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Mercury said that the record had been released
to get ``a running start'' for the band's promotional campaign this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that labels judge with weekly sales reports
and not their ears, giving up on a band that doesn't do well in the
short term but may generate future catalog sales. History has
proved over and over that one decade's failures (whether it's the
Velvet Underground's proto-punk or Joni Mitchell's redirection into
jazz) can become the next decade's classics.
</P>
<P>
   But the history of the music business is one of inefficiencies,
dating back to the late 19th century, when less than half the sheet
music released paid back the high cost of marketing the music,
despite the tactic of paying well-known performers to include the
song in their repertories.
</P>
<P>
   ``For an artist like me, who is somewhere in the middle
saleswise, I've maybe had a couple of records that once made the
record company money,'' said David Lowery, formerly of Camper Van
Beethoven and now in Cracker on Virgin Records. ``But now, I doubt
a gold record could make them money anymore. They need a
platinum.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is one more story, a common tale with a new twist: Josh
Clayton-Felt, formerly of the rock group School of Fish, spent
three years working on his second solo album for A&AMP;M Records. Every
time he thought he was finished, label executives sent him back
into the studio with the four words that have become anathema to
working musicians, ``It needs a hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Clayton-Felt turned in a total of 22 songs, then waited for
executives to set a release date for the record. But after eight
months, A&AMP;M was taken over by Interscope. Clayton-Felt was one of
some 250 artist dropped after the Universal merger.
</P>
<P>
   A free agent, Clayton-Felt asked if he could release the music
he had recorded during that time elsewhere: the label said no. He
asked if he could buy it back and release it himself, and again the
answer was no. Label executives said they would negotiate only with
a major label.

 UNDATED: major label.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So he decided he would rent a studio and record new versions of
the songs. But Universal still said no: a clause in his contract
prevented his rerecording the songs for five years.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Bernstein, a spokesman for Universal, said that Clayton-Felt
had been told that his album could either be released independently
for a limited term or shopped to a major label. ``If he garnered
interest from a major, Universal would be willing to negotiate a
sale of that record,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For four months, Clayton-Felt wrestled with the label and with
himself. ``I started to look at why it has gotten to this point,
that record labels have so much power,'' he said. ``And the reason
is because artists have given them far too much control. We need to
start looking out for each other. But we so badly want a piece of
the pie that we've knocked each other down in the process of
pursuing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clayton-Felt considered changing his name to record the songs or
performing them in a concert that his audience was encouraged to
bootleg. Finally, he realized that there could be as many as 100
artists in similar situations because of the merger. And, legally,
he could bring together a dozen or so of them and record an album
on which musicians take their best songs stuck in the Universal
machine and give them to another performer to record.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Clayton-Felt is working on the compilation and hoping
to use the proceeds to start an artist-run cooperative label.
</P>
<P>
   ``God, I never thought I'd say these things,'' he said after
explaining his plan. But Clayton-Felt is only echoing sentiments
held by Chuck D, Ms. Mann, Ms. Brooke, Lanier, Fripp and Lowery.
What is more surprising is that a large number of popular musicians
_ even lawyers and label executives _ are agreeing with them. No
one wants to give the system another chance. The idea of the
Internet, the alternative, is much more tempting.
</P>
<P>
   There are three things musicians want from a major label: money
for recording and touring, national marketing muscle and wide
distribution. If another system could be developed that offered
musicians this trinity, then perhaps when their contracts expired
they would think twice about remaining with major labels.
</P>
<P>
   Especially considering that when asked, many artists said they
would rather sell 200,000 copies of 10 records each than 7 million
of 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we didn't have a record deal, I would explore manufacturing
the records ourselves,'' Lowery said. ``I'd make an arrangement
with an independent distributor, maybe hire some Internet marketing
firms, make deals with MP3 sites and run the business more like a
software company. I would like to see if doing it that way is going
to afford us more creative control and make us more money and get
our music to the people we think would like us.''
</P>
<P>
   (By MP3, Lowery is referring to a popular technology that
enables music to be converted into relatively small, high-quality
computer files that can be easily distributed on line.)
</P>
<P>
   As for alternatives, there are a few different possibilities.
The first is simply doing the work yourself. Lately, being on their
own label has paid off for musicians like Ms. Brooke, Kristin
Hersh, Jane Siberry, Ani DiFranco and, most popular and
dramatically of all, the artist formerly known as Prince.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did he sport the word slave on his cheek while under
contract to Warner Brothers, but he also announced that he would be
rerecording all 17 of his records for the label to spite it for not
giving back his master tapes when he was released from his contract
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a downside to independence. Just as it is
unfortunate for artists to waste away creatively while waiting for
a record label to put out their music out, it's also a shame when
they spend more time doing business than making music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm swamped with the business side of things,'' said Ms.
Brooke, whose independent record has sold more copies than her
major-label ones did. ``So it's very hard to put on the other hat,
close the door and start banging on my piano again when I feel like
I should be calling up the indie promoters and publicists working
the record.''
</P>
<P>
   Another alternative is a holdover from the 70s: setting up a
label based on a set of artist-friendly principles and trying to
get other musicians to join the collective struggle. In 1991,
Fripp, the British guitarist, formed a company called Discipline
Global Music. There is little chance that it will even cause a blip
on the radar of the current music business, but its ideas could
inspire a related movement that will.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any culture whose artists are directed or controlled by
commercial interests is in mortal danger,'' Fripp begins one
section of his company's manifesto, going on to declare: ``Any
record company who asks an artist, `You want to sell records, don't
you?' should be avoided. Any A&AMP;R man who tells the artist to record
a single because their album can't be promoted without one has just
told the artist to change labels.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's a third, more ambitious alternative: to devise an
entirely new way of doing business. That is exactly what Lanier is
doing. Recently, he drew up a five-point strategy, formed a
musicians' collective called Musicisum with Kristen Stavola and
signed up more than 45 artists to begin a noble experiment that
involves the Internet, subscription fees and music filling
stations.
</P>
<P>
   The plan provides that giving artists equity in the companies
that market their work would motivate them. They would receive
dividends, a much larger share of royalties, the rights to their
master recordings and short, standardized contracts so that
everyone would be aware of the risks and rewards in the deal.
</P>
<P>
   On a more radical note, the proposal suggests that successful
musicians be asked to take a stake in new acts to help them get
started. In turn, so-called music pirates would be encouraged to
become mini-retailers instead and sell CDs and concert tickets on
their own Web sites for a small profit. ``The hacker kids are the
indie retailers of the future,'' said Ms. Stavola.
</P>
<P>
   Lanier, cautiously optimistic, predicted: ``If we do it and get
crushed like bugs, we'll still have shifted what the business does
so it will be better for fans and artists. At least they will be
educated. But I don't think we will get squashed. There will just
be a variety of different businesses in place _ the supertankers
and ours, which will have the best music.''
</P>
<P>
   There are several other schemes similar to Lanier's that have
been suggested. What they all involve is finding a way for
musicians to finance the release and marketing of their albums that
does not involve their signing away their rights.
</P>
<P>
   In such proposals, it is the artists who hire the companies that
promote, publicize and distribute their music. This way if any
company isn't doing its job, it can be dismissed without serious
consequences. And it is the Internet that serves to market _ and
help distribute _ an artist's music by building up a network of
dedicated fans not unlike the way the Grateful Dead did in the real
world.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the best of the plans don't rely entirely on the
Internet, since its capabilities to distribute music lie in the
future and a large portion of music sales will take place outside
the home for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   The main problem with most such approaches is capital: where
does the start-up money for groups to record and promote their
music come from? The solution requires building better banks:
Lanier suggests having ``musician-friendly entities'' or more
successful artists serving as guarantors on a loan for start-up
bands.

 UNDATED: up bands.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Others suggest having financiers invest in a band in exchange
for a percentage of the royalties but no other involvement, though
this could create a new set of business problems.
</P>
<P>
   As anyone who's studied European revolutions knows, the
revolution often becomes as tyrannical as the establishment it
overthrows. Or, as the Who once sang, ``Meet the new boss, same as
the old boss.''
</P>
<P>
   Public Enemy's Internet deal with Atomic Pop may be
revolutionary because it will result in the first new album by a
major artist available for direct download on the Internet before
it is in stores. But look who is running Atomic Pop: Al Teller, the
former head of two major labels, MCA and Columbia, for which Public
Enemy recorded its first albums. Of course, the problem in the
business is not necessarily the people in charge; it's the system
they're entrenched in.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-major-label sentiment expressed by Lanier, Fripp and
others is nothing new in pop music. It is actually what drives the
business. Periodically, popular music veers into a period of
stagnation and major labels shut their doors to new talent and
innovation. Those shut out develop their own voice, usually through
independent labels.
</P>
<P>
   This happened in the mid-50s with rock-and-roll, what's now
called classic rock in the late '60s, punk rock in the late '70s,
alternative rock in the late '80s and gangsta rap in the mid-'90s.
And maybe it is happening again.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the next step is that once the major labels see the
success of outsiders, they embrace them and bring them into the
system. The result is that the alternative becomes the mainstream,
demoted from rebellion to trend. It is then diluted with
successively cheaper imitations until the myopic gatekeepers slam
the doors shut again, allowing the next band of renegades to gather
their forces as the labels once more focus their resources on the
superstars. This means that today we stand at the threshold of a
revolution or a repetition.

   RAMSTEIN, Germany _ As President Clinton met Wednesday with
three American POWs recently released by the Serbs, Defense
Secretary William Cohen said he was inclined to recommend the
release of two Yugoslav soldiers now held by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But Cohen, who accompanied Clinton on a whirlwind trip to two
U.S. air bases in Germany and to NATO headquarters in Brussels,
Belgium, said any such release would not be in response to Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic's decision to free the U.S. soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a goodwill overture to Mr. Milosevic,'' Cohen
said. ``I don't believe Mr. Milosevic has made any goodwill
overture toward us.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said the soldiers would be released ``consistent with
traditional standards'' _ but he did not spell out what those
standards are.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav soldiers were captured in separate incidents last
month by the Kosovo Liberation Army and turned over to the Albanian
government. The Albanians turned the prisoners over to U.S. forces.
</P>
<P>
   Both soldiers are being held in Germany, Pentagon spokesman Ken
Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said NATO intends to step up its bombing campaign against
Yugoslavia regardless of whether the Serb soldiers are released.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to continue,'' he said. ``It will not impede our
intensification of the air campaign. We're going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   But the president also was faced with vivid reminders of the
risks of prolonged military involvement. An Apache helicopter on a
training mission in Albania crashed, killing its two pilots. It was
the second of these low-flying combat helicopters to crash before
they have engaged in military action.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton referred to the pilots, the first U.S. fatalities in the
Kosovo conflict, in an address to soldiers and their families at
Spangdahlem Air Base in southwestern Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I have tried to make sure the American people
understand in the years I have been president is that your jobs
have inherent dangers, even when not directly engaged in
conflict,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In another reminder of the hazards of war, Clinton met with the
three former American prisoners of war and separately with each of
their families. The soldiers are being housed at Ramstein Air Base
while they undergo evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   The president, who had donned an airplane bomber jacket for the
Ramstein visit, posed for pictures with three soldiers and their
families at the base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of them,'' Clinton told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The three men _ Spc. Steven Gonzales, 22, of Huntsville, Texas;
Staff. Sgt. Andrew Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles and Staff. Sgt.
Christopher Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich. _ were captured March
31 while on a routine reconnaissance mission near the Macedonian
border with Kosovo. The Rev. Jesse Jackson negotiated their release
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Stone did most of the talking in the presidential meeting, White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just glad to be free,'' Stone told the president.
</P>
<P>
   The president's trip was clearly intended to boost the morale of
U.S. soldiers stationed at bases here that supply personnel and
equipment for the military engagement in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to soldiers at Spangdahlem in a hangar surrounded by
F-16 aircraft, Clinton stressed that the Americans were fighting
Milosevic now to avoid another protracted European conflict in this
century.
</P>
<P>
   ``This base was built in the aftermath of the Second World War
at the dawn of the Cold War,'' Clinton said to an enthusiastic,
flag-waving welcome. ``Because of allied vigilance, the war we then
feared would occur never happened. Now planes are actually flying
into combat from this base for the very first time, to protect the
future your forebearers worked so hard to build.''

TRADITIONAL FAMILY TV SITCOM MAY BE A DYING BREED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: This story, sent and held last night, is now released for
publication.)  (bl) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Seinfeld'' was often called the prototype of the
post-modern sitcom, and so it seemed apt that the last episode
involved a strange dream sequence and a sinister finale for a group
of self-absorbed singles stumbling in an amoral world.
</P>
<P>
   Now compare that with the recent taping of the final episode of
``Home Improvement,'' a prime-time hit on ABC for the past eight
seasons. After the tearful star, Tim Allen, told a joke for a cast
and crew drenched in tears, they taped a slightly maudlin story,
scheduled to air May 25, in which Allen's character reaffirms his
love for his wife and family, and his loyal sidekick finds the love
that had long eluded him, lending the closing a poignant moral
gravity.
</P>
<P>
   The episode was touching and, many people in television believe,
a historical relic, as the traditional family sitcom _ a staple of
the medium for more than four decades _ goes the way of the
western.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that show was pitched to a network today, nobody would take
it,'' lamented Matt Williams, one of the creators and an executive
producer of ``Home Improvement'' and previously a producer of
another traditional family sitcom, ``The Cosby Show.'' ``This show
was created to celebrate the American family, and I'm not sure you
can do that in the same way now.''
</P>
<P>
   At one time domestic sitcoms like ``Father Knows Best,'' ``Leave
It to Beaver,'' ``The Dick Van Dyke Show,'' ``The Brady Bunch'' and
even ``All in the Family'' and ``Sanford and Son'' virtually
defined television while conveying powerful images of an often
idealized if somewhat quirky middle-class existence built around
family units. Households across the United States generally had a
single television, there were only three networks, and the
experience of watching such shows was shared.
</P>
<P>
   No longer. Homes frequently have many television sets; 74
percent of homes now have more than one, compared with 35 percent
in 1970. And there are scores of channels transmitting images that
have changed subtly but significantly. Singles dominate sitcoms _
shows like ``Friends,'' ``The Drew Carey Show'' or ``Ally McBeal,''
for example _ and the networks for the most part no longer even try
to attract broad audiences. Audiences are deeply divided by age and
even by race. Advertisers press the networks to pursue thin slices
of the audience _ preferably younger, affluent, white men _ and pay
dearly to reach them.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising Age, a trade publication, reports that advertisers
pay $425,000 for a 30-second spot on ``Friends,'' compared with
$210,000 for an ad on ``Home Improvement'' and just $115,000 for an
ad on ``Cosby.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most successful family sitcom still on the air is
``The Simpsons,'' Fox's animated sendup about a dysfunctional
family whose creator, Matt Groening, openly describes it as ``the
anti-Cosby show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea and delight we once took in celebrating family,
community seems to be vaporizing before us,'' said Norman Lear, the
creator of shows like ``All in the Family'' and ``The Jeffersons.''
``You now have all these shows about lone people coming together.
It seems to me this is part of something profound. It's a disease
of our time. There's a television in every room and the family has
become splintered.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the last popular domestic sitcoms is ``Everybody Loves
Raymond,'' on CBS. Phil Rosenthal, a creator and an executive
producer, said he faced enormous resistance from network executives
when he presented the idea several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, there was nothing about the premise of this show
that anybody at a network found attractive,'' Rosenthal said.
``They said it had to be edgier, hipper, not so family. But what
you have to realize is that this is a show about a family with
kids, but it is very much for an adult audience. It's not aimed at
the broad audiences. It's a new kind of family show, maybe an
evolutionary step.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there are people who believe that while the old-style
show may be dying, there is plenty of demand for new-style family
shows. ``Perhaps it won't be a traditional family sitcom, but I
think America is waiting for the next one,'' said Warren
Littlefield, a producer who was president of NBC Entertainment when
it put shows like ``Seinfeld'' and ``Friends'' on its schedule.
``The rule in television is follow the trends, then buck them.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the producers of ``Home Improvement'' have decided
to all but pull out of the medium that made them wealthy, a rarity
in the business. Indeed, the show's finale was conspicuously
elegiac for the team that created and oversaw ``Home Improvement,''
Williams, Carmen Finestra and David McFadzean, who make up the Wind
Dancer Production Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home Improvement'' was one of the great successes of the early
1990s and it may earn $1 billion by the time its years of reruns
run out, say television executives. The Wind Dancer partners are
estimated to have earned tens of millions of dollars each on the
program.
</P>
<P>
   But the trio has failed to produce another hit show, striking
out with attempts like ``Soul Man,'' ``Buddies'' and ``Costello.''
And now, with the proliferation of cable channels and the eager
effort by advertisers to attract young slices of the audience,
there seems to be less demand for the sort of program Wind Dancer
excels at.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think that, because of the competition from cable, the
networks are not looking for a show that appeals to all age levels,
the traditional family shows,'' said Finestra. ``I feel like I can
do more of what I want to be doing in a movie. We're sort of
old-fashioned in the kinds of shows we like to do and this world
has changed so much in just a few years.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ABC Entertainment chairman Stu Bloomberg said traditional family
sitcoms may still get on the air, but less frequently, and
certainly not without an unusual point of view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it is harder to put a domestic comedy on,'' Bloomberg
said. ``There were more domestic comedies in the days of single
television households and before cable.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it is still trying to develop a small number of series
ideas, Wind Dancer is now focusing on a big slate of movies and
plays. In fact, the company has commissioned plays from more than a
dozen writers _ including Rick Dresser, Daisy Foote, Heather
McDonald and Eduardo Machado _ and it is producing ``The Bubbly
Black Girl Sheds Her Chameleon Skin,'' at Playwrights Horizon in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going aggressively back into half-hour television,''
said McFadzean. ``Now we're producing movies, and I'm really
interested in the plays we're involved with.''
</P>
<P>
   To some degree Wind Dancer's problems are typical, since few
successful creators of sitcoms have second acts as vibrant as the
first. (As it happens, Castle Rock, the company that produced
``Seinfeld,'' has also failed to create a follow-up success.) And
even the elements that made ``Home Improvement'' a hit were
somewhat unique and therefore tough to duplicate.
</P>
<P>
   First and foremost, the show had Tim Allen, a popular stand-up
comedian whose visibility was growing when ``Home Improvement''
went on the air in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Allen's character, Tim Taylor, related to a
powerful thread running through popular culture at that time.
Taylor was the host of a small cable show called ``Tool Time,''
about, of course, home improvement. He was depicted as a somewhat
coarse man's man who loved power tools and grunting and had a hard
time understanding the woman in his life, his wife. His personality
tied in perfectly with the Iron John movement for men, which was
popular when the show went on the air. (It didn't hurt either that,
for the first few seasons, Pamela Anderson, wearing a tight
T-shirt, played the ``Tool Time Girl'' on the fictional home
improvement show.)
</P>
<P>
   But times have changed, taking a toll. ``Home Improvement'' was
the No. 1 rated show in the 1993-1994 season. But in the most
recent week for which there are figures, April 26 to May 2, ``Home
Improvement'' ranked 33rd, with 11.02 million viewers, according to
Nielsen Media Research. The No. 1 rated sitcom, ``Frasier,'' had
21.4 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Until two years ago, Wind Dancer had a staff of about 30 people
in its offices on the Walt Disney studio lot in Burbank, most of
them involved in developing more than a dozen television show ideas
on which the company was banking.
</P>
<P>
   The company got four new shows on the air after ``Home
Improvement.'' That is a good track record. But none of the shows
lasted.
</P>
<P>
   So more recently, Wind Dancer slashed its staff in half, to
about 15 people, and reduced the number of television projects it
was working on to three or so, two of them dramas rather than
sitcoms.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile it has commissioned plays from more than a dozen
writers and it has more than a dozen movie projects in the works.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad, but mostly liberating,'' said Finestra, who is the
co-author of a movie script titled ``Harv the Barbarian.'' ``It's
just such a different world than the one we grew up in.''

10 STATES PLAN NEW MATH CURRICULUM AND EXAMS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Wis., Ill., Ind., Md., Mass., Mich., N.H., N.C.,
Vt. , Wash. ,  N.Y., N.J., Va.)   By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Motivated by the mediocre performance of American eighth-graders
on an international math test, the governors of 10 states said
Wednesday that they would help develop a new curriculum and
rigorous exam designed to raise students' performance to the level
of foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Mathematics Achievement Partnership, which experts called an
unusual collaboration among states, comes at a time when most
states are working on or have adopted new academic standards.
</P>
<P>
   The new curriculum and test will focus on the highest levels of
eighth-grade math, like algebra and geometry, the bane of many a
student but a bellwether of future achievement in school.
</P>
<P>
   ``All kids, no matter if they are headed for higher education or
work, ought to head into high school prepared for what the rest of
the world regards as a high school sequence of mathematics,'' said
Robert B. Schwartz, president of Achieve, a not-for-profit
organization developing the instructional materials and test.
</P>
<P>
   Achieve, based in Cambridge, Mass., was formed at the 1996
National Education Summit of governors, educators and business
leaders and is co-chaired by Gov. Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin and
Louis V. Gerstner Jr., chairman and chief executive of IBM.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Wisconsin, the other participants in the math project
are Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New
Hampshire, North Carolina, Vermont and Washington. The states,
working with their legislatures, state boards of education or other
channels, would seek to incorporate the Achieve test into their
regular battery of tests in spring 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Achieve officials said they hope to attract more states as they
draft the curriculum and test, guided by an analysis of current
practices in 20 states they consider reform-minded and six
top-performing nations on the Third International Mathematics and
Science Study, known as TIMSS. That is the exam on which American
eighth-graders showed lackluster performance, placing 27th out of
40 nations in the 1995 round.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz said Achieve had asked the 20 states it studied,
including New York and New Jersey, to join the program but only 10
have confirmed. Officials in New Jersey and New York said they
declined because they are introducing new eighth-grade tests this
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts reacted favorably to the test. ``We have learned a
lot from TIMSS, in particular what students in American schools
don't seem to be doing,'' said Albert E. Beaton, a Boston College
testing expert who has worked on TIMSS.
</P>
<P>
   But others, like Gerald Bracey, an education policy analyst and
former director of testing for Virginia, were more cautious,
asserting that the program seemed redundant with several states'
efforts to improve their teaching and assessments.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to those state assessments, 36 states participate in
the federal government's National Assessment of Education Progress
exam, which covers eigth-grade math and other subjects.

THE A-TEAM FOR REPORTING HUMAN-RIGHTS ABUSES AROUND THE WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Their job is to document many of the most gruesome and
persistent abuses of societies around the world, including torture,
disappearances and summary executions. They collect information,
interview victims and weave those accounts into a pattern, usually
one that tells of flagrant deprivations of human rights.
</P>
<P>
   They are called ``special rapporteurs'' in the lexicon of the
United Nations, which offers administrative support and pays the
expenses, but not the salaries, of 36 such independent
investigators. Their primary employment is as little-known lawyers,
judges or human rights advocates, though some have served the
United Nations for years.
</P>
<P>
   The rapporteurs' names come to light about once a year, when the
U.N. Human Rights Commission, which appoints them, meets for its
six-week conference. The investigators have to report their
findings and usually, but not always, see their work validated when
the 53-nation body approves resolutions that rebuke countries for
their failures.
</P>
<P>
   Rights inspectors are specifically assigned to more than 12
nations to examine and monitor their performance. Some are
countries that have undergone cataclysms like Cambodia and Rwanda.
Others have long-term troubles like Afghanistan, Iran and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   The situations vary, but many face considerable obstacles. Iraq
has banned its rapporteur, former Dutch Foreign Minister Max van
der Stoel, since his first report, in 1992. After his latest
report, which described the government as having one of the
bleakest rights records of any leadership since World War II, Iraqi
officials dismissed van der Stoel as ``reckless and incapable'' and
accused him of ``inventing lies.''
</P>
<P>
   As the fighting in Kosovo unfolded during the commission's last
session, which recently ended, Jiri Dienstbier, the investigator
for the Balkans and a former foreign minister of Czechoslovakia,
was shut out of the Serb province. His teams were stranded, he
said, and he is now gathering firsthand reports of refugees who
have fled.
</P>
<P>
   Asma Jahangir, a Pakistani lawyer who is the investigator for
extrajudicial and summary executions, has faced death threats and
has been under police protection for years.
</P>
<P>
   Rapporteurs examine not only government conduct, but also
broader wrongdoing. In addition to torture, that includes religious
intolerance, child prostitution, the effects of armed conflict on
children, the sale of children, violence against women and extreme
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The role of the special rapporteurs dates from 1978, when it was
decided that a single person should replace the traditional working
groups, usually consisting of several people from various regions,
to examine strife-ridden countries.
</P>
<P>
   The idea spread, according to John Pace, an official with the
U.N. Human Rights Office in Geneva. In the '80s fact-finders were
named for Argentina, Bolivia and Guatemala, among others, along
with rapporteurs to investigate abuses across national boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Under U.N. rules, the work depends on the cooperation of
countries, which have to invite them to visit and which often
stonewall. For years, China ignored British law professor Nigel
Rodley's request to visit. This year, Rodley finally received an
invitation and plans a trip early next year.
</P>
<P>
   The refusal of a country to cooperate creates what some see as a
weakness in the reporting system. Rapporteurs who are locked out of
a country are forced to depend largely, if not exclusively, on
information from nongovernmental organizations, which can be
unreliable or biased, rather than on firsthand interviews and
information gathering.

 &HT;    Cable operators face few disadvantages after AT&AMP;T's buy
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ AT&AMP;T's purchase of MediaOne leaves surprisingly smooth
waters for Cox Communications and other cable TV operators to
navigate.
</P>
<P>
   True, for the first time, MediaOne, the largest owner of cable
TV systems, will no longer be a cable TV operator. Long distance
carrier AT&AMP;T will now hold that distinction, controlling systems
that pass 60 million homes nationwide. Its systems will include the
one in the city of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's tentative purchase also pushes Atlanta-based Cox
Communications further down in the rankings of largest cable TV
operators. Cox Communications is between fifth and seventh,
depending on how the ranking is calculated.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's No. 1 status, for the most part, is not expected to
accelerate the deployment of digital television in Atlanta or
nationwide. Nor will it hail the broad introduction of interactive
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``AT&AMP;T's purchase means nothing in terms of new services and
pricing to consumers,'' says Abhi Shaki, a director of media
consultant Jupiter Communications.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is because AT&AMP;T is not a television company and
doesn't care much about it. Its interest is in using cable networks
to provide new services such as high-speed access to the Internet
and telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   Those interests dovetail with those of MediaOne, which has one
of the most advanced cable TV systems, but used it to provide local
telephone service and Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``MediaOne has not been aggressive in rolling out digital
television or interactive services,'' says Bruce Leichtman, a cable
analyst with media consultant the Yankee Group.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T does care about Internet access, which it has offered as a
service for years. Some industry observers now believe that the
company will put its immense marketing muscle behind establishing
cable TV's new cable modem technology as the standard Internet
connection.
</P>
<P>
   These modems, using new digital networks of some cable systems,
provide Internet connections up to 100 times faster than
traditional telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine if AT&AMP;T pumps $300 million into marketing cable modems
under its brand name,'' says Shaki. ``That would help all of cable
TV to make these modems mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   Some industry observers wonder whether Cox Communications and
other independent operators can make it alone any more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago we said that you needed at least 1 million
subscribers to be a player,'' said Spencer Grimes, a media analyst
with Solomon Smith Barney. ``Now that number has moved to 5
million.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox Communications, with 4 million subscribers, falls just under
that threshold. ``I think the company can go it alone, but it will
be at a disadvantage,'' says Grimes.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, counters Leichtman. He says size is not as important as
concentration. A cable operator can do well if it dominates a large
and lucrative market, like Cox Communications does in San Diego,
Phoenix and Orange County, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a misconception that you have to be huge to survive or
prosper,'' says Leichtman. ``Cox Communications can survive very
well in the markets it now dominates.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Cox Communications, the company recently told analysts
that it has no intention of selling. It is a buyer. And, as if to
make the point, the company recently announced a $1.4 billion
purchase of cable systems from Media General in Northern Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get bigger,'' says Cox Communications President Jim
Robbins, ``and we are continually chipping away at that.''

   WASHINGTON _ The House is expected to approve a $12.9 billion
emergency funding bill Thursday that would finance the U.S. portion
of the NATO operation against Yugoslavia through Sept. 30, but also
would add billions more in questionable Pentagon spending.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is likely to draw overwhelming, if somewhat reluctant,
support from a majority of Democrats and Republicans. It is
designed to meet the president's request for $6.05 billion in
supplemental military spending for this year to help replenish bomb
and cruise-missile inventories depleted by the allied campaign, and
to help ease the refugee crisis in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   But an attempt by the Republican leadership to add on another
$6.85 billion in spending for some favored programs has angered
members of both parties who believe that unrelated Pentagon
spending issues should be sorted out later, when Congress debates
the 2000 defense appropriations bill.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the GOP leadership is pushing ahead with the added
funding, despite objections from the Clinton administration that it
goes well beyond the cost of continuing the Kosovo engagement
through the summer.
</P>
<P>
   To overcome the congressional opposition, House Majority Whip
Tom DeLay, R-Texas, enlisted some defense contractors and lobbyists
last week to remind lawmakers that their own districts could
benefit from the extra spending.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the ``sweeteners,'' as one Republican aide called it,
include a pay increase of $1.8 billion for military personnel,
$1.07 billion in construction funds, $70 million for diplomatic and
consular programs, $1.34 billion for spare parts, and nearly $1
billion for depot maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the administration nor the Pentagon listed as high
priorities many of the items, such as a firing range worth $3
million to be built at the Aviano Air Base in Italy and $48 million
for a complex for bachelor enlisted personnel in Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
   But they are priorities for Republican lawmakers who, because of
budget constraints set by law, have been unable to get all of what
they want attached to previous defense spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats would also like to see many of the add-ons to the
Kosovo measure approved, especially the military pay raise. But
they want those issues addressed in the regular appropriations
process.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., the ranking Democrat on the House
Appropriations Committee, conceded last week that much of the extra
spending proposals are ``worthy.'' But he stood by his charge that
Republicans are trying to turn the emergency Kosovo measure into a
``pork barrel'' spending bill of sorts to assure passage of
spending measures that could get left out of the Pentagon's 2000
budget.
</P>
<P>
   The added spending also troubles some conservative Republicans
who are vigorous Pentagon advocates. One of them, Rep. Sam Johnson
of Plano, Texas, is having a tough time reconciling the need to
replenish ammunition and weapons supplies with his opposition to
U.S. involvement in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a former prisoner of war in Vietnam, was still
undecided Wednesday about how he will vote on the emergency
measure. He would prefer not to support it, one aide acknowledged,
because of his opposition to the NATO campaign and because the bill
includes additional spending that he believes should be addressed
in the regular appropriations process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's fair to say that he is frustrated at this
point,'' the aide said. ``He does not want to forward-fund the war,
and he thinks that this is the wrong vehicle for adding on all this
other stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Johnson, like many other members of Congress, may vote
for it to show support for U.S. personnel and to ensure their
safety as the NATO operations proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is planning to vote on the Kosovo funding bill soon
but is unlikely to include additional spending much beyond the
president's $6 billion request. The two versions then would be
reconciled in a conference committee.
</P>
<P>
   The House Democratic leadership, meanwhile, is advising members
to vote for the Kosovo measure regardless of how they feel about
Republican efforts to beef it up and the vote by most GOP members
last week against continuing the allied air campaign. House
Democratic leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri said last week that the
GOP vote was ``inconsistent'' with Republicans' attempts to
``double-fund'' the president's Kosovo spending request.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general sense (among Democratic leaders) is they
(Republicans) are trying to have it both ways. They've been very
reckless and very irresponsible in how they've voted on the war so
far, but they're trying to use the war as political cover to fix
some of the spending problems they've had because of the (budget)
caps,'' said one Democratic leadership aide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling is ... the Republicans have done enough damage and
we don't want to compound that by voting against this bill.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, writing in USA Today on Wednesday, said it was perfectly
legitimate for Republicans to ``cast a vote of no confidence
against the president and vote for funding troops in the field at
the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply put, we must not sacrifice the safety of our troops at
the expense of a deeply flawed policy,'' he wrote.

TEXAS' EX-ATTORNEY GENERAL ACCUSED OF FRAUD IN TOBACCO SETTLEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Texas attorney general on Wednesday filed court papers
accusing his predecessor of giving a fraudulent contract to a
lawyer friend who was awarded $260 million in legal fees from the
state's settlement with the tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   In those papers, filed in U.S. District Court Court in
Texarkana, Texas, Attorney General John Cornyn said that former
Attorney General Dan Morales created phony contracts for Marc Murr,
a Houston lawyer, which Murr would get as much as 3 percent of the
$17.3 billion settlement that Texas reached in its lawsuit against
the nation's cigarette makers.
</P>
<P>
   In September, an arbitration panel in Texas awarded Murr $260
million. But three months later, after other lawyers in the case
told a national arbitration panel they were not even aware that
Murr had been involved in the lawsuit, Murr's fees were reduced to
$1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Murr is still seeking hundreds of millions of dollars from the
state for his role in the lawsuit, while Cornyn has opposed the fee
request.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Morales, a Democrat who did not seek re-election
last year, called the accusations false and ``bizarre'' and said
that Cornyn, a Republican who took office in January, was smearing
Morales to hurt his future political hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Murr could not be reached for comment, and his lawyer, Roy
Minton of Austin, did not return a telephone call.
</P>
<P>
   The federal judge who oversaw the Texas tobacco case, David
Folsom, has scheduled a hearing Thursday in Texarkana for Murr to
show why the state panel's $260 million award should not be thrown
out. Cornyn had sought to compel Morales to testify at the hearing,
but Folsom ruled late Wednesday against requiring his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has also been investigating the matter, according to
people who have been contacted by investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Murr and Morales worked together as associates at a Houston law
firm in the early 1980s, and have been friends ever since. Murr
also helped raise money for Morales' political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Texas ended its lawsuit against the tobacco industry in January
1998, becoming the third state, after Mississippi and Florida, to
win a large settlement for lawsuits that sought to recoup the costs
of treating smoking-related illnesses of Medicaid patients.
</P>
<P>
   Part of those settlements required the tobacco industry to pay
the fees for lawyers who handled the states' cases. In December,
before the three-member panel that convened in New York to
determine those amounts, Morales said that Murr played an important
role in the Texas case. But other lawyers sharply criticized Murr's
fee request, saying they believed he actually played little, if
any, role in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Murr and Morales had appeared before the separate
state arbitration panel in Texas that determined Murr was entitled
to $260 million, a claim now pending before the federal court in
Texarkana. Murr had also sought to use the $260 million state award
to convince the national panel to award him a high fee.
</P>
<P>
   But that state award was ``procured by fraud,'' according to
Cornyn's filing, which alleges that Murr and Morales presented the
state panel with a fake contract _ created a few weeks before the
panel met but dated Oct. 17, 1996 _ that said Murr was entitled to
a fee of 3 percent of the Texas settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn also alleges that a separate contract with Murr, dated
Jan. 31, 1997, is also fake. He said that contract was created
after that date when the signatures of Murr, Morales and another
state official were ``switched'' from a separate ``secret''
contract after another lawyer who had signed on to the case, Will
Pryor, decided that he did not want to be involved in the lawsuit.
Pryor could not be reached for comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Morales' lawyer, Sam Millsap of San Antonio, said the
accusations were political. ``This is the first shot from the
Republican Party for what they expect to be the governor's race in
2002,'' Millsap said. They're trying to take Dan out as a potential
candidate for governor in 2002.''
</P>
<P>
   Millsap said the contracts were not doctored, and he accused
Cornyn of trying to turn Thursday's court hearing in Texarkana into
a ``star chamber.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn was traveling to Texarkana on Wednesday and was not
available for comment. A spokesman, Ted Delisi, declined to say
what evidence the attorney general has that the contracts are
phony, and he said Cornyn only made the allegations after Morales
sought to avoid being called as a witness at Thursday's hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Delisi also denied that politics played any role in the attorney
general's investigation.

CLINTON VISITS WITH U.S. TROOPS IN MORALE-BOOSTING TRIP TO EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMSTEIN AIR BASE, Germany _ Donning a brown bomber jacket in
solidarity with the NATO forces in Yugoslavia, President Clinton
began a two-day morale-boosting trip to Europe on Wednesday that
included a brief visit with the three American soldiers who were
recently released from Serbian captivity.
</P>
<P>
   His trip here was the closest Clinton has come to the Yugoslav
theater of war since NATO began bombing Serbia on March 24. Despite
a packed schedule that took him from Brussels to two air bases in
Germany, the visit, in a gray drizzly chill, was a subdued one for
the weary-looking president, for whom the war presents an array of
nettlesome complications.
</P>
<P>
   Because of diplomatic moves between the United States and Russia
over how to end the Balkan conflict and a meeting of the Group
Seven countries plus Russia in Bonn on Thursday, Clinton's schedule
was expanded from a 24-hour visit with troops to include talks with
NATO commanders in Brussels on Wednesday morning and a visit with
Germany's chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, on Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The visit also included plans to meet with relief agencies
handling the refugee crisis and to boost the spirits of the
thousands of military personnel providing support for the NATO
mission.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton addressed the troops at the American air base in
Spangdahlem and then here, where he locked into an earnest
discussion with nine men during supper in a hangar under the
propeller of a hulking C-30 transport plane.
</P>
<P>
   He said later that they talked about the war as well as the
military's recruitment problems and low pay and that he assured
them of bipartisan support in Congress for a pay raise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States military, because of people like you, can do
things for a troubled world that no one else can do,'' the
president told the troops after supper. ``And I'm profoundly
grateful.''
</P>
<P>
   He arrived in Brussels on Wednesday morning after an overnight
flight from Washington to the news that the two pilots of an Apache
helicopter had been killed, apparently in a training accident. They
are the first American casualties of the Kosovar conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said that the immediate fall-out of the war _ the
overwhelming difficulty of helping perhaps as many as 1.5 million
refugees _ weighed heavily on Clinton, even as the United States
accepted its first planeload of 453 refugees on Wednesday at Fort
Dix, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Atwood, head of the Agency for International Development,
who traveled here with Clinton, said that the quandary of the
refugees dominated the president's private talks on Wednesday.
``The international community is going to, at times in the next few
weeks, appear to be very disorganized,'' Atwood said, contemplating
the scale of the effort.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the president's public appearances on Wednesday were
fairly low-key. His speech at the American air base in Spangdahlem
was just 17 minutes, and he seemed to hasten through his stack of
events, putting himself uncharacteristically ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton began his day at NATO headquarters in Brussels by
meeting with Secretary General Javier Solana. He was then briefed
by Gen. Wesley K. Clark, the supreme allied commander. He later
flew here and met privately with the three former captives and
their families for about 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he thought Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav president,
had let them go, Clinton declined to speculate. ``The important
thing is he did let them go,'' Clinton told reporters.

MEDICARE CUTS COULD CREATE FISCAL `CARNAGE' FOR NEW YORK'S TEACHING
HOSPITALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Sidebar with EDUC-HOSPITALS) 
(DW) 
 By RANDY KENNEDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK_ The fiscal knife that has begun to cut into teaching
hospitals in Boston and other cities has not yet had the same dire
effects _ layoffs or widespread operating deficits _ in hospitals
around New York state.
</P>
<P>
   But hospital executives and health-care experts alike say that
if the federal cuts to Medicare are not softened, the state will
lose much more than any other _ $5 billion and 23,000 medical jobs
_ by 2002. They warn those cuts, a result of the Balanced Budget
Act, pose a huge economic threat to New York, which has nation's
greatest concentration of medical schools and teaching hospitals
and trains about 15 percent of the nation's medical residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The carnage which is created by the Balanced Budget Act will
totally disrupt the health care system in New York when it's fully
implemented,'' said Kenneth Raske, president of the Greater New
York Hospital Association, a trade group of 175 hospitals and
nursing homes. ``It goes at the heart of the infrastructure.''
</P>
<P>
   The cuts, now in their second year, come at the same time as
sharp increases in uninsured patients and the growing dominance of
managed care, which have prompted all hospitals in the New York
region to brace for what they say will be one of the most difficult
fiscal years ever.
</P>
<P>
   But with critics complaining that New York still has too many
hospital beds and administrative fat that should be trimmed, those
who run the prestigious teaching hospitals in the city find it hard
to make their case that the Medicare cuts put them in real peril.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this sounds like wolf, wolf, wolf because of the
successes generally in the health care industry,'' said Dr. Spencer
Foreman, president of Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx, which lost
$24 million in Medicare money in fiscal 1999. ``But New York
teaching hospitals are in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   His own hospital did $750 million dollars in business in 1993
and ended that year with a $3 million profit margin. This year, it
will do $1 billion in business and end with a $6 million margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are supermarket margins,'' he said, adding that the
hospital has ``managed to keep a razor-thin margin every year by
every year cutting costs and cutting again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But you can only cut so far before things begin to happen. The
industry is touching bottom in a lot of areas, and the difference
between profit and loss in this atmosphere is an eyelash. This is
not the way normal billion-dollar enterprises are conducted.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the teaching hospitals have traditionally served a high
percentage of poor patients, the threat to their future is even
more important, Foreman and others said.
</P>
<P>
   While he and other teaching hospital administrators avoid
talking about it, the only way to keep from going into the red is
to cut jobs and either shrink or close money-losing departments _
which usually means emergency rooms, outpatient clinics,
psychiatric and rehabilitation departments and maternity wards,
among others.
</P>
<P>
   ``The so-called low hanging fruit has all been picked,'' said
Dr. David B. Skinner, the chief executive of New York Presbyterian
Hospital, where every department has been asked to cut spending by
5 percent. The Greater New York Hospital Association projects that
New York Presbyterian will lose more money over the course of the
Balanced Budget Act than any other American hospital _ about $320
million.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner said that as the hospital plans its year 2000 budget
``we're going to have to look very closely at staffing ratios.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Something's got to give here,'' he said. ``You then look at
where can you downsize departments that are losing money. And we're
looking at that now. I don't want to say which ones because I don't
want to unnecessarily panic the troops.''
</P>
<P>
   While the refrain in health-care politics in New York is usually
for hospitals to cry poverty and many experts and budget analysts
to cry hyperbole, experts said that the teaching hospitals are
probably not exaggerating their problems much.
</P>
<P>
   ``This certainly appears to be putting real strains on teaching
hospitals throughout the country and especially in New York,'' said
Edward Salsberg, director of the Center for Health Workforce
Studies at the state university at Albany. ``They seem to be
building a case that this year it is more real than other years.''

<P>
   MULHALL, Okla. _ Standing on the sidewalk outside Mulhall's
elementary school, kindergarten teacher Judy Knight was beginning
to grasp the wallop that Monday's tornado had unleashed on this
tiny farming community.
</P>
<P>
   The 50-year-old grandmother, who has lived in Mulhall all her
life, watched teachers and their spouses sift through the remains
of desks, books and lockers in search of anything that could be
salvaged.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to her left, Knight could see her place of worship, the
Mulhall Christian Church, where the front portion of the chapel was
crumpled onto the front lawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's starting to sink in just how bad this storm
was,'' Knight said. ``It didn't really leave any of the town
untouched.''
</P>
<P>
   The tornado that descended upon this town of 250 wasn't as
destructive as the massive twister that hit several hours earlier
50 miles to the south in the Oklahoma City area. But it struck a
near-fatal blow to the community's core.
</P>
<P>
   Every one of the town's 110 homes was damaged. Fifty are
considered uninhabitable, 50 have major damage, and 10 have minor
damage, according to a survey by the Oklahoma Fire Marshal's
Office.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the damage, there were no serious injuries in Mulhall.
</P>
<P>
   Besides hitting the elementary school _ which might be a total
loss _ the tornado hammered the post office, a fire station and all
three of the town's churches. It also toppled the town's
75-foot-water tower, and the water washed a nearby frame house off
its foundation. Two 50,000-bushel grain storage bins also were
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``wE HAD A PRETTY NICE TOWN AND THEN AN HOUR LATER IT WAS JUST
GONE,'' SAID Willis Doggett, chief of Mulhall's volunteer fire
department.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just wiped out our infrastructure,'' he said. ``We have no
water, no sewer and no electricity _ and that's just the tip of the
iceberg. That doesn't even address how we build this town back to
what it was.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials estimate that a limited supply of water will be
restored by this weekend, but it could be two weeks before the town
gets electricity.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the obstacles, Mayor John Pangburn was optimistic
that the tornado, which tore the roof off his house, would wake
Mulhall from its doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   The town, which was formed in 1889, was named for Wild West
promoter Zack Mulhall, whose daughter Lucille was dubbed ``The
World's First Cowgirl,'' according to a historic marker.
</P>
<P>
   Pangburn, who retired to Mulhall eight years ago from San Diego,
said that heritage and Mulhall's compact size give residents a
chance to improve the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before this happened, there was a tendency for people here to
be apathetic,'' Pangburn said. ``Now we've got a chance to get rid
of some derelict homes that had become fire traps because of
neglect. I'm a positive thinker, so I'm convinced we'll make it
better.''
</P>
<P>
   One business owner, Jackie Pfeiffer, was an overnight convert to
the mayor's philosophy. Pfeiffer, who owns the only convenience
store in town, went to bed Tuesday night questioning whether she
should rebuild after the storm tore away her store's roof but left
shelves and refrigerated units standing.
</P>
<P>
   Her small store was the only place in town for residents to buy
food, and also served as the community's only restaurant with a
small grill and fryer behind the counter. In effect, it was
Mulhall's unofficial gathering place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked so depressing around here the morning after, I had
to ask myself whether I wanted to start over from scratch,''
Pfeiffer said. ``I put a lot of time into this place and I was
telling myself I was ready to move on. But after 150 people stop
by, begging you to rebuild, what choice do you have? You've got to
rebuild.''

<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY _ Sondra Doty clings to the memory of her
husband's goodbye kiss and the sound of his voice on the telephone
after she called him at his job Monday to warn him of the
approaching tornado.
</P>
<P>
   She would not see him again until the next day, after a
supervisor at an Oklahoma hospital asked her to come to the
facility and identify his body.
</P>
<P>
   The tornado that swept through the Oklahoma City area Monday
night passed behind Spencer's Super Thrift, the Newcastle store
where Bill Doty worked as assistant manager. The 54-year-old man
suffered a heart attack during the ordeal, his wife said.
</P>
<P>
   She rushed to Southwestern Medical Center to be by his side at 8
p.m., but chaos during the tornado's aftermath apparently left some
hospital employees unaware that Bill Doty was there, Sondra Doty
said. It would be six hours before the matter would be cleared up
and Doty would learn that her husband had died within minutes of
arriving at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a nightmare,'' Sondra Doty said. ``It was like a bad
movie, but it was happening to me.''
</P>
<P>
   For dozens of families, the details are different, but the
horror is the same. Just as with Sondra Doty, the deaths of their
loved ones has left them embracing bittersweet memories.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time that Melissa Battaglia is facing motherhood for
the second time, she struggles with being a widow. Her husband,
37-year-old Anthony Battaglia, was killed Monday by flying debris
as he crouched beside a loading dock, using his body to shield
other employees from the tornado.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was real excited about having a little girl,'' recalled
Battaglia's mother-in-law, Marilyn Smith. The couple had picked out
the baby's name: Natalie. ``She's got a hard time ahead. She has a
very large extended family, so hopefully that will help her get
through it,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said her son-in-law was very outgoing and never met a
stranger.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we appreciate was his sense of humor and his outgoing
personality and his love for his family,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Killed along with Battaglia was co-worker Jerry Webb of Enid,
Okla. He also perished trying to shield others from the deadly
tornado.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were both really respected and loved around there,'' said
Terry Stambaugh, executive vice president of human resources for
their employer, American Freightways. ``They'll be greatly
missed.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Webb said his brother was a typical ``redneck cowboy'' who
cared greatly for others and had a large family.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just a good cowboy and he was always ready to help
somebody else,'' Ray Webb said. ``I never heard him complain.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Webb lived on a farm in Enid and had about 20 head of
cattle, his brother said. There, he enjoyed fishing and hunting.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Webb said his brother's third wife, Becky, is taking his
death hard, as are his nine children. Jerry Webb was one of 10
children. His mother, 91-year-old Delma Ruth Webb, had been living
with him, but is now staying with sister Marilyn.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, workers searching the debris of the destroyed
building found the trademark black cowboy hat that Webb wore, and
which co-workers described as his ``pride and joy.'' Employees plan
to give the hat to Webb's widow, Stambaugh said.
</P>
<P>
   Sondra Doty said that in her husband's last moments, he also
focused on others.
</P>
<P>
   In a rushed telephone conversation, Bill Doty told his wife that
he and fellow employees were heading to the store's cooler, and he
urged his wife to take their 8-year-old son Dakota and seek
shelter. She told him they would hide in the closet, and the couple
hung up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was worried about us, Dakota and I,'' Sondra Doty said.
``He was worried about us and his employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Doty described her husband as upbeat and a hard worker who
always put her and their two children first. Bill Doty was a native
of Marlow. It was there, at a dance held at a roller skating rink,
that the couple met. Two months later they married, Sondra Doty
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friends, family and everyone told us it wouldn't last six
months,'' she said with a laugh. They were to celebrate their 30th
anniversary in September.

FBI JOINS SEARCH FOR MISSING IN BRIDGE CREEK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By BETSY BLANEY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGE CREEK, Okla. _ The FBI has joined in the effort to help
account for Bridge Creek residents who remained missing two days
after a monster tornado scarred the landscape and decimated homes
in this semi-rural community, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Five people remained unaccounted for late Wednesday, Grady
County Sheriff Stan Florence said. The list stood at eight early in
the day, but FBI agents whittled the number by three, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Information was unavailable as to where the three were located.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven are confirmed dead from the twister that struck Monday
evening. Their names had not been released late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Because phone lines are still out and residents may have gone
elsewhere before or after the storm, the number of missing can
change by the hour, Florence said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the missing might be in hospitals scattered around the
Oklahoma City area, unconscious and unable to identify themselves,
Florence said.
</P>
<P>
   Some bodies may not have been found, he said.
</P>
<P>
   All resources are being directed toward accounting for all of
the area's residents, Florence said. Authorities used search dogs
all day to look for victims, but none had been were found by the
evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's our big issue now,'' he said. ``Matching up names with
bodies _ missing and dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Ridgecrest Baptist Church, which was a mass of mangled metal
after the tornado struck, had a service in an amphitheater next to
the 20-year-old church.
</P>
<P>
   Pastor Tom Duckett wanted his church members ``to see each
other, love each other.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And pray for people we don't see,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State Sen. Carol Martin was at Snow Hill Baptist
Church, one of two locations in the Bridge Creek area where food,
clothing and other necessities were being collected for those in
need.
</P>
<P>
   Her district covers Bridge Creek, Moore and South Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers are the backbone of the area pulling together, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are coming out of the woodwork,'' she said. ``We're doing
the best we can. How can you make a sane situation out of chaotic
one?''
</P>
<P>
   In Newcastle, a bedroom community of about 3,800 residents east
of Bridge Creek, about 500 homes were damaged or destroyed,
Newcastle Police Chief John Quinton said yesterday. Fortunately,
the storm hit the north side of the city where there are fewer
homes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   There were minor injuries but no deaths from the storm in
Newcastle, Quinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Livestock, however, is a different matter. No one really knows
how many animals were lost because fences went down and animals are
roaming freely, Quinton said. Many likely were killed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some people with dead animals on their property who
don't own livestock,'' Quinton said.

NATO AND RUSSIA TO ISSUE JOINT STATEMENT ON A KOSOVO FORCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also KOSOVO-NATO) 
(bl) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Western allies and Russia have narrowed
their differences over a future international force in Kosovo to
the point where they will be able to issue a joint statement
Thursday on ending the conflict in the Serbian province, U.S. and
NATO officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A senior German official said an outline accord had been reached
with Russia on the need for ``an international civil and security
presence'' that would enter Kosovo under a United Nations mandate
after an eventual withdrawal of Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   But officials stressed that gaining Russia's agreement to a
joint statement was still a long way from winning the agreement of
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   But subtle changes in official announcements and news in
Yugoslavia have led journalists and analysts to suspect that
Milosevic may be preparing Serbian public opinion for a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The joint statement, to be issued after a meeting in Bonn of
foreign ministers from the Group of Seven most industrialized
nations plus Russia, is intended rather to increase the isolation
of Milosevic, who has looked to Moscow for support, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The partial reconciliation with Russia, after ties were strained
to breaking point at the start of NATO's bombing campaign,
represented a boost to President Clinton as he arrived in Germany
on Wednesday. His two-day visit is intended to cement allied unity
over the Kosovo campaign and bolster a German government under
increasing pressure from critics of the air war.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving for Germany, Clinton said that he believed it was
important ``that the Russians, perhaps the Ukrainians, perhaps
others who come from the Orthodox tradition, who have close ties to
the Serbs, be a part of such a mission.''
</P>
<P>
   French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said Wednesday that the
meeting of foreign ministers from the so-called G8 countries
``should enable the West and Russia to set out the principles of a
solution in Kosovo.'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who is
traveling with the president, will attend.
</P>
<P>
   To get the Russians on board, the officials said, the statement
was likely not to name NATO, nor to spell out an explicit role for
the alliance in the proposed force. Milosevic and the Russians have
strongly opposed any NATO force in Kosovo, leading allied officials
in recent statements to speak of an international force with NATO
``at its core.''
</P>
<P>
   To meet another Russian desire, the statement is also expected
to refer to the need for a mandate from the United Nations for the
Kosovo force.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the omission of specific reference to NATO in the
statement should not be interpreted as a change of policy.
``There's a gray area here,'' one official said. ``Given our desire
to have the Russians, no one is going to be insistent on ramming
down the throat of the Russians every element of NATO's five
points.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said many differences with Russia remained, but enough
progress had been made for a statement that would call for the
return of all refugees and the deployment of an international force
to protect them _ both central demands of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The exact composition, mandate and weaponry of the international
force, the degree of Serbian military withdrawal from Kosovo, how
any such withdrawal would be linked to an end to the NATO bombing
campaign, and whether a solution can be imposed rather than
negotiated, remain contentious questions with Russia, they said.
</P>
<P>
   German Foreign Minister Joshcka Fishcer wants to use the accord
with Russia as the basis for a U.N. Security Council resolution
agreed upon under Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which, unlike
Chapter 6, does not require the consent of the parties to any
dispute for the authorization of military operations.
</P>
<P>
   German officials said no diplomatic breakthrough was expected
during Clinton's stay and made clear that the bombing was expected
to continue at least into next week, despite the president's first
allusion Monday to the possibility of a pause.
</P>
<P>
   The longer NATO's campaign goes on, the more frayed the
``Red-Green'' coalition of German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder may
become. Already, Schroeder is facing some vociferous calls for an
end to the war from within his own Social Democratic Party and from
the once pacifist Greens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bombing of Serbia cannot be justified from any possible
standpoint,'' Oskar Lafontaine, a prominent Social Democrat and
former finance minister, said last weekend. ``It is wrong to label
whole groups of people good or evil. It is senseless to bomb
bridges and then turn around and plan how to rebuild them.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement was Lafontaine's first since he quit the
government in March. It reflected growing uneasiness on the left of
the Social Democratic Party, although up to now such anti-war
feeling has been fairly muted.
</P>
<P>
   The growing criticism has involved allegations that the bombing
violates international law, outrage over civilian deaths, and
uneasiness at the high cost of the war. Schroeder told his party
executive Monday that the United States was paying 90 percent of
the cost.
</P>
<P>
   The Greens, minority partners in the government, are to hold a
party congress next week that is certain to reflect sharp divisions
over the war. If a motion for an immediate stop to the bombing was
passed, the coalition could be endangered. But Fischer will strive
to avert such a vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not Great Britain,'' said one official close to
Schroeder. ``This war is not an easy sell to a people whose
pacifist feelings are still strong. That is one reason why the
picture of Clinton and Schroeder standing together is so
important.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be particularly important because German uneasiness is
such that any suggestion of the use of ground troops could lead to
the fall of the government. And without ground forces, or even the
threat of their use, NATO's air campaign could be extremely long.
</P>
<P>
   However, senior German officials with normally reliable
intelligence reports believe Milosevic's support may be
increasingly tenuous. ``Those who back Milosevic because they
depend on him see that he cannot protect them any longer,'' one
official said. ``Internal opposition is growing, and that could
become clear next week.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to say what might happen next week, or where the
focus of resistance might emerge.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether allied countries are working on a covert
plan for Milosevic's overthrow _ something they publicly deny _ and
whether the official was indulging in propaganda or wishful
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   The core of Milosevic's backing has traditionally been a small
coterie of ministers and political allies who have been granted
lucrative control of various import-export businesses, from the
well-paid architects of the government's propaganda, and from a
cosseted core of military police officers. The army has been more
ambivalent, at least until the NATO campaign began.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; FEATURE stories &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-CONTRACTS (Undated) _ A slew of recent events _ from the
panic at major labels over the distribution of music on the
Internet to the blood-letting following large music company mergers
_ has made it clear to musicians that the structure of major record
companies is not conducive to either their financial or, more
important, their artistic goals. Talking to everyone from
up-and-coming bands to those who have been signed for more than a
decade, from artists with low sales to superstars, from lawyers to
former executives, there is a growing dissatisfaction with a system
that has been building its fortress for more than 100 years _ since
a company called Columbia sprung up to challenge Thomas Edison's
exclusive distribution of prerecorded cylinders to be played on the
phonograph he invented. By Neil Strauss. &UR;  &LR; (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   THREE-SEASONS-FILM (Undated) _ The Vietnamese film by Tony Bui,
``Three Seasons,'' opened in New York on April 30 and will open
nationwide on Friday. It is the first American feature film to
attempt a portrait of contemporary postwar Vietnam, poised on the
brink of modernity. ``Three Seasons,'' which landed a major
American star, (Harvey Keitel who has been known to be partial to
small, independent films), is an interweaving of three stories and
operates on several narrative levels: past and present, personal
and national, realistic and poetic. By Laura Winters. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ELIZABETH-FRANZ-THEATER (New York) _ Some people say there has
never been a Linda like that of Elizabeth Franz as Willy Loman's
wife in ``Death of a Salesman.'' The play's author is one of them.
Speaking of the actress's portrayal in the 50th-anniversary
production now on Broadway, Arthur Miller said, ``She has
discovered in the role the basic underlying powerful
protectiveness, which comes out as fury, and that in the past, in
every performance I know of, was simply washed out.'' By Dinitia
Smith. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   ANNIE-REVIVAL-THEATER (subslug) (Undated) _ The story creaks,
the characters are stereotypes from another time, the theatrical
style doesn't work on modern audiences, but oh, that music. It is
as fresh as on the day it was born. Surely we're talking about ``La
Sonnambula'' or one of its bel canto opera pals, but what about
``Annie Get Your Gun,'' a musical pulled forcibly from the past and
now running strong at the Marquis Theater on Broadway? Vincenzo
Bellini and Irving Berlin have more things in common than you
think: not least, an infallible gift for melody. By Bernard
Holland. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MONTE-CARLO-BALLET (Undated) _ With its Mediterranean vistas and
posh casinos, the little principality of Monaco has reigned for
generations as a playground for the rich and famous. It's not all
fun and games, though, for Les Ballets de Monte Carlo, a local
troupe that spent 48 weeks rehearsing and performing last year. Led
by Jean-Christophe Maillot, an amiable young Frenchman with big
ambitions, this 14-year-old company is striving to reconcile its
loyalty to tradition with a passion for something new. It seems
fitting that the company will take up this theme when it opens a
weeklong season at City Center in Manhattan on Wednesday. By
Christopher Reardon. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BEBE-MILLER-DANCE (New York) _ The choreographer Bebe Miller,
wearing baggy black pants and a simple black shirt, took a position
in front of the wall-length mirror. A compact woman with
dreadlocks, she faced front, then side, then back, and front again,
allowing herself to be scrutinized. Over a tape recording came her
mellow voice. ``Who is looking for gay men in the group?'' The
questions are aimed at her audiences. ``Who is counting the white
people?'' ``How important is it that these dancers work for a black
choreographer?'' The dancers remained lost in their own worlds
until a gentle rap by the Fugees started up. They then fell into
loose, silky movements. ``This section represents a party,'' Ms.
Miller reminded them. ``Don't be so serious.'' But this 60-minute
piece, ``Going to the Wall,'' which premiered at Dartmouth College
last year, is very serious. It will have its New York premiere on
Tuesday at the Joyce Theater, beginning a weeklong engagement, its
first in three years. By Valerie Gladstone. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MCDUFFIE-MUSIC (Undated) _ A lot of musicians these days are
already starting international careers before they have completed
the early stages of professional development, so that they find
themselves putting their clothes on in public. Into such a world
suddenly comes Robert McDuffie, 40, a violinist fully and
impeccably dressed, ready to make his New York Philharmonic debut
on Thursday evening at Avery Fisher Hall after nearly two decades
of giving coconcerts. By Paul Griffiths. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   KOUSSEVITZKY-MUSIC (Undated) _ At a time when the New York
Philharmonic celebrates George Gershwin one season and Aaron
Copland the next, it is easy to forget that the groundbreaking
music of American composers once went unheard in concert halls.
Indeed, such scores were ultimately absorbed into the canon largely
through the efforts of one man, Serge Koussevitzky, the first major
maestro to make ``modern'' American music a priority. A double-bass
virtuoso born in Russia, Koussevitzky led the Boston Symphony
Orchestra from 1924 to 1949 and blazed a trail for innovative
American music by not only performing new scores but also
commissioning more. By David Mermelstein. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   GILBERTO-GIL-MUSIC (Undated) _ Gilberto Gil, like Caetano
Veloso, Os Mutantes and Carlinhos Brown, comes from the Brazilian
state of Bahia. If the Brazilian-music fetishism of the moment
centers too heavily on that northern region (and especially on the
late 60s Tropicalia movement), it doesn't change the fact that
``Ensaio Geral,'' a 12-CD set of early work by Gil, is an
extraordinary document _ a tracking of a distinctly Bahian but also
fairly universal pop artist's growth and achievement. By Ben
Ratliff. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ST-JOHN-CATHEDRAL-ART (New York) _ The history of the quarries
of Vinalhaven Island, Maine, and specifically, the erection of
eight monumental columns in the St. John the Divine Cathedral's
sanctuary, are the subject of an exhibition lining the cathedral's
photography wall. ``The Eight Columns of Worship: A Tribute to
Human Ingenuity and Faith,'' tells the story behind the buildings
that stand as a testament to the majesty and endurance of
Vinalhaven granite. By Kathryn Shattuck. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   GLASGOW-ARCHITECTURE (Glasgow, Scotland) _ Glasgow, which was
named the United Kingdom's City of Architecure and Design for 1999,
is looking to the future as much as reveling in the past. Through
the end of the year, it is devoting itself to architecture and
design through a program called Glasgow 1999, a dizzying array of
more than 300 exhibits, building projects, competitions,
conferences, educational programs and special events. The $62.7
million program, though wide ranging, is placing particular
emphasis on the way architecture and design affect and shape
everyday life. The By Sarah Lyall. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   HUNGARY-PHOTOGRAPHERS (Undated) _ At the turn of the century,
Hungary was the most photo-obsessed country in the world. Princes
and princesses of the Austro-Hungarian Empire frequented photo
exhibitions and proudly displayed their own prints. From a nation
the size of Indiana emerged many of the leading names of modern
photography, including Andre Kertesz, Brassai, Laszlo Moholy-Nagy
and Robert Capa. But four decades of Communist rule isolated
Hungarian photography from this artistic heritage, from the outside
world and from many of its subjects. Now, at the turn of a new
century, Hungarian photographers are struggling to rebuild that
tradition. A series of exhibitions of Hungarian photography is now
on view at the Hungarian Consulate in New York City. By Lyler
Rexer. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANTIQUES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   NAKASHIMA-FURNITURE-ANTIQUES (Undated) _ Like most collectors of
George Nakashima's furniture, Ms. Victoria Fiore, a former opera
singer who worked 15 years as a recepitionist for the furniture
designer, did not just buy a handful of pieces to use as design
accents; she filled her home with his work. Installing Nakashima
tables, chairs, cabinets, bedroom sets and more, she created a
total environment out of his elegant wood furniture, notable for
their angular bases topped with primitive slabs of wood displaying
grain patterns and naturally craggy edges. Last Sunday, the entire
collection _ save for the first stool Ms. Fiore bought _ was sold
for more than $170,000, roughly three times the presale estimate,
at David Rago Modern Auctions in Lambertville, N.J., one of the
primary auctioneers of Nakashima furniture. By Elizabeth Hayt.

DISASTER BRINGS NEW WORKLOAD FOR FEMA OFFICIALS

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY _ Mary Ann Carlisle drove into what used to be the
thriving suburban neighborhood of Frolich Meadows in southeast
Oklahoma City on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After a tornado ripped through the area Monday night, smashing
dozens of homes into rubble and splinters, the most visible signs
of the neighborhood were neighbors salvaging lost memories.
</P>
<P>
   It's Carlisle's job to help them rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   ``Total devastation,'' said Carlisle, a reservist for the
Federal Emergency Management Agency who lives in Waco, Texas.
``Total devastation.''
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, teams from FEMA and the state of Oklahoma began the
seemingly endless task of contacting residents and city officials _
and explaining how to apply for federal grants and loans available
after President Clinton declared 11 counties in Oklahoma a disaster
area.
</P>
<P>
   The process will take many days, Carlisle said.
</P>
<P>
   Carlisle and Lynn Roberts, who is from Northern California,
started the outreach program in Del City, asking city officials to
point out the hardest-hit areas. Then they went to nearby
neighborhoods to hand out fliers detailing the
application-by-telephone process. They were chauffeured by Tommy
Kirkpatrick, a retired IRS agent from Oklahoma City whose sole
mission is to take the FEMA representatives anywhere they need to
go.
</P>
<P>
   For residents, some of whom rolled up the yellow fliers in their
tired, mud-caked hands, the information was much appreciated. But
many had more immediate concerns on their minds. Just two days
after the deadly storm, they were just beginning to pick up the
pieces of shattered lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ain't worried about that right now,'' said Tony Helms, 46, a
Frolich Hills homeowner, referring to the federal aid.
</P>
<P>
   Helms survived the tornado in a bathtub with his wife and
mother-in-law. The bathroom walls are gone, as is most of the
house, and his white Ford Escort sits upside down in what used to
be a den. They survived unhurt, but took with them only some
clothes and a drawer full of compact discs and cassette tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ought to be dead,'' said Helms, who plans to contact FEMA as
he works out details with his insurance company. ``This whole
neighborhood ought to be dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Bush, who survived the tornado alone in a closet with
pillows over his head, was not sure he would even try to rebuild
the 1,900-square-foot house he moved into March 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, that's up in the air,'' said Bush, 48, a team
leader at a nearby General Motors plant. ``We really don't know
about that yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Still holding the flier, Bush said he didn't even know if he was
eligible for FEMA's help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have insurance, and FEMA could probably help people worse
off,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Carlisle stressed throughout the afternoon, renters,
homeowners or business owners with even minimal damage could be
eligible for aid, including Small Business Administration loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are your tax dollars at work,'' she told residents and
local officials.
</P>
<P>
   FEMA officials, who only Wednesday began sending teams to
neighborhoods, would not estimate the amount of aid tornado victims
might receive. Up to 300 military reservists will be on hand to
help assess damage and deal with recovery, said Billy Penn, a
spokesman for FEMA's Region VI headquarters in Denton, Texas, who
arrived in Oklahoma City by daylight Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   FEMA and its state counterpart also coordinate the deployment of
``assets'' such as water tanks, flashlights, hard hats and
generators.
</P>
<P>
   But, to the people picking the rubble of their homes, FEMA's
true contribution will come in the form of financial aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll contact FEMA and see what my options are,'' said Leroy
Nitzel, 64, a retired truck driver whose Frolich Hills home was
largely spared. His neighbors' homes across the street were razed.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, FEMA has countless residents to contact. In Del
City, a town of about 24,000, nearly 560 homes were destroyed, said
Judy Gordon, Del City's assistant to the city manager. Inspectors
are still trying to assess the damage there.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's hardly any houses in those areas,'' she said, pointing
to a map. ``They are all leveled.''

 &HT;    Alabama proposal attracts Honda
 &HT;    By Karl Ritzler
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Alabama is likely to use part of its $3.2 billion
tobacco settlement to help attract a Honda Motor Co. auto plant to
a site about 100 miles west of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The incentives Alabama will offer have not been finalized, The
Associated Press reported, but they are expected to include bonds
for the project, with the interest to be paid with $16 million a
year in tobacco money. Local governments are also expected to kick
in $15 million in incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Months of secret negotiations with state officials likely will
culminate today in Birmingham, Ala., with an announcement that
Honda will build a new sport-utility vehicle in Alabama.
Officially, the company maintained Wednesday that no decision has
been made, but Gov. Don Siegelman called a news conference to
announce ``a major economic development.''
</P>
<P>
   The state Legislature debated details of the Alabama incentive
package Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia was under consideration for the plant _ along with
Illinois and Virginia _ but the talks did not progress beyond
discussions with a consultant for an unnamed client, said Randy
Cardoza, commissioner of the Georgia Department of Industry, Trade
&AMP; Tourism. The state was touting an 800-to-2,000-acre site in
Jackson County that has been mentioned as a possible location for
other manufacturing operations. The talks were never called off,
but they aren't active, Cardoza said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Siegelman told the Birmingham News the project will cost more
than the $300 million Mercedes-Benz sport-utility plant that began
production in Vance, near Tuscaloosa, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Honda site is near Lincoln, on Interstate 20 about 50 miles
east of Birmingham in Talladega County and about 50 miles from the
Georgia line, close enough for Georgia to feel some of the economic
impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plant couldn't go to a better place, other than inside
Georgia,'' Cardoza said.
</P>
<P>
   It's close enough to attract suppliers who could locate in
Georgia as well as provide high-paying manufacturing jobs for
Georgians. Lincoln is not too far to commute from west Georgia,
Cardoza added.
</P>
<P>
   While some suppliers will need to be on or near the site for
just-in-time deliveries, others might want a more central location
so they can serve other Southeastern auto plants.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the assembly jobs probably will be filled locally,
although managers and certain skilled workers are likely to be
drawn from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Besides jobs at the auto plant, Cardoza said each job there
generates 1.8-to-3 related jobs.

 &HT;    BellSouth prepares to face competition
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Local phone companies can now see the main rival they
will battle for the huge consumer market and it turns out to be _
their estranged mother.
</P>
<P>
   Once known as Ma Bell, AT&AMP;T Corp. was forced out of local
service and compelled to divest itself of BellSouth and six other
regional phone companies in 1984. However, with Wednesday's
announced deal to buy MediaOne, AT&AMP;T now envisions a return to
local markets with a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   It is a battle for which BellSouth has been preparing _ will it
be ready?
</P>
<P>
   By using upgraded cable lines, AT&AMP;T hopes to offer tens of
millions of cable customers a package that will include phone,
high-speed Internet access and television. And while improvements
to MediaOne wires are incomplete, the upgrades are far ahead of the
former Tele-Communications Inc. franchises that AT&AMP;T bought last
year. With MediaOne, AT&AMP;T will have access to more than half the
homes in the United States. Moreover, in bowing out of the bidding
for MediaOne, Comcast added to AT&AMP;T's local clout by agreeing to
let AT&AMP;T serve its customers too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our chore is to upgrade our own plant, services and
capabilities so we can be an efficient competitor,'' said C. Sidney
Boren, executive staff officer for BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   The chore could be a matter of survival.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Cavallari, executive vice president of Boston-based
consulting company Renaissance Worldwide, said an alternate wire to
millions of homes via cable can be worse than just a damper to
phone company growth. Much of BellSouth's expansion in its
nine-state region has come from consumers adding extra lines for
Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the cable company can give you high-speed Internet access,
you are going to cancel that phone line,'' Cavallari said. ``It's
not just competition for growth _ it's knocking out the second
lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike MediaOne, AT&AMP;T has a nationally recognized and trusted
brand name.
</P>
<P>
   ``AT&AMP;T is thinking, 'we've got 80 million long-distance
customers and we need to touch them with a wire,''' Mines said.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth has for years trumpeted a three-legged strategy:
dominance in the Southeast, combined with lucrative businesses in
Latin American and wireless service. That approach has kept
BellSouth on the sidelines watching other companies merge in a
series of huge deals.
</P>
<P>
   The latest deal sets the stage for confrontation with AT&AMP;T, but
Boren said the biggest surprise is that AT&AMP;T would choose to spend
more than $100 billion to own cable companies, rather than forge
alliances. BellSouth for about six years has been expecting rivalry
from that second wire to the home, he said.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth is betting that digital subscriber line (DSL)
technology can compete with high-speed cable. DSL has a headstart,
since it can work on existing copper lines _ sometimes.
Unfortunately, many lines cannot handle DSL for a range of
technical reasons.
</P>
<P>
   That means that BellSouth too must spend many millions of
dollars more to install revamped lines or add fiber optics,
Cavallari said. ``AT&AMP;T has a steeper hill to climb but they are
resolved they are going to do it. This is the time bomb that
BellSouth and the other regional phone companies are looking at.
You must roll out DSL, and you must roll it out quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth last year started offering DSL in metro Atlanta, but
the rollout has been slow. Perhaps not coincidentally, MindSpring
Enterprises said Wednesday it would finally start offering
BellSouth's DSL service to its customers in the fall. The company
had complained for months that BellSouth had not been cooperative
in setting marketable prices for DSL.
</P>
<P>
   Like the other regional phone companies, BellSouth has held a
virtual monopoly in local service, with challenges mostly limited
to some larger business customers. In Atlanta, BellSouth has only
two competitors for residential service: MGC Communications and
MediaOne, whose upgrade is still unfinished.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts expect AT&AMP;T's deep pockets to ensure a relatively
quick completion of the new, high-speed systems, and if the Bells
do not respond, they will be in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Although overall totals are small, cable modems now outnumber
high-speed phone lines by a 10-1 margin, according to Forrester
Research. As both markets grow, that margin is projected to fall to
3-1, with about 15 million customers for cable modems in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   But BellSouth does have some time: Forrester predicts that it
will be 2001 or 2002 before cable phone service nationally has more
than 1 million subscribers. BellSouth has more than 20 million
phone customers in its region.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bells face a dilemma, said Chris Mines, analyst with
Forrester: If they don't pour money into boosting their own
systems, customers in search of new services will abandon them. But
if they do invest what is needed, that could drain short-term
profits _ something that is awfully hard to explain on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, an announcement earlier this year about a net income
shortfall helped dampen BellSouth stock for months. To suffer less
from that kind of announcement, BellSouth could reshape its
corporate image among investors from one of a stodgy monopoly with
solid and predictable growth to a company spending aggressively to
compete in a shifting industry.
</P>
<P>
   Until AT&AMP;T entered the fray, the Bells had no incentive to move
fast, Mines said. ``Their core business is not under attack. There
are only a few thousand cable phone subscribers. But at the risk of
earnings growth and margin expansion, they have to invest now to
protect their core business that will be in danger five years from
now.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth recently announced a 10 percent investment in Qwest
Communications, a move that will give BellSouth a long-distance
company, once it is permitted into that market. Qwest also has
high-speed data services and a presence in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But is that enough? ``Not even close,'' Mines said. ``That helps
them with their plans to offer long-distance. This is a whole other
level of strategic challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   But Boren rejected the notion that BellSouth is vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   The company can spend millions improving its networks without
hurting earnings, because customers want the new services, he said.
``The deployment of broadband has accelerated beyond what any of us
anticipated 12 or 24 months ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Boren declined comment on reports that BellSouth might invest in
the merger of Deutsche Telekom and Telecom Italia. But he said the
alliance with Qwest gives BellSouth the reach it needs to serve
customers around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything you see BellSouth do is an attempt to come to your
home and sell you what you need to make your life easier and
better. The price goes to the company that is big enough to do
that, but small enough to provide individual good service.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth expects to be in long-distance within the year, a
change that would permit ``bundled'' offerings with the range of
services that customers want. And while $23 billion-a-year
BellSouth will be dwarfed by AT&AMP;T, Bell Atlantic, SBC and MCI
WorldCom, Boren brushed aside the idea that bigger is always
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be big enough _ but not any bigger.

 &HT;    MindSpring links with BellSouth to provide ADSL
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ MindSpring Enterprises said Wednesday it has entered
into an agreement with BellSouth that will allow it to provide
high-speed ADSL service to MindSpring subscribers in the nine-state
BellSouth service area.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based MindSpring is one of the largest Internet service
providers in the country, with 1.2 million subscribers. A
significant portion of those subscribers are in Atlanta and the
Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Anderson, MindSpring director of product management for fast
access, says the Internet provider will begin offering the service
in the early fall to MindSpring subscribers in the metro Atlanta
area. Other cities will follow. MindSpring will manage installation
and service to Atlanta households that are ADSL-ready.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said MindSpring isn't ready to announce pricing plans
for the high-speed service but promises competitive pricing.
BellSouth.net currently charges a monthly fee of $59.95 for its
high-speed service. BellSouth customers pay $49.95 monthly.
BellSouth.net charges a one-time installation fee of $199.95 to
configure computer and phone lines for ADSL service, and a one-time
service activation fee of $99.95.
</P>
<P>
   The ADSL service will be up to 200 times faster than a 28.8k bps
dial-up modem.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson cautions MindSpring subscribers that the company is at
the beginning of the ADSL process. ``Even then not every customer
will be eligible,'' he says. ``We are sensitive to the frustration
customers feel and we are going to do everything to move that
along,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The BellSouth deal is a giant step in MindSpring's battle for
access to so-called ``last mile'' phone and cable access from local
utilities to users' homes.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, MindSpring Chairman Charles Brewer openly expressed
his annoyance with BellSouth and other phone companies for offering
DSL at prices he considered outrageous and unreasonable. However,
since then, consumer demand for high-speed service has grown while
MindSpring has nearly doubled in size to become one of BellSouth's
biggest and best customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our size and the potential size of the service has led us to
really become a top tier customer of BellSouth for this service,''
says Michael McQuary, MindSpring president and chief operating
officer. ``We've always been one of their top customers, but with
some of the evolution in the last year, it has made us one of the
top providers of Internet service, and it's given us a better forum
to discuss what we need.''
</P>
<P>
   McQuary also says the aggressive moves by cable operators such
as AT&AMP;T and Time Warner to roll out cable modem service have forced
phone companies to rethink DSL deployment strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cable companies have really invested a lot of time and
money into showing that high-speed broadband Internet access over
the cable system is a reality. It's coming and it's made the
regional Bells take notice and gear up their own plans for
broadband.''
</P>
<P>
   McQuary says once the phone companies recognized the possibility
of cable owning the so-called ``last mile'' from the local provider
to users' homes, they worked to make sure their hardware is ready
and their service is offered at a consumer-acceptable price point
to make it a viable alternative to the cable offering.
</P>
<P>
   According to Herb Cash, vice president of marketing for
BellSouth business, the price for BellSouth's ADSL service hasn't
changed, but other things have.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is really ready for these kinds of service
offerings,'' he says. ``If anything has changed it's that we are
going aggressively toward the ISP customers.'' He also said that as
more people begin to use the Net, they'll want to upgrade their
service to the best of what's available. ``It's like anything else
_ you want to improve on it from a speed standpoint and from an
'always on' standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter Communications analyst Abhi Chaki says it's neither fear
of cable modems nor lower prices that's made BellSouth more willing
to do business with MindSpring and other ISPs. ``It's the law,'' he
says. ``They are required by law to open up their high-speed
services to ISPs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year they wanted to make as much money up front as they
could,'' Chaki says. ``They were making it too expensive for people
to resell the services. Now with its investment in DSL and its
efforts to ramp it up, BellSouth sees the advantage of wholesaling
ADSL to companies like MindSpring. The break-even mentality the
telecos typically operate on is a very anachronistic now.''

BOAT BUYERS NEED TO SHOP SMART
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEREMY BAGOTT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A fishing platform for targeting lunker bass. A
wet-tailed time-share for weekends on the Colorado. A
wind-propelled unit for family overnighters at the Channel Islands.
A kayak that can be strapped atop a subcompact.
</P>
<P>
   The right boat is out there for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   But boat buying can be a minefield. Many otherwise prudent
buyers have been swept away by the romance of boat ownership only
to find they have overpaid or overbought, purchasing vessels they
can barely afford.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boat'' doesn't have to stand for ``break out another
thousand,'' said David Goodner, an Oxnard-based yacht broker.
</P>
<P>
   Start small and trade up, he advises. And shop smart. The
following strategies can help you formulate your approach:
</P>
<P>
   Make a budget: For each $5,000 of boat at a 10 percent interest
rate on a 60-month loan, expect to pay $106.24 monthly. If you can
afford $200 a month, don't be tempted to take out a loan that will
have you paying the full amount in monthly payments.
</P>
<P>
   The payments will be only part of the equation, Goodner said.
``There will be equipment costs, repairs, launch fees, extra fuel,
insurance, registration and incidentals associated with the boat.''
</P>
<P>
   Monthly slip fees can run an additional $350; bottom cleaning
and maintenance can be $100 a month on larger boats.
</P>
<P>
   All could keep you high and dry if a budget has not been worked
out.
</P>
<P>
   Replace wish list with `needs' list: The savvy buyer will excise
all features he or she can do without. If an outboard will suffice,
rule out an inboard/outboard configuration. If you're a sailor and
don't absolutely need a spinnaker, do without it.
</P>
<P>
   That way the shopper is in a better position to look beyond the
little extras that can cloud judgment and promote an emotional
purchase. A budget and needs list will work in tandem to keep your
feet on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Consider a used boat: There are some people who only buy boats
new. These people are closely related to folks who only buy cars
new, and there's nothing wrong with it. It's just expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``A new boat may depreciate as much as 20 percent the moment it
leaves the showroom,'' said Oxnard-based yacht broker Burton Head,
who advises prospective owners to take a serious look at the used
market.
</P>
<P>
   If you are dead-set on buying a new boat, however, there is good
news: The value of a quality boat tends to stay flat for many years
after the initial depreciation.
</P>
<P>
   Size up the seller: Parties sell used boats for a variety of
reasons, but they can generally be pigeonholed into a few
categories:
</P>
<P>
   Those who have bought a vessel only to discover soon after that
boating wasn't for them. This seller will likely be trying to
recoup his investment as best he can and has little motivation to
reduce the price or sell quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Those who are trading up and have already made a deposit on a
bigger boat, a common scenario that signals a very motivated seller
and likely a craft kept in sound shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know the owner has a love for boating, since he's trading
up. This means he's probably taken very good care of the boat he's
selling,'' said Bart Hall, managing partner of Fred Hall Fishing,
Tackle and Boat Shows.
</P>
<P>
   Those who must sell because of a need for ready cash, often
because of a divorce or move. This, too, is generally a very
motivated seller.
</P>
<P>
   Consider paying cash: There's nothing that drags by more slowly
than the final six months on a 48-month boat loan. For a $10,000
used boat at a 10 percent annual interest rate on a 60-month loan,
the interest alone will total $2,748.80 over the full term. That
works out to a whopping 27 percent on the principal.
</P>
<P>
   Besides saving nearly $3,000 in interest payments, being able to
pay cash can help knock the price down.
</P>
<P>
   Insist on an inventory list: All sellers of boats _ from an
aluminum rowboat to a million-dollar luxury yacht _ should have an
inventory list. It's critical because it establishes what goes with
the boat and what doesn't, and that affects price. Such a list also
provides a basis for the buyer to check out the vessel's systems
and accessories.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we're showing a boat, it's not uncommon for (buyers) to
do their own mini-survey, especially on sailboats. The inventory
list is standard,'' said Goodner, who recommends that anyone
considering a purchase also employ a certified marine surveyor.
</P>
<P>
   Time the purchase of a new boat: ``Factories want to deliver to
dealers in September, October and November,'' Hall said. ``But
dealers don't really want to take them then. They would rather take
delivery in January, February and March,'' in time for the summer
boating season.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, Hall recommends, boaters may want to buy in late August
or early September to capitalize on the dealer's desire to move
last year's models out of the showroom to make room for new
models. &QL;

<P>
   Having cleared the way to become the nation's biggest cable
television company by acquiring Mediaone Group Inc., AT&AMP;T Corp. on
Wednesday moved closer to a partnership with Microsoft Corp., the
software giant. The whirlwind of deals surrounding AT&AMP;T raised
concerns in Washington and in many high-technology quarters about
the prospects for competition in the fast-growing communications
industry.
</P>
<P>
   With its cable and Microsoft deals, AT&AMP;T, which two years ago
appeared as a crippled giant, is poised to once again stand astride
the communications world. For Microsoft, a strong relationship with
AT&AMP;T could become the company's most important vehicle for
expanding from the arena of desktop computers and into a new world
in which millions of consumers use seamless bundles of telephone,
television and high-speed Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   But for regulators and competitors in industries ranging from
computers to telephones to Internet access, a partnership between
AT&AMP;T and Microsoft, which is still being negotiated, could appear
as frightening as it is formidable. AT&AMP;T's expansion into cable
television so quickly and broadly _ starting with its deal last
year to acquire Tele-Communications Inc., then the No. 2 cable
company _ raised concerns on its own.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, AT&AMP;T opened a path to acquire Mediaone, the No. 4
cable company, for $58 billion. To set up that deal, AT&AMP;T agreed to
sell up to 2 million of its existing cable subscribers to Comcast
Corp., which had made an earlier agreement to acquire Mediaone. In
exchange, Comcast agreed to withdraw its Mediaone bid and to offer
local telephone service over its cable lines in league with AT&AMP;T,
the nation's biggest telephone company.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft had earlier considered backing Comcast in a fight
against AT&AMP;T, but decided instead to try to form a partnership with
AT&AMP;T to use Microsoft's Windows operating system as part of AT&AMP;T's
cable-based communications system.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate antitrust subcommittee said Wednesday that it would
hold hearings into the competitive impact of AT&AMP;T's looming
acquisition of Mediaone. AT&AMP;T wants to use cable systems to offer
integrated bundles of telephone, television and high-speed Internet
service to millions of consumers. The subcommittee's leadership
said that AT&AMP;T's expansion into the cable business could speed the
advent of local telephone competition, but added that AT&AMP;T's
dealmaking might slow competition in video services.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal will likely increase AT&AMP;T's ability to provide
competitive local phone service to residential customers, which we
certainly support,'' Sen. Michael DeWine, R-Ohio, the
subcommittee's chairman, and Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., the ranking
minority member, said in a statement. ``But the jury is still out
on how it will affect the cable/video market and we need to closely
examine all of the competitive aspects of the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts decried AT&AMP;T's flurry of deals as good for all of
the companies involved, and the market supported that notion.
AT&AMP;T's shares rose, $5.375 on Wednesday, to $56.9375, while
Comcast's shares gained $9.1875, to $73.3125. Microsoft's shares
rose $1.0625, to $79.125. Mediaone's shares fell by 75 cents, to
$76.875, perhaps on disappointment that an extended bidding war for
the company appears highly unlikely. What clearly emerges from the
whirlwind of billion-dollar dealing is a sense that AT&AMP;T is putting
the pieces together to achieve a level of importance in the
communications landscape unmatched by any company since the old
American Telephone and Telegraph broke up under government pressure
in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the resurgent AT&AMP;T could become a major force in
promoting competition. That is because AT&AMP;T, with its cable lines
into millions of homes, has now become the biggest threat to the
Baby Bells' functional monopoly in offering local phone service to
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   None of the other long-distance giants has announced a
full-fledged plan to offer local phone service to residential
consumers, but AT&AMP;T has made offering local service in competition
with the Bells a cornerstone of its strategy.
</P>
<P>
   But because AT&AMP;T is moving so fast to gain links to U.S. homes,
and because of its legacy as the nation's telephone monopoly, any
strategic relationship it forges with Microsoft is bound to raise
eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   ``AT&AMP;T is putting together a cable monopoly that is beyond the
wildest dreams of John Malone,'' said Gregory C. Simon, co-director
of Open Net Coalition, a group that includes many of AT&AMP;T's
competitors _ including America Online and Mindspring in Internet
service and MCI Worldcom in long distance _ and a former domestic
policy adviser to Vice President Al Gore. ``And now that they have
cornered the network, they are putting the network under lock and
key by putting Microsoft technology inside the set-top box.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft dominates the market for personal computer software.
But its main objective in dealing with AT&AMP;T was to obtain assured
access for its software and Internet commerce businesses _ and
preferred access, if possible _ to the fast-growing high-speed data
network that AT&AMP;T is assembling.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal being negotiated between AT&AMP;T and
Microsoft, Microsoft will invest about $5 billion in AT&AMP;T, perhaps
in exchange for some sort of preferred stock in AT&AMP;T. AT&AMP;T would
also agree to use Microsoft's software in its integrated packages
of voice, video and data service.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T is adamant that Microsoft will not get an exclusive
arrangement to supply its Windows CE software on the set-top boxes
of AT&AMP;T's expanded network. But Microsoft is negotiating hard to
get AT&AMP;T to agree to allow its Windows CE software to be rolled out
in at least one large cable market run by AT&AMP;T, as an early proving
ground for Microsoft's set-top box technology, according to people
close to the talks.
</P>
<P>
   For Microsoft, a $5 billion investment is a fairly conservative
hedge against the uncertain future represented by so-called
broadband networks, in which households are continuously connected
to high-speed data lines.
</P>
<P>
   These broadband networks _ whether built by cable companies,
regional phone companies or wireless operators _ are expected to
stream video, audio and text into people's homes, everything from
movies-on-demand to e-mail. And users will tap into this rich flow
of information and entertainment using various equipment, from
Internet-enabled televisions to handheld devices. It is seen as a
world of diverse information appliances, and all of them will need
software.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft wants to compete in that market against traditional
makers of cable television equipment, including General Instrument
Corp. and Scientific-Atlanta Inc. Before being acquired by AT&AMP;T,
TCI had agreed to use Java software from Sun Microsystems Inc. in
its advanced set-top boxes. Executives close to the negotiations
said that agreement would not be affected by AT&AMP;T's looming deal
with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   To bring the United States to this broadband future, the cable
industry, including AT&AMP;T, is locked in a battle against the Baby
Bells, GTE and the rest of the local phone industry. As that
inter-industry fight intensifies, and as AT&AMP;T becomes a unifying
force in the cable business, some of the rivalries that had
traditionally divided cable operators may soon disappear.
</P>
<P>
   In acquiring Mediaone, AT&AMP;T will also get a 25 percent stake in
some of Time Warner's cable systems, its HBO cable network and its
Warner Brothers movie studio.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   Time Warner, which has bickered incessantly with Mediaone on a
number of issues, sat on the sidelines as Comcast and AT&AMP;T jockeyed
for Mediaone, rooting simply for one of the deals to occur. Even
though AT&AMP;T's victory creates a bigger rival for its cable systems,
Time Warner benefits by eliminating Mediaone's influence over its
cable and movie units.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pleased with the outcome and pleased with the role Brian
Roberts played in bringing the companies together with a solution
that benefits the cable industry,'' Gerald Levin, Time Warner's
chairman, said in a prepared statement, referring to Comcast's
president.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner is likely to try to create accords with AT&AMP;T on a
number of fronts, according to media executives. It hopes to find a
way to buy control back of HBO and Warner Brothers. In return, it
will likely look for ways for Road Runner, the high-speed Internet
service in which it is a shareholder, to cooperate with At Home, a
comparable service in which AT&AMP;T is the leading shareholder. The
services could be merged out right, or they could be linked more
closely using compatible technology. As part of this, Time Warner
is likely to complete its planed venture to offer local telephone
service through its cable systems in cooperation with AT&AMP;T. The
deal, announced in February, was being delayed by Mediaone,
executives said.
</P>
<P>
   But just as the cable industry rallies around AT&AMP;T and At Home,
the biggest player in the Internet market today _ America Online _
is notably excluded from the party.
</P>
<P>
   For now, America Online plans to offer high speed services using
a technology that uses telephone lines rather than cable wires. It
already has agreements with Bell Atlantic and SBC communications
and is courting the other local phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   America Online is also eager to have access to cable systems as
well and considered backing Comcast in an effort to outbid AT&AMP;T for
Mediaone, but ultimately decided the deal was an expensive way to
get into a business that is growing much slower than its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, we are a pure Internet Company, said
Robert Pittman, America Online's president. ``We used to be in the
data transport business and we got out of it,'' he said.

STEELE WANTED TO SELL INFORMATION TO TABLOIDS, WILLEY TESTIFIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALEXANDRIA, Va. _ Kathleen E. Willey testified Wednesday that
she had repeatedly told her former friend, Julie Hiatt Steele,
about an unwelcome sexual encounter with President Clinton at the
White House in November 1993, and that Ms. Steele had offered to
corroborate the story and help sell it to a tabloid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not give her all the gory details, but I told her what
happened in the Oval Office,'' Ms. Willey told a federal jury here
at the obstruction of justice trial of Ms. Steele, who is being
prosecuted by the office of independent counsel Kenneth Starr. ``We
talked about what had happened there; many, many times.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ms. Willey, a former White House volunteer, told jurors that
in March 1997, Ms. Steele had offered to corroborate her account in
an interview with Michael Isikoff, a reporter from Newsweek
magazine. ``She offered _ I did not ask _ that she would be more
than happy to corroborate what happened,'' Ms. Willey testified.
``Julie wanted to be in this story.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Ms. Willey said, her friend was motivated by money, and
hoped to help sell the story to a tabloid to establish ``an
education fund'' for her young son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her I had no intention of going to a tabloid for any
amount of money,'' Ms. Willey said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Steele contends she never heard about Ms. Willey's encounter
with Clinton until 1997, when Ms. Willey asked her to corroborate
her account in the March interview with Isikoff.
</P>
<P>
   And in a contentious cross-examination session Wednesday, Eric
Dubelier, one of Ms. Steele's lawyers, tried to raise questions
about Ms. Willey's truthfulness and her motives in telling the
story to Starr's prosecutors and to the CBS News program ``60
Minutes'' in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Dubelier pointed out that during her January 1998
deposition in Paula Corbin Jones' sexual misconduct lawsuit against
the president, Ms. Willey failed to recall precisely where the
president had touched her.
</P>
<P>
   Dubelier made the point that Ms. Willey said ``I don't recall''
or ``I don't remember'' 63 times during her deposition on Jan. 10,
1998. Ms. Willey answered, ``I can't remember'' when she was asked
if the president was ``successful in kissing you.''
</P>
<P>
   In her testimony Tuesday, Ms. Willey provided a far more
detailed description of the incident she said occurred on Nov. 29,
1993. She told jurors that the president was ``very forceful'' and
that ``his hands were all over me.'' And several friends of Ms.
Willey have testified that she had told them Clinton had given her
``a big old kiss.''
</P>
<P>
   The president, in his grand jury testimony last August, denied
making a sexual advance on Ms. Willey.
</P>
<P>
   The trial of Ms. Steele marks the first and only criminal
prosecution arising from Starr's lengthy investigation of Clinton's
affair with Monica Lewinsky that led to the president's impeachment
and subsequent acquittal. The trial is clearly a top priority for
Starr, who had six members of his office sitting behind two
prosecution tables Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In their opening statement on Monday, prosecutors told the jury
that Ms. Steele, in an attempt to ally herself with the president,
had lied when she refused to corroborate Ms. Willey's account.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted of obstruction of justice and giving false
statements to investigators and two grand juries, Ms. Steele faces
a maximum of 35 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   For 20 years, Ms. Steele and Ms. Willey were very close friends
in Richmond, Va., but their deep animosity for each other over the
last two years was on display for the jury. Several times, Ms.
Willey stared angrily at Ms. Steele, who sat just several feet from
the witness stand.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Willey was asked to describe a confrontation with Ms. Steele
at a supermarket in Richmond over Easter weekend last month. Ms.
Willey acknowledged that she used an epithet toward Ms. Steele.

 Nat Semi Exiting Microchip Business
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Dan Fost &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Succumbing to pressure from Intel Corp., National Semiconductor
Corp. is getting out of the microchip business and laying off 550
people, including 180 at its Santa Clara headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The move will cost the company as much as $300 million and
represents a black eye for National chief executive Brian Halla,
who bought Texas chipmaker Cyrix Corp. in 1997 for $540 million.
</P>
<P>
   As Cyrix chips helped pioneer the sale of cheap computers, Halla
crowed that he had found a niche in the market that could be safe
from Intel.
</P>
<P>
   But after some initial stumbles, Intel revved up its engine for
making low-cost chips and quickly attacked National and Advanced
Micro Devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were thinking that Intel wouldn't have the stomach for
those kinds of prices,'' Halla said in an interview yesterday.
``Not only did they go aggressively after the market, but they
quickly took away the market share we had taken from them.''
</P>
<P>
   Halla, who once worked for Intel, hadn't counted on Intel's
strategy of ``market segmentation,'' in which the company's
tremendous profits in selling expensive chips for corporate servers
and workstations help subsidize sales of its low-end Celeron chips.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Dave Tremblay of InfoBeads, a Ziff-Davis market research
firm, said Halla shouldn't have been surprised. ``Intel had to get
aggressive at the low end,'' he said. ``They couldn't let AMD or
Cyrix go unchallenged there.''
</P>
<P>
   Microprocessors _ often called the brains of personal computers
_ account for only 10 percent of National's sales. The company
makes most of its money _ about 70 percent _ from selling products
such as amplifiers based on its analog technology and the rest of
its money comes from chips sold for cellular phones, networking
devices and other products.
</P>
<P>
   Without microprocessors, Halla said, he's still pinning his
hopes on ``information appliances'' such as television set-top
boxes and stand-alone computers that connect to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   While that vision may yet come to pass, Halla has paid a price
for his early investments in such products.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hard part of being a visionary is not just seeing the
future, but knowing when it's going to happen,'' said Linley
Gwennap, editor of the Microprocessor Report, an industry
newsletter. ``It's surprising to me that the board (of directors)
is still standing behind him, given how much his strategy is
unraveling.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, National posted a net loss of $98 million on sales of
$2.5 billion. The company said unloading its microprocessors will
lead to returned profitability by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street cheered the news, sending National's stock up $3.06
to close at $17.69, its biggest one-day gain since November 1990.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear who would end up with Cyrix or how
much they would pay. Rumors had been rife within the industry that
International Business Machines was interested, although some
analysts questioned why IBM would want to compete directly with
Intel.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, National's challenge in selling the microprocessor
business is to find anyone willing to compete with Intel, the
world's largest maker of computer chips.
</P>
<P>
   ``There just aren't a lot of companies that want to go and
charge the Intel hill,'' Gwennap said. He cited one possibility:
the German firm SGS Thompson, which makes similar microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, said Dan Briody, an editor at InfoWorld, ``A lot of
people wonder why someone would buy a dying company.''
</P>
<P>
   Halla said prospective buyers are now kicking the tires, but he
wouldn't name names. Gwennap said a large Japanese or Korean
company would ordinarily make a strong suitor, but those firms
aren't capable of a large acquisition because of the economic
situation in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   National isn't putting all of Cyrix on the market, only the
microprocessor part of the business, which is based in Richardson,
Texas. Halla said National also plans to keep a minority interest
in the chip fabrication plant that it built in South Portland,
Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The move caps a rough year at National, one of the oldest
semiconductor companies in Silicon Valley. In July, it asked its
13,000 employees to take off 10 days, either as vacation or without
pay. That belt-tightening came on the heels of the layoff of 1,400
workers, including 560 in Santa Clara.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 550 job cuts announced yesterday, 180 will be at the
company's development factory in Santa Clara, leaving about 120
people working in that facility. Another 165 workers in Singapore
will be laid off, with the other cuts spread to other National
sites.
</P>
<P>
   National's retreat from the business comes just two months after
Intel settled government charges that it violates antitrust laws.
Although National's exit leaves only AMD as a significant
competitor, analysts didn't see enough of a marketplace change to
warrant government scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it hard to compete with Intel? Yes. But does that make them
anticompetitive? That would be very hard to prove,'' said analyst
Drew Peck at SG Cowen &AMP; Co. ``Nothing has changed except National
has decided to cut bait.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwennap noted that National controlled only about 3 percent of
the worldwide chip market.

 Devices Put the World in Your Palm
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Deborah Solomon &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
The next time you're on vacation and trying to find the way to your
hotel, you may pull out your cell phone or electronic organizer
instead of a map.
</P>
<P>
   A slew of companies are developing services that provide
directions, emergency help, maps _ even the location of the closest
Starbuck's _ for mobile phones and personal digital assistants.
</P>
<P>
   Within the next year, customers will be able to buy phones and
PDAs (personal digital assistants, such as a PalmPilot or a Windows
CE-based Palm-size PC) that can pinpoint a caller's exact location.
By using satellites or cellular signals, the devices will be able
to ``know'' where they are.
</P>
<P>
   When a phone or PDA is turned on, software inside the device and
at a central network can sense where the phone is located. Some
phones and PDAs may display a map showing where you are, others
will have an operator or voice system that can relay your exact
position.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with that information, cellular carriers and other
companies want to offer consumers a way to find their favorite
haunts while on the road. With a single phone call or click of a
button, business travelers and vacationers will soon be able to
find the nearest ATM, taco joint or Marriott.
</P>
<P>
   That information could be relayed on the screen of the cell
phone or on the PDA. It could also be given to the caller by an
operator or a voice-activated system.
</P>
<P>
   Most cellular carriers plan to offer these wireless location
services over the next few years, and some organizers, such as the
PalmPilot, already have some of the capability.
</P>
<P>
   The Strategis Group, a research firm in Washington, D.C.,
projects that cell phone companies will spend more than $2 billion
on location technologies over the next five years. Most of that
money is being spent to meet federal requirements, which mandate
that wireless carriers be able to tell the location of a 911 call
by October 2001.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 69 million people already carrying a mobile phone
and several million more with PDAs, the market has a lot of
potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``As people become increasingly untethered, they want
information about &LR;   &LR; the area they are in at the moment they are in
it,'' said Ellen Kirk, vice president of SnapTrack, a San Jose
company that help wireless carriers pinpoint a caller's location.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody needs a tow truck, they want to be able to get one
for the area they are calling from. If they need flowers, they want
to find a flower shop a few streets away.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirk's San Jose company has developed software that can help
achieve that. SnapTrack's software locates where a call is being
made by using technology based on Global Positioning Satellites or
GPS. When a caller turns on his or her cell phone, SnapTrack's
software pinpoints the location of the caller.
</P>
<P>
   SnapTrack has agreements with several wireless manufacturers,
including Motorola, which plans to embed SnapTrack's technology
into its wireless phones.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies, such as Palo Alto's Vicinity Corp. and
Boulder's SignalSoft, are creating databases of shops, banks,
hotels and other businesses that road warriors may want to find.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're in New Orleans, for example, and want to find the
nearest Cajun restaurant, you just push a button on your phone and
we provide that information,'' said David Hose, president of
SignalSoft.
</P>
<P>
   The company is still negotiating agreements with various
wireless carriers, but expects that several companies will soon
offer the ability to access SignalSoft's database from a cell
phone.
</P>
<P>
   Companies such as Sprint PCS say they plan to offer location
services as early as this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The company believes that customers would like ``to have a
certain amount of information at their fingertips tailored to their
specific needs,'' said Tom Murphy, a spokesman for Sprint PCS.
</P>
<P>
   He said customers can already get some localized information by
dialing 411 on their Sprint PCS phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're in Knoxville and want to know what's showing at the
movie theater today, you can dial 411 and we'll get you that
information,'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   But the new suite of services will go a step further by giving
directions to the theater and possibly even ordering tickets for
the customer in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies, such as 3Com's PalmPilot division, are
providing the information via electronic organizers.
</P>
<P>
   At least one third-party vendor already provides a GPS system
for the PalmPilot. DeLorme offers a product called the Earthmate
GPS Receiver, which allows Palm users to download maps and routing
directions. Palm users can track their location on the device as
they move about a city.
</P>
<P>
   When the Palm VII is rolled out nationwide this fall, it will
include Web-browsing capabilities that will let users access
MapQuest to find directions, and Visa and MasterCard's Web sites to
find the nearest ATMs. However, the Palm VII won't have a built-in
locator system. Users will have to add a GPS product or punch in a
ZIP code to find location-specific information.
</P>
<P>
   One reason the cell phone and PDA companies are branching into
the wireless location market is the amount of money to be made, say
industry experts. The costs of the service has not been determined,
but most industry watchers predict carriers will charge between $5
and $10 per month for location-specific information.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the largest markets to serve is the business traveler
or the vacation traveler,'' said Albert Lin, who follows the
wireless industry for the Abernathy Group in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   But the cell phone carriers are actually being forced by federal
regulators to provide the location-specific information.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission requires that by October
2001, cell phone carriers be able to identify a caller's location
when they dial 911. Cell phone companies will need to pinpoint
within 125 meters where a 911 call was made in order to route
callers to the closest emergency 911 center and locate the caller
if they've been in an accident or need immediate help.
</P>
<P>
   The companies are doing this by using GPS, technology such as
SnapTrack's or by gauging where a person's call is coming from
based on which cellular towers are picking up the call.
</P>
<P>
   Installing the technology is an expensive process that the
carriers originally balked at, but they've come to realize that
location-based information can be used to their advantage, Lin
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FCC goes as far as saying they recognize this is a huge
commercial opportunity for the carriers,'' Lin said. ``This is a
billion-dollar opportunity for companies. Being able to know the
location of a person is great for advertisers.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, companies like SignalSoft and Vicinity have already
lined up a slew of companies to participate in their shared
database. Their listings may include some of the biggest
corporations, such as Hilton Hotels, Federal Express and Pizza Hut.
Eventually, customers who want to find an ATM or hotel will be able
to punch ATM or HOTEL on their phone and get a listing of the
closest ones.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of providing travel directions and information is not
new. General Motors has been giving driving instructions and
roadside assistance through its OnStar system, which is installed
in 31 brands of GM cars.
</P>
<P>
   OnStar uses a GPS system to track the vehicle and has a call
center where customers can get driving instructions, a listing of
the closest restaurants and other information. The company has
about 60,000 customers and charges about $25 a month.
</P>
<P>
   But while OnStar is helpful within a car, the selling point of
the new products is that they are mobile, said Andrew Cole, a
principal with Renaissance Worldwide in Boston. However, these
locator services won't sell a phone or PDA, Cole said. They are
more of an add-on feature, like voice mail or call waiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within a bundle of services, this will be attractive,'' Cole
said. ``Concierge services are the icing on the cake.''

 H&AMP;Q Chief Says IPO Fees Are Likely to Fall
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Sam Zuckerman &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Hambrecht &AMP; Quist chief executive Daniel Case, whose San Francisco
firm is one of more than a dozen investment banks hit by a federal
probe of possible fee-fixing for initial public stock offerings,
said those costs are likely to fall as competition among
underwriters heats up.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Case declined to comment on a Justice
Department antitrust investigation of whether securities firms
fixed fees for taking companies public.
</P>
<P>
   Justice last week said it was looking into whether investment
banks engage in ``anticompetitive practices'' in deciding how much
to charge companies for selling newly issued stock to the public.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, though, Case said stiffer competition will
force down fees as new players such as banks and Internet
underwriters enter the IPO arena. He compared the situation to
retail stock brokerage, where the growth of discount firms pushed
commissions down.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at all transactions in financial services, there
is downward pricing pressure,'' Case said. ``IPO fees are no
exception.''
</P>
<P>
   Case was one of the first securities industry CEOs to comment on
IPO fees since the Justice probe came to light.
</P>
<P>
   Companies paid underwriters a fee of exactly 7 percent in more
than 90 percent of midsize IPOs in recent years, according to a
study by Jay Ritter, a University of Florida finance professor, and
a colleague.
</P>
<P>
   At H&AMP;Q, that charge was virtually set in stone. In all but two
of the 56 IPOs the firm led or co-managed in 1998 and 1999, issuers
paid a 7 percent fee, according to CommScan, a New York firm that
tracks securities offerings.
</P>
<P>
   While the 7 percent level may look solid, some investment banks
are undercutting the standard by picking up costs traditionally
borne by the issuer, Case said. For example, some underwriters are
now willing to pay for travel by company officials to meet with
potential investors.
</P>
<P>
   H&AMP;Q's chief said a trend is also emerging to give issuers a menu
of options with different fees.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional, full-service IPOs will carry a full fee, while
bare-bones offerings with fewer underwriters may cost less, Case
said. The cheapest alternative may be IPOs transacted entirely over
the Internet and managed by a new breed of all-electronic
underwriters.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the fees collected by individual underwriters have
been falling ``for a long time,'' Case said.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the 7 percent IPO fee must be divided among more
investment banks as the average number of IPO co-managers has been
edging up in recent years. Stock issuers are demanding more
co-managers to ensure that their shares are sold as widely as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   University of California at Los Angeles finance professor Ivo
Welch, a specialist in IPOs, countered that the amount individual
firms get is irrelevant to the fee-fixing question.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the perspective of an antitrust investigator, I would not
be concerned about how much each underwriter gets, but at how much
underwriters get in total,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Case said he expected H&AMP;Q's profits to hold up even as
underwriting fees shrink because the firm will increase the number
of IPOs it manages, though he noted the IPO market experiences
sharp swings in volume.
</P>
<P>
   In the quarter that ended March 31, H&AMP;Q reported earnings of
$25.8 million, up 62 percent from the first quarter of 1998, as the
number of IPOs it led or co-managed jumped 50 percent. ``Volume has
been exploding while unit-pricing has been going down,'' Case said.
</P>
<P>
   Case and Welch agreed that issuers worry less about the fees
they pay for IPOs than creating a buzz in the marketplace and
getting strong demand for their stock from investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like paying for your daughter's wedding,'' said Case.
``You don't want to be cheated, but you don't focus primarily on
what it costs. You just want everything to go well.''

WHAT BOAT SELLERS DON'T TELL YOU
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEREMY BAGOTT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Jack Tyler wishes he had understood the concept of
dealer ``flooring'' (begin ital)before(end ital) he bought two new
boats years ago.
</P>
<P>
   A flooring cost is a fee the dealer pays the manufacturer for
taking delivery of a boat to be displayed on the lot. This gives
the dealer a chance to show many models without having to actually
buy them. A flooring cost of about $40 per month per $10,000 of
boat is typically paid _ and figured into the dealer's overhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the boat dealer is allowed X amount of capital or feels he
can afford no more, then that defines the inventory he can put on
his floor,'' said Tyler, a St. Petersburg, Fla., boater who has
researched the topic extensively. ``The more expensive the models
he selects, the fewer he can show. Or the more low-end the models
he selects, the harder to demo the big boys.''
</P>
<P>
   The typical buyer will look at a showroom model for
demonstration purposes, but, when buying, will put a deposit on a
yet-to-be-built boat. This costs the dealer next to nothing. When
the buyer's boat arrives, it is commissioned for some time in the
yard, where it can be viewed by other potential buyers without
tying up any flooring capital for the dealer.
</P>
<P>
   The boater may be better served by waiting until boating season
ends, when the dealer might be more willing to bargain if his
showroom models haven't sold. At that point, he may have to prolong
the financing arrangement with the builder, or even buy the
demonstration boat outright _ something the dealer (begin
ital)really(end ital) doesn't want to do. This is when a good deal
can be made.
</P>
<P>
   To determine when a showroom model was built _ and how long the
dealer has probably been sitting on it _ look at the hull
identification number on the transom; the month and year of
manufacture are found in the last four numbers.

 Column: Tech Journalists Scramble to Get on
Magazine's  Most-Powerful List 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Dan Fost &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
This month, Jeff O'Brien is the hottest lunch date in town.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien edits the San Francisco magazine Marketing Computers,
and the next issue will feature the sixth annual ``Influencers
List,'' ranking the most powerful technology journalists.
</P>
<P>
   He probably should put himself on the list. Editors, reporters,
columnists, chief executives and their flacks are all calling,
e-mailing, wining and dining the 29-year-old career-maker to get on
the list, which quickly has taken on power beyond its origins.
</P>
<P>
   Some journalists have told O'Brien that their raises and bonuses
depend, at least in part, on their ranking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of lunches I have with high-powered editors ramps
straight up in the months before I publish this list,'' O'Brien
says. ``My floor is covered with reams of articles they've
written.''
</P>
<P>
   I met O'Brien at a schmooze-fest sponsored by the editors of PC
Week magazine at the swanky restaurant Shanghai 1930 in the
Financial District.
</P>
<P>
   Sharing a table with reporters from the New York Times, the Wall
Street Journal, USA Today, Bloomberg News and Reuters, we munched
on crispy Peking duck wrapped in steamed buns, and O'Brien told how
the list originated as a service to his core readers, the high-tech
public relations industry.
</P>
<P>
   Those people still tape it to their cubicle walls, but ``it's
taken on a life of its own,'' O'Brien says. ``It garners as much
attention from the media as it does from the PR people.''
</P>
<P>
   By its nature, the list wounds some egos, and many people find
fault with O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I was outrightly accused of sexism and of ignoring
whole publishing companies because of some vendetta against them,''
O'Brien says. ``I get calls asking me for career advice: `Am I at
the wrong publication? How can I get on the list?'''
</P>
<P>
   It's a lot of attention for a magazine that's only six years
old, with a free circulation of about 25,000. Marketing Computers
is a division of New York's Adweek magazine, which is part of BPI
Communications (publishers of Billboard magazine), which itself is
owned by the Dutch publishing conglomerate VNU.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien compiles the list through as many objective criteria as
he can find _ circulation of a publication, number of speaking
engagements of a journalist, how often they're quoted in other
media. But there also are intangible factors, such as if the
journalist in question was among an elite handful invited to Bill
Gates' house.
</P>
<P>
   One name has topped the list every year since its inception:
Walter Mossberg, the personal technology columnist for the Wall
Street Journal. O'Brien won't tell who's on this year's list, but
he tells how last year Mossberg nearly didn't make it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a heart attack and was not writing for three or four
months,'' O'Brien recalls. ``There was a lot of speculation that I
was going to bump him down. I thought long and hard about it. As
powerful as the people below him (on the list) are, given his
circulation and the power he wields, it's very difficult to knock
him out of the top spot.''
</P>
<P>
   The list will be out in the June issue, in mailboxes around May
24.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the bane of my existence, and at the same time, it's a
high-profile, fun and interesting thing that draws attention to the
magazine,'' O'Brien says. ``It's a bittersweet experience.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; SILENT SALON: &LR;  Nothing like kicking someone when they can't defend
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's Salon.com, muzzled by a federally mandated
``quiet period'' while it plans its public stock offering, is under
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Byron, whose piece for the New York Observer was
reprinted in Sunday's San Francisco Examiner, praised Salon for its
fine writing and reportage but slammed the online magazine's
pending initial public offering as a dubious investment.
</P>
<P>
   Fair enough. Byron routinely turns his acerbic tongue toward
Internet IPOs. But the barb that must really sting came from
Michael Kinsley, editor of Microsoft's media foray Slate, Salon's
direct competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Kinsley deftly lifted passages from Salon's filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission and compared them with public
statements during the past few years from Salon's founder, Chairman
and Editor-in-Chief David Talbot.
</P>
<P>
   Talbot didn't fare well in the comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Kinsley cited a Newsweek story published in September.
Newsweek's Steven Levy wrote: ``Talbot says that though revenues
are up ($6 million for this year), profits won't come until 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Gotcha. Kinsley points to the prospectus to show that Salon
couldn't possibly have brought in even $3 million in 1998, and that
instead of profitability in 1999, losses will continue ``for the
foreseeable future.''
</P>
<P>
   The piece _ posted as one of Kinsley's regular Read Me columns
at  &LR; www.slate.com &LR;  _ continues in that vein, pointing out
conflicting statements on the number of advertisers and of paid
subscribers, and on what Salon charges for ads.
</P>
<P>
   Kinsley's caustic conclusion: ``The only logical explanation is
typographical errors in the prospectus.''
</P>
<P>
   Salon declined to comment on the Kinsley report. My efforts to
cajole technology editor and Vice President Scott Rosenberg into a
reaction were fruitless. ``We can't say anything about it,''
Rosenberg said. ``I cannot say a word.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because the SEC frowns on public comments about pending
stock offerings
</P>
<P>
   So I can only guess what Salon thinks. And here's a guess: It's
Kinsley's revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Salon hasn't been kind to Kinsley over the years, most savagely
last July. That's when a Kinsley memo leaked out in which he
described how S.I. Newhouse offered him the editor's job at the New
Yorker and then withdrew the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Salon not only questioned Kinsley's account, calling his tale
``a weirdly convoluted and self-lacerating hoax,'' but it also
published a parody by Daniel Radosh of Kinsley's memo. The parody
referred to Kinsley's columns as ``stunned mumbling'' and indicated
that his memo killed any hope Kinsley ``still had left of ever
getting a job at a real magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   Contacted by telephone, Kinsley said he did not recall reading
Salon's skewering of him _ though he said, ``I'm sure I read it'' _
and that he wasn't writing out of bitterness. He also wasn't trying
to poke Salon just because of the SEC gag. ``When else would I do
it?'' he asked. ``I couldn't do it before the IPO'' was announced.
</P>
<P>
   If Salon's IPO reaches the financial stratosphere of other Net
stocks, should we look for a Slate IPO soon thereafter?
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope not,'' Kinsley said. ``I like staying close to mom and
dad.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; SPEAKING OF REAL MAGAZINES: &LR;  In a news story last month on Salon's
IPO, I unfairly tweaked the Atlantic Monthly for not having ``a
significant online presence.''
</P>
<P>
   Shame on me. Just because it's 141 years old doesn't mean it
can't be a feisty Web zine.
</P>
<P>
   Wen Stephenson, editorial director for New Media for the
Atlantic Monthly, set me straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure what Mr. Fost considers a `significant' online
presence, but perhaps he is not aware that the Atlantic's Web site,
Atlantic Unbound ( &LR; www.theatlantic.com &LR; ) _ which was launched in
October 1995 (one month before Salon and eight months before Slate)
_ has been nominated twice for the National Magazine Award for
General Excellence in New Media, has been named by both PC Magazine
and P.O.V. magazine as one of the Top 100 sites on the Web (one of
the few print-magazine sites to gain that distinction) and is
widely considered one of the Internet's premier literary and
political sites. Furthermore, 50 percent of the editorial content
of Atlantic Unbound is exclusive to the Web, making it a competitor
to online magazines such as Slate and Salon.''
</P>
<P>
   He's absolutely right.

 Ways to Speed Up Your Web Surfing
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By David Einstein &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I recently saw a piece about speeding up Web surfing as
well as overall system performance by cleaning out old, unused
files. It mentioned deleting old program installation files, which
I assume are only used once when you install a program. It also
suggested cleaning out the Internet cache folder. How do I identify
these without deleting something I'll need later?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  Unless you've installed dozens of programs, getting
rid of old installation files probably won't boost your system's
performance. But you might get a lift from emptying the browser's
cache folder, which can accumulate hundreds of little files over
time (these files are used to speed up the loading of Web pages
you've previously visited).
</P>
<P>
   Here's how to empty the cache: If you're using Internet
Explorer, choose Internet Options from the Tools menu. In the
section labeled Temporary Internet files, click Delete Files. If
you're using Netscape Navigator, choose Preferences from the Edit
menu. Click the plus mark next to Advanced in the directory on the
left. Choose Cache and then click the button labeled Clear Disk
Cache.
</P>
<P>
   Decoding MIME
</P>
<P>
   Q: I hope you can help: What does it mean when someone sends me
an attachment that I download, only to find it is a ``multipart
mime message''? I've tried various programs to open (Notebook,
Word, Excel) only to find Greek symbols instead of English text. I
have America Online.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: I know the feeling, because I had the same experience
over the weekend with some photos that someone sent to my AOL
account. AOL's Help section claims that ``When you receive a
MIME-encoded attached file from an Internet address, the AOL
software will decode the file for you _ invisibly and
automatically.'' WRONG!
</P>
<P>
   I had the photos resent to another e-mail account and was able
to download them just fine using Outlook Express.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of MIME is to ensure that files can be sent over the
Internet and opened at the other end. But obviously that doesn't
always work with AOL. To decipher your files, you'll need a program
that can decode MIME. Two that come to mind are Winzip, a $29
shareware program that also happens to be great for compressing
files; and Wincode, which is free. Both can be downloaded from
 &LR; www.hotfiles.com. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   No Upgrade
</P>
<P>
   Q: I use Microsoft Exchange 4.0 for e-mail. It came on my
computer nearly three years ago. Is there a free upgrade for this
program? If not, what alternatives are there?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: There is no upgrade for the consumer version of Exchange,
which is no longer being shipped with Windows. But several free
e-mail programs are available that might suit you. If you want to
stick with Microsoft, try Outlook Express, which comes with the
Internet Explorer browser. You can download it for free at &LR; 
www.microsoft.com/ie. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Another option is the Netscape Messenger, an e-mail client that
comes as part of Netscape Communicator. Also free, it can be
downloaded at  &LR; www.netscape.com. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Those are the Big Two, but there also are a couple of other
terrific free e-mail programs out there. One is Eudora Light from
Qualcomm, which you can get at &LR;  www.eudora.com.  &LR; The other is
Pegasus Mail, which is available at &LR;  www.pegasus.usa.com. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Keeping Addresses
</P>
<P>
   Q: I can't find any file in America Online 4.0 dedicated to my
list of e-mail addresses. AOL 3.0 had such a list called
addrbk.lst. I just had a hard drive crash and had no backup for the
address list and am slowly recovering one name at a time. Is there
a way I can back up my address book?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: Indeed there is. AOL stores your addresses in a file that
has the same name as your screen name. You'll find it in the
Organize folder inside the America Online folder on your hard disk.
To back up the file, simply save it to another place on your hard
drive, or to a floppy or Zip disk.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, the storage file also contains your Favorite Places
bookmarks, so you can also back them up by saving the file.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; TIP OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  You work at a company that doesn't let you access your corporate
e-mail when you're out of the office. Maybe they're paranoid, or
maybe they just don't have a way to get you around the firewall.
But if you use Microsoft Outlook at work, and your company uses
Microsoft Exchange, there is a way. Just set up a message rule that
forwards copies of your e-mail to another address _ either an
Internet account you have at home, or maybe a free Web-based e-mail
service like Hotmail.
</P>
<P>
   With your Outlook Inbox open, go to the Tools menu and choose
Rules Wizard. The wizard will guide you through the process of
setting up a rule that automatically forwards messages for you.

   MOORE, Okla. _ Tom Chase had been following the tornado for
about 90 minutes on television, watching the little map in the
bottom corner of the screen as it traced the twister's chewing path
across central Oklahoma to the edge of his middle-class
neighborhood a few miles south of Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, we had plenty of warning, plenty,'' said the 77-year-old
retired fighter pilot. ``We were able to follow the whole thing on
television. Finally, we could hear it outside. I walked out on the
front porch and there it was, black and twirling, all this debris
spinning up in the sky.''
</P>
<P>
   Chase and his wife, Mary, scurried down into the underground
shelter that her father had built in the 1960s to protect them from
nuclear bombs. Soon, they were joined by their next door neighbor,
the people across the street, 11 souls in all, huddled in a
10-by-10 foot room that, as the tornado passed almost directly
overhead, began to throb and pulse like a heart in palpitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was one big crack and the house was gone above us,'' he
said. ``We heard it coming apart. Just crack, and it was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   All up and down Chase's block in the Highland Park section of
Moore, which took some of the hardest wallops from Monday's
tornado, and in similarly hit areas across the southern and eastern
edges of Oklahoma City, almost everyone seemed to have been
watching the storm on television.
</P>
<P>
   Pansy Harjo, who lived on a house around the corner from the
Chases, said they broke into the movie she was watching on a
pay-cable channel. ``That's when I knew it was a serious
situation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Oklahoma City on Wednesday, as more and more residents were
allowed to venture back into their neighborhoods to salvage what
they could from the surreal debris, it became jarringly clear to
everyone that many, many more people could easily have died in
Monday's killer storm. Instead, the death toll Wednesday held
steady from the day before _ 38 killed in central Oklahoma, five in
a community south of Wichita, Kan. _ and rescuers were beginning to
offer the tentative hope that there may actually, unbelievably, be
no more bodies left to find.
</P>
<P>
   And the reason for that seemed to be that here in the southern
Great Plains, where a tornado is not exactly rare, people have
learned since elementary school what they must do when one strikes,
and the lesson has been re-hammered into their heads with each new
storm.
</P>
<P>
   What sets Oklahoma apart, its residents say, is that over
decades, through the schools, public seminars and repeated
television and radio programs, the state has built a population
that understands hostile storms and knows what to do when
confronted with one.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, recent improvements in the technology of
tracking storms and broadcasting the information have made it
possible for these tornado-savvy people to follow a storm as easily
as they follow a football game, down to knowing street-by-street as
the twister approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were watching it on TV and they said, OK, the twister's now
passing Penn Avenue, which is a little ways away from here, so I
could go outside and look up and see it coming,'' said David
Lawrence, whose home, six houses south of the Chases, had suffered
relatively little damage. ``We knew it was time to get inside and
underneath a mattress, just like we've been told to do over and
over again.''
</P>
<P>
   As residents returned to their shattered neighborhoods
Wednesday, the streets filled with pickup trucks loaded with
salvaged goods. Officials said that it was still too early to put a
figure on the extent of the storm damage. One state official said
he expected it to top $1 billion. ``I don't know what the final
total will be, but it will be a big number,'' said Oklahoma City
Mayor Kirk Humphreys.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency officials were able, however, to begin to put a firmer
figure on the number of buildings demolished, at least in the
Oklahoma City metropolitan area, where most of the damage occurred.
The mayor said that 609 homes, 16 businesses, 19 apartments and one
church were totally destroyed by Monday's storm in the metropolitan
area, while another 367 residences and nine businesses suffered at
least ``half-destruction,'' which he said meant the roof was gone
but the walls were still standing. Some lesser damage was suffered
by 878 homes, 24 apartments and six businesses.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time Wednesday, there was a certain level of pride
in the way the city handled this, its latest emergency, numerous
residents and local officials said. Shelters in the hardest hit
areas had filled up with so much food by late afternoon that the
mayor of Moore pleaded with people to bring no more. Relief
drop-sites all over the city were brimming with canned goods and
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Many people credited the city's response to the 1995 terrorist
bombing of the Alfred Murrah Federal Building that left 168 dead
with instilling this self-image among many Oklahoma City residents
that theirs is a town that knows how to handle civic emergencies
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question about it,'' said Gary England, a meteorologist for
KWTV-Channel 9, the city's CBS affiliate, who was credited by
dozens of storm survivors Wednesday with having steered them
through Monday's disaster. ``We take it on the chin but we don't
give in.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   England has been forecasting the weather in Oklahoma for more
than a quarter century and said that when he began, the only way he
would have been able to warn people about a twister was if it
``blew down your friend's house up the road.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, England said, researchers began to develop new Doppler
radar equipment that revolutionized the way weather systems can be
tracked and, in 1981, the first commercial system along those lines
went on line in Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The history has been of good advances in Oklahoma, but this
has come out of necessity,'' England said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, with improved computer models and new
generations of radar, it has become possible to institute the kind
of storm-tracking that was so crucial on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The end result was that on Monday night, for the first time in
my 27 years, I was able to look at that storm, tell people exactly
where it was and where it was going and, when I could see it was at
least an F4 tornado, in terms of intensity, I could say to people
that they were going to have to be below ground level to survive,''
England said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that no matter what I said, somebody was going to
die,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds, perhaps thousands, who knew they could not get
underground, fled the threatened areas, many who had underground
areas went into them while the rest tried their luck under
mattresses and blankets in interior hallways, closets and
bathrooms. The result was hundreds of shattered buildings but less
than four dozen fatalities.
</P>
<P>
   William Brodie tried to ride out the storm with his wife, two
sons, dog, three cats and a pet iguana in an underground shelter
that he'd built in 1972 and was using for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Brodie, a lightning protection consultant for the FAA, said he
believes his family owes their lives to England and other local
meteorologists.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Gary England said `Jiminy Cricket!' and something about
how humongous it was, I just shut everything off and ran for the
shelter,'' Brodie said.
</P>
<P>
   When they came up from the shelter, iguana and all, the house
above them was gone.

NEW YORK GOVERNOR, ATTORNEY GENERAL ANNOUNCE BOXING REFORMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gov. George Pataki and the New York attorney general,
Eliot L. Spitzer, went Wednesday to Madison Square Garden, the
scene of the controversial March 13 heavyweight unification bout
between Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis, to announce a set of
reforms to better screen and select boxing judges and to place
greater controls on promoters and sanctioning organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Their announcement coincided with the news that the proposed
Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act, which aims to reform the business
side of the sport, had been approved Wednesday by the U.S. Senate's
Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, and will come to a
vote of the full Senate perhaps as early as next month.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the reforms that Pataki and Spitzer, who heads the
National Attorneys General Boxing Task Force, unveiled Wednesday
are included in the Ali Act.
</P>
<P>
   The Holyfield-Lewis fight ended in a draw, although many people
who watched the fight believe that Lewis should have won. The
decision prompted a criminal investigation by the Manhattan
district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   The reforms involving judges, which will be implemented and
enforced by the New York State Athletic Commission, call for full
financial disclosure by boxing judges, including consenting to a
credit check, revealing any pending litigation, like bankruptcy
proceedings, and any financial relationships with those involved in
a boxing match, like the promoter, the boxers, the managers and the
broadcast outlets.
</P>
<P>
   It was revealed after the Holyfield-Lewis bout that Eugenia
Williams, the only judge to score the Lewis-Holyfield bout for
Holyfield, had filed for bankruptcy two months before the match.
She was not required to disclose that information to anyone with
the athletic commission.
</P>
<P>
   Prospective judges would also have to pass a written exam before
they received a license to judge fights.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reforms calls for promoters to file their contracts
with boxers with the commission. Each contract must be for no
longer than three years, with an option for only two years.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctioning bodies will have to file copies of their
constitutions and ratings criteria with the commission, and they
cannot exclude any boxer who is not associated with their
organization from their ratings. Also, the sanctioning
organizations have to disclose to the commission the fees they
charge the boxers, and the payments, fees and services received
from promoters.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Pataki and Spitzer have recommended that the
Association of Boxing Commissioners adopt requirements that the
referee keep a scorecard to be submitted in case of a draw; adopt
round-by-round consensus scoring, which throws out the score of a
judge who disagrees with the other two judges, and institute an
independent boxing poll voted on by writers and broadcasters to
better rank boxers.

 &HT;    Agencies looking for ways to ease Kosovars' plight
 &HT;    By Richard Whitt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Although the first refugees from Kosovo aren't due
here until next week, local relief agencies are already feverishly
working to line up housing, furniture and volunteers to help them
resettle.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the early refugees do not have family members in the
United States and have few belongings, relief officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The first group of 400 arrived yesterday at Fort Dix, N.J. About
the same number are to arrive today, according to Peter Herbert,
regional director of the International Rescue Committee.
</P>
<P>
   They are part of 20,000 Kosovo Albanians who will be brought to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll come in with refugee status, which means they can
remain here permanently. However, there is emphasis on letting them
know they can return if they choose. It's up to them,'' Herbert
said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Refugee Act of 1980 established refugee resettlement
programs in all 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia refugee coordinator Barbara Burnham said refugees are
eligible to receive cash and medical assistance and social services
under a federally funded Refugee Resettlement Program. Social
services are provided through local offices of the Department of
Family &AMP; Children Services, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Voluntary agencies contract with the U.S. Department of State to
help refugees through the first 90 days of their resettlement.
</P>
<P>
   In the last five years, more than 15,000 refugees have settled
in Georgia. Most have come from Vietnam (6,473) and Bosnia (3,677),
according to state figures.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, six agencies are helping to find homes for the
Kosovar refugees.
</P>
<P>
   They are: Christian Council of Metropolitan Atlanta, Jewish
Family and Career Services, International Rescue Committee,
Lutheran Ministries of Georgia, Catholic Social Services and World
Relief Refugee Services.
</P>
<P>
   These agencies work with area churches and volunteers to find
homes and support for the new residents.
</P>
<P>
   World Relief spokesman Brian Burt said his agency has already
gotten offers of help from about 20 volunteers and churches.
</P>
<P>
   Pastor Morgan Wallace of Peace Presbyterian Church in
Lawrenceville said his church will sponsor a family, working
through World Relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already started collecting household items and furniture,
beddings, linen _ all things it would take to begin a new life,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The church also provides transportation and other necessities
and has English-language instruction for the refugees, said
Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   Jubilee Partners, a Christian commune in Comer, Ga., will take
25 individuals in cooperation with International Rescue.
</P>
<P>
   The organization, located on a 260-acre farm in Madison County,
operates a refugee orientation center.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the main things we do is give them a peaceful place to
come to while they adjust to different culture. And, to be friends
and help them learn the English language,'' Jubilee staff member
Carolyn Mosley said.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley said many refugees feel a sense of frustration and
loneliness.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sadness of having left their families and
difficulty learning a new language,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It is especially important that these refugees have a period of
quiet before trying to find work and begin their new lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be working with people just weeks out of the
war zone. They'll need weeks to collect themselves before they can
get out on their own,'' Herbert said.

`NORTH CASCADES CREST' CAPTURES THE VISUAL POETRY OF `AMERICA'S
ALPS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fierce and fiercely beautiful terrain of Washington's North
Cascades has inspired poets, but curiously resisted accurate
depiction in photography and literature.
</P>
<P>
   Just getting into the core of the range is so difficult that the
telephoto lens is often used to simulate views available to those
who use their legs. Mount Shuksan is carefully framed in tarns a
few feet from the Mount Baker Highway. Mount Baker is made to grow
out of the roofs of Skagit Valley farmhouses.
</P>
<P>
   In James Martin, however, the mountains have found an author
with music in his soul and a photographer steeped in swirling
clouds and distinctive North Cascades light. He is also a climber
who gets to places where he does not need to play telephoto tricks.
</P>
<P>
   ``North Cascades Crest: Notes and Images from America's Alps,''
is a celebration of the wildest spots in the range, mile-high walls
in the Northern Pickets and the infrequently visited swath of
icefields between the North Cascades Highway and the remote Park
Creek Pass. Non-climbers can enjoy a few of these places, such as
Trapper Peak and Sourdough Mountain, accessible by
</P>
<P>
   steep trails out of the Skagit.
</P>
<P>
   As a young hiker, Martin ran into poet Gary Snyder in the Sierra
Nevadas who told Martin of his summers as a fire lookout atop
Sourdough. He writes movingly of days when poets manned lookouts
high above the Skagit. A funny interval is his account of Allen
Ginsburg running into a fisherman on the trail and telling him:
``We are forest beatniks.''
</P>
<P>
   The most intriguing episode is that of Jack Kerouac, who spent a
summer of solitude atop Desolation Peak east of Ross Lake,
entranced by the black towers of Hozomeen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years of life on the road had ground him down,'' writes
Martin. ``Drugs, booze, false friends, hostile cops, and other
tortures left him exhausted and despairing despite his huge
appetite for life. Desolation Peak cleared his perception. He had
the time to wrestle his demons to a draw, at least temporarily.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid his outstanding photographs, Martin has time to muse. He is
fascinated that peaks bear such names as Terror, Fury, Triumph,
Despair, Inspiration and Forbidden. He traces the path of a young
Seattle teenager named Fred Beckey, who made his initial first
ascent in 1939 (Mount Despair) and a year later took major summits
of the Pickets by storm. It was the kickoff of a 60-year career of
scaling walls from the Bugaboos of British Columbia to the
Himalayas.
</P>
<P>
   Using his camera, Martin shows off the Cascades at sunset, with
sunlight turning clouds into ``a tapestry of reds, yellows and
oranges.'' In words, he details less uplifting Cascade experiences
_ retreating from the Ptarmigan Traverse in a downpour, sweating
through brush of Downey Creek, and trying to find a route across
brushy, rain-slick hillsides.
</P>
<P>
   In a couple of places, he does let the telephoto run wild.
``Dome Peak dominates the skyline from Sahale Peak,'' reads one
caption. It doesn't. Dome is quite some distance from Sahale, and
appears as but one of numerous summits visible in this finest of
all views down the spine of the range.
</P>
<P>
   Other shots legitimately take the breath away, such as the
northeast buttress of Mount Slesse, just over the border in British
Columbia. Slesse is a Salish word meaning ``fang.'' Never was a
mountain better named.
</P>
<P>
   Old-line conservation groups have a curious attitude toward the
North Cascades. When public support was needed for preservation,
the Sierra Club and the Seattle-based Mountaineers group published
picture and guidebooks to encourage attention. After the creation
of parks and wilderness areas, they have seemed intent on limiting
access.
</P>
<P>
   Martin parrots the party line: Not enough land is protected. A
proliferation of backpackers threatens to spoil everything. ``We
foul the water and spook the wildlife,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast! Thanks to hikers, the North Cascades are the most
protected mountains of the ``lower 48'' states. The area Martin is
writing about contains a national park, three national recreation
areas, and four wilderness areas.
</P>
<P>
   Martin ignores the real tale of degradation, though he doubtless
witnessed it when hiking to remote Mount Redoubt via Depot Creek, a
valley that crosses the U.S.-Canadian border near Chilliwack Lake.
</P>
<P>
   The British Columbia Forest Service allowed Depot Creek to be
logged almost to the border. Similar vast clearcuts reach nearly to
timberline, and right up to the boundary, in several areas that are
protected on the U.S. side.
</P>
<P>
   Canadians love to preach at international environmental
conferences. In the North Cascades, however, it is the Yanks who
walked their talk. And, for the most part, so has James Martin in
this splendid celebration of a unique and dramatic corner of
America.

 &HT;    Braves' bats break down Cards 12-3
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Braves spent Wednesday afternoon making Tuesday's
loss to the St. Louis Cardinals a distant memory. An estimated
1,250 feet worth.
</P>
<P>
   That's how far three home runs traveled off the bats of Bret
Boone, Ryan Klesko and Brian Jordan to help run the Cardinals out
of town with a 12-3 pounding by the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   The only bench clearing Wednesday by the Braves came by virtue
of an nine-run lead, as they bullied with their bats, beating Cards
pitchers for 16 hits.
</P>
<P>
   Klesko ended a 15-game homerless drought with a two-run home
run, Boone hit a home run and a double and drove in three runs, and
Brian Jordan came alive from his 1-for-10 slide against his former
team with a two-run home run in the sixth inning. Andruw Jones
chipped in by going 3-for-5 with a double, a triple, two runs
scored and two RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every once in a while we get kicked around, but we stay
positive,'' said Klesko, one of five Braves with two or more RBIs a
day after the Cardinals won 9-1. ``We owed them one back.''
</P>
<P>
   Kent Bottenfield was second in the National League with a 1.53
ERA before the Braves got to him Wednesday for 10 hits, five for
extra bases, and five earned runs. Bottenfield had given up five
runs in his first five starts.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth and fifth runs came with two outs on Klesko's home
run in the third, which put the Braves up for good. It was his
second of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was time to drive in some runs,'' Klesko said.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis had taken a 3-2 lead on a bases-loaded single by Mark
McGwire and an error in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the grand slam he got Tuesday, but he got two runs on
his single and the third on Andruw Jones' error on McGwire's hit.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves had an answer this time, and a quick one. Two home
runs in the next half-inning _ Boone's game-tying and Klesko's
go-ahead _ gave John Smoltz his lead back at 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz didn't budge after that, setting down the next 11 men he
faced. In seven innings, he allowed five hits and three runs, two
earned, and struck out five.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to say, `Enough is enough,' at some point,'' said
Smoltz, who is 5-0 and hitting .375 after going 2-for-2 with a
double and a sacrifice on Wednesday. ``After that, I just beared
down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, who have won 10 of their past 12 and finished the
homestand at 7-2, are 6-0 with Smoltz on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``That might be his worst game of the year,'' manager Bobby Cox
said. ``But if it is, we'll take that for the rest of the year.

HOUSE APPROVES BILL TO RESTRICT DEBT-FORGIVENESS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With Americans filing a record 1.4 million personal
bankruptcies in the last year, the House of Representatives
Wednesday night overwhelmingly approved sweeping legislation
proposed by the nation's largest banks, but opposed by consumer and
civil rights groups, that would make it harder for many people to
erase their debts.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted 313-108 to impose new income requirements on
those in bankruptcy who wish to get a fresh start by making use of
the debt-forgiveness provisions of the law. The bill generally says
that anyone with the ability to make at least $6,000 in payments
over five years would not be able to have their debts forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   It provides an exception, allowing some debt to be forgiven, for
people who make less than the median income in their region.
</P>
<P>
   With similar legislation moving quickly through the Senate, the
White House announced Wednesday that President Clinton's advisers
had recommended that he veto the measure. A similar veto threat
last year helped kill bankruptcy legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The debate on the House floor reflected the recurring question
of whether it is the banks or their customers who are responsible
for the proliferation of bankruptcy filings. As household debt has
risen sharply, the number of personal bankruptcy filings has risen
by 400 percent since 1980, growing by 300,000 in the last year
alone.
</P>
<P>
   But even some conservative Republicans complained that the
legislation was too harsh and would give bankruptcy judges little
authority to offer assistance and protection to those in financial
straits.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking ranks with most of his fellow Republicans, Rep. Henry
Hyde of Illinois, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee,
pleaded to change the legislation so that it would give judges
discretion in deciding the reasonable living expenses for debtors
in bankruptcy. The bill relies on a rigid formula based on expense
allowances of the Internal Revenue Service. The formula takes no
account of a number of significant expenses, like health care and
assistance to elderly parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``For goodness sakes, let us give some flexibility to the
debtor,'' said Hyde, clearly frustrated with his colleagues. ``I'm
as capitalist as anybody and I'm as conservative as anybody. But it
doesn't seem to me that giving some flexibility to someone in
bankruptcy is a renunciation of one's conservative standards.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me also pay my respects to the creditor lobby,'' he added
sarcastically. ``They are awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   But after Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader, rose to
criticize the amendment written by Hyde and the ranking Democrat on
the Judiciary Committee, John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, it was
soundly defeated by a vote of 238 to 184. Armey urged the members
to impose ``legislative discipline'' by giving judges no leeway in
interpreting the bankruptcy law.
</P>
<P>
   The Hyde-Conyers amendment received the support of only 26
Republicans, a clear signal of Hyde's diminishing authority in the
aftermath of his handling of the impeachment of President Clinton.
(Hyde ultimately voted for final passage of the legislation.)
</P>
<P>
   Republicans supporting the legislation said it would impose
sanctions for the failure of consumers to assume personal
responsibility for their actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more we're able to recoup some debt from high-income
people, the less burden we will put on everyone else,'' said Rep.
George Gekas, Pa., who sponsored the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats portrayed the legislation as a sop to the banks and
credit card companies and spoke of Dickensian hardships it would
create, particularly for single parents and children. Under the
legislation, credit card companies would be able to receive
repayment of debt at the same rate as debts like child support.
</P>
<P>
   They also said the record number of personal bankruptcies was as
much a result of the easy extension of credit. Last year, for
instance, credit card companies sent out some four billion
unsolicited letters offering consumers new credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``A more balanced bill would require responsible behavior not
only of debtors, but of credit card companies as well that have
done so much to drive consumers into bankruptcy,'' said Rep. Bill
Delahunt, D-Mass. ``This bill, in effect, would turn a taxpayer
funded system, the bankruptcy court, into a new collection
instrument for credit card companies.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation gives many benefits to the credit card
companies. It permits them to challenge bankruptcy filings. It
restricts class-action lawsuits that in the past have been brought
accusing banks of harsh repayment agreements. And it gives the
companies an equal priority with claimants of child support.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing its opposition to the legislation, the
administration said it unfairly tilted against consumers,
particularly the less affluent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the bill's provisions are unfair to middle- and
low-income debtors,'' the administration said in a statement issued
about the legislation. ``At the same time, the bill fails to close
loopholes in current law that protect the wealthiest debtors.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, both the House and Senate adopted competing
legislation overhauling the bankruptcy system. After those bills
were reconciled in conference, the Senate failed to adopt the
legislation in the face of a presidential veto and it died in the
final days of the congressional session.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved a similar
measure by a vote of 14-4. Senate leaders have said they expect to
introduce it on the floor as early as this month.

U.S. ISSUING ARREST WARRANT FOR ABORTION FOE LINKED TO DOCTOR'S
MURDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal law enforcement officials said Wednesday that they had
concluded that James Kopp, an impassioned and nomadic opponent of
abortion, fired the shots that killed a Buffalo, N.Y.,
abortion-clinic doctor last October.
</P>
<P>
   Based on physical evidence _ including a rifle found in April
month buried near the doctor's house and a match between fibers
found near the murder and others found in Kopp's car _ officials
said they had decided to issue a warrant for his arrest in the
killing of Dr. Barnett Slepian.
</P>
<P>
   Kopp, a fugitive, has until now been described only as a
material witness and a nationwide warrant had been issued so that
he could be held for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   There was no official confirmation of the decision to upgrade
the warrant, but Denise O'Donnell, the U.S. attorney for the
Western District of New York in Buffalo, has scheduled a news
conference Thursday to announce a ``major development'' in the
Slepian murder investigation. Erie County District Attorney Frank
Clark, Bernard Tolbert, the special FBI agent in charge of the
Buffalo office, and other investigators will also be there.
</P>
<P>
   Since there is no federal homicide statute as such, the federal
officials said Kopp could be charged under the recent Freedom of
Access to Clinic Entrances Act, which provides for a sentence of up
to life imprisonment for someone convicted of physical assaults or
threats against abortion providers. If Kopp were also indicted and
convicted on state murder charges, he could face the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Slepian, a 52-year-old obstetrician and gynecologist who was the
mainstay of Buffalo's only abortion clinic, was shot to death on
the night of Oct. 23 as he stood in the kitchen of his home in
suburban Amherst, N.Y. chatting with his wife and one of his four
sons.
</P>
<P>
   No weapon was recovered in the first police searches of the area
around Slepian's home. But on April 8, investigators, wondering how
the assailant could have emerged from the woods without fearing he
would be seen carrying a rifle, searched the site of the shooting
once more and unearthed a rifle buried one foot below ground 200
feet behind the Slepian home.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, the Erie district attorney, said afterwards that
investigators think the doctor's killer buried the rifle in the
days before the shooting, unearthed the weapon to fire the fatal
shots, then hurriedly reburied it and fled.
</P>
<P>
   The 44-year-old Kopp, who in FBI photographs appears as gaunt
and scruffily bearded and whose last known addresses were in
Vermont and New Jersey, emerged as the focus of the investigation
within two weeks of the slaying. A jogger observed Kopp's car at 6
a.m. near Slepian's home 10 days before the murder, and, curious
why a stranger would be parked there so early, wrote down the
license plate number.

FIREFIGHTERS AND POLICE OFFICERS LOST HOMES, BUT KEPT ANSWERING
TORNADO CALLS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With OKLA-STORM, OKLA-SEARCH) 
(nk) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY _ Assistant Fire Chief John Hansen was on his
first call after the tornadoes hit on Monday night, helping
hundreds of dazed and injured students out of their ruined high
school, when his eyes turned homeward.
</P>
<P>
   His two-story townhouse was on the other side of a small creek
to the east of the school, Westmoore High.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked over and the trees were gone,'' Hansen recalled
Wednesday. ``The area was pretty well devastated. I knew then it
was a good possibility that my house was going to be one of those
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he stayed on the job.
</P>
<P>
   He learned later that his family, and his father who lived
around the corner, had safely evacuated their homes, but that the
tornado had blown away a wall of his townhouse, burst all the
windows, flooded the rooms and broke much of the furniture.
</P>
<P>
   He was among dozens of rescue workers here who lost their homes
but continued working to help others even though they could use a
little rescuing themselves. By his own count, 19 members of the
Oklahoma City Fire Department and 23 members of the Oklahoma City
Police Department returned from work to find their houses
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   In Moore, a suburb just southwest of here, the rescue workers
fared little better. Police Sgt. Jeff Owens lived in the Highland
Park neighborhood, where whole blocks were razed. His house was
among them, and his patrol car was smashed to pieces. After working
with search and rescue teams for two days, he finally returned home
Wednesday to begin picking up the pieces of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a trooper,'' said Glenn Lewis, the mayor of Moore. ``He
was out here working to help others, in his sneakers, because his
shoes blew away.''
</P>
<P>
   The deputy fire chief of Moore, Jerry Dosher, lost his house as
well. His wife had to be dug out of the rubble. ``But he went right
back to work,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the rescue workers who lost their homes, Hansen among
them, ignited a brief controversy here when they were allowed back
to check their homes in neighborhoods where the authorities had
barred other homeowners from entering. The flap, which lived mainly
on talk radio, ended when the authorities began to let civilians
back into the neighborhoods in question.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen, who became a nationally recognizable figure four years
ago when he served as a department spokesman and a calming voice
after the federal building here was bombed, has spent most of the
last few days helping others. While he worried about his house, his
family, and his father, he said, he just kept taking calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The firefighter in you and the parent or spouse are closely
connected,'' he said. ``The firefighter in you says, there are
people right here who need my help. And there are my colleagues,
who will go help my loved ones just as I'm helping someone else's
loved ones. That's the discipline you have. `'

<P>
   Having cleared the way to become the nation's biggest cable
television company by acquiring Mediaone Group Inc., AT&AMP;T Corp. on
Wednesday moved closer to a partnership with Microsoft Corp., the
software giant. The whirlwind of deals surrounding AT&AMP;T raised
concerns in Washington and in many high-technology quarters about
the prospects for competition in the fast-growing communications
industry.
</P>
<P>
   With its cable and Microsoft deals, AT&AMP;T, which two years ago
appeared as a crippled giant, is poised to once again stand astride
the communications world. For Microsoft, a strong relationship with
AT&AMP;T could become the company's most important vehicle for
expanding from the arena of desktop computers and into a new world
in which millions of consumers use seamless bundles of telephone,
television and high-speed Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   But for regulators and competitors in industries ranging from
computers to telephones to Internet access, a partnership between
AT&AMP;T and Microsoft, which is still being negotiated, could appear
as frightening as it is formidable. AT&AMP;T's expansion into cable
television so quickly and broadly _ starting with its deal last
year to acquire Tele-Communications Inc., then the No. 2 cable
company _ raised concerns on its own.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, AT&AMP;T opened a path to acquire Mediaone, the No. 4
cable company, for $58 billion. To set up that deal, AT&AMP;T agreed to
sell up to 2 million of its existing cable subscribers to Comcast
Corp., which had made an earlier agreement to acquire Mediaone. In
exchange, Comcast agreed to withdraw its Mediaone bid and to offer
local telephone service over its cable lines in league with AT&AMP;T,
the nation's biggest telephone company.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft had earlier considered backing Comcast in a fight
against AT&AMP;T, but decided instead to try to form a partnership with
AT&AMP;T to use Microsoft's Windows operating system as part of AT&AMP;T's
cable-based communications system.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate antitrust subcommittee said Wednesday that it would
hold hearings into the competitive impact of AT&AMP;T's looming
acquisition of Mediaone. AT&AMP;T wants to use cable systems to offer
integrated bundles of telephone, television and high-speed Internet
service to millions of consumers. The subcommittee's leadership
said that AT&AMP;T's expansion into the cable business could speed the
advent of local telephone competition, but added that AT&AMP;T's
dealmaking might slow competition in video services.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal will likely increase AT&AMP;T's ability to provide
competitive local phone service to residential customers, which we
certainly support,'' Sen. Michael DeWine, R-Ohio, the
subcommittee's chairman, and Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., the ranking
minority member, said in a statement. ``But the jury is still out
on how it will affect the cable/video market and we need to closely
examine all of the competitive aspects of the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts decried AT&AMP;T's flurry of deals as good for all of
the companies involved, and the market supported that notion.
AT&AMP;T's shares rose, $5.375 on Wednesday, to $56.9375, while
Comcast's shares gained $9.1875, to $73.3125. Microsoft's shares
rose $1.0625, to $79.125. Mediaone's shares fell by 75 cents, to
$76.875, perhaps on disappointment that an extended bidding war for
the company appears highly unlikely. What clearly emerges from the
whirlwind of billion-dollar dealing is a sense that AT&AMP;T is putting
the pieces together to achieve a level of importance in the
communications landscape unmatched by any company since the old
American Telephone and Telegraph broke up under government pressure
in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the resurgent AT&AMP;T could become a major force in
promoting competition. That is because AT&AMP;T, with its cable lines
into millions of homes, has now become the biggest threat to the
Baby Bells' functional monopoly in offering local phone service to
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   None of the other long-distance giants has announced a
full-fledged plan to offer local phone service to residential
consumers, but AT&AMP;T has made offering local service in competition
with the Bells a cornerstone of its strategy.
</P>
<P>
   But because AT&AMP;T is moving so fast to gain links to U.S. homes,
and because of its legacy as the nation's telephone monopoly, any
strategic relationship it forges with Microsoft is bound to raise
eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   ``AT&AMP;T is putting together a cable monopoly that is beyond the
wildest dreams of John Malone,'' said Gregory C. Simon, co-director
of Open Net Coalition, a group that includes many of AT&AMP;T's
competitors _ including America Online and Mindspring in Internet
service and MCI Worldcom in long distance _ and a former domestic
policy adviser to Vice President Al Gore. ``And now that they have
cornered the network, they are putting the network under lock and
key by putting Microsoft technology inside the set-top box.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft dominates the market for personal computer software.
But its main objective in dealing with AT&AMP;T was to obtain assured
access for its software and Internet commerce businesses _ and
preferred access, if possible _ to the fast-growing high-speed data
network that AT&AMP;T is assembling.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal being negotiated between AT&AMP;T and
Microsoft, Microsoft will invest about $5 billion in AT&AMP;T, perhaps
in exchange for some sort of preferred stock in AT&AMP;T. AT&AMP;T would
also agree to use Microsoft's software in its integrated packages
of voice, video and data service.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T is adamant that Microsoft will not get an exclusive
arrangement to supply its Windows CE software on the set-top boxes
of AT&AMP;T's expanded network. But Microsoft is negotiating hard to
get AT&AMP;T to agree to allow its Windows CE software to be rolled out
in at least one large cable market run by AT&AMP;T, as an early proving
ground for Microsoft's set-top box technology, according to people
close to the talks.
</P>
<P>
   For Microsoft, a $5 billion investment is a fairly conservative
hedge against the uncertain future represented by so-called
broadband networks, in which households are continuously connected
to high-speed data lines.
</P>
<P>
   These broadband networks _ whether built by cable companies,
regional phone companies or wireless operators _ are expected to
stream video, audio and text into people's homes, everything from
movies-on-demand to e-mail. And users will tap into this rich flow
of information and entertainment using various equipment, from
Internet-enabled televisions to handheld devices. It is seen as a
world of diverse information appliances, and all of them will need
software.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft wants to compete in that market against traditional
makers of cable television equipment, including General Instrument
Corp. and Scientific-Atlanta Inc. Before being acquired by AT&AMP;T,
TCI had agreed to use Java software from Sun Microsystems Inc. in
its advanced set-top boxes. Executives close to the negotiations
said that agreement would not be affected by AT&AMP;T's looming deal
with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   To bring the United States to this broadband future, the cable
industry, including AT&AMP;T, is locked in a battle against the Baby
Bells, GTE and the rest of the local phone industry. As that
inter-industry fight intensifies, and as AT&AMP;T becomes a unifying
force in the cable business, some of the rivalries that had
traditionally divided cable operators may soon disappear.
</P>
<P>
   In acquiring Mediaone, AT&AMP;T will also get a 25 percent stake in
some of Time Warner's cable systems, its HBO cable network and its
Warner Brothers movie studio.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Time Warner, which has bickered incessantly with Mediaone on a
number of issues, sat on the sidelines as Comcast and AT&AMP;T jockeyed
for Mediaone, rooting simply for one of the deals to occur. Even
though AT&AMP;T's victory creates a bigger rival for its cable systems,
Time Warner benefits by eliminating Mediaone's influence over its
cable and movie units.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pleased with the outcome and pleased with the role Brian
Roberts played in bringing the companies together with a solution
that benefits the cable industry,'' Gerald Levin, Time Warner's
chairman, said in a prepared statement, referring to Comcast's
president.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner is likely to try to create accords with AT&AMP;T on a
number of fronts, according to media executives. It hopes to find a
way to buy control back of HBO and Warner Brothers. In return, it
will likely look for ways for Road Runner, the high-speed Internet
service in which it is a shareholder, to cooperate with At Home, a
comparable service in which AT&AMP;T is the leading shareholder. The
services could be merged out right, or they could be linked more
closely using compatible technology. As part of this, Time Warner
is likely to complete its planed venture to offer local telephone
service through its cable systems in cooperation with AT&AMP;T. The
deal, announced in February, was being delayed by Mediaone,
executives said.
</P>
<P>
   But just as the cable industry rallies around AT&AMP;T and At Home,
the biggest player in the Internet market today _ America Online _
is notably excluded from the party.
</P>
<P>
   For now, America Online plans to offer high speed services using
a technology that uses telephone lines rather than cable wires. It
already has agreements with Bell Atlantic and SBC communications
and is courting the other local phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   America Online is also eager to have access to cable systems as
well and considered backing Comcast in an effort to outbid AT&AMP;T for
Mediaone, but ultimately decided the deal was an expensive way to
get into a business that is growing much slower than its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, we are a pure Internet Company, said
Robert Pittman, America Online's president. ``We used to be in the
data transport business and we got out of it,'' he said.

APACHE HELICOPTER MAY HAVE HIT POWER LINE OR TREE, OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIRANA, Albania _ The Apache helicopter crash that killed two
American pilots early on today in rugged mountains about 45 miles
from here may have been caused by a rotor clipping a power line or
a tree, military officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The crash killed Chief Warrant Officer, Third Class, David A.
Gibbs, 38, of Ohio and Chief Warrant Officer, Second Class, Kevin
L. Reichert, 28, of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter, heavy with fuel and weapons, crashed while
carrying out a mock attack and exploded on impact just after 1:30
a.m. on Wednesday, according to the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Garrie Dornan, an army spokesman here, said the
helicopter was flying under ``total blackout conditions.'' The
Apaches fly at night with no lights on to avoid being shot down by
shoulder-fired missiles or low-altitude anti-aircraft guns.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter exploded on impact, he said, sending a fireball
into the night sky that was spotted by fellow Apache pilots flying
nearby. Both crew members appeared to have been killed instantly,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter was carrying live weapons, even though it was not
on a combat mission, because of threats from terrorists or even
Yugoslav forces across the border in Kosovo, an Army official said.
</P>
<P>
   The crash was the second in nine days. Last week, another Apache
helicopter went down during a nighttime training mission, but its
crew escaped with only cuts and bruises.A team of investigators
from Fort Rucker, Ala., sent to investigate the first Apache crash,
will stay to investigate the second.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots killed in the crash were members of C Troop, 6th
Squadron, 6th Cavalry Regiment, part of the Army's 11th Aviation
Regiment, based in Illesheim, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO officials summoned the attack helicopters as an
answer to the failure of heavy high-altitude bombing to stop the
Serbian push against ethnic Albanians, it has been a mission
plagued by logistical problems and lengthy delays.
</P>
<P>
   American aviators piloting the Apaches face a nightmarish array
of natural and man-made obstacles as they fly at night, at high
speed and low altitude through northern Albania into Kosovo,
according to military and civilian helicopter pilots here. The
two-person crews, they said, are trying to navigate a maze of
ravines of ridges with poorly marked maps that do not clearly list
all of the manmade obstacles, such as power lines, a helicopter can
strike.
</P>
<P>
   The Apaches could still prove to be a powerful weapon, but for
now critics are citing them as an example of a lack of planning by
the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Dornan vowed that the training mission accidents would not delay
the long-awaited launch of combat missions. He and NATO officials
cautioned that the flights were inherently dangerous and that more
casualties are likely.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Walter Jertz, a NATO spokesman, said on Wednesday in
Brussels, This is not Desert Storm,'' referring to the desert
terrain of the Gulf War. ``We are talking about a different
terrain. We are talking about a different situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Apache, a helicopter originally designed to attack thousands
of Warsaw Pact tanks advancing across the plains of Northern
Europe, performed brilliantly in the Gulf war, wiping out hundreds
of Iraqi tanks and vehicles, according to Pentagon officials. But
the effort to deploy them in mountainous Balkan terrain against
dug-in opponents may show their shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks and two crashes after the Apaches arrived, they have
yet to fly a combat mission.
</P>
<P>
   The delay, other helicopter pilots said, may be a blessing for
Apache crews. Knowledge of the jagged terrain in northern Albania,
particularly for pilots flying at night, is crucial. The area is an
aeronautical minefield, they said, where 3,000-foot mountains
abruptly rise from valley floors and power lines haphazardly dot
the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Carrier, a Canadian pilot who has been flying in Albania
for four years, said that like much else in Albania, Europe's
poorest country, power lines were built in a haphazard fashion and
are poorly marked. While in other countries power line towers are
usually same height and placed roughly 1,000 feet apart, in
northern Albania the towers vary in height and can be as far as
1,500 to 2,000 yards apart.
</P>
<P>
   A European military pilot who spoke on the condition of
anonymity said that NATO maps show the power lines, but not in
great detail. He said the towers do not have orange markers placed
on top of power line towers in Western Europe and many of them are
rusted.
</P>
<P>
   The Apache is equipped with a ``pilot night sensor'' which
allows it to ``navigate and attack'' at night, according to
military officials. But how well the Apaches, which must fly low to
avoid enemy radar, can maneuver at night is clearly being tested in
the mountains here.
</P>
<P>
   Dornan called the mood among the U.S. soldiers here ``mournful
but resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a hazardous and risky business, flying at night with
heavy loads and full ordinance,'' he said. ``We're flying in
difficult terrain. We're flying under difficult conditions.''

STOCKS MAKE IMPRESSIVE COMEBACK AFTER SLUMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks rebounded from early losses Wednesday to
finish solidly ahead, as investors showed renewed affection for the
blue-chip growth stocks they had shunned lately.
</P>
<P>
   While none of the major indexes reached new peaks, all reversed
course about 1 p.m. and climbed steadily to finish at their best
levels. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 69.30 points to
regain more than half the ground it lost Tuesday, after closing
above 11,000 for the first time Monday. It ended 0.64 percent
higher, at 10,955.41.
</P>
<P>
   The NASDAQ composite index did even better, surging 1.98
percent, or 49.32 points, to 2,534.44.
</P>
<P>
   ``The familiar growth names came back,'' said Timothy O'Grady, a
portfolio manager at First Capital Group. ``Some of these stocks
were in a deeply oversold condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Although interest rates were a bit lower throughout the session,
stocks did not spring back until midday. Some analysts attributed
the recovery to comments by General Electric chairman John Welch,
who told a Florida conference that his company, which has a market
capitalization second only to Microsoft, would ``at least'' match
Wall Street's expectations of a 14 percent earnings gain this year.
</P>
<P>
   Others mentioned circulation of a Federal Reserve survey showing
the economy growing at a moderate pace with prices generally still
``stable.'' With the quarterly season for corporate earnings
reports largely over, much of the attention, analysts said, has
returned to the economy. On Friday, the Labor Department is to
report on the April job market.
</P>
<P>
   The market will also pay close attention Thursday to a speech on
the economy by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, winner of the bidding contest for Mediaone, was a standout
performer, jumping 5], to 56 15/16, on turnover of nearly 32
million shares. The other leading gains among the Dow Jones blue
chips were 5 points, to 139, for J.P. Morgan; 4 1/16, to 109, for
General Electric; 2\, to 129], for American Express, and 1 15/16,
to 72 13/16, for Merck.
</P>
<P>
   Among the prominent losers were stocks sensitive to the economy
that had become suddenly popular last month after long trailing the
growth standbys. Alcoa, for example, slipped ~, to 60 3/16, after
trading as high as 65| last Thursday, United Technologies 1~, to
145}, and Minnesota Mining 1 9/16, to 92]. General Motors fell 2
1/16, to 86 15/16, after reporting lower sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the move to cyclicals has been overdone,'' said Joseph
Battipaglia, investment policy chairman at Gruntal.
</P>
<P>
   Internet and other high-technology stocks joined the afternoon
revival, with America Online a pivotal issue as it posted a
2|-point gain, to 129}, after trading as low as 115{.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of comeback ``tends to set the tone'' for the market
in general, said Philip Schettewi, a managing partner at Loomis
Sayles. ``A lot of people get conditioned to buy the dips, which
keep getting shallower,'' he added. Ebay ended 5 9/16 higher at 186
13/16 after trading as low as 168, Amazon.com rose 3{, to 146{,
after having been down to 133~, and Microsoft advanced 1 1/16, to
79[, after trading at 76 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   Among financial stocks, Chase Manhattan fell 2 1/16, to 80 3/16,
in contrast to Morgan's big gain that seemed related to news of
plans to enhance its Internet trading capability. Goldman Sachs,
trading for the second day, eased 1\, to 69[; it went public at 53
on Tuesday. Charles Schwab jumped 5}, to 107{.
</P>
<P>
   Volume on the New York Stock Exchange edged down to a
still-hefty 913.6 million shares, with gaining stocks holding only
a slim margin over declining ones, 1,565 to 1,444. But 66 issues
made new 52-week highs and only 17 new lows
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 15.31 points, or
1.15 percent, to 1,347.31.
</P>
<P>
   Except for Brazil, where the Bovespa climbed 2.75 percent,
foreign markets were nearly all lower by about 1.5 percent or more.

U.N. COMMISSIONER DENOUNCES SERB EFFORT TO EXPEL REFUGEES 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said
Wednesday that Kosovo was being ``brutally and methodically''
emptied by an ``ethnic cleansing'' campaign and that the 700,000
refugees from Kosovo would return home only if Serbian forces
withdrew and an ``armed international force'' assured their safety.
</P>
<P>
   In her first formal statement on the crisis to the 15-member
Security Council since NATO air strikes began, and in an interview
later Wednesday, the commissioner, Sadako Okata, attributed the
refugee crisis not to NATO's air strikes, but to what she called
``the systematic and intolerable violence'' being waged by Serb
forces against the Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of NATO bombing may have been a factor in the flight of
20,000 Muslims from part of Yugoslavia into Bosnia, she said. But
most of the Kosovo Albanians interviewed by her agency in camps in
Albania, Macedonia, and Montenegro said they had either been
expelled from their homes or terrorized into fleeing.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Mrs. Ogata refused to call the campaign
``genocide.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Ogata's agency provided specific estimates of the growth of
the refugee population since NATO began its air strikes. Before
March 23, when her agency ``reluctantly'' left Kosovo, she said,
the agency was helping 400,000 displaced people inside Kosovo and
Montenegro, and 89,500 refugees outside of Kosovo. As of Wednesday,
Mrs. Okata said, the number of refugees outside Kosovo stood at
700,000 _ including 404,000 in Albania, 211,000 Montenegro, and
62,000 displaced people in Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees' plight, she continued, is ``increasingly
desperate.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has proposed a
``humanitarian'' mission to Kosovo to begin exploring, among other
things, whether rape is being used systematically by the Serbs as a
weapon of war. But Belgrade still has not responded to Annan's
request, diplomats said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After having publicly objected to such a mission on Tuesday, a
spokesman for Sergey Lavrov, the Russian representative to the
United Nations, said that Moscow did not oppose the mission,
provided it assessed not only the refugee crisis but also the
damage to Yugoslavia's infrastructure caused by the NATO bombing.

 &HT;    `Flash' remembers life with less cash
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Through three wins as a rookie on the Senior PGA Tour,
Bruce Fleisher's bank account has reached a different level. The
same for his answering machine, which after a victory in the
season-opening event at Key Biscayne, Fla., was stuffed with 463
messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you have to remember,'' said Fleisher, a Palm Beach
Gardens, Fla., resident, ``these are the people you've touched for
30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher's perspective remains unchanged. No matter how many
Ritz-Carltons might enter Fleisher's life, when a $2 million season
actually is possible, he will not forget the Red Roof Inns and
Monday qualifiers of the PGA Tour. After Fleisher won his first two
events on the Senior Tour in February, establishing a record that
not even Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer or Lee Trevino could match,
Fleisher fought off any evidence of ego inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a hell of a note,'' he said then, ``me replacing some
of the greatest golfers in the world. They can make that my
epitaph.''
</P>
<P>
   When they paired Fleisher, 50, at the PGA Seniors Championship
with Palmer and Trevino, the man they call ``Flash'' said, ``Who
cares if Bruce Fleisher wins? These guys are legends. I'm not a
legend.''
</P>
<P>
   He is, however, quite a story. As the Nationwide Championship
unfolds Friday at the Golf Club of Georgia, Fleisher, who arrived
through qualifying school, already has to modify his rookie goals.
One was to make the top 31 and retain fully exempt status for 2000.
The other was to move up on the career money list, and with
$842,220, he's already up to 69th.
</P>
<P>
   There's not much more Fleisher could be doing. Had he not gotten
sick after the record start, he might have won five times by now.
David Duval has nothing on Fleisher's statistical domination.
Playing just eight events, he leads in scoring average (69.29),
putting (1.744 per green), birdies (4.04 per round), sand saves
percentage (70.4) and all-around ranking, 50 points ahead of
second-place Vicente Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bruce and I were talking (at Charlotte) about playing the last
two rounds together at tour school,'' Allen Doyle said. ``It
wouldn't have surprised me that the two of us would be playing in
the last group of this event, but walking off the first tee winning
close to half the events that have been played and being 1-2 on the
money list, that's a little more than we might have expected to
accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher's trademark now is a pair of wrap-around sunglasses.
When he won the U.S. Amateur as a 19-year-old, he wore tattersall
pants with frayed cuffs. His nickname then was ``Teen Angel.'' He
made 280 cuts on the PGA Tour, but only won once, at the 1991 New
England Classic at age 42, and accurately describes himself as ``a
journeyman, a grinder.'' Even today with the rest of the Senior
Tour chasing him, Fleisher admits to his faults, even if they
haven't been noticeable lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to screw up,'' he said. ``I'm going to choke and
gag.''
</P>
<P>
   He marvels at what television exposure has done to his
recognition factor. Last week at the Bruno's Memorial Classic in
Birmingham, Ala., he was eating breakfast in a country eatery when
a lady said, ``Oh, yeah, I saw you on television. You're the one
who wears stockings.''
</P>
<P>
   The reference was to last month's snow-stormed Tradition in
Scottsdale, Ariz., where Fleisher borrowed a page from Joe Namath's
old playbook and wore a pair of panty hose from his wife, Wendy, to
keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   Life's contrasts? In 1980, Wendy almost died while giving birth
to their only child, Jessica. Wanting to stay closer to her after
the crisis, Bruce became a club pro in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   After returning to the PGA Tour in his 40s, Fleisher had to
grind his way through tour school to keep his card. When he earned
a Senior Tour card last December, Fleisher felt like he had won a
major.
</P>
<P>
   ``You either make that school or go find yourself a job,'' he
said. ``At 50 years old, you don't want to be playing Nike Tour
events. There was a lot of pressure there that I wouldn't wish on
my worst enemy.''

 &HT;    Scottish refs stand their ground
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This is not a good time to be a Scottish referee _ on
either side of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   The referee who was hit in the head with a pound coin and later
had bricks thrown through his windows after Rangers clinched the
Scottish Premier League title is unfazed about calling the May 29
rematch with Celtic in the Scottish Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Dallas ejected three players and soon after being struck
with the projectile awarded a penalty kick to Rangers. That
prompted four Celtic hooligans to rush onto the Celtic Park pitch
and assault him. A steward also was injured and 113 people were
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is going to ruin my day that day,'' Dallas told the
British Press Association, in reference to the Scottish Cup final
assignment. ``You can't be hounded out because of a mindless thug
who wants to have a pop at you.''
</P>
<P>
   Major League Soccer officials are defending a Scottish referee
participating in a league exchange program who whipped out cards at
a record pace. Stuard Dougal handed out an MLS record 11 yellow and
three red cards in Sunday's 3-2 victory by Chicago against D.C.
United. He broke his mark on cautions from the week before, when he
booked 10 players in San Jose's shootout victory against Los
Angeles. In his three MLS matches, Dougal issued 26 yellows and
three reds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we need to go 4,000 miles to get a referee that
poor,'' said D.C. United president and general manager Kevin Payne,
enraged when United's Brian Kamler was issued a red card for a
minor elbowing incident. Two of his teammates also got tossed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the fine I get will pay for (Dougal's) ticket home,''
Payne said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   MLS officials denied that international referees were thumbing
their noses at the quality of play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not the Bundesliga; we are not Serie A,'' said U.S.
Soccer Federation referee supervisor Esse Baharmast. ``But the
people coming here do have respect for the level of play.''
</P>
<P>
   In Glasgow, a TV-dictated 6 p.m. Sunday start gave fans of the
normally acrimonious Rangers and Celtic all day to imbibe. But most
of the arrests came during post-match rowdiness in a part of town
known for its pub crawls. SFA officials plan to tighten security
before the Scottish Cup grudge match.
</P>
<P>
   Payne, by the way, was fined $15,000, the second-highest fine in
MLS history. That kind of cash should just about get Dougal on the
Concorde, and none too soon, as far as Payne is concerned.
</P>
<P>
   UEFA finalists stumble in
</P>
<P>
   Olympique Marseille appears to have risen from the humiliation
of a match-fixing scandal disclosed the day after winning the 1993
European Cup. Parma is aiming for only its second European trophy.
But neither team is in the best of moods heading into Wednesday's
UEFA Cup finals in Moscow (2:30 p.m., Fox Sports World Espanol).
</P>
<P>
   Marseille gave up two goals in the final seven minutes to Paris
Saint-Germain in a 2-1 loss Tuesday that puts it a point behind
Girondins Bordeaux in the French first-division title race. And
despite a recent $60 million spending spree, Parma is left to vie
for only the continent's second-best club championship and probably
will miss the Champions' League next year.
</P>
<P>
   Marseille, 0-2-2 in its past four French league outings, will be
without strikers Fabrizio Ravanelli and Christophe Dugarry. Both
are suspended because of a raucous post-match brawl after its
semifinal victory against Bologna.
</P>
<P>
   Parma should be in better spirits after beating Fiorentina in
the Coppa Italia finals on Wednesday. The teams tied 3-3 on
aggregate, but Paolo Vanoli's header in the 71st minute gave Parma
the edge on away goals.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina: 'Hot Chocolate' served
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's ``El Superclasico'' duel pitting Buenos Aires rivals
Boca Juniors and River Plate (4 p.m., Fox Sports World Espanol) has
major Clausura season implications on the line. Host Boca, which
plays at the formidable home ground called La Bombonera (``The
Chocolate Box''), leads by 26 points, while River is tied with San
Lorenzo for second with 21 apiece. River must find a way to shut
down Boca striker Martin Palermo, who has nine goals in his last 11
matches. England: Arsenal widens lead
</P>
<P>
   If Arsenal does win its second Premier League title in a row, it
might have Liverpool to thank. As the Gunners were putting the
finishing touches on a 3-1 victory against Tottenham Hotspur on
Wednesday, Liverpool's Paul Ince scored a dramatic 88th minute
equalizer against his old club for a 2-2 draw with Manchester
United. And Chelsea's 1-0 victory against Leeds has the top three
spots still up for grabs. Arsenal has 75 points to 72 for United,
while Chelsea is at 71.

 Justice Resurrects Antitrust Probe of Network Solutions
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Jon Swartz &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Federal antitrust officials have reopened a 1997 probe of Network
Solutions Inc., the U.S. government-sanctioned company in charge of
registering the most popular Web addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said the Justice Department objects to NSI's insistence
on controlling a database of more than 4 million registrations it
has compiled since 1993, when it won the exclusive contract to
assign top-level domain names from the National Science Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Privately, NSI officials are perplexed by the action. They
question why the Justice Department is reviving a nearly 2-year-old
probe at a time when other companies now are authorized to register
addresses with top-level Web suffixes such as .com and .org.
</P>
<P>
   But evidently, the Justice Department thinks that NSI is
clinging to control by not sharing key information in the database
with its new competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are reviewing whether NSI's claim of exclusive
rights to the database violates antitrust law, according to those
familiar with the probe.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's antitrust division is ``looking at the
possibility of anticompetitive practices in the Internet address
registration industry,'' a department spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've revived communications with the Department of Justice
and their request for additional information about NSI's business
practices,'' NSI spokesman Christopher Clough said. He added that
NSI is cooperating with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Justice Department suspended its investigation of
possible anticompetitive practices by the Herndon, Va., company
after the Clinton administration formed an international nonprofit,
Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, to end NSI's
monopoly on the most popular online addresses.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's move is designed to give consumers the
benefits of a competitive market for online addresses.
</P>
<P>
   The popular domain names are considered prime real estate
destinations for selling goods and conducting business on the
Internet, and they are a major reason behind NSI's market valuation
of $2.25 billion. NSI has registered three-fourths of the world's
5.5 million online addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, America Online, France Telecom and three other
high-tech companies were the first selected to compete against NSI
under a two-month test program. A second group of 29 companies led
by AT&AMP;T Corp. is expected to follow them and dole out popular Web
addresses as early as this summer.
</P>
<P>
   But negotiations between NSI and the government apparently hit a
snag over how NSI will share information from its database with new
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   NSI will continue to maintain a master database of addresses.
The company will receive at least $9 for each domain name its
competitors register and will charge test registrars a one-time
licensing fee of $10,000 for software. Test registrars also will
pay a $5,000 annual accreditation fee to ICANN for administrative
costs.
</P>
<P>
   NSI charges consumers $70 for registering a Web address for the
first two years, and $35 for each additional 12 months.

   MEXICO CITY _ A yellow school bus loaded with wheelchairs,
aspirin and pencils for rebel Indian villages in the southern state

the project, drove two similar shipments to Chiapas in the last 18
months, gliding past Mexican customs officials after routine
inspections in a day or two each time. So he was taken aback when
customs officials in Reynosa, Mexico, told him this time that he
needed a sheaf of permits from at least three federal agencies,
which could take as long as a month to secure.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials insisted that Young simply failed to obtain
papers that are required of all groups making charitable donations
in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no political considerations, and the destination of
the shipment had nothing to do with it,'' said Jose Antonio
Zabalgoitia, the spokesman for the Mexican Embassy in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But Young said he believes that his troubles began when he made
it clear that the aid was intended for Indian communities in the
Chiapas highlands that are strongholds of the Zapatista rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The government's first move, both Young and Mexican customs
officials said, was to try to persuade him to channel the donation
through the governor of Chiapas. The Zapatistas are bitter enemies
of the governor, Roberto Albores Guillen.
</P>
<P>
   Young agreed to turn the goods over to Caritas, the aid group of
the Roman Catholic Church. Mexican officials refused to accept the
church agency as a sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   The government and the Zapatistas have accused each other of
using aid for political purposes. Zapatista communities refuse to
accept assistance from government agencies, saying that officials
use it to sway their loyalties. As a result, the communities are
sorely in need of private help for food and medicines.
</P>
<P>
   The government has stepped up all its social programs in
Chiapas, hoping to pull support among the Indians away from the
rebel movement. It has expelled a number of foreign aid workers
based in Chiapas, accusing them of meddling in Mexico's politics.
</P>
<P>
   Young collected the wheelchairs from corporate sponsors in
California and buys over-the-counter medicines with money donated
to his group by Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Tellez Huerta, a Reynosa customs official, said Young
needs a special waiver from the Health Ministry to guarantee that
his medicines and syringes are safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to enforce the laws for the good of all Mexicans, not
just those in one place or another,'' Tellez said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Mexican officials said that Young could send the
shipment through the Mexican Red Cross. This time he balked,
reluctant to allow the government to decide where the aid should
go.
</P>
<P>
   ``This government should be ashamed of what it's doing,'' a
frustrated Young said.

 Informix CEO Finocchio Will Step Down
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Benny Evangelista &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Database software-maker Informix Corp. said yesterday that Bob
Finocchio will step down as president and chief executive in July
and be replaced by his chief lieutenant, Jean-Yves Dexmier.
</P>
<P>
   Dexmier, 47, joined the Menlo Park company in October 1997 as
chief financial officer and is currently vice president for
worldwide field operations.
</P>
<P>
   Finocchio, also 47, will remain with Informix as chairman of the
board. Relinquishing the posts he has held since 1997 will allow
him to spend more time with his family, although he will first
pursue a long-held dream of climbing Mount Kilimanjaro, the highest
point in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Tholemeier, an analyst with the FACS/Equities division of
First Albany Corp., was unimpressed by the sudden leadership
shuffle and said Informix and Dexmier still have a steep mountain
of their own to climb.
</P>
<P>
   Informix maintains only a sliver of the database market
dominated by Oracle Corp., Microsoft Corp. and IBM.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not going anywhere, they're sitting in the mud
spinning their wheels,'' said Tholemeier, who rates Informix as
underperform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I would invest in Informix, I'd buy another coffee shop
on the Embarcadero. You don't buy a minor player in a slow-growing
technology industry,'' Tholemeier said.
</P>
<P>
   Informix posted $52.3 million in net income on sales of $735
million for 1998, a sharp reversal from the $358.8 million net loss
the year before. Finocchio said in an interview yesterday that he
was proud that Informix posted six consecutives quarters of
operating profit because he and Dexmier ``worked very hard to fix
what was broken with the company and build on what we had here.''
</P>
<P>
   Dexmier, a native of France and a former CFO for Octel
Communications, said he plans to continue the firm's strategy of
marketing electronic commerce and data warehousing services in
addition to database software.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be all about building shareholder value from now
on,'' he said. ``It's a continuity of leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was made after the stock markets closed.
Informix stock closed at $7 per share, down 6 cents, on Nasdaq.

USA TODAY TO RUN ADS ON FRONT PAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif, Fla., Pa.)  (rk) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   USA Today, the newspaper whose bright colors and strong graphics
became a catalyst for the remaking of the industry's front pages a
decade ago, Wednesday announced plans to sell color advertising at
the bottom of its front page.
</P>
<P>
   The decision sets the flagship publication of Gannett Inc.'s
newspaper chain apart from virtually every major competitor; the
vast majority of publishers save their newspapers' display space
for news and features.
</P>
<P>
   ``With circulation as large as ours, to run a whole color page
without any advertising it is prohibitively expensive,'' Thomas
Curley, the president and publisher of the newspaper, said in an
interview Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   He and the paper's editor, Karen Jurgensen, both noted that the
inch-high color strip that runs under the front-page news columns
has for years been used to promote the newspaper or its web site.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jurgensen pointed out that ``It's always been promotional
space from the beginning. So in that sense it's really not
different.'' She added, ``We have run ads on the other section
fronts for years now. There has been no ill effect. In doing this,
we are not taking anything away from readers.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``Readers can tell the difference'' between
advertisements and news.
</P>
<P>
   European papers, including the staid Financial Times, the
British paper with growing American circulation, have long run
advertisements alongside page-one news. But newspapers in the
United States have shied away from this practice, although The New
York Times has long run a one-column, two- or three-line personal
classified advertisement on its front page.
</P>
<P>
   The official rate card of USA Today indicates that advertisers
can buy the one-inch color strip for a single day of the week, like
Mondays, for a year at a time. A year's worth of ads on Mondays,
Tuesday, Wednesdays or Thursdays would cost $1 million. Fridays
would cost $1.2 million, according to USA Today spokesman Steven H.
Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said that AT&AMP;T, Northwest Airlines and the Marriott
Corp. had signed up for a year's worth of ads in that space. The
advertising will begin Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   P. Anthony Ridder, the chairman and chief executive of Knight
Ridder, said in an interview Wednesday that he knew of no plan for
front-page advertising material in any of Knight Ridder's 31
newspapers, which include big-city dailies like The San Jose
Mercury News, The Miami Herald and The Philadelphia Inquirer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something I would encourage them to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``I see USA Today as _ it is a five-day a week
newspaper and it is really different from our newspapers or the
other Gannett newspapers, it's a national newspaper. Their model is
different. Their advertising is more a magazine's kind of
advertising than the typical newspaper advertising.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Orville Schell, the dean of the graduate school of journalism at
the University of California at Berkeley, said he did not find the
innovation an improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than the ads The Times runs at the very bottom of the
front page, no large paper has done this, within my memory,'' he
said. ``What is frightening for me about such changes is not the
specific change, but the direction they suggest.'' He added, ``My
view is that big serious newspapers of record _ or even not of
record _ are something like schools, churches, national parks. They
should not be completely enslaved to the imperatives of larger and
larger profits.''
</P>
<P>
   Curley said Wednesday that some American newspapers printed
page-one advertisements nearly until the outbreak of World War II.
He said he first had the idea of using the color strip on USA
Today's front page for advertising in 1994, when the newspaper
turned the space over to the Atlanta civic committee for free
promotions of the 1996 Summer Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   Curley said that the newspaper will add 1/8 of an inch of white
space between the color bar and the editorial material. &QL;

ALLEN QUESTROM TAKES THE TOP JOB AT BARNEY'S  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN.: Calif., Ill.)   By DANA CANEDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Barney's Inc., the luxury retailer known for basic
black everything, named a new chief executive Wednesday whose most
recent experience was running stores known more for affordable
sweaters and blue jeans.
</P>
<P>
   But the appointment of Allen Questrom as chairman and chief
executive of Barney's is not entirely surprising. The retailer,
whose Barneys New York stores are known for their snobbish sales
staffs and endless racks of size 2 dresses, has been expanding its
appeal beyond model types and the yuppie chic.
</P>
<P>
   Questrom is a former chairman and president of Federated
Department Stores, which owns Bloomingdale's but is mostly known
for mid-priced stores like Stern's that cater to everyone from men
shopping for sportswear to teen-agers in search of cheap khakis.
</P>
<P>
   No one is suggesting that Barney's will toss out the Gucci bags
and start selling faux leather purses to appeal to the masses.
Barney's majority owners said that the company remained foremost a
luxury retailer despite its history of financial troubles and
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   While the company says it will continue to cater to the high-end
shopper, Questrom, who joined the company's board in January, is
expected to teach the sales help to smile and to tweak the
merchandising mix, changes his predecessor initiated to lure new
shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allen has a background that would fit that strategy,'' said
Jeffrey Stein, a retail analyst with McDonald Investments. ``His
background is in moderate department store chains.''
</P>
<P>
   Questrom, 59, replaces Thomas Shull, who became president and
chief executive in May 1998 and led the company through its
emergence from bankruptcy in January. In February, Barney's said
Shull was departing and that the chain needed ``a growth chief
executive.''
</P>
<P>
   In what the company says is evidence of his confidence in the
chain, Questrom has signed a contract through January 2003 that
pays him no salary but gives him an ownership stake in the company.
No specific terms were disclosed. ``He is betting on the future of
Barney's,'' said David A. Strumwasser, a principal of Whippoorwill
Associates Inc., one of the company's majority owners.
</P>
<P>
   Retail industry experts and analysts who know Questrom from his
Federated days said he was well regarded for his merchandising and
service focus but that at Barney's the challenge would be to use
those skills to attract a wider range of shoppers without turning
off the stores' core customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge is not to dilute the appeal,'' said Kurt
Barnard, publisher of Barnard's Retail Trend Report. Questrom, he
said, must use his strengths as ``a merchandiser and marketer who
never takes his eye off the store, the customer or the investor.''
</P>
<P>
   Questrom was chairman and chief executive of Federated
Department Stores from 1990 until 1997. He later sued the company,
saying he was owed $47 million in additional compensation. During
his tenure at Federated, he brought the company out of bankruptcy
and led its acquisition of R.H. Macy &AMP; Co.. He also was president
and chief executive of Neiman Marcus from 1988 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The owners of Barney's said they would rely on his ``track
record in finance, operations and day-to-day management'' to move
the company forward. Since he joined the board, ``we have
increasingly turned to him for advice and counsel on issues ranging
from emerging designers to retail operations,'' said a joint
statement issued by Strumwasser and Douglas P. Teitelbaum, managing
partner of Bay Harbour Management, which along with Whippoorwill
Associates is the chain's majority owner.
</P>
<P>
   His predecessor has made huge progress in turning around the
troubled merchant, having closed unprofitable shops, cut debt and
taken advantage of the company's credit-card list for marketing
purposes. Sales, as a result, improved, increasing 10 percent last
year. Sustaining even half that growth will be difficult unless
Questrom can swiftly intensify a focus on service and new
merchandising, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, ``he's got very strong credentials,'' said Jeffrey
Feiner, a retail analyst with Lehman Brothers, ``and I really view
it as a positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Questrom, who declined comment through the company's owners,
said in the statement that his priority would be to ``unlock
Barney's full potential.'' The company operates seven Barneys New
York stores, including its landmark New York, Beverly Hills and
Chicago shops, and 13 off-price outlets. It employs 1,500 people.

<P>
   EASTERN CONFERENCE
</P>
<P>
   BUFFALO VS. BOSTON
</P>
<P>
   First round: Sabres swept Ottawa 4-0; Bruins defeated Carolina
4-2.
</P>
<P>
   Season series: Buffalo won 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers: 1.88 _ Dominik Hasek's goals-against average the
past three playoff years.
</P>
<P>
   Noteworthy: The Bruins won the last meeting between the teams in
overtime 2-1 after Buffalo had won four in a row. This figures to
be the lowest scoring series of the playoffs, as Hasek (.937 saves
percentage) and Boston's Byron Dafoe (.926) were two of the
dominant goalies down the stretch. The Bruins, who had 11 different
goal scorers in the Carolina series, have more depth and talent up
front than the Sabres and have been given a lift by 19-year-old
forward Joe Thornton. But Boston scored just seven goals in five
meetings with the Sabres (Hasek started four, Dwayne Roloson the
other). The Bruins were blessed with a home series when the Eastern
Conference's top three seeds _ New Jersey, Ottawa, Carolina _ were
eliminated, but home ice has meant little in the playoffs. The
Bruins haven't advanced past the second round since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Quoteworthy: ``A lot of teams have one superstar they're going
to rely on. Our star is our goaltender. He's the reason we win
hockey games.'' _ Buffalo's Michael Peca.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Buffalo in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH VS. TORONTO
</P>
<P>
   First round: Penguins defeated New Jersey 4-3; Maple Leafs
defeated Philadelphia 4-2
</P>
<P>
   Season series: They split four games, 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers: 1 _ the number of Canadian teams remaining in
the playoffs after first-round losses by Ottawa and Edmonton.
Montreal, Calgary and Vancouver did not make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Noteworthy: Penguins coach Kevin Constantine deserves some kudos
for keeping his players focused amid the franchise's financial
problems. The Pens rallied to eliminate the Devils and played four
games in the series without Jaromir Jagr. But Jagr was the
difference in the end, scoring two goals in Game 6 and setting up
two in Game 7. He needs to be the equalizer against the Leafs, who
have an edge in goaltending (Curtis Joseph over Tom Barrasso) and
defense and have more depth up front. Toronto was the league's
highest-scoring team during the regular season but managed just
seven goals in its four victories against Philadelphia. But Joseph
allowed only three goals in those wins. The Penguins aren't nearly
as physical as the Flyers, so the Leafs should have more room to
maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   Quoteworthy: ``I'm looking forward to the Toronto Maple Leafs
winning the Stanley Cup.'' _ Canadian actor/comedian Mike Myers.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Toronto in six games.
</P>
<P>
   WESTERN CONFERENCE
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT VS. COLORADO
</P>
<P>
   First round: Red Wings swept Anaheim 4-0; Avalanche defeated San
Jose 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   Season series: They split four games, 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers: 58-25 _ Detroit's playoff record since a
first-round elimination in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Noteworthy: This series might be the best of the entire
playoffs. The only problem is that possibly the league's two best
teams are meeting in the second round. Both improved their depth
before the trading deadline: Colorado obtained Theo Fleury and Dale
Hunter; Detroit added four players, including Chris Chelios and
Wendel Clark. And the teams are evenly matched, as evidenced by the
season series. But give the Avs the edge in goal, with Patrick Roy
over Chris Osgood, who has a sore knee. Detroit's attack, dormant
much of the season, overpowered Anaheim for 17 goals in four games,
including five by Steve Yzerman and three by Brendan Shanahan. Avs'
Joe Sakic (three goals, nine assists, 12 points) and Fleury
(3-8-11) are the playoffs' two leading scorers. Colorado will be
minus top checker Stephane Yelle (knee).
</P>
<P>
   Quoteworthy: ``We can't give up two games at home like we did
against San Jose. If we do that against Detroit, we're in big
trouble.'' _ Colorado's Roy.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Colorado in seven.
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS VS. DALLAS
</P>
<P>
   First round: Blues defeated Phoenix 4-3; Stars swept Edmonton
4-0.
</P>
<P>
   Season series: Dallas won 2-1-1.
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers: 0 _ Brett Hull's playoff goal total, with one
assist, in the Edmonton series.
</P>
<P>
   Noteworthy: If goalie Grant Fuhr plays as he did in Game 7
against Phoenix (35 saves in an overtime shutout), the Blues have a
shot to pull an upset. Games between these teams have been tight
the past two years, with St. Louis holding a 5-4-1 edge. The Blues
also have excellent speed. What they don't have is anything close
to Dallas' depth of scoring talent. Hull tipped that scale when he
left St. Louis and signed with Dallas as a free agent before the
season, setting up a nice subplot for this series. St. Louis twice
needed overtime to defeat the undermanned Coyotes. The Blues will
be facing a rested Dallas team and goalie Ed Belfour, who has
allowed two goals or fewer in 19 of his past 21 playoff starts. The
Blues' best chance to win in Dallas could be Game 1, with Stars
defenseman/captain Derian Hatcher still sitting out a suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Quoteworthy: ``We have to jump hard and now and often and quick.
We have to take advantage of what we've gained in winning four
straight.'' _ Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock on the Stars, who have
been off for a week.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Dallas in six games.

 &HT;    Wings, Avalanche in early showdown
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's not unusual for the raised elbows and sticks to
increase during an NHL playoff series, but the progression of
60-minute boil-overs by Detroit and Colorado in recent years has
created some uncommon occurrences.
</P>
<P>
   For example:
</P>
<P>
   _ Red Wings coach Scotty Bowman yelled obscenities out of a bus
window at Colorado's Claude Lemieux and his family in the arena
parking lot after Lemieux had sucker-punched one of his players.
</P>
<P>
   _ Then-Avs coach Marc Crawford said about his counterpart,
``Scotty is a great thinker, but he thinks so much that the plate
in his head causes interference in our headsets during the game.''
Bowman's follow-up slam: ``I knew your father before you did, and
he wouldn't be very proud of you right now.''
</P>
<P>
   _ And how about this: a six-on-six brawl, with goalies Patrick
Roy and Chris Osgood as the main event at center ice.
</P>
<P>
   A Detroit-Colorado series is the centerpiece of the playoffs
again, only this time it arrives early. Unlike their meetings in
the conference finals in 1996 and 1997, the owners of the last
three Cups meet in the second round, beginning Friday in Denver.
Other matchups find Dallas and Brett Hull going against his old
team, St. Louis; bankrupt Pittsburgh, coming off an upset of No. 1
Eastern Conference seed New Jersey, meeting Toronto; and Boston
facing Buffalo and goalie Dominik Hasek.
</P>
<P>
   But all take a back seat to the Wings and Avs, whose rivalry was
born in Colorado's Cup season of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the underdogs and they were the favorites, trying to
win their first Cup in 40 or 50 years,'' Colorado general manager
Pierre Lacroix said. ``We've both changed a few players but
basically we expect to see the same thing _ great hockey, great
games.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps also a collision or two. In '96, Lemieux punched
Detroit's Slava Kozlov from behind in Game 3 after Kozlov had
opened a 20-stitch cut on Adam Foote's forehead. In Game 6, Lemieux
earned a two-game suspension for a blindside check that broke Kris
Draper's jaw. The Wings screamed after the game, but Lemieux mused:
``Is that why they lost the game? Is anybody going to ask them why
they lost the game?''
</P>
<P>
   In '97, Colorado's Mike Keane, now with Dallas, called the Wings
``heartless'' and ``gutless'' and the feud between Bowman and
Crawford, now in Vancouver, escalated, with Crawford even scaling
the glass between the player benches to yell at Bowman.
</P>
<P>
   Before this season, Uwe Krupp left Detroit to sign with Colorado
as a free agent, although he missed most of the season with a back
injury. The teams split four meetings this year. There were no
fights but several stick penalties. Bowman and Bob Hartley,
Crawford's replacement, have been civil toward each other.
Colorado, which added Theo Fleury, and Detroit, which added four
players, including Chris Chelios, also drew the most attention
before the trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hatred's going to be a motivating factor for some,'' Red Wings
forward Brendan Shanahan said. ``You've got the two teams who
really improved themselves the most at the trading deadline. And it
excites some people that one of those teams is going to get knocked
out in the second round.

   BC-EVEREST-NYT (moved on Tuesday, May 4)
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Tuesday, May 4,
about an attempt to climb Mount Everest in 1924 misstated the month
that Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay reached the summit. It was
May 1953, not June.
</P>
<P>
   The article also misstated the age of Andrew Irvine, a
participant in the 1924 attempt. He was 22, not 28.
</P>
<P>
   The article also misspelled the surname of a film maker and
author who has climbed to the summit four times. He is David
Breashears, not Brashears.
</P>
<P>
   BC-SCI-YOUNG-KILLERS-NYT (moved on Monday, May 3)
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Monday, May 3,
about troubled adolescents referred incorrectly to some research in
the field. Information about which children are likely to ``break''
in stark ways comes from a growing number of ``psychological
autopsy'' studies of youthful suicides and from less formal studies
of adolescents who have committed murders, not ``less from studies
of adolescents who have commited murders.''
</P>
<P>
   BC-COKE-MARKETPLACE-NYT (moved on Tuesday, May 4)
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Tuesday, May 4,
about the Coca-Cola Company's bottling network, misstated the year
in which Coca-Cola Enterprises was spun off. It was 1986, not 1996.

MEDIAONE'S INTERNET ACCESS MADE IT ACQUISITION TARGET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been only 14 months since Robert Morse signed up for
high-speed Internet access from his cable company, MediaOne. But in
that time, his home computer has been transformed from an
occasional tool to ``an indispensible appliance,'' Morse said.
</P>
<P>
   Morse and his wife, Jane, now rely on the Internet for a host of
daily chores, from checking the weather to catching up on Red Sox
scores, buying Amtrak train tickets, doing their banking, catching
up with friends via e-mail, perusing rowing and sculling news, and
purchasing books.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before when I used a modem, everything was tediously slow,''
said Morse. ``Now the Internet is always there at home. Getting
information is much quicker.''
</P>
<P>
   Customers like the Morses are what the frenzied bidding for
MediaOne Group by some of the country's biggest companies was all
about. Since Philadelphia-based Comcast Corp. launched the auction
in March by offering $53 billion for the nation's fourth-largest
cable provider, AT&AMP;T Corp., MCI WorldCom, America Online, and
Microsoft Corp. all took a hard look MediaOne.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T came away with the prize Wednesday when it formally
announced that it had linked with Comcast to pay $58 billion in
cash and stock for the Colorado-based company. For agreeing to end
the bidding war, Comcast walked away with 750,000 AT&AMP;T cable
customers predominantly along the East Coast, for $3.5 billion,
with a three-year option to acquire another 1.25 million AT&AMP;T
customers for $5.7 billion. The option is based on AT&AMP;T completing
its acquisition of MediaOne.
</P>
<P>
   Comcast, which becomes the nation's third-largest cable company,
after AT&AMP;T and Time Warner, has also agreed to market AT&AMP;T local,
toll, and long-distance services to all of its cable customers.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T agreed to give Comcast its most favorable terms, akin to a
similar arrangement AT&AMP;T is completing with Time Warner cable.
</P>
<P>
   Among cable companies, MediaOne is the furthest along in
building the advanced infrastructure necessary to carry voice,
data, and video over the same wire.
</P>
<P>
   It's also in some of the country's most affluent markets, where
highly educated consumers are eager to sign on for high-speed
Internet access and extensive packages of telephone services.
Eventually, telecommunications companies hope to include services
like home security and additional television channels _ all on a
single bill.
</P>
<P>
   Already, 60,000 MediaOne customers in Massachusetts and southern
New Hampshire are paying around $30 a month for cable services (but
not including premium channels like HBO) plus $40 more for
unlimited Internet access. And some of those suburban customers are
spending from about $27 to $30 for local phone services which
include caller ID, call waiting, and other services that Bell
Atlantic charges extra. The trio of services from a single supplier
_ MediaOne _ could easily surpass $100 per month. Massachusetts is
MediaOne's largest market, with about 20 percent of the company's 5
million customers.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, AT&AMP;T chairman C. Michael Armstrong predicted that
after completing its acquisition of MediaOne, it would take on
regional telephone companies and other rivals with sharply lower
prices. He said AT&AMP;T will offer flat rates for customers using
multiple services, such as local and long-distance, Internet
access, and wireless telephone services, priced as much as 25
percent below competing services sold separately by competitors.
After the merger, AT&AMP;T will have 15.7 million cable television
customers, according to the Yankee Group, a Boston market research
and consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said AT&AMP;T might, for example, charge residential
customers of its local telephone service $6 per additional phone
line instead of the $12 national average.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we go forward we want to offer more services and package
them as bundles for consumers, on the simple market theory that the
more you buy from AT&AMP;T, the less it will cost you,'' Armstrong
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the regional Bell phone companies, fearful of losing
customers, are not sitting still. Just last month, Bell Atlantic
said it will offer similar high-speed Internet access over standard
telephone wires already in people's homes.
</P>
<P>
   A major advantage Bell Atlantic has is its ability to reach a
much broader audience, since telephone lines are everywhere,
compared to cable companies that have pockets or clusters of
subscribers in different parts of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Boston, for example, is served by Cablevision, which has yet to
offer high-speed Internet services to residents. Some parts of the
city can choose service from RCN Corp., the Princeton, N.J.,
company that has teamed with Boston Edison Co. to provide cable
television, Internet, and phone services.
</P>
<P>
   Still, compared to other parts of the country, Greater Boston
and southern New Hampshire remain the leading markets for both
high-speed Internet access and local phone services. Some real
estate agents say residential customers will pick one community
over the another depending on breadth of telecommunications
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I moved somewhere else, the town better have have
high-speed Internet access,'' said Morse. ``I will not go back to a
dial-up modem.''

DEATH AND DESTRUCTION ROAR THROUGH OKLAHOMA

<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY: noise was gone. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When he came out, the house was demolished and his two cars had
vanished. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, Chris Malone was huddled with dozens of
others at the First Baptist Church of Moore. He had taken his
family to the church because it had an underground area that he
thought would provide a haven. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the twisters were approaching, Malone heard people banging on
the outside doors. He let them in, and they huddled together. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the storm bore down on the area, they tried to reassure their
children by singing, ``Jesus Loves The Little Children.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When they stepped outside a few minutes later, they saw that the
tornadoes had demolished hundreds of homes next to the church and
had driven 2-by-4s into the cross on the side of their building. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the storm passed, people began to arrive at the church,
looking for shelter and help in finding their relatives. The church
would soon become a central meeting station for victims, relief
agencies, government officials and the news media. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As darkness fell Monday night, the storms moved to the north,
causing more destruction in Stroud, Okla., and later in Kansas. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The National Guard and other officials quickly moved into the
damaged areas near Oklahoma City, fearful of looting or gas leaks
that could lead to fires and explosions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Malone, a business manager at the church, began working on ways
to accommodate the relief effort. Miller returned to her home and
found that the twisters had missed it entirely. She put on her work
uniform and made it on time for her 3 a.m. shift at the local
convenience store. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison and his family went to a Marriott Hotel, which
provided free lodging for a few days. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Johnnie Lindsey went to her sister's house, which was
undamaged. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   People also started gathering at the First Baptist Church of Del
City, near another hard-hit area, about 4 a.m. Some tried to sleep
on baby mattresses that were moved from nursery cribs, but most sat
in stunned silence, neither crying nor showing much emotion. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By dawn Tuesday, the National Guard had cordoned off most of the
badly hit areas. Residents were required to show identification,
and some were allowed to sift through their homes _ or what
remained of them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two-lane roads soon were clogged with traffic backups that
stretched for miles. There was gridlock during the morning commute,
as drivers slowed to take in the carnage. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Lindsey reached her home Tuesday morning, her husband
immediately found the all-terrain vehicle that had been swirling in
the air; he put it in his pickup bed. She located her washing
machine, broken up and thrown far from the house. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She reached into the machine's tub and pulled out a load of
clothes, figuring she would need them later. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What struck many victims and observers was the capricious nature
of the tornadoes. On Lindsey's street, next to a mobile home that
was stripped of its aluminum, was a blooming honeysuckle bush,
apparently untouched. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nearby a tree was pulled completely out of the ground, with its
roots pointing to the sky. Next to it was an untouched mimosa tree,
lucky enough to be just beyond the tornadoes' path. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By early Tuesday, people from the community and local companies
were delivering loads of diapers, clothing, food, even cash. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Baptist church in Moore became a command center for the Red
Cross, federal relief agencies and dozens of news media outlets. A
slew of insurance company adjusters began to arrive and survey the
damage. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In late morning, anxiety stirred again when the skies darkened
and heavy rains fell. But by early afternoon Tuesday, the sun was
shining brightly, and the search-and-rescue efforts were gaining
momentum. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A woman was found alive near Lindsey's neighborhood, pulled from
debris near her house. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But at the Midwest Regional Medical Center in Midwest City,
medical workers and victims began to show the strain of the
tragedy. One nurse, who was busy tending to the injured, didn't
realize for hours that a relative was among the dead brought to the
hospital. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One man walked into the hospital gift shop at 2 p.m., saying
that his wife was in surgery and that he needed chewing gum. When
he realized that he didn't have his wallet, he lost his composure,
a hospital employee said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my god, I have nothing,'' the man reportedly said. ``I
don't even have a comb for my hair.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He walked out before the clerk could give him the gum. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Wednesday that at least 100 people remain
unaccounted for, and they asked the public to provide information
on the whereabouts of missing individuals. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds remain homeless, and many have few belongings. Some
children rang around area shelters Wednesday in their stocking
feet; their mothers wore house slippers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison, who saved his family and parakeet by rushing them
into the storm cellar Monday night, was walking through Moore with
a shopping cart Wednesday. He went to the makeshift store at the
Baptist church and picked up bags of cereal, canned goods, dog food
and a few stuffed animals for his children. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I'm going to do,'' he said, adding that he
was looking for a place to keep his family. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many volunteers continue to make food, hand out donations and
provide encouragement to twister victims. But after two days of
often keeping their emotions in check, people are losing some
control. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Diana Beal, a Moore resident who was helping at the Baptist
church, broke into tears Wednesday afternoon. She said she was
overcome by losing her home and by the outpouring of community
support. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe the number of people who are coming to help,''
she said, sobbing. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>

DEATH AND DESTRUCTION ROAR THROUGH OKLAHOMA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MITCHELL SCHNURMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY _ On Monday afternoon, before the tornadoes hit,
Johnnie Lindsey was enjoying her 31st birthday. It is a milestone
she will never forget. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Her husband was at work, and she was casually cleaning the
shelves in their mobile home and playing with their four young
children. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She had no reason to notice that dangerous storms were building
a few hours away in southwestern Oklahoma, where cool air from the
Pacific Ocean was colliding with a warm front from the Gulf of
Mexico. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey also had no reason to suspect that, within a few hours,
she would be at ground zero, clinging to her children and her
life. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At 4:15 p.m., the National Weather Service issued its first
thunderstorm warning for Oklahoma's Comanche County. Half an hour
later, it broadcast the first tornado warning. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey, like many involved in the disaster, learned about the
twisters from television. She was preparing a birthday dinner when
she heard the news bulletins. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At 6:19, a twister touched down north of nearby Chickasha, and
Lindsey went outside to have a look. She was quickly gripped by
fear. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched it come from my front door,'' she would say later
about the huge tornado, which appeared to be at least a half-mile
wide as it barreled toward her. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Her pickup didn't work, so she never considered making a run for
it. She put her children in a closet and covered everyone with sofa
cushions, pillows and comforters. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, the monster tornado was upon them, and the roof
and walls were gone. Huddled with her screaming children, she
glanced from beneath the bedding and saw the family's miniature
all-terrain vehicle swirling in the air amid flying debris. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A few moments later, the night was still and she heard her
husband's truck pulling up. He was yelling her name and screaming
for their children. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got them with me,'' she yelled back, and they ran toward
each other. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The storm system that would eventually spawn more than 70
tornadoes and kill at least 40 people had just struck a deadly blow
at Bridge Creek, Okla. Eleven fatalities have been confirmed there,
and a community has been destroyed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But nature's mayhem was far from done. Within a few hours,
thousands of lives would be changed forever. And for many, the
fallout would not be clear for a couple of days. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Weather officials say that what appeared to be one huge tornado
was probably four or five twisters in a single mass. The tornadoes'
size and wind speed, estimated at more than 200 mph, were a deadly
combination. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But what made the storms exceptional, officials said, was how
long the tornadoes clung to the ground. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most twisters touch down for fewer than five minutes, but this
one kept rolling for more than an hour, cutting a path of
destruction for 60 miles, officials said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The storm system triggered 174 tornado warnings, caused dozens
of deaths and hundreds of injuries and destroyed thousands of
homes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like Lindsey, Anne Miller began noticing the tornadoes when the
twister touched down in Chickasha and the swirling storm became a
fixture on TV. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Miller lives in a trailer park in the northern part of Moore, a
suburb of Oklahoma City that would be among the hardest hit. As the
tornadoes continued to move northeast, directly toward her, she and
her husband jumped in their truck and tried to outrun them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As they sped away, she stared at the storm through the rear
window and offered a running commentary on the action. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my god,'' she said to her husband. ``It got another tree.
Another power pole. Another car.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As Miller fled, Richard Hutchison held his ground. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tracking the tornadoes on TV, he stepped outside his Moore home
on 22nd Street at a few minutes after 7 p.m. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a wall of darkness,'' he said about the approaching
storm. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the twisters cut through power lines, ``the sky just lit up
like an explosion,'' he added. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison ran to his wife and two children, and rushed them to a
storm cellar in the middle of their frame home. He had time to grab
his dog and pet parakeet. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For about a minute and a half, he said, the twisters howled and
debris pounded the cellar door. Then the noise was gone. &QL;

``BABY J.R. WENT FLYING ... AND THE HOUSE DISAPPEARED''
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JENNIFER AUTREY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIDWEST CITY, Okla. _ The neighborhood wouldn't know how the
Yonnes baby died if his 3-year-old sister hadn't been able to tell
the story.
</P>
<P>
   Her grandfather, John Richmond, said little Josephine Yonnes
riveted nurses and doctors at the hospital Monday night as she told
how she climbed into a bathtub with her mother, father, twin
brother and four-month-old baby brother as a tornado roared toward
their house on Will Rogers Road.
</P>
<P>
   ```The big storm came and the house came open. Baby J.R. went
flying and Momma went flying and the house disappeared,' ''
Richmond said Josephine told him.
</P>
<P>
   A baby was found dead in the adjacent yard. The medical
examiner's confirmation hadn't come in Wednesday, but Richmond said
he knows it will be his grandson, Jeffery ``J.R.'' Yonnes Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The baby's mother, LaManda Kelly, 24, is in critical condition
at Presbyterian Hospital and hasn't been told about her baby's
fate. His father, Jeff Yonnes, remembers nothing of the storm. And
3-year-old twin Jeremy hasn't spoken, Richland said.
</P>
<P>
   So it was Josephine, through her grandfather, who helped the
Will Rogers Road residents piece together what happened to each of
them after their 5700 block suffered some of the worst damage from
Monday night's storms.
</P>
<P>
   Including the baby, all four confirmed fatalities in Midwest
City were found on their street. The bodies were so badly mangled
that for a while authorities mistakenly counted one woman's body as
two, said Lt. Gerald Beabout, Midwest City Police Department public
information officer. The victims' names hadn't been released late
Wednesday because next of kin hadn't been contacted.
</P>
<P>
   Will Rogers Road is bordered by busy Sooner Road to the west and
a small through-street, Center Drive, on the east. It is just south
of 15th Street, where dozens of businesses were obliterated. The
200-member Sooner Baptist Church on the northeast corner of the
block and the Peter Pan Small World day care across from it were
the only buildings left standing.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday was the first day that most residents were able to
return, looking for mementos among the rubble and discussing the
week's events with each other.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the one-story wood houses were rental properties and the
neighbors knew each other more by sight than by name. But they were
concerned about their neighbors. Rumors were rife. Many mistakenly
thought Kelly had been killed along with all the children in the
neighboring York house.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yorks are OK?'' said Dewey Young, 54, who lives down the
street. ``No way. We thought they were all dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Young drove his pickup 80 mph to a friend's storm cellar as the
tornado chased him and his wife, Leona, up Sooner Road. They
returned Wednesday to find only the four bathroom walls and a
kitchen counter with two unbruised bananas.
</P>
<P>
   The York family lived beside the church, where the children
loved to play even if they attended irregularly. Sooner Baptist
youth minister Deric Brock had been checking on the family. He was
able to tell neighbors yesterday that Tierra York, 8, was expected
to have permanent vision loss. Doctors had removed the two-by-four
embedded in the back of Justin York, 5, to leave no spinal damage.
Jacob York, 18 months, would also live.
</P>
<P>
   Brock said the Yorks' father, David Sean, 30, covered his
children as they lay in the bathtub. The next thing he remembers,
he was lying on concrete, the bathtub was gone, and the children
were scattered across fields of debris, Brock said.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor from across the street, Dave Dimick, 37, said he took
the York children to a hospital. Minutes later, Susan York came
home to find her family gone. Fearing the worst, she screamed their
names in despair, Brock said.
</P>
<P>
   Dimick had escaped uninjured. He had watched television until
the tornado was at Interstate 240 and Sooner Road. Knowing his home
was just north of Interstate 40 and Sooner, Dimick grabbed a
Hershey's with almonds, a Walkman radio and a metal chair and
opened a manhole in front a neighbor's house.
</P>
<P>
   He climbed in, stood on the chair in the nine-foot-deep manhole
and held the lid until it blew away. Then he crouched in the chair
until the storm blew by.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street, Evelyn Blanton, 82, rode the tornado like a
bucking bronco as it picked her up in her Ford LTD, spun her and
her puppies three times, then set the car down in a ditch. Blanton
was unscathed but her house was gone, said her niece, Gina Hulsey.
</P>
<P>
   Cecil Hawkins bore the brunt of the storm outside. He had a
storm cellar but waited until he heard the tornado coming before

 &HT;    Location is everything
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ He had done a good job of hiding it until Tuesday
night, but Greg Maddux hasn't pitched like himself this season.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux is 4-1, but he has given up a league-high 55 hits,
allowed opponents to hit .333 against him and watched his ERA take
off from 2.73 to 4.34 after he allowed eight runs to the Cardinals
on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been locating well,'' Maddux said Wednesday morning.
Why? ``I don't know. I'm still looking. . . . I've always started
off slow with location. Sometimes I go out there and don't pitch
very well and the other team doesn't hit very well either. Last
night I thought they hit very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux said it was all the two-strike hits that ate at him the
most. The home run to Mark McGwire? Not that bad a pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody else hit that ball, the right fielder probably catches
it,'' Maddux said. ``I made some mistakes, but my good pitches
didn't get hit. Last night they took them or fouled them off, that
was a good sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux said his movement on his pitches was finally where he
wanted it and that's what he chooses to focus on.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take the good out of the game and move on from there
instead of thinking about how bad it was,'' said Maddux, whose next
start is Sunday against Sterling Hitchcock and the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   Lefty blues
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones opened this season on a right-handed tear and has
struggled from the left side, his dominant side. A switch-hitter,
he came into Wednesday's game hitting .448 (13-for-29) from the
right and only .206 (14-for-68) from the left before showing some
left-handed signs of life, going 2-for-3 with a walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very inconsistent right now,'' Jones said. ``I've gotten
into some bad habits. I'm very disappointed with my contact through
the first month.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones stayed after the game on Tuesday night for extra batting
practice, using the time to concentrate on not pulling pitches.
None of his seven home runs have gone to the opposite field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to get some muscle memory working, hoping one day
it'll carry over into the game,'' Jones said. ``I haven't been
hitting very many balls in the gap in left center, or right center.
I'm in front of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's grand slam on Tuesday night may have played
second-fiddle to a homer he hit in batting practice earlier in the
afternoon. He launched a 500-plus foot home run off the scoreboard
above the 755 Club, denting one of the panels.

SECURITY LEAKS STILL POSSIBLE AT WEAPONS LABS, SCIENTISTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Scientists at the government's weapons laboratories
can still download nuclear secrets onto computer disks and walk out
without being checked, the directors of three of the labs told
Congress on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   New security measures put into effect in response to evidence
that a scientist suspected of spying for China transferred huge
amounts of secret data from a classified computer system into an
unclassified one at Los Alamos National Laboratory will not prevent
simple file transfers by scientists with security clearances, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   Their statements came in response to questioning from Senate
Energy Committee Chairman Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, who waved a
computer disk and expressed shock that the lab officials have still
failed to address a security problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there a monitor of individuals walking in and out that
would pick up if somebody had this in his pocket?'' Murkowski asked
the directors, as he held a disk in his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``No there is not,'' conceded John Browne, director of Los
Alamos. ``And the problem is that any floppy disk like you're
carrying, you can't tell unless you read all the contents whether
it's classified or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Murkowski expressed outrage at the way the Los Alamos case has
been handled by lab officials, by the Energy Department and the
FBI. Lawmakers said they were particularly angered that
investigators did not examine the office computer of the scientist,
Wen Ho Lee, until March, nearly three years after he first became a
suspect in the theft of nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Browne said Lee's computer was not examined earlier even though
a 1995 policy statement by Los Alamos notified employees that the
lab or federal government could audit or access office computers of
any employee without notice. Lee, along with other employees,
signed such a statement.
</P>
<P>
   But the FBI and Justice Department had decided that the policy
statement would not allow them to use evidence from a computer
search in court, Browne said.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials have previously stated that in 1997, they asked
the Justice Department to seek court authorization to monitor Lee's
computer, but Justice officials rejected the bureau's request.
</P>
<P>
   When the FBI did check his computer, it found that he had
transferred huge files containing millions of lines of computer
code from a classified system at Los Alamos into an unclassified
network. The codes that he moved contained the distillation of more
than a half century of American research on how to perfect nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Lee transferred files repeatedly from 1983 through 1995, and
there is evidence that someone accessed the files once they were in
the unclassified system, according to officials. There is no
evidence that the computer codes were handed over to China, but
officials say Lee jeopardized the security of virtually the entire
nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Lee has not been charged with any crime. His lawyer has not
returned phone calls seeking comment. Top officials in China have
denied any involvement in stealing nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Floppy disk drives on computers on the unclassified system have
been disabled or sealed in recent weeks, but not on the classified
computers, officials said. Energy Department officials said they
are now working on ways to eliminate the use of floppy disks on the
classified network.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Energy Committee is one of several congressional
panels investigating how the spy case was handled, and some new
information was revealed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who was hired at Los Alamos in 1978, came under suspicion
in 1982, when he made a telephone call to a scientist from Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory in California, who had been fired as
a result of an investigation into evidence that a spy had passed
neutron bomb secrets to China. The FBI investigated Lee and gave
him a polygraph test in early 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Lee gave deceptive answers to seven questions, Sen. Pete
Dominici, R-N.M., said. The FBI gave Lee an opportunity to explain
his answers and retake the test, and he passed the second
polygraph. The FBI then determined that he had cleared the
polygraph.
</P>
<P>
   Lee also cooperated with the FBI in its case against the
Lawrence Livermore scientist, officials said Wednesday, by
telephoning the scientist again at the FBI's request.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI polygraph report was included in a counter-intelligence
case file on Lee that was lost by the Energy Department's
Albuquerque office for several years, officials said. The
Albuquerque office had to hire an outside contractor to reconstruct
the lost file in 1992. Lee did not become the prime suspect in an
FBI criminal investigation until 1996.

 &HT;    Cast those romantic notions aside; fencing is hard work.
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The stance is slightly balletic, front foot pointed
straight forward, back foot turned at a right angle. I assume it
without requiring an orthopedic device, a fine start.
</P>
<P>
   The dress is straight from the Hannibal Lecter collection _ a
white coat that is just two straps away from being a straitjacket
and a bird cage that fits snugly over the head. I might borrow the
outfit the next time the dental hygienist tries to get at me.
</P>
<P>
   The language is like something stolen from a good wine list. En
garde. Epee. Maitre d'Armes. The list of French fighting words
can't be very long, but they're all here.
</P>
<P>
   The instructor, well, he has just raised his blunted foil to me
and said something along the lines of, ``You have sullied my sister
and for this you must die!'' Gene Gettler was only kidding. At
least he seemed to be. If he wasn't, I think I might well have
sullied my shorts.
</P>
<P>
   This is my introduction to fencing. It's not just for European
fops anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Many are called by the lure of swordplay, even those whose swash
may have buckled some with the passing of time. It's there from the
moment you duel a playmate with birch branches. It's reinforced
every time Luke Skywalker fires up his light saber. Gettler, the
master of arms at the Atlanta Fencers' Club, realizes this and is
not afraid to use it. Whatever works. Even if competitive fencing
is to big-screen dueling what a Roger Clemens fastball is to
anything thrown Kevin Costner's way in any of his baseball movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always something there that appeals to people, the
whole romantic notion of dueling for honor,'' Gettler said. He will
notice little spikes in membership whenever the occasional Zorro
movie is released or a Summer Olympics comes to town.
</P>
<P>
   As for me, I am the missing Musketeer. Call me Pathos, the sorry
one.
</P>
<P>
   I met with Gettler one afternoon in his small, sparse clubhouse,
located in the heart of downtown. This would be a beginner's
run-through, and believe me, I was frequently run through.
</P>
<P>
   Fencing is not merely a matter of taking up a weapon and
flailing away like you have to dispatch the entire king's guard in
three minutes. That technique stuff, which always gets in the way
of a good time, is thick in this sport. There is a proper way to
move, a proper way to turn your body in order to offer less of a
target, a proper way to hold the foil, and a whole menu of various
attacks and defenses.
</P>
<P>
   The movements are not automatic or natural. Like trying to pat
your belly and carve out another man's liver at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't tell anyone that fencing is easy to learn,''
Gettler said.
</P>
<P>
   But even if you are not inclined to take this to a highly
competitive level or go on any quests in the foreseeable future,
fencing has its upside. ``It gives some people a chance to do some
exercise if you're not inclined to run or go to the gym. It's a
physical workout. Fencing is very aerobic,'' Gettler said. And I
have the sweat stains to prove it. Spend a few minutes thrusting
and parrying and scampering around as if your life depended upon
it, you'll froth up nicely. Even if you never swing from a single
chandelier or slide down one ship's rigging.
</P>
<P>
   Having been shown all the little things that I do wrong, I
returned the next evening during regular club hours for a little
mock battle. Here, I was introduced to young Will Tauxe, a lanky
teen who has been about a year fencing. He was only too happy to
cross swords.
</P>
<P>
   The weapon of choice was the foil, the light weapon often handed
the beginner. It also is the most specific of fencing's arsenal,
with points awarded only for strikes to the torso. Unfortunately,
some of us have more torso than others.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to come clean: I fought like a scared rodent. Upon
further review, I believe I was more concerned with fending off
Tauxe's attacks than going on the offensive myself. I had a fairly
substantial height advantage, and that was good enough to score a
couple of accidental points. But Tauxe had mastered this one move
in which he flicked me on the shoulder with his foil, scoring a
series of nonfatal, annoying, mosquito-bite-like points.
</P>
<P>
   Fatigue also became an immediate factor. I don't remember Errol
Flynn calling too many 20-second timeouts, but I needed one in the
midst of our little first-to-five-points match. By the close of my
5-2 loss, I was drenched.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to beat Tauxe, there was only one other possible course
of action. I dueled his 14-year-old little sister, Genevieve. Now,
the height thing would be almost insurmountable. I claimed a 5-4
victory, although she would have won anything that went a minute
longer or would have required me to take one more breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're good,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're tall,'' she answered. My first fencing compliment,
backhanded as it might have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes five to seven years to become a national-caliber
fencer,'' Gettler said. ``That's a minimum of three (training
sessions) a week, two hours each. Maybe some fitness training,
along with a running program, some weight training and something to
work on your explosiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   It is too late for any of that. This Musketeer retires, glad for
the experience and grateful for a 1-1 record.

FORGING A FRIENDLY DEAL: HOW AT&AMP;T AND COMCAST CAME TO TERMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also AT&AMP;T-MICROSOFT) 
(bl) 
 By GERALDINE FABRIKANT and LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last Sunday afternoon, Comcast president Brian
Roberts was resting at his home near Philadelphia after an
exhausting week of negotiations. He had reason to be tired. After
making a costly $53 billion stock bid for MediaOne, the nation's
fourth largest cable operator, a month earlier, Comcast found
itself trumped by AT&AMP;T, which had muscled in with a $58 billion
stock and cash offer of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Comcast sought help from Microsoft the previous week, hoping the
software giant would dig into its $22 billion cash coffer to aid
the company in its bid. But even as Microsoft chief financial
officer Gregory Maffei met that week with Comcast at the offices of
Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell, Microsoft's law firm, the Comcast team knew
that Microsoft representatives were simultaneously meeting with
rival AT&AMP;T, indicating that Microsoft might only be using the talks
with Comcast as leverage in the AT&AMP;T negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Without support from Microsoft or America Online, another
potential ally, Comcast had little chance of winning. But AT&AMP;T
executives also knew it was wiser to strike a friendly deal with
the cable operator with which it hoped to do business with in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   That thinking set the stage for what was to be a conciliatory
call from an AT&AMP;T executive to Roberts that ultimately led to
Tuesday's settlement _ widely hailed as a savvy resolution for both
parties. AT&AMP;T, which already owns Tele-Communications Inc., the
nation's second largest cable company, gets MediaOne. But Comcast
too walks away with a prize: it acquires 2 million cable
subscribers outright and gets to manage franchises serving more
than 2 million more.
</P>
<P>
   Why was AT&AMP;T, eager to be the industry's goliath, willing to
give up control of more than 4 million subscribers? Company
executives did not talk publicly Wednesday, but one person involved
in the talks noted that it would behoove AT&AMP;T _ which is trying to
offer local telephone service through alliances with cable
companies _ not to alienate Comcast. ``Having Comcast, which
controls 6 million homes, or 10 percent of the cable industry, as
an avowed enemy for life was not smart,'' said the participant, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, there was still the potential for Comcast to drum up
support from other quarters and escalate the bidding war. But the
recent settlement puts an end to the specter of another round of
bids.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T plans to offer local telephone service on its wholly owned
Tele-Communications' cable lines and is working on a deal with Time
Warner. Adding Comcast's subscribers to that overarching plan would
be another coup. And indeed an agreement to offer Comcast
subscribers telephone service was part of the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the role played by AT&AMP;T chairman Michael Armstrong,
an investment banker involved in the negotiations who requested
anonymity said: ``Mike was smart enough to rise above the occasion
and get the deal done in a way that everybody could go home with
dignity. In a fast changing industry, he managed to keep
relationships with Comcast that insured they would work together in
the future.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not always the case. Viacom Inc.'s chairman Sumner
Redstone and QVC's then-chairman Barry Diller battled for months in
1993 over Paramount Communications. Each side continued to raise
its price far beyond what then appeared economically feasible,
forcing the ultimate winner, Viacom, to pay far more than Redstone
had initially intended. Moreover, Redstone and Diller remained
bitter to one another for at least a year after the battle ended.
</P>
<P>
   And after British Telecom lost the battle for MCI to Worldcom,
British Telecom immediately entered into a relationship with AT&AMP;T
that some observers said was aimed at damaging MCI/Worldcom.
</P>
<P>
   One reason AT&AMP;T and Comcast may have avoided friction is that
much of the negotiating was done directly between top level
corporate executives who are seasoned dealmakers in their own
right.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Roberts got a call from Leo Hindery, the president
and chief executive of AT&AMP;T Broadband and Internet Services, who
had been a chief dealmaker for the cable operator
Tele-Communications Inc. before it was acquired by AT&AMP;T last year.
``The question he raised was how to make it a `win-win' for both
sides,'' one person involved in the negotiations recalled. The pair
talked in earnest about a plan that had actually been kicking
around for awhile that would let Comcast buy or gain control of
more AT&AMP;T cable subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   That concept had been around for weeks and last Friday, as it
became clear that MediaOne was poised to accept the AT&AMP;T bid,
preliminary discussions began, according to two people involved in
the talks. Comcast and AT&AMP;T executives had been leery of talking
directly because AT&AMP;T's offer for MediaOne dictated that neither
could have discussions with any other potential bidders.
</P>
<P>
   But by Friday night, according to one participant in the
negotiations, a decision had been made that because MediaOne had
already singed confidentiality agreements with America Online and
Microsoft, the standstill provision was no longer in effect, and
preliminary talks between AT&AMP;T and Comcast had started. (An AT&AMP;T
spokesperson denied that there were any settlement talks before
Sunday.)
</P>
<P>
   In deals, politics count. And no one wants to be rebuffed. So
before Hindery actually picked up the phone to call Roberts,
representatives from AT&AMP;T's investment bank, Goldman Sachs, called
one of Comcast's investment banks, Lazard Freres. (Comcast is also
represented by Salomon Smith Barney.) Lazard, in turn, called
Roberts to say that Hindery would be phoning, said people close to
the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   And so the talks began. By 8 a.m. Monday both Hindery and
Roberts and their teams were at the New York offices of AT&AMP;T's law
firm, Wachtell Lipton Rosen &AMP; Katz, hammering out what was to
become the final settlement between the warring sides. Comcast
would get 2 million more subscribers for $9 billion, and management
over 2 million more cable homes, helping it accomplish its initial
goal of getting bigger. AT&AMP;T would acquire MediaOne, and the two
sides also agreed to a crucial goal of AT&AMP;T's: to offer telephone
service over Comcast's cable wires.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Comcast was finishing up the terms of its deal with
AT&AMP;T, reports that MCI Worldcom was interested in joining the
battle for MediaOne began making their way on Wall Street. The news
did little to sway the parties, but indeed quickened the pace of
the discussions, said one person.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T chief financial officer Daniel Somers, in particular, did
not take the MCI threat seriously but still wanted a quick end.
``Dan wanted to get the deal done, but they were testing'' Comcast,
said one person involved in the talks. ``Time was ticking.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, once the agreement was signed, Comcast
executives and their advisers went to the Waldorf Astoria, drank
champagne and celebrated their victory.

HOSPITALS SEE THE PHYSICAL SUFFERING OF THE STORM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JACK DOUGLAS JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY _ They began pouring in late on Monday, wearing
expressions of shock and pain, as nurses and doctors scrambled to
help them survive the injuries inflicted by tornadoes that had
trampled their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were covered in mud _ and blood,'' said Dale Askins,
chief trauma physician for Hillcrest Health Center, where about 150
storm victims were taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them were stunned and dazed by the suddenness of it
all,'' Askins said Wednesday from the hospital, one of several
where nearly 100 survivors remained under treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Medical personnel at Hillcrest, including one who arrived after
digging out of the ruins of his own home, saved most of the
victims.
</P>
<P>
   But four people died in the Hillcrest emergency room, including
a 4-year-old girl whose body was crushed by the fierceness of the
storms.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Downs, lead emergency room nurse at the hospital, said
many patients were surprised that even after being warned and
taking shelter, they were still swept away.
</P>
<P>
   One patient, Downs said, repeatedly cried: ``I got sucked out of
my car.''
</P>
<P>
   Another victim was asked what her address was. ``Well, I don't
have one anymore,'' Downs quoted the woman as saying. ``Then she
started crying.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the lucky ones were Allen Dunn, 78, and his 77-year-old
wife Dorothy. Wednesday, they were recovering in adjacent hospital
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   His broken right arm in a sling, Allen Dunn recounted the events
of Monday night, which he said began simply enough with a TV
weather alert.
</P>
<P>
   After the warnings grew more serious, Dunn said, he and his wife
went to their bedroom and sat on stools between their bed and a
wall, their heads covered by heavy blankets.
</P>
<P>
   They waited.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn said he heard a roar. ``It sounded like a dozen freight
trains. It was loud,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then the glass in our bathroom blew in. About that time, it
kind of went dark.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn said that when he awoke, he and his wife were on the floor
under debris, holding hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't see any walls. All we saw was sky,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn said he and his wife made it out of what was left of their
home of 10 years. They were immediately met by their frantic
grandson, who drove them to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his broken arm and his wife's cuts and bruises, Dunn
said, he and his wife were extremely lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were spared for some reason,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They haven't decided whether they will rebuild in ``Tornado
Alley.''
</P>
<P>
   Once they have recovered, Dunn said: ``We'll go out and rent an
apartment and rent a car. And start from there.''

<P>
   McGUIRE AIR FORCE BASE, N.J. _ With their families torn apart
and their homes turned to ashes, the first 453 of 20,000 Albanian
refugees arrived here from Macedonia on Wednesday, taking the first
step toward rebuilding their lives away from the battlefield their
homeland has become.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving on a chartered Tower Air 747 jet on Wednesday
afternoon, the refugees, many of them women, children and old
people, were taken to a newly fenced-in section of the neighboring
Fort Dix, where they were expected to remain for three to six
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   As the refugees filed past a receiving line on the runway, what
they had been through could be read in the way they clustered
together, and the missing generations: a young woman walked with an
old woman; a man alone carrying an infant; a mother shepherded a
gaggle of children, but no husband; teen-agers came with their
grandparents. Though beginning a new life, they carried no luggage.
</P>
<P>
   They were welcomed to the gymnasium by Hillary Rodham Clinton.
``We know that your thoughts are thousands of miles away, with
families or loved ones who are in Kosovo or in refugee camps,'' the
first lady told them. ``We will not let Mr. Milosevic succeed in
keeping you out of your home,'' she said, to the sustained applause
of the newcomers. Above her was stretched a banner. ``Mirsevini ne
Amerike,'' it said: ``Welcome to America.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the United States had pledged to take in the refugees
nearly a month ago, preparations to receive them here began in
earnest only last Friday, after a renewed exodus from Kosovo
brought 200,000 more people flooding into Macedonia over the last
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, private contractors, reservists and soldiers have
been working round the clock to outfit Fort Dix with bilingual
signs, medical clinics, dormitories for families of varying sizes
and children's playrooms. The stairwells, with high metal
banisters, have been lined with sheets of plexiglass to prevent
little children from falling through the wide spaces, while gates
now surround basement steps, also for safety.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, officials of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service fingerprinted the newcomers and issued them
identity cards, and gave them sweat suits and toiletries.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 24 hours, some 8,000 Kosovar Albanians fled to
Macedonia, said Marguerite Rivera Houze, undersecretary of state
for population, refugees and migration. A main refugee camp at
Stankovic was operating at triple capacity, Ms. Houze added. ``What
we're trying to do is to get people moved out very quickly,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure of the new outpouring, the Clinton administration
scrapped plans to initially restrict the refugees coming here to
those with relatives in the United States willing to sponsor them.
Instead, it is accepting refugees after only a preliminary
screening in Macedonia, and allowed nonprofit relief agencies to
sponsor them for resettlement.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Houze said that those arriving here on Wednesday had
suffered neither more nor less than the hundreds of thousands of
other ethnic Albanians who remained behind.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they were just luckier, or more eager. Those arriving on
Wednesday ``were the ones who were already psychologically ready to
move,'' said Roger Winter, executive director of the Immigration
and Refugee Services of America, a private charity based in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was one expectant woman who told relief workers she
was only seven months pregnant, and then appeared about to give
birth en route to the United States. ``We asked if there was a
doctor on the plane,'' Winter said. ``There were six.'' The woman,
it turned out, was dehydrated, not in labor.
</P>
<P>
   He said that when the plane touched down here, ending a journey
that began in Skopje 13 hours earlier, the refugeees erupted in
cheers and applause.
</P>
<P>
   While here, the refugees will undergo security, medical and
immigration exams, which are usually conducted before refugees ever
reach the United States. Afterward, nine nonprofit organizations
that resettle refugees will channel the newcomers into apartments
throughout the United States, said John Fredriksson, who is
overseeing the effort for the Immigration and Refugee Services of
America.
</P>
<P>
   Brig. Gen. Mitchell Zais, head of the Joint Command for Task
Force Open Arms, the military's name for the resettlement effort,
said he told soldiers here to welcome the refugees with
sensitivity, in sharp contrast to the treatment that Cuban refugees
had received just a few years ago, when they crammed into
Guantanamo Bay in an effort to force their way to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to welcome them to America as we would have hoped that
so many of our parents and grandparents were welcomed at Ellis
Island,'' Zais said.
</P>
<P>
   A second flight of about 400 Albanian refugees is expected to
arrive here Friday, while 100 Albanians with relatives who have
agreed to take them in will arrive Saturday at Kennedy
International Airport. Those coming in on Saturday will already
have gone through immigration, security and medical reviews in
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, two more planeloads of refugees are due to arrive at
Fort Dix.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Houze said that Washington had promised officials in
Macedonia that the United States would take 2,000 refugees a week
from the overcrowded camps. But with Fort Dix only geared to
accommodate up to 3,000 refugees, the United States government has
opened discussions with officials in Greece, Turkey and Bulgaria
about the possibility of sheltering refugees there, if only
temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, she said, the administration would like to conduct
immigration, medical and security screenings of the refugees
outside the United States, and to install them in homes found by
nonprofit agencies immediately on their arrival in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   While refugees who normally come to the United States have to
promise to repay the government the cost of their transportation,
the refugees arriving on Wednesday will be given six months after
they are formally admitted to repay the plane fares, about $350 per
person, Ms. Houze said. And if they return to Kosovo, the United
States will drop the debt and pay for the flight home.
</P>
<P>
   That wish did not appear to be so farfetched. As Mrs. Clinton
left the gymnasium, the refugees chanted ``U.S.A.,'' and then
switched to a new chant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Free Kosovo,'' they called, over and over again.

A NEIGHBORHOOD PARK DRAWS LITTLETON PILGRIMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ The television trucks and trailers streamed
out of town at the first report of tornadoes in Oklahoma. But even
without the encouragement of television coverage, people keep
coming in a steady stream to visit the vast impromptu memorial
created for the victims of the Columbine High School shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Lund was one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Although she did not know anyone hurt or killed in the mayhem at
Columbine two weeks ago, she felt compelled to join the quiet
pilgrimage on Wednesday, her 4-year-old son, Daniel, in tow.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is so sad _ everywhere you turn, you think of the kids,''
Ms. Lund said after walking pensively among the flowers, the
placards and the teddy bears. ``Suburban America is so
vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   The memorial is nestled in Clement Park _ on Rebel Hill, so
called because of the nickname of Columbine High, which it
overlooks. Constantly replenished by new bouquets, the shrines have
withstood two blizzards and torrential downpours. This was the
wettest April in Denver since 1900.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, even as the visitors continued to arrive, park
administrators began removing mementos and uprooting 13 crosses _
one for each of the victims of the two young Columbine gunmen _ in
a campaign to reclaim Rebel Hill, which had begun turning into a
muddy mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had people slipping and falling in the mud, and one lady
with heart problems had a medical emergency while trying to climb
the hill,'' Bob Easton, executive director of the local parks
agency, said as he watched more mourners walking in twos and threes
to a consolidated memorial site, on a nearby lawn within Clement
Park. ``We anticipate this will last all summer long.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers, hoping that all mourning at the park can gradually
be channeled into one tent by the start of summer, have begun to
thin the wave upon wave of offerings: Wilted flowers will be used
in compost, and fresh flowers will be made into bags of potpourri.
Initially the bags will be given to family members of the victims.
Later they will be sold to raise money for a permanent park
memorial to the 12 students and one teacher shot to death on April
20 by Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold; the two gunmen then killed
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers organized by the Colorado Historical Society have
started collecting and cataloguing truckloads of mementos at the
park: homemade art work, handwritten poems wrapped in plastic,
teddy bears, team shirts, votive candles and wind chimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody _ businessmen, schoolchildren, families _ people
from all walks of life have been moved to come here and leave
something,'' said Duncan McCollum, the Jefferson County Archivist,
who placed two of the offerings _ a pair of athletic shoes and a
pink terra cotta angel _ in a cardboard box.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Since this neighborhood park became a national focal point, it
has received visits from Vice President Al Gore, the duchess of
York and Martin Luther King III. President Clinton is expected to
see the park when he arrives here later this month.
</P>
<P>
   But it also a place where emotions, already raw in the wake of
the shooting, can spill over, as Greg Zanis, a carpenter from
Illinois, has discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Zanis, a rough-hewn man who runs a private charity,
Crosses for Losses, erected 15 handmade crosses on Rebel Hill. ``I
got calls about people spitting on the bad guys' crosses,'' he said
Wednesday, referring to the two inscribed with the names of Harris
and Klebold. ``A girl called me and said a person pushed her in the
mud because she left flowers at their crosses.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, at the end of the week, a father whose child was slain
simply removed the Harris and Klebold crosses. With anger growing,
Zanis tried to defuse matters by then removing the 13 others. In
response to public appeals, though, he erected 13 new ones
Wednesday, at a site approved by park officials.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to avoid controversy, he said, ``I'm just not going to
put up crosses for murderers anymore.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On the park's southern border stands Columbine High, a vast
crime scene that police investigators expect to return to the
school district by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   School Superintendent Jane Hammond has estimated that it will
cost the district, the largest in the state, $50 million to repair
the school, including $8 million for victim assistance counseling
for staff and students.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear where the money will come from. The state
Legislature adjourned for the year Wednesday night without setting
aside extra money for the district.

FIRST GROUP OF BALKAN REFUGEES ARRIVES IN US 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   McGUIRE AIR FORCE BASE, N.J. _ Shedding thick winter coats and
months of fear and deprivation, 453 refugees from the ethnic strife
of the Balkans strode, shuffled, or were carried onto US soil
Wednesday. They are the first of 20,000 people from the war-torn
region expected to arrive in this country over the next three
months.
</P>
<P>
   After a 13-hour journey that began in darkness in the Macedonian
capital, Skopje, the refugees landed at 4:12 p.m. in a chartered
Tower Air 747. They emerged squinting in a hot, bright day, but
soon began to smile and wave in response to the applause of US
servicemen and the urgings of photographers.
</P>
<P>
   They came in all ages and sizes. First to deplane were a
half-dozen vigorous men, shoulders squared, who shook hands with US
officials lined up along the red carpet to greet them. Then the
flow briefly ceased, as a bulky older woman struggled to assist a
small child down the steep stairs.
</P>
<P>
   A man in traditional white-knit skullcap paused time and again
to press his right hand against his heart and nod in thanks.
</P>
<P>
   A grandmother in a trenchcoat and Soviet-era shoes herded a
gaggle of young boys. How many were in her own charge was
impossible to tell, as one family crowded and merged into the next.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the State Department, the Department of
Health and Human Services, and the military greeted the refugees on
the tarmac at McGuire. The refugees then were whisked by bus to
neighboring Fort Dix, where, in the gymnasium converted into a
receiving center, they were welcomed to the United States by first
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Also at the receiving center, they were offered cots, boxed
dinners, and play areas for the children while they waited for an
initial meeting with officials of the US and Immigration and
Naturalization Services who issued them temporary identity cards.
Following this, they were assigned to lodgings, shown around
communal areas prepared for prayer and play during their stay at
Fort Dix, and given new clothes, soap, and towels.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees who arrived Wednesday are expected to stay at Fort
Dix for two to three weeks, receiving health care, orientation to
the United States, and English lessons while efforts are made to
match them with sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Nine residential buildings formerly used as military barracks,
two dining facilities, a medical clinic and a chapel have been
prepared for the newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   Another 747 is scheduled to arrive Friday and two more are due
next week _ all carrying refugees with no relatives or other
sponsors in the United States. Refugees who have sponsors are being
screened in Macedonia and will go directly to the homes of their
hosts without having to pass through Fort Dix.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials say Fort Dix can now accommodate up to
3,000 refugees at a time. A military source at the Fort said
Wednesday that an ongoing project to raze old barracks was
suspended last week ``until we get this sorted out.''
</P>
<P>
   In a teleconference held Wednesday by the US Catholic Conference
_ a leading organization in refugee resettlement _ Dr. Patricia
Maloof said that while current plans are for 20,000 refugees to
come to the United States within two to three months, ``This is a
fluid situation.'' It could change rapidly and speed up as needed
to relieve the crisis in Macedonia, where refugee camps are
overflowing, living conditions deteroriating, and communal tensions
rising rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   US officials confirmed that the speed with which refugees will
be brought here will be influenced by the situation in Macedonia, a
neighbor of Kosovo, which already has taken in about 200,000
refugees. Wednesday, as it's done several times before, it closed
its border to more.
</P>
<P>
   At Fort Dix, refugees will be required to remain within a fenced
and patrolled area, and members of the public and media wil be able
to reach them only through interviews arranged by government
officials. No contact between media and refugees was allowed
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking forward to the challenge of giving some safety
and security to these people who have been desperately lacking
it,'' said Michael Kharfen, a spokesman for the Department of
Health and Human Services. ``They have been displaced from their
homes, some have been physically abused, they may be emotionally
traumatized.''
</P>
<P>
   Kharfen said that Muslim clergy in the area have agreed to
assist the refugess, most of whom are ethnic Albanians whose
families are historically Muslim. He said there are also Orthodox
Christians in the groups, and that priests are being contacted on
their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials stressed the temporary nature of the
shelter at Fort Dix in particular and in the US in general, despite
the growing conviction among non-governmental relief workers that
few of the refugees evacuated to countries far from their homeland
will return there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think they will come to the United States, catch their
breath, hopefully we'll resolve this in a short period of time, and
they'll return,'' said Marguerite Houze, a deputy assistant
secretary of state, who runs the US Bureau of Population, Refugees
and Migration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mindset is so determined right now for them to go home,''
she said. ``It's hard to speculate what their mindset will be in
six months or a year from now. We'll just have to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the Balkans exiles are being admitted to the United
States under regular refugee regulations, with no special
conditions, they all will be eligible to apply for permanent
resident status.
</P>
<P>
   Houze said the influx is not straining the US capacity to accept
refugees because there was already an ongoing refugee program,
resettling about 78,000 people a year here, before the Kosovo
exodus began. ``It happens all the time,'' she said, ``Just not
this many this fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Maloof, the Catholic Conference official, said at least three
cases in the first group of refugees have resettlement
possibilities in Greater Boston, but said she could not elaborate
in the number of people involved or their connections in the area.
New York City, Chicago, Dallas Fort Worth, and Arlington, Virginia
all may receive substantial nubmers of refugees, she said.

SECURITY LEAKS STILL POSSIBLE AT WEAPONS LABS, SCIENTISTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing; one take)  (rm) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Scientists at the government's weapons laboratories
can still download nuclear secrets onto computer disks and walk out
without being checked, the directors of three of the labs told
Congress on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   New security measures put into effect in response to evidence
that a scientist suspected of spying for China transferred huge
amounts of secret data from a classified computer system into an
unclassified one at Los Alamos National Laboratory will not prevent
simple file transfers by scientists with security clearances, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   Their statements came in response to questioning from Senate
Energy Committee Chairman Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, who waved a
computer disk and expressed shock that the lab officials have still
failed to address a security problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there a monitor of individuals walking in and out that
would pick up if somebody had this in his pocket?'' Murkowski asked
the directors, as he held a disk in his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``No there is not,'' conceded John Browne, director of Los
Alamos. ``And the problem is that any floppy disk like you're
carrying, you can't tell unless you read all the contents whether
it's classified or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Murkowski expressed outrage at the way the Los Alamos case has
been handled by lab officials, by the Energy Department and the
FBI. Lawmakers said they were particularly angered that
investigators did not examine the office computer of the scientist,
Wen Ho Lee, until March, nearly three years after he first became a
suspect in the theft of nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Browne said Lee's computer was not examined earlier even though
a 1995 policy statement by Los Alamos notified employees that the
lab or federal government could audit or access office computers of
any employee without notice. Lee, along with other employees,
signed such a statement.
</P>
<P>
   But the FBI and Justice Department had decided that the policy
statement would not allow them to use evidence from a computer
search in court, Browne said.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials have previously stated that in 1997, they asked
the Justice Department to seek court authorization to monitor Lee's
computer, but Justice officials rejected the bureau's request.
</P>
<P>
   When the FBI did check his computer, it found that he had
transferred huge files containing millions of lines of computer
code from a classified system at Los Alamos into an unclassified
network. The codes that he moved contained the distillation of more
than a half century of American research on how to perfect nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Lee transferred files repeatedly from 1983 through 1995, and
there is evidence that someone accessed the files once they were in
the unclassified system, according to officials. There is no
evidence that the computer codes were handed over to China, but
officials say Lee jeopardized the security of virtually the entire
nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Lee has not been charged with any crime. His lawyer has not
returned phone calls seeking comment. Top officials in China have
denied any involvement in stealing nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Floppy disk drives on computers on the unclassified system have
been disabled or sealed in recent weeks, but not on the classified
computers, officials said. Energy Department officials said they
are now working on ways to eliminate the use of floppy disks on the
classified network.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Energy Committee is one of several congressional
panels investigating how the spy case was handled, and some new
information was revealed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who was hired at Los Alamos in 1978, came under suspicion
in 1982, when he made a telephone call to a scientist from Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory in California, who had been fired as
a result of an investigation into evidence that a spy had passed
neutron bomb secrets to China. The FBI investigated Lee and gave
him a polygraph test in early 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Lee gave deceptive answers to seven questions, Sen. Pete
Dominici, R-N.M., said. The FBI gave Lee an opportunity to explain
his answers and retake the test, and he passed the second
polygraph. The FBI then determined that he had cleared the
polygraph.
</P>
<P>
   Lee also cooperated with the FBI in its case against the
Lawrence Livermore scientist, officials said Wednesday, by
telephoning the scientist again at the FBI's request.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI polygraph report was included in a counter-intelligence
case file on Lee that was lost by the Energy Department's
Albuquerque office for several years, officials said. The
Albuquerque office had to hire an outside contractor to reconstruct
the lost file in 1992. Lee did not become the prime suspect in an
FBI criminal investigation until 1996.

 &HT;    Hispanic feats lifted from footnotes
 &HT;    By Mary Ellen Flannery
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Sure, you've heard of J. Robert
Oppenheimer, the man who ran Los Alamos National Laboratory and
told the government it should drop the first atomic bomb on
Hiroshima. But have you heard of Luis Alvarez?
</P>
<P>
   Neither have most Palm Beach County students. But Alvarez worked
with the Manhattan Project and, in 1945, sat in a plane 30,000 feet
above Japan and watched his work devastate that city. In 1968, he
won a Nobel Prize in physics for his discovery of numerous atomic
particles.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of many Hispanic names from Florida's textbooks was
noted last year by state legislators who required school districts
to teach the contributions Hispanics made to the United States.
Four years earlier, they ordered districts to teach about
African-American contributions and the Holocaust. In response, Palm
Beach County educators went to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here technically because of the law, but that's not our
mission,'' said Lhisa Almashy, a resource teacher in Hispanic/Latin
American studies. ``It's so our children, as they grow up, can have
an identity. . . . It's not just to recognize the contributions,
but to celebrate and validate them.''
</P>
<P>
   Next year, when local middle-school science teachers get to
their lessons on atomic energy, they'll be encouraged to mention
both Alvarez and Oppenheimer. And when their social studies peers
teach lessons on American currency, they can mention its roots in
the Spanish peso. And right about this time next year, they can
talk knowledgeably about Cinco de Mayo (the anniversary of Mexico's
May 5, 1862, victory against French invaders).
</P>
<P>
   The new curriculum doesn't replace anything. Nor does it require
spending days on Hispanic lessons only, said Carlos Diaz, a Florida
Atlantic University professor who developed some of the lessons for
Palm Beach County. Instead, it allows the teacher to mention
Hispanic people at natural times, during regular lessons.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic students make up about 18 percent of all students in
Palm Beach County, and that number is expected to grow. A
population study conducted by Florida International University and
commissioned by The Palm Beach Post found that by 2025, Hispanics
will have become the county's largest ethnic group, 44.9 percent of
the population. The number probably will be larger in the school
district.
</P>
<P>
   ``To not have a curriculum that includes Hispanic-Americans is
incomprehensible to me,'' Diaz said. ``Inclusion in the curriculum
implies legitimacy. It is an affirmation that you exist. . . . Some
people argue that this is tokenism. Let me suggest that telling the
truth, the whole truth, is reality.''

FIRST GROUP OF BALKAN REFUGEES ARRIVES IN US 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   McGUIRE AIR FORCE BASE, N.J. _ Shedding thick winter coats and
months of fear and deprivation, 453 refugees from the ethnic strife
of the Balkans strode, shuffled, or were carried onto US soil
Wednesday. They are the first of 20,000 people from the war-torn
region expected to arrive in this country over the next three
months.
</P>
<P>
   After a 13-hour journey that began in darkness in the Macedonian
capital, Skopje, the refugees landed at 4:12 p.m. in a chartered
Tower Air 747. They emerged squinting in a hot, bright day, but
soon began to smile and wave in response to the applause of US
servicemen and the urgings of photographers.
</P>
<P>
   They came in all ages and sizes. First to deplane were a
half-dozen vigorous men, shoulders squared, who shook hands with US
officials lined up along the red carpet to greet them. Then the
flow briefly ceased, as a bulky older woman struggled to assist a
small child down the steep stairs.
</P>
<P>
   A man in traditional white-knit skullcap paused time and again
to press his right hand against his heart and nod in thanks.
</P>
<P>
   A grandmother in a trenchcoat and Soviet-era shoes herded a
gaggle of young boys. How many were in her own charge was
impossible to tell, as one family crowded and merged into the next.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the State Department, the Department of
Health and Human Services, and the military greeted the refugees on
the tarmac at McGuire. The refugees then were whisked by bus to
neighboring Fort Dix, where, in the gymnasium converted into a
receiving center, they were welcomed to the United States by first
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Also at the receiving center, they were offered cots, boxed
dinners, and play areas for the children while they waited for an
initial meeting with officials of the US and Immigration and
Naturalization Services who issued them temporary identity cards.
Following this, they were assigned to lodgings, shown around
communal areas prepared for prayer and play during their stay at
Fort Dix, and given new clothes, soap, and towels.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees who arrived Wednesday are expected to stay at Fort
Dix for two to three weeks, receiving health care, orientation to
the United States, and English lessons while efforts are made to
match them with sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Nine residential buildings formerly used as military barracks,
two dining facilities, a medical clinic and a chapel have been
prepared for the newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   Another 747 is scheduled to arrive Friday and two more are due
next week _ all carrying refugees with no relatives or other
sponsors in the United States. Refugees who have sponsors are being
screened in Macedonia and will go directly to the homes of their
hosts without having to pass through Fort Dix.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials say Fort Dix can now accommodate up to
3,000 refugees at a time. A military source at the Fort said
Wednesday that an ongoing project to raze old barracks was
suspended last week ``until we get this sorted out.''
</P>
<P>
   In a teleconference held Wednesday by the US Catholic Conference
_ a leading organization in refugee resettlement _ Dr. Patricia
Maloof said that while current plans are for 20,000 refugees to
come to the United States within two to three months, ``This is a
fluid situation.'' It could change rapidly and speed up as needed
to relieve the crisis in Macedonia, where refugee camps are
overflowing, living conditions deteroriating, and communal tensions
rising rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   US officials confirmed that the speed with which refugees will
be brought here will be influenced by the situation in Macedonia, a
neighbor of Kosovo, which already has taken in about 200,000
refugees. Wednesday, as it's done several times before, it closed
its border to more.
</P>
<P>
   At Fort Dix, refugees will be required to remain within a fenced
and patrolled area, and members of the public and media wil be able
to reach them only through interviews arranged by government
officials. No contact between media and refugees was allowed
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking forward to the challenge of giving some safety
and security to these people who have been desperately lacking
it,'' said Michael Kharfen, a spokesman for the Department of
Health and Human Services. ``They have been displaced from their
homes, some have been physically abused, they may be emotionally
traumatized.''
</P>
<P>
   Kharfen said that Muslim clergy in the area have agreed to
assist the refugess, most of whom are ethnic Albanians whose
families are historically Muslim. He said there are also Orthodox
Christians in the groups, and that priests are being contacted on
their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials stressed the temporary nature of the
shelter at Fort Dix in particular and in the US in general, despite
the growing conviction among non-governmental relief workers that
few of the refugees evacuated to countries far from their homeland
will return there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think they will come to the United States, catch their
breath, hopefully we'll resolve this in a short period of time, and
they'll return,'' said Marguerite Houze, a deputy assistant
secretary of state, who runs the US Bureau of Population, Refugees
and Migration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mindset is so determined right now for them to go home,''
she said. ``It's hard to speculate what their mindset will be in
six months or a year from now. We'll just have to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the Balkans exiles are being admitted to the United
States under regular refugee regulations, with no special
conditions, they all will be eligible to apply for permanent
resident status.
</P>
<P>
   Houze said the influx is not straining the US capacity to accept
refugees because there was already an ongoing refugee program,
resettling about 78,000 people a year here, before the Kosovo
exodus began. ``It happens all the time,'' she said, ``Just not
this many this fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Maloof, the Catholic Conference official, said at least three
cases in the first group of refugees have resettlement
possibilities in Greater Boston, but said she could not elaborate
in the number of people involved or their connections in the area.
New York City, Chicago, Dallas Fort Worth, and Arlington, Virginia
all may receive substantial nubmers of refugees, she said.

AFTER A RECOUNT, LINCOLN PASSES CADILLAC AS NATION'S BEST-SELLING
LUXURY CAR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Here in the Motor City, automakers take their annual
battles for sales titles pretty seriously. Perhaps the most
fiercely fought feud has been between Cadillac and Lincoln, as
Cadillac struggled to keep its 57-year winning streak as the
nation's best-selling luxury car.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Cadillac acknowledged pulling out all the stops to
hold on to the title. After reporting almost unbelievable sales
results in December, Cadillac eked out a come-from-behind victory
by just 222 cars.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the numbers were pulled from thin air. On Wednesday,
General Motors Corp. said that its Cadillac division sold 4,773
fewer cars in December than it had reported at the time,
acknowledging four months late that Lincoln was the nation's
best-selling luxury car for the first time since 1939. The December
sales results were ``overstated due to an improper reporting
process,'' GM said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the Cadillac of overstatements.
</P>
<P>
   GM said it had found the truth after an internal audit, and that
it had taken disciplinary action. The company did not say what that
action was or how many people were involved. GM said the sales
overstatement had not affected the company's financial reporting,
and that revenue, income and production figures were correctly
reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning in the marketplace obviously is very important to us,
but nothing is more important than our integrity,'' said Roy S.
Roberts, GM's vice president and group executive for North American
vehicle sales, service and marketing. ``General Motors will assure
the process for reporting dealer sales will be accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   The competition for the auto sales titles is fierce because the
winners often widely advertise their victories. Jim Farmer, a GM
spokesman, said the company had not said in advertisements this
year that Cadillac was last year's best-selling luxury car.
</P>
<P>
   But after journalists had predicted that Lincoln was about to
dethrone Cadillac, GM early this year distributed a promotional
mailer, with a picture of President Harry S. Truman holding a mock
version of the The Chicago Daily Tribune with the headline,
``LINCOLN DEFEATS CADILLAC!'' Inside it said, ``History has a
strange way of repeating itself.'' (The reference, of course, was
to the that newspaper's erroneous headline _ ``Dewey Defeats
Truman'' _ in its early edition on the day after the 1948
Presidential election.)
</P>
<P>
   Back in November, it looked as if Cadillac was out of the sales
race. Lincoln, which had last beat Cadillac in 1939, had sold
nearly 7,000 more cars and trucks than GM's luxury division as of
December 1. So Cadillac slapped on rebates and other sales
incentives, mailed out promotions to current Cadillac owners
encouraging them to trade in their old models, gave discounts to
employees and retired employees, and gave sales people a bonus for
each new Cadillac they sold.
</P>
<P>
   The result, GM claimed at the time: Cadillac 187,343, Lincoln
187,121. Cadillac won by a nose.
</P>
<P>
   Auto journalists immediately raised red flags. They were even
more skeptical when GM said that Cadillac sales plunged 38 percent
the next month. They assumed GM had counted sales that took place
in early January as December sales. GM's internal auditors then
began digging, according to Farmer, the GM spokesman, and the
problem turned out to be bigger than that. ``It is a combination of
an internal control breakdown and some overzealous people,'' said
Farmer, who refused to provide further details.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln said its dealers were disappointed not to be able to
claim the title but praised GM for its candor. ``Our dealers would
have loved to have had the opportunity'' to call Lincoln the luxury
sales leader, said spokesman Jim Trainor. ``They were really
disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Lincoln released a statement praising GM for
setting the record straight. ``This action by Cadillac exemplifies
the integrity we've always said is the basis for a luxury brand. It
is another example of what makes this rivalry so great.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the announcement shocked the auto industry. In Detroit,
it was as if the class president had been caught cheating on a
final exam. Auto industry observers said the embarrassing
disclosure showed how troubled the Cadillac division is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cadillac has a tremendous number of problems today and this is
just a manifestation,'' said Keith Crain, publisher of Automotive
News, a leading trade journal. ``They are not the standard of the
world and they haven't been for a long time,'' he said, invoking
Cadillac's famous pre-war advertising slogan.
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac's sales have been sliding for years, and until
Wednesday they seemed to continue their swoon: GM said Cadillac
sales were down 14.9 percent so far this year, to 41,503. That left
Cadillac behind Lincoln's 48,896. On Wednesday, GM restated
Cadillac sales for the last five months to account for the audit's
results, and voila, Cadillac sales for the year had climbed 6.4
percent, to 51,914, edging ahead of Lincoln once again.
</P>
<P>
   But Mercedes and Lexus have outsold them both, with sales of
56,716 and 56,678 respectively.

JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN KILLED IN TIJUANA CARJACKING  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.) (rk) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ A Japanese businessman who, like thousands of
executives, commuted from the United States each day to work at a
factory on the Mexican side of the border, has been shot to death
in Tijuana in an attempted carjacking, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Jiro Sayama, 50 years old, was slain on Tuesday afternoon as he
scuffled with two assailants who forced him from his car in an
industrial section of Tijuana, which faces San Diego, said Marcia
Coronado, a spokeswoman for the Baja California state attorney
general.
</P>
<P>
   Two youths, Hugo Buenrostro Ramirez, 15, and Jorge Roman
Frausto, 21, have been arrested and charged with the murder, police
officials said Wednesday. The two young men were identified by
several eyewitnesses to the killing, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Organized crime including carjackings and kidnappings has surged
in recent years across Mexico. Only a handful of foreigners,
however, have been victimized.
</P>
<P>
   In Tijuana in 1996, Mamoru Konno, the president of Sanyo Video
Components, a San Diego company, was seized and held for nine days.
He was released after his company paid a ransom.
</P>
<P>
   The Baja California police were anxious to dispel reports that
Sayama's death had occurred during an attempt at another
kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   Sayama was one of the Japanese managers who ran an assembly
plant in Tijuana employing 300 workers. The plant is owned by
Mogami America of National City, Calif., a subsidiary of Pioneer
Speakers, said Kim Minakoshi, an accountant at Mogami's Tijuana
plant. The plant produces parts for stereo speakers, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sayama, who lived in the United States for 20 years, was on his
way back from the Tijuana plant in his 1993 Honda Accord at about
3:30 p.m. on Tuesday, Ms. Minakoshi said. He was wearing a Mogami
company uniform and traveling with his windows down, she said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Mexican police, the two youths confessed that
they had met in a Tijuana shopping center and laid plans to steal a
car. When one armed youth approached Sayama at a stoplight, he got
out of his car and fought with the attacker. Roman fired the two
shots that hit Sayama, the police charged.

BOMBING MEMORIES SHAPE RESPONSE TO NEW TRAGEDY
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY _ The question nagged at rescue workers and
government officials as they spent the first grueling hours
throwing blankets over victims and maneuvering around crackling
power lines to survey the tornado's massive damage.
</P>
<P>
   How could such destruction visit Oklahoma City again?
</P>
<P>
   Barely four years after a bomb devastated downtown Oklahoma City
in the country's deadliest terrorist attack, many people have found
themselves facing the same shocking realities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Few towns have seen anything as horrific as this,'' Gov. Frank
Keating said Wednesday, his shoes caked with mud as he talked with
dozens of the newly homeless at the First Baptist Church of Moore.
``But we've done it before and will do it again. We'll dig
ourselves out of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma City addressed the bombing tragedy in several ways that
could ultimately speed emotional and financial recovery from the
tornadoes that left thousands homeless, more than 500 injured and
at least 38 dead this week, community leaders say.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is difficult to measure, many city leaders say a
powerful community spirit bred partly from the April 19, 1994,
bombing of the Murrah Building is carrying Oklahoma City through
its latest nightmare. That's evident in the mobilization of
thousands of volunteers and the spontaneous acts of giving this
week, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Alliances that grew out of the bombing's aftermath are also at
work. The state of Oklahoma and nonprofit groups created the
Resource Committee, to steers donations to families affected by the
bombing who can't afford to put their children through college.
That group plans to help the tornado victims as well, Keating said.
</P>
<P>
   And new disaster relief strategies, such as the American Red
Cross' methods of dispatching numerous counseling teams to ease the
mental anguish of victims and rescue workers, were on display in
Moore, one of the hardest-hit suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, at least 20 counselors were trudging through ruined
neighborhoods in Moore and creating ``private spaces'' at shelters
for immediate therapy. More counselors are on the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The larger counselor volunteer base we're using today came out
of the bombing,'' said Timothy Sartorius, chief executive officer
of the Central Oklahoma Chapter of the American Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Said John Clizbe, vice president of the National Red Cross, who
helped respond to the bombing: ``That event took the stigma out of
counseling.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Federal Emergency Management Agency said
Wednesday that they have expanded use of search and rescue teams,
which primarily use dogs to sniff out victims, because they were so
effective after the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Although the bombing exacted a huge toll on human lives, many
people were talking Wednesday about something powerful that endured
from that disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Keating calls it ``extreme outpourings of goodness.''
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred businesses have pledged money or support.
Reports are rampant about residents catching sight of area relief
workers in public and hastily writing checks to help the effort.
People have jammed the highways to approach churches and nonprofit
groups with donations.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous hotels, such as the Marriott Hotel Corp., are donating
temporary shelter space and free phone lines for long-distance
calls to relatives. Universities are donating dormitory rooms. The
stories go on and on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the bombing tragedy, people are grouping fast,''
said the Rev. Ronnie Harrison of the Heartland Harvest Church in
Norman.
</P>
<P>
   Keating, as he was after the bombing, has been a continuous
fixture at disaster relief scenes this week, reaching out to the
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, families at a Red Cross station held plastic bags
full of diapers and food as they crowded around the governor to
tell their stories.
</P>
<P>
   One family said their home had been replaced by a 30-foot-high
stack of debris. They said they don't know how the pile can ever be
removed. Another family recalled watching as its cars blew into the
sky.
</P>
<P>
   Keating said that insurance companies and federal aid will help
with some of the problems. He said he will organize a meeting of
area mayors to gauge progress in the rescue effort and to determine
``where to go from here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These things help bring us together. People coming together
have helped stitch this city together,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bud Parrish, missions minister with the First Baptist Church of
Moore, said Oklahoma City residents are obviously dealing with many
of the same horrors that they faced after the bombing. They will
need to express their pain in different ways, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the community can persevere by putting its trust in a
higher power, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an act of faith,'' he said. ``We let people get angry and
you take the anger and find trust in God.''

DEFUNCT BROKERAGE FIRM AND EMPLOYEES INDICTED
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Manhattan district attorney, Robert M.
Morgenthau, announced Wednesday the indictments of Duke &AMP; Co., a
defunct New York brokerage firm; its chairman, Victor Wang, and 17
former Duke employees, charging that the firm was a criminal
enterprise that conspired with other brokerage firms to manipulate
the prices of six small stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The indictments follow guilty pleas from four other former Duke
brokers that came last month. The district attorney's investigation
began in the summer of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   From January 1995 through April 1, 1998, the indictment says,
the 18 defendants conspired with two other brokerage firms in the
fraudulent sale of initial public offerings. According to
Morgenthau, Duke would allocate portions of the stock offerings to
firms including Bishop Allen &AMP; Co. and First Cambridge Securities,
which had agreed to help Duke keep the prices of the stocks
artificially high. Both firms are defunct.
</P>
<P>
   Morgenthau says Duke manipulated the stocks of Renaissance
Entertainment Corp., Sel-Leb Marketing Inc., Paravant Computer
Systems, Bristol Technology Systems Inc., IFS International Inc.
and Aviation Group Inc. Duke brokers kept the stocks at inflated
levels by making false and misleading recommendations to customers
and then deterring them from selling. When the market in the stocks
eventually plunged, the firm's customers lost money. Renaissance
Entertainment and Bristol Technology no longer trade.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment, the Duke brokers also agreed to
repurchase shares from favored customers at a later date while
requiring that nonfavored customers get pieces of the initial
public offerings on the condition that they would purchase more
shares after trading began. Both activities are illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Word that law enforcement officials were rounding up new
defendants in a securities fraud case began to spread up and down
Wall Street Wednesday morning when Thomas J. Downey, a former Duke
broker, was arrested at his office at Briarwood Investments, a
small brokerage firm in lower Manhattan. Many of Duke's customer
accounts were transferred to Briarwood after the firm closed.
</P>
<P>
   Wang surrendered to the authorities early Wednesday afternoon.
Greg Thaler, Duke's former president, was not among those indicted.
Morgenthau declined to say why Thaler was excluded.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment's 109 counts include enterprise corruption,
criminal possession of stolen property, tampering with physical
evidence, grand larceny and violations of the New York state
general business law, a state version of the nation's antitrust
law.
</P>
<P>
   It is unusual to make antitrust part of a securities fraud case
but it can be effective. The state law says that if any member of a
conspiracy admits to having colluded to set prices, no
corroboration from other accomplices is necessary.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Thirteen of those indicted Wednesday were Duke brokers. Also
indicted were Charles Bennett and Jeffrey Honigman, who supervised
Duke's sales force, and Salvatore Saporito, the firm's head trader.
All of those indicted worked in Duke's midtown Manhattan office at
909 Third Ave. The firm also had an office on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney estimates that 34,000 customers invested
more than $171 million with Duke before it went out of business in
March 1998. The brokerage firm came under scrutiny by state
securities regulators in late 1996 when officials from 20 states
began a nationwide crackdown on brokerage firms using fraudulent
methods to push obscure, over-the-counter stocks on unsuspecting
investors. Duke was the subject of 26 regulatory actions before it
went out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Wang founded Duke &AMP; Co. after working as a former broker and
executive at Stratton Oakmont, a Long Island brokerage firm that
was the subject of numerous regulatory actions before it was
expelled by the industry's own regulators in late 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Stratton's owners, Jordan R. Belfort and Daniel M. Porush, were
indicted in September on charges of securities fraud and money
laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Among those hurt by Duke's activities were a 63-year-old retired
butcher from Queens who lost almost $80,000 investing with the
firm, and a 44-year-old title examiner from Westchester who lost
more than $270,000 as a customer.

   In Moore, a police spokesman said the state's chief medical
officer had confirmed two deaths and expected to attribute four
more deaths to the tornado.
</P>
<P>
   Police said there were no reports of new casualties, nor were
there any additional survivors found. A 7:30 p.m. curfew will
remain in effect for the rest of the week.

   Some people are keeping a sense of humor in the face of the

   Like most tornado victims, D.L. Frizell and his wife, Betty,
lost a number of personal belongings such as family photo albums. A

station. The station showed the photo during the newscast and
several of Frizell's friends identified it.

   The tornado that advanced through southern Oklahoma City and
Moore cut a 40-mile swath across the middle of the state, leaving
concrete slabs where homes had been.

   At one point, the tornado reached F5 status, described as
``incredible'' on the Fujita scale, and which means its winds
topped 260 mph. It dropped back to an F4 as it continued on a
northeast track, weather service reports said.
</P>
<P>
   In the suburb of Moore, the tornado expanded to three-quarters
of a mile wide. Officials suspect that it again reached F5 status
in portions of the city, but indications are only preliminary.

   The Monday storms will go down as one of the top 10 outbreaks of
tornadoes in one day in the nation, said Kevin Kelleher, a

ECONOMIC SCENE: A WRONG MOVE ON SOCIAL SECURITY REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Big plans to overhaul Social Security may or may not be dead in
Congress this year. But regardless of what happens, Washington will
eventually have to come up with a way to keep the system from
running out of money when the baby boomers retire in the next
century.
</P>
<P>
   What each of the plans now on the table has in common, including
the bipartisan House bill proposed Wednesday, is that they all
promise financial salvation through the creation of private
accounts. These accounts would provide some of the retirement
benefits that now come entirely from a common trust fund. Private
accounts have a simple allure. Workers can expect to earn only
about a 1 or 2 percent a year above inflation on the money they pay
in payroll taxes to the trust fund. But they could expect to earn
at least 4 percent on money they put into private accounts and
invest in stocks and bonds. The difference is enough to raise
retirement benefits by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It might seem obvious, then, that private accounts are
stunningly better. Not so, economists say. Private accounts provide
no financial benefit. Indeed, they are financial losers. There is a
defense of privatization. But that defense is political.
</P>
<P>
   A careful analysis by John Geanakoplos of Yale, Olivia Mitchell
of the University of Pennsylvania and Stephen Zeldes of Columbia
University shows that private accounts accomplish nothing on
average that the trust fund couldn't accomplish more cheaply. It
should be noted that Professor Mitchell comes to this result
despite her outspoken advocacy of private accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why: Under current law, most of the money that comes into
the trust fund through payroll taxes goes right back out to support
current retirees. The obligation to pay current retirees continues
whether or not the system is privatized. If reform did nothing more
than replace a common trust fund with private accounts, there would
be little financial benefit, because there would be little to
invest in stocks, bonds or anything else. Without new money, few
dollars would ever go to the new private accounts because they
would be committed to current retirees.
</P>
<P>
   To make private accounts work, privatization advocates propose
tapping expected federal surpluses to pump extra money into the
system. They envision 150 million workers investing the extra money
in stocks and bonds yielding more than 5 percent above inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But the extra money could instead be invested in the existing
trust fund. Under current law, the money can only be used to buy
special government bonds that pay interest of only about 3 percent
above inflation. The financial advantage of private accounts over
the trust fund in the congressional plans, then, follows from a
quirk of current law, a law that could be changed to permit the
trust fund to invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks and
bonds. Invested similarly, private accounts are not better than the
trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, they are worse. A single trust fund keeps administrative
expense at a minimum. But setting up and maintaining 150 million
private accounts would rack up substantial fees and commissions for
Wall Street. Professor Peter Diamond of the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology estimates that the administrative costs would reduce
retirement payments by at least 25 percent by the time of
retirement and would cost another 5 to 10 percent to convert, as
most plans require, the savings into a monthly annuity.
</P>
<P>
   So if private accounts cost more to administer than does a trust
fund and produce no better investment returns, why bother setting
them up? The answer, proponents say, is that government cannot be
trusted to purchase shares in American companies. It would be
tempted to meddle _ for instance, by interfering with the
management of tobacco companies or selling shares of companies that
offer violent computer games to children. The way around that, say
those who favor trust fund investments, is to legislatively put
stock-picking decisions in the hands of private managers and forbid
the government to exercise voting rights.
</P>
<P>
   So the debate over private accounts rests almost entirely on a
political call. To supporters, they create private property that
Congress could never reclaim. To opponents they represent
needlessly costly and potentially pernicious reform that would
undermine the current system's transfers to low-wage workers and
scrape away the insulation a single investment pool provides
individuals against the risk that their own stock and bond
purchases go awry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a terrific economic argument for pumping more money
into Social Security in order to raise national saving and
investment,'' said Laurence S. Seidman, an economist at the
University of Delaware and author of a new book on Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a terrific economic argument for investing at least
some Social Security money in stocks because that would allow
low-wage workers to reap the benefit of high-yield stocks without
exposing themselves to much risk. But there is no purely economic
reason why either of these reforms need to be done through private
accounts.''

THE CASE AGAINST STARR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton is not the accused in the federal trial that
started this week in Alexandria, Va., but he was mentioned 37 times
in the 30-minute opening statement by the prosecutor working for
independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to a growing list of bizarre prosecutions, Starr is
seeking an obstruction-of-justice conviction of a woman
tangentially connected with an unproven allegation of an unwanted
sexual advance from Clinton in 1993. Each day's testimony has
raised more doubts about Starr's conduct than that of anyone in the
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   The central charge by former White House volunteer Kathleen
Willey _ repeated on the stand Wednesday _ is that Clinton groped
her crudely in 1993. Clinton has denied the story. Some friends of
Willey support her version; others say she was seeking an amorous
encounter with Clinton. One account says she attempted to sell her
story. Starr believes Willey but lacked the evidence to include the
incident in his impeachment referral. This did not stop him,
however, from harassing and then indicting Julie Hiatt Steele, a
former friend of Willey who at first backed her up but now says she
was lying because Willey asked her to.
</P>
<P>
   One witness is a third woman, Mary Highsmith, who claims that
her former friend Steele is now lying. But Highsmith has produced
three versions of when she first heard of the incident from Steele.
</P>
<P>
   The case is labyrinthine, to put it politely. It seems to hang
on the ability of Starr's prosecutors to show that Highsmith's
revised memory is credible, thereby proving that Steele's revised
memory is not credible.
</P>
<P>
   A more basic question is what relevance any of this has. Perhaps
the issue all along was timing. Starr indicted Steele on Jan. 7 _
the day Clinton's impeachment trial began in the Senate. The move
was derided then for its cynicism; now Starr has to make the case.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is not the accused in Alexandria, but Starr
has put himself on trial. If the jury fails to convict Steele, it
will by inference convict Starr of misconduct.

THE TOO PERSONAL COMPUTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   E-mail can be a seductive and evil genie. Summoned to serve man,
it can incriminate him, or her, as the temptation to tell all _ or
at least the juicy parts _ overwhelms caution at the keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   The genie tripped up Bill Gates, who saw a series of blunt
exchanges between his executives become what the government called
``the smoking gun'' in its antitrust case against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The genie trapped chatty presidential paramour Monica Lewinsky,
whose e-mail and that of confidante Linda Tripp and others was
confiscated by independent counsel Kenneth Starr and read all over
the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post recently reported that a husband whose
steamy e-mail is being used against him in a Virginia custody case
signed off one message with the obviously unheeded warning ``You
must not print this, and delete all files!!'' In what may explain
the compulsion to type one's most private thoughts on this most
public medium, he added: ``It's good to talk it out, but
dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, ``talk'' is often electronic, sent in
stream-of-consciousness bursts that seem to move with the speed of
a tennis match. The fingers fly, the thoughts whiz back and forth,
creating a sense of intimacy despite distances, or maybe because of
them, since the solitary person sitting at a screen may find it
easy to shed inhibitions and speak from the heart.
</P>
<P>
   People may be lulled into a false sense of security by the hum
of the machine or the friendly ``desktop'' icons _ particularly the
one labeled ``My Computer,'' or America Online's folksy country
mailbox with the flag, accompanied by the nice voice that says
``You've got mail!''
</P>
<P>
   Despite being told that the mail is about as private as a
postcard, that the boss could be monitoring it, and that gossipy
messages frequently go astray _ sometimes to the very person being
gossiped about _ we cannot resist firing off a hot one.
</P>
<P>
   So the red face joins repetitive stress injury in the
``downside'' file of this indispensible innovation. It might have
been more aptly named the impersonal computer.

 Actress Jane Alexander `deeply honored' to receive KC award  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN BURNES  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Awards are nothing new to actress Jane
Alexander, who has earned a Tony, an Emmy and four Academy Award
nominations.
</P>
<P>
   But the Harry S. Truman Public Service Award, which she will
accept Friday night in Independence, Mo., has her delighted.
</P>
<P>
   ``To receive an award for distinguished public service,'' she
said this week, ``named after one of the best presidents we have
had and that is given in his home city, I am deeply honored.''
</P>
<P>
   Ceremonies, free to the public, begin at 7 p.m. at the Truman
Library. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Truman Public Service Awards, which are given by the
city of Independence, have gone to politicians. Past recipients
include former U.S. Sens. Sam Nunn and Bill Bradley, and former
Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Until six years ago, Alexander was but an actress, known for her
presence in about 100 plays and about 40 films, including ``The
Great White Hope'' and ``All the President's Men.''
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1993 President Clinton nominated her to head the
National Endowment for the Arts, an agency that conservative House
Republicans had vowed to abolish.
</P>
<P>
   In her tenure, Alexander pared the organization's staff from 275
to 150. Grants to arts organizations also were reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Alexander won the larger battle. In October 1997, Congress
approved a $98 million budget for the agency, overcoming a previous
House vote to eliminate all funds. Alexander left soon after.
</P>
<P>
   ``I held the course,'' Alexander said. ``I kept the agency
alive. There were some hard-liners, very formidable foes...but
their voices have been quieted, and I think that's a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   She credits arts leaders in the country, as well as members of
both parties, for the agency's survival.
</P>
<P>
   Independence Mayor Ron Stewart said Alexander represented
Truman's qualities in contemporary times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love of country and a dedication to cause,'' Stewart said.
``She had both of those. And when you start going through her
background, you find her support of causes like civil rights,
causes that Mr. Truman also supported.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander is confident that Truman, a lover of classical piano
and a friend of painter Thomas Hart Benton's, would have supported
the arts agency.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Truman, however, Alexander could not have made politics
her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to love the game, the fight,'' she said. ``I didn't
love it.''  &QL;

TRUMAN GOOD NEIGHBOR AWARD TO GO TO AFRICAN-AMERICAN FOR FIRST
TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN BURNES  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A Kansas City institution that for years
didn't include many African-Americans, either in the crowd or in
the seat of honor, will have both Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Historian John Hope Franklin will become the first
African-American to receive the Harry S. Truman Good Neighbor
Award, given every year since 1973.
</P>
<P>
   And of the 478 guests expected at the noon luncheon in downtown
Kansas City, about 80 are black, said Margaret MacDonald, the award
foundation's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   That's a significant increase from the minority representation
at previous lunches, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just decided to go into the next century as an organization
that ignores nobody,'' MacDonald said.
</P>
<P>
   The luncheon is a Kansas City tradition that began in 1953 with
a small group of men. Yet as the lunch developed into a more formal
affair that brought distinguished guests from politics, journalism
and other fields, it didn't become as inclusive as some thought it
should.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, U.S. District Judge Scott O. Wright criticized the
foundation for never having honored a black person. Since 1973, 28
men and two women have received Truman Good Neighbor awards.
</P>
<P>
   Wright said he was pleased with this year's changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that is a positive commitment, and I applaud them for
that,'' said Wright, who plans to attend Friday's lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin, professor emeritus at Duke University, said he was
unaware of the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know much about what went on between then and
now with respect to the Good Neighbor Award,'' Franklin said.
</P>
<P>
   He said, however, that he was flattered to receive the award.
</P>
<P>
   The luncheon began in 1953 when 21 of Truman's friends held a
birthday celebration at a downtown restaurant. The event grew,
relocating to the nearby Muehlebach Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   To judge from surviving photographs and programs, much of the
ritual was of the affable, service club variety.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1957 lunch, as Margaret Truman was pregnant with the
former president's first grandchild, guests wore oversized infant's
bibs bearing the message ``Hi! Grandpa Truman. We hope it's
twins.''
</P>
<P>
   Truman attended the lunch every year until shortly before he
died in 1972. The group, by then called the Eddie Jacobson
Foundation in honor of Truman's former haberdashery partner, soon
adopted its current name, the Harry S. Truman Good Neighbor Award
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Of about 300 names of guests found on invitation lists from 1961
and 1964, there were no women. Henry J. Talge, the Kansas City
businessman who founded the Rival Co. and who organized the event,
preferred the company of men at the lunch, MacDonald said.
</P>
<P>
   But Talge's regard for Jeane Kirkpatrick, former U.S. ambassador
to the United Nations, was such that she became the foundation's
first woman honoree in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   When MacDonald arrived at the foundation in the mid-1980s, she
began inviting women to the lunches.
</P>
<P>
   Talge, who died in 1990, was responsible for inviting
African-Americans to the event for the first time. In 1969, current
City Council member Alvin Brooks came to his first Truman lunch at
Talge's invitation.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Brooks was one of several African-Americans to
suggest possible minority invitees to this year's lunch. At
MacDonald's request, Brooks faxed the names of about 75 black and
Hispanic men and women to the foundation office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had read what Judge Wright had said and was ready to call
Margaret when she called me,'' Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   Three times, without success, foundation members invited former
Gen. Colin Powell to receive the award. In 1994, the group gave a
special award to Call publisher Lucile H. Bluford. And the lunch
for years has featured a multicultural flavor, given the groups of
international students recognized annually.
</P>
<P>
   Wright said this week that he was curious whether the foundation
board would become more inclusive. Eighteen white men and
MacDonald, the only female member, make up the board.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Pistilli, foundation president, said that issue would be
discussed at the next board meeting.

MILOSEVIC MAY BE READYING HIS PEOPLE FOR A DEAL TO RESOLVE THE
CONFLICT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Analysts and local journalists say they
detect small signs that President Slobodan Milosevic is preparing
public opinion for an end to the war over Kosovo and for a deal
with the West.
</P>
<P>
   In Milosevic's Yugoslavia, the process by which decisions are
made is opaque and divorced from public input or debate. Political
analysts are reduced to watching and interpreting the minutiae of
state news broadcasts and official announcements _ even more so
during the wartime censorship that now prevails.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a senior Yugoslav official on Wednesday reiterated
his government's opposition to foreign troops in Kosovo as part of
a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts accustomed to watching the more subtle signs point
to the recent change in emphasis of the national television news,
which now leads each day with stories on the diplomatic efforts of
the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, who persuaded Milosevic to release three
U.S. soldiers last weekend, and the Russian envoy Victor S.
Chernomyrdin, and features correspondents' reports from Western
capitals.
</P>
<P>
   Reports on the results of NATO bombing around the country, which
used to receive the most prominent news coverage, are now relegated
to the second half of the news, 15 or 20 minutes into the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``People smell something is in the air,'' said Ognjen
Pribicevic, a senior research fellow at the Institute of Social
Sciences in Belgrade. ``I do believe there might be a break.''
</P>
<P>
   The first item on Tuesday's news was Milosevic's meeting with
two top military and police commanders in Kosovo reporting the
completion of their tasks, namely defending the country, claiming
destruction of the Kosovo Liberation Army and keeping NATO at bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Members of the army and police, at great sacrifice and loss of
life, were able to prevent the greatest aggressor in the world
occupying the country and at the same time defended our border from
bands of terrorists,'' a Belgrade daily, Blic, wrote the following
day.
</P>
<P>
   The two generals' report to the president that their task was
accomplished looked very like a final report, local journalists
suggested. ``They are definitely preparing the public for a deal,''
said one journalist, who insisted on anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many local analysts in Belgrade feel that Milosevic will
accept a solution for Kosovo which will include NATO troops this
week,'' wrote Bratislav Grubacic, editor in chief of the VIP news
service.
</P>
<P>
   Pribicevic, who recently joined up with Vuk Draskovic, the
maverick politician dismissed as deputy prime minister last week,
predicted that: ``There will be some international mission, with
Russians, Ukrainians and members from the northern European
countries. NATO is insisting it will be an armed mission. We are
saying it will not be. A compromise will be found.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Draskovic broke ranks last week, calling for an end to the
war and acceptance of an international force in Kosovo, the subject
has been openly debated in the press. Local media, heavily
controlled and cowed into silence on many topics in the first weeks
of the war by fear of government reprisals, have begun to discuss
the chances of a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition politicians, who became quiet amid the intense
patriotism the NATO air strikes evoked, have begun to voice
opinions on the possibility of foreign troops arriving in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Vuk Obradovic, leader of the small political party Social
Democracy, said in an interview that ``if that is the condition for
us to go back on to the road to peace and stop the killing and
destruction of the country, then let them come in.''
</P>
<P>
   A well-known former general, Obradovic said the Yugoslav
military and Serb police could find an understanding with a foreign
force. Yet after the NATO attacks, he said, ``We think it is in the
common interest of all, NATO as well, to put the whole thing in
U.N. hands and those forces should be under the U.N. flag.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He and other politicians also say that it is important that the
international force have a clear mandate, a limited time frame for
their mission in Kosovo and be restricted to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Other politicians voiced similar views. Vojislav Kostunica,
leader of the Democratic Party of Serbia, was quoted in Blic as
saying that Milosevic was pondering the way in which the
peacekeepers could be armed. Last week, Milosevic said in an
interview with a Western journalist that foreign soldiers could
bear arms for self-defense only.
</P>
<P>
   NATO troops should not be in the forefront of the force,
Kostunica suggested, but added: ``There is little likelihood of it
being only a civilian force.''
</P>
<P>
   Goran Svilanovic, the new leader of the opposition group Civic
Alliance of Serbia, was quoted by Blic: ``It is in the interests of
Serbia, not the U.S.A., to stop the war, because our citizens are
getting killed and our towns are being destroyed. That is why we
have to do more than others to stop the war.''
</P>
<P>
   While none of these politicians has any influence with the
leadership, and all admit that Milosevic will keep them guessing
whether he will make a deal until the last moment, they all seem to
sense a change in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Grubacic, editor of the VIP news service, suggested Milosevic
needed two more weeks to prepare the Yugoslav people and military.
``He needs to tire the people a bit more, so they are ready to
accept anything,'' he said. ``So the question now is how he sneaks
out of the problem.''

<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY _ They survived that wicked brute of a tornado and
finally got to go home Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But many found no home, just bits and pieces of brick, wood and
insulation, crumpled automobiles and everything they owned gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming back and seeing it all destroyed is kind of hard,''
said Chris Pillifant, who rode out Monday's tornado huddling in a
shower stall with his wife and 3-year-old golden retriever. ``This
just looks like 'Nam,'' he said referring to the war in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The casualty list resembled a war's toll: at least 38 dead,
hundreds injured, thousands homeless, dozens missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have over 100 missing persons reports ... at the present
time,'' said Ray Blakeney, director of operations for the state
medical examiner's office. He issued a public plea for help in
finding the missing.
</P>
<P>
   Although early damage estimates hovered around $225 million,
officials Wednesday called that figure low _ ``like really low,''
said Rick Buchanan, press spokesman for Gov. Frank Keating. The
latest estimates put loss at upwards of $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wouldn't surprise me a bit,'' Brad Craine, a spokesman
for the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the death count remained at 38, although
authorities said a man identified as John Green, believed to be
from Moore, died shortly before noon Wednesday. His name had not
been added to the official fatality list by nightfall.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, scores of people remained in area hospitals, many
suffering serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
   A 39-day-old baby clung to life at one hospital, his skull
shattered by flying debris; a 13-year-old girl was in serious
condition at another hospital with a broken neck; and a 33-year-old
woman was being treated for injuries suffered when a board or fence
post entered one side of her face and exited the other.
</P>
<P>
   Between 2,000 and 3,000 homes were destroyed or heavily damaged
in the Oklahoma City area, said David Van Nostrand, director of
Emergency Management Services for Oklahoma County.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of homes remain without electricity or gas, and 70
utility crews from Texas were expected to arrive in Oklahoma on
Thursday to help restore power.
</P>
<P>
   Residents allowed back into their neighborhoods for the first
time since Monday said they were among the lucky _ they had somehow
survived tornadoes packing winds approaching 260 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said our Hail Marys and kept yelling,'' said Pillifant, who
was buried in the rubble of the 2,000-square-foot house that
collapsed around him, his wife and dog.
</P>
<P>
   Cars by the hundreds lined up bumper to bumper at police
checkpoints where people had to show identification and proof they
lived in a certain neighborhood before they could enter.
</P>
<P>
   When John and Sheryl Molsbee drove onto their street, they found
their brick-and-frame home standing, but minus its roof. Still on
the stove was Monday's macaroni dinner in a pot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's worse than I thought,'' said John Molsbee, who wasn't
home when the giant twisters leveled neighborhoods in Oklahoma City
and surrounding communities.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the city, residents searched for irreplaceable
possessions: photographs, keepsakes and mementos collected before
the tornadoes shattered their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Some scoured their shredded and ravaged apartments and found
undamaged CDs, home videos and high school and college diplomas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It cost me $30,000,'' said Aaron Penix, 22, referring to his
sheepskin. ``I'm actually really surprised. It was merciful.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Chong Wren sat at an apartment complex with her back to
a fallen tree, its bark stripped away by tornadic winds. She had
survived by hiding in one of her unit's two bathrooms. The one she
chose remained untouched; the other disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had stayed there, I would have died,'' Wren said. ``I
don't know why I picked that one. It was Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   At Westmoore High School, the parking lot was littered with
scores of damaged vehicles, many of them turned upside down. Wood
from nearby houses speared the windshields of some. A dead horse
lay against the front bumper of a green pickup.
</P>
<P>
   Next door to the Pillifants, members of the Westmoore football
team helped their coach, Chris Stiles, sort through the rubble of
his family's home. They found eight albums with photos of Stiles'
two children.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I'm looking for,'' said Stiles, 36.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is the kids don't have a scratch. By the grace
of God, we're here and we'll rebuild better than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents face the task of rebuilding from what the
National Weather Service officially upgraded from F4 to F5 the
tornadoes that tore through Oklahoma City and Moore. An F5 tornado
is the most severe with winds exceeding 260 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Weather Service engineering teams tracing the tornadoes' paths
said one was 3/4 mile wide as it sliced a 40-mile swath rumbling
through Moore and Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   In one Oklahoma City neighborhood, police found part of an
airplane wing thought to have come from Chickasha about 30 miles
southeast.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal officials, meanwhile, were making arrangements
to find housing for the displaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking tent cities,'' said Ben Frizzell of the
state Office of Civil Emergency Management. ``There is a disaster
housing program through FEMA that will provide rental assistance
for up to 18 months if needed. Some people may even use this to
rent travel trailers to put on their property.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Red Cross also passed out vouchers for people to
temporarily stay in motels.

NYC SCHOOL BOARD BACKS MAYOR TO REJECT CHANCELLOR'S 5-YEAR PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The battle between Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Schools
Chancellor Rudy Crew moved to a new front Wednesday, as a
four-member majority of the Board of Education backed by the mayor
rejected the chancellor's five-year school construction proposal
and agreed on its own version.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement _ by the two appointees of the mayor and the
appointees of the Queens and Staten Island borough presidents _ set
the stage for the first defeat by Crew by the board since it hired
him as chief executive in October 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The substitute plan was devised in recent days at City Hall at
the insistence of Queens officials, who felt shortchanged by the
chancellor's proposal. But the new majority could not have been
forged without the support of the mayor's two appointees, an
indication of the mayor's sway over the board and city education
policy.
</P>
<P>
   In coming together, the majority brought the feud between
Giuliani and Crew out of the theoretical realm, over such questions
as whether there should be taxpayer-financed vouchers or an
education commissioner who reports to the mayor, and into the
practical.
</P>
<P>
   The board had already scheduled a vote on the chancellor's
proposal for noon on Thursday, and that vote is still expected to
take place. The four members said in a written statement Wednesday
that they would vote no and then approve an outline of their plan,
ordering the chancellor and his aides to write a proposal that
meets their specifications by ``the close of business Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   Though stopping short of a formal vote of no confidence in Crew,
the board majority made clear that it could curtail the
chancellor's power in a crucial area: setting the construction
priorities for a system of 1.1 million students and 1,100 schools.
</P>
<P>
   The four who wrote the alternative proposal did so with all the
secrecy of a palace coup, conferring without involving the members
from the Bronx and Manhattan, as well as the Brooklyn member, board
president William Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   Under the revised plan, the overall number of new classroom
seats would be reduced, as a result of a more conservative estimate
of financing, as would money for repairs and high school computers.
But the share of new seats for Queens and Staten Island would rise,
at the expense of the other three boroughs.
</P>
<P>
   The four-member majority announced its plans, in a signed formal
board resolution released late Wednesday morning, at a time the
chancellor was in Washington state, tending to a son recovering
from an emergency appendectomy.
</P>
<P>
   His aides said he was flying back late on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Though the board's headquarters at 110 Livingston St. in
Brooklyn was rife with whispered questions about how Crew could
remain as chancellor if he lost such a crucial vote, his aides said
emphatically that he had no intention of leaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wherever the board goes, so goes the chancellor,'' said Chiara
Coletti, the chancellor's spokeswoman. ``The chancellor thinks that
the capital plan he presented is a far better one for the children.
However, the mayor got the votes for the plan he wants. The
chancellor reports to the board and will follow the will of the
board.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't believe it's a divided board,'' she added. ``The
board divided on this one issue. The mayor worked hard to get those
votes.''
</P>
<P>
   The chancellor's latest capital proposal, released last weekend,
called for $11.2 billion to be spent on school construction from
this July through 2004, though his aides felt assured of only $8.1
billion of that money, which is drawn from federal and state as
well as city sources. The substitute plan would reduce the
chancellor's plan further still, to $7 billion, because, the
members in the majority argued, Crew's plan was based on overly
optimistic projections of financing from the state and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But though the total number of classroom seats would go down,
the substitute proposal would substantially reconfigure how those
seats were distributed.
</P>
<P>
   Queens, whose officials had complained the loudest about
inequities in the initial plan, would increase its share of all new
school construction to 65.4 percent from 61.9 percent, and Staten
Island's would rise to 4 percent from 1.6 percent. The share of new
construction in Brooklyn would fall to 12.3 percent from 16
percent, in the Bronx to 13.2 percent from 14.8 percent, and in
Manhattan to 5.1 percent from 5.7 percent.

FHS REPORTS 7% INCREASE IN EARNINGS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Managed care specialist Foundation Health Systems
Inc. reported a 7 percent gain in first quarter earnings Wednesday
thanks in part to the sale of some money-losing operations.
</P>
<P>
   The health insurer said profits rose to $46.3 million, or 23
cents a diluted share, on revenues of $2.28 billion, compared to
$43.3 million, or 22 cents, one year ago. The results, which
exclude several one-time gains and charges, met a consensus
estimate of 22 cents per share from analysts surveyed by First Call
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Helping the company's net income was a $53.5 million pretax gain
from the sale of Foundation's pharmacy benefit operations to
Advance Paradigm Inc. in March. Foundation took a restructuring
charge of $21 million from the pending closure of its service
center in Pueblo, Colo., and was hit by a $5.4 million charge from
new U.S. accounting rules.
</P>
<P>
   The Woodland Hills, Calif., company previously sold its
money-losing workers compensation unit, further easing the drain on
corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   Though year-on-year there wasn't much of a gain, Wednesday's
results are a clear improvement over Foundation's recent
performance. The company lost $104 million in the last quarter of
1998, for an annual loss of $164 million. Much of that stemmed from
the poor performance of the company's Medicare contracts in the
northeast United States. In several counties, Foundation
subsidiaries spent more providing care to elderly members than they
were paid by the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a turnaround in the Northeast, a lot of other
issues become secondary or tertiary,'' said analyst Robert Hoehn at
ING Baring Furman Selzs in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some analysts noted that while encouraging, Foundation's
results do not guarantee the firm is past its financial woes. The
first quarter is typically the most profitable among health
insurers and medical costs often rise as the year progresses.
</P>
<P>
   Investors sent Foundation shares down 31.25 cents, or 2.05
percent, to $14.9375. The company had closed at a 1999 high of
$15.25 on Tuesday.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The day after the Dow Jones industrial average hit
10,000 this spring, a special report explaining the record-breaking
news appeared on the Wall Street Journal's Web site: The headline
was a panel of bold, 3-D letters layered one upon another, and a
dollar-green bull leapt off the screen.
</P>
<P>
   The image bore a striking resemblance to the script that once
covered the city's public transportation system. And that was no
coincidence. The man The Journal had tapped to design its site _
Kel First Rodriguez _ was once a graffiti writer, slipping out of
his South Bronx home under cover of night to emblazon his moniker
on New York City subway cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of that graffiti feeling, that energy, sort of crept in
there,'' Rodriguez, now 35, said of his work for The Journal,
adding this caveat: ``I knew how far to go in that direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Kel First's rise from the underground, so to speak, mirrors the
radical transformation of graffiti in the 20 years since its peak.
Once reviled by some as a visual scourge of the city, graffiti
today _ or at least the astonishing esthetic it invented _ is
everywhere. Only now, it is paid for.
</P>
<P>
   Its influence is indelible: It can be seen on billboards
plugging $100 sneakers and in advertisements for soda. And, even as
city subways are touted as graffiti-free, ads promoting everything
from radio stations to the Metrocard now cover some buses top to
bottom, just as graffiti did back in the days when taggers dangled
from the tops of subway cars, risking fines and jail time to turn
the trains into their personal moving billboards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Graffiti was able to come along on the coattails of hip-hop
and people are appreciating it for its style, which they couldn't
back then, because they couldn't get beyond the vandalism thing,''
said Martha Cooper, a photographer who, with Henry Chalfant, wrote
the authoritative history of the movement, ``Subway Art'' in 1984.
``It's been altered and embraced by the corporate world.''
</P>
<P>
   The graffiti trio TATS Cru has covered entire walls with ads for
Coca-Cola, for instance, while Lady Pink, one of the rare women to
paint trains in the late 1970s, now paints murals on commission.
Cey Adams designs album covers and Futura and Stash produce a
graffiti-inspired clothing line.
</P>
<P>
   Full-time artists like Lee Quinones and Blade, contemporaries of
graffiti-inspired artists like Keith Haring, whose work brought him
fame and fortune nearly two decades ago, now sell their canvasses
on the other side of the Atlantic, where graffiti and other
accouterments of hip-hop culture are enjoying an exploding market.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, young Europeans make the journey here _ some to paint a
bona fide New York subway car _ though today it is less for the
sake of seeing their work on a running train than it is for a
snapshot to take home. A few writers still toss up a piece on a
blank wall, as others throw them up in cyberspace; several sites,
including Blade's, (bladekingofgraf.com) are devoted entirely to
graffiti.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, something commemorates the world that was. The
most recent event was a show at Exhibit A Gallery in Harlem
memorializing one of the old kings of the genre: Dondi, who died
last fall at 38. The show was organized by James T.O.P., a fellow
graffiti writer, as a tribute to his childhood friend. On the
walls, he hung a couple of Dondi's own works as well as photos of
the old painted subway cars.
</P>
<P>
   Lance and Vance Paul wandered into that gallery on 147th Street
one Saturday afternoon recently, and it was like wandering into
their childhood, they said. The 36-year-old twins, who grew up in
Harlem watching trains, peered closely at the photos, reminiscing
aloud. They rattled off the names of their favorite writers. They
debated whether Zephyr did the No.1 train or the No. 3. (Zephyr, in
fact, covered the No. 1 out of Riverdale while it rested in a yard
near his private school.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Long time,'' mused Lance Paul, shaking his head at the memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were the big years for graffiti,'' added Vance.
</P>
<P>
   Those big years were chronicled in the 1982 cult movie ``Wild
Style.'' In the film, made just as graffiti was being embraced by
the art world, Quinones, then a rising star in the city's graffiti
movement, summed up its audacious, rebellious spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a graffiti writer is about taking the chances,'' he
said. ``You got to go out and paint and be called an outlaw at the
same time.''
</P>
<P>
   At 38, Quinones is no longer called an outlaw. In fact, just the
other day he was calling from Paris, where he was hanging his
canvasses at a gallery in the Bastille district and painting two
pieces commissioned by a deejay.
</P>
<P>
   Although many New Yorkers regarded graffiti as one of the most
conspicuous signs of urban decay, to its perpetrators it was both
game and vocation _ and, most of all, an expression of identity.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly, in the early 1980s, the Manhattan art world embraced
the movement. Uptown suddenly met downtown. Agents picked up
taggers, and their words appeared on SoHo walls.
</P>
<P>
   It was mostly a short-lived affair. These days, with the
exception of venues like the Martinez Gallery in Chelsea, which is
devoted to the genre, graffiti finds a home mostly in European
galleries and museums.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to support an artist as he develops,'' Quinones said
of his patrons in Europe, where a modest-sized canvas of his now
fetches up to $10,000.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   His resume today includes exhibitions from Nagoya, Japan, to
Barcelona, Spain, to the Whitney Museum of American Art in New
York, where his work was shown in the '80s. ``What I'm doing on
canvas, I used to do on trains,'' he said. ``I want people to study
my work and not just be astonished when a train comes out of a
tunnel.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, veteran graffiti writers like Quinones, Lady Pink and
Blade are invited to demonstrate their skills at annual graffiti
jams from Milan to Stockholm. Outlaws who once took great pains to
conceal their identities are now asked to paint before crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Back when half the skill lay in eluding the authorities, Lady
Pink was muscling her way into the boys' club that was graffiti. By
age 15, she was crawling out the windows of her parents' home in
Astoria, proving that she, too, could perch on the edge of a train,
paint for hours straight and sprint at the sight of cops.
</P>
<P>
   At first, when her parents discovered what she was doing, they
were appalled. But they came around when she sold her first canvas
in 1981 _ for what seemed then like a whopping $500. ``My dad built
shelves for all that spray paint I had stolen,'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with her husband, a fellow graffiti writer who calls
himself Smith, she runs a painting company that has put fantastical
scenes in murals inside posh restaurants on Long Island. Even the
old neighborhood school in Astoria, which she tagged mercilessly as
a teen-ager, employed her to do a mural.
</P>
<P>
   While some former graffiti writers have become full-time
artists, others have bypassed the art world for greener pastures.
</P>
<P>
   Cey Adams hooked up with the rapper Russell Simmons in the
mid-1980s, just as the gallery scene began losing interest in
graffiti and hip-hop was becoming more commercially viable.
</P>
<P>
   At 37, Adams is the creative director of Simmons' Def Jam label.
His work can be seen on billboards advertising radio station Hot
97, WQHT (97.1), whose fat, bold logo he designed, and on the album
covers of countless rappers, from L.L. Cool J. to E.p.m.D.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, he said, few teen-agers today seem to have the same
urge to grab a marker and tag the subways _ and those who do do not
impress him. ``If you tag on the back of my seat and I got on a
$1,000 jacket,'' he said, ``I'm not going to be smiling.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, some young people _ and some not so young _ still burn
with the desire to ``bomb'' a train or a wall. Now the windows of
subways are scratched with monikers, and every now and then,
someone paints an elaborate piece on a building. Although graffiti
is still very much illegal, punishable by fines and criminal
prosecution, the train tunnels still lure the occasional writer.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 25 years ago, Futura got caught in one of those tunnels
when a fire caught him and a friend unawares while they were
painting a train. The friend suffered massive burns and spoke out
passionately against graffiti.
</P>
<P>
   Shaken, Futura joined the Navy. But when he returned home, art
summoned him back. He began painting walls legally and flirted
briefly with the art world. By 1990, he and a fellow writer, Stash,
had begun churning out T-shirts splashed with brand name logos.
</P>
<P>
   Today they produce several lines of ``urban wear,'' including
one made for Japan. At their Eldridge Street boutique, a sweat
shirt sells for up to $70.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a story of survival,'' said Futura, who is also known as
Leonard McGurr, 43 and the father of two children, 14 and 8.
``There's a way to profit from the work without defacing public
property.''
</P>
<P>
   Kel First figured that out as well. He gave up his post at The
Wall Street Journal last month and is devoting himself to his own
Web site, where he is building an online shopping mall for urban
gear: labodega.com. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: CAMPAIGN FOR PHIL JACKSON IN FULL SWING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ When Phil Jackson was a player with the New York
Knicks in the early 1970s, he would hear coach Red Holzman and
trainer Danny Whelan inform starting small forward Bill Bradley
that when Bradley became president of the United States, they
wanted the jobs of checking the height of the water levels of the
Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Holzman would sit at one coast for six
months and Whelan at the other, and then they would switch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't approached Bill for that job yet,'' Jackson said
Wednesday, ``although he tells people that if elected I'd be his
secretary of dee-fense. Which is different from secretary of
de-fense.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who has been unemployed since last June, has been an
unpaid campaigner for Bradley, who, some 25 years after the end of
his playing career, has announced that he is seeking residence in
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Jackson, at age 53 and looking fit and rested
and shorn of his gray beard, was honored at halftime of the
Bulls-Orlando Magic game at the United Center for his masterful
contributions as coach of Bulls teams that won six National
Basketball Association championships in the previous eight seasons.
Among those in attendance was former Sen. Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   For a combination of reasons _ the retirement of Michael Jordan
to a personality conflict with general manager Jerry Krause, to a
need to simply clear his basketball sinuses _ Jackson quit the
Bulls and took a sabbatical.
</P>
<P>
   In that time he has built a house in Woodstock, N.Y., and has
been giving speeches to the tune of $45,000 a talk (outside of
politicking), doing some writing. He is, after all, the author of
the best seller ``Sacred Hoops.'' And he is still ``looking over my
shoulder at the world of basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   A little more than that surely. While Wednesday night was the
first time this season that he has entered an NBA arena, Jackson
said he has checked out some games on television. But he has also
been Penelope to NBA suitors. He has sat and woven his thoughts
quietly while his representative, the Chicago lawyer Todd
Musburger, has been fielding love notes from teams desirous of
Jackson's hand as coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have four offers on the table,'' Musburger said, ``and at
the end of the season we're expecting at least two or three more.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said, ``I'd be interested only if the intrigue is
there.'' And while Jackson has sometimes spoken in cryptic terms,
it was clear what ``intrigue'' meant: money, team, control, city,
and not necessarily in that order.
</P>
<P>
   The teams that conceivably have been in touch with Musburger are
the Lakers, the Nets and maybe Washington, Denver, Charlotte and
Vancouver _ and the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   One thing Jackson said he would have to look at is the contracts
of current players and where the team is in the salary cap and how
flexible they would be in dumping aging veterans and getting
players who appeal to him. Which conceivably would eliminate the
Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``And everyone would like to go to a warm-weather city,''
Jackson said, ``but that's not a determining factor.'' That might
have significance for Los Angeles or Charlotte, where Jordan may
become a part owner. But Jackson says Paul Silas has done a good
job as coach of the Hornets and he would imagine that Jordan would
be very hands-on as an owner.
</P>
<P>
   Which would not be too attractive for Jackson, who would like
the kind of control over decisions on players that Pat Riley and
Rick Pitino have with Miami and Boston. ``I want to decide the
players for my coaching style.''
</P>
<P>
   One such player is Shaquille O'Neal, who traveled to South
America with Jackson three years ago to conduct basketball clinics.
Jackson, Musburger said, liked O'Neal and believes he would be
great for the triangle offense that Jackson employed with the
Bulls. Then there is the cash. Jackson made $6 million in his last
year as the Bulls' coach. He would want more. Chuck Daly is
currently the highest-paid pure coach at $5 million. Riley and
Pitino have upper-management deals in which they earn $10 million
or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you know Phil,'' said Musburger, alluding to Jackson's
flower-child early years and his Zen-blend later days, ``you know
that it's not just money that motivates him.''
</P>
<P>
   One other factor: how Bradley is progressing as the one, as
Jackson said, ``to lead us into the new millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   If someone who doesn't know Jackson asks what he does for a
living, what does he say? ``I say I'm a magician,'' he said with a
smile.
</P>
<P>
   A magician now, he was asked, or then? ``Both,'' he said,
inscrutably. &QL;

HEINZ AIMS FOR MORE GOLD OUT OF ITS RED CONDIMENT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the chief executive of H.J. Heinz spoke before a group of
Wall Street analysts in Florida in February, promoting his
company's fresh take on its business, the souvenir handed out to
everyone to remind them of the big changes at Heinz was . . . a
bottle of ketchup.
</P>
<P>
   Using its flagship condiment as a battering ram, Heinz is in the
middle of a major campaign to revamp itself as a zippy, modern
corporate behemoth, not the slow, barely growing behemoth it has
long been. For the first time in five years, Heinz is spending
large sums _ an estimated $50 million _ on an advertising campaign.
The campaign, designed by the Leo Burnett Co., centers on ketchup
and is intended to put forth a more contemporary image for the
whole company. The new ads portray ketchup as a way to make your
food ``taste however you want it to taste,'' among other things.
But the question remains: What kind of future is there in ketchup?
</P>
<P>
   At the company's headquarters in Pittsburgh, people are wildly
enthusiastic about the red stuff. Last fall, the test kitchens came
up with recipes for a ketchup vinaigrette and for peanut butter
cookies, slightly darker than usual, made from dough with a
quarter-cup of ketchup in it.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the supposed role of ketchup in human psychology,
a theory that probably gets more attention at Heinz than it does in
any formal academic quarters. ``We're letting people, particularly
kids, personalize their food,'' said Kenneth C. Keller Jr., the
marketing manager for ketchup.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is the chief executive's view on the subject.
``Ketchup is the barometer for how Heinz does,'' said William R.
Johnson, who made his name in pet food at the company but has
clearly shifted his allegiance. After several years of inertia,
worldwide ketchup sales rose 8 percent in the last fiscal year,
which ended in April.
</P>
<P>
   Whether ketchup can truly be turned around will be a serious
test for Johnson, who took over the company's top job last year
from the colorful, debonair Anthony J.F. O'Reilly. While the latter
remains chairman of Heinz and is the ninth-largest stockholder,
with 6.2 million shares, Johnson has made it plain, without naming
names, that he inherited several problems across the company's
divisions, which include canned tuna, pickles, baby food and Weight
Watchers products and classes. In February, he announced the latest
Heinz reorganization, in which products are grouped globally to
capitalize on what is working well, and said he would sell the
Weight Watchers classroom business.
</P>
<P>
   He and other Heinz executives are expected to paint a bright
picture of the company's future, particularly as it pertains to
ketchup, at a food-industry conference organized by Goldman, Sachs
&AMP; Co. Thursday. But with the stock near its 52-week low, analysts
are taking a wait-and-see position as to whether Heinz's strategy _
which includes cutting some prices, distributing recipes in the
manner of condensed-soup companies during the 1950s and trying to
spin the image of ketchup to appeal to a wider audience _ will pay
off. After all, this is the twilight of the 20th century, during
which Americans became acquainted with cosmopolitan alternatives
like salsa, Dijon mustard and tamarind glaze.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem in my industry is that there is a battle for the
stomach,'' said Nomi Ghez, a food analyst for Goldman, Sachs. ``And
all of the companies are saying they are going to get per-capita
consumption up. Well, the stomach is a limited space. They are not
going to be able to increase per-capita consumption of all their
products.''
</P>
<P>
   Ketchup is seen mainly as an accompaniment to something else,
such as hot dogs and french fries. But Keller is sure it can be
more.
</P>
<P>
   For example, recipes that use a lot of ketchup should drive
sales, he said. ``The bottom line is, if we can get people to use
these recipes, they are going to use between 4 and 10 ounces of
ketchup at a shot, versus a typical serving of 1 to 2 ounces,'' he
said. ``That's gold for us, and gold for the category.''
</P>
<P>
   Heinz had been a little arrogant about its brand strength,
managers acknowledge. The price had risen to about 65 percent more
than store-brand ketchup but has been rolled back to 40 percent
more. Changes in the way tomatoes are processed for ketchup helped
bring about savings worldwide that are covering the price drop,
said Joseph Jimenez, the president and chief executive of Heinz
North America.
</P>
<P>
   The company also stopped advertising ketchup, again thinking it
had momentum to spare. Market share fell steadily, although Heinz
kept its spot as the leading brand. A brief campaign last year, on
the theme of 25 tomatoes in every bottle, failed to connect with
most consumers. ``What happened was, the mentality was not as
focused on marketing and growing the top line as it is now,''
Jimenez, a recent hire from Conagra Inc., said.
</P>
<P>
   But in October, it selected Burnett to handle the worldwide
brand duties for Heinz ketchup and other condiments.
</P>
<P>
   The new campaign, which includes print and television ads, is
intended to graft a personality onto ketchup that will appeal to
teen-agers and young adults _ the people who have grown up without
associating ketchup with a Carly Simon song or a cowboy theme. The
TV ads feature a voice-over seemingly narrated by a teen-ager (the
voice actually belongs to a member of the Burnett team) and an
ironic take on the condiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the Heinz tomato ketchup never comes out,'' the voice
intones, while the camera zeroes in on an almost-empty bottle. ``It
just stays stuck in there and we can only look at it. This part of
the ketchup will never be completely understood. This part of the
ketchup has issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Another spot refers to Heinz as ``the rude ketchup'' because it
keeps people waiting. Another discusses how Heinz ketchup ``allows
you to make food taste however you want it to taste,'' and goes on,
``Two popular options are ketchuppy, and even more ketchuppy.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads are being broadcast in Canada, Albany and Kansas City,
Mo., and may be expanded to the rest of the country, Keller said.
``We're not going national with this until we measure the impact of
this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is for the ads to be shown worldwide as well, where
Heinz hopes to get everyone to spend at least half as much on
ketchup as Americans do, which is now about $2 a person each year.
Sales in Thailand are almost at the goal, and Heinz recently
completed a deal with ABC Foods in Indonesia that Jimenez predicted
would bolster its sales in Asia. ``It gives us a springboard to
launch into the region in a very big way,'' he said. ``Ketchup is a
pretty universal taste.'' &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: IT HAS NOT BEEN EASY BEING A KNICKS FAN
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Is this the Knicks' year?
</P>
<P>
   Nola Whiteman considered the question for a split second then
laughed. ``The year that they're going to win?'' she asked. ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't a mean-spirited no or a condescending no. This was
the incredulous no of a veteran Knicks fan who has cared so much,
for so long, that she refuses to let on that she cares.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know everybody says this is a new season, but it can't be a
new season,'' she said. ``Your history and your experience play a
part in whatever you are on a given day. The Knicks' history and
experience do not lead me to believe with any degree of faith that
we're going to be champions this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Nola Whiteman, 60, is not just any spectator. She is the
quintessential Knicks fan: cynical, brutally frank, yet loyal and
forgiving to a fault. Her loyalty has been tested over the years by
a succession of coaches in the post-Red Holzman era: Willis Reed,
Hubie Brown, Bob Hill, Rick Pitino, Stu Jackson, John MacLeod, Pat
Riley, Don Nelson and now Jeff Van Gundy.
</P>
<P>
   Whiteman and her husband, Herbert, watched the Knicks during
their dark seasons _ 1984-87, when they failed to reach the
playoffs. The couple suffered through four more seasons when the
team did not get past the second round. Then there was the 1993-94
season, when the Knicks lost to Houston in the NBA finals, 4 games
to 3. Since then, the Knicks have gone no further than the second
round.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Knicks never make it easy, and they've been like that for
a long time,'' Nola Whiteman said Wednesday afternoon. ``In the
Holzman days you had a greater sense of comfort _ you knew you had
a winning team. Riley almost brought that back, but I don't think
he ever quite accomplished that.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, Herb, a graduate of Columbia's school of engineering,
came home and announced that the family had their first Knicks
season tickets. The team was coming off its first NBA championship.
Patrick Ewing and Jeff Van Gundy were 8 years old. The Whiteman's
daughter, Cheryl, was 7. ``Cheryl used to go down and talk to John
Condon, the longtime Knicks announcer, and speak to the players,''
Whiteman said. ``Walt Frazier was her hero.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next 27 seasons, the Knicks became part of the Whiteman
family tradition: On most Tuesdays and Saturdays, the three would
go to the Garden and cheer for their Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970-71, they sat in the green seats and watched the Knicks
as they were eliminated by the Baltimore Bullets in the Eastern
Conference finals. The Knicks reached the NBA finals the next
season, but lost to the Lakers, 4 games to 1. The next season was
the last great season: the Knicks defeated Los Angeles, 4 games to
1.
</P>
<P>
   Whiteman tracks the ebb and flow of the family by their
progression of season tickets. Seven years after he bought the
first set, Herb Whiteman became a vice president of the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York _ the first black vice president at the
Fed.
</P>
<P>
   As the family became more prosperous, they moved closer to the
floor. When Cheryl went off to MIT, they moved behind the basket,
to the red seats _ now purple _ and downsized to two seats.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's season finale against Miami marked the end of
a triumphant return season for Nola Whiteman. Her husband died in
October 1997 at age 61 after a long, heart-related illness. She
often didn't go to the Garden after he died, though when she did
go, the miniature families that sections of fans can become served
as a support network.
</P>
<P>
   Two season-ticket holders made contributions to one of
Whiteman's favorite charities. By coincidence, a mural-sized photo
of her husband cheering with other fans is on the wall of a
corridor in the Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basketball games have been a source of comfort,'' she
said. ``What the Knicks did for us as a family was give us a common
interest; something you could talk about as a family, something you
could participate in as a family.''
</P>
<P>
   Now she comes to the games with an assortment of close friends.
Her daughter has her own pair of season tickets, and brings her
5-year old daughter to the games. She reacts to the players, the
crowd and the drama like her mother had nearly 30 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   All that is missing are the championships. On Monday, Nola
Whiteman sat and watched the Knicks struggle into the playoffs with
a Ewing-inspired victory over Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Is this the year the Knicks make a championship run? Whiteman
softens her stance ever so slightly and allows for the possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I think they can manage Miami,'' she said. ``I don't get
as excited as I used to. I wait until the game is over. At one
point there was a greater level of comfort with the Knicks. Now
you're in turmoil with them.'' &QL;

BRUTALITY TRIAL TOLD OF OFFICER'S CONDUCT 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Prosecution witnesses at the trial of four police
officers charged with brutalizing a Haitian immigrant testified
Wednesday that one of the officers had been acting aggressively
during a melee outside a Brooklyn nightclub shortly before the
alleged attack occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony in federal court in Brooklyn appeared intended to
portray the officer, Justin A. Volpe, as a provocative, strutting
figure shortly before prosecutors say that the immigrant, Abner
Louima, was beaten in a police car near the nightclub and then
tortured in a restroom of the 70th Precinct station house in
Flatbush.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say that Volpe and the three other officers on trial
beat Louima in the car because they mistakenly believed he had
punched Volpe during the melee. The prosecution has also charged
that Volpe and one of the other three officers later tortured
Louima in the restroom by shoving part of a broken broomstick into
his rectum and then into his mouth, severely injuring him.
</P>
<P>
   Other prosecution witnesses testified that when they saw Louima
in the nightclub in the hours before he was arrested, he did not
appear to be injured or in pain and he did not complain of any
injuries or pain. Those witnesses appeared to be intended to
counter the suggestion by Volpe's lawyer in his opening statement
on Tuesday that Louima had received his internal juries not from an
assault by police officers, but in an act of consensual sex with
another man before he had come into contact with the police.
</P>
<P>
   Louima, the subject of one of the most explosive and racially
sensitive cases of purported police brutality in New York City in
recent years _ he is black and the accused officers are white _ is
expected to testify Thursday, although legal wrangling could delay
his appearance on the stand. On Wednesday, one of his lawyers
served papers on the lawyers representing the police officers,
seeking to circumscribe their questioning of Louima.
</P>
<P>
   The papers were served under seal, making them confidential, and
neither the lawyers for the officers nor Louima's lawyer, Sanford
A. Rubenstein, would discuss them. For the restrictions to be
enforced, the judge at the trial, Eugene H. Nickerson, would have
to rule that Louima enjoys a legal privilege that permits
questioning of him to be restricted as requested.
</P>
<P>
   The officers' lawyers have indicated interest in questioning
Louima about what they claim is his lawyers' involvement in
preparing him for his testimony, and it is possible that his
lawyers are seeking to preclude questions on that topic on the
ground of lawyer-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Louima, 32, was working as a security guard at a sewage
treatment plant at the time of his arrest in the street brawl in
August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The four officers are all charged with violating his civil
rights by beating him in the police car after his arrest. In
addition to Volpe, they are Officers Charles Schwarz, Thomas Bruder
and Thomas Wiese.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Volpe is charged with using the stick on Louima in
the station house restroom and Schwarz is charged with holding him
down. A sergeant, Michael Bellomo, is charged with trying to cover
up the alleged beating in the police car.
</P>
<P>
   All five deny the charges.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Wednesday's testimony, one of the witnesses, Ian Russell, who
in 1997 was a member of Phantoms, a Haitian band that was playing
at the nightclub near where the melee took place, said he saw Volpe
push a man to the ground from behind as a large group of club
patrons were on the sidewalk outside.
</P>
<P>
   Russell said that one man ``seemed to be gesticulating to the
officers'' but ``didn't seem to be making any sort of threatening
gestures.'' Russell said Volpe then shoved the man to the ground,
``puffed out his chest, brushed back his hair and walked back to
the other officers.''
</P>
<P>
   Volpe's lawyer, Marvyn M. Kornberg, sought to undermine
Russell's credibility by citing contradictions between his
testimony Wednesday and what he had told investigators in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't like police officers, do you?'' the lawyer asked
after Russell had admitted he had cursed the officers after he saw
the man pushed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not true at all,'' Russell replied.
</P>
<P>
   Another witness, John Rejouis, a New York City correction
officer, testified that Volpe had pushed him to the ground after
Rejouis had tried to get to his car, and then had made motions as
if he daring Rejouis to fight him.
</P>
<P>
   Kornberg got Rejouis to admit he had had five or six drinks of
``straight rum'' in the hours before this happened, and suggested
he had been too drunk to know what had happened.

   Dr. J. John Sepkoski Jr., a professor and paleontologist at the
University of Chicago, who conducted important research
illuminating large-scale patterns of evolution in the fossil
record, died May 1 at his home in Chicago. He was 50.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure related to high blood pressure, said
Steve Koppes, news officer at the University of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues described Sepkoski as pivotal in changing
paleontology from a science often focused on the minutiae of
describing fossil species to one that employed quantitative studies
to understand evolutionary change over the course of the history of
life.
</P>
<P>
   He was also well known for the way he worked. In what 20 years
ago was a radically new style of research, Sepkoski identified
patterns of how life evolved on earth using huge compilations of
data gathered from numerous studies of fossils by many researchers
from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   In these databases, he recorded when groups of organisms first
appeared in the fossil record and when they disappeared or became
extinct. He gathered these data by searching the paleontological
literature, poring over obscure foreign language journals and
trying to turn a disparate collection of studies into a uniform
body of information.
</P>
<P>
   Just one study took a decade, as he noted in the title of a 1993
paper in the journal Paleobiology, ``Ten Years in the Library: New
Data Confirm Paleontological Patterns.'' He spent decades
continuing to build the database.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one had ever done it before,'' said Dr. Stephen Jay Gould,
a paleontologist at Harvard University, who was Sepkoski's graduate
school adviser. ``He compiled a completely consistent data set on
all groups, terrestrial, marine, single-celled, multicelled,
animals and plants, everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Sepkoski's most important finding, researchers say, was the
discovery of what appears to have been three distinct faunas, each
dominating hundreds of millions of years in the fossil record,
patterns never before documented or even proposed by others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack was the first one to recognize those,'' said Dr. Douglas
Erwin, a paleobiologist at the National Museum of Natural History
at the Smithsonian Institution. The effort, Erwin added, prompted
considerable follow-up research by others.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '80s, when I was in graduate school,'' he said, ``his
work influenced what most people did, what most people were
thinking about.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of Sepkoski's most famous papers, done with a close
colleague, Dr. David Raup, professor emeritus at the University of
Chicago, Sepkoski also reported evidence that mass extinctions
appeared to strike with regularity every 26 million years or so.
The findings, still the subject of heated debate, have provided
years of work for statisticians still studying the patterns of
extinctions and for paleontologists seeking possible causes for
such cycles
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues say Sepkoski helped develop not only new ways of
thinking about the fossil record but also new statistical methods
to deal with the enormous and unwieldy data required to answer the
field's new, broad-scale questions about the evolution of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack had remarkable mathematical skills,'' Gould said.
</P>
<P>
   Sepkoski is also credited with pushing the field of paleontology
toward greater quantitative rigor in what some describe as ``the
quantitative revolution.'' Because of Sepkoski and others at the
University of Chicago, in particular Raup, this new
number-crunching style of paleontology, also called analytical
paleontology, became known as the Chicago School.
</P>
<P>
   While other paleontologists earned reputations searching for
data with rock hammers in hand, Sepkoski was known for his
countless hours in the library, which he referred to as his ``field
site.'' But close colleagues said most researchers did not
recognize that Sepkoski was also an experienced field geologist.
</P>
<P>
   His son, David Sepkoski, a graduate student in the history of
science at University of Minnesota, often accompanied his father in
the field. He said his father's love of field geology was lifelong,
as Sepkoski had been a rock and fossil enthusiast as a child and
kept large collections of rocks he had amassed as a boy.
</P>
<P>
   But Sepkoski also was described by colleagues as a man with a
quirky sense of humor working in an office filled with little
plastic dinosaurs and the blaring sounds of musical groups like the
Sex Pistols and Spinal Tap.
</P>
<P>
   And in addition to his rock collections, he also favored more
unusual collections, including memorabilia of Elizabeth, the Queen
Mother, said his wife, Dr. Christine Janis, a paleobiologist at
Brown University.
</P>
<P>
   Sepkoski studied geology as an undergraduate at the University
of Notre Dame and received his doctorate at Harvard in geology and
paleontology, studying with Gould.
</P>
<P>
   Sepkoski then taught at the University of Rochester for four
years before moving to the University of Chicago in 1978. While
there, he was appointed a research associate at the Field Museum of
Natural History, and, at different times, held visiting
professorships at California Institute of Technology and Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Sepkoski was co-editor of the journal Paleobiology from 1983 to
1986. He was the Paleontological Society's president in 1995 and
1996. In 1983, the society recognized his contributions with the
Charles Schuchert Award.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife and son, he is survived by his father,
Joseph J. Sepkoski of Sparta, N.J.; two sisters, Carol Sepkoski of
Cambridge, Mass., and Diane Karl of Cedar Brook, N.J., and his
first wife, Maureen Meter of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us aren't going to be remembered in a hundred years'
time,'' said Erwin, the Smithsonian paleobiologist, ``but Jack
will, because he changed the way we think about the fossil record
and the history of life.''

AFTER OFFICERS' INDICTMENT IN DIALLO CASE, ARRESTS DROP IN NEW YORK
CITY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Arrests have fallen sharply in New York City in the
month since four officers were indicted in the fatal shooting of
Amadou Diallo, prompting concern among some officials about a
possible work slowdown by police officers.
</P>
<P>
   According to statistics released Wednesday by the Police
Department, the number of people arrested in April fell to 30,134,
from 35,813 in March, a 14 percent decline.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials attributed the decline in arrests to fewer
crimes being reported. They noted that complaints of crime were
down 12 percent in the first four months of this year compared with
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have fewer customers,'' said John Haviken, who heads the
department's Criminal Justice Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   But April's drop-off was considerably more pronounced than in
previous months, and crime rates have been falling for years even
as the number of arrests has risen. That has some law enforcement
officials searching for other explanations for April's decline,
including the possibility of fallout from the death of Diallo, an
unarmed African immigrant who died three months ago in a hail of
police bullets.
</P>
<P>
   On March 31, four officers were indicted on second-degree murder
charges in Diallo's death, prompting an angry response from
hundreds of police officers. Two weeks later, James Savage, the
president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, the city's
largest police union, urged officers to use ``maximum discretion''
when citing people for minor offenses.
</P>
<P>
   He said the city's crackdown on minor violations like drinking
alcohol in public had harmed relations between the police and the
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like it could be a slowdown,'' said one law
enforcement official.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Wednesday, Savage said he knew of no organized
effort to cut back on arrests, but he suggested that the decrease
might be related to low morale.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a morale problem out there in the precincts,'' Savage
said. ``I feel their anger, their mistrust of the city
administration. With morale down, it might affect productivity in a
negative way. Maybe they're not as anxious to go out there after
the petty offenders just for the sake of numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Reppetto, head of the Citizen's Crime Commission, said he
doubted that low morale or instructions from union leaders would
drive arrest rates in New York City. ``I think most police follow
the law and the directives of the department regardless of how they
feel,'' he said, ``and I don't know how much effect a union head
can have.''
</P>
<P>
   William J. Bratton, a former police commissioner under Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, said that if the decline in arrests was the
result of a slowdown by disgruntled officers, the numbers should
bounce back as tempers ease.
</P>
<P>
   More likely, Bratton said, last month's falloff in arrests could
be an early indication of a broader trend toward fewer arrests. He
said he had long predicted that arrests would inevitably fall as
the city became a more orderly place. He calls it the ``peacetime
dividend.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As I go around the city, I just don't see the kind of activity
that would draw a police officer's attention,'' Bratton said. ``At
some point in time, arrests are going to come down.''

 WILLIAM HUNTER McCREA, 94, EXPERT ON SUN'S COMPOSITION  
 (bl)  
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sir William Hunter McCrea, a British astronomer and
mathematician who as a young researcher advanced the knowledge of
the Sun's composition and more recently set forth his own theories
on the formation of planetary systems and galaxies, died April 25.
He was 94 and lived in Lewes, Sussex.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1920s, astrophysicists succeeded in debunking an ancient
proposition that the Sun was made up mostly of iron. The scientists
theorized that the Sun held many of the same gases and materials as
the earth.
</P>
<P>
   Later spectroscopy hinted at the presence of hydrogen in the
Sun's atmosphere, and the German astronomer Albrecht Unsoeld
suggested in 1928 that hydrogen, in fact, was the most common
element. William McCrea, a brilliant mathematician and research
student at Cambridge University, worked out the calculations to
confirm the hypothesis a year later.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmologists eventually established that all stars were composed
chiefly of hydrogen, a realization that turned their science into a
new direction. It also pointed toward the Big Bang theory of the
origin of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1960s, McCrea distanced himself from that theory of
a single Big Bang. He advanced his own interpretations that
indicated instead a series of bangs at different times and places
in the cosmos.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Dublin, William McCrea was educated at Cambridge and
the University of Goettingen. He returned to Cambridge and received
his Ph.D. there in 1929, then became a lecturer in mathematics at
Edinburgh University.
</P>
<P>
   He next moved to the University of London and the Imperial
College of Science. He remained associated with the University of
London until 1966, when he was appointed research professor of
theoretical astronomy at the University of Sussex. He took emeritus
status in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   He contributed papers to mathematical and astronomical journals
and translated Unsoeld's ``The New Cosmos'' (1969). His own books
included ``Relativity Physics'' (1935), ``Analytical Geometry of
Three Dimensions'' (1942), ``Physics of Sun and Stars'' (1950),
``The Royal Greenwich Observatory'' (1975), and ``History of the
Royal Astronomical Society, 1920 to 1980'' (1987).
</P>
<P>
   McCrea's wife, Marian Nicol Cole Webster McCrea, died in 1995
after 62 years of marriage. They had two daughters and a son.

SENATE DEFEATS CLINTON PROPOSALS TO OVERHAUL BANKS   
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN LABATON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Legislation to overhaul the nation's banking system
was significantly set back Wednesday after the Senate defeated two
measures endorsed by the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Leading Democrats predicted the votes would make it far more
difficult to enact a law to eliminate the Depression-era laws that
have made it difficult for banks, securities firms and insurance
companies to compete against one another. Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas,
who is the chief sponsor of the bill, threatened to pull his
measure from the floor if the Senate adopted an amendment sponsored
by Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., that would restore the Treasury
Department's authority to regulate banks. Republicans want the
Federal Reserve to have that regulatory authority.
</P>
<P>
   On a straight party vote of 54-to-43, the Republicans defeated a
substitute bill sponsored by the minority leader, Tom Daschle of
South Dakota, and Sen. Paul Sarbanes of Maryland, the ranking
Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate also defeated an amendment that would have eliminated
from the Republican legislation some of the provisions most
objectionable to the White House and Senate Democrats. Those
provisions would sharply limit the Community Reinvestment Act, a
1977 law that encourages lending to minorities, farmers and others
who have historically had little access to credit.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights groups criticized the votes as significant
setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The extreme measure of gutting the Community Reinvestment Act
accentuates the unfortunate partisan nature of this Congress,''
said Wade Henderson, executive director of the Leadership
Conference on Civil Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle and Sarbanes' alternative bill closely resembled one
jointly sponsored by Democrats and Republicans that failed last
year after running into opposition from Gramm, who is now the
chairman of the banking committee.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative measure, like the one sponsored by Gramm, would
remove barriers put in place by the Depression-era Glass-Steagle
Act to separate banks, insurance companies and securities firms.
</P>
<P>
   But there are several big differences between the bills that
have divided the lawmakers largely along partisan lines. The
Democratic measure would have retained a significant role for the
Treasury Department in regulating the growing number of financial
conglomerates, while the Republican version would give a leading
role largely to the Federal Reserve. The Democratic measure would
also have restricted the ability of commercial conglomerates from
entering into the banking business.
</P>
<P>
   The Gramm measure would make it more difficult for challenges to
the lending records of banks to be raised under the Community
Reinvestment Act. It would also exempt some 4,000 smaller
institutions from the Act's requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Adopted in 1977 to combat the banking practice of
``red-lining,'' or discriminating against poorer and minority
neighborhoods, the Community Reinvestment Act has become a central
battle ground in the new legislation. Many lobbyists say that if an
agreement can be reached on the Community Reinvestment Act, then
Congress will be able to complete landmark legislation on the
financial system.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic leaders in the Senate contend that the Republican
legislation will be doomed unless Gramm eliminates the Community
Reinvestment Act provisions from the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The failure to proceed on a bipartisan track has placed this
bill in unnecessary risk,'' Daschle said.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic amendment to strip the provisions and expand the
application of the act to some financial conglomerates failed on a
vote of 52 to 45.

FCC CHAIRMAN URGES MORE SPENDING FOR SCHOOL INTERNET PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The chairman of the Federal Communications
Commission, William Kennard, said Wednesday that he would urge the
commission to increase spending for a program that collects a fee
on telephone bills and devotes the money to help schools and
libraries in low-income areas connect to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Under Kennard's plan, the program would spend $2.25 billion a
year. It now spends about $1.35 billion a year after Kennard agreed
to reduce the level last year to win approval.
</P>
<P>
   Because Kennard is a Democrat and is likely to have the backing
of the two other Democrats on the five-member commission _ Susan
Ness and Gloria Tristani _ he is expected to win the increased
spending for the program.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress have said that they want the program,
which is called E-rate discounts, to spend less, not more, money.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Johnson, the spokesman for Rep. W.J. (Billy) Tauzin, the
chairman of the House subcommittee concerned with
telecommunications, said Republicans would introduce a bill to
eliminate the fee and reduce the spending on the Internet
connection program to $1.7 billion a year, paid for by the existing
federal telephone tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in effect a tax on talking, and that's why conservatives
are against it,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The E-rate program subsidizes the cost of connecting to Internet
providers and of internal connections inside schools and libraries.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said the public was getting ``hoodwinked'' because some
recipients used the money for related projects such as ripping out
and replacing walls and removing asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard, though, said the program was working.
</P>
<P>
   E-rate discounts went to more than 80,000 schools and libraries
last year, Kennard said at a meeting called to promote higher
spending on the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over 38 million kids _ from the deep woods of the Pacific
Northwest to the inner-city neighborhoods of Chicago, from a
parochial school in Montana to a yeshiva in Queens _ are now
connected to the Internet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute goes back to a time before phone deregulation when
the federal government required the telephone companies to charge
more to higher-income customers so that there was enough money to
subsidize the service to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   In this way, for example, urban customers subsidized the rural,
and long-distance callers subsidized local ones.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC said that telephone bills should not go up despite
increased spending for the E-rate program because long-distance
carriers will be getting a reduction in the connection fees they
pay to local telephone companies. &QL;

MAE BERTHA CARTER, MOTHER WHO DEFIED SEGREGATION LAW, DIES AT 76  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mae Bertha Carter, who defied gunfire and the loss of employment
to send her children to previously all-white public schools in
Mississippi, eventually winning a legal battle that confirmed their
right to be there, died on April 28 at her home in Drew, Miss. She
was 76.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said Francine E. Cheeks, a spokeswoman for
the American Friends Service Committee in Philadelphia, a Quaker
organization that supported Ms. Carter and many other black
families in the civil rights struggle of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carter was born on Jan. 13, 1923, in Sunflower County, Miss.
She married Matthew Carter in 1939, and the couple became
sharecroppers, raising 25 acres of cotton and sharing the income
with the landowners, on Pemble Plantation, near Drew.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1965, just after the Carters had enrolled 7 of
their 13 children in local white schools, the owner of the
plantation told them to withdraw the children, saying they would
receive a better education in a black school.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carter's response was to take an old phonograph onto the
porch and play a recording of a speech by President John F. Kennedy
on civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I birthed those children and bore the pain,'' she later told
her husband. Referring to the plantation owner, she said, ``He
cannot tell me what to do about my children.''
</P>
<P>
   Public schools throughout Mississippi were desegregated by the
Civil Rights Act of 1964, but the state enacted what it called a
freedom-of-choice law and used it to intimidate blacks into
remaining at inferior black schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Carters, however, resolutely kept their children in the
once-segregated white schools, even though their house was once
riddled with bullets in the middle of the night and they were
eventually evicted, losing their income and their house.
</P>
<P>
   From 1965 to 1968, the Carters were the only black family to
keep their children in the county's schools.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967 the Carters and Marian Wright Edelman, a lawyer with the
NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc., sued the Drew school
district, challenging the state freedom-of-choice law. They won the
suit in 1969, removing the last legal hurdle to the desegregation
of Mississippi's public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, eight of the Carter's children graduated from what
had been all-white schools in Sunflower County; five older children
graduated from local black schools. Eleven also graduated from
college _ seven from the once-segregated University of Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the Carter family's battle was recounted in a book,
``Silver Rights'' (Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill, 1995) by
Constance Curry, a field worker with the American Friends Service
Committee in 1966, who worked closely with the family. The title is
an old rural-black colloquial abridgment, noted by the novelist
Alice Walker, of the phrase ``civil rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Carter's husband, Matthew, died in 1988. She is survived by
five sons, Carl, of Columbus, Miss., Stanley, of Tulsa, Okla.,
Larry, of Hampton, Va., John, of Lake Charles, La., and Matthew
Jr., of Conway, Ark.; eight daughters, Beverly Carter of Drew,
Naomi Granberry of Cleveland, Miss., Pearl Owen and Deborah Smith,
both of Oxford, Miss., Gloria Dickenson of Battle Creek, Mich.,
Ruth Whittle and Bertha Huckleby, both of Toledo, Ohio, and Edna
Threats of Kansas City, Kan., 35 grandchildren and 36
great-grandchildren.

MACY'S SPINOFF SOUSON AIMS AT IMPULSE MARKET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ENRIQUE RIVERO  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Tapping into one of the hottest areas in
retailing today, Macy's department store is spinning off a new
chain of stores specializing in beauty products, candles and other
``impulse'' merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   The Southern California testing ground for the new concept --
called Souson: A Little Something Extra from Macy's -- is the
Westfield Shoppingtown Topanga Plaza in Canoga Park in the city's
suburban San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The local store, expected to open in early June, will be Macy's
second Souson. The first opened April 30 in San Jose, said Betty
Krogh, a spokeswoman for Macy's West in San Francisco. Others could
follow, depending on how well the originals perform.
</P>
<P>
   Macy's doesn't have a department store in Topanga Plaza, but it
does have one in the nearby Westfield Shoppingtown Promenade in
Woodland Hills. Both malls are owned by Los Angeles-based real
estate investment trust Westfield America Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Topanga Plaza) has a great reputation in the Valley and
we don't have representation there,'' Krogh said. ``I'm a Valley
Girl and used to go to that mall on the bus all the time. It's a
great mall.''
</P>
<P>
   Souson should ``seduce'' mall customers in the same way that
they're lured by impulse items such as cosmetics and fragrances as
they make their way through Macy's aisles, Krogh said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impulsive,'' Krogh said. ``You're walking and you have an
opportunity to pass the shop and you say: This is a great new shop,
I'm going to walk in.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the San Jose store, the local 4,500-square-foot Souson will
carry a broad line of makeup and fragrances, as well as related
products such as cosmetics bags, brushes, applicators, potpourri
and candles, according to officials with Cincinnati-based Federated
Department Stores, which owns Macy's.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmetics will include Shiseido, Elizabeth Arden, Christian Dior
and Benefit. Souson will also carry British hairstylist Charles
Worthington's line of hair-care products.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Souson merchandise isn't sold in Macy's. This
includes the Worthington line -- for the time being, at least,
Krogh said -- some decorative items, candles, hair ornaments and
brushes.
</P>
<P>
   The market for decorative items, candles and the like has heated
up of late, and stores specializing in this merchandise are
springing up everywhere, said Jackie Fernandez, director of the
retail services group for accounting firm Deloitte &AMP; Touche LLP in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Candle retailers such as Illuminations and the Yankee Candle
Co., for example, have opened or plan to open outlets in the
Topanga Plaza and Northridge Fashion Center, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Given enough product differentiation, Macy's doesn't run the
risk of competing against itself, Fernandez said. And if the price
point is low enough, Souson should compete well against similar
stores such as Bath &AMP; Body Works.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, Macy's name recognition is sure to help, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a good move (and) I think they've got the
know-how to make this concept work well,'' Fernandez said. ``It's
an area of the retail industry that's hot. People are interested in
candles and home decoration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good area to hop into,'' she said.

EDITORIAL:THE POLITICS OF HURRICANE RELIEF 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Thursday, May 6: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The victims of Hurricane Mitch, which ravaged Central America
six months ago, are still waiting for $600 million in promised
humanitarian aid from the United States. Congress seems willing to
make them wait forever. The money is stalled in a partisan fight
that has nothing to do with the merits of helping Honduras,
Nicaragua and other countries hit by the storm and other natural
disasters.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle in Congress is over compensating budget cuts, or
``offsets'' in Washington jargon. The aid bill passed both the
House and Senate accompanied by cuts in valuable programs _ to help
dispose of uranium and plutonium in Russia, to protect embassies
from terrorism and provide relief for domestic disasters, for
example. The administration has reasonably said it will veto a bill
containing these measures, and argues _ correctly _ that the budget
rules do not require balancing cuts in emergency aid such as this.
</P>
<P>
   Congress exposed the hollowness of its call for fiscal
responsibility by tacking projects onto the bill such as aid to
steel and oil companies. By contrast, an emergency spending bill to
pay for humanitarian relief and military expenses in Kosovo that
will be voted on Thursday in the House will contain no compensating
cuts. Indeed, it will include $7 billion in extra defense spending
that the Pentagon did not request.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane aid package contains money to reimburse the
Pentagon for its role in relief efforts after the hurricane, and
some to the Immigration Service for detention of illegal aliens.
But $600 million would go to Central America, with additional money
to the Caribbean nations struck by Hurricane Georges, and to
Colombia for earthquake relief. In Central America a new planting
season is arriving, and money is needed for seeds and agricultural
credits. Holding these funds hostage to a political squabble is
shameful.

   RAMSTEIN AIR BASE, Germany _ President Clinton rallied U.S.
forces participating in NATO's air war against Yugoslavia on
Wednesday, but the day was marred by a helicopter crash that killed
two American pilots, the first allied fatalities associated with
the six-week-old campaign.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with NATO commanders, U.S. troops and three
American soldiers released Sunday from Yugoslav captivity, Clinton
was scheduled to visit Thursday with ethnic Albanian refugees and
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder before returning to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, part of the national
security entourage accompanying Clinton, was to peel off Thursday
to meet in Bonn with her Russian and European counterparts in what
could be a pivotal moment in the effort to broker peace in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's meeting will group foreign ministers from the
so-called Group of Eight, or G-8. Those countries are the United
States, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   NATO is insisting that Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic, president
of Yugoslavia, agree to a number of conditions, including the
admission of a heavily-armed NATO-led peacekeeping force into
Kosovo, before any halt in bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has so far publicly rejected that demand, saying that
he would accept only a lightly-armed civilian monitoring regime
under the auspices of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reported that Russia -- which has close
historical and diplomatic ties to Yugoslavia -- might be near
enough to accepting the NATO position to agree to a joint statement
to that affect on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Such a declaration would mark a major -- and perhaps decisive --
move forward in the search for a diplomatic solution to the
conflict. It would not necessarily end it right away, however,
because it is Milosevic, not Moscow, that ultimately must agree.
</P>
<P>
   In a move likely to be interpreted in Belgrade as a goodwill
gesture, Defense Secretary William Cohen said he was poised to
recommend that Clinton order the release -- perhaps in the coming
days -- of two Yugoslav soldiers held in U.S. custody.
</P>
<P>
   ``At an appropriate time, I would recommend that,'' Cohen told
reporters. ``I would expect within a relatively short period of
time that we could see their release.''
</P>
<P>
   The two Yugoslav soldiers -- each a private in his early 20s --
were captured by guerilla fighters belonging to the Kosovo
Liberation Army, or KLA, an ethnic Albanian rebel group that
supports independence for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA troops turned the captives over to the government of
Albania, which then placed them in the custody of U.S. military
personnel there.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth H. Bacon said it was possible that
the Yugoslav captives could be turned over to a third country -- he
mentioned Sweden as a possibility -- for processing back to
Yugoslavia. The United States and Yugoslavia broke off formal
diplomatic relations after the NATO air strikes commenced March 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure of their status and make sure that the
International Committee of the Red Cross has an opportunity to see
them, interview them and then complete some administrative work.''
</P>
<P>
   That process, Cohen said, could take several days.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen denied any link between the Yugoslav prisoners and the
Americans released in Belgrade last weekend. Both moves come,
however, amid mounting indications that both NATO and Milosevic are
searching for a diplomatic way out of a conflict that entered its
seventh inconclusive week with attacks across Yugoslavia early
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and allied military officials told Clinton that NATO air
strikes are hitting hard at Yugoslav forces across the embattled
province of Kosovo, where alliance warplanes are having increasing
success hunting down individual tanks, artillery batteries and
fielded forces and destroying them on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   Despite deteriorating weather, alliance pilots destroyed 40 such
targets in strikes late Tuesday and early Wednesday, NATO officials
said, promising that the pressure on Yugoslav forces in the field
would mount further in the days to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they move, when they're in the open, they're seen. And
when they're seen, they're hit. And when they're hit, they're
killed,'' said NATO's supreme commander, U.S. Army Gen. Wesley
Clark. ``We're going to pin them down, close them out and take them
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the tough rhetoric, Clark conceded that, after 15,000
sorties, nearly one-third of which were strike missions, NATO has
yet to halt the military onslaught that has driven an estimated 1.5
million ethnic Albanians from their homes in Kosovar.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are thousands, still, paramilitary thugs committing
murder and mayhem on the ground in Kosovo,'' Clark told reporters
at a press conference at Spangdahlem Air Base. U.S. pilots have
been flying F-16 fighter-bomber and F-117 stealth bomber missions
into the skies over the Yugoslav state of Serbia, of which Kosovo
is a part, from the base.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ask so much of you, and you never let us down,'' Clinton
said to a crowd of perhaps 2,500 Air Force personnel and their
families who gathered beneath a cavernous hanger. Behind the dais
where Clinton spoke stood a steely grey F-16 and an American flag
two stories high. ``Night after night, to Serbia, punching through
enemy defenses, putting ordinance on target, returning home to
debrief, rest and then do it all over again. That takes courage and
skill and a lot of support that we must never take for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   The visit gave troops a boost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The President coming to see us, means that what we're doing
here is really important,'' said Air Force Staff Sgt. Thomas Abram,
32, of Milwaukee, a crew chief in charge of keeping F-16s
flightworthy. ``It keeps moral up.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit was haunted by a grim reminder of the dangers
pilots face.
</P>
<P>
   In Albania, near the Kosovo border, two American pilots were
killed when the Apache attack helicopter they were flying crashed
during night training exercises in support of Operation Allied
Force.
</P>
<P>
   The accident, which occurred when the pilots were practicing
tree-top level attack maneuvers over tricky terrain, was the second
such crash since the Apaches deployed to Albania in mid-April. The
crew of the two-seat Apache that crashed last week survived with
minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon identified the pilots killed early Wednesday as
Chief Warrant Officer David A. Gibbs, 38, from Massillon, Ohio, and
Chief Warrant Officer Kevin Reichert, 28, of Chetek, Wis. They were
members of the Germany-based 6th Cavalry Regiment, which arrived
last month.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the crash was under investigation. The training,
however, involved obvious hazards: streaking just above the
treetops through the blackness of night over hilly terrain at
speeds that can top 180 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost two brave Americans,'' Clinton said of the pilots.
``And today we grieve with their families and pray for them.''
</P>
<P>
   At this sprawling base of U.S. Air Force cargo aircraft, which
have been flying humanitarian aid missions to provide assistance to
refugees in camps along Kosovo's border, Clinton shared a happier
moment with three U.S. soldiers who were released last Sunday from
a month of captivity in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke privately and separately with each of the three --
Spec. Steven M. Gonzales, 22, of Huntsville, Texas., Staff Sgt.
Andrew Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles; and Staff Sgt. Christopher
Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich. -- and their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of them,'' Clinton told reporters during a photo op
with the freed troops. ``I'm just glad to have these people home --
halfway home anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   As NATO's air campaign entered its seventh week, Clark said he
expects to add some 250 U.S. warplanes to the operation in the
coming weeks. That would raise to nearly 1,000 the number of attack
and support aircraft in the NATO armada.
</P>
<P>
   Clark has asked for the additional strike craft, refueling
tankers and reconnaissance planes as part of a larger request for
about 300 planes. About 40 have been provided and Clark has been
working with the governments of Hungary, Bulgaria and other Balkan
nations to secure bases for the additional aircraft or permission
to overfly those countries' air space.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told the president that everything is on track,'' Clark
said. ``We expect the full flow of assets within the next 30
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Hungary has agreed to allow some NATO aircraft to fly missions
from its bases. On Tuesday Bulgaria's parliament voted to allow
NATO planes to fly in its air space. Those developments would give
U.S. and allied pilots new routes of attack.

`NORTH CASCADES CREST' CAPTURES THE VISUAL POETRY OF `AMERICA'S
ALPS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fierce and fiercely beautiful terrain of Washington's North
Cascades has inspired poets, but curiously resisted accurate
depiction in photography and literature.
</P>
<P>
   Just getting into the core of the range is so difficult that the
telephoto lens is often used to simulate views available to those
who use their legs. Mount Shuksan is carefully framed in tarns a
few feet from the Mount Baker Highway. Mount Baker is made to grow
out of the roofs of Skagit Valley farmhouses.
</P>
<P>
   In James Martin, however, the mountains have found an author
with music in his soul and a photographer steeped in swirling
clouds and distinctive North Cascades light. He is also a climber
who gets to places where he does not need to play telephoto tricks.
</P>
<P>
   ``North Cascades Crest: Notes and Images from America's Alps,''
is a celebration of the wildest spots in the range, mile-high walls
in the Northern Pickets and the infrequently visited swath of
icefields between the North Cascades Highway and the remote Park
Creek Pass. Non-climbers can enjoy a few of these places, such as
Trapper Peak and Sourdough Mountain, accessible by
</P>
<P>
   steep trails out of the Skagit.
</P>
<P>
   As a young hiker, Martin ran into poet Gary Snyder in the Sierra
Nevadas who told Martin of his summers as a fire lookout atop
Sourdough. He writes movingly of days when poets manned lookouts
high above the Skagit. A funny interval is his account of Allen
Ginsburg running into a fisherman on the trail and telling him:
``We are forest beatniks.''
</P>
<P>
   The most intriguing episode is that of Jack Kerouac, who spent a
summer of solitude atop Desolation Peak east of Ross Lake,
entranced by the black towers of Hozomeen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years of life on the road had ground him down,'' writes
Martin. ``Drugs, booze, false friends, hostile cops, and other
tortures left him exhausted and despairing despite his huge
appetite for life. Desolation Peak cleared his perception. He had
the time to wrestle his demons to a draw, at least temporarily.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid his outstanding photographs, Martin has time to muse. He is
fascinated that peaks bear such names as Terror, Fury, Triumph,
Despair, Inspiration and Forbidden. He traces the path of a young
Seattle teenager named Fred Beckey, who made his initial first
ascent in 1939 (Mount Despair) and a year later took major summits
of the Pickets by storm. It was the kickoff of a 60-year career of
scaling walls from the Bugaboos of British Columbia to the
Himalayas.
</P>
<P>
   Using his camera, Martin shows off the Cascades at sunset, with
sunlight turning clouds into ``a tapestry of reds, yellows and
oranges.'' In words, he details less uplifting Cascade experiences
_ retreating from the Ptarmigan Traverse in a downpour, sweating
through brush of Downey Creek, and trying to find a route across
brushy, rain-slick hillsides.
</P>
<P>
   In a couple of places, he does let the telephoto run wild.
``Dome Peak dominates the skyline from Sahale Peak,'' reads one
caption. It doesn't. Dome is quite some distance from Sahale, and
appears as but one of numerous summits visible in this finest of
all views down the spine of the range.
</P>
<P>
   Other shots legitimately take the breath away, such as the
northeast buttress of Mount Slesse, just over the border in British
Columbia. Slesse is a Salish word meaning ``fang.'' Never was a
mountain better named.
</P>
<P>
   Old-line conservation groups have a curious attitude toward the
North Cascades. When public support was needed for preservation,
the Sierra Club and the Seattle-based Mountaineers group published
picture and guidebooks to encourage attention. After the creation
of parks and wilderness areas, they have seemed intent on limiting
access.
</P>
<P>
   Martin parrots the party line: Not enough land is protected. A
proliferation of backpackers threatens to spoil everything. ``We
foul the water and spook the wildlife,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast! Thanks to hikers, the North Cascades are the most
protected mountains of the ``lower 48'' states. The area Martin is
writing about contains a national park, three national recreation
areas, and four wilderness areas.
</P>
<P>
   Martin ignores the real tale of degradation, though he doubtless
witnessed it when hiking to remote Mount Redoubt via Depot Creek, a
valley that crosses the U.S.-Canadian border near Chilliwack Lake.
</P>
<P>
   The British Columbia Forest Service allowed Depot Creek to be
logged almost to the border. Similar vast clearcuts reach nearly to
timberline, and right up to the boundary, in several areas that are
protected on the U.S. side.
</P>
<P>
   Canadians love to preach at international environmental
conferences. In the North Cascades, however, it is the Yanks who
walked their talk. And, for the most part, so has James Martin in
this splendid celebration of a unique and dramatic corner of
America.

EDITORIAL: FIXING THE FIGHT GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Thursday, May 6: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The outrageous judges' decision in March's heavyweight title
fight between Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis embarrassed New
York's politicians. They had hoped for a fight that would establish
an undisputed heavyweight champion and lead to a rebirth of
big-time boxing in the state. What they got was a verdict that
turned a clear victory for Lewis into a draw. Wednesday two of
these officials, Gov. George Pataki and Attorney General Eliot
Spitzer, answered with modest reforms and suggestions for bigger
changes that could weaken the grip of boxing's monopolists.
</P>
<P>
   One change will give the state athletic commission final say
over the selection of the judges in all title bouts. Under current
procedures, judges are in effect chosen by boxing's three ratings
organizations. Another reform will require judges to disclose
personal financial information to the commission before a fight.
Both reforms flow directly from questions raised about the only
judge who actually scored the fight for Holyfield, Eugenia
Williams. Mrs. Williams was chosen by the International Boxing
Federation, whose champion happens to be Holyfield. The IBF also
has close ties to Don King, who owns Holyfield's contract and
naturally stood to benefit by a decision that allowed Holyfield to
preserve his share of the championship. A few days after the fight
it was disclosed that Mrs. Williams had declared personal
bankruptcy before the bout. Mrs. Williams has denied that she was
offered financial help to influence her verdict. Even so, the steps
announced Wednesday will help insure that judges are not
compromised in future bouts.
</P>
<P>
   The two officials also pledged to fight for other reforms. One
intriguing idea would establish an independent boxing poll similar
to the college football polls. Boxers are now ranked by the three
ratings organizations, which routinely manipulate the rankings to
generate legitimacy for fights that should never occur, just to
guarantee a fat payday for favored promoters.
</P>
<P>
   What boxing really needs is some sort of national regulation, so
that shady promoters cannot simply shift their fights to states
with more lenient rules. A bill sponsored by Sen. John McCain would
help meet that need. But for now, it is gratifying to see New York
taking tangible steps to clean up a dishonest sport.

CLAIRVOYANT BUFFY HOLDS HER FIRE  
 ANCHOR AWAY: DOWNS SIGNS OFF 
EX-PRESIDENT DOLE KEEPS A PROMISE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Kan., Ohio)  (rk) 
 By JAMES BARRON with YASMIN NAMINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Will WB, Time Warner's youth-oriented network, which
postponed last week's episode of ``Buffy, the Vampire Slayer''
because it seemed to be setting the stage for a high school rampage
so soon after the one in Littleton, Colo., think twice about the
season finale?
</P>
<P>
   The episode not shown last week featured the clairvoyant title
character, played by Sarah Michelle Gellar, reading her high school
classmates' minds. She realized that someone was thinking about
killing everyone in school _ everyone, that is, except the
vampires. (Remember, guns don't kill vampires, vampire slayers do,
but only with weapons like crossbows that do not discharge
bullets.)
</P>
<P>
   In the two-part finale, scheduled to be broadcast in a couple of
weeks at the height of the May ratings sweeps, a cataclysmic
``ascension'' takes place on graduation day, said someone who saw
the outline for the episode.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the high school students arm themselves in
anticipation of the `ascension,''' he said. ``It's 100 percent in
the realm of fantasy, but it's still high school students with
weapons. Of course, there's a huge distinction between this and the
catastrophe at Columbine. I don't recall anything in the outline
that mentioned semiautomatics or pipe bombs, but attendant to the
ascension there is a lot of carnage.''
</P>
<P>
   No decision about the episode has been made, a WB spokesman
said. ``It's something that we're looking at,'' he said. ``Last
week, it was just too close, and we're too cautious.''
</P>
<P>
   Anchor Away: Downs Signs Off &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sixty years ago, the year that Hollywood released ``The Wizard
of Oz,'' `` Smith Goes to Washington'' and ``Gone With the Wind,''
18-year-old Hugh Downs signed on as a staff announcer at WLOK-AM in
Lima, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually he switched to a medium in which he was seen as well
as heard. He was Jack Paar's announcer on ``Tonight'' from 1957 to
1962, the host of the game show ``Concentration'' and a host of
``Today'' from 1962 to 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, ABC News said that Downs, 78, was leaving
broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time for me to move on,'' he said, adding that he was
planning something ``in the context of new media.'' He did not say
what. Leaving ABC News, he said, would let him do things that ``I
cannot do under a network news policy, a policy with which I
agree.'' Meaning, make commercials? ``Yes, that kind of thing,'' he
said, ``and making speeches and going on other venues like cable.''
</P>
<P>
   Downs, who has been an anchor on the ABC News magazine ``20/20''
for 21 years, told network officials some time ago that he was not
interested in negotiating a new contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little nervous about that,'' he said. ``I didn't want
them to go through some embarrassing thing of offering more money,
because it wasn't about money, and they didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   His current contract expires in October. He will continue to
appear on ``20/20'' until then.
</P>
<P>
   Ex-President Dole Keeps a Promise &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole is not in Kansas anymore. Wednesday, Mrs. Dole,
the former president of the American Red Cross who wants to be
president of a somewhat larger outfit, was in Manhattan, where she
was the guest of honor at a lunch sponsored by The Ladies' Home
Journal. She was far from her home state, where tornadoes left a
trail of devastation earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your life goes on,'' she said in the receiving line. ``I have
a commitment to be here and I couldn't cancel this commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   A moment later, she reached across Libby Pataki, wife of New
York Gov. George Pataki, and added, ``If I didn't have this
commitment, of course I'd be in Kansas.''

 FIRST UNION CORP. IS SUED OVER 401(k) SWITCH  
 (bl)  
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   John T.H. Carpenter, a loan officer with Signet Bank in Virginia
Beach, Va., put his 401(k) savings into three investments that
turned in sizzling performances in recent years. So when he quit in
November 1997, a week before First Union Corp. took over Signet, he
left those investments in place.
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, Carpenter found that First Union had replaced
his investments with First Union brand mutual funds, which would be
much less profitable. And, he learned, First Union charges full
fees to its own employees' accounts, though it often waives
administrative fees for large 401(k) plans it administers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have made $50,000 in those few months from just one of
my investments,'' he said, referring to Capital One Financial, the
credit card company spun off from Signet. Instead, he earned about
5 percent annually because those proceeds were invested in the
First Union Stable Value fund, one of nine funds offered to
employees for 401(k)'s.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter and eight other participants in the Signet plan
Wednesday sued First Union, the nation's sixth-largest bank, saying
5,000 former Signet workers would have $150 million more today if
First Union had not moved $100 million to its own mutual funds,
none of which have performed nearly as well as the three
investments they were forced to leave: the Vanguard Index 500 fund,
the American Century Ultra fund and shares of Capital One.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Richmond, contends
that First Union violated the terms of the Signet plan, did not
notify people like Carpenter that they could withdraw their money
and breached its duty of loyalty to those workers so that it could
collect more fee income.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for First Union, Ken Darby, said it had no comment
on the litigation. The company has told complaining workers,
however, that it sent them notification letters before the change.
</P>
<P>
   More than 32 million workers now save through 401(k)-type plans,
investing about $2 billion a week. The case raises issues that
could affect anyone whose employer merges with another company that
has different 401(k) investment options.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement law experts said Wednesday that the case could become
one of the most significant brought in the 25 years since Congress
enacted the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or Erisa.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Cummings, a Washington lawyer who represents companies,
said there would be no case had First Union replaced the Signet
investments with funds it does not own. And he said a bank could
invest 401(k) money in its own mutual funds under some
circumstances. ``This case is going to depend on whether there are
smoking pistols that show that these First Union guys had some
ulterior motive'' like collecting fees by moving the investment to
the bank's own mutual funds, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Gordon, a Washington retirement lawyer who represents
workers, said that ``switching employees of an acquired company
whole hog into proprietary funds is extremely troublesome and,
regardless of the technicalities under Erisa, is an obnoxious
practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lieder and Eli Gootesdiener, the Washington lawyers who
filed the case, said they would show that First Union's motive in
changing the investments was increasing its fee income.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter said he complained in May 1998 that he was never told
that his investments would be sold. He said First Union then sent
him a copy of the notice it said it had mailed him and the address
to which it had been mailed. ``The address First Union listed was a
house that when they say the notice was sent had not been built
yet,'' he said of the house, where he now lives.

BOMBING MEMORIES SHAPE RESPONSE TO NEW TRAGEDY
</HEADLINE>
 VU-WRITETHRU-TEX 
EDS: Changes date of Oklahoma City bombing to 1995 sted 1994. (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MILES MOFFEIT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY _ The question nagged at rescue workers and
government officials as they spent the first grueling hours
throwing blankets over victims and maneuvering around crackling
power lines to survey the tornado's massive damage.
</P>
<P>
   How could such destruction visit Oklahoma City again?
</P>
<P>
   Barely four years after a bomb devastated downtown Oklahoma City
in the country's deadliest terrorist attack, many people have found
themselves facing the same shocking realities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Few towns have seen anything as horrific as this,'' Gov. Frank
Keating said Wednesday, his shoes caked with mud as he talked with
dozens of the newly homeless at the First Baptist Church of Moore.
``But we've done it before and will do it again. We'll dig
ourselves out of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma City addressed the bombing tragedy in several ways that
could ultimately speed emotional and financial recovery from the
tornadoes that left thousands homeless, more than 500 injured and
at least 38 dead this week, community leaders say.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is difficult to measure, many city leaders say a
powerful community spirit bred partly from the April 19, 1995,
bombing of the Murrah Building is carrying Oklahoma City through
its latest nightmare. That's evident in the mobilization of
thousands of volunteers and the spontaneous acts of giving this
week, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Alliances that grew out of the bombing's aftermath are also at
work. The state of Oklahoma and nonprofit groups created the
Resource Committee, to steers donations to families affected by the
bombing who can't afford to put their children through college.
That group plans to help the tornado victims as well, Keating said.
</P>
<P>
   And new disaster relief strategies, such as the American Red
Cross' methods of dispatching numerous counseling teams to ease the
mental anguish of victims and rescue workers, were on display in
Moore, one of the hardest-hit suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, at least 20 counselors were trudging through ruined
neighborhoods in Moore and creating ``private spaces'' at shelters
for immediate therapy. More counselors are on the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The larger counselor volunteer base we're using today came out
of the bombing,'' said Timothy Sartorius, chief executive officer
of the Central Oklahoma Chapter of the American Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Said John Clizbe, vice president of the National Red Cross, who
helped respond to the bombing: ``That event took the stigma out of
counseling.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Federal Emergency Management Agency said
Wednesday that they have expanded use of search and rescue teams,
which primarily use dogs to sniff out victims, because they were so
effective after the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Although the bombing exacted a huge toll on human lives, many
people were talking Wednesday about something powerful that endured
from that disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Keating calls it ``extreme outpourings of goodness.''
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred businesses have pledged money or support.
Reports are rampant about residents catching sight of area relief
workers in public and hastily writing checks to help the effort.
People have jammed the highways to approach churches and nonprofit
groups with donations.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous hotels, such as the Marriott Hotel Corp., are donating
temporary shelter space and free phone lines for long-distance
calls to relatives. Universities are donating dormitory rooms. The
stories go on and on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the bombing tragedy, people are grouping fast,''
said the Rev. Ronnie Harrison of the Heartland Harvest Church in
Norman.
</P>
<P>
   Keating, as he was after the bombing, has been a continuous
fixture at disaster relief scenes this week, reaching out to the
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, families at a Red Cross station held plastic bags
full of diapers and food as they crowded around the governor to
tell their stories.
</P>
<P>
   One family said their home had been replaced by a 30-foot-high
stack of debris. They said they don't know how the pile can ever be
removed. Another family recalled watching as its cars blew into the
sky.
</P>
<P>
   Keating said that insurance companies and federal aid will help
with some of the problems. He said he will organize a meeting of
area mayors to gauge progress in the rescue effort and to determine
``where to go from here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These things help bring us together. People coming together
have helped stitch this city together,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bud Parrish, missions minister with the First Baptist Church of
Moore, said Oklahoma City residents are obviously dealing with many
of the same horrors that they faced after the bombing. They will
need to express their pain in different ways, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the community can persevere by putting its trust in a
higher power, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an act of faith,'' he said. ``We let people get angry and
you take the anger and find trust in God.''

GRAPHIC VISION: ART FOR PEOPLE, NOT ARTISTS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOYCE WADLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There are a million stories in the naked city, but if
they involve the night workers who clean the toilets and make the
subways run on time, who cares?
</P>
<P>
   The little drama of the aspiring comic book artist who works as
a topless dancer and loses her wallet with the rent money: so what?
</P>
<P>
   The subway worker who works the graveyard shift and finds solace
in the company of rats: who wants to read about him?
</P>
<P>
   But no! In a project called ``The Invisible City,'' the stories
of some of the night shift workers who make the city run, told in
comic book panels, will be on placards throughout the subways until
the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Using their own computer program _ ZAP! or perhaps we should
say, CLICK! _ which transforms photos to comic illustrations, two
artists, Christopher J. Sperandio, who lives in Manhattan, and
Simon Grennan, who lives in England, have made the workers comic
heroes.
</P>
<P>
   How did the artists get the idea?
</P>
<P>
   Frame One: Sperandio, 35, sitting in the Manhattan office of the
Public Art Fund, because he's self-conscious about the studio
apartment he shares with his wife. Black T-shirt, black shirt,
black sports jacket, buttoned up. (GADZOOKS! The sign of a fellow
self-conscious about his weight? Hair a downtown mix of peroxide
blond and brown. Box of Pepperidge Farm cookies, plateless,
unadorned, real, furnished by artist, on the table. Artist will eat
the most.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been working as a graphic artist at one of those desks
in a cubicle farm in a corporate office. I don't want to name them
because I don't want to plug them.''
</P>
<P>
   Frame Two, noir office, the artist as drone:
</P>
<P>
   ``I was working from noon to 8, kind of a bridge person between
the day people and the night people, and I realized that they were
completely oblivious of one another, though they shared the same
space. So in the morning, it would be: `Why is the mouse pad over
here?' The day person would be right-handed but the night person
left-handed, and they would not know.''
</P>
<P>
   Frame Three, top of the artist's head.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hair? I had always wanted to dye it and now I've started
losing it, so I've dyed it all these different colors in the last
few months. I've been red, black, blond, now crazy, for a while
Chromatique _ that's this bright, bright red.''
</P>
<P>
   There are artists who feel they must be true to their vision,
the public be dashed. This has never been the case of Sperandio,
raised in the town of Kingwood, W.Va., whose father worked as a
lineman for the power company and whose mother worked in the
unemployment office.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Sperandio, who put himself through college with scholarships
and construction work, and met Grennan while they were doing
graduate work at the University of Illinois in Chicago, felt art
should be relevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simon and I were very dissatisfied with the role of the
artist,'' says Sperandio, who, while his heart is with the workers,
talks about art theory till you turn bright, bright blue. ``I had
trouble reconciling my working-class background with the nature of
contemporary art. Essentially, they're class issues, issues about
the social role of the artist. Like, remember Tilted Arc, the Serra
sculpture at Federal Plaza?''
</P>
<P>
   (Comic book cue, Frame One: A 120-foot long, 12-foot high slab
of curved steel, in lower Manhattan. Next Frame: Federal Plaza
without the steel.)
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of controversy,'' Sperandio continues, ``and
eventually it was removed. We found it to be a failure of the
artist rather than the public. There was a gulf of understanding
between what he was doing and the people who were trying to enjoy
their lunch hour. It happened in '81, and had a big influence on
Simon and me. It showed us how not to be.''
</P>
<P>
   A little smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some teachers felt we were very reactionary.''
</P>
<P>
   The projects of Sperandio and Grennan have included
collaborating with chocolate workers on the design of a chocolate
bar wrapping (``We're kind of known in the art world for that''),
as well as a number of comic books, including ``Life in Prison,''
for which Sperandio interviewed his brother after his brother had
become ``drunk as a skunk'' &UR;  &LR; and landed in the county jail. There
are also a limited number of ``Invisible City'' comic books
available, free, from the Public Art Fund, which paid for the
project. The artists each got $2,000, which Sperandio estimates
comes to about 25 cents an hour, though he professes not to care.
</P>
<P>
   The people's art thing, again:
</P>
<P>
   ``Comics are good because so many people can get to the work.''
Final frames: The light is fading in the offices of the Public Art
Fund. Sperandio, after saying that he keeps his distance from the
New York art scene because it is ``a perilous place,'' is
explaining why it is so important to him to do good work.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father died the middle of my sophomore year in school. Lung
cancer. He smoked all his life. I had the opportunity to visit him
at the end, but I was getting my final portfolio together at
school.''
</P>
<P>
   Next frame:
</P>
<P>

That's really the motivating factor for me. I owe it to him to work

sacrificed seeing him for it.''

   AT&AMP;T AND MICROSOFT POISED TO TOWER OVER TECHNOLOGY
</P>
<P>
   Having cleared the way to become the nation's biggest cable
television company by acquiring Mediaone Group, AT&AMP;T moved closer
to a partnership with Microsoft. The whirlwind of deals surrounding
AT&AMP;T raised concerns in Washington and in many high-technology
quarters about the prospects for competition in the fast-growing
communications industry.
</P>
<P>
   With its cable and Microsoft deals, AT&AMP;T is poised to once again
stand astride the communications world. For Microsoft, a strong
relationship with AT&AMP;T could become the company's most important
vehicle for expanding from desktop computers into a new world in
which millions of consumers use seamless bundles of telephone,
television and high-speed Internet services.

   NATIONAL SEMICONDUCTOR TO SELL UNIT
</P>
<P>
   Less than two years after paying $550 million for Cyrix to enter
the personal computer microprocessor business, National
Semiconductor is exiting that market. National Semiconductor said
it would seek a buyer for the business as well as for its related
chip plant in South Portland, Me., and that it would cut 550 jobs,
or 4.8 percent of its work force, and take a charge of $250 million
to $300 million in the fourth quarter. Shares of National
Semiconductor rose $3.0625, to $17.6875.

   FIRST UNION SUED OVER 401(k) PLAN
</P>
<P>
   First Union, operator of the nation's sixth-largest bank, is
being sued by a group of former employees of Signet Bank, which
First Union acquired. They contend that First Union cost workers
millions of dollars by moving their 401(k) investments to First
Union mutual funds, none of which performed as well as the
investments they were removed from.

   MICROSOFT AMERICA ONLINE
</P>
<P>
   While taking a deposition in preparation for the next stage of
Microsoft's antitrust trial, a lawyer for the company tried to make
the case that America Online planned to use ``all of its marketing
muscle'' to promote its newly acquired product, the Netscape
Navigator Web browser. But an America Online executive disputed
that, saying the company thought ``the browser business is dead.''

   STOCKS RISE AS BLUE CHIPS RALLY
</P>
<P>
   Stocks rebounded as investors showed renewed affection for the
blue-chip growth stocks they had shunned lately. The Dow Jones
industrial average rose 69.30 points, or 0.64 percent, to
10,955.41. The Nasdaq composite index did even better, surging 1.98
percent, or 49.28 points, to 2.534.45. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index rose 15.31 points, or 1.15 percent, to 1,347.31.

   DEUTSCHE TELEKOM MAKES ITS CASE

   Deutsche Telekom and Telecom Italia began a series of investor
briefings to rally support for their $82 billion merger as new
signs of concern emerged. Deutsche Telekom's chief executive, Ron
Sommer, said he remained confident that financial institutions
would soon agree the deal made sense but that the two companies
would have to show they could improve efficiency.

   A YEAR 2000 PROGRESS REPORT

<P>
   The prevailing optimism that year 2000 computer problems will

   With a record 1.4 million personal bankruptcies filed in the

 Cereal Prices Creeping Back To Old Highs
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Rebecca Smith &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Snap, crackle, pop.
</P>
<P>
   That's the sound of the cereal business changing direction. This
time, it's coming amid cereal industry acceptance that it failed to
win back consumers by slashing prices as much as $1 a box from 1996
to 1997. All it got out of that ballyhooed price war was soggy
sales and bland profits.
</P>
<P>
   Now the industry is raising prices slightly _ Quaker Oats Co.
being the latest with a 2.5 percent price increase announced this
week after a 3 percent increase last month by General Mills _ and
is funneling the extra money into product development.
</P>
<P>
   The big push comes at a time when chains such as Safeway that
once were cereal industry partners now are competitors with
proprietary brands that are taking away market share. In addition,
consumers are gravitating toward other breakfast foods, like bagels
and muffins that they can eat on the run.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, the new focus is evident in the grocery cereal
aisle. Prices are creeping back up, although not to the level at
the peak four years ago, when many cereals approached $5 a box.
There is also an increase in coupon promotions, television
advertising and product innovation symbolized by the faster pace of
cereal rollouts.
</P>
<P>
   For example, rather than simply adding on to an existing brand
like Raisin Bran with Raisin Brand Crunch, Kellogg is expanding its
whole product line with completely new cereals.
</P>
<P>
   Kellogg has come out with Smart Start and Honey Crunch Flakes,
Post with Oreo O's and Waffle Crisp, and General Mills with
Sunrise. All were rolled out within the past year and are designed
to stave off imitators like Malt-O-Meal and Safeway, which have
positioned low-cost knockoff cereals to lure customers away from
the biggest brands.
</P>
<P>
   What the industry has learned, not surprisingly, is that the
best defense is a strong offense, food industry analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can only flank your major cereals with line extension so
many times before it begins to look tired,'' says food analyst
Lowell Singer at BancBoston Robertson Stephens in San Francisco.
``The strategy of extending lines and cutting prices clearly didn't
work because sales weren't growing.''
</P>
<P>
   Quaker Oats spokeswoman Karen Savinski agreed: ``We know that to
grow, we have to bring innovative new products to consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1993 to 1998, for example, grocery sales of cold cereal
fell from $8 billion to $6.9 billion and the number of boxes and
bags sold declined by roughly 200 million. Although some of that
business went to nongrocery competitors like Wal-Mart, industrywide
profits still were down.
</P>
<P>
   During that same period, Kellogg cut domestic cereal advertising
by an estimated 40 percent, noted food analyst John McMillin at
Prudential Securities in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Kellogg installed a new management team led by
Carlos Gutierrez. &LR;   &LR; The 45-year-old Cuban native says it is
imperative that Kellogg come up with innovative cereals that are
harder to copy and have the potential to build brand loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's leading a renaissance in product development,'' says
BancBoston's Singer. ``Part One is committing to new products. Part
Two is making sure they have the right products. That's what we're
watching for now.''
</P>
<P>
   Fruitful Squares, a heartier breakfast bar from Kellogg, is one
attempt to woo back younger consumers who grab food to eat on the
run. NutriGrain bars, another Kellogg product, didn't make it with
breakfasters because they weren't filling enough, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Amid criticism that many cereals have too many calories for the
nutritional benefit, the new cereals tout natural ingredients as
well as vitamin and mineral fortification. General Mills' Sunrise,
for example, says it is the first mass-marketed cereal made from
organically grown grains.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Kellogg is spending an estimated $20 million to
promote its ``K-sentials'' initiative to fortify some children's
cereals like Froot Loops and Apple Jacks with calcium and B
vitamins.
</P>
<P>
   And its advertising campaign for the newly introduced Raisin
Bran Crunch _ ``breakfast is back'' _ is designed for people who
don't think they have time for breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   In coming months, analysts expect Kellogg to roll out a new line
of Country Inn Specialty Cereals, intended to lure upscale shoppers
who think nothing of spending $5 for a Starbuck's latte and pastry.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're the cereal industry, you want people trading up to
higher-priced cereals instead of down to private labels,'' says
Prudential's McMillin in New York. ``That's what they're trying to
provide.''
</P>
<P>
   Kellogg intends to roll out its Country Inn cereals nationwide
this year. They're expected to sell for $4.49 a bag and are modeled
on cereals served at regional inns, including the Inn at Ormsby
Hill in Manchester, Vt.; Greyfield Inn at Cumberland Island, Ga.;
and the Green Gables Inn in Monterey.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the industry is trying to evoke the spirit of its
19th century founders, primarily dietary reformers like Charles W.
Post, John H. Kellogg and Sylvester Graham, who preached the health
benefits of whole grain cereals and graham crackers.
</P>
<P>
   Will this new campaign work? The industry is hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   For the first quarter of 1999, Kellogg reported sales up from
$1.64 billion to $1.75 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're been encouraged by what we've been seeing when we try to
broaden the cereal category,'' says Kellogg spokeswoman Chris Irvin
in Battle Creek, Mich. ``We're definitely reaching out more.''

WHITMAN AIDES IN PIQUE AT FIRST LADY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aides to Gov. Christie Whitman accused Hillary Rodham Clinton of
trying to avoid sharing the media limelight Wednesday during
ceremonies to greet Kosovar refugees as they arrived in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Peter McDonough, a spokesman for the governor, said that Whitman
had wanted to shake hands with the refugees as they got off a
chartered plane at McGuire Air Force Base. But McDonough said that
the first lady's office vetoed the idea, contending that it would
not be safe for Whitman to be so close to the refugees because many
of them were thought to be carrying tuberculosis or other
infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
   McDonough scoffed at that explanation, asserting that Mrs.
Clinton simply did not want to allow Whitman to be first in line
greeting the refugees at an event that was getting intense media
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how stupid they think we are to fall for such a
flimsy excuse,'' McDonough said. ``It's an extraordinarily
transparent bit of political jockeying by an apparent Senate
candidate in the state of New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is said to be thinking of running as a Democrat for
the U.S. Senate in New York next year. Whitman, a Republican, has
already said she plans to run for the Senate in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Mason, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Clinton, said, ``The first
lady was not involved in establishing how the refugees were greeted
when they arrived.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman eventually did get to shake hands with many of the
refugees as they disembarked from buses that had brought them from
the Air Force base to nearby Fort Dix, where they will be housed.
Mrs. Clinton also waited until the refugees got to Fort Dix to
greet them. She addressed the refugees inside a gymnasium, where
she was joined by the governor.
</P>
<P>
   After the event, Mrs. Clinton and Whitman exchanged niceties.
``She thanked the governor for being so helpful in setting up the
event,'' said Jayne O'Connor, a spokeswoman for Whitman.

A SPECIAL BRAND OF RESILIENCE ON DISPLAY IN OKLAHOMA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK MONTGOMERY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY _ A sunburned, crew-cut bulldog of a man clutches
a crate full of plastic bottles with attached nipples.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby stuff!'' he shouts above the commotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby stuff goes here,'' answers Elida Lopez, folding infant
sleepers under the noontime sun. She tapes a cardboard box closed
and says, ``I'm a housewife who just kind of showed up yesterday.
Today I'm heading up the baby department.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday across Oklahoma City _ a place seasoned by two very
different disasters within four years _ thousands of volunteers
such as Lopez were stacking, lifting, hauling, piling everything
imaginable into tractor-trailers destined for those who lost
everything imaginable in Monday's tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   Entire city blocks and parking lots were transformed into
charitable drop sites crammed elbow-to-elbow with folks who took
the day off work to help, then worked even harder than usual. Some
directed lines of traffic. Some wrenched their backs hoisting boxes
onto loading docks.
</P>
<P>
   Countless others simply donated what they had, like the
9-year-old girl who handed over $300 in cash that she'd been saving
to buy a bike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drinking straws! Got a load of drinking straws and cups!''
</P>
<P>
   At the Feed the Children drop site off Meridian Avenue, Shara
Hendrick, 21, had her own reasons for being here. She had been
enjoying an aerobics workout at a gym Monday night as the tornado
lurched toward the suburb of Moore; the aerobics instructor got
everybody into a vault that was once a restaurant cooler. Hendrick
thought she might die as the twister pounded over them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stepped out of that place and saw the whole area
devastated,'' she said Wednesday, loading bibs into a box. ``I just
feel so lucky. The windshield of my car (was) blown out, but that's
nothing when you think about all those who had everything they
owned turned to twigs.''
</P>
<P>
   So Hendrick and her mother skipped a day's pay from their jobs
at the state tourism department to help Wednesday in the relief
trenches.
</P>
<P>
   At Quail Springs Mall on the north side of Oklahoma City, dozens
waited in line to donate blood. At Crossroads Mall on the south
side, two trailers were packed with non-perishables. One woman
showed up Wednesday with a $100 bill she said she had found in a
gutter; she was certain it belonged to someone whose home was
destroyed miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Another person turned over a family album filled with pictures
of unknown people. She said she found it in her back yard.
</P>
<P>
   The Oklahoma College of Dentistry hauled in more than 1,000
toothbrushes and 1,000 rolls of floss. And at Pratt Discount Foods
on Northwest 39th Street, some shoppers paid for $150 worth of
groceries and then stacked every last sack into a giant donation
crate normally used for holding watermelons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We filled that crate in two hours,'' said check-out man David
Kimberlin.
</P>
<P>
   This response to a nationally publicized tragedy reminded
Oklahoma Citians of a similar blitz four years ago. The April 19,
1995, bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building killed 168
persons, leaving many parents childless and some children
parentless.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the relief agencies here learned from the bombing how
to coordinate things quickly,'' said Aaron Blaser, assignment
editor for a local CBS television affiliate, which sponsored a
drop-off site. ``During the bad weather Monday night, everyone was
just instinctively asking, `What do we need to do off the bat?' ''
</P>
<P>
   By dawn the next day, when the doors of a blood collection
agency opened in nearby Norman, a score of donors waited in parked
cars.
</P>
<P>
   And by Wednesday, volunteers by the thousands toted
walkie-talkies and fielded instructions at the Feed the Children
site, where forklifts criss-crossed semi-trailers criss-crossing
armored trucks bearing parcels of food.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what we call very organized chaos,'' said Duane Hunt,
a director of the local ministry that sponsors Feed the Children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Need some muscle power here! Got a forklift waiting!''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Price, a local youth pastor, said this disaster would take
longer to overcome than the 1995 bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you had more lives lost, but people still had their homes
and belongings. Now we've got _ what, 1,500 homes to rebuild?
That'll take a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's something about Oklahoma _ you still have this
remnant of the pioneer spirit,'' Price said. ``We've only been a
state since 1907. Some of the original homesteaders are still
alive. I think that helps cement this necessity of community.
Oklahoma City is probably the biggest small town in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   He taped another box down and a stranger carried it away to a
van.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say character is revealed in times of challenge, and
Oklahoma City has had its share,'' Price said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bleach! Got a box of bleach!''
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Gates was willing to take whatever she could get.
</P>
<P>
   She was shopping for her cousins _ Paul Olga and the Brinlee
brothers _ who were left homeless in Moore after the storm. She was
at the First Baptist Church, a command center for emergency crews
and a shelter and food kitchen for the estimated 300 families in
Moore whose homes were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Long tables sat in every hallway of the church to hold items
hauled in from the drop-off sites. Gates grabbed a tube of
deodorant, some shampoo and soap before moving to the tables of
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``My cousins, all they've got are the clothes on their backs,''
she says. ``They're out there right now going through the wreckage
wearing the same things they had on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're on the receiving end, you can't imagine how
important this is. And you really appreciate the work that went
into delivering this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   She reached into her shopping bag and pulled out a disposable
Bic razor, which retails for less than $1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even this,'' Gates said with a smile. ``Those boys have to
shave, you know.''

``BABY J.R. WENT FLYING ... AND THE HOUSE DISAPPEARED''
</HEADLINE>
 
EDS: Changes attribution in fifth graf to Richmond, sted Richland. (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JENNIFER AUTREY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIDWEST CITY, Okla. _ The neighborhood wouldn't know how the
Yonnes baby died if his 3-year-old sister hadn't been able to tell
the story.
</P>
<P>
   Her grandfather, John Richmond, said little Josephine Yonnes
riveted nurses and doctors at the hospital Monday night as she told
how she climbed into a bathtub with her mother, father, twin
brother and four-month-old baby brother as a tornado roared toward
their house on Will Rogers Road.
</P>
<P>
   ```The big storm came and the house came open. Baby J.R. went
flying and Momma went flying and the house disappeared,' ''
Richmond said Josephine told him.
</P>
<P>
   A baby was found dead in the adjacent yard. The medical
examiner's confirmation hadn't come in Wednesday, but Richmond said
he knows it will be his grandson, Jeffery ``J.R.'' Yonnes Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The baby's mother, LaManda Kelly, 24, is in critical condition
at Presbyterian Hospital and hasn't been told about her baby's
fate. His father, Jeff Yonnes, remembers nothing of the storm. And
3-year-old twin Jeremy hasn't spoken, Richmond said.
</P>
<P>
   So it was Josephine, through her grandfather, who helped the
Will Rogers Road residents piece together what happened to each of
them after their 5700 block suffered some of the worst damage from
Monday night's storms.
</P>
<P>
   Including the baby, all four confirmed fatalities in Midwest
City were found on their street. The bodies were so badly mangled
that for a while authorities mistakenly counted one woman's body as
two, said Lt. Gerald Beabout, Midwest City Police Department public
information officer. The victims' names hadn't been released late
Wednesday because next of kin hadn't been contacted.
</P>
<P>
   Will Rogers Road is bordered by busy Sooner Road to the west and
a small through-street, Center Drive, on the east. It is just south
of 15th Street, where dozens of businesses were obliterated. The
200-member Sooner Baptist Church on the northeast corner of the
block and the Peter Pan Small World day care across from it were
the only buildings left standing.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday was the first day that most residents were able to
return, looking for mementos among the rubble and discussing the
week's events with each other.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the one-story wood houses were rental properties and the
neighbors knew each other more by sight than by name. But they were
concerned about their neighbors. Rumors were rife. Many mistakenly
thought Kelly had been killed along with all the children in the
neighboring York house.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yorks are OK?'' said Dewey Young, 54, who lives down the
street. ``No way. We thought they were all dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Young drove his pickup 80 mph to a friend's storm cellar as the
tornado chased him and his wife, Leona, up Sooner Road. They
returned Wednesday to find only the four bathroom walls and a
kitchen counter with two unbruised bananas.
</P>
<P>
   The York family lived beside the church, where the children
loved to play even if they attended irregularly. Sooner Baptist
youth minister Deric Brock had been checking on the family. He was
able to tell neighbors yesterday that Tierra York, 8, was expected
to have permanent vision loss. Doctors had removed the two-by-four
embedded in the back of Justin York, 5, to leave no spinal damage.
Jacob York, 18 months, would also live.
</P>
<P>
   Brock said the Yorks' father, David Sean, 30, covered his
children as they lay in the bathtub. The next thing he remembers,
he was lying on concrete, the bathtub was gone, and the children
were scattered across fields of debris, Brock said.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor from across the street, Dave Dimick, 37, said he took
the York children to a hospital. Minutes later, Susan York came
home to find her family gone. Fearing the worst, she screamed their
names in despair, Brock said.
</P>
<P>
   Dimick had escaped uninjured. He had watched television until
the tornado was at Interstate 240 and Sooner Road. Knowing his home
was just north of Interstate 40 and Sooner, Dimick grabbed a
Hershey's with almonds, a Walkman radio and a metal chair and
opened a manhole in front a neighbor's house.
</P>
<P>
   He climbed in, stood on the chair in the nine-foot-deep manhole
and held the lid until it blew away. Then he crouched in the chair
until the storm blew by.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street, Evelyn Blanton, 82, rode the tornado like a
bucking bronco as it picked her up in her Ford LTD, spun her and
her puppies three times, then set the car down in a ditch. Blanton
was unscathed but her house was gone, said her niece, Gina Hulsey.
</P>
<P>
   Cecil Hawkins bore the brunt of the storm outside. He had a
storm cellar but waited until he heard the tornado coming before
trying to take the padlock off. His wife had died in an accident in
the cellar last year, and his son, Tim Hawkins of suburban Dallas,
suspected that his father was reluctant to go in.

COMMENTARY: UPTOWN, ACROSS TOWN, OUT OF TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By VERLYN KLINKENBORG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the stage, theatricality means a fullness of effect, a
knowing use of all the theater's dimensions, an awareness of how
the right staging can ionize the very air an audience breathes. But
a city's theatricality _ who conspires to produce that? New York
rises above its crowded streets, a consolidated chaos of views, and
the power of its scenic accidents is so great that they look
purposeful, every last one of them, until you realize that only the
eye's intent unites them.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, as you cut across town on everyday business,
New York's inherent theatricality seems to array itself before you
with unusual economy, the grandness of the staging almost mocking
the plainness of your business. You catch a morning cab to La
Guardia, for instance, and instead of stiffing it out in midtown
traffic, the driver bears north through Central Park on East Drive,
edging upward along Madison Avenue, across 116th Street and finally
onto the Triborough Bridge. In spring this is an inspired choice of
routes, and the driver, gesturing at trees that will soon form a
tunnel of green overhead, knows it.
</P>
<P>
   The park, of course, is one of the places where the striving for
theatricality is evident, where a single design makes the city
cohere around it. After the streets of midtown, so full of ardor
and self-absorption, the park feels truly public, even though most
people go there to serve private ends, to walk or run or skate or
perambulate the children, to lie beside a magnolia dropping its
petals, to reinvigorate their sense of where they are. But the same
feeling emerges in the vicinity of community gardens built on
once-vacant lots in the blocks of Madison Avenue near 112th Street.
Those gardens are shrines to green space, and though they organize
less territory than Central Park does, they help define the
theatricality of the streets that surround them, which contain so
much of what is public in that neighborhood's life.
</P>
<P>
   The shop-windows clamor in this part of town, windows full of
cakes and second-story wedding gowns, windows gilded with neon and
crammed with half a store's stock, windows empty except for the
relics of a former business. When the cab catches the Triborough
on-ramp, the city seems to revolve beneath you until it integrates
these low rooftops with the taller buildings that lie beyond them.
The river runs slowly downtown past the East Side's long flank. And
all this theater lies threaded along the path of a single cab ride
_ the blaring chaos of midtown, the almost concupiscent pleasures
of Central Park in spring, the vivid promptings and urgings of East
Harlem. It seems forgivable, as you cross into Queens, to believe
that it was arranged this way just for you. After all, tomorrow you
will be an extra in someone else's epiphany.

EDITORIAL: AT&AMP;T GROWS LARGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Thursday, May 6: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three decades after AT&AMP;T was forced by antitrust laws to
give up its most vital asset _ ownership of a wire into most
American homes _ the company is trying to regain that access by a
different means. Now it hopes to use the cable television wire into
your home to get your telephone business.
</P>
<P>
   The latest deals negotiated by AT&AMP;T, including the purchase of
Mediaone, a cable company, and a series of transactions involving
Comcast, a cable company that had wanted to buy Mediaone, mean that
AT&AMP;T will be in a position to offer local phone service to most
American homes.
</P>
<P>
   C. Michael Armstrong, who has been running AT&AMP;T for 18 months,
has now committed to spend $112 billion to buy cable systems that
are positioned to connect to about a quarter of the homes in
America. In addition the company has tentative agreements with
other cable operators, including Comcast and Time Warner, to offer
AT&AMP;T-branded local phone service through cable systems to another
quarter of America. At the moment no homes get such cable-phone
service from AT&AMP;T, although AT&AMP;T says it will begin offering the
service in several communities around the country later this year,
with a broader availability next year.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether AT&AMP;T's huge investment in the area
will prove to be a brilliant business move or as disastrous as its
ill-fated effort in the 1980s to become a computer company after it
was forced by an antitrust settlement to spin off its local
telephone operations. But the venture is to be welcomed because it
holds out the possibility of real competition for local phone
service for millions of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The role of Microsoft in the cable deals may need further study.
Microsoft owns a substantial stake in Comcast _ bought about three
years ago when cable stock prices were depressed _ and had talked
to Comcast about helping to finance its bid for Mediaone. Now it is
reported to be considering making an investment in AT&AMP;T in return
for an agreement that a version of Microsoft's Windows operating
system will be used in the cable boxes that will be providing a
growing range of services.
</P>
<P>
   Any such arrangement should be scrutinized to make sure that it
does not provide a new monopoly area for Microsoft in one of the
businesses _ Internet access via cable television _ where
competitive positions have yet to be sorted out. There is nothing
wrong with Microsoft's gaining a dominant position because it
offers a superior product, but such dominance should not result
from the financial clout that the company now has.

CALIFORNIA COLLEGE STUDENTS FACE EXPULSION IF THEY DON'T MEASURE
UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ROBERT MONROE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHRIDGE, Calif. -- Some 1,100 freshmen at CSUN must pass
remedial math and English classes by summer's end or risk expulsion
under a controversial policy used for the first time, officials
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Students who fail the courses in the semester ending this month
have another chance in summer school, and officials expect most to
pass. Students who do not pass by the fall enrollment period can
ask for a waiver or will be expelled.
</P>
<P>
   The policy provoked a protest Wednesday by 150 students who
claim they are being punished for the shortcomings of their high
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're in high school and you didn't get math and English,
that's not on the student; that's on the education system,'' said
Tameika Hall, a 23-year-old junior who led the protest.
</P>
<P>
   The policy, which affects all California State University
campuses, was adopted in 1996 to ensure the qualifications of
incoming students. About half the system's 28,000 freshmen had to
take remedial courses this school year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that a high percentage of students were not prepared
for university work,'' said Ken Swisher, spokesman for the CSU
Chancellor's Office.
</P>
<P>
   He could not say how many students systemwide had yet to pass
the courses.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty percent of CSUN's 2,268 incoming freshmen didn't have to
take remedial classes because they passed a test or excelled in
high school. Of the remaining 1,822 students, more than 500 took
and passed remedial classes so far this year. That leaves some
1,100 who must take the classes for the first time or repeat them
because they failed.
</P>
<P>
   University spokesman John Chandler could not specify how many of
the 1,100 students had taken the classes and failed. But he said he
had heard estimates from administrators that 75 percent passed
English classes and fewer passed math.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a cakewalk,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The policy, known as Executive Order 665, gives freshmen and
transfer students three chances -- fall, spring and summer
semesters -- to pass the remedial courses. If they still have not
passed by the last try, they are expelled until they have passed
transferable freshman math or English courses elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The number of freshmen needing remedial classes leveled off this
school year after years of steady increase, Swisher said.
</P>
<P>
   At California State University, Long Beach, which enrolled 2,806
freshmen last fall, 797 still must pass math and 445 must pass
English, said spokesman Rick Gloady.
</P>
<P>
   Even above-average high school students have had to take
remedial classes. Of all CSU freshmen in remedial math classes, the
mean grade-point average in high school was 3.16, Swisher said.
</P>
<P>
   Executive Order 665 includes a mentoring program for high school
students and an effort by the CSU system to identify which high
schools send the most underqualified students, he said.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN students showered their outrage on administrators
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked so hard to get here. I don't think that's right to
eliminate the students,'' said freshman Jimira Smith, 19, who plans
to major in physical therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who failed one of two math remediation classes she was
required to take last fall, said she passed her calculus class at
Pacific Palisades High School but admits she doesn't grasp math
well.
</P>
<P>
   Students in Monica Turner's public speaking class organized the
protest forum on the rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd really hate to see this revert to the days of slavery when
slaves had to teach themselves how to read and write,'' Turner
said. ``This is a blame-the-victim policy.''

BOY PUNISHED FOR REPORTING DRUGS TO PARENTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PATRICIA FARRELL AIDEM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAUGUS, Calif. -- Tyler Hagen tried to do the right thing when a
friend asked him to get rid of a small bag of marijuana he had
bought just to be ``cool.''
</P>
<P>
   The seventh-grader turned it over to his parents, who did the
right thing by calling the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
</P>
<P>
   But the doing the right thing went wrong when school authorities
were informed. The 13-year-old was suspended under the school
district's ``zero-tolerance'' policy -- leaving the boy upset, his
parents furious and the Sheriff's Department flabbergasted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose the real right thing would have been to take it to
the school office, but they're kids and they won't do that,''
Sheriff's Sgt. Lee White said Wednesday. ``So he took it to his
parents. He did the other right thing. That should count.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the 13-year-old's parents -- with White's support -- are
fighting for their son's return to Arroyo Seco Junior High School
in the Santa Clarita Valley north of metropolitan Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should he have lied?'' said Tyler's mother, Linda Hagen.
``Here we are, trying to tell our kids to come forward and talk to
us, but what happens? He gets in trouble. He gets the same
punishment as the kids who are pushing drugs at school.''
</P>
<P>
   But officials with the William S. Hart Union High School
District said the 13-year-old was punished for taking possession of
the marijuana on campus and bringing it home to his parents rather
than turning it over to the principal.
</P>
<P>
   Arroyo Seco Principal Jackie Snyder did not return telephone
calls. And Michael Almandinger, assistant superintendent of student
services for the Hart District, would not comment on the specifics
of Tyler's case, but cited district policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If kids are in possession of drugs at school, our board has
taken a `zero-tolerance' stand,'' Almandinger said. ``The
principals are directed to bring forth a student for expulsion
unless they find circumstances that make them think expulsion is
not appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyler's options now are to enter a special class at Arroyo Seco
for kids in trouble -- which his parents refuse to allow -- or to
enroll in another local junior high.
</P>
<P>
   According to White, a friend of Tyler's was taunted April 29 by
peers at Santa Clarita's Skate Park, until he finally agreed to buy
a ``dime bag'' of marijuana at school the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid felt he was pressured,'' said White, the chief
juvenile crime investigator in Santa Clarita. ``He bought it to be
cool, but then he didn't know how to get rid of it. He gave it to a
friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyler was talking over the situation with his friends --
unidentified because they are juveniles -- as they waited by Arroyo
Seco's flag pole for their ride home, Linda Hagen said.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler wanted to help, so he took the plastic bag of marijuana
with him. He then confided in his parents, and gave them the bag
containing a half-teaspoon of marijuana, Hagen said.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's father, Chris Hagen, called the sheriff's station and
their son and the other boys were interviewed by school officials
Monday, the day that Tyler's suspension took effect.
</P>
<P>
   White supports the district's get-tough policy, but said Tyler
Hagen seems to be an exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there should be some consideration if he went to his
parents,'' White said. ``That's what we try to teach these kids: Go
to your parents. Talk to them. Talk to someone. We want kids to
report these things.''

UCLA DEFENSE PUTS ON STRONG CASE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Back when spring was winter, before balls
fluttered around Spaulding Field, UCLA defensive lineman Pete
Holland set his goals for spring practice.
</P>
<P>
   A history major who quotes Thurgood Marshall, Holland kept it
simple: The defense needed to regain the respect of UCLA's
offensive players and the coaching staff. Yielding 87 points in the
two most important games of the season (Miami, Wisconsin) has a way
of causing concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we were divided,'' said Holland, who was chosen
defensive captain for the 1999 season. ``It was no secret the
defense was the weak point. We needed to win the offense's respect
back during the spring. That was vital to the team's morale, and I
think we did that.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense left no doubt Saturday, holding the offense to two
touchdowns and a field goal in a 70-play scrimmage. Granted, Cade
McNown wasn't directing the attack, and the best receivers were on
the sideline. But for the first time since the USC game, the
defense had a presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pleased,'' coach Bob Toledo said. ``They got a lot of
pressure, and obviously they covered pretty good.... We had better
pad level. Better gap control. We covered better. We tackled
better.''
</P>
<P>
   All true. But three months before training camp, plenty of
questions remain _ on both sides of the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback: After four weeks and no answers, the question is
not only who, but when. Will Toledo wait until the Sept. 4 opener
(Boise State) to name a starter? Will the Bruins rotate
quarterbacks?
</P>
<P>
   That junior Drew Bennett didn't win the job in April indicates
he may never win it. After all, his massive edge in experience will
diminish over time.
</P>
<P>
   In several scrimmages, the Bruins responded best to freshman
Cory Paus, who vaulted to second string on the depth chart. Both
Scott McEwan (early) and Ryan McCann (late) had their moments, but
neither matched Bennett or Paus for playmaking.
</P>
<P>
   As for rookie J.P. Losman, two things are evident: He has the
best arm, and he has much to learn. Perhaps the spring experience
will catapult Losman to a terrific training camp. More likely,
though, he'll spend 1999 as a redshirt.
</P>
<P>
   Running back: The Bruins are loaded in the backfield. DeShaun
Foster, bigger and faster, is the best third-string tailback in the
nation. Jermaine Lewis and Keith Brown were solid as well, and
watch for a big season from fullback Durell Price. His role will
expand in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Receiver: Another loaded position, although injuries (Freddie
Mitchell, Brian Poli-Dixon) and a volleyball commitment (Danny
Farmer) limited this unit.
</P>
<P>
   Gabe Crecion made good use of his redshirt season. He looked
stronger and more confident and should be the starting tight end
when training camp opens. Randy Hakes, Bryan Fletcher and incoming
freshman Mike Seidman make tight end one of UCLA's deepest
positions.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive line: What's left of it is young but talented. Since
last season, the Bruins have lost seven players to attrition,
injury or position change.
</P>
<P>
   The stories of the spring were freshmen Mike Saffer (right
guard) and Blake Worley (left tackle), who won starting jobs in the
spots previously occupied by Andy Meyers and Kris Farris,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Reserves Josh (shoulder) and Micah (knee) Webb missed spring
practice but are expected back for training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive line: First-year assistant coaches Jethro Franklin
(tackles) and John Pearce (ends) were relentless. At Toledo's
request, they turned spring practice into boot camp, toughening the
young linemen, forcing them to disregard fatigue and play through
minor aches and pains.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaches really tightened the screws on the front line,''
Holland said. ``It was great.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest mover and sacker was freshman Rusty Williams, the
high-energy weakside end from San Diego. He vaulted into the
starting spot vacated by Santi Hall, who was suspended for
violating team rules and might not return.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Sean Phillips moved from tackle to strongside end
behind Kenyon Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Kocher, Anthony Fletcher, converted offensive lineman Steve
Morgan and Holland will rotate at tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker: The injury-induced retirements of Mike Wiley and
Ramogi Huma have left UCLA so thin at linebacker that incoming
freshman Marcus Reese could play immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans Ryan Nece (weak side) and Tony White (middle) adjusted
quickly to the new 4-3 alignment, but the Robert Thomas situation
was not resolved. (He's listed as the No.2 middle linebacker.) One
option is to move Thomas or White outside, to Brendon Ayanbadejo's
former position.
</P>
<P>
   Secondary: Long a problem position, cornerback is now the
strength of the defensive backfield. Jason Bell (heel) did not
practice but is slotted to start. Marques Anderson played with a
passion he usually reserves for USC, and freshman Joe Hunter was
impressive.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Ryan Roques has moved from cornerback to free safety,
since neither Eric Whitfield nor Audie Attar played well. Jason
Stephens is No.1 at strong safety.
</P>
<P>
   Special teams: With Foster, Lewis, Mitchell and Roques, the
Bruins have their most talented group of returners in years.
Although walk-on Chris Griffith kicked well, both the punting and
kicking positions are wide open.

CALIFORNIA COLLEGE STUDENTS FACE EXPULSION IF THEY DON'T MEASURE

   NORTHRIDGE, Calif. -- Some 1,100 freshmen at California State

<P>
   Students in Monica Turner's public speaking class organized the
protest forum on the rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd really hate to see this revert to the days of slavery when
slaves had to teach themselves how to read and write,'' Turner
said. ``This is a blame-the-victim policy.''

IN AFTERMATH OF WICHITA TORNADO, MAMMOTH RECOVERY EFFORT UNFOLDS

   WICHITA, Kan. _ Truckload by truckload Wednesday, residents of
Sedgwick County continued the tedious job of digging out and
clearing away the tons of debris left in the wake of Monday night's
twister, which ripped through the center of suburban Haysville,
then shredded two mobile home parks in south Wichita.
</P>
<P>
   Residents began to reckon with the emotional costs of burying
five of their dead, along with the physical toll imposed on more
than 150 persons who needed medical treatment for injuries, and
property damage already estimated at near $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   All over Wichita, equipment rental outlets reported a run on
generators, chain saws, tractors and boom lifts. And along a broad
front, relief was pouring into the area:
</P>
<P>
   - Federal and state officials, including Gov. Bill Graves and
James Lee Witt, director of the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, were in the area to review the damage and vow support.
Other cities in Kansas, including Lenexa, Lawrence and Overland
Park, either had public works crews on the scene or on the way to
Wichita.
</P>
<P>
   - An army of insurance agents swept into the area to begin
processing thousands of claims that will be filed. Initial
estimates of damage in Sedgwick County were approaching $150
million. Preliminary counts indicated that 8,480 homes and
businesses had been damaged; 1,129 of those were destroyed. Major
damage was inflicted on 2,245 buildings, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   - Mental-health counselors and religious ministers were meeting
with residents devastated by the storm, offering emotional support,
as well.
</P>
<P>
   The search for the missing has ended, and everyone had been
accounted for within 48 hours of the storm, said Ken Cox, Sedgwick
County battalion fire chief. He credited Haysville's tornado
sirens, in particular, with giving residents time to seek shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had it not been for the early warning we would have had a lot
more loss of life,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore was expected to arrive today to tour the
region, which President Clinton has already declared a federal
disaster area. Graves and the federal agency's Witt pledged
financial support to those who lost homes and businesses, and to
make the cleanup process as smooth and swift as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need to do is keep the anger and frustration level
down, because they (victims) have been through enough,'' Witt said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the governmental response, insurance claims
adjusters fanned out over the area to view damage and write checks.
Allstate Insurance brought in adjusters from around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Farm Bureau Insurance has a satellite office in south Wichita
about a mile from the tornado-ravaged area. A steady stream of
people called or came in to that office, which has become a center
for the company's claims activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's a total loss and they need money for clothing or even
a toothbrush, they can come here and we'll cut them a check,'' said
Terrie Enslinger, an insurance underwriter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had people coming in with just the clothes on their back,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Enslinger said many people just coped with the shock Tuesday and
waited until Wednesday to contact their insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   State Farm Insurance Cos., the largest insurer of homes and
autos in Kansas, estimated that at least 3,500 homeowners suffered
$14 million in losses and that 300 vehicle owners suffered $450,000
in damages in the Haysville and Wichita areas.
</P>
<P>
   State Farm has set up a claim contact center in the area and
established a toll-free hot line at (800) SF-CLAIM for policy
holders who cannot reach agents directly, said Doug Eaton, the
company's Oklahoma-Kansas regional vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers Insurance Group, another large insurer, estimated it
would receive at least 4,000 claims from homeowners and 2,400 from
vehicle owners in Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas, which also was hit.
More than half are expected to come from Oklahoma; about 900 Kansas
property damage claims and 250 Kansas auto claims are included in
the total.
</P>
<P>
   Damage was not confined to the tornado's path. Fallen tree limbs
littered yards in many neighborhoods in south Wichita.
</P>
<P>
   The tree limb problem was so extensive, Wichita public works
officials still hadn't been able to come up with a strategy
Wednesday to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   Kristin Peck, a spokeswoman for the city of Wichita, said it
will take the area a long time to recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take months to just get things cleaned up,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Haysville said hundreds of volunteers were coming
to the community activity center near the Kansas Turnpike entrance
to help in the massive cleanup. They were advising everyone to
bring heavy gloves. Crews were still trying to restore power there.
</P>
<P>
   Among the volunteers were city crews from Lenexa and Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   The Lenexa Public Works Department dispatched a crew of 12 to
Wichita on Tuesday to assist with the cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the city business, everybody tries to help everybody if we
can,'' said Dennis Banka, Lenexa's public works manager. ``It can
happen to us just as easily as it happened to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Overland Park has a team of six vehicles and seven employees
they will send as soon as Wichita makes the request, said Bob
Lowry, the city's public works director.

VICTIMS COPE WITH AFTERMATH OF WICHITA AREA TORNADO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM PERRIN, JIM SULLINGER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star

<P>
   WICHITA, Kan. _ Amid the prayers of thanks for keepsakes
recovered and the muffled curses over personal losses, the
collective shock that many in the Wichita area felt the morning
after Monday night's tornado was giving way Wednesday to a more
ominous feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's plenty of people supporting us,'' said Tim Norton, the
mayor of Haysville, a city of 9,500 that abuts Wichita's southern
border. ``We're being ministered to, but three months from now _
when we wake up and our whole town is still gutted and there aren't
a lot of people supporting us and helping us clean up _ we're going
to go through a grieving process and have to come to terms with
this.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there was plenty of immediate grief to go around.
But devastation notwithstanding, there were lighter moments, as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Leanora Smith wasn't able to salvage much more than a few
clothes and toys from the wreckage of her mobile home, but there
was a bright spot Wednesday for her boyfriend, Matt Lathrom.
</P>
<P>
   Buried in the rubble at Lakeshore Mobile Home Park was Lathrom's
prized 1975 Harley-Davidson motorcycle. It took three hours and a
gasoline-powered saw to cut through the debris, but Lathrom and a
couple of friends were able to extract the motorcycle he finished
restoring a year ago, at a cost of $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a Harley rider, that's about as important as life,''
Lathrom said. ``I was just glad I found it.''
</P>
<P>
   The circumstances may have tempered his joy. But it was a moment
of something other than the scenes of grief, desperation and
helplessness that were playing for block after block in south
Wichita and nearby Haysville as the cleanup continued.
</P>
<P>
   Many people, knee-deep in rubble, had their minds occupied with
competing concerns: retreiving what they could from their previous
homes; wondering where they would make their next ones.
</P>
<P>
   Lavenia Martin, though, set about the task with greater focus.
As family members helped salvage belongings from what was left of
her mobile home Wednesday morning, she was looking ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Even though her home at the Lakeshore park was destroyed,
Martin, 71, remained set in her ways. Once the insurance comes
through, she and her husband, Harold, 75, plan to buy another
mobile home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did make the remark that it seems tornadoes target mobile
home parks, but it never occurred to me not to get another one,''
said Lavenia Martin, who had lived in the mobile home since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Others were having a harder time figuring out where to turn.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Meredith, a chaplain and crisis counselor at Wesley
Medical Center in Wichita, talked with victims at one of the
trailer parks.
</P>
<P>
   She said they felt powerless and helpless, looking through the
wreckage of for pictures _ ``visual clues to their identity.''
</P>
<P>
   A few took photographs or videos of their damaged property.
</P>
<P>
   Still dazed, others were not sure what to do next. Meredith said
even a little direction from someone was enough to jump-start
thoughts about the future.
</P>
<P>
   She said many victims, especially children, will feel a
heightened sense of anxiety and loss of security as the days and
weeks go by.
</P>
<P>
   Many will depend on charity, she added, and that could be hard
for some.
</P>
<P>
   Meredith said people who were trapped in the rubble and waited
in the dark for rescue will have nightmares and flashbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a difficult adjustment,'' she said. ``Kids who are going
to school will get a lot of support. That will help.''
</P>
<P>
   In future storms, they will exhibit a heightened state of alarm,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Haysville, Linda and Shawn Langhover estimate they've had
help from 30 friends and family members in cleaning up the remains
of their home. The bright spots Wednesday were the recovery of
Linda Langhover's wedding ring and her husband's Masonic ring.
</P>
<P>
   However, they were able to recover only half of their
13-year-old son's 100 wrestling medals.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of blocks away, Michelle and Edward Coldiron had the
opportunity to speak with federal and state officials who brought
promises of aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps reassure us that some action will be taken, that it
won't just be overlooked,'' Michelle Coldiron said.
</P>
<P>
   Like other victims, the Coldirons coped by keeping their sense
of humor. Using white spray paint, Edward Coldiron sprayed ``For
Sale'' signs on the remains of their house.
</P>
<P>
   Among those sifting debris, searching for the proper perspective
on the death and destruction, was Calvin Waters, a sheet metal
worker whose home was damaged by the tornado. He spent a second day
trying to clear the wreckage, patch holes in the roof and mop up
water damage.
</P>
<P>
   He called himself fortunate, saying such things can be replaced.
But he was especially shaken by the deaths of a woman and
1-month-old baby near his home, even though he did not know them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always think a child should get a chance to grow up,'' he
said. ``If you have to take two people, don't take a baby child.
Take me: I'm 44 years old.''

RUMORS OF VIOLENCE PROMPT WAVE OF STUDENT ABSENCES AROUND L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY LISA VAN PROYEN AND GREG GITTRICH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Rumors of racially motivated violence at suburban
San Fernando Valley schools led thousands of students to stay home
Wednesday, as police beefed up patrols and campuses braced for more
absences today.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to schools districtwide today, Los Angeles Unified
School District Superintendent Ruben Zacarias urged parents to
return their children to school and alert authorities with concrete
information about threats or impending violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He encouraged parents and community members to contact their
local schools or police departments if they have specific concerns
about safety issues, rather than allowing youngsters to use
generalized and unverified threats or rumors as a reason to stay
out of school,'' said LAUSD spokesman Brad Sales.
</P>
<P>
   Among the hardest hit campuses was Chatsworth High School, about
35 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles, where more than half
the 3,200 students stayed home. Several principals planned parent
meetings and assemblies, while stepping up checks of students with
metal detectors.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they are continuing additional patrols until rumors
subside, and they are working to track down the sources of the
false reports.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles police detectives questioned several North Hollywood
students including one who acknowledged he had joked about wanting
to bomb a school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've told them that perhaps they're sorry, but if it happens
again they can be arrested and prosecuted,'' said Detective George
Armenta of the North Hollywood Division.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're also notifying principals that they should advise their
students that pranks can't be taken lightly,'' Armenta said.
</P>
<P>
   Today at a meeting of the school safety committee, school board
member Julie Korenstein plans to introduce a resolution to bring
criminal and civil charges against students caught making terrorist
threats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students should realize that if they do this they will be
arrested by the LAPD and expelled from L.A. Unified,'' Korenstein
said. ``These threats have been very contagious. They really think
that it's funny and it's not.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Unified School District officials said the rumors
and fear were sparked largely by the school shootings in Littleton,
Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's tensions in the community and in the whole country
because of the Littleton incidents. To think that schools are
immune from that tension is Pollyanish,'' said Shel Erlich, a
district spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Several San Fernando Valley schools reported drastically low
attendance figures, including at Chatsworth High School, where
1,883 of the 3,200 students were absent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen this large number of students out of school,''
said Vice Principal Greg Lee. ``It's just the anxiety that the
students and the parents have.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior Anthony Muzichenko, 18, said he didn't believe the
rumors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is just childish,'' he said, adding that he understood why
his classmates stayed home. ``Nobody wants to take chances after
the Colorado shootings.''
</P>
<P>
   At Lawrence Middle School in Chatsworth, 28 percent of the
student body was absent.
</P>
<P>
   At North Hollywood High School, a bomb threat on Wednesday
proved false. ``We've been receiving an increased number of bomb
threats that are made. I'm sure it has to do with the incidents in
Colorado,'' said LAUSD Assistant Police Chief Richard Page.
</P>
<P>
   At Monroe High School in suburban North Hills in the San
Fernando Valley, counselors, deans and teachers increased their
routine metal detecting and backpack searches on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The disruptions Wednesday follow a series of rumors that began
after the Colorado shootings April 20.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest round, students and teachers at Valley schools
told police and school officials they heard about plans by Latino
youths to shoot white students.
</P>
<P>
   Students reported that the rumor appeared on the Internet, but
police could not confirm that report.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where that came from, but I know lots of people
are nervous, and there's a heightened awareness to possible
threats,'' said Gerald Kleinman, principal at Birmingham High
School in Van Nuys, where student attendance also was slightly
down.
</P>
<P>
   Louisa Miranda, a mother of a Chatsworth High School sophomore,
was not about to take chances with her son, Andy. She drove him to
school but only to attend the lunchtime Cinco de Mayo festivities
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard that there were going to be a lot of things
happening. I didn't want him to come to school,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on Wednesday, a 15-year-old student was arrested
Wednesday at Narbonne High School in Harbor City after allegedly
planting a fake bomb outside the cafeteria, said LAPD Lt. Anthony
Alba. He was arrested on suspicion of having a fake bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, a 15-year-old boy at the same school was
questioned for allegedly making a false bomb threat and telling
several students that ``he could blow up the school by using his
personal computer,'' Alba said.

BREAKING A TABOO, PENNSYLVANIA WILL OFFER STIPENDS FOR ORGAN
DONATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: LEADS with four grafs to raise role of governor's advisory
panel, add details, background on panel and how plan wouldbe
implemented; Spelling of Emilie in 4th graf cq.) 
 (rm) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With demand for human organs far outstripping
supply and more than 64,000 Americans waiting to receive new
hearts, lungs, livers, pancreases and kidneys, Pennsylvania is
taking steps to become the first state to break a long-held taboo
against providing a financial reward for organ donation.
</P>
<P>
   By early next year, state health officials said this week, they
will begin offering a stipend of about $300 to help families of
organ donors cover their funeral expenses. The stipend, authorized
by a 1994 law, will be paid to funeral homes and not directly to
relatives under a pilot project that will be monitored for three
years by a panel of medical ethicists to see if it increases organ
donations.
</P>
<P>
   Final details of the project are being worked out by a panel of
advisers to Gov. Tom Ridge, a Republican. The panel is expected to
issue its recommendations on June 9. A spokesman for the governor
said he knew of ``no impediment'' to the plan. If Ridge approves
the program, the state Health Department will sign contracts with
Pennsylvania's two organ procurement agencies to begin making the
payments as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all ready to move forward,'' said Emilie Tierney, the
state health official supervising the project. ``We expect other
states to be watching us.''
</P>
<P>
   Also watching is the federal government, which says the payments
may violate the National Organ Transplant Act, a 1984 law that
classifies human organs as a national resource and prohibits their
sale. And the plan is generating intense debate among transplant
surgeons, organ recipients and families of past donors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is absolutely not buying and selling organs,'' said
Howard Nathan, who serves on the governor's advisory panel and is
president of the Gift of Life Donor Program, one of two regional
networks that distribute donated organs in Pennsylvania. ``This is
about having a voluntary death benefit for a family who gave a
gift. The intent is to test it and see if it makes a difference to
families.''
</P>
<P>
   But the federal Health Resources and Services Administration,
which oversees the nation's transplant programs, is not so certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal statute is fairly clear in prohibiting the
exchange of organs for any kind of payment,'' said Jon Nelson, who
directs the agency's office of special programs. ``The question is
whether this is in violation of the statute or not. Clearly, we
have to look at it closely.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the payments are legal, critics say they raise
questions: Will the promise of a stipend, however small, induce
families to lie about the medical histories of their loved ones,
withholding information that could affect the health of the
transplant recipient?
</P>
<P>
   Will the money prompt a disproportionate increase in donation
among the poor, injecting further economic imbalance into a system
that is already skewed in favor of the wealthy? Will the plan
backfire, hindering organ donation by offending families who
believe their gift is tainted by payments?
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, in an era when surgeons are routinely
transplanting kidneys from living donors who are not related to the
recipients, could the stipends mark the first step on the road
toward outright sale of organs?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is very murky ground to get into when we put a
monetary incentive for such an altruistic gift as organ donation,''
said Antonio Benedi, a liver recipient and past president of
Transplant Recipients' International Organization, a nonprofit
group in Washington. ``Obviously there are some folks that need
help as far as funerals go, but to attach it to the actual
donation, I think, is very dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Some transplant surgeons echo his view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Society is not prepared to allow for your body to be bought
and sold,'' said Dr. Francis L. Delmonico, director of the kidney
transplant program at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.
Delmonico is also medical director of the New England Organ Bank,
the nation's oldest organ procurement agency, and although that
organization has not taken a position on the stipend, he said he
felt compelled to offer his personal views.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a fundamental objection to compensating
families,'' he said. But, noting that organs are sold on the black
market in some nations, he said he worries that ``this would be a
slippery slope toward the buying and selling of organs, which is
federally prohibited.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, transplant surgeons and organ procurement directors
across the nation are watching Pennsylvania's experiment closely,
and some are laying plans to follow it if it proves successful in
increasing donations. In a report issued last year, the New York
Task Force to Increase Organ and Tissue Donation recommended to the
state Department of Health a plan for funeral expense reimbursement
that ``might be modeled after the Pennsylvania approach, after
evaluation of Pennsylvania's experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of paying donor families is not new; it has been
debated in transplant circles for about a decade. In 1991, the
National Kidney Foundation staged a series of town hall meetings to
discuss the idea; the next year, the foundation paid for a
telephone poll that found 48 percent of people favored some form of
financial compensation to the families of organ donors, 42 percent
opposed it and 10 percent were undecided.

</P>
<P>
   ``Our position is that this should be tested to see whether it
serves a purpose,'' said Dolph Chianchiano, the group's director of
scientific and public policy. ``We are not talking about a
situation where the organ goes to the highest bidder, or that there
should be a market for organs. We are talking about a limited,
specified amount of money paid to a third party.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, others are adopting that view, said Dr. Charles
Miller, a transplant surgeon at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New
York City. Miller, who was the chairman of the New York Task force,
said the concept of payments had been so controversial that, for
years, ``people were scared to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Miller said: ``I think times have changed. I think the
organ donor shortage has become so public and so critical that
people are beginning to rethink.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   That there is a shortage at all is testimony to the success of
transplant surgery. As recently as 1990, for instance, there were
50 liver transplant centers in the country; today there are 120. As
more doctors learn how to transplant organs, more patients demand
organ transplants. According to the Department of Health and Human
Services, 56,716 people were waiting for hearts, lungs, livers,
pancreases and kidneys at the end of 1997; by the end of last year,
the list had grown to 64,423.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, sensing the growing crisis, lawmakers in Pennsylvania
adopted Pennsylvania Act 102. It required, among other things, that
hospitals notify organ procurement agencies of every death, a
provision that has since been put into place nationwide by the
federal government as a regulation adopted by the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   The Pennsylvania law also mandated public education programs to
increase awareness of the organ shortage. It permitted residents to
donate a small sum from their tax returns and motor vehicle
registration fees to an organ donor trust fund. And it authorized
the governor to create a 15-member advisory panel to make
recommendations about how the money should be spent.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, 10 percent of the fund may be used to reimburse
families for medical or funeral expenses, at a maximum of $3,000 to
any one family, according to Ms. Tierney of the state health
department. But the governor's advisory panel has determined that
the reimbursements should be much less, about $300 per family, Ms.
Tierney said.
</P>
<P>
   The trust fund now totaled about $800,000, she said, enough to
start making disbursements.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan being drafted, the procurement agencies would
inform families when their relatives died that they were eligible
for the benefit if they donated an organ. Experts have been trying
for years to understand why people refuse to donate organs. They
say that religious beliefs, the attitudes of doctors and nurses,
and the sensitivity of representatives of organ procurement
agencies, who put the delicate question to family members after
their loved ones have died, all play a part. But nobody knows if a
stipend will make a difference, because it has never been tried.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Pennsylvania pilot project will be tracked by
medical ethicists, who will interview families to determine if the
reimbursements have any effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very controversial, whether a voluntary benefit will
change donation or not,'' said one of the ethicists, Dr. Bob Arnold
of the University of Pittsburgh. ``My hypothesis, and it is merely
a hypothesis, is that families may feel as if they are doing this
out of altruism, and that any kind of benefit makes the giving feel
less altruistic. But in fact, I don't know.''

TORNADO SURVIVORS SORT THROUGH BITS AND PIECES LEFT OF THEIR LIVES

<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY _ They survived that wicked brute of a tornado and
finally got to go home Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But many found no home, just bits and pieces of brick, wood and
insulation, crumpled automobiles and everything they owned gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming back and seeing it all destroyed is kind of hard,''
said Chris Pillifant, who rode out Monday's tornado huddling in a
shower stall with his wife and 3-year-old golden retriever. ``This
just looks like 'Nam,'' he said referring to the war in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The casualty list resembled a war's toll: at least 38 dead,
hundreds injured, thousands homeless, dozens missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have over 100 missing persons reports ... at the present
time,'' said Ray Blakeney, director of operations for the state
medical examiner's office. He issued a public plea for help in
finding the missing.
</P>
<P>
   Although early damage estimates hovered around $225 million,
officials Wednesday called that figure low _ ``like really low,''
said Rick Buchanan, press spokesman for Gov. Frank Keating. The
latest estimates put loss at upwards of $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wouldn't surprise me a bit,'' Brad Craine, a spokesman
for the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the death count remained at 38, although
authorities said a man identified as John Green, believed to be
from Moore, died shortly before noon Wednesday. His name had not
been added to the official fatality list by nightfall.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, scores of people remained in area hospitals, many
suffering serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
   A 39-day-old baby clung to life at one hospital, his skull
shattered by flying debris; a 13-year-old girl was in serious
condition at another hospital with a broken neck; and a 33-year-old
woman was being treated for injuries suffered when a board or fence
post entered one side of her face and exited the other.
</P>
<P>
   Between 2,000 and 3,000 homes were destroyed or heavily damaged
in the Oklahoma City area, said David Van Nostrand, director of
Emergency Management Services for Oklahoma County.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of homes remain without electricity or gas, and 70
utility crews from Texas were expected to arrive in Oklahoma on
Thursday to help restore power.
</P>
<P>
   Residents allowed back into their neighborhoods for the first
time since Monday said they were among the lucky _ they had somehow
survived tornadoes packing winds approaching 260 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said our Hail Marys and kept yelling,'' said Pillifant, who
was buried in the rubble of the 2,000-square-foot house that
collapsed around him, his wife and dog.
</P>
<P>
   Cars by the hundreds lined up bumper to bumper at police
checkpoints where people had to show identification and proof they
lived in a certain neighborhood before they could enter.
</P>
<P>
   When John and Sheryl Molsbee drove onto their street, they found
their brick-and-frame home standing, but minus its roof. Still on
the stove was Monday's macaroni dinner in a pot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's worse than I thought,'' said John Molsbee, who wasn't
home when the giant twisters leveled neighborhoods in Oklahoma City
and surrounding communities.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the city, residents searched for irreplaceable
possessions: photographs, keepsakes and mementos collected before
the tornadoes shattered their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Some scoured their shredded and ravaged apartments and found
undamaged CDs, home videos and high school and college diplomas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It cost me $30,000,'' said Aaron Penix, 22, referring to his
sheepskin. ``I'm actually really surprised. It was merciful.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Chong Wren sat at an apartment complex with her back to
a fallen tree, its bark stripped away by tornadic winds. She had
survived by hiding in one of her unit's two bathrooms. The one she
chose remained untouched; the other disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had stayed there, I would have died,'' Wren said. ``I
don't know why I picked that one. It was Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   At Westmoore High School, the parking lot was littered with
scores of damaged vehicles, many of them turned upside down. Wood
from nearby houses speared the windshields of some. A dead horse
lay against the front bumper of a green pickup.
</P>
<P>
   Next door to the Pillifants, members of the Westmoore football
team helped their coach, Chris Stiles, sort through the rubble of
his family's home. They found eight albums with photos of Stiles'
two children.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I'm looking for,'' said Stiles, 36.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is the kids don't have a scratch. By the grace
of God, we're here and we'll rebuild better than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents face the task of rebuilding from what the
National Weather Service officially upgraded from F4 to F5 the
tornadoes that tore through Oklahoma City and Moore. An F5 tornado
is the most severe with winds exceeding 260 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Weather Service engineering teams tracing the tornadoes' paths
said one was 3/4 mile wide as it sliced a 40-mile swath rumbling
through Moore and Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   In one Oklahoma City neighborhood, police found part of an
airplane wing thought to have come from Chickasha, about 30 miles
southwest.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal officials, meanwhile, were making arrangements
to find housing for the displaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking tent cities,'' said Ben Frizzell of the
state Office of Civil Emergency Management. ``There is a disaster
housing program through FEMA that will provide rental assistance
for up to 18 months if needed. Some people may even use this to
rent travel trailers to put on their property.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Red Cross also passed out vouchers for people to
temporarily stay in motels.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tony Barlow, a lawyer, banker and philanthropist who
became active in religious efforts to encourage socially
responsible investing, died on Tuesday at Beth Israel Medical
Center-Petrie Division in lower Manhattan. He was 62 and lived on
the Upper East Side of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said a spokeswoman for the Brearley
School, where his wife, Priscilla Winn Barlow, is the head.
</P>
<P>
   Barlow was in the firm of Shearman &AMP; Sterling in New York, later
practiced law in Connecticut and moved to Kansas City, Mo., to join
his family's banking business.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992 he received a divinity degree from Episcopal Divinity
School in Cambridge, Mass. Moving to Toronto, he became involved in
socially responsible investing by the Anglican Church of Canada. In
1997 he and his wife moved to New York, and he served on the social
responsibility in investments committee of the Episcopal Church,
U.S.A.
</P>
<P>
   Milton M. Barlow was born in Minneapolis, and moved with his
family to Kansas City. He graduated from Phillips Academy, Yale
University and the University of Chicago's law school.
</P>
<P>
   His 1971 marriage to Diana Hallowell ended in divorce in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Along with his wife, he is survived by two sons, Ethan and
Benjamin, both of Manhattan; two stepdaughters, Philippa Cutter of
Madison, Conn., and Nicola Walsh of Kuranda, Australia; two
stepgrandchildren; his mother, Georgette Barlow of Kansas City; a
brother, John F., of Kansas City, and a sister, Sally Ittmann of
London.
</P>
<P>
   Paul J. Henry, 72; Headed Hospital Agency
</P>
<P>
   Paul James Henry, a New York lawyer who served as chairman of
the New York Health and Hospitals Corp. during the administration
of Mayor Edward Koch, died Saturday at his home in Grasmere, N.Y.
He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Henry was a director of the hospital agency's board from 1979 to
1990, and its chairman for the last four of those years. He also
served Koch as a special adviser on health services and was a
member of the city's Charter Revision Commission in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Topeka, Kan., Henry received law degrees from
Washburn University in 1952 and Harvard the following year. He was
a trial lawyer for the U.S. Treasury Department in Boston before
moving to New York, where he practiced on Staten Island and became
active in the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Henry is survived by his wife of 50 years, Frances Haggiag
Henry; a son, Michael J., of Bricktown, N.J.; two daughters,
Margaret H. Cozzolino of Staten Island, and Pamela Ann Henry of
Dobbs Ferry, N.Y.; a brother, William F., of Overland Park, Kan.; a
sister, Mary Alice Hunt of Lansing, Mich., and two grandsons.

MISSOURI GOVERNOR SAYS HE WILL VETO ABORTION BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL SENTELL  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. _ Gov. Mel Carnahan said Wednesday he will
veto an abortion bill that seems certain to win legislative
approval, but backers of the measure are optimistic they can
override any veto.
</P>
<P>
   In a clear win for abortion foes, Missouri senators ended a
marathon debate and filibuster at 12:10 a.m. Wednesday by approving
a bill that backers said would ban a certain late-term abortion
procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters said it would prohibit what they call
``partial-birth'' abortions by essentially labeling the procedure
infanticide. The procedure would be a felony unless it was done to
preserve the mother's life.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which was approved 27-6, now returns to the House,
where backers predict it will win easy approval, probably next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan, asked if he could sustain a veto, said: ``I am not
sure. We will make the fight. You never feel secure about
sustaining a veto, but we will work at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan said lack of a provision to permit such an abortion to
protect the mother's health, not just her life, was one of his key
objections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that is both bad policy and also clearly
unconstitutional,'' said the governor, who favors abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the bill, who contend the measure can withstand any
court challenge, said there is a good chance the House and Senate
can muster the two-thirds majorities needed for the law to take
effect despite Carnahan's veto.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan vetoed a similar bill two years ago. The Senate
sustained it by one vote. Any override attempt this year probably
would take place in September.
</P>
<P>
   An override would require 23 votes in the Senate and 109 in the
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the votes are more solid than they were two years
ago,'' said Sen. Ted House, a St. Charles Democrat and sponsor of
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Luetkenhaus, a Josephville Democrat and House sponsor,
noted that the House has already approved a similar bill with 129
votes, much more than the two-thirds needed for an override.
</P>
<P>
   However, one factor in Carnahan's favor is that political
dynamics change when the governor's prestige is on the line. Some
fellow Democrats do not want to embarrass him, even on an emotional
issue such as abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan's veto promise did not go unnoticed by the office of
U.S. Sen. John Ashcroft, the Republican whose post Carnahan is
seeking next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mel Carnahan is trying once again to impose his extreme
abortion views on Missouri, extending even to the horrible practice
of partial-birth abortion,'' said Steve Hilton, Ashcroft's press
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft, who opposes abortion, is co-sponsor of a Senate bill
to ban the practice. Two previous such bans passed by Congress were
vetoed by President Clinton. Similar bans are in effect in seven
states; they have been tied up in court or struck down in 19 other
states, according to the National Right to Life Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate debate and filibuster consumed six days and more than
38 hours, delaying action on virtually every other issue.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, action on the bill halted for 90 minutes when Sen.
Jet Banks, a St. Louis Democrat, disappeared after offering an
amendment. He returned Wednesday. Critics said Banks, who
criticized the bill, was trying to kill it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a diabetic,'' Banks said of his absence. ``My blood sugar
was going down.''
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the abortion bill cleared the way for final approval
of the state's $16 billion operating budget, which has to be done
by 6 p.m. Friday, and debates about tax cuts, crime, drunken
driving and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri said
that the bill was deceptive and would threaten women who seek
abortions already protected by the U.S. Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   House disputed that argument. He noted the bill says the measure
does not apply to legal abortions if they are done before the child
is ``partially born.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could not make it any clearer,'' House said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure under fire involves the partial, feet-first
extraction of the fetus. The barely visible skull is then punctured
with scissors and its contents are drained before the skull is
collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   The bill makes physicians subject to charges of infanticide. The
mother would not be liable unless suspected of taking a
``substantial step'' that results in the infant's death.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the bill said charges against the mother would be
unlikely, but critics disputed that.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan also denounced that provision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very idea we would be finding women culpable and charging
them with murder, putting them in jail, for making a health
decision is very disturbing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The only Kansas City area ``no'' votes on the bill were Sens.
Mary Groves Bland and Ed Quick, both Democrats. &QL;

MARBURY SCORES 41 AS THE NETS WIN FINALE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ This was supposed to be the beginning,
not the end. Wednesday night's regular-season finale against the
Milwaukee Bucks was supposed to mark the start of the most
successful post-season run in the Nets' 22-year history in the
National Basketball Association. The young and talented team from
New Jersey was a second-round lock, a potential Eastern Conference
finalist and, with a little luck, maybe more than that.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, those preseason predictions will not come to
pass. After John Calipari, at one time the team's upstart coach,
was dismissed, after six of the team's top nine players were
sidelined with season-ending injuries, and after two players
originally signed to 10-day contracts became starters by default,
the Nets will disperse summer vacations this weekend as arguably
the most disappointing team in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, why? Why, after making the playoffs last season
with a 43-39 record, overcoming numerous injuries along the way,
did the Nets degenerate into a team with a 16-34 record that lost
in routs to the woeful Los Angeles Clippers, Denver Nuggets and
Chicago Bulls?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is multifaceted, but clear, and much of it is rooted
in two men who have since been removed, Calipari and point guard
Sam Cassell, who was traded to Milwaukee on March 11 in the deal
that brought Stephon Marbury, who scored a career-high 41 points
Wednesday night in a 115-107 victory over Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   But there were other factors _ like the lack of a low-post
scorer, the various foot injuries to Rony Seikaly, and the subpar
play of Kerry Kittles _ but the Nets' 3-17 start fell largely onto
the shoulders of Calipari and Cassell.
</P>
<P>
   The season-ending injuries to Jayson Williams (broken leg),
Keith Van Horn (broken thumb), Jim McIlvaine (left shoulder) and
Scott Burrell (knee) had little to do with the Nets'
underachievement because all occurred after Calipari was fired and
the team had essentially been eliminated from the post-season race.
Despite those injuries, the Nets finished the season winning 13 of
30 games under the team's interim coach, Don Casey, adding more
evidence to the fact that Calipari had lost his players.
</P>
<P>
   When the season began, even on the heels of last year's
surprising success, the players' lack of respect, trust and belief
in Calipari was a dynamite stick waiting to be lighted. Many of the
players grew weary of Calipari's excessive ego and verbal assaults
last season, but because they were winning, it did not become a
major issue.
</P>
<P>
   But when the losses began stacking up, the little confidence the
players had in Calipari's coaching ability vanished altogether, and
some, including Kendall Gill, a co-captain, went to the Nets'
ownership with complaints. One Nets official who spoke on condition
of anonymity said that after Marbury's first two games with New
Jersey, he was amazed by the players' lack of respect for Calipari.
``I'd say John lost the players around the 10th game of the
season,'' another Nets executive said. ``And once that happened,
the season was basically over.''
</P>
<P>
   Cassell was a huge factor in this because if he did not sprain
his right ankle in the season opener and subsequently miss 15 of
the next 18 games, the Nets almost certainly would not have had
such a poor record, and the players would have pushed forward
despite their dislike for Calipari. Cassell admitted as much before
Wednesday night's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was healthy, the New Jersey Nets would be in the
playoffs,'' Cassell said. ``I know that for a fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Cassell went on to say that Calipari would still be the Nets'
coach if he had not been hurt. ``Cal made the game fun for me,'' he
said. ``A lot of guys didn't like his style and his charisma, but I
never had a problem with Cal. I think they made a drastic mistake
by giving up a guy like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Cassell was perhaps the only player in the Nets' locker room who
enjoyed playing for Calipari, and many of his teammates resented
the special privileges Calipari seemed to afford him, such as
loafing in practice, yelling at Calipari during games and even
refusing to re-enter games.
</P>
<P>
   When Cassell was injured, the situation became exacerbated
because some players felt that Cassell was faking and that Calipari
should have pushed him to play. Calipari lost credibility when he
refused to adjust his game plan to fit the team's personnel without
Cassell.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Murdock, Cassell's backup, could not play the uptempo,
helter-skelter game that Calipari favored, but the coach would not
implement a slower, more deliberate offense in which he could
thrive. Nor would he play a bigger lineup that featured McIlvaine
(and Seikaly, when healthy) at center alongside Williams and Van
Horn.
</P>
<P>
   The players, nearly all of whom want Casey to return as the head
coach next season, set a goal of winning 50 percent of their games
under the new coaching staff. If they had had Williams, Van Horn,
McIlvaine, Seikaly, Burrell and Murdock, they probably would have.

OKLAHOMA PLUCKS HOPE FROM RUBBLE

<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY _ After days of disaster and mourning, Oklahoma
struggled to its feet Wednesday and made plans to rebuild in the
wake of the state's worst tornadoes in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oklahomans are incredible,'' said Oklahoma City Mayor Kirk
Humphrey. ``They are in incredibly good spirits. They are digging
through rubble, reclaiming all kinds of things to rebuild their
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours after dawn Wednesday, garbage men armed with brooms and
carts, heavy machinery and dump trucks filtered into the city's
stricken neighborhoods to begin cleaning the streets and city
easements of debris.
</P>
<P>
   Taking advantage of sunny, windy weather, thousands of residents
climbed through the wreckage of their neighborhoods to salvage
fragments of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the mood among the ruins seemed upbeat. Many declared
their intention to clear their property and rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   But everywhere the devastation was apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's tornadoes _ at least three dozen swept through the
center of the state _ were the deadliest Oklahoma has suffered in
more than half a century.
</P>
<P>
   Medical Examiner Dr. Ray Blakeney on Wednesday reported that the
confirmed death toll in Oklahoma remained at 38. But as many as 100
people have been reported missing, and efforts to locate them among
the more than 600 Oklahomans treated for storm injuries proved
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four of the victims, Blakeney said, have been identified.
The bodies of 18 or 19 have been released to their families.
</P>
<P>
   Six additional people died in neighboring Kansas when the storms
hit the Wichita area.
</P>
<P>
   At least 1,854 homes in Oklahoma City were damaged or destroyed
by the twisters, said Public Works Director Paul Brum, and the
number statewide was thought to have exceeded 5,000. Federal
Emergency Management Administration official Lacy Suiter said
property damage in Kansas likely matched or topped that in
Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Brum placed damage in the state capital at approximately $250
million, but other officials suggested damage in the greater
Oklahoma City area might reach $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   State Farm Insurance spokeswoman Beth Hamilton said her company
is expecting as many as 26,000 damaged-home claims, totaling $100
million. In addition, it expects 12,000 auto claims, totaling
approximately $48 million.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton said she was unable to compare the storm claims to
those from comparable natural disasters. ``We've just never seen
anything like this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In heavily hit suburban Moore, school officials said two
schools, an elementary and a high school, may have been destroyed.
Initial estimates placed damage at $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, they said, the district's students will return to
class in an improvised off-campus site May 10.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma City Police Chief M.T. Berry on Wednesday lifted a
curfew for neighborhoods that were only slightly damaged, but
warned that some areas remain dangerous. ``There are boards with
nails, glass _ and when it gets dark, you won't be able to see,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In some areas, thousands of current and former residents took to
the street to examine their storm-damaged property. A six-mile-long
traffic jam formed as motorists tried to enter the devastated
suburb of Moore.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Haggard was among Moore residents grimly surveying the
damage Wednesday. Haggard said he and his family first had sought
shelter in a hallway, but abandoned the house when they heard the
tornado's fearsome roar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hearing it, you could tell it wasn't just another storm,'' he
said. ``We went to get in the van, and it was huge. Stuff was
flying by, being sucked into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Haggard was wryly able to see a bright side.
</P>
<P>
   Haggard was a volunteer worker during the May 1997 Jarrell
tornado that killed 27 people. In Moore, he noted, the tornado left
shattered wood and other debris. In Texas, the storm had left
wreckage the consistency of papier mache.
</P>
<P>
   Moore residents Marilyn and Rusty Yeakley also were on the
street Wednesday, searching the rubble of their home for their
wedding photograph.
</P>
<P>
   They, too, had planned to ride out the storm, they said. ``But I
thought `somebody upstairs' was trying to tell us something,'' said
Yeakley, an architect. ``We grabbed Felix the cat and got out of
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes later, the house collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   About all that was left Wednesday was the residence's house
number. The Yeakleys vowed to rebuild at the same site.
</P>
<P>
   A curious aspect of the tornadoes, Police Chief Berry noted, was
the degree to which paper items, including bank and insurance
documents, were spread around the devastated neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The chief warned homeowners that such papers might be scavenged
and used by the unscrupulous to perpetrate fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Berry said that officers also have recovered more than 40
firearms that apparently were scattered by the tornadoes. They have
been tagged and will be returned to those who can prove ownership,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Berry said no looting has been reported in the city. Armed
officers have been stationed at virtually every intersection in the
damaged areas.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen from local utility companies said electricity has been
restored to all but 26,000 of the 121,000 area customers who lost
power during the storm. Most service should be restored within a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the American Red Cross, which opened 10 emergency
shelters to house about 1,600 storm refugees, Wednesday announced
that three shelters would be closed for lack of need.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Humphrey noted that many people driven out of their homes
have found shelter with friends and neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Red Cross' Oklahoma City headquarters was
jammed with volunteers. Seventy signed up in an hour, said
volunteer Lana Hale. One man from Tulsa, she said, offered to
donate hundreds of sleeping bags.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, just 24 hours after President Clinton declared 11
counties in Oklahoma and Kansas eligible for federal disaster
assistance, more than 1,000 people had requested the aid.
</P>
<P>
   FEMA's Suiter reported that those eligible may receive grants
for temporary housing, minimal emergency home repairs and medical
or funeral expenses. Low-interest loans for uninsured residential
losses also are available, he said.

DEKALB BATTERED AND SHAKEN BUT SURVIVING IN AFTERMATH OF TORNADO 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM HENDERSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DeKALB, Texas _ Wet and wild, the winds came up from the
Southwest on Tuesday afternoon and, somewhere beyond the athletic
fields, spun a funnel that filled the afternoon air with a
thunderous roar.
</P>
<P>
   DeKalb, population not quite 2,000, was in for a taste of nature
at its ugliest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The principal was on the porch watching,'' said Jeannie
Foster, the elementary school counselor. ``He came back inside, and
the kids put their heads down. We had gone through our safety
drills that morning. They knew what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   As they ducked in the hallway, the raging winds slammed into the
school, cutting off the electricity, ripping off a portion of the
roof and buckling the walls. The clocks on the walls stopped at
3:02 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could feel the suction,'' Foster said. ``The roof was
gone, and the rain was coming in. We smelled the gas and evacuated
the kids onto the playground.''
</P>
<P>
   In a few seconds, the fury had passed, moved on to the high
school, shattering glass, felling beams and hurling debris. Several
teachers and students were injured, including Troy Bullard, a coach
who was trapped under a mound of rubble with a collapsed lung.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the tornado, grinding a path two blocks wide,
battered a row of modest frame houses on both sides of Broadway on
its way to the center of town.
</P>
<P>
   Boyce Rhea was outside talking on the phone to his son in
Texarkana when he realized what was coming. As he ran back inside,
shingles began to fly off the roof. He dropped to the floor just as
the wind hit, flinging him and his sofa across the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then it was gone,'' he said, watching backhoes and chain saws
clearing rubble from his and his neighbors' yards. Eleven stitches
sealed a long gash down the front of his head. ``It probably lasted
five to eight seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   Crossing Texas 82, moving, some residents were told, at 65 mph,
the twister disemboweled the Austin Hotel and the dentist and
insurance offices that occupy the ground floor.
</P>
<P>
   It flattened a convenience store, damaged a Bowie County
Sheriff's Department substation, tore metal walls and doors from
the fire station, bent columns and took sections of roof from the
First Baptist Church and took out a dozen homes as it headed out of
town.
</P>
<P>
   N.T. Howell and his wife, who gets around with the aid of a
walker, had been hearing the storm-warning sirens for 20 minutes
when the television suddenly went blank.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife got up and started toward a closet, but I took her
into the bathroom,'' he said Wednesday, sitting beside what was
left of his house. ``It happened so fast. There was just this loud
roar, and then it was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Emerging from the bathroom, he found his house in ruins.
Outside, stunned neighbors already were gathering on the street and
in yards to count their losses. Trees and electrical poles were
scattered randomly in the wake of the tornado, and a web of
telephone and power lines covered everything. The odor of natural
gas blew across the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was amazing that all were saved,'' Jeannie Foster said.
</P>
<P>
   Some were luckier than others. A spokeswoman for the county's
ambulance service said 12 residents were transported to hospitals
in Texarkana, and three of them suffered serious injuries,
apparently from falling ceilings and wind-borne debris.
</P>
<P>
   Belinda Peek, the city administrator, said 90 percent of the
downtown structures were damaged and half of those ``are gone.''
The elementary school and the high school, including the gymnasium,
were destroyed, she said. At least 50 to 60 houses were damaged, a
dozen of them destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday morning, tiny DeKalb had the look of a
battleground. Military-style tents were erected on a grassy expanse
in front of City Hall, where Salvation Army, Red Cross and county
emergency vehicles lined the street. Police cars cruised the
torn-up areas, and state troopers stopped traffic coming into town.
</P>
<P>
   After a tour of the area, Gov. George W. Bush said he had
declared a state of emergency so state teams can assess the damage
Thursday to determine whether the state can apply for federal
disaster relief.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said officials also are talking to state Education
Commissioner Mike Moses about how DeKalb's students can finish the
school year without a school.

THE HOUSE IS GONE, BUT `AT LEAST WE'RE STILL ALIVE' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By EVAN MOORE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGE CREEK, Okla. _ Volunteer Fire Chief Steve Emery was
assisting at a wreck scene on Interstate 44 about 6:30 p.m. Monday
when he saw the massive, black funnel cloud approaching his
community.
</P>
<P>
   Two miles away, in the heart of this once bucolic little
subdivision, Bob and Jeannie Spear were looking out the sliding
glass doors of their second-story living room. Their view was of a
normally glassy pond in the southwest quadrant of this
five-square-mile community. At that moment it was ominously black
on the horizon, however, and the Spears were preparing to take
shelter in the laundry room below.
</P>
<P>
   A stone's throw from the Spears, Jay Lovett, was already hiding
in a storm cellar with his wife and son, two nephews and his
sister-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   The next few moments would impress themselves on all of them.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday Emery, Lovett and the Spears looked over the
devastated remains of their neighborhood, one of the hardest hit by
storms and one where more than a dozen died. As they did, their
memories all returned to that same interval in time on Monday, and
to the same terrifying 30 seconds in which they were all frozen by
the high-pitched whine of a monstrous tornado.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked at least a mile wide,'' said Emery, ``and it just
whipped toward Bridge Creek.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I saw it and heard it I knew how bad it was and I
left the wreck and headed back for the community.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spears were not so immediately concerned. They'd seen storms
before, and the retired Baptist missionary and his wife grabbed a
couple of crossword puzzles and went to their downstairs laundry
room to wait out the worst.
</P>
<P>
   They sat quietly for a few minutes, until the lights dimmed and
they heard a tremendous roar and a popping sound they thought was
hail. The crosswords had given way to prayers when, suddenly, a
small hole appeared in the plaster of the outside wall. Jeannie
Spear eyed it calmly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to have to fix that, Bob,'' she said, just before
her ears began to close from a sudden increase in barometric
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the storm shelter, Lovett was trying to calm his
9-year-old nephew. He heard the high-pitched squeal of wind and
watched as the vent pipe was ripped away above him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never heard a sound like that,'' he said. ``It didn't last
but 30 seconds, but I knew it was a huge tornado.''
</P>
<P>
   It was. The F-5 tornado, the most destructive possible, cut a
capricious swathe of destruction through this unincorporated, rural
community. In a matter of minutes it killed at least 13 people and
injured dozens more, destroyed 235 homes and left a barren, denuded
wake through the middle of Bridge Creek. Eight residents remain
unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after it had passed, as Emery was pulling into town, Bob
Spear opened the laundry room door, looked out and turned to his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget about the hole in the wall, Jeannie,'' he said. ``The
house is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Lovett was prying open the cellar door, blocked by a fallen
tree. He looked toward his sister-in-law's home and turned back to
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to tell you before you see it,'' he said. ``There's
nothing left of your house.''
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing left of many others.
</P>
<P>
   The tornado flattened much of Bridge Creek, a working-class
haven about 20 miles southwest of Oklahoma City, and left at least
500 of its 7,500 residents homeless. By Tuesday morning its
elementary school had become a temporary triage unit for the
wounded, its middle-school gymnasium a morgue for the dead.
</P>
<P>
   At least 400 of its residents were sleeping in Red Cross
shelters Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   There was no electric power to Bridge Creek, no water and no
phones.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Emery was directing fire units as they combed the area
looking for leaking propane tanks while workers with a backhoe were
burying dead livestock.
</P>
<P>
   There were scores of volunteers and an abundance of donated food
and clothing. A Red Cross shelter at the edge of the community was
overflowing with donations and friends were helping the Spears sort
through the tangled mess of what had been their vacation home.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're only things,'' said Jeannie Spear, as she looked at
the scattered remnants of a Bible-study book she had been
assembling. ``At least we're still alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Lovett was helping a neighbor gather strewn clothing.
Lovett's home had been spared except for roof damage and he was
preparing to move back in as soon as electricity was available.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was lucky,'' he said. ``None of my family were hurt. We'll
move back in and I'll have a storm cellar dug by next year and
we'll weather more storms in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, you know, I don't think I'll ever forget that sound.''

COVER: WHAT'S CAUSING THE VIOLENCE? 
 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
 FROM THE FORT WORTH STAR-TELEGRAM
</HEADLINE>
  World rights. 
 By KELLY DEGARMO, with Staff and Wire Reports 
 Copyright 1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By the time teen-agers Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris finished
their rampage last month at Columbine High in Colorado, they ranked
among this country's worst mass killers.
</P>
<P>
   During the last three weeks, everyone has asked why? Why would
they murder fellow classmates? What made them do it?
</P>
<P>
   The phrase ``desensitized to violence'' has come up over and
over again. This buzzword ``desensitized'' is one youths will be
hearing a lot. It means to become so accustomed to violence that it
no longer upsets you. It means students can sit by and watch a
fellow classmate get beaten up and have his $100 tennis shoes
stolen, and do nothing about it. Perhaps not even tell their
parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people are becoming more used to violence. Kids are
becoming exposed to it at a younger age. They see Power Rangers
fight the bad guys; it's fantasy violence but it's still
violence,'' said high school student Megan Carroll. ``If you've
watched Mortal Kombat Conquest on Saturday mornings, it's some
pretty violent stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton addressed America with a speech about
``desensitization.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We must face up to the fact that these school shootings are
more than isolated incidents,'' Clinton said in a weekly radio
address last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are symptoms of a changing culture that desensitizes our
children to violence,'' he said. He emphasized that most teen-agers
have seen hundreds of killings on television, in movies and in
video games before they graduate from high school. Do violent video
games teach kids how to be sharpshooters?
</P>
<P>
   Police said the Columbine High killers had the precision of
sharpshooters. And they played hours and hours of violent video
games _ the same games that the military uses for training its
soldiers to fight wars. A recent episode of CBS's ``60 Minutes''
reported that the military uses Doom, among other video games, in
military training.
</P>
<P>
   ``These violent visual images have a profound and powerful
influence on them,'' said retired Army Lt. Col. Dave Grossman. He
spoke during a juvenile justice conference last month in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman said the growing violence among teens is directly
related to television, video games and movies. Children who view
violence in the movies and on television are more prone to say
``cool'' than to express horror, he said. In the case of video
games, game players aren't just passively watching _ they're
shooting back with guns. The rating system, to most kids, ``is a
joke,'' Megan said. Is Hollywood responsible?
</P>
<P>
   Parents are taking Hollywood to court. The parents of the
students killed by Michael Carneal, a 14-year-old freshman in
Paducah, Ky., are suing several entertainment companies for $130
million. They're charging that computer games and the Leonardo
DiCaprio movie ``The Basketball Diaries'' made Michael Carneal do
what he did. The movie is about a student who kills his fellow
classmates.
</P>
<P>
   Research has found that children who spend the most time playing
violent games have the lowest self-esteem. They see themselves as
less popular, less skilled academically and less athletic, says
child psychologist Jeanne Funk.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the responsibility does fall on the games industry, but
some of it must fall on the parents, Megan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents need to stay informed, monitor what their kids are
watching and reading and playing,'' Megan said. ``I think if
parents paid a little more attention to their kids, these things
wouldn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Children must learn right from wrong. And it's wrong to hurt
people.
</P>
<P>
   FIGHT FOR YOUR RIGHTS: FREE BROCHURE
</P>
<P>
   In connection with its ``Fight For Your Rights, Take a Stand
Against Violence,'' MTV has produced a 24-page action guide booklet
giving young people ways to get involved with preventing violence.
To get a free copy, call (800) 268-0078.
</P>
<P>
   WARNING SIGNS
</P>
<P>
   If you notice any of these signs in a friend, relative or
classmate, speak to a trusted adult immediately:
</P>
<P>
   Abusive behavior toward animals.
</P>
<P>
   Depression.
</P>
<P>
   Talk of killing or suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Bragging about weapons.
</P>
<P>
   A change in behavior, eating or sleeping habits.
</P>
<P>
   Prior problems at school or in the community.
</P>
<P>
   A difficult relationship with a parent or friend.
</P>
<P>
   Isolation _ loners who don't fit in.
</P>
<P>
   Irritable and argumentative behavior.
</P>
<P>
   A change in physical appearance or hygiene.

MOVIE REVIEW: ``TWIN DRAGONS'' 
 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

  World rights. 
 Includes one color slide of a scene from the movie ``Twin
Dragons,'' starring Jackie Chan. (Credit: Copyright 1999 Dimension

   ``TWIN DRAGONS''
</P>
<P>
   Starring: Jackie Chan, Maggie Cheung and Teddy Robin.
</P>
<P>
   Plot: Twin brothers are separated at birth in a semi-freak
accident. One grows up in America living the sweet life while the
other toughs it out in the streets of Hong Kong. When they are
adults they run into each other and become entwined in each other
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Why go see it: ``Twin Dragons'' is a movie only for die-hard
Jackie Chan fans. Its dubbed voices are not much better than the
old Godzilla movies. If you enjoy decent karate action this film
might be for you.
</P>
<P>
   Reasons for rating: The PG-13 is for violence and mild sex
scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewer's 1 - 10 rating: 6.5.

 CD REVIEW: JOEY McINTYRE, STAY THE SAME  World rights.

<TEXT>
<P>
   If an old member of New Kids on the Block releases a new solo
CD, does anyone care? Unless you are a die-hard fan of the early
'90s pop group, probably not.
</P>
<P>
   The songs on McIntyre's debut CD are mostly pop ballads and
dance music. If you're into 'N Sync or Backstreet Boys, you might
like it. While I am a fan of both groups, I didn't really like this
CD. It either put me to sleep or got on my nerves because the
choruses were too repetitive. It's the type of CD you could listen
to for about two or three days, and then have all the songs
memorized.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, I liked the romantic lyrics of a few songs,
but then I couldn't remember if I was listening to 'N Sync, the
Backstreet Boys or Joey McIntyre.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to hate the CD, because Joey McIntrye has made a
strong effort to return to the music world, and you can't help but
admire the guy for trying. Plus those great baby-blue eyes of his
on the CD cover tend to make you like him even more. Who knows _
maybe some poor fan who's been waiting for the return of New Kids
on the Block can finally breathe a sigh of relief.

ADVICE ABOUT DRUGS, CORPORAL PUNISHMENT 
 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
 FROM THE FORT WORTH STAR-TELEGRAM
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   DEAR TeensTalk: A friend of mine has become addicted to
morphine. He worried me and my other friends so much that we got
him into rehab. After about two weeks he came out and really seemed
changed. Then he started using again. Now he is worse than before.
He shoots up every day and steals money to support his habit. His
parents couldn't take it anymore, so they threw him out. We don't
hang out anymore, but I still want to help him. What can I do?
Drugs.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR Drugs: Your friend is in serious danger. Two weeks in rehab
usually isn't enough time to cure a person of drug use. It sounds
like your friend has good parents who tried and don't know where to
turn next. They were forced to throw their son out of the house for
the family to survive. Families can't let one member destroy the
rest of the family. They tried when they sent him to rehab. Often
drug addicts will steal from their families or become violent to
support their habits.
</P>
<P>
   You could talk to your friend's family and let them know you are
concerned and would like to recommend that the family and friends
join an organization such as Tough Love at (972) 558-1762. This
group meets in local neighborhoods and consists of parents and
friends of troubled youth; its purpose is to support families and
help them deal with violence, drug abuse and other problems.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Bridge/STAR Program at (817) 332-3317 has some
excellent programs and will house and counsel troubled youth. There
are other drug-abuse hot lines and organizations that can help your
friend. The key is whether your friend wants help. You and your
friends can help best by talking to his parents and encouraging
your friend to get help. Drug habits are hard to break.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR TeensTalk: When my brother was sent to the office, our
principal threatened him with a belt. My brother got scared and
told him to call our parents. He didn't. I think he has been
hurting other children. Punished.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR Punished: This sounds like abuse of power by a person who
holds power over another. There are discipline methods other than
corporal punishment available to your principal. You should talk to
your parents about what happened and have them talk to your
brother, then contact the school to talk to the principal. Your
parents need to make an appointment with the principal about your
brother's behavior and discipline.
</P>

STAR STRUCK? CHECK OUT YOUR WEEK 
 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
 FROM THE FORT WORTH STAR-TELEGRAM
</HEADLINE>
  World rights. 
 By Students SARABETH BALON and NICK FOREMAN

<P>
   Before finalizing your activities, take time to read the
following horoscope, which is a fun way to plan your week.
</P>
<P>
   TAURUS (April 20 - May 20): Your worries do not seem to be worth
the hassle lately, but your perseverance will set an example for
those who look up to you. You can make it through this rough time
in your life if you maintain a positive attitude. The choice is
yours and nobody else's. Choose wisely.
</P>
<P>
   GEMINI (May 21 - June 20): Quit putting things off. If you have
the spare time, force yourself to get the chores over with so you
can get to the more entertaining activities. Turn your radio on and
``whistle while you work.'' You can make the work fun and get it
over with, then go play.
</P>
<P>
   CANCER (June 21 - July 22): A drastic change is approaching.
Open your eyes, and you will be able to picture it. Take this as a
warning because it may take some getting used to. If you can
picture it, the mental preparations will make it easier to accept.
</P>
<P>
   LEO (July 23 - Aug. 22): People do not appreciate the
supercilious attitude you have been giving off lately. Believe it
or not, you do not know everything about everything. Humble
yourself before your attitude puts you in a humbling situation.
This may be hard, but those who matter most to you will notice and
like it.
</P>
<P>
   VIRGO (Aug. 23 - Sept. 22): You will be soaring to great heights
in the next few weeks. Your positive attitude and optimism is
taking you places you have never been before. The smile you are
wearing will help you achieve a goal.
</P>
<P>
   LIBRA (Sept. 23 - Oct. 22): You will never get anything more out
of something than what you put into it. Give everything that you do
a wholehearted attempt rather than loafing off and just muddling
through. Your whole life will be much more exciting and you will
learn more than you ever thought imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   SCORPIO (Oct. 23 - Nov. 21): This week will not appear to be one
of your better ones at first, but it will be one that you will want
to repeat. This week will be extremely clear and productive, but
your friends' attitudes could overwhelm you and your good mood. Try
to help them, but do not let them bog you down.
</P>
<P>
   SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22 - Dec. 21): There is some spectacular news
waiting for you at the end of the week. Share your news with
everybody. Something that you have always wanted to come true might
actually be starting to come around. Do not get so caught up with
this that you shun your friends and what they have to say.
</P>
<P>
   CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 - Jan. 19): One day this week, you will be
struck by a brilliant idea that could change the way you feel about
something. Before you forget it, write it down, tell a friend or
both. Most awesome ideas are lost in the business of every day, but
that is not going to happen to you. While it is still fresh in your
head, take time to completely think it out.
</P>
<P>
   AQUARIUS (Jan. 20 - Feb. 18): Take your cutie somewhere out of
the ordinary this weekend. Get all dressed up and make a date out
of it. Even if there is nothing to celebrate, celebrate just for
the fun of it. Watch for some side-effects of slight depression in
your friend. If it's caught early, depression is much easier to
handle.
</P>
<P>
   PISCES (Feb. 19 - March 20): You will surprise yourself this
week. You might find yourself being the analyst in your class
discussions, or you might hit that high note in full voice. Pat
yourself on the back and then try to go further with what you have
done. Do not settle.
</P>
<P>
   ARIES (March 21 - April 19): You will discover the inspiration
that you have been searching for the past month or so. The school
year is nearing its end, but it ain't over till the fat lady sings
(or something along those lines). Your lack of motivation will be
temporarily revived, so you can make it through the rest of the
year.
</P>

 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

   HIGHWAY SMASH-UP
</P>
<P>
   COLTON, Calif. _ A sudden storm, high speeds and rush-hour
traffic led to multiple pileups that left about 70 people injured
and 150 vehicles mangled along a stretch of Interstate 10 on April
28, authorities said. Wreckage was scattered for miles, but no
deaths were reported. At least 67 people were taken to hospitals;
others were treated at the scene. Some collisions involved more
than 25 vehicles. Heavy rain, hail and winds up to 50 mph were
reported in the area.
</P>
<P>
   IS DEION DONE?
</P>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Dallas Cowboy Deion Sanders underwent surgery
Wednesday on his injured left big toe and is expected to begin an
aggressive, four- to six-month period of rehabilitation in three
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jones, the Cowboys' owner, wouldn't speculate on when
Sanders will return. He did say the All-Pro cornerback might miss
all of training camp and perhaps the start of the season. Jones
also said the injury means Sanders can't play wide receiver. ``We
are going to prepare our team like Deion is not going to be
there,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   BAGGAGE THIEVES ARRESTED
</P>
<P>
   GRAPEVINE, Texas _ Ten baggage handlers have been arrested in
connection with the thefts of thousands of dollars' worth of items
from luggage passing through Dallas/Fort Worth International
Airport. The handlers, who work in the baggage sorting and cargo
holding areas, are suspected of stealing items from about 500 bags.
The case is under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   MANSON CUTS TOUR SHORT
</P>
<P>
   CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa _ Shock rocker Marilyn Manson cut short his
concert and abruptly walked off the stage when he realized someone
had stuck a large yellow smiley face on a stage prop. The resulting
rowdiness ended in 23 arrests.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 4,765 appeared stunned when Manson _ already the
target of criticism this week alleging that his wild, ``gothic''
style influenced the Littleton, Colo., school shooting _ became
angry Wednesday and stormed off the stage early. Some in the crowd
became rowdy and swarmed Manson's tour bus.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, hundreds of demonstrators rallied outside a Manson
concert in Minneapolis, protesting possible links between his dark
music and the Colorado school killings. At the same time, Manson
announced the cancellation of next week's last five dates of his
U.S. tour, saying it was out of respect for the victims of the
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Manson, who took his stage name from Marilyn Monroe and mass
killer Charles Manson, said he blames the tragedy on ignorance,
hatred and access to guns.

ROCKETTE HOPEFULS AUDITION   AT L.A. STUDIO

<P>
   NORTH HOLLYWOOD, Calif. -- Rolling on the balls of their feet,
thrusting arms high with wrists bent, all the while keeping backs
straight and heads sharp, dozens of young women seek Linda
Haberman's eye.
</P>
<P>
   The choreographer is quick with corrections, demonstrating the
jazz combination and issuing a clear reminder: ``OK, I really want
it that clean, ladies.''
</P>
<P>
   Nichole Martinez's dream of becoming one of the world-famous
Rockettes was still alive after that first elimination Wednesday as
she and about 30 other versatile dancers moved on to the tap
combination, while more than 60 less-fortunate dancers were walking
out of the North Hollywood dance studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always wanted to be a Rockette. They just look like
sophisticated women and it looks just like a classy show,'' said
the statuesque 24-year-old Valley Village resident.
</P>
<P>
   Then came tapping and turning to the tune ``Here Comes Santa
Claus.'' The sounds of steel heels and toes clattering on the
hardwood floor was deafening, but apparently not distracting as the
dancers learned the combination of steps.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 dancers were sharp enough to make today's callback and
a shot at one of the seven casts of The Radio City Christmas
Spectacular -- which bills itself as the No. 1 live show in
America, based on attendance.
</P>
<P>
   The admittedly nervous Martinez will have to try again next
year, after improving her tap steps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I can do it. I definitely will try again,'' she said.
``If you want it bad enough, you will.''
</P>
<P>
   Each year, hundreds of dancers turn out in hopes of joining the
show that premiered at Radio City Music Hall in New York City in
1933 and remains a Christmas holiday favorite.
</P>
<P>
   There have been more slots to fill since the show began
expanding in 1994. Seven shows will play simultaneously in seven
cities during December -- Universal Amphitheatre and Las Vegas are
the venues out west -- and more than 2 million fans will see more
than 550 performances.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the competition is no easier. Even those from previous casts
must audition each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want the best,'' Haberman said.
</P>
<P>
   A Broadway musical veteran who has been the Rockettes' director
and choreographer the past eight years, Haberman needs about two
hours of increasingly difficult dance combinations to weed out the
best. Dancers need talent, but they also must be able to understand
and follow specific corrections because the Rockettes are a unit,
not a corps of soloists.
</P>
<P>
   ``On an emotional level it never gets easy to do. I know what it
feels to be on that end,'' she explained during a break. ``But part
of being in this field is having to deal with rejection.''
</P>
<P>
   In such a competitive atmosphere, the dancers' camaraderie
includes applauding for each other and exchanging smiles and hushed
comments on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great opportunity because when you become a Rockette,
you become a part of history,'' said Kelli Coleman, a Studio City
resident in her late 20s.
</P>
<P>
   After gaining a spot in the Branson, Mo., show following her
first audition in 1994, Coleman has made the show every year since,
including the inaugural Los Angeles cast last year.
</P>
<P>
   Having to audition each year keeps the veterans on their toes.
They do have the advantage of knowing what Haberman wants. But
they, too, must wait until June when the final cast is called.

TEXAS ATTORNEY GENERAL ACCUSES PREDECESSOR OF FRAUD 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   TEXARKANA, Texas _ Attorney General John Cornyn accused his
predecessor, Dan Morales, Wednesday of using fraud to try to win a
quarter of a billion dollars in legal fees for a friend in the
state's tobacco suit.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn, in a document &UR;  &LR; filed in federal court here, said two
contracts that Morales claimed to have with Houston attorney Marc
Murr were ``fake'' or ``bogus'' and did not exist on the dates they
were purportedly signed.
</P>
<P>
   But Morales' lawyer said the accusation by a Republican attorney
general is part of an effort to discredit Morales, a Democrat, so
he will not run for governor in 2002. Morales ended his second term
as attorney general Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn, a former state Supreme Court justice, says he has
evidence that a state arbitration panel's award of $260 million to
Murr was ``procured by fraud.'' He claims &UR;  &LR; Morales created one of
the contracts by replacing the signature of one of his assistants
with Murr's signature.
</P>
<P>
   Such a ploy would make it appear that Murr was actually working
with Morales on the tobacco suit months before he ever made an
appearance in the case. Specifically, Cornyn claims that a 1996
contract Morales signed with Murr was not actually created until
1998, a move that Cornyn said would mislead a federal judge
deciding on fees in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Murr nor his attorney, Roy Minton, returned phone calls
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Morales' lawyer, Sam Millsap of San Antonio, called the
accusations politically motivated, ``bizarre'' and ``false.'' He
said Republicans like Cornyn know that Morales would be a strong
contender if he decides to run for governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans are scared to death that Dan Morales is going
to run for governor in 2002,'' said Millsap. ``What they are doing
is everything they can to take Dan out. It is the worst imaginable
slime job.''
</P>
<P>
   Millsap said Morales will answer the specifics of the
allegations at the ``appropriate'' time.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether Morales had post-dated any contracts with
Murr, Millsap replied: ``The allegation is that fraud was
committed. That is untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn's court filing was made on the eve of Thursday's hearing
at which Murr is supposed to show why the $260 million fee awarded
by a state arbitration panel shouldn't be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   The state arbitrators were all chosen by Morales and Murr, and
Cornyn has asked U.S. District Judge David Folsom to dismiss their
award and instead abide by a national arbitration panel's figure of
$1 million for Murr. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The document Cornyn filed Wednesday was in response to dueling
motions between him and Morales over the possibility of getting
Morales to testify in today's court hearing. Late Wednesday, Folsom
quashed Cornyn's subpoena for possible Morales testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Morales' claim that Murr deserved a big share of the attorneys'
fees from the $17.3 billion tobacco settlement has been under
attack since Murr first made an appearance at the national
arbitration panel last December. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The other attorneys in the case said they had never seen Murr
at any of the negotiations with the cigarette manufacturers and
believed he did little, if any, work on the case. His name does not
appear on any of the hundreds of legal documents in 1996-97 leading
up to the tobacco settlement. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Morales, who worked with Murr at Bracewell &AMP; Patterson in
Houston in the early '80s, has said that he consulted his friend
early on in the tobacco case and had signed separate contracts with
him for his services. He said Murr's advice was ``critical'' to the
state and that Murr wanted his work to be discreet and
behind-the-scenes.
</P>
<P>
   But the mystery surrounding Murr and controversy over the huge
fees going to tobacco attorneys in general _ $3.3 billion to the
five leading attorneys who won the Texas case _ prompted Cornyn to
investigate. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Two separate contracts between Morales and Murr have been
previously reported. The first, which promised Murr 3 percent of
whatever damages the state eventually recovered, was reportedly
signed in October 1996, although Morales has said Murr worked on
the case for months before that.
</P>
<P>
   That contract was replaced by a Jan. 31, 1997, agreement that
simply provided that Murr would be paid a ``reasonable fee.'' After
the tobacco settlement was reached, Murr agreed to submit his fees
to arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   In his response to Morales' motion to quash his subpoena, Cornyn
said Morales created the Jan. 31, 1997, contract by switching the
signatures of Morales, Murr and then-assistant Jorge Vega from an
earlier proposed contract.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier contract from which the signatures were switched,
Cornyn said, had proposed a 6 percent contingency contract for Murr
and Will Pryor, a former high-level Morales staffer who is now a
mediator in Dallas. Cornyn said Pryor ``decided not to go forward
with the 6 percent agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The purported Jan. 31, 1997, `contract' providing Murr the
right to recover a `reasonable fee' is a fake _ it did not exist on
Jan. 31, 1997,'' Cornyn said.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's court filing, which was signed by
Cornyn's first assistant, Andy Taylor, accused Murr and Morales of
attempting to mislead Folsom, the state arbitration panel and the
public.
</P>
<P>
   In a secret meeting with the state arbitrators last fall, Cornyn
alleged, Morales submitted a 3 percent contingency contract for
Murr in an effort to win the Houston lawyer as much as $520 million
in fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state will prove that the 3 percent contract which was
submitted to the state arbitration panel, which purports to have
been created on Oct. 17, 1996, was not in fact created until
1998,'' Cornyn said.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn said the alleged ``conspiracy'' began to unravel before
the national arbitration panel last December, when attorneys for
the tobacco industry suspected that the 3 percent contract was
``bogus.''
</P>
<P>
   But, the attorney general continued, Morales refused the
industry's request for a copy of the contract in advance and
refused tobacco lawyers' demands that he testify under oath about
the contract before the national arbitrators.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, Cornyn has said Murr's role in the tobacco suit also
is being investigated by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported Saturday that the FBI has been
comparing computer hard-drive data to a paper analysis to try to
determine whether certain contracts and letters were backdated to
make it appear that Murr was involved in the tobacco case earlier.
