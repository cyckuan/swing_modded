Two Philippine military helicopters collide, three killed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Two air force helicopters armed with
rockets struck each other and crashed near a southern Philippine
military air base where they took off Sunday, killing two pilots
and a crewman, officials said.
	   Three other air force crewmen were injured in the accident in
Zamboanga City, air force spokesman Lt. Col. Fredesvindo
Cobarrubias said.
	   Cobarrubias said the two MG-520 helicopters, each carrying three
flight crewmen, had just taken off from Zamboanga's Edwin Andrews
air force base enroute to an anti-insurgency mission when the
propeller of one chopper struck the rotor blades of the other.
	   One chopper crashed on an orchid farm about five meters from a
house near a busy highway, killing its two pilots and a crewman, he
said.
	   The other plunged 150 meters away near the bank of a creek after
smashing into a mango tree in an unpopulated area, said
Cobarrubias.
	   A flight crewman was able to run away from the second chopper
while his two companions were taken out by residents. The three
sustained bruises and were being treated in a hospital.
	   Zamboanga City Mayor Maria Clara Lobregat said it was fortunate
the two choppers did not explode in the air and no one was injured
on the ground.
	   Air force officials said the collision appeared to be an
accident but they were not ruling out sabotage.
	   Zamboanga is about 850 kilometers (527 miles) south of Manila.

Colombia rebels planned to kill president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A leftist rebel group planned to
assassinate President Ernesto Samper earlier this year to refute
claims that the faction was on the decline, the guerrillas have
revealed.
	   Samper was to be attacked while visiting the contested Segovia
region along with Defense Minister Gilberto Echeverri Mejia,
according to a field commander from the National Liberation Army,
Colombia's second largest guerrilla group.
	   The rebel leader, who goes by the name Commander Julian,
disclosed the plot to reporters Friday during the rebels' release
of 15 young women hostages. His account was reported Saturday in
local newspapers.
	   The rebels interpreted Samper's visit to Segovia as an attempt
to humiliate them by implying that the region was peaceful and that
the guerrillas had been expelled, the rebel commander said.
	   ``We felt that if soldiers can die in the armed conflict, why
can't those who are responsible for the critical situation facing
Colombia die as well?,'' he said.
	   The planned assassination was aborted, he explained, because
Samper was surrounded by crowds during the visit, the exact date of
which could not be determined.
	   There was no official reaction to the rebel revelation, which
comes amid heightened peace expectations since June 21 presidential
elections.
	   Both the 5,000-member National Liberation Army and the
15,000-member Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia have said
they'll talk peace with president-elect Andres Pastrana, who
replaces Samper in August.

<TEXT>
	   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) _ Raul Diaz Arce scored twice as New England
snapped a nine-game losing skid with a 3-2 victory over Tampa Bay
in Major League Soccer Saturday night.
	   The New England forward's 13th goal, coming in the 84th minute,
capped a wild finish that featured three late goals.
	   New England (5-12) won for the first time since defeating Tampa
Bay (4-14) on May 10.
	   After Tampa Bay's Frankie Hejduk's third goal tied the match at
2-2 in the 81st minute, Diaz Arce's shot from 15 yards (13.71
meters) out barely crossed the goal line before Mutiny defender Jan
Eriksson cleared the ball.
	   Diaz Arce also scored on a penalty kick in the 75th minute.
	   Ivan McKinley's first goal put the Revolution up 1-0 in the 53rd
minute. The midfielder, who later left the match with a hamstring
injury, scored following Joe-Max Moore's free kick.
	   Tampa Bay made it 1-1 in the 60th minute on Mauricio Ramos'
second goal of the year, a shot from 25 yards (22.85 meters) out
that deflected off New England defender Manny Motajo.
 &UR; Rapids 1, MetroStars 0
	   In Denver, Marquis White scored in the 73rd minute to give the
Colorado Rapids a 1-0 victory over the New York-New Jersey
MetroStars.
	   White's game-winner came from six yards (meters) out after
defender Alexi Lalas of the MetroStars (9-8) failed to control a
cross by Rapids midfielder Christ Henderson.
	   Colorado defender Marcelo Balboa preserved the win for the
Rapids (8-9) by clearing a shot by Miles Joseph off the goal line
in the 90th minute.
	   Rapids goalkeeper Marcus Hahnemann added four saves to Balboa's
goal mouth block to earn the shutout.
 &UR; Fire 1, Burn 0
	   In Dallas, Chicago defender Lubos Kubik scored in the 37th
minute to give the Fire their 11th straight MLS victory, 1-0 over
the Dallas Burn.
	   Kubik chipped the game-winner inside the far post from 19 yards
(17.37 meters) out. It was his third career goal and all have come
against Dallas over the last three weeks.
	   He scored the lone goal in a 1-0 victory on June 17 and he
scored the first goal in a 4-1 win on July 1.
	   Goalie Zach Thornton of the Fire (13-5) registered his
league-leading sixth shutout of the season by making five saves.
	   Chad Deering, a recently signed midfielder who played for the
U.S. World Cup team, made his debut for the Burn (9-9) as a
substitute in the 59th minute.
 &UR; Galaxy 2, Wizards 0
	   In Pasadena, California, Clint Mathis scored in the first half
and Cobi Jones added a goal in the second as the Los Angeles Galaxy
won their fifth consecutive game, a 2-0 victory over the Kansas
City Wizards.
	   Goalkeeper Kevin Hartman made three saves for his third shutout
of the season.
	   Mathis' goal was from eight yards (7.31 meters) out and came on
an assist by Ezra Hendrickson. It was the lone shot of the first
half for the Galaxy (15-2), who have the league's best record.
	   Mathis also prevented a goal in the 28th minute, knocking away
Paul Rideout's header just before it entered the net after Hartman
was caught out of position.
	   In his first match since returning from playing for the U.S.
team in the World Cup, Jones put in a rebound in the 67th minute
after Carlos Hermosillo's header hit the right goal post.
	   The goal came a minute after Hartman made a save of a shot by
Paul Wright.
	   Goalkeeper Mike Ammann made three saves for Kansas City (7-10).

Chinese official denies allegations of forced organ transplants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Organ transplants in China are strictly
voluntary, a senior health official said Sunday, responding to
allegations by activist Harry Wu at a congressional hearing in
Washington.
	   China does not allow ``the organs of executed convicts to be
removed through coercive means or illicit collecting and trading in
human organs,'' the state-run Xinhua News Agency quoted the
official, whom it did not identify, as saying.
	   Trade in human organs is illegal and punished under the law, the
official said. He stated that Chinese customs officials had never
uncovered a case of human organs being transported out of the
country.
	   Wu tipped off the FBI to what he said were efforts by two
Chinese men to sell organs. The two have been accused in a U.S.
federal court of plotting to sell kidneys, corneas and lungs from
executed Chinese prisoners.
	   The Chinese health official called testimony by Wu, who has
crusaded to expose abuses at Chinese labor camps, as ``slanderous
rumors'' that were ``absolutely groundless.''
	   ``It is rare in China to use the bodies of executed convicts or
organs from an executed convict,'' the official stated. ``If there
is any, it is put under stringent state control and must go through
standard procedures.''
	   He said the organs could be used only with the voluntary
agreement and signature of the prisoners or the consent of their
relatives.
	   ``As far as organ donations are concerns, the convicts are
treated equally with other citizens,'' the official said.
	   Wu testified in June, before President Bill Clinton began his
nine-day trip to China on June 25. He spoke to an International
Relations subcommittee meeting of the House of Representatives.
	   ``Some forces hostile to China in the United States do not want
to see China grow strong and do not want to see the healthy
development of China-U.S. relations,'' Xinhua reported the health
official as saying.

Back-breaking rice sacks fuel dispute over foreign laborers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Myanmar worker Bung uses one name only &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos BK101,102 sent July 4 to Tokyo &QL; 
 &UR; By JIRAPORN WONGPAITHOON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ At rice mills around Thailand, poorly
paid laborers have to lift hundreds of 100-kilogram (220-pound)
sacks each day _ but it's the mill owners who are complaining and
causing a work stoppage.
	   Millers upset at a government ban on foreign workers launched a
protest Thursday by shutting down operations in one of the biggest
_ and oddest _ labor disputes since the Asian economic crisis
started choking Thailand a year ago.
	   They have vowed the mills will remain closed until the
government solves the problem of how to replace 20,000 foreign
workers who will be lost to the important industry. Thailand is the
world's number-one rice exporter.
	   The government decided to crack down on foreign workers last
year as economic crisis made it evident there would be layoffs in
almost every business sector. Unemployment is forecast to double to
2 million this year, about six percent of the work force.
	   The plan called for foreign workers to leave their jobs by May
1, but the deadline was extended when millers complained that Thais
could not be found to do the backbreaking labor. The government is
resisting another extension, though talks are planned next week.
	   Outside the gate of the Sukjai rice mill in Bangkok hangs a sign
advising farmers that the mill is ``not buying due to the shortage
of workers.''
	   Curiously, in view of the millers' complaints, 16 of the 20
laborers at the mill are Thai. The four foreigners come from
Myanmar, also known as Burma.
	   The owner-inspired stoppage produced a rare vacation for the
workers, who are paid minimum wage _ 165 baht (dlrs 4) a day.
Before a labor shortage in 1991, they did not get even that.
	   ``These alien workers are honest. They never refuse work, nor
request any extra welfare,'' said Somboon Pukkayaporn, 56, a mill
supervisor.
	   Bung has been working at the mill for a year. He was a farmer in
Myanmar before coming to seek work in Thailand, a magnet of
prosperity compared to its impoverished neighbors.
	   ``I do not want to be sent back to Myanmar,'' said 35-year-old
Bung. ``Working as a coolie for rice mills is tough, but I can save
some money for the future when I return to my hometown.''
	   Bung saves up to 4,800 baht (dlrs 117) a month of his 5,000 baht
(dlrs 122) base wage. He hopes to return home next April with
150,000 baht (dlrs 3,660).
	   The mill provides lodging. He scrimps on food to save money,
though his muscular frame belies hunger.
	   Bung lifts a minimum 200 sacks a day, each weighing more than
his 81 kilograms (178 pounds). For every sack above the 200 quota,
he is paid one baht (2.4 cents).
	   He earns more than 80 baht (dlrs 1.95) a day above his base
salary, meaning he's hauling almost 300 sacks _ or 30,000 kilograms
(66,000 pounds) _ a day.
	   The government this past week introduced a draft regulation to
reduce the weight of a sack to 55 kilograms (120 pounds) _ figuring
Thais would then be more likely to take mill jobs.
	   Bung prefers the heavier load.
	   ``It took me four hours, non-stop working, to finish these 200
sacks,'' said Bung. ``If a sack weighs just half, my working hours
would be doubled.''
	   Bung said lifting rice caused chest pain; dust is also a
problem. He would love an easier job but has no choice.
	   The heavy sacks have been used for years, said Kriengsak
Tapananond, a member of the millers' association.
	   ``When people from China immigrated to Thailand, they carried
sacks like this,'' Kriengsak told. ``It didn't kill them. They
became rich and prosperous.''
	   During the economic boom that crashed last year, Thais learned
to shun such labor. Even with hard times, they still do. Most of
the handful who signed up at job fairs for work at the mills
reportedly quit after a few days.
	   On Friday, Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai suggested the obvious:
mill owners should pay more and allow workers to carry less weight.
	   The millers make dire predictions that their halt of rice
purchases will hurt farmers and lead to spoilage. They claim that
600 of Thailand's estimated 12,000 mills have shut down.

	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ Two air force helicopters armed
with rockets struck each other and crashed near a southern
Philippine military air base where they took off Sunday, killing
two pilots and a crewman, officials said.
	   Three other air force crewmen were injured in the accident in
Zamboanga City, air force spokesman Lt. Col. Fredesvindo
Cobarrubias said.
	   Cobarrubias said the two MG-520 helicopters, each carrying three
flight crewmen, had just taken off from Zamboanga's Edwin Andrews
air force base enroute to an anti-insurgency mission when the
propeller of one chopper struck the rotor blades of the other.
	   ``One chopper flew very close to the other and hit its
propeller. There was no fire and they went down,'' said witness
Diosdado Jose, who was driving a motorcycle. The collision occurred
about two kilometers (1.2 miles) from the air force base.
	   One chopper crashed on an orchid farm about five meters (16
feet) from a house near a busy highway, killing its two pilots and
a crewman, he said.
	   The other plunged 150 meters (yards) away near the bank of a
creek after smashing into a mango tree in an unpopulated area,
Cobarrubias said. Part of the helicopter's tail was ripped off and
lay dangling from a branch, witnesses said.
	   A flight crewman was able to run away from the second chopper
while his two companions were taken out by residents. The three
sustained bruises and were being treated in a hospital.
	   Zamboanga City Mayor Maria Clara Lobregat said it was fortunate
the two choppers did not explode in the air and no one was injured
on the ground.
	   Air force officials said the collision appeared to be an
accident but they were not ruling out sabotage. Defense Secretary
Orlando Mercado ordered an investigation.
	   The helicopters were bound for Cotabato city in southern
Maguindanao province, where many areas have a heavy presence of
Muslim guerrillas, the air force officials said.
	   The helicopters were among about 30 acquired by the Philippines
from the U.S. military some years ago mainly for combat missions
against Marxist and Muslim guerrillas.
	   Zamboanga is about 850 kilometers (527 miles) south of Manila.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ One year after strongman Hun Sen
ousted his co-premier in a coup, opposition leaders Sunday
denounced the bloody takeover and remembered those killed in the
fighting.
	   The anniversary of the coup July 5-6, 1997, comes in the middle
of campaigning for parliamentary elections Hun Sen has set for July
26 to win back international legitimacy and aid lost after his
seizure of sole power.
	   Prince Norodom Ranariddh, the co-prime minister chased into nine
months of exile by the violence, and prominent dissident Sam Rainsy
plan separate ceremonies Monday marking the anniversary.
	   On Sunday, hundreds of people attended a rally in Phnom Penh
held by the small but respected Son Sann Party, which was part of a
coalition with Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy formed in exile before
diplomatic pressure forced Hun Sen to hold new polls.
	   Supporters carried banners reading: ``Khmer leaders must stop
using weapons to destroy people's lives'' and ``Arrest the
criminals who killed Khmer citizens during and after the coup.''
	   Motorbike drivers yelled ``Bravo! Bravo!'' as party leaders, in
a ceremony attended by 30 Buddhist monks, criticized the coup.
	   They rejected claims by Hun Sen that Ranariddh was ousted
because he had been plotting his own coup in alleged league with
former Khmer Rouge guerrillas.
	   The takeover, they said, was nothing more than a blatant grab
for power.
	   Hun Sen ``used violence, military strength in order to
consolidate his own power without taking into account the life and
happiness of the Khmer people at all,'' member Khem Sokha said.
	   Hun Sen's allegations were never proven, though Ranariddh was
convicted in a show trial in March as a precondition to letting him
return to Cambodia to contest the elections.
	   Criticism is widespread that Hun Sen has stacked the electoral
bodies in his favor, denied the opposition access to the media and
has used fear and violence to ensure he wins.
	   Memories of the coup are still fresh in the minds of many
Cambodians, especially in Phnom Penh, where tanks, mortars,
rocket-propelled grenades and automatic weapons ripped through
residential neighborhoods.
	   Hundreds of people were killed or injured in the fighting, which
also caused millions of dollars worth of damage to property. Hun
Sen's soldiers looted entire neighborhoods, the airport, factories
and businesses.
	   As many as 100 of the prince's supporters were executed in the
months that followed, according to human rights workers. There have
been no arrests for any of them.
	   In Psar Daemkor, a western suburb of Phnom Penh where fighting
and looting was heaviest, few people say they would vote for Hun
Sen but fear he might resort to fighting again should he lose.
	   ``I'm very angry,'' says Than Ritha, 46, who has an external
metal splint on her leg, a result of a shrapnel wound. ``Even if
someone has to carry me to the polling station on election day, I
will go.''
	   Ranariddh won U.N.-sponsored polls backed by thousands of
peacekeeping troops in 1993, but Hun Sen forced his way into a
tense coalition by threatening civil war. The United Nations role
this time is limited to observers and technical aid.

Opposition parties to stay in polls, leader says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Cambodia-Coup

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Two opposition parties that had
threatened to withdraw from Cambodia's elections because they would
not be free or fair have decided to stay in the race, one of their
leaders said Sunday.
	   ``We will continue the race, but we reserve the right to
withdraw if there is violence and no fairness,'' Son Soubert,
leader of the small but respected Son Sann Party, told reporters at
a rally.
	   Son Soubert said he was also speaking on behalf of prominent
dissident Sam Rainsy, who was campaigning in the eastern province
of Kompong Cham. The Sam Rainsy Party was expected to release its
own statement later in the day.
	   The leaders said last month that if minimum conditions for
democratic polls were not in place by July 5 _ the anniversary of
last year's coup by strongman Hun Sen _ they would withdraw.
	   They called for an end to threats, intimidation and killing of
opposition organizers and supporters, for access to the broadcast
media, and the right to assembly.
	   Hun Sen has been accused of all those offenses to ensure his
party wins the parliamentary polls, but the international community
has not come to the rescue of the opposition groups as they had
apparently hoped by the threat to withdraw.
	   Hun Sen's coup last year deposed his co-prime minister, Prince
Norodom Ranariddh, who is also contesting the vote. As many as 100
of his supporters were killed in the months that followed the coup.
	   Ranariddh, president of the royalist FUNCINPEC party, has in the
past aligned itself with Sam Rainsy and Son Soubert but did not
join in last month's boycott threat.

Newcastle stay top despite tie
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Penrith scrum-half Brad Drew kicked a
drop goal with a minute left to share the points with competition
leader Newcastle in their Australian rugby league clash on the
weekend.
	   Drew's kick made the score 13-13 after an under-strength
Newcastle appeared set for a narrow win.
	   The Knights remained two points clear at the top of the table as
newcomer Melbourne suffered a 34-16 loss at resurgent Brisbane.
	   Newcastle had two players, Robbie O'Davis and Wayne Richards,
banned for the maximum 22-weeks by the National Rugby League
tribunal midweek over positive drug tests and several others were
out with injuries.
	   Newcastle's English coach Mal Reilly was upset with the
performance of referee Brian Grant and let the stress of the past
week boil over in the post-match news conference.
	   ``I'm disturbed, because you have two teams who go out there and
knock themselves around, and the result is decided by the guy
without the number on his back,'' Reilly said.
	   Melbourne had enjoyed a relatively easy draw in its debut season
but ran into a determined Brisbane at ANZ Stadium. The Broncos
stormed home with three late tries, sparked when test fullback
Darren Lockyer made a 60-meter break after the home team made 24
straight tackles.
	   ``They taught us a valuable lesson tonight, you just blink and
all of a sudden they are 12 points in front,'' said Melbourne
captain and former Broncos prop Glenn Lazarus said.
	   It was the first game of a closing run into the finals in which
second-placed Melbourne also takes on heavyweights Manly, Norths,
Newcastle and Sydney City.
	   Sydney City joined Brisbane and Parramatta in joint third, one
point behind Melbourne, with an impressive 30-12 victory over
Parramatta.
	   Test lock Brad Fittler ran in two of the Roosters five tries as
the Eels slipped to a second bad loss in succession. Fittler and
scrum-half Adrian Lam combined superbly and Lam also crossed for a
brilliant try.
	   St. George lost its fourth match in the past five games,
slipping to a 11-6 record with a 34-12 loss at Manly.
	   North Sydney joined the Saints on 22 points, five behind
Newcastle, with a 32-18 win over Western Suburbs while Canberra
boosted its chances with a gutsy 16-12 win over Cronulla at Bruce
Stadium. The Sharks led 8-0 at halftime but Canberra ran in three
second-half tries including a winner from Luke Priddis.
	   Adelaide Rams christened their new home ground with a a record
52-0 win over Balmain at Hindmarsh Stadium. Graham Appo scored two
tries and kicked eight goals from nine attempts for 24 points.
	   Veteran Dale Shearer was the stand out in North Queensland's
scrappy 14-4 win over the Gold Coast, scoring a vital second-half
try, while Illawarra won 17-14 at Auckland.

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Rockets pounded the northeastern
outskirts of the Afghan capital Sunday, injuring three people _
including two children, eyewitnesses said.
	   Shrapnel from one of the five rockets wounded a father and his
child, who were sleeping in the yard when the rocket hit.
	   Another child was hurt from shrapnel elsewhere in the area,
nearby residents said. A mosque also was destroyed in the barrage.
	   The rockets were believed to have been fired by opposition
soldiers trying to hit the Kabul airport, which handles both
military and civilian aircraft.
	   Hamidullah, a shopkeeper in the area, said dozens of families
have fled the neighborhood in search of a safer area. The same
neighborhood was hit by rockets about one week ago that killed six
people.
	   An opposition alliance is waging a ferocious battle with the
Taliban religious army, which rules the capital, Kabul, and 85
percent of the country.
	   The opposition rules in the northern 15 percent of Afghanistan.
It warned earlier that it would fire rockets at the airport to try
to stop aircraft from using the facility.
	   The Taliban has imposed a strict version of Islamic law in area
under its control. It's opponents are demanding a broader-based
government.

Chaos at airport translates to higher costs for travelers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Trying to sidestep the chaos at
Malaysia's new international airport, foreign airlines and
travelers have been hit with hefty additional fees, newspapers
reported Sunday.
	   Massive systems failures at the dlrs 2.3 billion Kuala Lumpur
International Airport have caused lengthy flight delays and long
waits for baggage, cargo and taxis since the airport opened six
days ago.
	   ``We are incurring losses in the thousands because of the
problems with delayed flights,'' a spokeswoman of Austria's Lauda
Air was quoted as saying by the Star newspaper.
	   The Austrian airline, hit with delays of up to 10 hours on
flights to Austria and Australia, was forced to check passengers
into airport hotels and onto seats with competing airlines.
	   ``To ensure that passengers reach their destinations on time, we
had to pay Malaysia Airlines for connecting flights to Singapore
and then pay Singapore Airlines to send them to Melbourne,'' the
spokeswoman said, adding that most flights were delayed by problems
with check-in and baggage claims.
	   Flights were reportedly taking off on schedule early Sunday and
reports over the weekend said the computer breakdowns, caused by
faulty phone lines, would soon be improving.
	   Cargo handling at the Malaysia Airlines hangar was, however, in
disarray due to insufficient staff and incomplete facilities, said
Walter Culas, president of the Freight Forwarders Association
Malaysia.
	   ``All cargo _ inbound, outbound and transshipment items _ were
dumped on the ground floor because the top floor was not ready,''
Culas was quoted as saying in the Star. He added that many items
could not be located in the mess.
	   Culas said that the financial loss incurred could not yet be
determined.
	   Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik said the Malaysia Airlines
cargo center would temporarily stop accepting perishable goods
until the cargo could be handled faster.
	   Ling said that staff had been increased and he expected greater
efficiency within a few days.
	   Many weary passengers, after waiting up to four hours for their
bags, found long lines at the taxi stand and paid an exorbitant 300
ringgit (dlrs 80) fare to bypass the extra wait.
	   Fares from the airport, 70 kilometers (42 miles) south of the
capital, are set to cost from 55 ringgit to 88 ringgit (dlrs 14 to
dlrs 22.50) by taxi or limousine. The limo company awarded a
monopoly over the route, however, has been unable to meet the
demand.
	   Shamsul Affrin Mohd. Nor, of the Road and Transport Department,
said that action would be taken to eliminate the illegal fees.

Miners block trains on Trans-Siberian line
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Siberian coal miners blocked the Trans-Siberian
railway for a third day Sunday stranding at least 16 trains, news
reports said.
	   Several hundred miners in the western Siberian mining town of
Anzhero-Sudzhensk began the protest Friday over government plans to
close their mines and reduce subsidies to local coal-related
industries, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Trains traveling east and west on the vital rail line were
forced to make a 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) detour to avoid the
miners' blockade, the news agency said.
	   The miners are demanding that the government make good on
promises made in May to pay up to six months of back wages. They
are also demanding the resignation of President Boris Yeltsin.
	   According to ITAR-Tass, the government has paid only a seventh
of the cash they promised to deliver to end a similar rail blockade
in May.
	   Television and news agencies reported Saturday that local
workers from other industries, such as bus drivers and other
transport workers, had joined the miners' protest, bringing
Anzhero-Sudzhensk to a halt.
	   The protest comes about six weeks after a wave of protests by
coal miners around the country, who blocked the Trans-Siberian and
other railways in May to demand attention and support from the
federal government.
	   Those strikes ended when the government pledged to pay a portion
of the back wages. The Kremlin insists that the money has been paid
out, but miners' officials say only a portion has reached the
mines.
	   Russia has been slowly shutting down many of its coal mines,
which have been losing money steadily. But since many are located
in isolated regions, it has been difficult to find new employment
for the miners and workers in affiliated industries.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - An Indonesian policeman who was beaten
by pro-independence student protesters in Irian Jaya province has
died in a hospital, according to a report Sunday.
	   Sgt. Dahlan was attacked Friday during a demonstration in the
provincial capital of Jayapura, 3,700 kilometers (2,300 miles)
northeast of Jakarta.
	   Security forces shot two students during the same protest and
later apologized. Both were in critical condition, one with a
bullet wound in the head.
	   Indonesia sent troops into remote Irian Jaya, a former Dutch
colony rich in copper deposits, in 1963. Six years later, in a
U.N.-sponsored vote, people in the territory formally chose
integration with Indonesia.
	   However, many people resent Indonesian rule and a small
pro-independence rebel group called the Free West Papua Movement
still operates.

situation worse, grafs 4-5.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ One year after strongman Hun Sen
ousted his co-premier in a coup, opposition leaders Sunday
denounced the bloody takeover and said Cambodia's situation had
grown worse.
	   The anniversary of the coup July 5-6, 1997, comes in the middle
of campaigning for parliamentary elections Hun Sen has set for July
26 to win back international legitimacy and aid lost after his
seizure of sole power.
	   Prince Norodom Ranariddh, the co-prime minister chased into nine
months of exile by the violence, and prominent dissident Sam Rainsy
plan separate ceremonies Monday marking the anniversary.
	   Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC party issued a statement paying
homage to the scores of members killed and said ``certain countries
that used to be the pillars of freedom, human rights and
democracy'' have permitted Hun Sen to let the killers go
unpunished.
	   ``A year later, the balance sheet could not be worse,'' the
party said. ``There is neither political nor economic stability.''
	   Earlier, hundreds of people attended a rally in Phnom Penh held
by the small but respected Son Sann Party, which was part of a
coalition with Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy formed in exile before
diplomatic pressure forced Hun Sen to hold new polls.
	   Supporters carried banners reading: ``Khmer leaders must stop
using weapons to destroy people's lives'' and ``Arrest the
criminals who killed Khmer citizens during and after the coup.''
	   Motorbike drivers yelled ``Bravo! Bravo!'' as party leaders, in
a ceremony attended by 30 Buddhist monks, criticized the coup.
	   They rejected claims by Hun Sen that Ranariddh was ousted
because he had been plotting his own coup in alleged league with
former Khmer Rouge guerrillas.
	   The takeover, they said, was nothing more than a blatant grab
for power.
	   Hun Sen ``used violence, military strength in order to
consolidate his own power without taking into account the life and
happiness of the Khmer people at all,'' member Khem Sokha said.
	   Hun Sen's allegations were never proven, though Ranariddh was
convicted in a show trial in March as a precondition to letting him
return to Cambodia to contest the elections.
	   Criticism is widespread that Hun Sen has stacked the electoral
bodies in his favor, denied the opposition access to the media and
has used fear and violence to ensure he wins.
	   Memories of the coup are still fresh in the minds of many
Cambodians, especially in Phnom Penh, where tanks, mortars,
rocket-propelled grenades and automatic weapons ripped through
residential neighborhoods.
	   Hundreds of people were killed or injured in the fighting, which
also caused millions of dollars worth of damage to property. Hun
Sen's soldiers looted entire neighborhoods, the airport, factories
and businesses.
	   As many as 100 of the prince's supporters were executed in the
months that followed, according to human rights workers. There have
been no arrests for any of them.
	   In Psar Daemkor, a western suburb of Phnom Penh where fighting
and looting was heaviest, few people say they would vote for Hun
Sen but fear he might resort to fighting again should he lose.
	   ``I'm very angry,'' says Than Ritha, 46, who has an external
metal splint on her leg, a result of a shrapnel wound. ``Even if
someone has to carry me to the polling station on election day, I
will go.''
	   Ranariddh won U.N.-sponsored polls backed by thousands of
peacekeeping troops in 1993, but Hun Sen forced his way into a
tense coalition by threatening civil war. The United Nations role
this time is limited to observers and technical aid.

Opposition parties to stay in polls despite doubts of fairness
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with joint statement by
opposition leaders &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Cambodia-Coup

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Two opposition parties that had
threatened to withdraw from Cambodia's elections announced Sunday
they would stay in the race, even though they still believe the
polls will not be free or fair.
	   Party leaders Sam Rainsy and Son Soubert said in a statement the
decision was ``very difficult'' and they reserved the right to pull
out later if conditions deteriorated, but withdrawing now would
betray their loyalists.
	   ``Unfortunately, political violence appears to be on the rise,''
said the pair, respectively leaders of the Sam Rainsy Party and the
Son Sann Party. ``A free and fair election cannot take place under
these conditions.''
	   Media access remains restricted, strongman Hun Sen's ruling
Cambodian People's Party has hijacked key legal institutions and
many Cambodians were unable to register to vote in the July 26
polls, they said.
	   The leaders said last month that if minimum conditions for
democratic polls were not in place by July 5 _ the anniversary of
last year's coup by strongman Hun Sen _ they would withdraw.
	   Hun Sen has been accused of rigging the polls, but the
international community has not come to the rescue of the
opposition groups as they had apparently hoped in threatening to
withdraw.
	   Hun Sen's coup last year deposed his co-prime minister, Prince
Norodom Ranariddh, who is also contesting the vote.
	   In the past, Ranariddh, president of the royalist FUNCINPEC
party, has aligned itself with Sam Rainsy and Son Soubert, but he
did not join in last month's boycott threat.

Mexican government cracking down on rebel villages

<TEXT>
	   MORELIA, Mexico (AP) _ The biggest thing in this little village
is a sprawling rebel meeting center: a scattering of clapboard
buildings on the edge of town with a lurid painting of
revolutionary icon Emiliano Zapata.
	   The work that went into building the center three years ago
testifies to the support the leftist Zapatista National Liberation
Army enjoyed after its January 1994 uprising.
	   But only a handful of people now can be seen on the center's
grassy grounds. The wood on the buildings is starting to age.
Crooked doors hang open.
	   In Morelia itself, dozens of villagers are having second
thoughts about the rebellion _ apparently due to weariness with the
conflict as well as government efforts to erode the rebels' base of
support.
	   Late in May, 69 people signed a letter to Chiapas Gov. Roberto
Albores Guillen announcing they no longer oppose the federal
government.
	   ``We now repent and recognize our errors in the past,'' they
said.
	   It was perhaps the most significant government triumph in a
campaign trying to stamp out some 35 rebel self-governments created
since 1995 in the remote, rugged canyons of Mexico's southernmost
state.
	   In recent weeks, the government has produced similar petitions
from several other Zapatista strongholds.
	   It has taken a tougher line elsewhere. There have been four
raids by hundreds of soldiers and police on similar towns.
Pro-Zapatista local leaders were arrested on charges of usurping
government functions. Early in June, eight villagers and two
policemen died when Zapatistas resisted government forces raiding
villages in the El Bosque area.
	   The rebels call the self-rule villages ``autonomous
municipalities'' and reject state officials' authority.
	   Government officials are using carrots and sticks to try to
isolate the Zapatistas and force them to resume direct peace talks
on government terms.
	   For instance, aid programs are being increased for villagers
willing to work with representatives of the authorities.
	   The army, meanwhile, has tens of thousands of soldiers in the
rebel region.
	   Rebel sympathizers from outside who once poured into the area
now face checkpoints where officials inspect documents. More than
100 foreign ``human rights observers,'' mostly Zapatista
sympathizers, have been expelled for violating their visas or for
allegedly meddling in politics.
	   Following months of high-level official criticism, Roman
Catholic Bishop Samuel Ruiz quit as the conflict's main mediator.
The government accused him of a pro-rebel bias.
	   Morelia's pro-rebel reputation came hard. Human rights groups
accused troops of raping three village women and killing several
villagers taken for interrogation during the two weeks of heavy
fighting at the start of the Zapatista uprising in 1994.
	   In February 1995, villagers fled into the hills when troops
briefly pushed into Zapatista territory.
	   Soon afterward, the government passed a law declaring the
Zapatistas a legal political movement to smooth the way for peace
talks. But the rebels have remained armed and wary, and talks have
been suspended since late 1996, increasingly frustrating national
officials.
	   Morelia residents are wary of explaining their change of mind _
whether out of mistrust of outsiders or concern over the
rifle-toting Zapatista fighters who trudge past the chickens on the
village's dirt paths.
	   A score of men in front of the town's farm hall hushed one
another when a few started to explain to a reporter. None would
give his name. But they insisted the letter to the governor was
genuine.
	   ``There were a lot of problems,'' said one. ``The government is
promising a project.''
	   ``What we want is to be at peace,'' he added, before warning
glances silenced him.
	   A Zapatista activist in town, who also nervously declined to
give a name, insisted some of those who signed the document were
underage or from outside the village. Others, he said, had always
been supporters of the government.
	   The men at the farm hall denied those claims.
	   The activist said the government was buying support by offering
to acquire land on the outskirts of town for a cattle project and
by donating a truck to the farm union and food to friendly
villagers.
	   He said Zapatistas would not accept government control.
Referring to the recent clash at El Bosque, he added, ``If the
government continues to spill blood, we will spill some.''

Distraught mother hurls baby to death from hospital building
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A distraught mother unable to pay
medical bills for her baby hurled the 2-month-old girl to her death
from the fourth floor of a hospital.
	   Thai newspapers reported Sunday that Prayoon Improm, 23, was
then prevented from leaping to her own death by hospital staff.
	   ``I just had nobody to turn to,'' Prayoon told police, according
to the Bangkok Post. ``No relatives contacted me. So I decided to
kill my baby and myself.''
	   Prayoon took her daughter to Bangkok's public King Mongkut
Hospital for treatment for a heart defect three weeks ago but grew
increasingly worried about paying at least 10,000 baht (dlrs 238)
of the uncovered costs.
	   She told police after Saturday's tragedy that she had not seen
her husband, Worathep Hormthip, since his employers refused several
days ago to advance his salary to help pay the bills.

Two men killed in fire, explosion on oil rig
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUNDEE, Scotlaned (AP) _ Two welders were killed in a fire and
explosion as they carried out repairs to an oil rig in Dundee
harbor, police said Sunday.
	   The men, aged 56 and 40, were working in a confined space at the
foot of one of the Arctic 4's giant legs when fire broke out around
10 p.m. (2100 GMT) on Saturday, said a spokesman for Tayside police
said, speaking with customary anonymity.
	   ``There was a fire followed by a small explosion and smoke was
seen coming out of the base of the leg,'' the spokesman said.
	   Firefighters had to climb down a series of ladders inside the
leg to reach the scene of the fire, which was quickly extinguished.
Neither of the men has been identified.
	   The rig, owned by Global Marine, had been in Dundee for about a
week for welding and repainting work.
	   The government's Health and Safety Executive is investigating.

Police detain 200 in Chechen crime crackdown
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Police in Chechnya detained more than 200 people
for curfew violations over the weekend during a state of emergency
declared to stem a wave of lawlessness in the separatist republic,
a news agency said Sunday.
	   Four kidnappers were arrested and their hostage released
Saturday night during a road check, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
Another seven people who were on Chechnya's most wanted list were
taken into custody.
	   Police detained the drivers of eight heavy trucks carrying
stolen oil, the report said. Six of the trucks were destroyed on
the spot after the drivers resisted police, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Law enforcement officials also seized 18 Kalashnikov submachine
guns from curfew violators who did not have permits for the
weapons.
	   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov announced the state of
emergency June 23 to help police carry out their anti-crime
campaign. A curfew is in effect daily from 10 p.m. 6 a.m.
	   Chechnya has become a center of violent crime, including
kidnappings and rampant shootings, since the end of its
independence war against Russia two years ago.
	   No one is exempt from the curfew, Maskhadov's spokesman Malbek
Vachachayev told ITAR-Tass.
	   The presidential motorcade attempted to pass through a roadblock
Saturday night with some ``hotheads'' in the security detail
refusing to show their identification, Vachachayev said.
	   He said thanks to efficient actions by officers manning the
roadblock, they were able to stop the motorcade, and Maskhadov had
to show his special pass. The president praised the officers for
their work, Vachachayev said.

World Cup: Bergkamp a champ as Dutch eye the championship
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY WILNER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ He is the classic finisher, and Dennis
Bergkamp plans to finish off what the Dutch have started in the
World Cup.
	   ``We want to go all the way,'' said Bergkamp, whose magnificent
goal Saturday with 32 seconds remaining in regulation time lifted
the Netherlands past Argentina 2-1. ``We've tasted a bit of success
and we want more.''
	   They'll have to do it the hard way, playing defending champion
Brazil, the four-time cup holder, in the semifinals Tuesday in
Marseille. But of the three teams remaining along with the
Brazilians, the Dutch appear most capable of an upset.
	   They have an aggressive style that is a must against Brazil.
Backing off against the champions means certain doom.
	   They have a midfield that moves the ball quickly to the
attackers. And they have a finally healthy Bergkamp to score goals.
	   ``It's all about luck as well as finishing,'' said Bergkamp,
whose goal Saturday was his 36th in international competition, a
Dutch record. ``You've got to have those moments.
	   ``You win and you move on. You don't think about losing.''
	   The Dutch are thinking about winning their first world
championship _ they reached the title games in 1974 and 1978,
losing both to the host countries, West Germany and Argentina. To
do it, Bergkamp must continue at the level he's shown in the last
two games.
	   The tournament did not start out well for the Arsenal star, who
helped his club to England's Premier League championship and the FA
Cup crown. He missed six weeks with a hamstring injury and was not
at full strength for the opener.
	   Bergkamp came on midway through the second half of a lackluster
0-0 tie with Belgium. When Patrick Kluivert received a two-game
suspension for elbowing a Belgian defender, coach Guus Hiddink was
forced to start Bergkamp against South Korea, regardless of
Bergkamp's condition.
	   That game wasn't a big challenge.
	   ``The Koreans let us play, and we had much room to use our
attack and do what we do best,'' Bergkamp said. ``It was not very
stressful.''
	   As he began rounding into top shape, Bergkamp also found he was
getting the ball more. He didn't score against Mexico, but in a 2-1
second-round win against Yugoslavia, Bergkamp connected once more,
tying the Dutch career scoring mark in international games set by
Faas Wilkes.
	   Against Argentina, he made a great head pass to Kluivert to set
up the first goal. Then he won it on the kind of spectacular play
that doesn't happen often enough in the World Cup _ but just might
when the Dutch and Brazilians get together.
	   Frank de Boer sent an arcing pass from midfield that Bergkamp
took off his right foot on the fly. He made a nifty move around
Argentina's top defender, Roberto Ayala, and then flicked a
right-footed shot into the corner of the net.
	   ``It was a great pass from Frank in the back and I went into
space,'' he said. ``I knew if we kept the pressure on their
defense, something good would come for us. It did.''
	   Bergkamp believes the best is yet to come for the Netherlands.
	   ``To win the World Cup is every player's dream,'' he said. ``We
have put ourselves in the position to do it, and we are confident
that we can.''

Survey: Swiss support trade complaint over sanctions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ The Swiss favor diplomatic moves to
head off U.S. threats of sanctions against Swiss banks but would
back a protest to the World Trade Organization over any boycott,
according to a survey published Sunday.
	   In the poll of 605 people, carried out by the Isopublic research
institute, 61.2 percent said Switzerland should file a complaint
with the WTO over U.S. sanctions. Some 23 percent opposed such a
move.
	   New York City and state on Thursday turned up the pressure over
deadlocked talks between Swiss commercial banks, Jewish groups and
lawyers for Holocaust survivors by announcing plans to withhold
business from the banks and, if no solution is found, from other
Swiss firms. Other states also have announced plans for sanctions.
	   Last month, the banks offered dlrs 600 million for a settlement
of claims by Holocaust survivors. Jewish leaders claimed that was
far less than the more than dlrs 1 billion the banks should be
paying.
	   Switzerland's government has said it would support Swiss firms
if they take legal steps against any sanctions.
	   ``A decision should be made soon'' on whether to go ahead with a
complaint to the WTO, Swiss President Flavio Cotti was quoted as
saying in the Zurich weekly SonntagsBlick.
	   The trade body can require member countries to honor their
commitment to global trading rules.
	   The survey, published in SonntagsBlick and the Lausanne daily Le
Matin, showed a clear majority against counter-sanctions by
Switzerland and Swiss firms.
	   Some 66 percent of those questioned were against the idea, with
25 percent in favor.
	   They favored diplomatic moves to end the crisis by 69.5 percent
to 18.8 percent.
	   The poll showed only 7.9 percent believing the banks should
raise their settlement offer to head off sanctions. Some 59.2 said
the current offer should stand, while 22.8 percent said the offer
should be withdrawn altogether.
	   Meanwhile, 42.4 percent said payments from a Swiss fund to help
needy Holocaust victims should be stopped. Fifty percent opposed
that idea.
	   No margin of error was given for the survey, carried out Friday
and Saturday.

Extradition of alleged Indonesian pirates could take one year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The extradition of 12 Indonesians
held by China for the April hijacking of a Malaysian-registered oil
tanker could take up to a year, a Malaysian newspaper reported
Sunday.
	   Malaysia and China have an extradition treaty, and the Malaysian
government has notified Beijing that the Indonesians were being
sought on charges of armed robbery and hijacking of the vessel, the
Petro Ranger, which was discovered in Chinese waters on April 26.
	   ``From the way things are moving, we think that the pirates will
only be brought back next year,'' the newspaper The Star quoted a
police official as saying.
	   The official added that Malaysian authorities had submitted
their request several weeks ago to the Chinese government but
``until now have yet to obtain the pirates' names.''
	   The Petro Ranger and its 21-member crew were released May 30
after a Chinese investigation, but there has been no word about
charging the Indonesians accused of hijacking the vessel.
	   The Petro Ranger disappeared for nine days after setting sail
from Singapore to Ho Chi Minh City on April 17. It carried 11,000
tons of diesel and kerosene, worth an estimated dlrs 1.5 million.
	   Neither the ship's Singapore-based agent nor the Chinese
authorities have said what happened to the cargo.

Singapore launches courtesy campaign amid greater economic fears
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JONATHAN DRAKE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore hasn't relented in its efforts to
mold a more courteous society even as rising unemployment and the
threat of recession might seem like cause for grumbling.
	   Launched in 1979 by then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, the annual
National Courtesy Campaign has instructed Singaporeans over the
years to be more civic minded in just about every conceivable way.
	   This year, campaign leaders say the Asian economic crisis makes
civic behavior especially important.
	   ``If a person has lost his job or is in between jobs, if he has
friendly neighbors to help lend a hand, psychologically, that will
support him,'' The Sunday Times quoted Courtesy Council chief Noel
Hon as saying.
	   While officially launching the latest courtesy program Saturday,
Finance Minister Richard Hu said that ``this is an important time
for all of us to help each other through courteous and neighborly
acts to alleviate the socio-economic challenges we may face.''
	   Over the years, the government-run campaign has encouraged
traditional politeness, from smiling more often and saying
``please'' to holding doors open for strangers and keeping the
volume down in your apartment.
	   It has also focused on more modern and specific irritants, such
as pagers and mobile phones ringing in theaters and churches, poor
bedside manners in hospitals, and rude or vulgar language on the
Internet.
	   The monthlong campaign is typical of Singapore's numerous _ some
say lecturing and condescending _ public drives to instill certain
values and behavior in its 3.1 million citizens.
	   There have been separate campaigns against drugs, to save water,
be more punctual, exercise more, stop making nuisance emergency
calls, speak Mandarin instead of Chinese dialects, and even _
during a 1967 rice shortage _ to eat more wheat.

Outgoing U.S. Ambassador Jean Kennedy Smith to be made honorary
</HEADLINE>
Irish citizen &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Outgoing U.S. Ambassador Jean Kennedy
Smith is to be made an honorary Irish citizen, a rare tribute that
honors her ``immense service to Ireland,'' including her work for
peace in Northern Ireland, the Irish government said.
	   Prime Minister Bertie Ahern announced the honor Saturday night
at a party in Dublin marking American Independence Day and the end
of Mrs. Kennedy Smith's five-year term.
	   Ahern said people across the country saluted the ambassador for
her support for the Northern Ireland peace deal, forged in April,
that has set up a compromise government in the troubled province.
News reports said the U.S. envoy had stepped in several times to
help to advance often difficult peace talks.
	   Earlier this year, Ahern praised the ambassador for helping to
get a U.S. visa in 1994 for Sinn Fein party leader Gerry Adams,
whose party is allied with the Irish Republican Army.
	   ``It is not an understatement to say that if that didn't happen
at the time, perhaps other events may not have fallen into place,''
Ahern said.
	   But Raymond Seitz, cormer U.S. ambassador in London, accused
Mrs. Kennedy Smith, sister of the late President John F. Kennedy
and Sen. Edward Kennedy, of being of being an ``ardent apologist''
for the IRA.
	   In his memoirs published in January, Seitz said: ``It became
obvious she wanted to promote the reunification of both parts of
Ireland, even if one of the parts happened to lie in the United
Kingdom.''
	   Seitz, siding with the British government, had urged the White
House not to grant Adams a visa in 1994.
	   In December, Mrs. Kennedy Smith risked controversy by taking
communion in a Protestant cathedral in Dublin, going against the
bishops of her Roman Catholic church.
	   Her decision was a strong personal gesture of support for Irish
President Mary McAleese, who had been criticized by Irish bishops
for joining in a Protestant communion service.
	   Mrs. Kennedy Smith was due to complete her ambassadorial duties
at the weekend and will vacate her official residence in Dublin's
Phoenix Park in the coming week.

 &UR; From paradise to endangered species _ the future of small islands
in debate &QL; 
 &UR; By SUSAN LINNEE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LE REDUIT, Mauritius (AP) _ Long considered idyllic places to
escape the stress of life in industrialized societies, small
islands are struggling today to remain ecologically, culturally and
economically afloat as technology reduces distance, and the world
closes in.
	   The problems range from too many tourists and too much garbage
to the devastating effects on fat-laden fast food on the health of
Pacific islanders and the dearth of home-grown biologists and
taxonomists to catalogue endemic fauna and flora in an attempt to
protect them.
	   With no ready-made solutions to offer, but motivated by the
desire to share ideas and concerns, some 100 academics, researchers
and assorted island-lovers spent four days on Mauritius _ a small
island in the western Indian Ocean east of Madagascar _ discussing
everything from the danger of rising seas to whether it was
possible to stop a Malaysian developper from building an Asian
theme park on a tiny Caribbean island.
	   Puksu Igualikinya, a leader of the Kuna indian community from
the San Blas archhipelago off Panama, met Randy Thaman, a former
Peace Corps volunteer from northern California who teaches Pacific
Islands biogeography at the University of the South Pacific in Fiji
_ his home for the past 25 years.
	   And Christine McMurray, a specialist in development health from
the Australian National University, compared notes with Shunsuke
Nagashima of Japan's Nara Women's University, whose aim is to visit
all the small islands of the world. He's not sure how many there
are, but he has been to 1,600 so far.
	   The conference on the biosphere in Rio de Janeiro in 1992
officially put small islands on the map of international concern.
Since then, there have been more U.N. or government-sponsored
gatherings on specific island topics like waste management or
development.
	   But scholars and academics, like those who attended the July 1-5
Islands 5 gathering, have been getting together informally to talk
about small islands since 1984 when they first met on Vancouver
Island.
	   ``A lot of the information you get and the papers presented at
these conferences are now available on the Internet, but that is no
substitute for meeting people and sitting down over a beer to talk
things over,'' Thaman said.
	   There is no hard and fast rule on what constitutes a small
island, although population _ usually a maximum 1.5 million _ has
been one parameter. Some economists argue that Greenland, although
huge, is essentially a small island because of its tiny population
that lives basically off limited coastal resources.
	   In the middle of the myriad problems facing small islands, the
Internet has emerged as a formidable vehicle through which to
exchange information and ideas on possible solutions.
	   In 1997, the Island Web Consortium was set up as a non-profit
organization through which small islanders can use the World Wide
Web to access information.
	   Peter Meincke of Canada's Prince Edward Island University said
the IWC made it possible for someone on an small Irish island to
inquire about wind generators in the Falkland Islands where they
have been used successfully for years. The information was then
posted on several websites linked to one of the consortium's four
main gates.
	   The windswept Falklands, a British terrtiory in the South
Atlantic inhabited by about 2,000 people and millions of penguins,
have only recently been connected to the Internet.
	   Some conference participants said there were too many themes
introduced in the sessions that ran from the need to protect the
biodiversity of small islands to the role of literature in
expressing cultural identity to the dangers of overdependence on
offshore finance operations.
	   But Cristian Suteanu of the Center for Complexity Studies in
Bucharest, Romania, liked the potpourri.
	   ``I'm interested in international and interdisciplinary
dialogue, so this is just the place for me,'' said the editor of
Paideusis, an on-line ``meeting place for searchers and
researchers.''
	   At a final meeting Saturday, participants approved a declaration
on island biodiversity and issued recommendations ``to help small
islands meet the challenges of the new millenium and achieve
sustainability.''
	   The International Small Islands Studies Association _ formed at
a previous meeting in Okinawa in 1994 _ convened the Mauritius
conference and will co-host a subsequent meeting, likely to be held
in the Azores in 2000.

Survey: Swiss support trade complaint over sanctions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ The Swiss favor diplomatic moves to
head off U.S. threats of sanctions against Swiss banks but would
back a protest to the World Trade Organization over any American
boycott, according to a survey published Sunday.
	   In the poll of 605 people, carried out by the Isopublic research
institute, 61.2 percent said Switzerland should file a complaint
with the WTO over planned U.S. sanctions. Some 23 percent opposed
such a move.
	   New York City and state on Thursday turned up the pressure over
deadlocked talks between Swiss commercial banks, Jewish groups and
lawyers for Holocaust survivors by announcing plans to withhold
business from the banks and, if no solution is found, from other
Swiss firms. Other states also have announced plans for sanctions.
	   Last month, the banks offered dlrs 600 million for a settlement
of claims by Jewish survivors of Nazi genocide. Jewish leaders
claimed that was far less than the more than dlrs 1 billion the
banks should be paying.
	   Switzerland's government has said it would support Swiss firms
if they take legal steps against any sanctions.
	   ``A decision should be made soon'' on whether to go ahead with a
complaint to the WTO, Swiss President Flavio Cotti was quoted as
saying in the Zurich weekly SonntagsBlick.
	   The trade body can require member countries to honor their
commitment to global trading rules.
	   The survey, published in SonntagsBlick and the Lausanne daily Le
Matin, showed a clear majority against counter-sanctions by
Switzerland and Swiss firms.
	   Some 66 percent of those questioned were against the idea, with
25 percent in favor.
	   They favored diplomatic moves to end the crisis by 69.5 percent
to 18.8 percent.
	   The poll showed only 7.9 percent believing the banks should
raise their settlement offer to head off sanctions. Some 59.2 said
the current offer should stand, while 22.8 percent said the offer
should be withdrawn altogether.
	   Meanwhile, 42.4 percent said payments from a Swiss fund to help
needy Holocaust victims should be stopped. Fifty percent opposed
that idea.
	   No margin of error was given for the survey, carried out Friday
and Saturday.

	   LE REDUIT, Mauritius (AP) _ At the end of a July 1-5 conference
on small islands and the challenge of the third millenium, the
International Small Islands Studies Association issued two
non-binding declarations _ the Mauritius Declaration and a
Declaration on Island Biodiversity.
	   Among recommendations in the Mauritus Declaration are:
	   _ that small islands diversify their economies to reduce high
dependence on one dominant product or industry, like tourism;
	   _ that small islands adopt an integrated coastal zone management
strategy for the sustainable use of coastal zone resources,
including coral reefs, not only for the benefit of tourists but
also ``for their inherent biological worth'';
	   _ that small islands adopt the internatioanl Island Systems
Management Strategy to take into account interactions of various
eco-systems, development plans and available resources;
	   _ that all those interested in the welfare of small islands
promote the use of the Internet and the World Wide Web to support
sustainable development.
	   In addition, the ISISA declared on biodiversity:
	   ``If action is not taken now _ internationally, nationally, and,
most importantly, at the community or resource owner and user
levels, to address this situation (of endangered biodiversity), the
richness of small island cultures and the current state of relative
economic well-being and `subsistence affluence' and peacefulness,
so often associated with small islands, will be replaced by
widespread biological, economic and cultural poverty in the 21st
century.''

Bulldogs back on top
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Brett Montgomery kicked three late
goals as Western Bulldogs bounced back from two straight losses to
reclaim the lead in the Australian Football League competition on
the weekend.
	   Montgomery's late surge helped the Bulldogs to a 12.11 (83) to
9.11 (65) victory over Melbourne after the Demons had led narrowly
for the first three quarters.
	   The Bulldogs went ahead of St. Kilda on percentages after the
Saints' were thrashed by 66-points against North Melbourne.
	   North captain Wayne Carey was in outstanding form as his side
showed it was back in premiership contention after a slow start.
Carey had 14 marks and 26 possessions, kicked six goals and easily
bettered five opponents.
	   North coach Denis Pagan said Carey played with Achilles, hip and
groin injuries.
	   West Coast continued its strong mid-season run, winning its
seventh from eight games with a 27-point win at Brisbane.
	   The Eagles kept the Lions goalless from midway through the
second term to midway through the last in their 11.10 (76) to 6.13
(49) win.
	   Richmond consolidated its place in the top four with a 62-point
win over Carlton at the MCG.
	   The Tigers' 20.12 (132) to 11.4 (70) victory was their ninth in
15 games. Carlton kicked the first four goals of the match, but
failed to score in the second quarter.
	   Sydney forward Tony Lockett celebrated his 250th game with a
matchwinning performance in the Swans' first victory over Fremantle
in Perth. Lockett kicked six goals in a 13.4 (82) to 10.9 (69)
victory.
	   Collingwood stayed on track for the finals with a 10-point upset
of Geelong at the MCG.
	   The Magpies, without star player Nathan Buckley, won 10.11 (71)
to 9.7 (61) in driving rain.
	   Adelaide also triumphed in wet conditions against Hawthorn at
Football Park, winning 9.14 (68) to 4.11 (35), as the reigning
premier cemented itself in third spot.
	   Essendon edged a spot closer to the top eight when it beat Port
Adelaide at the MCG, securing a comfortable 16.12 (108) to 12.9
(81) victory.

Party atmosphere takes hold as Hong Kong bids farewell to Kai Tak

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Thousands of people, many bringing children and
most carrying cameras, jammed downtown Kai Tak airport Sunday,
turning its final day of operation into an impromptu festival
celebrating a unique 73-year history.
	   The last flight, a London-bound Cathay Pacific jumbo jet, was to
leave shortly before midnight. Hong Kong's top civil servant, Chief
Secretary Anson Chan, was to turn out the lights at about 1 a.m.,
officially retiring Kai Tak.
	   New, dlrs 20 billion Chek Lap Kok airport, on an outlying island
30 kilometers (22 miles) to the west, opens Monday morning.
	   While there has been a broad consensus for years that something
needed to be done about crowded, noisy Kai Tak, Hong Kong was
having a hard time letting go. Some Hong Kong residents and
frequent visitors said they planned trips especially to use the
airport, with its roof-skimming approaches over crowded Kowloon and
takeoff over Kowloon Bay.
	   ``This is a mess,'' 19-year-old student Jenny Chung said of Kai
Tak. ``But it is a unique mess.''
	   Chung, who was flying to Vancouver Sunday, and her family were
among the many people posing for pictures at an airport sign
outside the terminal.
	   A spokeswoman, Mandy Tsoi, said workers had started moving
equipment at 8:30 a.m. (0030 GMT) Sunday, and that dozens of road
shipments had been made. Three barges also had been shipped off to
Chek Lap Kok.
	   About 30 planes were to make a 15-minute flight from the old
airport to the new one.
	   Officials previously had said the only thing that could delay
the transfer was a typhoon. Thunderstorms and possibly heavy rain
were forecast, but it was not expected to affect the schedule.
	   On Sunday, TV footage showed workers buffing the marble floors
of the new airport, said to still be too shiny, and putting final
touches on retail stores.
	   Construction of the massive airport _ about the size of London's
Heathrow airport _ involved flattening two islets and pushing back
the sea to accommodate two runways. The airport project includes a
1,363-meter (4,475-foot)-long suspension bridge, an express highway
and a railway to link the remote airport to downtown.
	   Inside Kai Tak's crowded, old terminal, parents were looking
around with their children, and nearly everyone, it appeared, had a
camera. Police had closed off the top two floors of a parking
garage that is a favorite spot for taking pictures of planes coming
in low over Hong Kong. However, photographers jammed the lower
floors, and every landing was accompanied by the click of shutters
and exclamations.
	   Samuel Law, a 33-year-old photographer, and Lily Leung, a
secretary, said they were flying to Seoul, South Korea, Sunday to
use Kai Tak one more time. They planned to return in five days,
using the new airport.
	   ``It's like sending off an old friend,'' Law said.
	   Jacqueline Har, a flight attendant for Hong Kong-based Cathay
Pacific, said the new airport was bigger and clearly has better
facilities, but that she will miss Kai Tak.
	   ``I'm so thrilled every time I land here, even though I've been
doing it for four years,'' she said.
	   The new airport has been marred by controversy. First announced
in 1989 to boost people's confidence amid political uncertainty and
an economic downturn, the massive project was denounced by the
Chinese, who accused the British of draining Hong Kong's coffers
before they turned the territory over to China on July 1, 1997.
	   Disputes over funding, and a delay in the completion of the
airport railway, delayed the opening by about a year.
	   On Thursday, Chinese President Jiang Zemin dedicated Chek Lap
Kok airport before becoming the first passenger to leave from it.
Hours later, U.S. President Bill Clinton became the first one to
land there.

New yokozuna Wakanohana wins opening bout
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAGOYA, Japan (AP) _ Wakanohana made his debut as a yokozuna
(grand champion) Sunday with a victory on the opening day of the
15-day Nagoya Grand Sumo Tournament.
	   Wakanohana gained promotion to sumo's highest rank by winning
the last two tournaments, with a 14-1 record in March and 12-3 in
May.
	   Seeking his third title in a row, and sixth overall, he fought
off No. 2 maegashira (senior wrestler) Musoyama's hand thrusts,
charged him with an arm throw attempt and drove him out.
	   His younger brother, Takanohana, seeking his 19th title, drove
out No. 1 maegashira Oginishiki.
	   The two are the first brothers ever to hold yokozuna rank at the
same time. Takanohana has been a yokozuna since 1994.
	   Wakanohana's promotion also meant there were three yokozunas in
a tournament for the first time since the 1991 Nagoya Grand
Tournament.
	   The third yokozuna, Hawaii-born yokozuna Akebono, who has won
nine tournaments, held off komusubi (junior champion second class)
Kaio's pulling attempt and sent him out. Akebono, or Chad Rowan,
finished the previous tournament in Tokyo at 10-5.
	   Ozeki (champion) Musashimaru held off No. 1 maegashira
Takatoriki's pulling attempts and drove him out. Musashimaru, or
Fiamalu Penitani from Hawaii, also finished at 10-5 at the previous
tournament.
	   Ozeki Takanonami grabbed No. 2 maegashira Tochinonada's belt and
sent him out.
	   No. 11 maegashira Kyokushuzan, or Mongolian Batbayar Davaa, was
thrust out by No. 12 maegashira Asanosho. Kyokushuzan was promoted
to his present rank from No. 13 maegashira for a 9-6 record in May.
	   No. 15 maegashira Kyokutenho, or Mongolian Tsevegnyam Nyamjav,
was forced out by No. 14 maegashira Dewaarashi.
	   Kyokutenho was promoted to his present rank from No. 1 in the
juryo division, just below the makuuchi senior division, with an
8-7 record.
	   In makushita, the top junior division, No. 16-ranked Kaishinzan,
or American Henry Armstrong Miller, was crushed down by equally
ranked Tominagayama.
	   Kaishinzan finished the last tournament at 6-1 and advanced to
his present rank from No. 36.
	   In sandanme, the second-highest junior division, No. 65-ranked
Azumakaze, or Brazilian Tussato Guiuliano Kotinda, forced down
equally ranked Yoshigatake.
	   Azumakaze moved up 17 ranks to his present rank with a 4-3
record.
	   Wrestlers in junior divisions have only seven bouts during the
15-day tournament.

Bus crashes in southern France, 15 Spaniards injured
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ A bus carrying Spanish workers on their
way home collided with a car full of Moroccan citizens Sunday,
injuring 15 of the Spanish passengers.
	   Five of the injured were in serious condition following the
crash which took place shortly before 1 a.m. (1100 GMT) between the
cities of Toulouse and Bayonne, just north of the border with
Spain.
	   Police said the accident occurred when the car tried to pass the
bus but swung back into the right lane and smashed into the bus
before it had completely overtaken the bigger vehicle.
	   The bus then swerved into a ditch and overturned.
	   French authorities evacuated the injured by helicopter.
	   The Spanish passengers had been working in Switzerland and were
on their way to their homes in Galicia in northwestern Spain.
	   The Moroccans, traveling in a station wagon, were also heading
home to their country via Spain.
	   An investigation is underway.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Jordan's
King Hussein and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat met Sunday for
talks on stalled Mideast peace negotiations.
	   The three leaders are also expected to discuss Israeli plans to
expand the borders of Jerusalem and the recent confrontation
between Israeli and Palestinian troops in the Gaza Strip over
access to a road.
	   Israel's decision to extend municipal services to West Bank
Jewish settlements has angered Palestinians who accuse Israel of
violating the Israel-Palestinian peace accords by unilaterally
expanding Jerusalem's borders.
	   The plan, approved June 21 by the Israeli Cabinet, also calls
for the annexation of Jewish suburbs inside Israel to ensure
Jerusalem's Jewish majority of 70 percent.
	   The Arab leaders were also to discuss Israel's rejection of a
U.S. proposal that calls on Israel to withdraw from another 13 per
cent of the West Bank. The Palestinians have accepted the proposal
that aims at restarting peace talks which have been stalled since
March 1997 when Israel began building a Jewish housing unit in Arab
east Jerusalem. Palestinians want to make east Jerusalem the
capital of a future state.
	   Mubarak, Hussein and Arafat last met in September.
	   Egypt and Jordan are the only Arab countries that have signed
peace treaties with Israel.

Maruyama wins PGA Philanthropy title
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KITA-GUNMA, Japan (AP) _ Overnight leader Shigeki Maruyama shot
a 2-under-par 69 Sunday, just enough to hold off hard-charging
Satoshi Higashi and win the PGA Philanthropy, one of Japan's major
tournaments.
	   After two bogeys and two birdies on the front nine, Maruyama
regained his touch on the back side and sank two more birdies,
finishing at 20-under 264. Higashi fired a 7-under 64 and ended at
265.
	   Maruyama's victory, his first of the season and eighth overall,
was worth 18 million yen (dlrs 129,500) from a purse of 100 million
yen (dlrs 719,000).
	   ``I felt I wasn't so relaxed playing today,'' said Maruyama. ``I
had some sense of urgency to win, too.''
	   Last season, Maruyama won four tournaments and placed second on
the money earnings list.
	   Toru Suzuki, winner of the Sapporo Tokyu last month, shot a 68
and was alone in third place at 266.
	   Veteran Saburo Fujiki had a 67 for 269, followed by American
Brian Watts, who also shot a 67 for 270.

	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ The army has detonated 73
explosive abandoned by South African freedom fighters when they
returned home at the end of the apartheid era in 1994, a newspaper
reported Sunday.
	   Ignas Mbinga, the regional police commander, was quoted by
Majira, a Swahili language newspaper, as saying the explosives were
detonated this week, but gave no date.
	   The cache was located in the village of Mkongwe Msungura in the
Bagamoyo district, just 50 kilometers (35 miles) north of Dar es
Salaam.
	   The area had served as a base for the Pan-Africanist Congress
when the white minority government in South Africa pursued the
apartheid policy of legal racial discrimination
	   Residents of the area have been warned not to touch unusual
objects. One villager was killed last month while making charcoal
when a bomb exploded.

Estrada orders police to turn in big criminal in first 100 days
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ New President Joseph Estrada said
Sunday he has ordered police to turn in a ``big fish'' among the
country's criminals in 100 days to prove a crackdown on crime,
graft and drug trafficking is real.
	   Estrada has made crime-busting, along with improving the lives
of impoverished Filipinos, a cornerstone of his six-year
administration.
	   The former movie actor, who was sworn into office Tuesday,
planned to be his own secretary of interior and local government,
in charge of the national police, to personally supervise an
anti-crime and -graft drive.
	   Estrada urged Filipinos to help, promising improvements in the
country's justice system to ensure criminals would be prosecuted
and jailed, a statement issued by his office said.
	   As vice president and head of an anti-crime commission under his
predecessor, Fidel Ramos, Estrada was able to break up a number of
kidnap gangs and drug syndicates. The commission's powers were
eventually clipped, however, due to accusations that its agents had
illegally executed and tortured some suspects.
	   Despite police and military campaigns, ransom kidnappings and
other crimes persist in the Philippines due to widespread poverty,
collusion by police and military officials with crime gangs, and
refusal of victims and witnesses to cooperate.

Northern Ireland braces for Orange parade showdown

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with marchers leave for church, edits to conform,
trims. No pickup &QL;

	   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Amid tight security and with
no apparent hope of compromise, Protestant marchers set off Sunday
on an annual parade they insist will take them through Portadown's
main Catholic enclave.
	   Hundreds of members of the Orange Order, Northern Ireland's main
Protestant brotherhood, gathered in the center of Portadown before
setting off peacefully at 10.30 a.m. (0930 GMT) for a service at
the nearby Drumcree Anglican church. A showdown is expected when
they try to march back into Portadown along the mainly Catholic
Garvaghy Road, where residents oppose the march.
	   Ronnie Flanagan, chief constable of the Royal Ulster
Constabulary, said 2,000 police and soldiers have been deployed to
enforce a decision by a government-appointed Parades Commission
that the Orangemen should not march along the Garvaghy Road. For
the past two years, clashes over the march have sparked rioting
across the province.
	   With tension rising, Britain's chief official in Northern
Ireland appealed for calm. ``We don't want to see the violence we
have seen in previous years, because it benefits no one,'' Northern
Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam said in an interview on British
Broadcasting Corp. television Sunday morning.
	   ``No one wins, everyone will be a loser. We have come so far in
the last year that I just hope people will think twice and abide by
the law,'' she said.
	   All week, leaders from both sides have been saying they want to
avoid clashes, but compromise has eluded them. Talks early Sunday
between British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish
counterpart, Bertie Ahern, also failed to find a way out.
	   The dispute centers on who ``owns'' Portadown's Garvaghy Road _
the Catholics who live alongside it, or the Orangemen who view this
Protestant town as their spiritual home.
	   With a new power-sharing government now in place, Mowlam said,
Drumcree will provide ``the watershed test of the divided nature of
the community.'' No one wants Sunday's march to ``destroy what has
been built,'' she said.
	   At a somber news conference in Portadown on Saturday night,
local Orange Order chiefs again expressed outrage and the order not
to march down the Garvaghy Road, and accused Catholic residents of
refusing to compromise.
	   ``Every year we hit a brick wall. Every year we hit Breandan Mac
Cionnaith (Garvaghy residents' spokesman) who is completely
stubborn and who is holding his own people to ransom,'' said the
Rev. William Bingham. But local Orange leaders have refused to
negotiate with protesters from the Garvaghy Road.
	   Police and British soldiers have transformed Portadown into a
military camp, wrapping its Catholic enclave in an armored cocoon
and stringing barbed-wire barriers across pastures to thwart
Protestant marchers.
	   Flanagan has promised there will be no repeat of 1996, when
police tried to block the same disputed march but caved in after
five days of escalating Protestant mayhem across Northern Ireland.
	   Orange leaders say their Portadown members will camp out in the
church's graveyard and surrounding fields until they break the will
of the British authorities.
	   And Orangemen from outside Portadown were preparing to join
their blocked brethren Sunday afternoon or evening, after
conducting their own annual ``church parades'' at more than 30
other rural localities across Northern Ireland. They plan to run a
gauntlet of army and police checkpoints.
	   Orangemen have marched the Garvaghy Road route since 1807 as
part of their demonstration of Protestant solidarity. Portadown and
surrounding North Armagh form the heartland of the Orange Order,
founded in 1795 to defend the ``reformed faith'' against ``the
false doctrines of Popery,'' according to its oath.

U.S. official: Hong Kong making good start, but treason law a
</HEADLINE>
worry &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A U.S. official said Sunday that Hong Kong's
transition to Chinese rule had started well, but urged the
territory not to stifle freedom of expression with its new law on
treason and sedition.
	   Authorities say that since the handover, Hong Kong, for all of
its freedoms, may not be used as a base for subversion against the
Chinese mainland. Laws defining treason and sedition are expected
to be introduced into the new legislature, which began meeting
Thursday.
	   As yet, no one has said what approach the laws will take, but
political leaders pushing for more democracy say they will be an
important test of whether Hong Kong can retain its freedom of
expression.
	   The territory marked the first anniversary of the return of
Chinese sovereignty on July 1. Most observers agree that China has
largely kept its promise to let Hong Kong run its own affairs.
	   To the surprise of nearly everyone, the powerful economy has
turned out to be the main cause of concern. Along with much of
Asia, Hong Kong is slipping into recession.
	   U.S. Consul-General Richard Boucher, speaking on Hong Kong radio
Sunday, said the transition to Chinese rule had gone better than
expected, but that the United States would keep an eye on the
treason and sedition law.
	   ``It is our hope, and that of many others, that this law will do
nothing to inhibit the outspokenness and freedom of expression
which make Hong Kong such a hot pot of bubbling ideas and
information,'' Boucher said in a transcript released by the radio.
	   Economic problems would make the second year after the handover
difficult, Boucher said.
	   Boucher said Asia's problems were affecting the United States,
too. Echoing President Bill Clinton, who made Hong Kong the last
stop on his China tour, Boucher said the United States was doing
what it could to limit the crisis.

	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ President Pasteur Bizimungu of
Rwanda arrived Sunday for a three-day official visit which includes

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Members of the royal family have been sent
offensive packages through the post, police said Sunday. But they
refused to confirm news reports that the parcels contained rotting
flesh.
	   The News of the World tabloid reported Sunday that the packets
were addressed to Queen Elizabeth II and her eldest son, Prince
Charles.
	   It said a package addressed to the queen was intercepted at a
mail sorting office last month after blood was seen seeping out. It
was found to contain rotting offal, the newspaper said.
	   A spokeswoman said police ``are investigating a number of
packages which have been sent to several royal residencies in
London.''
	   ``These packages are offensive in nature but do not pose any
physical threat,'' said the spokeswoman, speaking with customary
anonymity.

Iraq's foreign policy dictated by Saddam, minister says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) - Iraq's foreign policy is entirely in the
hands of President Saddam Hussein and the Foreign Ministry only
implements his directives, the foreign minister said in remarks
published Sunday.
	   ``I cannot hide from you that the drawing up of foreign policy
is among the tasks of President Saddam Hussein, may God preserve
him,'' Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said in an interview with the
weekly al-Musawir.
	   ``The working program of the foreign ministry,'' is to execute
plans laid down by Saddam, al-Sahhaf added.
	   Saddam is chairman of the all-powerful Revolutionary Command
Council which is both a legislative and an executive body. He is
the country's prime minister and commander-in-chief of the armed
forces.
	   Last month, the Foreign Ministry revealed a list of 28 new
ambassadors to replace Iraqi diplomats abroad in a drive al-Sahhaf
said was designed to boost the latest diplomatic achievements by
Iraq. He did not elaborate.
	   Commenting on an unrelated subject, al-Sahhaf said U.N.
inspectors overseeing the destruction of Iraq's illegal weapons
were dominated by ``dirty hands from the United States.''
	   The United Nations imposed sweeping trade sanctions on Iraq for
invading Kuwait in 1990. The sanctions will not be lifted until
Baghdad proves to U.N. arms monitors that it has eliminated all its
weapons of mass destruction.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. mediator Richard Holbrooke was
trying to persuade both Serbs and ethnic Albanians to set aside
their deep differences over the future of Kosovo and concentrate on
something more immediate _ a cease-fire.
	   Holbrooke returned to Pristina, Kosovo's capital, on Sunday for
the second time in as many days to meet with Albanian factions
about suspending the fighting that has plagued the secessionist
province for months. In addition to Holbrooke, Russian Deputy
Foreign Minister Nikolai Afanasyevsky also met with the ethnic
Albanians' main political leader, Ibrahim Rugova.
	   ``That is why we came to Pristina today _ to say to Mr. Rugova
and his team that we support them as we support their peaceful
platform,'' Afanasyevsky told reporters Sunday during a break in
talks. ``We think that we must act swiftly and energetically.''
	   On Monday, a new diplomatic monitoring mission that includes
American, Russian, Austrian and Polish diplomats will begin a
series of inspections of battle zones in Kosovo.
	   ``It's a very important moment for Kosovo,'' Rugova said. ``We
are asking the armed groups on the ground and the local Albanian
population to form the best conditions for the mission.''
	   Ethnic Albanian separatists want independence for Kosovo, a
province in southern Serbia where Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1.
Serbia is the larger of the two republics remaining in Yugoslavia.
	   Hundreds of people have died in Kosovo since Serb forces stepped
up efforts to crush militant resistance in February. Milosevic says
the crackdown is aimed at ethnic Albanian militants who have
targeted Serb police.
	   Holbrooke spent Saturday night in the Yugoslavian capital,
Belgrade, where he met with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
on the same issue.
	   ``We are working with the Albanians to strengthen their
cohesiveness for the negotiations,'' Holbrooke said Sunday morning
in Belgrade before leaving for talks in Pristina. ``They are having
a little trouble getting their political act together.''
	   With lack of an agreement separating not only Serbs and
Albanians but also the Albanians themselves, chances of a long-term
peace look slight.
	   As Holbrooke shuttled between Belgrade and Pristina on Saturday,
a guerrilla spokesman dented U.S. hopes of getting Kosovo's
Albanian fighters and politicians to speak with one voice in their
struggle for independence.
	   The German news magazine Spiegel quoted a Kosovo Liberation Army
spokesman, Jakub Krasniqi, as saying the KLA would never take
orders from Rugova because his peaceful secession efforts had
failed.
	   Unlike the Americans, Afansyevsky indicated that Russia did not
believe in talking with the KLA, saying there were no grounds to
negotiate with armed radicals who ``kill citizens who are loyal to
Serbia.''
	   Clashes, meanwhile, were reported in southwestern Kosovo on
Saturday. Serb sources said police pushed back Albanian militants
who attacked Serb villagers at Movljane, a village 30 miles (48
kilometers) south of Pristina. An Albanian report said police and
armed Serb villagers attacked Gornja Krusica, a nearby Albanian
village, killing one person.

<TEXT>
	   JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ French Defense Minister Alain
Richard arrived here Sunday for talks on military cooperation,
diplomats said.
	   Richard arrived at this Red Sea port city and was greeted at the
airport by his Saudi counterpart Prince Sultan bin Abdul Aziz, said
the diplomats, speaking under customary condition of anonymity.
	   Richard is expected to discuss during his 24-hour visit the
possibility of selling the oil-rich kingdom battle tanks and other
military equipment worth dlrs 4 billion, said the diplomats.
	   Paris has been trying to sell Riyadh 355 Leclerc battle tanks
amid tough competition from the American MIA2 Abrams battle tank
and Britain's Challenger 2.
	   The Leclerc, built by Giat Industries, has already undergone
field tests in the Saudi desert.
	   France has sold Saudi Arabia more than dlrs 40 billion in arms
and military hardware since 1970.
	   Commercial exchanges between France and Saudi Arabia exceeded
dlrs 4 billion last year, and Paris is Riyadh's sixth major trade
partner.
	   French investments in Saudi Arabia represent less than 1 percent
of all foreign investment in the kingdom, but France still depends
on the Saudis for 25 percent of its petroleum.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Jordan's
King Hussein and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat met Sunday for
talks on stalled Mideast peace negotiations.
	   The three leaders are also expected to discuss Israeli plans to
expand the borders of Jerusalem and the recent confrontation
between Israeli and Palestinian troops in the Gaza Strip over
access to a road.
	   Israel's decision to extend municipal services to West Bank
Jewish settlements has angered Palestinians who accuse Israel of
violating the Israel-Palestinian peace accords by unilaterally
expanding Jerusalem's borders.
	   The plan, approved June 21 by the Israeli Cabinet, also calls
for the annexation of Jewish suburbs inside Israel to ensure
Jerusalem's Jewish majority of 70 percent.
	   The Arab leaders were also to discuss Israel's rejection of a
U.S. proposal that calls on Israel to withdraw from another 13 per
cent of the West Bank, which Israel captured from Jordan in 1967.
	   The Palestinians have already accepted the proposal, which aims
at restarting peace talks that have been stalled since March 1997,
when Israel began building a Jewish housing complex in mostly Arab
east Jerusalem. Palestinians want to make east Jerusalem the
capital of a future state.
	   Mubarak, Hussein and Arafat last met in September.
	   Egypt and Jordan are the only Arab countries that have signed
peace treaties with Israel.

<TEXT>
	   MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) _ Dutch left back Winston Bogarde
suffered possible fractured ankle in Sunday's training and was
taken to a local hospital via ambulance.
	   A news conference with Dutch coach Guus Hiddink was scheduled
for early Sunday afternoon, at which time Bogarde's exact injury
was expected to discussed.
	   Bogarde, who has appeared twice as a substitute during the World
Cup, was expected to start Tuesday's semifinal match against Brazil
due to the unavailability of regular left back Arthur Numan.
	   Numan received two yellow cards in Saturday's quarterfinal match
against Argentina and must serve an automatic one-game suspension.
	   The 27-year-old Bogarde tripped trying to maneuver around
Boudewijn Zenden in a morning scrimmage.
	   His injury causes major problems for the Dutch defense.
	   Marc Overmars, who entered the Argentina game as a second-half
substitute, is still doubtful due a hamstring injury suffered in
Thursday's training.
	   That would likely force Phillip Cocu to take over Overmars place
in left midfield.
	   The only other defender listed among the Netherlands' reserves
is Andre Ooijer, who is a natural right back and also is injured.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Thousands of people, many bringing children and
most carrying cameras, jammed downtown Kai Tak airport Sunday,
turning its final day of operation into an impromptu festival
celebrating a unique 73-year history.
	   The last flight, a London-bound Cathay Pacific jumbo jet, was to
leave shortly before midnight. Hong Kong's top civil servant, Chief
Secretary Anson Chan, was to turn out the lights at about 1 a.m.,
officially retiring Kai Tak.
	   New, dlrs 20 billion Chek Lap Kok airport, on an outlying island
30 kilometers (22 miles) to the west, opens Monday morning.
	   While there has been a broad consensus for years that something
needed to be done about crowded, noisy Kai Tak, Hong Kong was
having a hard time letting go. Some Hong Kong residents and
frequent visitors said they planned trips especially to use the
airport, with its roof-skimming approaches over crowded Kowloon and
takeoff over Kowloon Bay.
	   ``This is a mess,'' 19-year-old student Jenny Chung said of Kai
Tak. ``But it is a unique mess.''
	   Chung, who was flying to Vancouver Sunday, and her family were
among the many people posing for pictures at an airport sign
outside the terminal.
	   People crowded the airport all day, and their numbers grew
toward its final few hours of operation. Spectators were lined
three or four deep around the airport's perimeter.
	   A spokeswoman, Mandy Tsoi, said workers had started moving
equipment at 8:30 a.m. (0030 GMT) Sunday, and that dozens of road
shipments had been made. Three barges also had been shipped off to
Chek Lap Kok.
	   About 30 planes were to make a 15-minute flight from the old
airport to the new one.
	   By early evening, police said they had blocked roads to normal
traffic to permit trucks carrying equipment to move unimpeded to
Chek Lap Kok. Deck loaders, used for loading cargo into planes,
were being prepared for the trip.
	   Thunderstorms and possibly heavy rain were forecast but not
expected to affect the schedule.
	   On Sunday, TV footage showed workers buffing the marble floors
of the new airport, said to still be too shiny, and putting final
touches on retail stores.
	   Construction of the massive airport _ about the size of London's
Heathrow airport _ involved flattening two islets and pushing back
the sea to accommodate two runways. The airport project includes a
1,363-meter (4,475-foot)-long suspension bridge, an express highway
and a railway to link the remote airport to downtown.
	   Inside Kai Tak's crowded, old terminal, parents were looking
around with their children, and nearly everyone, it appeared, had a
camera. Police had closed off the top two floors of a parking
garage that is a favorite spot for taking pictures of planes coming
in low over Hong Kong. However, photographers jammed the lower
floors, and every landing was accompanied by the click of shutters
and exclamations.
	   Samuel Law, a 33-year-old photographer, and Lily Leung, a
secretary, said they were flying to Seoul, South Korea, Sunday to
use Kai Tak one more time. They planned to return in five days,
using the new airport.
	   ``It's like sending off an old friend,'' Law said.
	   Jacqueline Har, a flight attendant for Hong Kong-based Cathay
Pacific, said the new airport was bigger and clearly has better
facilities, but that she will miss Kai Tak.
	   ``I'm so thrilled every time I land here, even though I've been
doing it for four years,'' she said.
	   The new airport has been marred by controversy. First announced
in 1989 to boost people's confidence amid political uncertainty and
an economic downturn, the massive project was denounced by the
Chinese, who accused the British of draining Hong Kong's coffers
before they turned the territory over to China on July 1, 1997.
	   Disputes over funding, and a delay in the completion of the
airport railway, delayed the opening by about a year.
	   On Thursday, Chinese President Jiang Zemin dedicated Chek Lap
Kok airport before becoming the first passenger to leave from it.
Hours later, U.S. President Bill Clinton became the first one to
land there.

Northern Ireland braces for Orange parade showdown

	   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Protestant marchers set off
Sunday on an annual parade they insist will take them through this
town's Catholic enclave _ despite thousands of police and soldiers
deployed to block them.
	   Hundreds of members of the Orange Order, Northern Ireland's main
Protestant brotherhood, gathered in the center of Portadown before
setting off peacefully at 10.30 a.m. (0930 GMT) for a service at
the nearby Drumcree Anglican church. A showdown is expected when
they try to march back into Portadown along the mainly Catholic
Garvaghy Road, where residents oppose the march.
	   Ronnie Flanagan, chief constable of the Royal Ulster
Constabulary, said 2,000 police and soldiers have been deployed to
enforce a decision by a government-appointed Parades Commission
that the Orangemen should not march along the Garvaghy Road. For
the past two years, clashes over the march have sparked rioting
across the province.
	   With tension rising, Britain's chief official in Northern
Ireland appealed for calm. ``We don't want to see the violence we
have seen in previous years, because it benefits no one,'' Northern
Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam said in an interview on British
Broadcasting Corp. television Sunday morning.
	   ``No one wins, everyone will be a loser. We have come so far in
the last year that I just hope people will think twice and abide by
the law,'' she said.
	   Apart from the beat of a drum, the parade was silent as it
passed the top of the Garvaghy Road on its way to church. Garvaghy
residents' leader Breandan MacCionnaith urged about 200 residents
back from the steel and barbed wire barricades blocking the road
with the words, ``We want no incidents here.''
	   About two dozen police officers stood between the marchers and
the protesters.

Maiden voyage ends in embarrassment

<TEXT>
	   CORFU, Greece (AP) _ A luxury passenger ferry hit a reef and was
towed back to port early Sunday on its maiden voyage from Greece to
Italy.
	   The Ancona-bound ferry boat Pasiphae, operated by Minoan Lines,
was sailing through the narrow straits separating the Ionian island
of Corfu from the Albanian coast when it ran aground on a reef,
coast guard officials said.
	   Three tugboats towed the leaking ship back to shore and all 500
passengers disembarked safely.
	   The bottom of the Pasiphae has a 60-meter (200-foot) gash, and
the coast guard has forbidden the ship to sail. Another Minoan
Lines ferry picked up the passengers stranded on Corfu.

Orangutans dying off from land clearing and wildfires
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Their jungle habitats overrun by
plantation owners and stripped by recent fires, orangutans on
Borneo Island are rapidly dying off, wildlife specialists say.
	   The population of the red-haired apes, which exist in the wild
only on Borneo, has dropped to between 20,000 and 30,000, Birute
Galdikas, president of Orangutan Foundation International, was
quoted as saying in Sunday's Star newspaper.
	   Galdikas said an estimated 180,000 orangutans lived a decade ago
on Borneo, which is shared by Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei.
	   Massive deforestation by oil palm plantations in Indonesia's
Kalimantan state and recent wildfires that raged through Borneo
were the main causes for the declining numbers of the apes,
Galdikas told a meeting of environmentalists in Sarawak, a
Malaysian state on Borneo.
	   The fires have stripped the apes' natural habitats of food. Many
were forced to flee the jungle, often into the villages of illegal
hunters, who earn between dlrs 4,000 and dlrs 8,000 per animal on
the black market, Galdikas said.
	   Sarawak Chief Minister Abdul Taib Mahud said the state planned
to set up its third orangutan sanctuary in Ulu Sebuyau. The others
are in Lanjak Entimau and Batang Ai National Park.
	   Nature lovers have become increasingly concerned about the
illegal hunting of endangered animals since a tiger ate two
villagers in Ipoh state two weeks ago. The tiger was killed by
conservators.
	   An autopsy of the animal showed that it had been severely
wounded by hunters and left unable to hunt in the wild.
	   Environmentalists have urged a crackdown on illegal hunting and
on deforestation, which has animals' food sources and given hunters
easier access to the jungle.
	   Ramli Ngah Talib, Ipoh's chief minister, echoed the demand over
the weekend, saying it would be in the best interest of the animals
and humans to limit hunting licenses or stop issuing them
altogether.
	   The Malaysian tiger has been classified by the World Wildlife
Fund as an endangered species. Only 500 are believed still living
in the wild.

<TEXT>
	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ The army has detonated 73
explosives abandoned by South African freedom fighters when they
returned home at the end of the apartheid era in 1994, a newspaper
reported Sunday.
	   Ignas Mbinga, the regional police commander, was quoted by
Majira, a Swahili language newspaper, as saying the explosives were
detonated this week, but gave no date.
	   The cache was located in the village of Mkongwe Msungura in the
Bagamoyo district, just 50 kilometers (35 miles) north of Dar es
Salaam.
	   The area had served as a base for the Pan-Africanist Congress
when the white minority government in South Africa pursued the
apartheid policy of legal racial discrimination
	   Residents of the area have been warned not to touch unusual
objects. One villager was killed last month while making charcoal
when a bomb exploded.

Pope gives lecture on importance of Sundays
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ A tired-looking Pope John Paul II on Sunday
sternly reminded Catholics to obey the Third Commandment and go to
church on the Lord's day.
	   For many, Sundays have come to be ``felt and lived only as a
weekend,'' John Paul said during his weekly address from his window
over St. Peter's Square.
	   ``Sunday is something much different: It is the weekly day in
which the church celebrates the resurrection of Christ,'' he said.
``In obedience to the Third Commandment, Sunday must be sanctified,
above all by participation in holy Mass.''
	   The pontiff acknowledged that these days, going to Mass often
means ``going against the grain.''
	   Three days before leaving for his mountain vacation, John Paul
sounded a bit fatigued. The Vatican said he skipped a recitation of
the rosary Saturday night on Vatican Radio to avoid non-essential
public appearances.
	   John Paul noted that on Tuesday, the Vatican would make public
an apostolic letter on the sanctity of Sundays, and suggested it
might make good reading for summer vacation.
	   ``Why not take this little volume with you and dedicate a few
hours of calm reading?'' he said.
	   Then the pontiff said he would be leaving for the mountains on
his own holiday Wednesday, and wished everyone a happy vacation.

Decision to buy U.S. Guns not final, Kuwaiti minister says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The government has not made a final decision on
buying U.S.-made howitzers for the Kuwaiti army, but the guns are
its top choice, the defense minister said in remarks published
Sunday.
	   Sheik Salem al-Sabah's comments were made in response to
criticisms by a member of parliament who criticized plans to buy 48
Paladin howitzers. The guns, according to the Pentagon, would cost
the small oil-rich state about dlrs 496 million.
	   Several members of the 50-seat house criticized the government
last month for seeking to buy the weapons despite expert opinion
that they were unsuitable for the country's armed forces.
	   ``We would like to stress that a final decision about choosing
the American gun has not been made yet,'' Sheik Salem wrote in a
letter to legislator Mubarak al-Duwailah. It was published Sunday
in Al-Siyassah daily.
	   ``However, it is considered one of the top choices,'' the
minister added.
	   Sheik Salem said Kuwait has requested a number of changes in the
self-propelled gun and its support equipment so that they would
become more suitable for use in Kuwait's harsh desert climate.
	   Americans have promised to respond to these requests in a
meeting that is to take place in Kuwait, Sheik Salem said. He did
not give a date.
	   He said the Kuwaiti army will find the modified gun easier to
train on because it has used its earlier models.
	   Al-Duwailah, a Muslim fundamentalist, has accused the government
of wasting public money on the deal to please the United States,
Kuwait's main Gulf War ally.
	   Kuwait signed a 10-year defense agreement with Washington
shortly after the war that liberated Kuwait from a seven-month
Iraqi occupation in February 1991. The pact calls for weapons
purchases and joint war games.
	   A parliamentary committee for the protection of public money is
investigating the Howitzer deal.

New Philippine president plans to hold office on a yacht
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada plans to
hold office on a yacht while traveling around the country to
fulfill a campaign promise to reach out to Filipinos, an official
said Sunday.
	   A yacht used by past Philippine presidents mostly for leisure is
being refurbished to turn it into Estrada's offshore office, Press
Secretary Rodolfo Reyes said.
	   The popular ex-movie star, who was inaugurated as the country's
13th president Tuesday, has pledged to hold office about three
months at a time in the central Visayas and southern Mindanao
regions each year.
	   Reyes said the yacht would dock at several major ports in
provinces Estrada would visit.
	   His predecessor, Fidel Ramos, frequently traveled abroad, but
Estrada has promised to stay home during most of his six-year
presidency to try to reduce widespread poverty in the Philippines.

U.N. predicts sharp drop in Somalia's cereals harvest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Somalia's corn and sorghum harvest this
year is expected to hit a five-year low and aid organizations
foresee food shortages in the coming months, the U.N. World Food
Program said Sunday.
	   Ricardo Cueva, WPF deputy director in Somalia, was quoted in an
agency statement as saying the 1998 harvest is expected to be
160,000 to 170,000 tons, or as low as 34.6 percent of last year's
harvest of 462,000 tons.
	   Cueva said the harvest will be the poorest since 1993.
	   The agency attributed the drop to heavy rains that flooded much
of the grain producing southern Somalia late last year and poor
rains early this year.
	   ``One of the many setbacks was that when the flood waters
receded, some families who had lost virtually all their good stocks
planted small areas of off-season crops,'' Cueva said.
	   He said that as a result, when the abnormally low rains early
this year came late, these families had no room to plant seasonal
corn and sorghum.
	   Cueva said the floods also broke river embankments, destroyed
irrigation canals, heavily silted the soil and led to extensive
growth of weed infested with rats, crickets and other vermin.
	   Fighting among militias in southern Somalia has limited chances
for farmers to work in the fields, Cueva said.
	   Somalia has had no central government since the 1991 ouster of
the late dictator Mohamed Siad Barre and the country's
disintegration into fiefdoms protected by clan militias.
	   ``There's no doubt that thousands of families will need our help
in the months ahead,'' Cueva said.
	   He said WFP plans to distribute 5,000 tons of emergency food in
the next three months.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Protestant marchers set off
Sunday on an annual parade they insist will take them through this
town's Catholic enclave _ despite thousands of police and soldiers
deployed to block them. Hundreds of members of the Orange Order,
Northern Ireland's main Protestant brotherhood, gathered in the
center of Portadown before setting off peacefully at 10.30 a.m.
(0930 GMT) for a service at the nearby Drumcree Anglican church. A
showdown is expected when they try to march back into Portadown
along the mainly Catholic Garvaghy Road, where residents oppose the
march. (Northern Ireland)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. mediator Richard Holbrooke was
trying to persuade both Serbs and ethnic Albanians to set aside
their deep differences over the future of Kosovo and concentrate on
something more immediate _ a cease-fire. Holbrooke returned to
Pristina, Kosovo's capital, on Sunday for the second time in as
many days to meet with Albanian factions about suspending the
fighting that has plagued the secessionist province for months. On
Monday, a new diplomatic monitoring mission that includes American,
Russian, Austrian and Polish diplomats will begin a series of
inspections of battle zones in Kosovo. (Yugoslavia-Kosovo)
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Jordan's
King Hussein and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat met Sunday for
talks on stalled Mideast peace negotiations. The three leaders are
also expected to discuss Israeli plans to expand the borders of
Jerusalem and the recent confrontation between Israeli and
Palestinian troops in the Gaza Strip over access to a road.
Israel's decision to extend municipal services to West Bank Jewish
settlements has angered Palestinians who accuse Israel of violating
the Israel-Palestinian peace accords by unilaterally expanding
Jerusalem's borders. (Egypt-Summit)
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ The Swiss favor diplomatic moves to
head off U.S. threats of sanctions against Swiss banks but would
back a protest to the World Trade Organization over any American
boycott, according to a survey published Sunday. In the poll of 605
people, carried out by the Isopublic research institute, 61.2
percent said Switzerland should file a complaint with the WTO over
planned U.S. sanctions. Some 23 percent opposed such a move. New
York City and state on Thursday turned up the pressure over
deadlocked talks between Swiss commercial banks, Jewish groups and
lawyers for Holocaust survivors by announcing plans to withhold
business from the banks and, if no solution is found, from other
Swiss firms. Other states also have announced plans for sanctions.
(Swiss Banks-Nazis)
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Rockets pounded the northeastern
outskirts of the Afghan capital Sunday, injuring three people _
including two children, eyewitnesses said. Shrapnel from one of the
five rockets wounded a father and his child, who were sleeping in
the yard when the rocket hit. Another child was hurt from shrapnel
elsewhere in the area, nearby residents said. A mosque also was
destroyed in the barrage. The rockets were believed to have been
fired by opposition soldiers trying to hit the Kabul airport, which
handles both military and civilian aircraft. (Afghanistan-Rockets)

Government official caught taking dlrs 10,000 bribe from American
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A senior government official was
arrested for accepting thousands of dollars as a bribe from an
American businessman, media reported Sunday.
	   Petre Isac, a consultant for the Romanian government, demanded
an American businessman, Vasile Bouleanu, pay him dlrs 10,000 to
get permission to build two water purification plants, Mediafax
news agency said.
	   Bouleanu, a Romanian-born American, informed a presidential
aide, who helped organize a sting. Police caught Isac late Friday
with the money on him, which had been marked with a fluorescent
substance. Prosecutors' issued an arrest warrant Saturday.
	   Foreigners trying to do business in Romania often complain that
even the most mundane of tasks, such as registering a car or
consulting a doctor, require a bribe.
	   The sting comes after criticism that corruption was flourishing
at the highest levels. Security officers employed by the
president's office were fired recently, for having connections in a
huge cigarette smuggling operation.
	   Corruption in Romania has flourished since the 1989 fall of
communism. The new government, elected 18 months ago, has vowed to
root out corruption as part of its reforms.

U.S. liaison seeks to mollify Taiwan over Clinton remarks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Washington's top liaison with Taiwan
assured nervous officials Sunday that President Bill Clinton's
China visit had not altered U.S. commitments to this island.
	   Richard Bush told reporters that Clinton's just concluded visit
did not indicate Washington was bolstering Beijing's position on
reunifying Taiwan with the mainland.
	   ``United States policy toward Taiwan has not changed. In all its
elements, it is exactly the same as before Clinton's trip,'' Bush
said.
	   Foreign Minister Jason Hu said he told Bush that Taiwan suffered
``psychological fallout'' from Clinton's statement in Shanghai last
week articulating what is called the ``three no's'' policy: no
support for an independent Taiwan, no recognition for a separate
Taiwanese government, and no backing Taiwan's entry into
international organizations.
	   Washington now needs to take concrete measures to reassure
Taiwan, such as raising the profile of contacts between Washington
and Taipei, Hu said.
	   ``You can't do everything with (China) in the glare of the
spotlight, and keep contacts with us totally low key,'' Hu said.
``Our people will misunderstand.''
	   Though U.S. officials have made identical statements in the
past, Clinton's public reiteration of the three no's was the first
by a U.S. president.
	   Many here saw that as a concession to Clinton's Chinese hosts,
and say it will further shrink Taiwan's already highly limited
maneuvering room in international society.
	   Clinton has defended his statement as a simple reiteration of
existing policy. Other officials have accused Taiwan of
overreacting to the statement.
	   Though potentially damaging, Clinton's statement was foreseen by
the Foreign Ministry, which immediately issued a statement
chastising the United States for discussing Taiwan's interests with
another party.
	   Hu didn't greet Bush at the ministry's front door as on previous
visits, and was five minutes late for their meeting, held in a
reception room directly next to the minister's office. Originally
scheduled to talk for half an hour, the two men did not emerge for
an hour and a half.
	   Bush will meet with President Lee Teng-hui and other officials
on Monday. He is expected to fly to Guam Thursday to meet with
Taiwanese Premier Vincent Siew, stopping over in the American
territory on his way back from a visit to three South Pacific
island nations.
	   Though they have been united for just four years in the last
century, China continues to claim Taiwan as a breakaway province.
The two split most recently in 1949 when Chiang Kai-shek's
Nationalists fled here after losing the Chinese civil war to
Communist forces.
	   Taiwan's U.N. seat was handed over to China in 1971, and the
government began seeking to return to the world body several years
ago.
	   The United States shifted recognition from Taipei to Beijing in
1979, but maintains close unofficial relations with Taiwan, and is
its main arms provider. Bush is the U.S.-based chairman of the
American Institute in Taiwan, which handles relations in the
absence of diplomatic ties.
	   Washington officially says the sides should resolve their
dispute peacefully without outside intervention.
	   But there has been speculation here that Clinton's comment will
strengthen China's drive to force Taiwan to accept the same model
for reunification applied to Hong Kong when British colonial rule
ended there last year.
	   ``No American president before used this sort of language, or
presumed to decide Taiwan's fate for it. (Clinton's comments) pose
a considerable challenge to Taiwan's freedom and democracy,''
opposition lawmaker Parris Chang told a scholarly forum Sunday.
	   Clinton's statement ``denies Taiwan's sovereignty,'' said
scholar Huang Huang-hsiung. ``This might be the greatest foreign
policy frustration (Taiwan President) Lee Teng-hui has encountered
in his decade in power,'' he said.
	   The governing Nationalists officially advocate eventual
reunification with China, but not on Beijing's terms. In surveys,
most Taiwanese favor maintaining the status quo of de-facto
independence.

Graham backs into tie for seniors lead with 7-under 65
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVID GINSBURG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLUMBIA, Maryland (AP) _ David Graham put himself in the
driver's seat after shooting a 7-under-par 65 Saturday in the State
Farm Senior Classic.
	   Graham, still recovering from a back injury caused by a cart
mishap, used a bogey-free round to move into a first-place tie with
Tom Jenkins after two rounds of the 54-hole tournament. Jenkins,
the first-round leader, shot a 69 for a 134 total.
	   Terry Dill had a 68 for a 135. Graham Marsh, who began the day a
stroke behind Jenkins, shot a 70 and finished tied with Fred Gibson
and Dave Stockton at 136.
	   Graham jammed a disk in April after shooting a sparkling 69 in
the first round of The Tradition. The accident occurred when an
attendant driving him to the press tent in a cart hit a large speed
bump while driving a bit too fast.
	   The jarring blow forced Graham to withdraw from the tournament
and left him virtually inactive for nearly a month. He said
Saturday that he's still only at 95 percent.
	   After his solid round Saturday, Graham didn't take any chances _
he drove himself to the press tent.
	   ``Hopefully this is the start of me playing well again,'' said
Graham, vying for his second title of the year. ``I'm really only
just starting to get back to form now. It takes a while.''
	   Graham used a run of three straight birdies to go 6-under after
four holes, then followed a par at No. 5 with a 10-foot (3 meter)
birdie putt. He moved to 9-under with birdies at Nos. 11-12 and
broke a run of four straight pars with a 3-foot (1 meter) birdie
putt on 17.
	   Graham spent two weeks before the tournament on a break that
included plenty of relaxation and more than a little time working
on his short game and putting. Much to his delight, those two
aspects of his play were important pluses Saturday.
	   ``It's nice to see the fruits of your labor,'' he said.
	   Jenkins opened the round with a birdie, then birdied both par-3s
on the front nine to make the turn at 10-under. His 6-iron off the
tee on the 185-yard (170 meter) eighth hole ticked the edge of the
hole and stopped 3 feet (1 meter) from the pin.
	   ``That was probably the best shot of the day for me,'' he said.
	   Jenkins hit a 6-foot (2 meter) putt for a birdie on 14, but he
got his first bogey of the tournament at the par-3, 192-yard (175
meter) 16th when he hit a 5-iron into the bunker and two-putted.
	   Jenkins, a senior rookie, is looking for his first victory after
finishing in the top 10 in each of his last three events.
	   ``I've gotten used to this and I know what to expect,'' he said.
``There's still a lot of great players on the board, so it's going
to take a good number tomorrow to win.''
	   Dill remained in the hunt with a steady round in which he was
forced to save par only once, overcoming a bad drive on No. 12 with
a sand wedge from the bunker and a 12-foot (4 meter) putt.
	   Stockton had five birdies and two bogeys for a 69, and Gibson's
67 featured four birdies on the back nine. Marsh had two birdies
and 16 pars.
	   Bruce Summerhays and Bob Duval shot 68s to finish the round at
137, three strokes behind the co-leaders. Hale Irwin, Leonard
Thompson and Walter Hall were at 138.
	   Arnold Palmer fell out of the chase with a 73 for a 144 total.
He had four bogeys and two birdies, ending a run of three straight
sub-par rounds over two weeks.

Death toll in northwestern Kenya attack rise to 84
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The death toll in a clash last week
between Kenya's Pokot and Uganda's Karamojong tribesmen has risen
to 84, a newspaper reported Sunday.
	   The casualties in the northwestern Kenya's Thursday clash
included 36 Karamojongs killed by Pokots who were pursuing stolen
cattle, the Sunday Nation said.
	   It reported two Kenyan survivors as saying most of their
comrades died when the Karamojongs ambushed the Pokots and opened
fire with a bazooka.
	   Both groups were armed with rifles and some on the Kenyan side
actually belong to the Kenya Police Reserve and are armed by the
government to defend the community from Karamojong attacks.
	   The two groups have traditionally raided each other for cattle,
but in recent years death tolls have been high because the raiders
use firearms instead of spears.
	   Firearms are readily available in the area because of civil
strife in neighboring Uganda, Sudan and Ethiopia.
	   The Nation said Kenya government plans to deploy two army units
in the area to prevent future Karamojong infiltrations.
	   In the past, Kenya and Uganda armies have cooperated to stymie
fighting between the Karamojong and the Pokot, but at the moment
Ugandans are fighting a more serious insurgence in the country's
north and have no troops to spare on tribal clashes.

Detention extended for Jewish settler accused of attack on Arabs

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A Jerusalem court extended the detention Sunday
of a 19-year-old Jew suspected of vandalizing several Arab-owned
cars near the West Bank city of Hebron.
	   The Magistrates Court extended the detention of Nathaniel Nir by
five days. Two other young men suspected of involvement in the
Friday night vandalism spree have yet to be caught, Israeli police
spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said.
	   The three Israelis, riding horses and disguised as Arabs, are
suspected of shattering the windshields and denting cars parked
near the Jewish settlement Kiryat Arba, on the outskirts of the
mainly Palestinian city of Hebron.
	   In a separate incident, at least four Palestinian fruit stalls
were burned down early Sunday morning in Hebron. One stall owner,
Adbel Samad Abu Sneineh, said he saw four Jewish settlers running
from the scene.
	   ``This is a brutal action and I demand protection for myself and
others from these settlers,'' Abu Sneineh said.
	   Menuhin said police were investigating the incident.
	   Palestinian Justice Minister Freih Abu Medein told the
Palestinian newspaper Al-Hayat that the recent attacks on
Palestinians were part of a settler plot to ``exterminate our
people.''
	   About 500 Jewish settlers live in downtown Hebron, in the midst
of 130,000 Palestinians. Relations between the two communities are
tense and from time to time there are outbreaks of violence.
	   Most of the city is controlled by the Palestinian Authority, but
the Israeli army and police control the Jewish enclaves and Arab
neighborhoods close to them.

Raging fires under control as authorities investigate cause
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photos ATH101-104 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Fire fighters on Sunday afternoon had
controlled most of the raging blazes that killed one and destroyed
dozens of homes and thousands of acres of fores.
	   Government officials said they would investigate arson as a
cause for the rash of 180 wildfires that broke out all over Greece
on Saturday.
	   After an emergency meeting Sunday, two cabinet members said it
was suspicious that 120 blazes broke out within a single hour.
	   Fire fighters were still fighting ten out-of-control blazes
Sunday afternoon, while several dozen other fires were subsiding.
	   Hot, dry winds and high temperatures spurred the weekend
outbreak that quickly spread over the countryside.
	   Officials were still trying to evaluate the scope of the damage.
	   One woman died in Salamina in central Greece while trying to
escape her burning home.
	   At least eight people were taken to hospitals suffering from
smoke inhalation. Preliminary estimates tallied 40 houses damaged
or destroyed and several thousand acres of forest and woodland
reduced to ash.
	   More than 1,000 soldiers joined about 2,000 fire fighters in the
effort to rein in the blazes. Premier Costas Simitis ordered a
nation-wide alert for all military personnel.
	   Political fallout continued Sunday as municipalities and
opposition leaders accused the government of poor coordination in
fighting the blazes.
	   Fire fighters couldn't reach all the fires, and in several
places residents tried to put out flames with branches, rocks and
blankets.
	   Gusting winds had grounded fire-fighting planes and fanned
flames on Saturday. But the winds subsided Sunday, allowing fire
fighters to limit the blazes.

Dutch left back suffers possible fractured shin
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with news conference, Hiddink saying suspected
fracture is of fibula. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) _ Dutch left back Winston Bogarde
suffered possible fractured shin in Sunday's training and was taken
to a local hospital via ambulance.
	   ``I don't know exactly what it is, but I think it is a fracture
in his fibula,'' Dutch coach Guus Hiddink said. ``It is serious. He
is now in the hospital in Monaco and we have to see if he will
undergo surgery in Amsterdam or if a surgeon will be flown here.''
	   The 27-year-old Bogarde tripped trying to maneuver around
Boudewijn Zenden in a morning scrimmage. The fibula is the smaller
of the two bones that run from the knee to the ankle. His injury
causes major problems for the Dutch defense heading into Tuesday's
World Cup semifinal match against Brazil.
	   ``It is a terrible disappointment for him personally and for the
team after the euphoria of yesterday,'' Hiddink said.
	   Bogarde, who has appeared twice as a substitute during the World
Cup, was expected to start Tuesday's semifinal match against Brazil
due to the unavailability of regular left back Arthur Numan.
	   Numan received two yellow cards in Saturday's 2-1 quarterfinal
victory over Argentina and must serve an automatic one-game
suspension.
	   Without Numan and Bogarde, Hiddink will have to scramble to form
a back line.
	   Marc Overmars, who entered the Argentina game as a second-half
substitute, is still doubtful due a hamstring injury suffered in
Thursday's training.
	   That would likely force Phillip Cocu to take over Overmars place
in left midfield.
	   The only other defender listed among the Netherlands' reserves
is Andre Ooijer, who is a natural right back and also is injured.

Calves cloned from adult cells in Japan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo TOK106 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Two calves born Sunday are the first clones from
cells from an adult cow, Japanese scientists said Sunday.
	   The so far unnamed twins were born exactly two years after
Dolly, the British sheep that made history by becoming the first
clone of an adult animal.
	   The two calves are the second adult-animal clones, and were
produced by a similar technique, said Toyokazu Morita, an official
of the Ishikawa Prefectural Livestock Research Center.
	   ``We have succeeded in producing calves from adult-animal
clones, meaning that we can produce calves exactly similar to adult
cows,'' said Morita.
	   He said the new technique would be used to breed better cattle
strains with higher-quality beef or greater milk capacity.
	   On Feb. 16, scientists in the United States produced a clone
calf _ a Holstein named Gene _ but Gene's genes originated in a
cell from a 30-day-old fetus rather than an adult cell.
	   Morita said calves had previously been cloned through the
cultivation of ova with fertilized egg cells or cells from a cow
fetus.
	   Jointly with a Kinki University animal husbandry research group,
the center took somatic cells from an adult cow and placed them in
unfertilized eggs whose own nuclei had been removed.
	   Then two artificially cultivated embryos each were placed into
the wombs of five cows last November, Morita said.
	   All five cows became pregnant and one of them gave birth to the
twins Sunday, although all were expected on Aug. 13, Morita said.
	   The center is 295 kilometers (184 miles) northwest of Tokyo.

Light touches for summer in menswear shows
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo PAR101 &QL; 
 &UR; By SUZY PATTERSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Fashion Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) - While male mobs are glued to the World Cup matches,
designers are still getting attention for next summer's menswear at
shows all over town.
	   There is not too much zany stuff, since houses showing here are
aiming to please - whatever the slot, from office to beach.
	   Trends to watch include light linen and fabric mixes in straight
or wider pants, a variety of jackets, from impeccably-tailored to
unstructured, sober shades, but with emphasis on white, cream,
beige, khaki, light blue or petrol, ochre and a few pastels.
	   Pierre Cardin showed for the first time in years.
	   His assistants came up with a slick, modernistic angle much as
Cardin made a name for in the 60s and 70s, including geometric
capped sleeves for fellows, vinyl motorcycle looks, too.
	   Bare-chested jock styles with nylon pants and embossed belts
looked like urban cowboys, whereas a red scoop-necked jumpsuit with
fancy belt might be fun for a beach rave, along with the
bright-satiny beach-boy shorts.
	   Showing at the Paris Stock Exchange, Yohji Yamamoto featured his
favorite murky shades, casual looks, some great figured or printed
jackets in green and pinky hues, with green taffeta trousers.
	   These were unisex or epicene fashions for men or women, with
lean trousers, sandals, plus some suits for men featuring floppy
pants, knife-like embroidery on jackets.
	   A raft of white cotton or linen shirts to wear like jackets were
of very high quality.
	   At Hermes, Veronique Nichanian celebrated ten years as menswear
designer here with wonderfully casual beach-style wear: new
bias-cut shirt-jackets in linen, straight hemp linen trousers worn
with desert-style jackets or blousons in ``toilaverse'' - a new
silky-looking fabric.
	   The show in a beautiful blond-pinewood decor of the Japanese
Cultural Centre near the Eiffel Tower, was ``Just because we love
the decor,'' said Hermes' boss, Jean-Louis Dumas. He says that in
spite of the crisis in Asia, ``our Japanese sales are still going
strong.''
	   Rei Kawakubo's offering for Comme des Garcons in a majestic
outdoor setting of the Palais Galliera fashion museum was based on
what she called ``hidden treasures'' - for special guys; these took
the form of multi-ruffled shirts, peeping out of well-tailored
shirts, cropped pants, showing bright socks and shoes with effects
like spats or those little flat, strapped coolie slippers.
	   At Lanvin, things were more sporty, less quirky - as Dominique
Morlotti showed clothes both formal and casual in beautiful
fabrics, masculine cuts. The bottle-green lightly-shaped suits with
long or straightforward regular-length jackets, straight pants in
cool wool, crepe and suede looked good in various pastels, taupe,
gray or petrol blue, ochre or cream.
	   The brighter, summery drawstring windbreakers looked winners in
brighter colors, and the light linen beachwear with its hints of
Indian tunics could be a natural for Deauville or Biarritz.
	   Thierry Mugler's suits were well-tailored and relaxed in deep
gray or blue, one or two-buttoned by distinctive matte pewter
buttons, or snapped, the Mugler trademark. Neat trousers came out
in shiny or linen fabrics.
	   Great denim jeans suits and battle jacket outfits with
cargo-pocket pants also had a contemporary flip, as those side
pockets on the pants are all the rage.
	   The Christian Dior collection in the spanking new shop at Saint
Germain-des-Pres was a quiet moment of true chic in Paris's new
Left-Bank center of fashion.
	   ``We're aiming for end-of-this-century classicism, modern and
relaxed, yet elegant,'' said Patrick Lavoix, the natty designer
turned out in a creamy linen-silk blend jacket with waistcoat and
gray trousers.
	   The elegant small shop for men and women will in this new
fashion mecca features menswear in a beautifully-paneled
ground-floor space for its impeccable heavy-silk ties, shirts to be
worn alone with the vests in summer, minus jackets, or great
shirt-jackets. Suits in new alpaca-silk-cashmere blends are superb
for the smart dresser.

World Cup: Brazil sees hand of fate in Netherlands matchup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OZOIR-LA-FERREIERE, France (AP) _ With the Dutch once again in
Brazil's path to the World Cup title, coach Mario Zagallo sees more
than history. He senses destiny.
	   ``We cannot fight it,'' he said. ``Destiny is inscribed. Our
destiny is the Netherlands.''
	   Many Brazilians were gearing up to face South American rival
Argentina when fate and Dennis Bergkamp stepped in. The Dutch
striker's last-minute goal on Saturday snapped a 1-1 tie with
Argentina and moved the Netherlands into the Cup semifinals.
	   It will be the third time Brazil _ and Zagallo _ have faced the
Dutch in a World Cup. The 66-year-old coach has special reason to
remember the first _ it was the only Cup he's lost in five tries as
player, coach or team coordinator.
	   The year was 1974, and defending champion Brazil drew the
``Clockwork Orange'' in the semifinals. Johan Cruyff and company
dispatched Brazil 2-0, and Zagallo, in his first stint as coach,
was accused of underestimating one of the greatest teams of all
time.
	   Twenty years later, the two met again in a quarterfinal game
that many considered the best of the '94 Cup. Losing 2-0, the Dutch
battled back to tie it 2-2 before Branco got the winner on a
curling free kick just inside the post.
	   Zagallo, who was the technical coordinator in 1994, has a lot of
respect for the Dutch, and even picked the Netherlands as a
candidate to win it all.
	   ``They have a refined ball touch and great individual talent,''
he said. ``It's impressive that they can lose a player like (Marc)
Overmars and not feel the difference.''
	   But beyond their rivalry, the Brazilians have a special
admiration for Dutch soccer artistry. They speak reverently of the
great Dutch teams of the '70s and lament the slow death of ``art
soccer.''
	   Rinus Michels, the Dutch coach in 1974, recently was quoted as
saying the two teams that showed the world something new in soccer
were his Clockwork Orange and Brazil's 1970 World Cup champions
with Pele, Jairzinho, Rivelino and Tostao.
	   ``I agree completely,'' Zagallo said. ``In 1970, we played
beautiful football. In 1974, it was exactly the same with the
Dutch.''
	   Both teams had virtuoso players in constant movement, a virtue
that Zagallo tries to teach Ronaldo.
	   ``They were players with a high IQ,'' he said. ``They had to be
intelligent to understand what the coach wanted. To perform those
movements, any mistake would be fatal.''
	   For Zagallo, the ``carousel'' conceived by Michels in 1974 was a
high point of art soccer
	   ``It was totally different from anything we've seen before or
since,'' he said. ``Even the Dutch could never repeat it.''
	   Despite flashes of brilliance by today's stars, that kind of
soccer is gone for good, he says.
	   ``Today, football is totally different,'' Zagallo said. ``With
the physical development and the speed imposed, the spaces are
minimal. Thinking has to be a lot faster.''
	   ``Today, the idea is not to let the other team play,'' he added
wistfully. ``Back then, we played football.''

Northern Ireland braces for Orange parade showdown
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in police stop marchers going through Catholic
enclave; pickup graf 9 pvs &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Police and soldiers on Sunday
prevented Protestant marchers taking their annual parade through
Portadown's Catholic enclave, a step the authorities hope will
prevent clashes that could once again ignite this troubled
province.
	   After a service at nearby Drumcree Anglican church, some 1,500
members of the Orange Order, Northern Ireland's main Protestant
brotherhood, marched up to police barricades erected at the top of
Portadown's mainly Catholic Garvaghy Road, the Orangmen's chosen
route back into town.
	   Local Orange Order leaders made a symbolic complaint to police
barring their path before turning around and heading back toward
Drumcree, where thousands of other Orangemen were gathering from
across the province.
	   The protest was peaceful and there were no incidents. But the
Orangemen have vowed to stand firm until they are allowed through.
	   ``This is a total disgrace, stopping British subjects from
walking the queen's highway,'' said Harold Gracey, district master
of Portadown Orangemen. ``I can assure Her Majesty's Government
that we will be staying here until such time as we are allowed our
legitimate right to walk the road.''
	   Police chief Ronnie Flanagan has said that unlike previous
years, police will not force the march down the Garvaghy Road,
where residents oppose the march. Instead, they will enforce the
ruling of a government-appointed Parades Commission that Orangemen
be kept off the Garvaghy Road, he said.
	   Two thousand police and soldiers have been deployed in
Portadown, a predominantly Protestant town which on Sunday was
decked out in bunting in the red, white and blue of the British
flag Sunday. In the past two years, clashes over the march have
sparked rioting across Northern Ireland.
	   With tension rising, Britain's chief official in Northern
Ireland appealed for calm. ``We don't want to see the violence we
have seen in previous years, because it benefits no one,'' Northern
Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam said in an interview on British
Broadcasting Corp. television Sunday morning.
	   ``No one wins, everyone will be a loser. We have come so far in
the last year that I just hope people will think twice and abide by
the law,'' she said.
	   All week, leaders from both sides have been saying they want to
avoid clashes, but compromise has eluded them. Talks early Sunday
between British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish
counterpart, Bertie Ahern, also failed to find a way out.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A Jerusalem court extended the detention Sunday
of a 19-year-old Jew suspected of vandalizing several Arab-owned
cars near the West Bank city of Hebron.
	   The Magistrates Court extended the detention of Nathaniel Nir by
five days. Two other young men suspected of involvement in the
Friday night vandalism spree have yet to be caught, Israeli police
spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said.
	   The three Israelis, riding horses and disguised as Arabs, are
suspected of shattering the windshields and denting cars parked
near the Jewish settlement Kiryat Arba, on the outskirts of the
mainly Palestinian city of Hebron.
	   In a separate incident, at least four Palestinian fruit stalls
were burned down early Sunday morning in Hebron. One stall owner,
Adbel Samad Abu Sneineh, said he saw four Jewish settlers running
from the scene.
	   ``This is a brutal action and I demand protection for myself and
others from these settlers,'' Abu Sneineh said.
	   Menuhin said police were investigating the incident.
	   Palestinian Justice Minister Freih Abu Medein told the
Palestinian newspaper Al-Hayat that the recent attacks on
Palestinians were part of a settler plot to ``exterminate our
people.''
	   About 500 Jewish settlers live in downtown Hebron, in the midst
of 130,000 Palestinians. Relations between the two communities are
tense and from time to time there are outbreaks of violence.
	   Most of the city is controlled by the Palestinian Authority, but
the Israeli army and police control the Jewish enclaves and Arab
neighborhoods close to them.

Raging fires under control as authorities investigate cause
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greek fire fighters controlled Sunday most
of the raging blazes that had killed one person and destroyed
dozens of homes and thousands of acres (hectares) of forest.
	   Government officials said they would investigate whether the 180
wildfires that broke out across Greece on Saturday were
deliberately set.
	   After an emergency meeting Sunday, two cabinet members said it
was suspicious that 120 blazes broke out within an hour.
	   Fire fighters were still fighting ten out-of-control blazes
Sunday afternoon, while several dozen other fires were subsiding.
	   Hot, dry winds and high temperatures spurred the outbreak.
	   Officials were still trying to evaluate the scope of the damage.
	   One woman died in Salamina in central Greece while trying to
escape her burning home.
	   At least eight people were taken to hospitals suffering from
smoke inhalation. Preliminary estimates showed 40 houses damaged or
destroyed and several thousand acres (hectares) of forest and
woodland reduced to ash.
	   More than 1,000 soldiers joined about 2,000 fire fighters in the
effort to rein in the blazes.
	   Political fallout continued Sunday as municipalities and
opposition leaders accused the government of poor coordination in
fighting the blazes.
	   Fire fighters couldn't reach all the fires, and in several
places, residents tried to put out flames with branches, rocks and
blankets.
	   Gusting winds had grounded fire-fighting planes and fanned
flames on Saturday. But the winds subsided Sunday.

England face defeat at Old Trafford
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ England faces another embarrassing
defeat to South Africa after being forced to follow-on in the third
cricket test at Old Trafford on Sunday.
	   England's tail-end batsmen offered little resistence in the
first session of the forth day, adding 21 runs to the overnight
total before losing the final two wickets.
	   Resuming the day on 162 for eight, the England first innings
lasted just 26 minutes, as Paul Adams and Kallis combined to remove
Darren Gough and No.11 Angus Fraser.
	   Gough top edged left arm spinner Adams to mid wicket and five
balls later Kallis trapped Fraser leg before wicket for a first
ball duck (0).
	   Adams finished with 4-63 in 31 overs while Allan Donald, Lance
Klusener and Kallis claimed two wickets each.
	   South Africa sent the homeside back in, still facing a 369-run
deficit, then took two early wickets to have England in serious
trouble at 31 for two at lunch.
	   England captains past and present _ Mike Atherton and Alec
Stewart _ were together at the break, carrying slim hopes of saving
the test.
	   Atherton and Stewart, together for 35 minutes, have managed 15
and 10 runs respectively as they battle to delay the inevitable.
	   England is still 338 runs away from avoiding an innings defeat
and will have to survive another five sessions to stop South Africa
from taking an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the five-match series.
	   After Donald had opener Nick Knight (one) caught behind for the
second time in the match, Kallis beat Nasser Hussain (five) with an
unplayable outswinger to knock out the right hander's off stump.
	   Batting became increasingly difficult under helpful condition
for swing bowling in an overcast morning.
	   Earlier, veteran opener Gary Kirsten hit a career-best 210 and
Kallis scored 132 as South Africa declared its first innings on 552
for five after 13 tedious hours of batting.

Tehran mayor accuses authorities of torture
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The mayor of Tehran, on trial for corruption
and embezzlement, sparred with the judge Sunday saying the trial
was a sham.
	   Gholamhossein Karbaschi, whose sensational trial has gripped the
nation since it opened a month ago, once again rejected all charges
against him and reiterated that authorities had tortured senior
municipality officials to extract false confessions against him.
	   He said the investigation into charges against him was being
carried out by thugs.
	   ``You've set up a group of 70 men, most of whom have little more
than a high-school education, and put them in charge of this
investigation. They take each person into a basement and emerge
with a confession. What is the meaning of this?'' Karbaschi asked
the court.
	   When judge Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejaei insisted that Karbaschi
either admit or deny that he had ordered the payment of 8.3 billion
rials (dlrs 2.7 million) to a private company without documenting
or registering the transaction,'' the mayor exploded.
	   ``What kind of trial is this? Either read me my written order or
bring me the person whom I instructed to do this,'' Karbaschi
shouted.
	   ``All of my files have been seized by the court, and I have
nothing available to me to defend myself,'' he said.
	   Karbaschi's trial is widely seen as an attempt by hard-liners in
the ruling clergy to topple key officials allied with moderate
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami. Karbaschi ran Khatami's
election campaign last year.
	   Karbaschi read out Sunday a letter by Kamal Azimi Nia, one of
his top deputies, who had confessed to several charges of
corruption and embezzlement at the municipality, and to providing
illegal funds for Khatami's campaign.
	   ``When they brought me into court, I had been beaten so badly in
prison with whips and clubs that I could hardly walk,'' Karbaschi
read from the letter.
	   ``They forced me to write and sign lies about myself and other
prisoners or persons,'' the letter said.
	   The judge adjourned the case until Thursday. If convicted,
Karbaschi faces up to 10 years in jail, a fine and a ban from
holding public office.
	   Karbaschi was arrested on April 4 on charges of embezzlement,
fraud and mismanagement of public funds. He was released on bail 11
days later.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Members of the royal family have been sent
offensive packages through the post, police said Sunday. But they
refused to confirm news reports that the parcels contained rotting
flesh.
	   The News of the World tabloid reported Sunday that the packets
were addressed to Queen Elizabeth II and her eldest son, Prince
Charles.
	   It said a package addressed to the queen was intercepted at a
mail sorting office last month after blood was seen seeping out. It
was found to contain rotting offal, the newspaper said.
	   A spokeswoman said police ``are investigating a number of
packages which have been sent to several royal residencies in
London.''
	   ``These packages are offensive in nature but do not pose any
physical threat,'' said the spokeswoman, speaking with customary
anonymity.

Turkey opens Ottoman archives for Palestinian land claims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey will allow Palestinian legal
experts to search Ottoman archives for documents concerning
disputed land ownership in Jerusalem, a newspaper said Sunday.
	   Faisal Husseini, the Palestinian official for Jerusalem affairs,
said archive officials had welcomed his request to search for
evidence that land had been unlawfully sold to Israelis, the
English-language Turkish Daily News reported.
	   The Ottoman Empire controlled the area -- then called Palestine
-- until World War I, when it was lost to the Allied forces.
	   Official confirmation of the report was not immediately
available.
	   According to the paper, Husseini's initiative stems from the
recent Israeli move to expand the municipal borders of Jerusalem.
	   The plan to extend municipal services to the Jewish West Bank
settlements that ring Jerusalem was approved in June by the Israeli
Cabinet. It also calls for the annexation of Jewish suburbs inside
Israel to ensure Jerusalem's Jewish majority of 70 percent.
	   Husseini was on a two-day visit to Turkey.
	   Turkey's Foreign Minister Ismail Cem is due for a four-day visit
to Israel Monday, where he is set to hold talks with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Arafat, Mubarak, King Hussein meet on stalled peace process
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout with leaders warning violence will erupt if
deadlock persists, ADDS byline. No pickup.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The deadlock in Middle East peace talks and
an Israeli plan to extend Jerusalem's borders could ignite violence
that may prove uncontrollable, Egypt's president warned Sunday.
	   Mubarak met King Hussein of Jordan and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat in a hastily called and brief summit amid warnings that
tension over the deadlock has reached dangerous levels.
	   ``The present situation is very difficult,'' Mubarak said at a
news conference, flanked by Arafat and Hussein. ``We're afraid that
if the situation continues in this manner, violence will erupt.''
	   ``The Israeli government must understand that if the danger
begins, the situation will be difficult to control,'' he said.
	   Israel's decision to extend Jerusalem's municipal services to
West Bank Jewish settlements has angered Palestinians, who accuse
Israel of violating the Israeli-Palestinian peace accords by
unilaterally making decision on Jerusalem's future.
	   The plan, approved June 21 by the Israeli Cabinet, also calls
for the annexation of Jewish suburbs inside Israel to ensure the
Jewish majority of 70 percent in Jerusalem, where Palestinians hope
to set up the capital of a future state.
	   The United States has proposed that Israel withdraw from another
13 percent of the West Bank as a way to revive talks that have been
stalled since March 1997 when Israel began building a Jewish
housing unit in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
	   The Palestinians have accepted the proposal. Israel has not.
	   The tension almost erupted into violence last week when Israeli
and Palestinian troops confronted each other with assault rifles
and armored personnel carriers in what began as an argument over
control of a road in the Gaza Strip.
	   A compromise reached with the help of U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis
Ross ended the confrontation before anyone was hurt.
	   Mubarak, Hussein and Arafat last met in September.
	   Egypt and Jordan are the only Arab countries that have signed
peace treaties with Israel.

Malaysia to act against 20 corporations for software piracy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's government will take
action against 20 corporations for using pirated software, a
newspaper said Sunday.
	   The 20 still could be given a chance to make their software
legal, the New Sunday Times said. Violations can be punished by
fines of up to 10,000 ringgit (dlrs 2,500) or five years in prison
for each illegal copy of software seized.
	   The Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry had started a
30-day awareness campaign on illegal software April 9, and then
told the 20 corporations to legalize their software, the paper
said.
	   It said the 20 include banks, finance and securities companies,
and engineering, insurance and architect firms.
	   Mohd Roslan Mahayudin, head of the ministry's enforcement
division's investigation and prosecution unit, said the most common
infringement by these corporations was unauthorized copying of
software.
	   ``We will not hesitate to act against anyone who disregards the
intellectual property rights laws of this country,'' he said.

General's killing politically motivated colleague says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A colleague of slain parliament deputy Lev Rokhlin
said Sunday he believed the lawmaker was killed for political
reasons and was not killed by his wife after a quarrel.
	   Rokhlin, a retired general and leading parliamentary opponent of
President Boris Yeltsin was found dead at his country residence
Friday and his wife confessed to killing him, police officials
said.
	   Alexander Morozov, Rokhlin's deputy in the Movement in Support
of the Armed Forces, told the Interfax that he believed the
lawmaker's killing was politically motivated.
	   ``The Movement leadership is convinced there are no reasons to
suspect Rokhlin's wife of committing the murder,'' Morozov said.
	   Rokhlin's wife Tamara, 48, told police on Friday that that she
had a ``hostile relationship'' with her husband and that she used
his personal handgun to shoot him as he lay sleeping.
	   Rokhlin's daughter, Yelena, said in a television interview
Saturday night she did not believe her father had been killed by
her mother. She said her mother confessed because ``someone'' had
threatened to kill her family.
	   However, Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin told Interfax Sunday
that police were satisfied that Rokhlin had been killed by his wife
following an argument.
	   Interfax, citing law enforcement sources, said Mrs. Rokhlin has
not yet been officially charged with murder, but is being held for
three days on suspicion of committing a crime under section 122 of
the criminal code.
	   Rokhlin, 51, commanded Russian troops at the beginning of the
1994-96 war in Chechnya. He was one of the few Russian military
figures to win high praise for his performance in the conflict,
which resulted in an embarrassing defeat for the Russian forces.
	   After leaving the military, he won election to parliament in
1995 as a member of a faction that supported Yeltsin.
	   Rokhlin later grew disenchanted with Yeltsin's plans for
military reform, and he broke with the president, becoming a fierce
critic. Last year, he launched the Movement in Support of the Army,
an anti-government organization that sought to unseat Yeltsin.

Tehran mayor accuses authorities of torture
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The mayor of Tehran, on trial for corruption
and embezzlement, sparred with his judge Sunday and called his
trial a sham.
	   Mayor Gholamhossein Karbaschi, whose sensational trial has
gripped Iran since it opened a month ago, rejected all the charges
against him and reiterated his accusation that authorities had
tortured senior municipality officials to extract false confessions
against him.
	   He said the investigation into the charges was carried out by
thugs.
	   ``You've set up a group of 70 men, most of whom have little more
than a high-school education and put them in charge of this
investigation. They take each person into a basement and emerge
with a confession. What is the meaning of this?'' Karbaschi asked
the court.
	   When judge Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejaei insisted that Karbaschi
either admit or deny that he had ordered the payment of 8.3 billion
rials (dlrs 2.7 million) to a private company without documenting
or registering the transaction,'' the mayor exploded.
	   ``What kind of trial is this? Either read me my written order or
bring me the person whom I instructed to do this,'' Karbaschi
shouted.
	   ``All of my files have been seized by the court, and I have
nothing available to me to defend myself,'' he said.
	   Karbaschi's trial is widely seen as an attempt by hard-liners in
the ruling clergy to topple key officials allied with moderate
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami. Karbaschi ran Khatami's
election campaign last year.
	   Karbaschi read Sunday a letter by Kamal Azimi Nia, one of his
top deputies, who had confessed to corruption and embezzlement at
the municipality and to providing illegal funds for Khatami's
campaign.
	   ``When they brought me into court, I had been beaten so badly in
prison with whips and clubs that I could hardly walk,'' Karbaschi
read from the letter.
	   ``They forced me to write and sign lies about myself and other
prisoners or persons,'' the letter said.
	   The judge adjourned the case until Thursday. If convicted,
Karbaschi faces up to 10 years in jail, a fine and a ban from
holding public office.

No revenge on Germany but Croatia looms large
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CLAIREFONTAINE, France (AP) _ The French fans were hoping for
Germany, and revenge at last. Instead, they'll they'll get Croatia
in the semifinals, and Les Bleus are fully aware that the World Cup
newcomers hardly play like rookies.
	   ``It's only a half surprise for me,'' French coach Aime Jacquet
said after Croatia's stunning 3-0 quarterfinal upset of the Germans
on Saturday. ``Beating Germany 3-0 needs no further comment.''
	   For the past week, the French media had been preparing the third
chapter of France's struggle against Germany in the World Cup
semifinals _ one to add to the 4-3 loss in 1982 and a 2-0 defeat in
1986.
	   ``The big revenge won't happen,'' wrote the French sports daily
L'Equipe Sunday under the headline ``Croatia, That's No Present.''
	   And instead of dreams of a grandiose match against three-time
champions, memories are drifting back to the European Championship
semifinals of two years ago, when France also faced a new central
European nation it was supposed to dominate _ the Czech Republic.
	   Instead, it lost in a penalty shootout, Jacquet's only setback
in his four-career as coach of France.
	   ``We have to watch out,'' Jacquet said Sunday. ``It's a new
nation, a new flag and Croatia is very dangerous.''
	   Croatia broke away from Yugoslavia in 1991 and is playing in its
first World Cup _ a fact made even more remarkable when one
considers it is the first time it even tried to qualify.
	   Instead of a unmovable German bloc the players had been
expecting, it will be the individual brilliance of players like
Davor Suker and Robert Jarni that France now has to prepare for.
	   Almost all are veterans of Europe's richest leagues and have
played with a rare sense of pride for the red-and-while checkered
flag of the Balkan nation of 4.7 million.
	   ``They are very strong individuals. They may not have the
mentality of Germany, but one player can make the difference,''
French left back Bixente Lizarazu said.
	   But Lizarazu is part of the most stifling World Cup defense so
far, one which includes that not-so-easily intimidated likes of
Marcel Desailly and Laurent Blanc. In five games, the defense has
allowed just a single goal _ and that on a penalty.
	   ``In my mind, we cannot stop in the semifinals,'' Jacquet said.
	   And after three weeks of injury problems, France is living for
Wednesday's semifinal at the 80,000 Stade de France with little
physical worries.
	   Star playmaker Zinedine Zidane has survived a two-game
suspension and against Italy proved his value to the team.
	   The only worry is that Les Bleus have lost their scoring touch.
After nine goals in the three first-round games, the offensive
outpour was reduced to a trickle.
	   Only defender Laurent Blanc has scored, tallying the World Cup's
first ``Golden Goal''. Against Italy on Friday, both sides went
goalless until the penalty shootout.
	   ``If we keep creating chances, we'll score goals,'' Jacquet
said.

Tribal clashes leave one dead in Bangladesh
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Weekend clashes between tribespeople
and Muslim settlers in Bangladesh left one woman dead and 20 people
injured, an official said Sunday.
	   The injuries, five of them serious, came in a violent
confrontation Saturday between tribal youths and Muslim shop owners
near Rangamati town, 210 kilometers (130 miles) southeast of the
capital Dhaka, a district official said by telephone.
	   The official said the clashes occurred when a group of
tribespeople attacked a Muslim shopowner who refused to pay
extortion money.
	   Muslim settlers retaliated and chased the extortionists out of
the marketplace, but hours later the attackers returned to loot,
the official added.
	   A Buddhist monk was hurt while trying to stop a group of angry
Muslims from entering a temple in search of tribal attackers.
Muslim settler Nasima Begum, 55, died in the violence.
	   Last month a group of tribal youths had allegedly stopped a bus,
dragged out a Muslim trader and slaughtered him apparently for
refusing to pay extortion money.

Newspaper says cleanup needed before Commonwealth Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ With only 68 days before the
Commonwealth Games, host city Kuala Lumpur still is not up to the
mark in cleanliness, a newspaper said in an editorial Sunday.
	   The New Sunday Times urged authorities to immediately form
citizen groups to make the environment presentable for the games'
thousands of visitors.
	   ``Sad to say, evidence of unsightly clutter and indiscriminate
littering is still overwhelming,'' said the paper, which normally
reflects government policy.
	   It said that although authorities have started to place more
garbage bins in strategic public places, there are still areas
without them.
	   ``Inefficient refuse collection is another contributory
factor,'' it said.

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greek fire fighters Sunday controlled most
of the raging blazes that had killed one person and destroyed
dozens of homes and thousands of acres (hectares) of forest.
	   Government officials said they would investigate whether the 180
wildfires that ravaged Greece on Saturday were deliberately set.
	   After an emergency meeting Sunday, two cabinet members said it
was suspicious that 120 blazes broke out within a single hour.
	   Fire fighters were still fighting ten out-of-control blazes
Sunday afternoon, while several dozen other fires were subsiding.
	   Hot, dry winds and high temperatures spurred the outbreak.
	   Officials were still trying to evaluate the scope of the damage.
	   One woman died in Salamina in central Greece while trying to
escape her burning home.
	   At least eight people were taken to hospitals suffering from
smoke inhalation. Preliminary estimates showed 40 houses damaged or
destroyed and several thousand acres (hectares) of brush and forest
reduced to ash.
	   More than 1,000 soldiers with military equipment assisted about
5,000 fire fighters across the country.
	   Political fallout continued Sunday as municipalities and
opposition leaders accused the government of poor coordination in
fighting the blazes.
	   Fire fighters couldn't reach all the fires, and in several
places, residents tried to put out flames with branches, rocks and
blankets.
	   Gusting winds had grounded fire-fighting planes and fanned
flames on Saturday. But the winds subsided Sunday.

Nearing 30, Novotna hits her peak at Wimbledon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEVEN WINE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Jana Novotna's first Wimbledon title
might not be her last.
	   She turns 30 in October _ elderly by tennis standards _ but
she's still going strong, as Martina Hingis, Venus Williams and
Nathalie Tauziat can attest.
	   Novotna beat them all at Wimbledon. With a 6-4, 7-6 (7-2)
victory Saturday over Tauziat, Novotna earned the first Grand Slam
title in her 13-year career.
	   ``I'm quitting now,'' she joked. ``It's over.''
	   In truth, Novotna plans to continue playing. And with her
reputation as a choker finally eradicated, she may become a more
formidable force than ever.
	   ``If she doesn't win another match, it doesn't matter,'' said
her coach, Hana Mandlikova. ``But of course she'll keep playing and
fighting. I think she'll play for another two or three years. This
is a huge thing for her and will give her even more motivation.''
	   The future may belong to Hingis, Williams and the rest of
tennis' teen-age vanguard, but Novotna and Tauziat, 30, proved that
there's still room at the top for a veteran.
	   ``I'm pleased about that,'' Tauziat said. ``It's important to
show them we're here. They have to realize everybody can play well,
whether you are young or older. Age has nothing to do with tennis
right now, especially on grass.''
	   Grass is Novotna's best surface, which is why she could continue
to be a threat at Wimbledon. Her athleticism and serve-and-volley
game have always been perfectly suited to the surface, and only a
fragile psyche held her back.
	   She sobbed on the shoulder of the Duchess of Kent after blowing
a big lead in the 1993 Wimbledon final. She led again in the 1997
final before losing to Hingis.
	   On Saturday, Novotna overcame a slow start to win the first set,
and she was the player with more poise in the second-set
tiebreaker. She dedicated the victory to Mandlikova, a four-time
Grand Slam champion and Novotna's coach since 1990.
	   ``I was the one who always believed that she could do it if she
put the hard work in,'' Mandlikova said. ``I've always tried to
instill security in her. I tried to instill positive thinking. It
took four years to get it into her, talking every day to her,
telling her to give 100 percent to the sport.''
	   Novotna caught a break when she drew the No. 16 seed in the
final, but her path to the championship was hardly easy. She
eliminated Williams in the quarterfinals and the top-ranked Hingis
in the semifinals.
	   ``To win a championship when you beat the No. 1 player in the
world, it makes it really special,'' Novotna said.
	   The Czech will climb from third to second behind Hingis in this
week's rankings, matching a career high.
	   ``No. 1 is not out of Jana's reach,'' said Pam Shriver, a BBC
commentator and former U.S. Open finalist. ``I really think she
should set that as her goal.''
	   One of the oldest players in the women's draw, Novotna earned
dlrs 620,000 for first place, which would make a nice retirement
bonus. But she hardly sounded like someone on the verge of calling
it quits.
	   ``Tennis is something that I love to do,'' she said. ``It's good
to be good at it.''

Raging fires under control as authorities investigate cause
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES number of firefighter to 5,000 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greek firefighters controlled Sunday most
of the raging blazes that had killed one person and destroyed
dozens of homes and thousands of acres (hectares) of forest.
	   Government officials said they would investigate whether the 180
wildfires that broke out across Greece on Saturday were
deliberately set.
	   After an emergency meeting Sunday, two cabinet members said it
was suspicious that 120 blazes broke out within an hour.
	   Firefighters were still fighting ten out-of-control blazes
Sunday afternoon, while several dozen other fires were subsiding.
	   Hot, dry winds and high temperatures spurred the outbreak.
	   Officials were still trying to evaluate the scope of the damage.
	   One woman died in Salamina in central Greece while trying to
escape her burning home.
	   At least eight people were taken to hospitals suffering from
smoke inhalation. Preliminary estimates showed 40 houses damaged or
destroyed and several thousand acres (hectares) of forest and
woodland reduced to ash.
	   More than 1,000 soldiers joined about 5,000 firefighters in the
effort to rein in the blazes.
	   Political fallout continued Sunday as municipalities and
opposition leaders accused the government of poor coordination in
fighting the blazes.
	   Firefighters couldn't reach all the fires, and in several
places, residents tried to put out flames with branches, rocks and
blankets.
	   Gusting winds had grounded fire-fighting planes and fanned
flames on Saturday. But the winds subsided Sunday.

Expelled Argentine to miss three Copa America games; Cafu, Numan

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Ariel Ortega, expelled from a World Cup
quarterfinal for headbutting Dutch goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar,
will miss the first three games of the 1999 Copa America.
	   The talented midfielder, who impressed with his play while
wearing the No. 10 shirt made famous by the volatile Diego
Maradona, was shown the red card for an off-the-ball incident in
the 87th minute of Argentina's quarterfinal Saturday against the
Dutch in Marseille.
	   Ortega was convinced he had been tripped inside the area and
protested for a penalty, but Mexican referee Arturo Brizio
disagreed and signalled for play to continue. Van der Sar,
convinced Ortega had taken a dive, ran from his goal to confront
him and stood over the grounded Argentine forward.
	   As Ortega rose to his feet, he struck the keeper on the chin
with his head and Van der Sar fell to the ground. Brizio ran over
and showed Ortega the red card for violent conduct.
	   Dutch striker Dennis Bergkamp scored the winner for his team in
the final minute to eliminate Argentina 2-1.
	   The next major competition for Argentina will be the Copa
America, meaning Ortega will miss the entire first round of next
year's tournament.
	   Brazil's Cafu and Dutch defender Arthur Numan will miss
Tuesday's semifinal confrontation at Marseille because of automatic
suspensions.
	   Cafu received his second yellow card of the championship during
Brazil's quarterfinal against Denmark for time-wasting. His first
was against Chile in the second round a week earlier.
	   Numan was expelled against Argentina for his second yellow card
of the game.
	   Whichever team gets through the semifinal, it will get back the
services of their suspended player, who will be available for the
final.
	   Christian Woerns, expelled just before halftime in the 3-0 loss
to Croatia, will miss Germany's first two qualifying games for the
2000 European Championship.

Sampras goes for 5th Wimbledon title; Ivanisevic after first
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: will be topped after each set

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Top-seeded Pete Sampras was favored to
win his fifth Wimbledon singles titles Sunday _ matching the five
won by Bjorn Borg _ when he faced 14th-seeded Goran Ivanisevic, who
was seeking his first Wimbledon title in three tries.
	   Sampras and Ivanisevic, both 26, met in the 1994 final with
Sampras winning in three sets, including 6-0 in the third.
Ivanisevic also lost in the '92 final to Andre Agassi.
	   A win would give Sampras 11 Grand Slam titles, tying him with
Borg and Rod Laver for second place on the all-time list. Roy
Emerson holds the men's record with 12 titles.
	   Ivanisevic, going for his first Grand Slam singles title, has
seen his ranking slump to 25th after being a top-five player.
	   London bookmakers listed Sampras as a 1-3 favorite, in part
because he's 4-0 in Wimbledon finals and 26-1 on Centre Court, with
the only loss in the 1996 quarterfinals to eventual champion
Richard Krajicek.
	   Sampras is also 10-2 in Grand Slam finals.
	   The left-handed Ivanisevic, a Croatian who celebrated his
country's 3-0 semifinal World Cup upset over Germany on Friday, has
_ like Sampras _ one of the game's biggest serves.
	   The 6-foot-4 (1.94-meter) Croatian trails the series with
Sampras 10-6 and had won only one of the last eight matches.
They've played twice at Wimbledon _ Sampras won in straight sets in
the '94 final and won in five sets in the 1995 semifinals.
	   Though Sampras entered as the favorite, he had failed to reach
the semifinals in the past three majors. This year Sampras' results
have been so far below par that if he loses Sunday, he'll drop to
No. 2 in the rankings behind Marcelo Rios of Chile.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt's national carrier, EgyptAir, on
Sunday resumed its flights to the Eritrean capital Asmara after it
received assurances from Eritrea and Ethiopia that it would be safe
to fly there.
	   The flights were suspended after the two African nations fought
briefly in border dispute last month.
	   Some 98 passengers were flown on EgyptAir to Asmara on Sunday
and 58 were were flown to Cairo, said Mahmoud al-Rawi, EgyptAir's
director-general.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Foreign trading at the Amman Stock Exchange
nudged up by 85.2 percent to 60.2 million dinars (dlrs 84.8
million) between January and May this year.
	   A market report released on Sunday attributed the increase to an
investment promotion law enacted last year that provide
non-Jordanians with tax and customs exemptions and equal ownership
rights to Jordanians.
	   About 55 percent of foreign trading this year _ with Gulf Arab
states as well as Asian, American and European countries _ focused
on shares of lucrative commercial banks, the report said.
	   It said the 60-company share price index slipped in June by 2.87
percent, or 5.16 points, from the previous month. Turnover in the
same period also dropped by 27.7 percent to 23.2 million dinars
(dlrs 32.6 million).
	   Brokers said the drop was caused by sluggish activity as
Jordanian investors stayed away from the floor because of
uncertainty over a settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
 &UR; ___
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Bahrain-based Gulf Air said Sunday it has
added Kathmandu, Nepal, to its list of destinations.
	   The twice-weekly flights from Bahrain and Abu Dhabi began on
Saturday, the company said in a press release.
	   Flights are operated by the airline's fleet of Airbus A340
aircraft, it said.
	   Gulf Air, which is owned by four Gulf states _ Bahrain, Qatar,
Oman and Abu Dhabi _ flies to 50 destinations in Europe, the Middle
East, Africa and Asia.
 &UR; ___
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The government has rejected a parliament-approved
law aimed at encouraging Kuwaitis to work for the private sector,
saying it was too costly to implement, Al-Siyassah daily reported
Sunday.
	   The law, passed last month by the 50-seat legislature,
stipulates the government pays social allowances of Kuwaitis who
work for private companies as if they were working for the
government. It also provides for unemployment payments for
nationals who cannot find jobs.
	   Attracted by good salaries and benefits _ and shorter working
hours _ most Kuwaitis work as civil servants, leaving the more
demanding private sector jobs for foreigners.
	   In a decree published by the newspaper, the government asked the
house to reconsider the law that ``could not be implemented with
the available financial resources.''
	   The economy of this oil-rich state has been hit by sluggish oil
prices and the costs of the 1991 Gulf War that liberated it from a
devastating seven-month Iraqi occupation. It faces an estimated
deficit of 1.73 billion dinars (dlrs 5.65 billion) in the fiscal
year that started this month.
	   The decree did not provide any figures, but the planning
minister, Ali al-Moussa, has reportedly told parliament that the
law would cost around 1 billion dinars (dlrs 3.26 billion) in 10
years.
	   If the legislature insists on the law, it will have to pass it
again with a two-third majority.
 &UR; ___
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's rice production is expected to exceed
1.7 million tons by next year, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported Sunday.
	   Rice production will reach 1.75 million tons, 50,000 tons more
than the target set for the country's second five-year economic
development plan, which ends in 1999, the agency reported.
	   Iran will import 500,000 tons of rice this year, compared with
750,000 tons imported last year, it said. Rice is the main staple
in Iran.

World Cup: Report says Owen will stay at Liverpool
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England's 18-year-old soccer star Michael Owen
says he will stay at Liverpool despite lucrative offers from rich
clubs European clubs wanting to sign him.
	   Owen, who scored one of the best goals of the World Cup during
England's loss to Argentina, told the News of the World he wanted
to stay at Merseyside team for ``a few years yet''.
	   The instant stardom and predictions he will become one of
soccer's richest players have not gone to his head _ he still lives
at home with parents.
	   He said scoring the goal against Argentina was a dream come
true.
	   ``The elation was unbelievable. I saw my mum and dad sitting by
the halfway line and ran towards them jumping with joy,'' he said.
	   ``I wouldn't swap what I've got now for anything. Dreams really
can come true.''
	   Despite the plaudits, Owen said England captain Alan Shearer
still deserved the title as the best striker in the country.
	   ``He is what I'm striving to be,'' he said.

Jail inmates escape during World Cup match
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Eight jail inmates sawed their way to
freedom during the Croatia-Germany World Cup soccer match, but Thai
police refused to say the escape occurred because the guards were
too busy watching the match.
	   Thai media reported that the inmates sawed through their cell
bars and fled the detention facility in Rayong, 145 kilometers (90
miles) south of Bangkok, after televised coverage of the match
began at 2 a.m. local time Sunday.
	   Officials rejected speculation that lax attention because of the
World Cup enabled the escape, telling Thai radio that heavy rain at
the time prevented officers from making their customary external
rounds of the jail.
	   Thirty-two more inmates could have escaped but did not, possibly
out of fear, Thai radio said. The escapees, six serving time for
vagrancy and two for fighting, were still at large late Sunday.

	   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Police and soldiers on Sunday
prevented Protestant marchers taking their annual parade through
Portadown's Catholic enclave, determined to prevent clashes that
could once again ignite this troubled province.
	   After a service at nearby Drumcree Anglican church, some 1,500
members of the Orange Order, Northern Ireland's main Protestant
brotherhood, marched up to barricades erected at the top of
Portadown's mainly Catholic Garvaghy Road, the Orangmen's chosen
route back into town.
	   Local Orange Order leaders tried to hand a letter of complaint
to police before turning around and heading back toward Drumcree,
where thousands of other Orangemen were gathering from across the
province. But no officer came forward to talk to them.
	   The protest was peaceful and there were no incidents. The
Orangemen have vowed to stand firm until they are allowed through.

	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Powered by an electric inning by
captain Arjuna Ranatunga, Sri Lanka outplayed lackluster New
Zealand Sunday to cruise into the final of the three-nation
Independence Cup cricket tournament.
	   Defending their total of 293, the Sri Lankans were never far
from victory as the New Zealanders lost wickets at regular
intervals before being bundled out for 206 in 39.1 overs.
	   To book a berth in Tuesday's final against India, New Zealand
needed to score the required runs in 41.4 overs.
	   Only Nathan Astle (74) and Chris Cairns (28) looked set to push
New Zealand close to the hosts' total at one stage in the game, but
they got out in successive overs.
	   Astle, who opened the innings, clobbered six fours and three
sixes but in his attempt to increase the run rate cut a delivery
from leg-spinner Upul Chandana into the hands of Aravinda de Silva
at short extra-cover.
	   Cairns was ruled out by home umpire Peter Manuel, caught behind
off Muttiah Muralitheran, after some hesitation.
	   Cairns struck two huge sixes, one off left arm spinner Sanath
Jayasuriya which sailed out of the ground over long-off.
	   New Zealand bowed out of the tournament, unable to win a single
match, with four of their six matches washed out by rain.
	   Captain Arjuna Ranatunga played a major part in carrying Sri
Lanka to their match-winning total when he lashed New Zealand
bowlers in the face of some sloppy fielding to record his fourth
one-day century in his 240th match.
	   Ranatunga cracked 102 in 98 balls with six fours and two sixes
as his team stretched the New Zealanders, who won the toss and
decided to field first.
	   Ranatunga and his deputy Aravinda de Silva (62) shared a 132-run
stand for the third wicket as they built up the innings after
opener Romesh Kaluwitharana laid a strong foundation with 54 runs
in 64 balls.
	   The stand between Ranataunga and De Silva lasted 23 overs and
ended when Stephen Fleming at short third-man picked up a diving
catch off Chris Harris to get rid of De Silva with the total at 224
in the 41st over.

Australian Walsh scores first victory in Asian Formula 2000 series
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australia's Ben Walsh followed up
a morning runner-up finish with his first victory in the Asian
Formula 2000 auto racing series Sunday.
	   Malaysia's Ng Wai Leong, the standings leader with 94 points,
won Round 5 in 19 minutes, 13.59 seconds, with Walsh second in
19:17.03 at the Johor Circuit in Pasir Gudang, the Bernama news
agency reported.
	   In Round 6, Walsh won in 19:16.00 after passing Thailand's H.
Nattaphong, who had led for the first 10 laps. Nattaphong was
second in 19:16.97, climbing to 79 points in the standings, and Ng
was third in 19:17.39.
	   Nattaphong crashed out in the first lap in Round 5.
	   ``This is my first time out in Pasir Gudang and it is good to
finish it off with a win and a second placing. It has also made the
series more thrilling,'' said Walsh.
	   Ng said, ``My car developed steering problems. I am looking
forward to the next round in China.''

Heavy bombardments reported in Guinea-Bissau
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Government forces shelled rebel
positions in Guinea-Bissau's capital Sunday in the heaviest
bombardment in the former Portuguese colony since a military
faction mutinied a month ago, according to reports.
	   Senegalese troops supporting President Joao Bernardo Vieira
shelled the rebels, who were dug into positions at Bissau airport
and in nearby military garrisons, Portuguese state television RTP
reported.
	   RTP quoted a rebel spokesman as saying that they were preparing
a counterattack.
	   There were no reports of fighting in the interior of the country
Sunday. Portuguese media reported last week that fighting had
spread from the capital of Bissau to inland towns.
	   Vieira denied reports that forces from neighboring Senegal were
involved in the interior clashes.
	   ``There are no Senegalese troops inside Guinea-Bissau, apart
from the capital,'' Vieira said in an interview broadcast on RTP
late Saturday.
	   Vieira was filmed walking through the streets of the deserted
capital. He reiterated his insistence that he would negotiate
directly with the rebels only if they first put down their weapons.
	   The rebels, led by Brig. Ansumane Mane, said Vieira is corrupt
and must resign.
	   Portugal and Angola have been vainly attempting to mediate an
end to the conflict.
	   Vieira criticized Portugal for not being more critical of the
rebels.
	   The Portuguese Foreign Ministry in Lisbon said it was
``surprised'' by the accusation.
	   ``Portugal was the first to condemn the coup,'' a spokesman told
The Associated Press, on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Vieira has ruled Guinea-Bissau, a country of about one million
people, since seizing power in a military coup in 1980. He won the
country's first elections in 1991.
	   The conflict erupted after Vieira accused Mane of selling arms
to Casamance separatists fighting the Senegalese government. Mane
said it was Vieira who was trafficking arms to the region.

Somali faction leaders fly to Libya
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ Three top Mogadishu faction leaders
were among 40 Somalis who flew to Libya on Sunday at the invitation
of President Moammar Gadhafi.
	   The three are Ali Mahdi Mohamed, who controls northern
Mogadishu, and Hassan Osman Ali, known as Atto, and Hussein Aidid,
both vying for control of the southern part.
	   Other people in the delegation include clergymen and
businessmen, a source close to one of the faction leaders said.
	   The Somalis are reportedly to take part Monday in celebrations
to mark the birth of Prophet Mohammed. Somalia is a predominantly
Muslim nation.
	   But the source also said the visit is expected to last 10 days.
	   The delegation flew from Ballidogle airport, about 90 kilometers
(56 miles) south of Mogadishu.
	   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Libya wants
to press the Somali leaders to resume talks on establishing a joint
administration in Mogadishu and reopening air and sea ports closed
due to factional rivalry.
	   The three Somalis agreed with other factions in Cairo in
December to form the Horn of Africa nation's first national
government since fighting began in 1991.
	   The factions also agreed to hold a reconciliation conference in
Feb. in the western town of Baidoa as the first step to
establishing a national government. The conference was postponed to
March, then May and then indefinitely.
	   In February, Aidid visited Tripoli, but Ali Mahdi and Atto,
decline Ghadafi's invitation.
	   Gadhafi is known to be close to Aidid and reportedly has
provided him with arms and other materiel for his militia.
	   The visit to Libya came two days after Aidid's militiamen
received a consignment of new uniforms. A source in Aidid's faction
said the uniforms came from Libya through Djibouti on the Gulf of
Aden.
	   Somalia has had no central government since the 1991 ouster of
the late dictator Mohamed Siad Barre and the country's
disintegration into fiefdoms protected by clan militias.

Arafat, Mubarak, King Hussein meet on stalled peace process
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES with quotes, leaders urging Israel to rescind
decision, Palestinian official urging more action.
 &UR; By ANTHONY SHADID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The deadlock in Middle East peace talks and
an Israeli plan to extend Jerusalem's borders could ignite violence
that may prove unstoppable, President Hosni Mubarak warned Sunday.
	   Mubarak met King Hussein of Jordan and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat in a brief and hastily called summit amid warnings that
tension over the deadlock had reached dangerous levels.
	   ``The present situation is very difficult,'' Mubarak said at a
news conference, flanked by Arafat and Hussein. ``We're afraid that
if the situation continues in this manner, violence will erupt.''
	   ``The Israeli government must understand that if the danger
begins, the situation will be very difficult to control,'' he said.
	   Israel's decision to extend Jerusalem's municipal services to
West Bank Jewish settlements has angered Palestinians, who accuse
Israel of violating the Israeli-Palestinian accords by unilaterally
making decisions on Jerusalem's future.
	   The plan, approved June 21 by the Israeli Cabinet, also calls
for the annexation of Jewish suburbs inside Israel to ensure the
Jewish majority of 70 percent in Jerusalem, where Palestinians hope
to set up the capital of a future state.
	   The three leaders urged Israel to rescind the decision, and
Mubarak warned the tension ``will hurt the Israeli people.''
	   The United States has proposed that Israel withdraw from 13
percent more of the West Bank as a way to revive talks that have
been stalled since March 1997 when Israel began building a Jewish
housing unit in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
	   The Palestinians have accepted the proposal. Israel has not.
	   The tension almost erupted into violence last week when Israeli
and Palestinian troops confronted each other with assault rifles
and armored personnel carriers in what began as an argument over
control of a road in the Gaza Strip.
	   A compromise reached with the help of U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis
Ross ended the standoff before anyone was hurt.
	   The three leaders met last in September, and both Arafat and
Hussein returned home soon after the summit ended Sunday.
	   Some, however, criticized the meeting.
	   David Bar-Illan, a top aide to Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, said that by convening the summit, ``the Palestinians
are hoping to create pressure on Israel.''
	   ``This will not work,'' he said.
	   Palestinian Cabinet Secretary Ahmed Abdel Rahman told the Voice
of Palestine radio station that meetings themselves were not
enough, and that Arab countries should freeze relations with Israel
until it ``commits itself to the peace process.''
	   Abdel Rahman said a full Arab summit should be convened at which
Arab countries take real action against Israel.
	   Mubarak said such a summit would be convened only at the
``appropriate time'' as a last resort.

World Cup: Brazil sees hand of fate in Netherlands matchup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: DELETES reference to Zagallo's first stint as coach in fifth
graf. &QL; 
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OZOIR-LA-FERREIERE, France (AP) _ With the Dutch once again in
Brazil's path to the World Cup title, coach Mario Zagallo sees more
than history. He senses destiny.
	   ``We cannot fight it,'' he said. ``Destiny is inscribed. Our
destiny is the Netherlands.''
	   Many Brazilians were gearing up to face South American rival
Argentina when fate and Dennis Bergkamp stepped in. The Dutch
striker's last-minute goal on Saturday snapped a 1-1 tie with
Argentina and moved the Netherlands into the Cup semifinals.
	   It will be the third time Brazil _ and Zagallo _ have faced the
Dutch in a World Cup. The 66-year-old coach has special reason to
remember the first _ it was the only Cup he's lost in five tries as
player, coach or team coordinator.
	   The year was 1974, and defending champion Brazil drew the
``Clockwork Orange'' in the semifinals. Johan Cruyff and company
dispatched Brazil 2-0, and Zagallo, as coach, was accused of
underestimating one of the greatest teams of all time.
	   Twenty years later, the two met again in a quarterfinal game
that many considered the best of the '94 Cup. Losing 2-0, the Dutch
battled back to tie it 2-2 before Branco got the winner on a
curling free kick just inside the post.
	   Zagallo, who was the technical coordinator in 1994, has a lot of
respect for the Dutch, and even picked the Netherlands as a
candidate to win it all.
	   ``They have a refined ball touch and great individual talent,''
he said. ``It's impressive that they can lose a player like (Marc)
Overmars and not feel the difference.''
	   But beyond their rivalry, the Brazilians have a special
admiration for Dutch soccer artistry. They speak reverently of the
great Dutch teams of the '70s and lament the slow death of ``art
soccer.''
	   Rinus Michels, the Dutch coach in 1974, recently was quoted as
saying the two teams that showed the world something new in soccer
were his Clockwork Orange and Brazil's 1970 World Cup champions
with Pele, Jairzinho, Rivelino and Tostao.
	   ``I agree completely,'' Zagallo said. ``In 1970, we played
beautiful football. In 1974, it was exactly the same with the
Dutch.''
	   Both teams had virtuoso players in constant movement, a virtue
that Zagallo tries to teach Ronaldo.
	   ``They were players with a high IQ,'' he said. ``They had to be
intelligent to understand what the coach wanted. To perform those
movements, any mistake would be fatal.''
	   For Zagallo, the ``carousel'' conceived by Michels in 1974 was a
high point of art soccer
	   ``It was totally different from anything we've seen before or
since,'' he said. ``Even the Dutch could never repeat it.''
	   Despite flashes of brilliance by today's stars, that kind of
soccer is gone for good, he says.
	   ``Today, football is totally different,'' Zagallo said. ``With
the physical development and the speed imposed, the spaces are
minimal. Thinking has to be a lot faster.''
	   ``Today, the idea is not to let the other team play,'' he added
wistfully. ``Back then, we played football.''

Marines tie record with 16-game losing streak
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Chiba Lotte Orions not only tied the Japanese
professional record by extending their losing streak to 16 games
Sunday, they did it by giving up the most hits in any game so far
this season _ 21.
	   The embarrassing 10-3 loss to the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks also came
at home in Chiba. The Hawks extended their winning streak to five
with their heavy hitting attack against four Marines' pitchers.
	   With a 23-41 record, the Marines were 18 games behind the
Pacific League-leading Nippon Ham Fighters, who capitalized on an
error by Seibu Lions' shortstop Kazuo Matsui for the tie-breaking
run in the sixth and went on to beat the Lions 5-2 at Tokyo Dome.
	   The Fighters are six games ahead of the Kintetsu Buffaloes, who
moved into second place with a 16-3 victory over the Orix BlueWave
at Kobe.
	   The Buffaloes rapped out 15 hits, including a two-run home run
by Phil Clark, against five pitchers. Clark, formerly with the
Boston Red Sox, has 11 homers.
	   In the Central League, Morihiro Komada doubled home two runs in
the nine-run sixth inning as the front-running Yokohama BayStars
beat the Yakult Swallows 11-5 at Kumamoto.
	   The BayStars are two games ahead of the Chunichi Dragons, who
lost 2-1 to the Yomiuri Giants at Nagoya Dome.
	   Balvino Galvez, formerly with the Texas Rangers, limited the
Dragons to eight scattered hits for his sixth victory against six
defeats this season.
	   The Giants scored two runs in the fifth inning on singles by
Kazuhiro Kiyohara and rookie Yoshinobu Takahashi.
	   At Hiroshima, Akira Etoh went 3-for-4 and drove in four runs
with a three-run home run in the first inning and a one-run single
in the second as the Hiroshima Toyo Carp beat the Hanshin Tigers
6-2.
	   Etoh has 17 homers and leads the league.

Sampras goes for 5th Wimbledon title; Ivanisevic after first
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with first set, adds byline &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Ivanisevic, struggling with his serve,
still won the first set 7-6 and 7-2 in the tiebreaker with 13 aces
to none for Sampras, the defending champion.
	   Ivanisevic also double faulted nine times in the first set of
the Wimbledon final Sunday and saved six break points in the set.
	   Sampras and Ivanisevic held their first two service games,
although the Croatian struggled. In the first game Ivanisevic
served two double faults and still won. In the third, he double
faulted twice and faced four break points and survived.
	   They held their next two service games to go 4-4. In the ninth
the erratic Ivanisevic saved one break point, doubled faulted four
times and still won the game to lead 5-4.
	   Sampras, holding his serve more easily, won the 10th to even the
set in a match played under the sunniest skies during the Wimbledon
fortnight.
	   Ivanisevic saved another break point in the 11th game and hit
two mores aces with Sampras holding easily in the 12th game.
	   Ivanisevic showed he was more than just a serve, hitting a
backhand winner down the baeline and a forehand cross-court winner
to go up 5-2 in the tiebreaker as he then served out to win 7-2.
	   Top-seeded Sampras was favored to win his fifth Wimbledon
singles title _ matching the five won by Bjorn Borg _ when he faced
14th-seeded Ivanisevic, who was seeking his first Wimbledon title
in three tries.
	   Sampras and Ivanisevic, both 26, met in the 1994 final with
Sampras winning in three sets, including 6-0 in the third.
Ivanisevic also lost in the '92 final to Andre Agassi.
	   A win would give Sampras 11 Grand Slam titles, tying him with
Borg and Rod Laver for second place on the all-time list. Roy
Emerson holds the men's record with 12 titles.
	   Ivanisevic, going for his first Grand Slam singles title, has
seen his ranking slump to 25th after being a top-five player.
	   London bookmakers listed Sampras as a 1-3 favorite, in part
because he's 4-0 in Wimbledon finals and 26-1 on Centre Court, with
the only loss in the 1996 quarterfinals to eventual champion
Richard Krajicek.
	   Sampras is also 10-2 in Grand Slam finals.
	   The left-handed Ivanisevic, a Croatian who celebrated his
country's 3-0 semifinal World Cup upset over Germany on Friday, has
_ like Sampras _ one of the game's biggest serves.
	   The 6-foot-4 (1.94-meter) Croatian trails the series with
Sampras 10-6 and had won only one of the last eight matches.
They've played twice at Wimbledon _ Sampras won in straight sets in
the '94 final and won in five sets in the 1995 semifinals.
	   Though Sampras entered as the favorite, he had failed to reach
the semifinals in the past three majors. This year Sampras' results
have been so far below par that if he loses Sunday, he'll drop to
No. 2 in the rankings behind Marcelo Rios of Chile.

World Cup: Klinsmann says he may quit soccer altogether
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; WITH Sports-Soccer-German Decline &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NICE, France (AP) _ Juergen Klinsmann, the German captain who
played his last national team game in the 3-0 loss to Croatia in
the World Cup quarterfinals, said Sunday he may quit soccer
altogether.
	   ``I'll go away with my family for a couple of months and then
decide whether to go on at all,'' Klinsmann said.
	   Klinsmann spoke less than 24 hours after the German team's
stunning loss in Lyon. The Germans returned to their headquarters
outside Nice during the night and some players already had left
France.
	   ``I'll think things over without rushing in the next couple of
months,'' Klinsmann said.
	   ``My intention was to play well and do everything for the team.
I'd have loved to have gone to Paris and to get my final and 110th
cap in the final. I am greatly disappointed,'' Klinsmann said.
	   ``There is a feeling of great emptiness. But I am proud to have
been able to play for this team and to have been its captain,''
Klinsmann said.
	   He was one of the better members of the disappointing German
squad, and scored three goals.
	   Klinsmann, who will be 34 on July 30, finished his 11-year
international career with 108 caps and 47 goals _ sharing second
place on the all-time German scoring list with Rudi Voeller. Gerd
Mueller had 68 goals in 62 games.
	   The German captain had 11 goals in three World Cup tournaments.
He won the World Cup title with Germany in 1990.
	   Klinsmann said he may retire fully from soccer for ``purely
familial grounds.''
	   ``I have a 15-month-old son who needs and whom I need
desperately,'' Klinsmann said. ``I want to be there for him and for
my wife.''
	   ``Our physicians tell me I could go on, I am very fit
physically. But I always thought of this World Cup as the possible
end,'' he said.
	   Klinsmann, who played for Stuttgart and Bayern Munich in the
Bundesliga, also played club soccer in Italy, France and England.
	   There have been reports that he may go the Major League Soccer
in the United States. Klinsmann's wife is American.

Turkey's top general rejects accusations of army entering politics
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ An unusual public dispute sharpened Sunday
when Turkey's highest-ranking officer rejected government criticism
that the military was over-stepping its bounds in countering an
Islamic political movement.
	   The armed forces ``will continue to do their duty within the
legal framework ... and with utmost care to stay out of politics,''
the chief of general staff, Gen. Ismail Hakki Karadayi, said after
meeting with the country's top brass.
	   Karadayi also cited what he called a desire to ``weaken'' the
army, saying the effort was undeserved.
	   The army plays a powerful role in Turkish society. It has taken
over the country three times since 1960, and a year ago effectively
forced out an Islamic party leader as prime minister.
	   The military also sees itself as guardian of secular
institutions and traditions of modern Turkey, an overwhelmingly
Muslim country.
	   The latest display of friction between the government and
military started June 29, when Karadayi's deputy, Gen. Cevik Bir,
declared that ``religious fundamentalism'' was the country's No. 1
threat.
	   He pointedly said that the pro-Islamic Virtue Party was still
Turkey's largest party according to recent opinion polls.
	   Turkey's government leaders bristled.
	   Deputy Premier Bulent Ecevit accused Bir of boosting Virtue's
moral ahead of general elections set for next April.
	   ``It is impossible to leave the whole struggle to the armed
forces,'' Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said Saturday. ``The power
and final word on drawing up a policy belong to the government,''
added Yilmaz, who came to power last year after the Islamic
party-dominated government was ousted.

Arafat, Mubarak, King Hussein meet on stalled peace process
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with leaders urging Israel to rescind
decision, Palestinian official urging more action, Israel
responding to conference. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANTHONY SHADID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The deadlock in Middle East peace talks and
an Israeli plan to extend Jerusalem's borders could ignite violence
that may prove unstoppable, President Hosni Mubarak warned Sunday.
	   Mubarak met King Hussein of Jordan and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat in a brief and hastily called summit amid warnings that
tension over the deadlock had reached dangerous levels.
	   ``The present situation is very difficult,'' Mubarak said at a
news conference, flanked by Arafat and Hussein. ``We're afraid that
if the situation continues in this manner, violence will erupt.''
	   ``The Israeli government must understand that if the danger
begins, the situation will be very difficult to control,'' he said.
	   Israel's decision to extend Jerusalem's municipal services to
West Bank Jewish settlements has angered Palestinians, who accuse
Israel of violating the Israeli-Palestinian accords by unilaterally
making decisions on Jerusalem's future.
	   The plan, approved June 21 by the Israeli Cabinet, also calls
for the annexation of Jewish suburbs inside Israel to ensure the
Jewish majority of 70 percent in Jerusalem, where Palestinians hope
to set up the capital of a future state.
	   The three leaders urged Israel to rescind the decision, and
Mubarak warned the tension ``will hurt the Israeli people.''
	   Peace talks between Israel and Palestinians have been stalled
since March 1997 when Israel began building a Jewish housing unit
in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
	   The United States has tried to revive the talks with a proposal
for Israel to withdraw from another 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   The Palestinians have accepted the proposal. Israel has not.
	   The tension almost erupted into violence last week when Israeli
and Palestinian troops confronted each other with assault rifles
and armored personnel carriers in what began as an argument over
control of a Gaza Strip road.
	   A compromise reached with the help of U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis
Ross ended the standoff before anyone was hurt.
	   The three leaders last met in September, and both Arafat and
Hussein returned home soon after the summit ended Sunday.
	   David Bar-Illan, a top aide to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, said that by convening the summit, ``the Palestinians
are hoping to create pressure on Israel.''
	   ``This will not work,'' he said.
	   Palestinian Cabinet Secretary Ahmed Abdel Rahman told the Voice
of Palestine radio station that meetings themselves were not
enough, and that Arab countries should freeze relations with Israel
until it ``commits itself to the peace process.''
	   Abdel Rahman said a full Arab summit should be convened at which
Arab countries take real action against Israel.
	   Mubarak said such a summit would be convened only at the
``appropriate time'' and as a last resort.

Summit of highest peak in England and Wales is for sale
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ For sale: the summit of Mount Snowdon, highest
peak in England and Wales, and more than 4,000 prime acres (1,600
hectares) in the scenic Snowdonia National Park.
	   Farmer Richard Williams, whose family has run this prime estate
for generations, confirmed Sunday he is asking some 3 million
pounds (dlrs 4.8 million) for about one third of the 3,557-foot
(1,084-meter) Mount Snowdon.
	   Williams, one of three landlords whose estates reach the summit,
wants to concentrate on his farm in another part of Wales.
	   Williams' family bought the land in 1920, having worked it as
tenants since the 17th century. He inherited it when his
grandfather died in 1988.
	   ``In addition to the prestige of owning one third of Mount
Snowdon's summit, I hope the purchaser will gain enormous pleasure
from farming some 4,000 acres (1,600 hectares) of Wales' most
beautiful and historic countryside,'' he said.
	   ``The decision to sell the property, which has been in our
family so long, has caused me much heartache. Over the past 10
years, however, I have been farming both the Snowdonia estate and
my estate in Anglesey, and this has left little time for me to be
with my family and pursue other interests.''
	   Half a million people visit Mount Snowdon each year; some 6
million visit the Snowdonia National Park to walk, climb, fish and
enjoy the panoramic views.
	   Included in the sale are two profitable farms, several houses
and cottages, a camp site, the kennels of a fox hunt and an outdoor
pursuits center.
	   ``This is perhaps the most significant landmark to come onto the
market since Lands End and John O'Groats were sold in January
1995,'' said Tony Pardoe of agents Carter Jonas.

	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Tens of thousands of Croats partied till
dawn Sunday, celebrating the World Cup triumph over mighty Germany
_ the biggest in the young nation's eight-year history.
	   People exploded with joy when the team advanced to the
semifinals Saturday by pounding three-time winner Germany, 3-0.
Tens of thousands of revelers poured into the streets of the
capital Zagreb singing, dancing and dousing one another with
champagne.
	   By early Sunday banners fluttering from apartment houses in
Zagreb reading ``We are the champions'' still echoed the pride.
	   Croatia has not seen such a massive celebrations since 1991,
when it fulfilled its decades-old desire to break away from the
former Yugoslavia as an independent country.
	   ``We are a small nation; many in the world did not even know
that we existed,'' Ante Zupan, 33-year-old electrician said, almost
crying of joy. ``Now they'll know.''
	   President Franjo Tudjman, 76, who attended the match in Lyon,
said the victory ``boosts our confidence but it also raises our
reputation in the world ... It's great to be the winner.''
	   Giving soccer giant Germany its heaviest loss since in the World
Cup since 1954 was not only a huge upset, but a sweet revenge for
Germany's 2-0 victory in the 1996 European Championship.
	   And while Germany has traditionally backed Croatia, as the first
country to recognize their independence in 1991 _ a move which some
argue sparked bloody war that spread to Bosnia and ripped apart the
former Yugoslavia _ for one night, Croats also forgot their
gratitude.
	   ``Danke Deutschland (Thank you, Germany),'' giggled Damir Skaro,
a former boxer and a parliament deputy, playing with the popular
motto and a refrain of a song made at the time when Germany,
recognized Croatia.
	   ``Auf wiedersehen,'' echoed through the streets of Lyon, France
following the game.
	   At home, it was hard to find anyone in the country of 4.5
million who did not watch the match on TV. Bars carried the game
alive on the big screens and no one went to sleep. Shops were
closed earlier because they expected no customers.
	   In Zagreb, 40 people were reported admitted to the hospitals,
with a slight injuries. Several shops and tram windows were
smashed.
	   A 24-year-old man died during the celebrations in Vukovar in
eastern Croatia when he slipped off the truck that was carrying him
through the town.
	   In the divided city of Mostar in neighboring Bosnia, a Muslim
woman Emina Catic, 25, was killed and a man was seriously wounded
on the Muslim side, when hit by bullets fired in celebrations from
the Croat side, Bosnian radio reported.
	   Croats will may hardly have time to catch their breath before
the next round of celebrating begins, should Goran Ivanisevic beat
defending champion Pete Sampras in the Wimbledon tennis tournament
Sunday.

Somali faction leaders fly to Libya
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ Three top Mogadishu faction leaders
flew to Libya on Sunday as part of a Libyan President Moammar
Gadhafi's effort to try to reduce tension in the Somali capital,
according to a source close to one of the faction leaders.
	   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Libya wants
to press the Somali leaders to resume talks on establishing a joint
administration in Mogadishu and reopening air and sea ports closed
due to factional rivalry.
	   Ali Mahdi Mohamed, Hassan Osman Ali, known as Atto, and Hussein
Aidid joined clergy and business leaders on the trip, the source
said.
	   Somalia has had no central government since the 1991 ouster of
the late dictator Mohamed Siad Barre, and the country's
disintegration into fiefdoms protected by clan militias.
	   The three Somalis agreed with other factions in Cairo in
December to form the Horn of Africa nation's first national
government since fighting began in 1991.
	   The factions also agreed to hold a reconciliation conference in
February as the first step toward establishing a national
government. The conference has been postponed indefinitely.
	   In February, Aidid visited Tripoli, but Ali Mahdi and Atto
declined Gadhafi's invitation.
	   Gadhafi is known to be close to Aidid and reportedly has
provided him with arms.
	   The leader's visit to Libya is expected to last 10 days. They
are reportedly to take part Monday in celebrations to mark the
birth of the prophet Mohammed. Somalia is a predominantly Muslim
nation.

Heat wave kills three more in Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Another three people died Sunday as Japan's
abnormal heat wave continued for a third day, a national news
agency reported.
	   That brought the death toll for the three days to seven.
	   In Tokyo, where the early July average temperature is 26.5
degrees Celsius (80 F), thermometers climbed to 36.1 (97 F)
Saturday and 31.6 (90 F) Sunday, the Central Meteorological Agency
said.
	   Kyodo News said two men, aged 85 and 73, died of sunstroke while
doing farm work in areas north of Tokyo Sunday.
	   In Shizuoka, 150 kilometers (94 miles) west of Tokyo, a
4-month-old baby died in a park car while the parents were swimming
at a beach, Kyodo said. The temperature there was 35.5 (96 F).
	   Kyodo said more than 50 other people were taken to hospitals
with sunstroke.
	   In Tokyo alone, seven people were hospitalized with sunstroke
Sunday, compared with 53 Saturday, said Mikio Endoh of the Tokyo
Fire Department.
	   The Tokyo area usually remains cool during a monthlong rainy
season that ordinarily lasts until mid-July, but a high pressure
area now is covering Japan, the Meteorological Agency said.

Summit of highest peak in England and Wales is for sale
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES in graf 2 that Snowdonia is in northwest Wales;
Williams family has had estate for 14 generations &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ For sale: the summit of Mount Snowdon, highest
peak in England and Wales, and more than 4,000 prime acres (1,600
hectares) in the scenic Snowdonia National Park, including farms, a
campsite and an outdoor pursuits center.
	   Farmer Richard Williams, whose family has occupied the estate in
northwest Wales for 14 generations, said Sunday he is asking at
least 3 million pounds (dlrs 4.8 million) for about one third of
the 3,557-foot (1,084-meter) Mount Snowdon.
	   Williams, one of three landlords whose estates reach the summit,
wants to concentrate on his farm in another part of Wales.
	   Williams' family bought the land in 1920, having worked it as
tenants since the 17th century. He inherited it when his
grandfather died in 1988.
	   ``In addition to the prestige of owning one third of Mount
Snowdon's summit, I hope the purchaser will gain enormous pleasure
from farming some 4,000 acres (1,600 hectares) of Wales' most
beautiful and historic countryside,'' he said.
	   ``The decision to sell the property, which has been in our
family so long, has caused me much heartache. Over the past 10
years, however, I have been farming both the Snowdonia estate and
my estate in Anglesey, and this has left little time for me to be
with my family and pursue other interests.''
	   Half a million people visit Mount Snowdon each year; some 6
million visit the Snowdonia National Park to walk, climb, fish and
enjoy the panoramic views.
	   Also included in the sale are two profitable farms, several
houses and cottages, a camp site, the kennels of a fox hunt and an
outdoor pursuits center.
	   ``This is perhaps the most significant landmark to come onto the
market since Lands End and John O'Groats were sold in January
1995,'' said Tony Pardoe of agents Carter Jonas.

Winds add another obstacle at Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS to UPDATE with Saturday results. &QL; 
 &UR; By ARNIE STAPLETON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KOHLER, Wisconsin (AP) _ Se Ri Pak shot a 75 on a windy to
retain a one-stroke lead heading into the final round of the U.S.
Women's Open.
	   Pak's lead appeared certain to be two strokes as she and playing
partner Liselotte Neumann dealt with the 18th hole, a water-lined
421-yard (385 meter) par-4 that has been the toughest to play on
the Blackwolf Run Golf Course.
	   Neumann's tee shot veered left into the water and Pak, her drive
in the middle of the fairway, put her approach shot on the fringe
of the green. A par would give Pak a two-stroke lead over unlikely
challenger Mhairi McKay, whose 73 Saturday left her at two over for
the tournament.
	   But as happened throughout the sunny and windy Saturday,
fortunes changed in an instant.
	   Neumann pitched in from the drop area about 70 yards (64 meters)
from the green for an unlikely par. Then Pak, appearing shaken by
the turn of events, three-putted for bogey and a one-stroke lead
over Neumann, who had a 75, and McKay.
	   Neumann and McKay went through the same problems trying to hold
the lead.
	   Neumann once was four under for the tournament, only to have
five straight bogeys on the back nine. She was looking at near
oblivion when her chip on 18 brought her back into the fight.
	   McKay, never in the top 20 of an LPGA tournament, was breezing
along, dropping some of the longest putts of the week. When she
came to the 17th hole, she looked at a leaderboard and saw she was
leading the tournament. Her tee shot on the par-3 17th went into
the water and she took a double bogey. It could have been worse but
she rattled in a 9-footer (3 meters) for the 5 that at least kept
her in touch with the leaders.
	   Then she bogeyed the 18th for a 73 and a 2-over 215 for 54
holes.
	   Already succumbing to the unforgiving Blackwolf Run Golf Course,
the field had to fight swirling winds whipping off Lake Michigan.
After only 19 players bettered par the first two days. None
finished in red figures on Saturday. McKay's 73 was as good as it
got.
	   Pak, the 20-year-old South Korean who won the LPGA Championship
in May, is seeking to become the first rookie to win two majors
since Juli Inkster won the Nabisco Dinah Shore and du Maurier Ltd.
Classic in 1984.
	   The last woman to win consecutive majors was Meg Mallon in 1991.
	   Chris Johnson, who had a 77, and amateur Jenny Chuasiriporn,
with a 75, were four strokes back.
	   McKay began the day three strokes off the lead after rounds of
72 and 70. And for most of the afternoon, McKay played steadily
while those around her were done in by the tricky course and the
topsy-turvy climate.
	   But on 17, she put her shot into the water and double-bogeyed,
falling from a one-stroke lead over Pak to one shot back.
	   Overnight rain drenched the course, softening the fast greens,
but that didn't help as much as Neumann had hoped.
	   As storm clouds gathered Friday night, Neumann said rain would
be a godsend for the third round.
	   ``Yes, please. That would be nice,'' she said. ``I think
everybody would definitely be able to be a little bit more
aggressive. And, I think it would definitely help the scores for
sure.''
	   Instead, scores soared, thanks to the gusts coming off the lake.
	   After the 36-hole cut was determined Saturday morning _ darkness
halted play Friday night with 21 golfers still on the course _ only
Neumann and Pak were under par halfway through the biggest event in
women's golf. Pak was the leader at 3-under 139, followed by
Neumann, winner of the 1988 Open.
	   Neumann birdied two of her first six holes to go four under, but
she bogeyed seven of the next nine holes. Pak fell back to even par
with a double-bogey on No. 10.
	   Annika Sorenstam, the 1995 and '96 Open winner who began the day
seven strokes back, saw her chances of winning a third title in
four years sink with a quintuple-bogey on No. 3, a 402-yard, par-4.
	   After adding a bogey on No. 6, a double-bogey on 7 and a bogey
on 8, she played the back nine one under to finish the day eight
over and the third round 12 over at 225.
	   The wind didn't bother Brandie Burton on No. 13 as she aced the
142-yard (130 meter) hole. It was the third straight day that there
was a hole-in-one in the Open, a record. Helen Alfredsson aced the
152-yard (139 meter) 8th hole Thursday and Clarissa Childs did the
same Friday.
	   Amy Geithner and Julie Stanger had holes-in-one in 1981 at
LaGrange, Illinois, and Pat Bradley and Jane Lock did it two years
later in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
	   ``It was pretty windy all over,'' said Karrie Webb, who was
three under after 13 holes Saturday before three bogeys and a
double-bogey on the final five holes left her with a 73 and 222.
	   Helen Alfredsson also shot a 73 for a 223.
	   ``I play well in the wind a lot, but it was really windy today,
and we don't play on courses this long,'' Webb said.
	   The 6,412-yard (5,861 meter) layout, second-longest in the
53-year history of the Open, has proven so merciless that several
golfers predicted nobody would master the Pete Dye-designed course
_ and that was before the winds came.
	   ``I think level par will win,'' 1987 winner Laura Davies said.

Gunmen attack passenger bus killing four people
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Masked gunmen attacked a passenger
bus with automatic rifles Sunday killing four people and wounding
two others, Pakistan's state-run news agency reported.
	   The bus was traveling in southwestern Baluchistan province, some
500 kilometers (300 miles) southwest of the federal capital of
Islamabad when seven men on motorcycles rode up beside the bus and
opened fire, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
	   No one has taken responsibility for the killings, and police
officers in the area have so far refused to speculate.
	   Two police officers were among the dead, although it was not
immediately clear whether they were targeted.
	   The bus driver and a passenger sitting in the adjacent seat also
were killed.
	   Police officials in the area are investigating.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Henri d'Orleans, the Count of Paris and pretender
to the French throne, celebrated his 90th birthday Sunday in the
company of many other royals cast aside by history.
	   Former Empress Farah of Iran came, as did Grand Duchess Maria of
Russia. Also present were a handful of Habsburgs, and royals from
Romania, Yugoslavia and Greece.
	   The count, a direct descendant of Louis-Phillipe, the last king
of France who abdicated in 1848, invited his friends to his
favorite castle at Amboise in the Loire Valley.
	   The no-shows included Prince Rainier of Monaco, but his son
Prince Albert said his father was simply ``tired'' and wasn't
suffering from any serious health problems.

	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Tens of thousands of Croats partied till
dawn Sunday, celebrating their World Cup triumph over mighty
Germany _ the biggest in their young nation's eight-year history.
	   People exploded with joy when the team advanced to the
semifinals Saturday by pounding three-time winner Germany 3-0. Tens
of thousands of revelers poured into the streets of the capital,
Zagreb, singing, dancing and dousing one another with champagne.
	   Banners fluttering from apartment houses in Zagreb early Sunday,
reading ``We are the champions,'' still echoed the pride.
	   Croatia has not seen such celebrations since 1991, when it
fulfilled its decades-old desire to break away from the former
Yugoslavia and become an independent country.
	   ``We are a small nation; many in the world did not even know
that we existed,'' said Ante Zupan, a 33-year-old electrician,
almost crying with joy. ``Now they'll know.''
	   President Franjo Tudjman, 76, who attended the match in Lyon,
France, said the victory ``boosts our confidence but it also raises
our reputation in the world. ... It's great to be the winner.''
	   Giving soccer giant Germany its heaviest loss in the World Cup
since 1954 was not only a huge upset, but sweet revenge for
Germany's 2-0 victory in the 1996 European Championship.
	   And while Germany has traditionally backed Croatia, as the first
country to recognize its independence in 1991 _ a move which some
say sparked the war that spread to Bosnia and ripped apart the
former Yugoslavia _ for one night, Croats forgot their gratitude.
	   ``Danke Deutschland (Thank you, Germany),'' giggled Damir Skaro,
a former boxer and a parliament deputy, playing with the popular
motto and refrain of a song made when Germany recognized Croatia.
	   ``Auf wiedersehen,'' echoed through the streets of Lyon after
the game.
	   At home, it was hard to find anyone in the country of 4.5
million who did not watch the match on TV. Bars carried the game
live on big screens and no one went to sleep. Shopkeepers closed
early because they expected no customers.
	   In Zagreb, 40 people were reported admitted to hospitals with
minor injuries. Several shops and tram windows were smashed.
	   A 24-year-old man died during the celebrations in Vukovar when
he slipped off a truck. In the divided city of Mostar in
neighboring Bosnia, a 25-year-old Muslim woman was killed and a man
was seriously wounded on the Muslim side when they were hit by
bullets fired in celebration from the Croat side, Bosnian radio
reported.
	   Croats may hardly have time to catch their breath before the
next round of celebrating begins, should Goran Ivanisevic beat
defending champion Pete Sampras in the Wimbledon tennis tournament
Sunday.

Sampras goes for 5th Wimbledon title; Ivanisevic after first
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with Sampras winning second set to even at 1-1 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Defending champion Pete Sampras won
the second set 7-6 (11-9) to pull even at one set each in Sunday's
Wimbledon men's final against Goran Ivanisevic.
	   Ivanisevic, going for his first Grand Slam title, won the first
set 7-6 (7-2).
	   In the second set, Sampras put the set away with the tiebreaker
at 9-9. Ivanisevic, serving, hit a forehand volley at the net long,
and then Sampras _ taking the serve _ hit a service winner to
Ivanisevic's forehand.
	   To open the second set, Sampras held serve and broke Ivanisevic
in the second game _ the first break of the match as Ivanisevic
doubled faulted twice to go down 15-40. He saved the first break
but Sampras broke on a backhand volley winner.
	   Ivanisevic broke right back in the third game. Sampras, down
15-40, saved two break points. On the third break point, Ivanisevic
missed a backhand passing shot and slammed his racket on the court
_ breaking it.
	   He played out the next point and won it, then changed rackets to
avoid a warning for racket abuse. He then won on the fourth break
point with a forehand passing shot.
	   Ivanisevic held serve in the fourth to put the match back on
serve. It stayed that way through the 12th at 6-6 with little
separating the two players as they both began to serve
consistenlty. Ivanisevic won more from the baseline and Sampras got
more more points at the net.
	   In the first set, Ivanisevic, struggled with his serve but still
held on with 13 aces to none for Sampras, the defending champion.
	   Ivanisevic also double faulted nine times in the first set and
saved six break points.
	   Sampras and Ivanisevic held their first two service games,
although the Croatian struggled. In the first game, Ivanisevic
served two double faults and still won. In the third, he double
faulted twice and faced four break points and survived.
	   They held their next two service games to go 4-4. In the ninth
the erratic Ivanisevic saved one break point, doubled faulted four
times and still took the game to lead 5-4. Sampras, holding his
serve more easily, won the 10th to even the set.
	   Ivanisevic saved another break point in the 11th game and hit
two mores aces with Sampras holding easily in the 12th game.
	   Ivanisevic showed he was more than just a serve, hitting a
backhand winner down the baeline and a forehand cross-court winner
to go up 5-2 in the tiebreaker as he then served out to win 7-2.
	   Top-seeded Sampras was favored to win his fifth Wimbledon
singles title _ matching the five won by Bjorn Borg _ when he faced
14th-seeded Ivanisevic, who was seeking his first Wimbledon title
in three tries.
	   Sampras and Ivanisevic, both 26, met in the 1994 final with
Sampras winning in three sets, including 6-0 in the third.
Ivanisevic also lost in the '92 final to Andre Agassi.
	   A win would give Sampras 11 Grand Slam titles, tying him with
Borg and Rod Laver for second place on the all-time list. Roy
Emerson holds the men's record with 12 titles.
	   Ivanisevic, going for his first Grand Slam singles title, has
seen his ranking slump to 25th after being a top-five player.
	   London bookmakers listed Sampras as a 1-3 favorite, in part
because he's 4-0 in Wimbledon finals and 26-1 on Centre Court, with
the only loss in the 1996 quarterfinals to eventual champion
Richard Krajicek.
	   Sampras is also 10-2 in Grand Slam finals.
	   The left-handed Ivanisevic, a Croatian who celebrated his
country's 3-0 semifinal World Cup upset over Germany on Friday, has
_ like Sampras _ one of the game's biggest serves.
	   The 6-foot-4 (1.94-meter) Croatian trails the series with
Sampras 10-6 and had won only one of the last eight matches.
They've played twice at Wimbledon _ Sampras won in straight sets in
the '94 final and won in five sets in the 1995 semifinals.
	   Though Sampras entered as the favorite, he had failed to reach
the semifinals in the past three majors. This year Sampras' results
have been so far below par that if he loses Sunday, he'll drop to
No. 2 in the rankings behind Marcelo Rios of Chile.

Dutch left back suffers fractured shin
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with fracture confirmed; EDITS to conform. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) _ Dutch left back Winston Bogarde
suffered a fractured shin in Sunday's training and was taken to a
local hospital via ambulance.
	   ``It is serious,'' Dutch coach Guus Hiddink said. ``He is now in
the hospital in Monaco and we have to see if he will undergo
surgery in Amsterdam or if a surgeon will be flown here.''
	   The 27-year-old Bogarde tripped trying to maneuver around
Boudewijn Zenden in a morning scrimmage. He fractured the fibula,
the smaller of the two bones that run from the knee to the ankle,
in his right leg. His injury causes major problems for the Dutch
defense heading into Tuesday's World Cup semifinal match against
Brazil.
	   ``It is a terrible disappointment for him personally and for the
team after the euphoria of yesterday,'' Hiddink said.
	   Bogarde, who has appeared twice as a substitute during the World
Cup, was expected to start Tuesday's semifinal match against Brazil
due to the unavailability of regular left back Arthur Numan.
	   Numan received two yellow cards in Saturday's 2-1 quarterfinal
victory over Argentina and must serve an automatic one-game
suspension.
	   Without Numan and Bogarde, Hiddink will have to scramble to form
a back line.
	   Marc Overmars, who entered the Argentina game as a second-half
substitute, is still doubtful due a hamstring injury suffered in
Thursday's training.
	   That would likely force Phillip Cocu to take over Overmars place
in left midfield.
	   The only other defender listed among the Netherlands' reserves
is Andre Ooijer, who is a natural right back and also is injured.

World Cup: Germany faces uncertain future
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NICE, France (AP) _ Juergen Klinsmann, Juergen Kohler, Lothar
Matthaeus, possibly Andreas Koepke, Olaf Thon. The German veterans
are retiring, leaving behind them a big hole and an uncertain
future for the shaken powerhouse.
	   No new generation seems ready to step in and Germany may face a
long drought, at least by its standards. The European champion may
have to go back to the basics of winning games rather than titles.
	   ``We'll have to set our standards lower,'' former star and
national team coach Franz Beckenbauer told German television.
``Times will get even tougher for us.''
	   If the quarterfinal loss to Bulgaria four years ago in the
United States was considered an accident, Saturday's 3-0 thrashing
by World Cup rookie Croatia exposed all German weaknesses. Never
before had Germany lost two World Cup quarterfinals in a row.
	   The Germans arrived in France as reigning European champions,
with the aim of winning their fourth World Cup title. They left
empty-handed, dejected and aware that they have fallen behind the
world's best in skill.
	   Their midfield was all but invisible, with Andy Moeller once
again a big disappointment.
	   They displayed uncharacteristic defensive shortcomings, with
even goalkeeper Koepke, usually a rock of reliability, below his
par.
	   The only two who did their job were Klinsmann and his forward
partner Oliver Bierhoff, who had three goals apiece.
	   The aging team, the oldest in the tournament with an average age
of just under 30, looked old, not only in age but also in tactics.
	   By the second game, it was painfully visible that the Germans
were very vulnerable. They escaped with a 2-2 draw against
Yugoslavia, after trailing 2-0. The fighting spirit was all that
was left.
	   In the second round against Mexico, only Bierhoff's late goal
clinched a 2-1, come-from-behind victory.
	   Croatia came in with determination and cleverness and blew
Germany away.
	   The Germans blamed poor refereeing for their loss, after having
defender Christian Woerns sent off in the 40th minute. But few
other big teams collapsed so completely after going a man down.
	   Coach Berti Vogts, who took over in 1990, after Germany won its
last title, made no immediate decision on whether to stay on.
	   ``There have been some very peculiar decisions against the
German team. Maybe there were some instructions. Perhaps the German
soccer was too successful and now had to be punished,'' Vogts said
Sunday about the refereeing. It was a poor excuse.
	   Vogts praised his team's ``character.''
	   ``It trained hard and it fought hard, but it wasn't enough,''
Vogts said.
	   ``We need a new beginning, we'll have to make a big cut. We want
to defend our European title in 2000.''
	   ``We'll have to sit down and analyze the situation without
emotion, in tranquility,'' Vogts said.
	   ``I'll be thinking about rebuilding the team without rushing
myself, but I must have the players necessary for that.''
	   There are few young German stars on the horizon. Its junior
teams have not won anything for a long time.
	   Vogts blamed the Bosman ruling for the state of German soccer.
By bringing in cheap foreigners, Bundesliga clubs have neglected
young German players, who are often left on the bench.
	   ``We'll have to develop a concept, we want to put our flagship
on the right course again,'' Vogts said.
	   To do that, Vogts wants the Bundesliga clubs to accept a a new
rule that would oblige every club to start two German Under-23
players.
	   Asked if he thought he could get his plan pushed through, Vogts
conceded, ``With great difficulty.
	   ``If we want to remain among the best in the world, we should
not reject this idea,'' he said.
	   ``Don't be surprised if some players who are not starters in
their clubs are nominated in the national team,'' Vogts said.
	   Bierhoff is expected to stay on, but he is already 30.
	   Thomas Helmer, Thomas Haessler, Stefan Reuter, Ulf Kirsten and
Moeller are all over 30 and thought to be thinking of retirement.
	   The new era for Germany begins Oct. 10, when it plays Turkey in
its first qualifying game for the 2000 European Championship. With
what lineup is anyone's guess.

World Cup: Bogarde injury casts shadow over Dutch victory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTE-CARLO, Monaco (AP) _ Dutch euphoria at reaching their
third World Cup semifinal was shattered Sunday as reserve left back
Winston Bogarde was hospitalized with a fractured right fibula.
	   ``It is a terrible disappointment for him personally and for the
team after the euphoria of yesterday,'' Dutch coach Guus Hiddink
said.
	   Bogarde was taken by ambulance to a hospital in Monaco following
the incident during a Dutch intrasquad scrimmage.
	   ``We have to see if he will be operated on in Amsterdam or if a
surgeon will be flown here,'' Hiddink added.
	   The injury could not have come at a worse time for Barcelona's
Bogarde. He would have started his first World Cup match Tuesday in
the Dutch semifinal against Brazil due to the unavailability of
regular left back Arthur Numan.
	   Numan must sit out an automatic one-game suspension for
receiving two yellow cards in Saturday's 2-1 quarterfinal victory
over Argentina.
	   Bogarde had appeared twice as a substitute earlier in the
tournament.
	   His injury also leaves Hiddink with a defensive headache as he
prepares to take on one of the world's most feared attacking
lineups.
	   With Numan and his most obvious replacement definitely
sidelined, the Dutch may again have to call on Phillip Cocu to play
out of position.
	   The versatile left-footed midfielder who will play for Barcelona
next season already has played in the midfield and as a striker for
the Dutch at this World Cup.
	   Hiddink did not say Sunday how he would solve the problem, which
is compounded by a hamstring injury to Marc Overmars meaning he
likely will not start Tuesday's semifinal in Marseille.
	   ``I hope he can play, but I have my doubts,'' Hiddink told
reporters.
	   Sunday's training session, which ended with Bogarde's injury,
started in high spirits as a small crowd of Dutch fans cheered each
player off the team bus following Saturday's 2-1 victory over
Argentina.
	   The victory puts the Dutch in the last four for the third time
at a World Cup. They won their two other semifinals, in 1974 and
1978, but went on to lose each final, first to West Germany and
then to Argentina.
	   Although clearly shaken by Bogarde's injury, Hiddink paid
tribute to his team's performance against an Argentina side tipped
by many to win the tournament.
	   `We played excellently yesterday,'' Hiddink said. ``The way we
played against a great team and a great footballing nation, it
earns international respect and we are very happy with that.''
	   The victory kept Hiddink's World Cup schedule on track.
	   ``Months ago we planned to go home on July 13 (the day after the
final) and we are still on target,'' He said.

	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ Three top Mogadishu faction leaders
flew to Libya on Sunday as part of a Libyan President Moammar
Gadhafi's effort to try to bridge differences between the men.
	   A source close to one of the faction leaders, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Libya wants to press the Somali
leaders to resume talks on establishing a joint administration in
Mogadishu and reopening air and sea ports closed due to factional
rivalry.

Orangemen launch `battle of wills' with Northern Ireland peace on

	   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland _ Northern Ireland's long-dominant
Protestant brotherhood launched a dangerous ``battle of wills''
Sunday with British security forces barring them from this town's
main Catholic neighborhood.
	   At midday, more than 1,000 Portadown Orangemen and four
accordion bands marched from their annual church service straight
up to barbed wire, cement blocks and a 15-foot-high (5 meter) iron
wall blocking their intended parade route down the predominantly
Catholic Garvaghy Road.
	   ``I can assure her majesty's government that we will be staying
here until such time as we are allowed our legitimate right to walk
the road,'' said Portadown's senior Orangeman, Harold Gracey.
	   Police chief Ronnie Flanagan insisted, however, that he would
enforce a decision by the government-appointed Parades Commission
barring the Orange parade from the Garvaghy Road, where militant
Catholics have organization opposition to the march for the past
three summers.
	   And trenches and four rows of barbed-wire coils, erected
Saturday by British army engineers, turned the pasture flanking
Drumcree Anglican church _ the focal point for the Orangemen's
annual parade _ into a no man's land.
	   Beyond those defenses, riot police in helmets and
flame-retardent jumpsuits kept watch lest any Protestants try to
breach the barricade and head for the nearby Garvaghy Road. Army
spotter planes and helicopters hovered overhead.
	   Such showdowns have plunged Northern Ireland into sectarian
chaos the past two summers, and disagreement over this year's march
has already encouraged a round of arson attacks on Catholic
churches and halls belonging to the Orange Order, Northern
Ireland's largest fraternal organization.
	   While such violence can't unravel April's multiparty peace
agreement, it tests its basic assumption _ that Catholic and
Protestant politicians will be able, for the first time in history,
to govern this divided land together.
	   David Trimble, Protestant first minister of the new government,
is an Orangeman and defends their right to march. His moderate
Catholic deputy, Seamus Mallon, wants the Orangemen to avoid
antagonizing Catholics.
	   Orange leaders emphasized Sunday that they would not negotiate
with the Catholic protesters, that fundamental principles were at
stake, and that they expected to win this year's confrontation.
	   Underlining their plans for a long standoff, some marchers
brought backpacks with sleeping bags, rain gear and food and
erected tents in the fields around Drumcree. Many more members of
the 80,000-strong organization were expected to travel to Drumcree
to provide back-up.
	   ``This will be a battle of wills to see who gives in first,''
said Joel Patton, leader of a hard-line Orange faction called
Spirit of Drumcree, which opposes any negotiations with Catholic
protesters.
	   ``Our enemies know that if we lose the right to march on
Garvaghy Road, every Orange march will be in jeopardy. We will
disappear into oblivion,'' said Patton, who wore a ``1995 Siege of
Drumcree'' medal commemorating the first of three standoffs here
that ended in the Orangemen's favor and infuriated Catholics.
	   Orangemen insist that their marches _ with drum-thumping bands
and banners proclaiming allegiance to queen and country _ should
offend nobody. But many Catholics consider them deliberately
provocative and designed to make them feel like second-class
citizens.
	   Protests led by IRA supporters began in 1995 to challenge a few
dozen annual Orange marches that pass near or through Catholic
turf. But no dispute so stirs up the Orangemen as the fight over
Garvaghy Road, since Portadown is the birthplace of the
203-year-old group.
	   In Garvaghy Road, Catholic protest leader Breandan MacCionnaith
said his community remained deeply suspicious that authorities
would relent to Orange pressure. ``How can you trust people who
beat you into the ground?'' he said of the predominantly Protestant
police force.
	   Orangemen have refused to negotiate directly wit MacCionnaith, a
former Irish Republican Army prisoner.
	   In 1996, when police last blocked the march, Orangemen massed in
their tens of thousands at Drumcree, blocking roads across Northern
Ireland, and Protestants rioted for four nights before police caved
in and cleared Catholic protesters off Garvaghy Road for the
parade.
	   Last year, fearing more Protestant rioting, the security forces
cleared Garvaghy Road so the parade could pass, sparking four
nights of Catholic disturbances.

Atherton and Stewart hold up South Africa
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with tea score
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ England captains past and present _
Mike Atherton and Alec Stewart _ hit half centuries to temporarily
halt South Africa's push for victory in the third cricket test at
Old Trafford Sunday.
	   At tea on day four, the pair had already scored two-thirds of
England's total runs.
	   Faced with the task of saving the match after England was forced
to follow-on, Atherton and Stewart combined for a century stand to
steer their side to 152 for two with four sessions to play.
	   Atherton, with a patiently compiled 67, and Stewart, a forceful
75, added 141 for the third wicket to keep England's hopes afloat
to save the test.
	   Stewart took the attack to South Africa's bowlers, racing to his
second half century of the series with nine boundaries.
	   Atherton played a near 11-hour innings two years ago in
Johannesburg to save a test against South Africa and has so far
batted for 207 minutes hitting just 10 boundaries.
	   England was dismissed for 183 in its first innings and was in
trouble shortly after starting its second, still 369 runs behind
South Africa's first innings total.
	   The home team lost opener Nick Knight and Nasser Hussain with
just 11 runs on the board.
	   But the experienced third wicket pair overcame a nervous start
against a rampant Allan Donald.
	   England, still smarting from a 10-wicket thrashing in the second
test at Lord's, is still 217 runs adrift from avoiding an innings
defeat.
	   Jacques Kallis looked the most dangerous of the South African
bowlers with his exaggerated swing bowling beating the bat
repeatedly but without luck.
	   Donald bowled with disconcerting bounce and pace to remove
Knight for the second time this match in his third over, but like
Kallis, failed to find the edge in the post-lunch session.
	   The Stewart-Atherton partnership has provided one of England's
brightest batting efforts since the first test in Edgbaston, as the
team went through an entire session without losing a wicket.
	   England scored 121 runs in between lunch and tea at a rate
faster than a run each minute.
	   Resuming the day on 162 for eight, the England first innings
lasted just 26 minutes as Paul Adams and Kallis combined to remove
Darren Gough and No.11 Angus Fraser. England was automatically sent
back into bat.
	   Earlier, veteran South African opener Gary Kirsten hit a
career-best 210 as South Africa declared its first innings on 552
for five after 13 tedious hours of batting.

Sampras goes for 5th Wimbledon title; Ivanisevic after first

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Pete Sampras went after his fifth
Wimbledon crown Sunday, trying to match the modern mark set by
Bjorn Borg and draw ever closer to the record for most Grand Slam
titles.
	   Goran Ivanisevic, however, was not making things easy as Sampras
pursued his bid for history at the All England Club.
	   The Centre Court match between two of the biggest hitters in
tennis was even after two sets, with each set going to a
tiebreaker.
	   Sampras, the defending champion and top seed, won the third set
6-4 after taking the second 7-6 (11-9). Ivanisevic, the No. 14 seed
going for his first Grand Slam title, won the first set 7-6 (7-2).
This was his third appearance in a Wimbledon final.
	   Sampras and Ivanisevic met in the 1994 final with Sampras
winning in three sets, including 6-0 in the third. Ivanisevic also
lost in the '92 final to Andre Agassi.
	   A win would give Sampras 11 Grand Slam titles, tying him with
Borg and Rod Laver for second place on the all-time list. Roy
Emerson holds the men's record with 12 titles.
	   Sampras had failed to reach the semifinals in the past three
majors. This year, Sampras' results have been so far below par that
with a loss Sunday he drops to No. 2 in the rankings behind Marcelo
Rios of Chile.
	   After rallying to win the second set, Sampras make his move in
the fifth game of the third set when he broke Ivanisevic to lead
3-2, hitting a backhand service winner on the third break point of
the game.
	   Sampras, steadying his serve _ which had wobbled in the first
two sets _ served out the set as Ivanisevic began to show a bit of
his famous temper, tossing his racket to the ground on a missed
shot in the decisive 10th game.
	   Sampras put the second set away with the tiebreaker at 9-9.
Ivanisevic, serving, hit a forehand volley at the net long, and
then Sampras _ taking the serve _ hit a service winner to
Ivanisevic's forehand.
	   To open the second set, Sampras held serve and broke Ivanisevic
in the second game _ the first break of the match as Ivanisevic
doubled faulted twice to go down 15-40. He saved the first break
but Sampras broke on a backhand volley winner.
	   Ivanisevic broke right back in the third game. Sampras, down
15-40, saved two break points. On the third break point, Ivanisevic
missed a backhand passing shot and slammed his racket on the court
_ breaking it.
	   He played out the next point and won it, then changed rackets to
avoid a warning for racket abuse. He then won on the fourth break
point with a forehand passing shot.
	   Ivanisevic held serve in the fourth to put the match back on
serve. It stayed that way through the 12th at 6-6 with little
separating the two players as they both began to serve
consistently. Ivanisevic won more from the baseline and Sampras got
more points at the net.
	   In the first set, Ivanisevic, struggled with his serve but still
held on with 13 aces to none for Sampras. Ivanisevic also double
faulted nine times in the first set and saved six break points.
	   Sampras and Ivanisevic held their first two service games,
although the Croatian struggled. In the first game, Ivanisevic
served two double faults and still won. In the third, he double
faulted twice and faced four break points and survived.
	   They held their next two service games to go 4-4. In the ninth
the erratic Ivanisevic saved one break point, doubled faulted four
times and still took the game to lead 5-4. Sampras, holding his
serve more easily, won the 10th to even the set.
	   Ivanisevic saved another break point in the 11th game and hit
two mores aces, with Sampras holding easily in the 12th game.
	   Ivanisevic showed he had more than just a serve, hitting a
backhand winner down the baseline and a forehand cross-court winner
to go up 5-2 in the tiebreaker as he then served out to win 7-2.
	   Sampras is 4-0 in Wimbledon finals and 26-1 on Centre Court,
with the only loss in the 1996 quarterfinals to eventual champion
Richard Krajicek. Sampras is also 10-2 in Grand Slam finals.
	   Ivanisevic, who has slumped to a No. 25 ranking after being a
top-five player, celebrated Croatia's 3-0 semifinal World Cup upset
over Germany on Friday.
	   The 6-foot-4 left-hander trails the series with Sampras 10-6 and
had won only one of the last eight matches. They've played twice at
Wimbledon _ Sampras won in straight sets in the '94 final and won
in five sets in the 1995 semifinals.

German radical rightist party to run in all states in federal
</HEADLINE>
elections &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ A radical rightist party that won nearly
13 percent of the vote in a state election in April, said Monday it
was running in all 16 German states for federal parliament
elections on Sept. 27.
	   In a statement issued in Munich, the German Peoples' Union (DVU)
said its top candidate in North-Rhine Westphalia state for federal
elections will be Gerhard Frey, the chairman of the party and
publisher of right wing newspaper.
	   Franz Schoenhuber, a former chairman of the rightist
Republicaner party, will be the DVU's top candidate in federal
elections for Bavaria state, the party said.
	   The names of top candidates for the other 14 states were not
included in the statement.
	   The DVU won a surprise 12.9 percent of the vote in the eastern
state of Saxony Anhalt in April to gain 16 seats in the local
legislature. However, latest polls show they would get about three
percent of the vote in the federal runoff, less than the five
percent needed to win mandates.

Tel Aviv mayor: Israel in danger of becoming another Iran
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Israel is in danger of becoming another
Iran, the mayor of Tel Aviv warned Sunday at the launching of an
organization to battle religious coercion.
	   The new group, called the Public Committee in Support of Freedom
of Religion in Israel, will be co-chaired by Roni Milo, Tel Aviv's
secular mayor, and Avraham Burg, chairman of Israel's Jewish Agency
and an observant Jew.
	   At a press conference in Tel Aviv, Milo called for putting a
check on the power of the nation's ultra-religious minority.
	   ``Today we see women broadcasters on Iranian television with
veils covering their faces,'' Milo said. ``I don't exclude the
possibility that we will see women broadcasters on Israeli
television wearing long sleeves because to do otherwise offends
offends the feelings of the ultra-religious public who dictate in
Israel today what will happen in the future.''
	   The organization will work to gain public support for the
passage of so-called ``freedom of religion'' legislation that calls
for greater separation of religion and state.
	   Friction between the country's ultra-religious minority and its
secular majority has increased in recent months.
	   Milo, who has positioned himself as a leading voice against
religious coercion, recently formed a liberal centrist party and
announced plans to run for prime minister in elections scheduled
for 2000.

World Cup: Germans glance at bleak future after loss to Croatia

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Dejected Germans pondered their national
soccer team's cloudy future Sunday after the stunning 3-0 loss to
newcomer Croatia ousted the former champions from the World Cup.
	   It was one of the biggest upsets in history of the tournament,
and it left many German fans in a state of shock and tears. Germany
won the World Cup in 1950, 1974 and 1990, but has now been ousted
in the quarterfinals of two straight World Cups.
	   In a sign that the team's legendary cohesiveness took a beating,
the German Soccer Federation said players would not return home as
a group, but split up for vacations or individual travel back.
	   More than three-fourths of the country's TV viewing audience
watched the match Saturday night from Lyon, France.
	   While most Germans took the loss stoically, one fan in Augsburg
lost control.
	   Police said the 26-year-old man who had been drinking with
friends during the TV broadcast leaped out a first-floor window and
broke his jaw. His name wasn't released.
	   In Hamburg and dozens of other communities, the Lutheran Church
organized a program called ``France 98 _ The Soccer Party in
Church,'' with large screens for fans to see the World Cup games
together.
	   About 120 fans at Hamburg's St. Elizabeth church were still
singing ``We are the Champions,'' as the Croatia-German game got
started.
	   ``After Croatia scored the first goal they were still optimistic
and enjoying sausages and beer. After their second goal things got
quiet, and when the third went in the tears started to flow,'' said
Rainer Chinnow, the pastor.
	   At the final whistle, Chinnow and his assistant, Joern de Jager,
had their work cut out for them. ``It wasn't easy to find consoling
words,'' the pastor said, of counseling that lasted into the early
hours of Sunday.
	   His sermon for Sunday was ``about the lost son and how one deals
with defeat,'' Chinnow said.
	   In Berlin, Frankfurt, Cologne and dozens of other cities, Croat
fans staged impromptu parades in cars with honking horns, waving
flags out the windows.
	   TV clips showed Croats and Germans celebrating together as if
all were forgiven between the traditional allies. Thousands of
Croatians found refuge in Germany during the war with Serbia.
	   Police said that except for a couple of scuffles between fans in
Cologne, there was no serious trouble reported.
	   Commenting on the game, Bild am Sonntag newspaper said the
Germans gave their best, but it wasn't enough from an aging cadre _
the 22-member squad averages just under 30.
	   Coach Berti Vogts said he expects six to eight veterans,
including Juergen Klinsmann, Lothar Matthaeus, and Juergen Kohler,
to leave the team, and the future is bleak with little fresh talent
in sight.
	   Bild noted that England _ ousted in the second round by
Argentina _ has a bright future with players like 18-year-old
Michael Owen, and Gary Neville, Sol Campbell, Paul Scholes and
David Beckman, all 23. Germany's only young player is Jens
Jeremies, age 24.
	   Chancellor Helmut Kohl, smiling broadly in one TV interview from
Lyon after the game, appeared to stress German-Croatian friendship.
``We lost. We are all sad,'' he said with a shrug.
	   Croatia fought on the side of Nazi Germany in World War II, and
the German government was Croatia's strongest supporter for
independence when war broke out in Yugoslavia in 1992.

World Cup: Argentina leaves without having reached its goal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VICENTE LEONARDO PANETTA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ The quarterfinals are not good enough
for Argentina.
	   The South American team left the World Cup with a bitter taste
after failing to reach at least the semifinals, the goal it had set
for itself before the tournament.
	   Eliminated by the Netherlands on Saturday in a 2-1 quarterfinals
loss, Argentina had the additional indignity of not being able to
beat a team despite having a man advantage late in the match.
	   ``We are heartbroken,'' goalkeeper Carlos Roa said. ``We have to
go back much sooner than we had anticipated.''
	   Argentina had a man advantage for 15 minutes following Dutch
defender Arthur Numan's accumulation of a second yellow card. But
the Argentines gave away the bonus when midfielder Ariel Ortega was
ejected with two minutes remaining.
	   In the final minute, Dennis Bergkamp delivered the final blow
with one of the most picturesque goals of the tournament.
	   Coach Daniel Passarella blamed the defeat on an ``unfortunate
play'', referring to the sequence that resulted in Ortega's
ejection.
	   With the game winding down, Ortega collided with Dutch defender
Jaap Stam and fell in the penalty area. Ortega and the other
Argentine players protested for a penalty, but Mexican referee
Arturo Brizio signaled for play to continue.
	   Dutch goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar ran over to Ortega,
confronting him about his actions. As Ortega got up, he headbutted
Van der Sar, drawing a red card from Brizio.
	   The result was no penalty kick, and play restored to 10-on-10.
Argentina was still recovering from Ortega's expulsion when
Bergkamp latched on to a ball from Frank de Boer and exhibited one
of the best individual displays of the tournament to send the
Netherlands to the semifinals and eliminate Argentina.
	   ``We lost against a great team, in a vibrant, emotion-packed
game. I have no regrets,'' Passarella stated.
	   Passarella himself, however, had said that if the team didn't
reach the semifinals, it would have failed.
	   And the players faces after the game made clear that the team
had fallen short of its goal, especially after being picked by many
to win it all.
	   Argentina was one of only two teams that won all its first round
games _ the other being host France.
	   It beat Japan and Croatia 1-0, and Jamaica 5-0. In the second
round, however, Argentina's offense sputtered, unable to finish off
an England team that played for more than 70 minutes one man short.
	   The game ended in a 2-2 draw, and Argentina advanced on penalty
kicks, after his goalkeeper Carlos Roa blocked two of England's
attempts.
	   Against the Netherlands, Argentina showed once again an
excessive dependence on Ortega, a player with a huge talent,
capable of eluding the best defender, but too selfish and with
little tactical discipline.
	   To some, Ortega was a genius; to others, he was a liability. He
made some of the most stunning moves of the tournament, but rarely
finished his plays on a positive note. Most of the time he tried
one dribble too many or kept the ball too long and had the ball
tackled away.
	   At no time did he manage to forge a partnership with striker
Gabriel Batistuta, who left the tournament sharing the scoring lead
with five goals.
	   Most critics contend that Passarella's biggest failure was not
being able to accommodate Batistuta, a player he has grudgingly
accepted and placed on the roster due to popular demand.
	   Diego Maradona said Argentina lost because ``it didn't do what
does best: attack.''
	   Passarella's critics agree. They say he adopted tactics that
were too cautious and didn't take advantage of the natural talent
of Argentine players.
	   It's a criticism Passarella won't have to hear any longer.
Passarella's contract expires with the end of the World Cup and he
has said he does not plan to return.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Forest fires raged through the
Mediterranean island of Cyprus on Sunday, while fire fighters in
Greece and Italy controlled most of the raging blazes that have
killed one person and destroyed thousands of acres (hectares) of
forest.
	   Fires ravaged through Cyprus, where some 5,000 acres (hectares)
of forest land were reportedly burning.
	   The inhabitants of three villages were evacuated in the
Turkish-occupied northern third of the island, the Turkish Cypriot
news agency, TAK, reported.
	   Helicopters sent from Turkey were helping local fire fighters
push back the flames that had swept through parts of the rest of
Cyprus and the U.N. buffer zone.
	   Turkish and Greek communities have been divided since 1974, when
Turkish troops invaded the island.
	   At least five people were reported injured.
	   In Greece, fire fighters had reined in most of the 180 fires
that swept across the country Saturday.
	   Less than 10 fires were still out of control, including one
forest fire on Mount Parnes about 20 kilometers (13 miles) north of
Athens.
	   Government officials said they would investigate whether the
fires were deliberately set. After an emergency meeting Sunday, two
cabinet members said it was suspicious that 120 blazes broke out
within an hour.
	   Hot, dry winds and high temperatures spurred the outbreak and
had grounded fire-fighting planes Saturday. But the winds subsided
Sunday.
	   Officials were still trying to evaluate the scope of the damage.
	   One woman died on the island of Salamina west of Athens while
trying to escape her burning home.
	   At least eight people were taken to hospitals suffering from
smoke inhalation. Preliminary estimates showed 40 houses damaged or
destroyed and several thousand acres (hectares) of forest and
woodland reduced to ash.
	   More than 1,000 soldiers joined about 5,000 firefighters using
planes and helicopters in an effort to rein in the blazes.
	   Political fallout continued Sunday as municipalities and
opposition leaders accused the government of poor coordination in
fighting the blazes.
	   Firefighters couldn't reach all the fires, and in several
places, residents tried to put out flames with branches, rocks and
blankets.
	   In Italy, cooler temperatures eased the threat from fires in the
southern regions of Calabria and Puglia and in Sicily, but
scattered blazes continued to burn.
	   Fire-fighting helicopters and planes were called in to at least
15 places, authorities said. Most of their targets were around
Siracusa in Sicily and Reggio Calabria, on the tip of the mainland.

Indian army kills seven insurgents in Kashmir
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ Indian security forces killed five
insurgents on the disputed border with Pakistan and killed two more
fighters in a lengthy gunbattle in the troubled northern state of
Kashmir, the military said Sunday.
	   The five militants were killed as they tried to cross from
Pakistan to India through the Himalayan pass of Tutmari Gali, about
100 kilometers (60 miles) northwest of Jammu-Kashmir state's
capital Srinagar, army spokesman Brigadier Arun Chopra told The
Associated Press.
	   Two more insurgents were killed late Saturday at Kupwara, 200
kilometers (120 miles) northwest of Srinagar on the third day of a
gunbattle with the army. Nine militants were killed Friday in that
battle, Chopra said.
	   India has not reported any Indian casualties in the battle.
	   That battle started Thursday when India's army challenged a
large group of insurgents.
	   The Himalayan territory of Kashmir is divided between India and
Pakistan. Both countries lay claim to the whole territory.
	   New Delhi accuses officially Islamic Pakistan of backing a
9-year-old insurgency in India's section of Kashmir, the only
Muslim majority state in predominantly Hindu India. Pakistan denies
it, saying it lends only moral support to the militants.

Saudi prince sets up bank for the poor in Egypt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A Saudi prince and an Egyptian bank on
Sunday established a bank that will give loans to the poor to open
businesses, a charity group said.
	   The Bank of the Poor, which was the idea of Saudi Prince Talal
bin Abdul-Aziz, will have a capital of 200 million pounds (dlrs
58.8 million), the Arab Council for Childhood and Development said.
	   ``A large number of people will benefit from this project,
especially those of low income,'' the council said in a statement.
	   The establishment of the bank was spearheaded by Prince Talal
and the National Bank of Egypt.
	   Fifty million pounds (dlrs 14.7 million) of the capital will be
offered to the public for subscription, the statement said.
	   The statement said that the prince is willing to consider
opening a similar bank in Lebanon.

Sampras goes for 5th Wimbledon title; Ivanisevic after first

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Pete Sampras went after his fifth
Wimbledon crown Sunday, trying to match the modern mark set by
Bjorn Borg and draw ever closer to the record for most Grand Slam
titles.
	   Goran Ivanisevic, however, was not making things easy as Sampras
pursued his bid for history at the All England Club.
	   The Centre Court match between two of the biggest hitters in
tennis was even after four sets with two set going to tiebreakers.
	   Ivanisevic won the fourth set 6-3 to level at two each. Sampras,
the defending champion and top seed, won the third set 6-4 after
taking the second 7-6 (11-9).
	   Ivanisevic, the No. 14 seed going for his first Grand Slam
title, won the first set 7-6 (7-2). This was his third appearance
in a Wimbledon final.
	   Sampras and Ivanisevic met in the 1994 final with Sampras
winning in three sets, including 6-0 in the third. Ivanisevic also
lost in the '92 final to Andre Agassi.
	   A win would give Sampras 11 Grand Slam titles, tying him with
Borg and Rod Laver for second place on the all-time list. Roy
Emerson holds the men's record with 12 titles.
	   Sampras had failed to reach the semifinals in the past three
majors. This year, Sampras' results have been so far below par that
with a loss Sunday he drops to No. 2 in the rankings behind Marcelo
Rios of Chile.
	   After falling behing by a set, Ivanisevic won the fourth as he
broke Sampras in the sixth game. Up by two break points, Ivanisevic
hit a forehand cross-court winner to go up 4-2. He held his serve
to lead 5-2 and eventually served out 6-3.
	   After four sets, Ivanisevic had 30 aces to nine for Sampras.
	   After rallying to win the second set, Sampras made a move in the
fifth game of the third set when he broke Ivanisevic to lead 3-2,
hitting a backhand service winner on the third break point of the
game.
	   Sampras, steadying his serve _ which had wobbled in the first
two sets _ served out the set as Ivanisevic began to show a bit of
his famous temper, tossing his racket to the ground on a missed
shot in the decisive 10th game.
	   Sampras put the second set away with the tiebreaker at 9-9.
Ivanisevic, serving, hit a forehand volley at the net long, and
then Sampras _ taking the serve _ hit a service winner to
Ivanisevic's forehand.
	   To open the second set, Sampras held serve and broke Ivanisevic
in the second game _ the first break of the match as Ivanisevic
doubled faulted twice to go down 15-40. He saved the first break
but Sampras broke on a backhand volley winner.
	   Ivanisevic broke right back in the third game. Sampras, down
15-40, saved two break points. On the third break point, Ivanisevic
missed a backhand passing shot and slammed his racket on the court
_ breaking it.
	   He played out the next point and won it, then changed rackets to
avoid a warning for racket abuse. He then won on the fourth break
point with a forehand passing shot.
	   Ivanisevic held serve in the fourth to put the match back on
serve. It stayed that way through the 12th at 6-6 with little
separating the two players as they both began to serve
consistently. Ivanisevic won more from the baseline and Sampras got
more points at the net.
	   In the first set, Ivanisevic, struggled with his serve but still
held on with 13 aces to none for Sampras. Ivanisevic also double
faulted nine times in the first set and saved six break points.
	   Sampras and Ivanisevic held their first two service games,
although the Croatian struggled. In the first game, Ivanisevic
served two double faults and still won. In the third, he double
faulted twice and faced four break points and survived.
	   They held their next two service games to go 4-4. In the ninth
the erratic Ivanisevic saved one break point, doubled faulted four
times and still took the game to lead 5-4. Sampras, holding his
serve more easily, won the 10th to even the set.
	   Ivanisevic saved another break point in the 11th game and hit
two mores aces, with Sampras holding easily in the 12th game.
	   Ivanisevic showed he had more than just a serve, hitting a
backhand winner down the baseline and a forehand cross-court winner
to go up 5-2 in the tiebreaker as he then served out to win 7-2.
	   Sampras is 4-0 in Wimbledon finals and 26-1 on Centre Court,
with the only loss in the 1996 quarterfinals to eventual champion
Richard Krajicek. Sampras is also 10-2 in Grand Slam finals.
	   Ivanisevic, who has slumped to a No. 25 ranking after being a
top-five player, celebrated Croatia's 3-0 semifinal World Cup upset
over Germany on Friday.
	   The 6-foot-4 left-hander trails the series with Sampras 10-6 and
had won only one of the last eight matches. They've played twice at
Wimbledon _ Sampras won in straight sets in the '94 final and won
in five sets in the 1995 semifinals.

World Cup: Bogarde, Numan, Cafu miss semifinal game
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES with Sunday's developments; STANDS as
roundup. &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Dutch defender Winston Bogarde is out the World Cup
semifinals with a broken leg while co-defender Arthur Numan and
Brazil's Cafu will miss the confrontation through suspension.
	   The day after the Dutch ousted Argentina, Bogarde broke a bone
in his right lower leg in a training session Sunday when he fell
while trying to beat teammate Boudewijn Zenden.
	   ``It is a terrible disappointment for him personally and for the
team after the euphoria of yesterday,'' said Dutch coach Guus
Hiddink, whose team meets Brazil in Marseille on Tuesday while host
France faces debutante Croatia on Wednesday at the Stade de France.
	   Bogarde's injury puts severe pressure on the Dutch defense,
especially since they already knew Numan would be out. Numan was
expelled in the 2-1 quarterfinal victory against Argentina for his
second yellow card of the game.
	   Cafu received his second yellow card since the start of the
second round during Brazil's quarterfinal against Denmark for
time-wasting. His first was against Chile a week earlier.
	   Whichever team gets through the semifinal, it will get back the
services of their suspended player, who will be available for the
final.
	   ``As a child I always remember Brazil as a very good team. In
every spot on the field, the 10 players were always artistic
players,'' Hiddink said.
	   But he lamented their change to a slightly more defensive style.
	   ``They have changed their philosophy,'' he said. ``For me as a
lover of football it is a pity, but they get results.''
	   Likewise, Brazilian coach Mario Zagallo has a lot of respect for
the Dutch, and even picked the Netherlands as a candidate to win it
all.
	   ``They have a refined ball touch and great individual talent,''
he said. He recalled how the most entertaining Dutch team even
reached the final four years after the brilliant Brazilians won the
the title in 1970.
	   ``In 1970, we played beautiful football,'' Zagallo said. ``In
1974, it was exactly the same with the Dutch.''
	   Brazil, the defending champion and the most successful World Cup
team of all time, aims to hold on to the trophy, while the other
three semifinalists, Netherlands, France and Croatia, have never
won it before.
	   In Croatia's case, it has advanced all the way to the final four
in its first appearance at the World Cup. After upsetting
three-time winner Germany in the quarterfinals, the team is aiming
to beat host France and make it all the way to the final.
	   ``It's only a half surprise for me,'' French coach Aime Jacquet
said after Croatia's stunning quarterfinal upset of the Germans on
Saturday. ``Beating Germany 3-0 needs no further comment.
	   ``We have to watch out,'' Jacquet said. ``It's a new nation, a
new flag and Croatia is very dangerous.''
	   The four semifinalists shape up this way:
 &UR; Brazil &QC; 
	   Four Brazilians have their own goalscoring race going on with
Rivaldo, Bebeto, Ronaldo and Cesar Sampaio all with three goals.
	   But a weak defense was repeatedly exploited by Denmark's fast
forwards, and the Dutch, who also have talented strikers like
Dennis Bergkamp, Patrick Kluivert and Marc Overmars, will relish
the opportunity of attacking Junior Baiano and Aldair at the heart
of the Brazilian defense.
 &UR; Netherlands &QC; 
	   The Arsenal attacking duo of Bergkamp and Overmars have been
embarrassing defenders throughout the World Cup, and Bergkamp's
last-minute goal to oust Argentina in the quarterfinals is one of
the highlights of the championship.
	   But Jaap Stam, hailed as the world's most expensive defender
after his 10-million-pound (dlrs 16.7-million) transfer from PSV
Eindhoven to Manchester United, has been guilty of errors that gave
away goals.
 &UR; France &QC; 
	   After scoring nine goals in three first-round group games, the
French forwards have lost sight of the net.
	   Although midfield stars such as Zinedine Zidane, Youri Djorkaeff
and Emmanuel Petit have supplied plenty of ammunition, the strikers
couldn't score against either Paraguay or Italy and the lone French
goal in those games came from central defender Laurent Blanc.
	   At the least the defense, with Blanc and Marcel Desailly looking
consistent, have only yielded one goal in five games.
 &UR; Croatia &QC; 
	   The complete outsider left in the competition upset three-time
champion Germany 3-0 in the quarterfinal.
	   Robert Jarni, Goran Vlaovic and Davor Suker scored after the
Germans had a player sent off. But the Croatians have stars from
big Italian and Spanish clubs who are battle-tested at the highest
club level and won't feel overmatched, even against the home team.

	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ Indian security forces killed five
insurgents on the disputed border with Pakistan and killed two more
fighters in a lengthy gunbattle in the troubled northern state of
Kashmir, the military said Sunday.
	   The five militants were killed Sunday as they tried to cross
from Pakistan to India through the Himalayan pass of Tutmari Gali,
about 100 kilometers (60 miles) northwest of Jammu-Kashmir state's
capital Srinagar, army spokesman Brigadier Arun Chopra told The
Associated Press.
	   Two other insurgents were killed late Saturday at Kupwara, 200
kilometers (120 miles) northwest of Srinagar on the third day of a
gunbattle with the army. Nine militants were killed Friday in that
battle, Chopra said.

	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Pete Sampras beat Goran Ivanisevic in
five sets Sunday to win his fifth Wimbledon title and 11th Grand
Slam championship.
	   Sampras, converting a few key returns to break the Croatian's
big serve, won the tournament for the fifth time in six years with
a 6-7 (7-2), 7-6 (11-9), 6-4, 3-6, 6-2 triumph.
	   When Ivanisevic sailed a backhand long on the first match point,
Sampras responded in relatively subdued fashion, holding up his
arms and flashing a big smile.

	   The victory tied Sampras with Bjorn Borg for the most Wimbledon
singles titles of the Open era. Borg won five straight from
1976-80.
	   Sampras also moved into a second-place tie with Borg and Rod

the record of 12 held by Roy Emerson.
	   By reasserting his grass-court superiority, and extending his
Wimbledon record to 44-2 since 1992, Sampras ended a year-long
slump in which he failed to get past the quarterfinals of the last
three Grand Slam events.
	   For Ivanisevic, it marked his third defeat in a Wimbledon final.
He lost to Andre Agassi in 1992 and Sampras in 1994.

Tel Aviv mayor: Israel in danger of becoming another Iran
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Israel is in danger of becoming another
Iran, the mayor of Tel Aviv warned Sunday at the launching of an
organization to battle religious coercion.
	   The new group, called the Public Committee in Support of Freedom
of Religion in Israel, will be co-chaired by Roni Milo, Tel Aviv's
secular mayor, and Avraham Burg, an observant Jew who is chairman
of Israel's Jewish Agency.
	   At a news conference in Tel Aviv, Milo called for putting a
check on the power of Israel's ultra-religious minority.
	   ``Today we see women broadcasters on Iranian television with
veils covering their faces,'' Milo said. ``I don't exclude the
possibility that we will see women broadcasters on Israeli
television wearing long sleeves because to do otherwise offends the
feelings of the ultra-religious public who dictate in Israel today
what will happen in the future.''
	   The organization will work to gain public support for the
passage of ``freedom of religion'' legislation that calls for
greater separation of religion and state.
	   Friction between the country's ultra-religious minority and its
secular majority has increased in recent months.
	   Milo, who has positioned himself as a leading voice against
religious coercion, recently formed a liberal centrist party and
announced plans to run for prime minister in elections scheduled
for 2000.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Vandals burned down several Palestinian fruit
stalls in the West Bank city of Hebron on Sunday, and a court
extended the detention of a 19-year-old Jew suspected of
vandalizing Arab-owned cars there.
	   Israeli and Palestinian leaders, meanwhile, continued to trade
blame over last week's standoff in the Gaza Strip.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused the Palestinians of
threatening violence every time a dispute arises, which he called
``the opposite of peace and ... intolerable.''
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, returning from a summit in
Cairo on the stalled peace process, called Netanyahu's threats of
retribution ``meaningless.''
	   Netanyahu came under criticism from right-wing ministers in his
own Cabinet for backing down and allowing a Palestinian convoy to
use an Israeli-controlled road in Gaza after Israeli and
Palestinian troops confronted each other with cocked assault rifles
and armored personnel carriers. Israeli troops blocked Palestinian
traffic and Palestinian truckers blockaded Jewish settlements
during the confrontation, which began when Israeli troops stopped
the Palestinian convoy.
	   Israel Radio said Netanyahu told the Cabinet the decision to
allow the convoy to pass had been made without his knowledge, and
that he opposed the move. Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said
he gave the order to allow the convoy through, the radio said, but
added that the road is now closed to Palestinian traffic,
	   Earlier Sunday, the Magistrates Court extended the detention of
Nathaniel Nir by five days. Two other young men suspected of
involvement in the Friday night vandalism spree have yet to be
caught, Israeli police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said.
	   The three Israelis, riding horses and disguised as Arabs, are
suspected of shattering the windshields and denting cars parked
near the Jewish settlement Kiryat Arba, on the outskirts of Hebron.
	   In a separate incident, at least four Palestinian fruit stalls
were burned down early Sunday morning in Hebron. One stall owner,
Adbel Samad Abu Sneineh, said he saw four Jewish settlers running
from the scene.
	   ``This is a brutal action and I demand protection for myself and
others from these settlers,'' Abu Sneineh said.
	   Menuhin said police were investigating the incident.
	   About 500 Jewish settlers live in downtown Hebron, in the midst
of 130,000 Palestinians. Relations between the two communities are
tense and from time to time there are outbreaks of violence.
	   Most of the city is controlled by the Palestinian Authority, but
the Israeli army and police control the Jewish enclaves and Arab
neighborhoods close to them.

Algeria makes Arabic official language on independence day
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Angry Berbers remained shuttered inside
their homes to protest a law that took effect Sunday making Arabic
the only official language in Algeria.
	   The introduction of the controversial law overshadowed the 36th
anniversary of Algeria's independence from France, which was also
marked on Sunday.
	   The law bans from official use all languages except Arabic,
including French, which is widely used in this former French colony
in North Africa.
	   Berbers, who make up a third of the Algerian population, oppose
the law, which is considered by many as an attempt by the
military-backed government to win the support of Islamic movements.
	   The Algerian government has been fighting an Islamic insurgency
that broke out after the 1992 cancelation of a parliamentary vote
that Muslim parties were set to win. The conflict has left an
estimated 75,000 people dead.
	   Storekeepers shut their shops and the streets were empty in
regions populated by Berbers, who largely followed a call by the
Berber Cultural Movement to stay inside to protest the law.
	   The Berbers, are an ancient group of tribes, who have long
fought to preserve their language against government efforts to
make Arabic the only official language in Algeria.
	   Over the past 10 days, the law has provoked protests among
Berbers, who remain shocked by the murder in late June of a popular
Berber singer by Muslim activists.
	   The new law requires government offices, state and private
enterprises and political parties to use Arabic in all official
correspondence and to speak Arabic during their deliberations.
	   The law stipulates that the full introduction of Arabic in
higher education be completed by the year 2000.
	   French, English and Spanish-language radio stations, however,
can continue to broadcast as before.
	   Political parties opposed to the law want the government to give
Berber, or Tamazight as it is also known, a status equivalent to
that of Arabic and to permit French to be used at work.

Survey: Swiss support trade complaint over sanctions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: EDITS to conform with more details of poll. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ The Swiss favor diplomatic moves to
head off U.S. threats of sanctions against Swiss banks but would
back a protest to the World Trade Organization over any boycott,
according to a survey published Sunday.
	   In the poll of a representative sample of 605 men and women in
French- and German-speaking parts of Switzerland, 61 percent said
Switzerland should file a complaint with the WTO over U.S.
sanctions. Some 23 percent opposed such a move.
	   New York City and state on Thursday turned up the pressure over
deadlocked talks between Swiss commercial banks, Jewish groups and
lawyers for Holocaust survivors by announcing plans to withhold
business from the banks and, if no solution is found, from other
Swiss firms. Other states also have announced plans for sanctions.
	   Last month, the banks offered dlrs 600 million for a settlement
of claims by Holocaust survivors. Jewish leaders claimed that was
far less than the more than dlrs 1 billion the banks should be
paying.
	   Switzerland's government has said it would support Swiss firms
if they take legal steps against any sanctions.
	   ``A decision should be made soon'' on whether to go ahead with a
complaint to the WTO, Swiss President Flavio Cotti was quoted as
saying in the Zurich weekly SonntagsBlick.
	   The trade body can require member countries to honor their
commitment to global trading rules.
	   The survey, published in SonntagsBlick and the Lausanne daily Le
Matin, showed a clear majority against counter-sanctions by
Switzerland and Swiss firms.
	   Some 66 percent of those questioned were against the idea, with
25 percent in favor.
	   They favored diplomatic moves to end the crisis by 70 percent to
19 percent.
	   The poll showed only 8 percent believing the banks should raise
their settlement offer to head off sanctions. Some 59 percent said
the current offer should stand, while 23 percent said it should be
withdrawn altogether.
	   Meanwhile, 42 percent said payments from a Swiss fund to help
needy Holocaust survivors should be stopped. Fifty percent opposed
that idea.
	   No margin of error was given for the survey, carried out Friday
and Saturday by the Isopublic research institute, a member of
Gallup International.

	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Tens of thousands of Croats partied till
dawn Sunday, celebrating their World Cup triumph over mighty
Germany _ the biggest in their young nation's eight-year history.
	   People exploded with joy when the team advanced to the
semifinals Saturday by pounding three-time winner Germany 3-0. Tens
of thousands of revelers poured into the streets of the capital,
Zagreb, singing, dancing and dousing one another with champagne.
	   Banners fluttering from apartment houses in Zagreb early Sunday,
reading ``We are the champions,'' still echoed the pride.
	   Croatia has not seen such celebrations since 1991, when it
fulfilled its decades-old desire to break away from the former
Yugoslavia and become an independent country.
	   ``We are a small nation; many in the world did not even know
that we existed,'' said Ante Zupan, a 33-year-old electrician,
almost crying with joy. ``Now they'll know.''
	   President Franjo Tudjman, 76, who attended the match in Lyon,
France, said the victory ``boosts our confidence but it also raises
our reputation in the world. ... It's great to be the winner.''
	   Giving soccer giant Germany its heaviest loss in the World Cup
since 1954 was not only a huge upset, but sweet revenge for
Germany's 2-0 victory in the 1996 European Championship.
	   And while Germany has traditionally backed Croatia, as the first
country to recognize its independence in 1991 _ a move which some
say sparked the war that spread to Bosnia and ripped apart the
former Yugoslavia _ for one night, Croats forgot their gratitude.
	   ``Danke Deutschland (Thank you, Germany),'' giggled Damir Skaro,
a former boxer and a parliament deputy, playing with the popular
motto and refrain of a song made when Germany recognized Croatia.
	   ``Auf wiedersehen,'' echoed through the streets of Lyon after
the game.
	   At home, it was hard to find anyone in the country of 4.5
million who did not watch the match on TV. Bars carried the game
live on big screens and no one went to sleep. Shopkeepers closed
early because they expected no customers.
	   In Zagreb, 40 people were reported admitted to hospitals with
minor injuries. Several shops and tram windows were smashed.
	   A 24-year-old man died during the celebrations in Vukovar when
he slipped off a truck. In the divided city of Mostar in
neighboring Bosnia, a 25-year-old Muslim woman was killed and a man
was seriously wounded on the Muslim side when they were hit by
bullets fired in celebration from the Croat side, Bosnian radio
reported.
	   Croats lost a chance at a second round of victory celebrations
Sunday night, when Pete Sampras defeated Goran Ivanisevic for the
title Wimbledon tennis tournament Sunday.

	   CHIHUAHUA, Mexico (AP) _ The outcome of three northern state
elections Sunday could have a deep effect on Mexico's upcoming
presidential race, offering important tests of party strategies and
strengths.
	   Officials reported signs of a good voter turnout in the tight
races for three governors offices.
	   In the border state of Chihuahua, known for cowboys and booming
industrial plants, Mexico's ruling party is trying a new strategy
to recapture the governorship from the conservative National Action
Party and to revitalize itself after an unprecedented string of
election setbacks.
	   The Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, let party members
choose its candidate in its first open primary in the state, which
is about half the size of Spain. Previously, party leaders chose
candidates.
	   Propelled by public anger over crime in the border city of
Ciudad Juarez, the PRI candidate, Patricio Martinez, held a narrow
lead in most polls over his National Action rival, Ramon Galindo.
	   Both are businessmen and former city mayors, Martinez in
Chihuahua and Galindo in Nuevo Leon.
	   If Martinez wins, it would be the first time the PRI has
recaptured a state lost to the opposition, and its last chance
before the presidential election in 2000. PRI governorships will be
at risk in nine other states before then.
	   The PRI claimed every gubernatorial race nationwide from its
founding in 1929 until 1989. Since then it has lost races in six
states, all to National Action.
	   A PRI victory would strengthen the hand of party members who
favor a national primary to choose a presidential candidate.
President Ernesto Zedillo has said he favors such a system, but
some PRI officials remain wary.
	   A National Action victory would strengthen its momentum for the
presidential race and the gubernatorial races preceding it.
	   In the historic mining center of Zacatecas, the PRI is
struggling to escape an embarrassing loss.
	   The PRI's Jose Olvera Acevedo was tied in most polls with
Ricardo Monreal of the leftist Democratic Revolution Party.
	   Monreal was a popular PRI federal congressman until he bolted
from the party when officials passed him over for the gubernatorial
nomination.
	   His candidacy has given Democratic Revolution its strongest
chance yet in northern Mexico, where it is traditionally weak. The
party's biggest victory came last year in the Mexico City mayor's
race.
	   Polls showed the PRI with a lead in Durango state, which borders
both Zacatecas and Chihuahua. National Action and the leftist Labor
Party, which is weak elsewhere, also had significant support.
	   While scattered early returns were expected late Sunday night,
Mexico's complex vote-counting mechanism means definitive counts
were unlikely until Monday.

	   ``It's just really sweet,'' Sampras said. ``I can't believe I've
won five of these.''
	   The match was dominated by big serves and featured few extended
rallies, another example of the power tennis which has typified
Wimbledon finals in the 1990s.
	   Ivanisevic had 32 aces and Sampras had 12. But the key statistic
was Ivanisevic's 20 double faults.
	   The match turned in the sixth game of the fifth set when Sampras
broke for 4-2, ripping a backhand return at Ivanisevic's feet. The
Croatian couldn't dig the ball out, dumping a forehand volley into
the net.
	   After Sampras held for 5-2, a distraught Ivanisevic buried his
head in his towel and muttered to himself in Croatian during the
changeover. Sampras then broke him at love in the next game to end
the 2 hour, 52-minute match.
	   ``Goran played a great game to break me in the fourth set, and
the fifth set is anybody's ball game,'' Sampras said. ``It was just
a couple of points here and there. I was very nervous in the fifth
set. I was able to raise my level just a litle bit. The next thing
I knew I won the match. It was kind of a weird feeling.''

Chechen official optimistic about release of Russian envoy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A top Chechen law enforcement official expressed
optimism Sunday about the release of a Russian presidential envoy
who was kidnapped two months ago, a news agency reported.
	   Still, Kazbek Makhashev told the ITAR-Tass news agency that
investigators still don't know the whereabouts of the kidnapped
Russian, Valentin Vlasov. Makhashev said his kidnappers are
apparently a mobile and well-equipped international gang.
	   Russian Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin was quoted as saying
last week that Vlasov is ``alive and doing well,'' but it was not
clear how he knew that.
	   Since its 1994-96 war to break free of Russia, Chechnya has been
plagued by lawlessness, and especially by a wave of kidnappings
that has victimized many Russians and foreigners.
	   Two captives, Britons Camilla Carr and Jon James, apparently
marked the one-year anniversary of their capture on Saturday.
	   Russia still considers Chechnya to be one of its republics, but
Chechens insist they are independent and carry out many of the
functions of an independent state.

	   Ivanisevic won the first set with a rollercoaster serving show
that included 13 aces and nine double faults.
	   Ivanisevic saved six break points, including four double faults
in one game, while Sampras saved three.
	   The tiebreaker went Ivanisevic's way when he hit a backhand
passing shot for a mini-break and 2-0 lead and increased the lead
to 5-2 with a forehand winner. He then followed with an ace and a
service winner.
	   The first service break of the match came in the second game of
the second set when Sampras, head to head with Ivanisevic across
the net, stabbed a reflex backhand volley to go up 2-0.
	   But Ivanisevic broke right back in the next game. It took four
break points before he converted by driving a forehand pass down
the line.
	   Sampras didn't serve his first ace until the fifth game of the
second set, when he hit three in a row.
	   Only five points went against serve over the next nine games as
the two headed into another tiebreaker.
	   After double faulting on the third point to go down a
mini-break, Ivanisevic evened it up with a winning backhand return
two points later.
	   Sampras saved two set points, while serving at 5-6 and 7-8, both
times Ivanisevic failing to take advantage of second serves and
hitting high backhand returns into the net.
	   Sampras had two set points with Ivanisevic serving at 6-7 and
8-9, but the Croatian saved both with service winners.
	   The turning came on the 19th point when an Ivanisevic shot was
ruled in but was then immediately changed to out by the lineswoman.
Sampras, initially thinking he had lost the point, shouted, ``Oh,
my God,'' and held his head in his hands in disbelief.
	   But the point was replayed, and Ivanisevic sailed a sloppy
forehand volley way long to give Sampras a third set point, this
time on his own serve. He promptly hit a service winner to take the
set and even the match.
	   Sampras needed just one break in the fifth game to win the third
set.
	   Ivanisevic played a weak forehand volley into the net at deuce
to give Sampras a third break point. Sampras converted by punching
a backhand cross-court return for a winner, then pumped his right
fist and screamed, ``Yeah!''
	   The two stayed on serve the rest of the set, with Sampras
serving out at love and closing with an ace. During that game,
Ivanisevic's frustration was apparent. He tossed his racket after
one error and, after Sampras guessed right at the net to make a
reflex volley, he held out his arms as if to say, ``What can I
do?''
	   In the fourth set, Sampras earned a break point that could have
put him up 3-2 after Ivanisevic served his 17th double fault, one
point after hitting a half-volley between his legs for a winner.
Ivanisevic saved the break point with a service winner.
	   Inspired, he broke at love in the next game for a 4-2 lead with
four spectacular backcourt passing shots. On the break point, he
chased a Sampras volley way off the side of the court and slammed a
forehand cross-court winner.
	   Two games later, he served his 30th ace to close out the set and
send the match into a decisive fifth.
	   Sampras received a winner's check of dlrs 722,000, while
Ivanisevic collected dlrs 361,000.

Euro Disney and strikers' representatives meet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Euro Disney and striking workers held new talks
Sunday aimed at ending a 13-day walkout that has mainly affected
the daily parade of Disney characters.
	   About 200 workers at the vast theme park are on strike,
including parade performers, technicians and restaurant workers and
cleaners. They want a 7 percent increase in pay.
	   During Sunday's talks, Euro Disney management refused to budge
on the parade performers' demand to be considered as artists as
well as the pay increase.
	   Instead, Euro Disney offered a bonus of 400 francs (dlrs 66) for
performers who successfully auditioned for the parade, said
Giovanni Savoia, a spokesman for the strikers.
	   The strikers rejected management's offer and said they would
continue their walkout.
	   Disneyland officials have said they will not agree to a wage
hike and and that workers have received an 8 percent rise in the
past three years.
	   Euro Disney, the holding company that is 39 percent owned by the
Burbank, Calif.-based Walt Disney Co., opened the park in April
1992.
	   It has reported profits for the past three years, in part by
cutting costs that occasionally have set off labor protests.

Sampras beats Ivanisevic in five to win fifth title

	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Pete Sampras beat Goran Ivanisevic in
five sets Sunday to win his fifth Wimbledon title and 11th Grand
Slam championship.
	   Sampras, converting a few key returns to break the Croatian's
big serve, won the tournament for the fifth time in six years with
a 6-7 (7-2), 7-6 (11-9), 6-4, 3-6, 6-2 triumph.
	   When Ivanisevic sailed a backhand long on the first match point,
Sampras responded in relatively subdued fashion, holding up his
arms and flashing a big smile.
	   The victory tied Sampras with Bjorn Borg for the most Wimbledon
singles titles of the Open era. Borg won five straight from
1976-80.
	   ``It's just really sweet,'' Sampras said. ``I can't believe I've
won five of these.''
	   Sampras also moved into a second-place tie with Borg and Rod
Laver on the all-time list of Grand Slam victories, just one behind
the record of 12 held by Roy Emerson.
	   By reasserting his grass-court superiority, and extending his
Wimbledon record to 44-2 since 1992, Sampras ended a year-long
slump in which he failed to get past the quarterfinals of the last
three Grand Slam events.
	   For Ivanisevic, it marked his third defeat in a Wimbledon final.
He lost to Andre Agassi in 1992 and Sampras in 1994.
	   The match was dominated by big serves and featured few extended
rallies, another example of the power tennis which has typified
Wimbledon finals in the 1990s.
	   Ivanisevic had 32 aces and Sampras had 12. But the key statistic

	   The match turned in the sixth game of the fifth set when Sampras

Fires rage in Cyprus, under control in Greece and Italy

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Forest fires raged across the
Mediterranean island of Cyprus on Sunday, while firefighters in
Greece and Italy controlled most of the blazes that have killed one
person and destroyed thousands of acres (hectares) of forest.
	   Fires raged across Cyprus, where some 5,000 acres (2,000
hectares) of forest land were reportedly burning.
	   The inhabitants of three villages were evacuated in the
Turkish-occupied northern third of the island, according to the
Turkish Cypriot news agency, TAK.
	   At least five people were reported injured.
	   Helicopters sent from Turkey were helping local firefighters
push back the flames that had swept through parts of the rest of
Cyprus and the U.N. buffer zone.
	   Turkish and Greek communities on the island have been divided
since 1974, when Turkish troops invaded.
	   In Greece, firefighters had reined in most of the 180 fires that
swept across the country Saturday.
	   Less than 10 fires were still out of control, including one
forest fire on Mount Parnes about 20 kilometers (13 miles) north of
Athens.
	   Government officials said they would investigate whether the
fires were deliberately set. After an emergency meeting Sunday, two
cabinet members said it was suspicious that 120 blazes broke out
within an hour.
	   Hot, dry winds and high temperatures spurred the outbreak and
kept fire-fighting planes grounded Saturday. But the winds subsided
Sunday.
	   Officials were still trying to evaluate the scope of the damage.
	   One woman died on the island of Salamina west of Athens while
trying to escape her burning home.
	   At least eight people were taken to hospitals suffering from
smoke inhalation. Preliminary estimates showed 40 houses damaged or
destroyed and several thousand acres (hectares) of forest and
woodland reduced to ash.
	   More than 1,000 soldiers joined about 5,000 firefighters using
planes and helicopters in an effort to rein in the blazes.
	   Political fallout continued Sunday as municipalities and
opposition leaders accused the government of poor coordination in
fighting the blazes.
	   Firefighters couldn't reach all the fires, and in several
places, residents tried to put out flames with branches, rocks and
blankets.
	   In Italy, cooler temperatures eased the threat from fires in the
southern regions of Calabria and Puglia and in Sicily, but
scattered blazes continued to burn.
	   Fire-fighting helicopters and planes were called in to at least
15 places, authorities said.

	   PARIS (AP) _ When it comes to showing red, there's no one in
World Cup history like Arturo Brizio.
	   The Mexican referee set a Cup record for ejecting players when
he sent off Arthur Numan of the Netherlands and Ariel Ortega of
Argentina in Saturday's quarterfinal.
	   That gave him seven ejections in just six World Cup appearances,
topping the old mark of five red cards in eight games held by Joel
Quinlou of France.
	   FIFA, which released the statistic, said it was reluctant to do
so but did not see it as a slight to either Brizio or the quality
of refereeing in the tournament.
	   ``I don't think it has anything to do with the referee. He was
in the wrong place at the wrong time, or the right place at the
right time,'' spokesman Keith Cooper said. ``He was in a game that
developed to the point where he had to take that kind of action.
	   ``Are we worried (at so many red cards)? No. That's the decision
and we'll stand by that.''

	   VITTEL, France (AP) _ Several thousand locals cheered and blew
horns Sunday to welcome Croatia's soccer team back to their
training headquarters.
	   French schoolgirls held aloft a banner that said ``bravo'' and
many of the people wore the red-and-white colors of the Croatian
team to salute the players who upset Germany 3-0 Saturday to reach
the semifinal.
	   The players paraded through town in an open series of carriages
drawn by a car.
	   ``I like the Croats more because it's the Germans who got all
the attention,'' said Agnes Chretien, who works at the local
tourist office.
	   But her loyalties for the semifinal against France were clear.
	   ``I'm French. Need I say more?''
	   Dragan Juric, a Croat born close to Vittel, says he can't really
lose.
	   ``Well, if the Croats lose it means afterwards I can cheer for
France in the final,'' he said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ The semifinal field has three European teams and
one South American team for the fourth straight World Cup.
	   France, Croatia, the Netherlands and Brazil also continue a
pattern that has occurred eight times in the 16 Cups. For Brazil,
it's the ninth semifinal appearance, tying Germany's record.
	   There also have been three times when all of the final four were
from Europe, the last with Italy, Poland, West Germany and France
in 1982.
	   And the presence of the French team in the semis resumes a
string of success for the home team.
	   FIFA said the host nation has made the last four 10 times, the
only exceptions being France in 1938, Switzerland in 1954, Mexico
in 1970 and 1986, Spain in 1982 and the United States in 1994.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Downtown Kai Tak airport, famous for its
roof-skimming approaches, ended 73 years of operation Monday in an
impromptu celebration by thousands of Hong Kong residents who towed
their children and cameras along for a last, nostalgic look.
	   Fittingly, the airport's last operations were a departure for
Britain _ Hong Kong's former colonial ruler _ and an arrival from
China _ the new sovereign after Britain returned the territory last
year.
	   Hong Kong-based Dragon Air's Flight 841 from Chongqing, China,
arrived at 11:47 p.m. (1547GMT) Sunday, and passenger Tony Lee said
passengers cheered when it landed.
	   Piloted by Capt. Kim Sharman, a 21-year veteran who was retiring
after the flight, a Cathay Pacific jumbo jet left for London at two
minutes past midnight on Monday, closing Kai Tak's history.
	   Hong Kong's top civil servant, Chief Secretary Anson Chan, was
to turn out the lights at about 1 a.m. Monday (1700GMT Sunday),
officially retiring the airport.
	   Hours before the final flights, a massive operation already was
well under way to move equipment 30 kilometers (22 miles) to the
west to the new, dlrs 20 billion Chek Lap Kok airport. About 1,000
vehicles and 14 barges were being sent to the new airport, located
on an outlying island.
	   All of the equipment was to be in place for the new airport's
opening at 6:30 a.m. Monday (2230 GMT Sunday).
	   Some Hong Kong residents and frequent visitors said they planned
trips especially to use Kai Tak one last time.
	   ``This is a mess,'' 19-year-old student Jenny Chung said of Kai
Tak. ``But it is a unique mess.''
	   Chung, who was flying to Vancouver on Sunday, and her family
were among many people posing for pictures at an airport sign
outside the terminal.
	   The number of people crowding Kai Tak grew as the day went on,
and spectators were lined three and four deep around its perimeter.
Police asked them to stay away so they didn't hamper the transfer.
Authorities also blocked roads for the convoy of moving vehicles.
	   Sharman, 51, estimated he had flown into Kai Tak about 4,000
times in his career, and said the last flight would be emotional.
	   ``It's a great way to finish my career,'' he said.
	   Although workers started moving equipment Sunday morning, the
most ambitious work started in late afternoon when deck loaders and
other heavy equipment was packed. In addition to the trucks and
barges, about 30 planes were to make a 15-minute flight from the
old airport to the new one.
	   Clinton Leeks, the airport authority's corporate development
director, told Hong Kong Radio that forecasted heavy rain could
slow the move, but wouldn't stop it.
	   Hong Kong is chronically short of building space, and Kai Tak
eventually will be redeveloped for apartment buildings.
	   Construction of the massive new airport _ about the size of
London's Heathrow _ involved flattening two islets and pushing back
the sea to accommodate two runways. The airport project includes a
1,363-meter-long (4,475-foot-long) suspension bridge, an express
highway and a railway to link the airport to downtown.
	   The airport authority said the first plane to arrive at Chek Lap
Kok was an inaugural nonstop Cathay Pacific flight from New York.
	   The new airport has been marred by controversy. First announced
in 1989 to boost people's confidence amid political uncertainty and
an economic downturn, the massive project was denounced by the
Chinese, who accused the British of draining Hong Kong's coffers
before they turned the territory over to China on July 1, 1997.
	   Disputes over funding, and a delay in the completion of the
airport railway delayed the opening by about a year.
	   On Thursday, Chinese President Jiang Zemin dedicated Chek Lap
Kok airport before becoming the first passenger to leave from it.
Hours later, U.S. President Bill Clinton became the first one to
land there.

Indonesian president asks nation to fast in order to save rice
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ With millions of impoverished people
unable to afford enough food, President B.J. Habibie on Sunday
asked Indonesians to fast twice a week to save badly needed rice.
	   Habibie made the emergency appeal to Indonesia's 200 million
people in a nationally televised speech before celebrations to mark
the birthday of Islam's founder, the prophet Muhammad.
	   Indonesia faces perhaps the most critical phase of a yearlong
economic crisis in the months ahead, with aid workers warning that
tens of millions of people are sinking below the poverty line and
can't afford to eat.
	   ``I want to appeal to the people at this time of crisis. I think
we had better use the system used by many religions,'' Habibie
said, appealing to people to fast during daylight every Monday and
Thursday.
	   ``If 150 million Indonesians do this, the country can save 3
million tons of rice a year, the same amount that the country has
to import,'' he said.
	   Rice is a staple in Indonesia, where many harvests were wiped
out in 1997 and earlier this year by the worst drought in 50 years.
	   May Indonesians can't afford to buy the rice that is available.
In some areas of the country, there is not even enough rice to feed
those who can afford it.
	   Foreign governments are providing food aid to economically
stricken Indonesia, and the International Monetary Fund is leading
a dlrs 43 billion bailout for the Southeast Asian nation.
	   However, the IMF program has been held up by recent political
turmoil that led to the resignation of authoritarian President
Suharto in May.
	   Earlier Sunday, tens of thousands of Muslims gathered on the
grounds of a Jakarta sports complex for a mass prayer, many weeping
as they appealed for an end to Indonesia's economic gloom.

Sampras beats Ivanisevic in five to win fifth title

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more Sampras, Ivanisevic quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Pete Sampras beat Goran Ivanisevic in
five sets Sunday to win his fifth Wimbledon title and 11th Grand
Slam championship.
	   Sampras, converting a few key returns to break the Croatian's
big serve, won the tournament for the fifth time in six years with
a 6-7 (7-2), 7-6 (11-9), 6-4, 3-6, 6-2 triumph.
	   When Ivanisevic sailed a backhand long on the first match point,
Sampras responded in relatively subdued fashion, holding up his
arms and flashing a big smile.
	   The victory tied Sampras with Bjorn Borg for the most Wimbledon
singles titles of the Open era. Borg won five straight from
1976-80.
	   ``It's just really sweet,'' Sampras said. ``I can't believe I've
won five of these.''
	   Sampras also moved into a second-place tie with Borg and Rod
Laver on the all-time list of Grand Slam victories, just one behind
the record of 12 held by Roy Emerson.
	   By reasserting his grass-court superiority, and extending his
Wimbledon record to 44-2 since 1992, Sampras ended a year-long
slump in which he failed to get past the quarterfinals of the last
three Grand Slam events.
	   ``The year has been a little bit up and down but I know why,''
he said. ``I had a little bit of burnout. But I knew when Wimbledon
came arond, this is where it is for me and what it's all about.''
	   It was the first time Sampras had played a fifth set in a Grand
Slam final.
	   ``The fifth set is anybody's ball game,'' he said. ``It was just
a couple of points here and there. I was very nervous in the fifth
set. I was able to raise my level just a litle bit. The next thing
I knew I won the match. It was kind of a weird feeling.''
	   For Ivanisevic, it marked his third defeat in a Wimbledon final.
He lost to Andre Agassi in 1992 and Sampras in 1994.
	   ``I had a chance, this was my best chance ever here,''
Ivanisevic said. ``I thought I was going to win this match.''
	   Ivanisevic, who had won only one match in his five previous
Grand Slam events and was largely overlooked as a contender this
year, was devastated by the defeat.
	   ``I know people die, but this is the worst ever,'' he said.
``Nobody died yet. I had to get motivated to play tennis again, I
don't know how long it's going to take to get over this.''
	   Ivanisevic said he would have won the match had he taken the
second set. He blamed his fifth-set fade on the marathon 28-game
fifth set in his semifinal win over Richard Krajicek.
	   ``The Krajicek match cost me this fifth set,'' he said. ``I was
more tired than him. My legs didn't listen.''
	   The match was dominated by big serves and featured few extended
rallies, another example of the power tennis which has typified
Wimbledon finals in the 1990s.
	   Ivanisevic had 32 aces and Sampras had 12. But the key statistic
was Ivanisevic's 20 double faults.
	   The match turned in the sixth game of the fifth set when Sampras
broke for 4-2, ripping a backhand return at Ivanisevic's feet. The
Croatian couldn't dig the ball out, dumping a forehand volley into
the net.
	   After Sampras held for 5-2, a distraught Ivanisevic buried his
head in his towel and muttered to himself in Croatian during the
changeover. Sampras then broke him at love in the next game to end
the 2 hour, 52-minute match.
	   Ivanisevic said he was so drained he served ``like a woman'' in
the last game _ ``no pace, nothing there.''
	   Ivanisevic won the first set with a rollercoaster serving show
that included 13 aces and nine double faults.
	   Ivanisevic saved six break points, including four double faults
in one game, while Sampras saved three.
	   The tiebreaker went Ivanisevic's way when he hit a backhand
passing shot for a mini-break and 2-0 lead and increased the lead
to 5-2 with a forehand winner. He then followed with an ace and a
service winner.
	   The first service break of the match came in the second game of
the second set when Sampras, head to head with Ivanisevic across
the net, stabbed a reflex backhand volley to go up 2-0.
	   But Ivanisevic broke right back in the next game. It took four
break points before he converted by driving a forehand pass down
the line.
	   Sampras didn't serve his first ace until the fifth game of the
second set, when he hit three in a row.
	   Only five points went against serve over the next nine games as
the two headed into another tiebreaker.
	   Sampras saved two set points, while serving at 5-6 and 7-8, both
times Ivanisevic failing to take advantage of second serves and
hitting high backhand returns into the net.
	   ``The two set points going to my backhand I missed the balls
which is ridiculous,'' Ivanisevic said.
	   Sampras had two set points with Ivanisevic serving at 6-7 and
8-9, but the Croatian saved both with service winners.
	   The turning came on the 19th point when an Ivanisevic shot was
ruled in but was then immediately changed to out by the lineswoman.
Sampras, initially thinking he had lost the point, shouted, ``Oh,
my God,'' and held his head in his hands in disbelief.
	   But the point was replayed, and Ivanisevic sailed a sloppy
forehand volley way long to give Sampras a third set point, this
time on his own serve. He promptly hit a service winner to take the
set and even the match.
	   ``If I would go up two sets to love it would be different
story,'' Ivanisevic said. ``I don't think he would come back.''
	   Sampras needed just one break in the fifth game to win the third
set.
	   Ivanisevic played a weak forehand volley into the net at deuce
to give Sampras a third break point. Sampras converted by punching
a backhand cross-court return for a winner, then pumped his right
fist and screamed, ``Yeah!''
	   In the fourth set, Ivanisevic broke at love for a 4-2 lead with
four spectacular backcourt passing shots. On the break point, he
chased a Sampras volley way off the side of the court and slammed a
forehand cross-court winner.
	   Two games later, he served his 30th ace to close out the set and
send the match into a decisive fifth.
	   Sampras received a winner's check of dlrs 722,000, while
Ivanisevic collected dlrs 361,000.

Britons &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with Chechen president offering reward for
information about kidnapped Britons &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ One year after two British charity workers were
kidnapped in Chechnya, the republic's president offered a dlrs
100,000 reward Sunday for information about their whereabouts, a
Russian news agency reported.
	   Saturday marked the anniversary of the seizure of Camilla Carr
and Jon James, who were on a charitable mission in Chechnya with a
Quaker affiliate, The Center for Peacemaking and Community
Development.
	   The reward was announced on television by Mairbek Vachagayev, a
spokesman for Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   On Friday, relatives of the two kidnap victims met with a
representative of the British Foreign Office to demand that Britain
exert more pressure for their release. Prime Minister Tony Blair
had already written the families, saying he would do all he could.
	   Since its 1994-96 war to break free of Russia, Chechnya has been
plagued by lawlessness, and especially by a wave of kidnappings
that has victimized many Russians and foreigners.
	   A top Chechen law enforcement official expressed optimism Sunday
about the release of another prominent kidnap victim, a Russian
presidential envoy who was abducted two months ago, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported.
	   Still, Kazbek Makhashev said investigators still don't know the
whereabouts of the kidnapped Russian, Valentin Vlasov. Makhashev
said his kidnappers are apparently a mobile and well-equipped
international gang.
	   Russian Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin was quoted as saying
last week that Vlasov is ``alive and doing well,'' but it was not
clear how he knew that.
	   Russia still considers Chechnya to be one of its republics, but
Chechens insist they are independent and carry out many of the
functions of an independent state.

Survey: Swiss support trade complaint over sanctions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: EDITS to conform with more details of poll. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ The Swiss favor diplomatic moves to
head off U.S. threats of sanctions against Swiss banks but would
back a protest to the World Trade Organization over any boycott,
according to a survey published Sunday.
	   In the poll of a representative sample of 605 men and women in
French- and German-speaking parts of Switzerland, 61 percent said
Switzerland should file a complaint with the WTO over U.S.
sanctions. About 23 percent opposed such a move.
	   New York City and state on Thursday turned up the pressure over
deadlocked talks between Swiss commercial banks, Jewish groups and
lawyers for Holocaust survivors by announcing plans to withhold
business from the banks and, if no solution is found, from other
Swiss firms. Other states also have announced plans for sanctions.
	   Last month the banks offered dlrs 600 million for a settlement
of Holocaust survivors' claims. Jewish leaders claimed that was far
less than the more than dlrs 1 billion the banks should be paying.
	   Switzerland's government has said it would support Swiss firms
if they take legal steps against sanctions.
	   ``A decision should be made soon'' on whether to go ahead with a
complaint to the WTO, Swiss President Flavio Cotti was quoted as
saying in the Zurich weekly SonntagsBlick.
	   The trade body can require member countries to honor their
commitment to global trading rules.
	   The survey, published in SonntagsBlick and the Lausanne daily Le
Matin, showed a clear majority against retaliatory sanctions by
Switzerland and Swiss firms.
	   Some 66 percent of those questioned were against the idea, with
25 percent in favor.
	   No margin of error was given for the survey, carried out Friday
and Saturday by the Isopublic research institute, a member of
Gallup International.
	   Those polled favored diplomatic moves to end the crisis by 70
percent to 19 percent.
	   The poll showed only 8 percent believing the banks should raise
their settlement offer to head off sanctions. Some 59 percent said
the current offer should stand, while 23 percent said it should be
withdrawn altogether.
	   Meanwhile, 42 percent said payments from a Swiss fund to help
needy Holocaust survivors should be stopped. Fifty percent opposed
that idea.

France to produce Peugeot 205 cars in Iran
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French carmaker Peugeot announced Sunday that it
has signed an agreement with the Iran Khodro company to produce
Peugeot's 205 compact car series in Iran.
	   Starting in 1999, Iran Khodro will begin making the Peugeot 205,
one of the company's most popular models, with a goal of producing
50,000 cars annually.
	   Peugeot and the Iran Khodro also renewed a production agreement
on the larger 405 series car for 10 years. In 1998, Iran Khodro
will produce about 25,000 405s.
	   The agreements come just six weeks after the United States
agreed to waive trade sanctions against European companies that
invest in Iran. In return, the EU agreed to cooperate with efforts
to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Two calves born Sunday are the first clones from
cells from an adult cow, Japanese scientists said Sunday.
	   The so far unnamed twins were born exactly two years after
Dolly, the British sheep that made history by becoming the first
clone of an adult animal.
	   The two calves are the second adult-animal clones, and were
produced by a similar technique, said Toyokazu Morita, an official
of the Ishikawa Prefectural Livestock Research Center.
	   ``We have succeeded in producing calves from adult-animal
clones, meaning that we can produce calves exactly similar to adult
cows,'' said Morita.
	   He said the new technique would be used to breed better cattle
strains with higher-quality beef or greater milk capacity.
	   ``I think it's a very important step in the scientific
process,'' said Caird Rexroad, assistant deputy administrator for
the U.S. Department of Agriculture's research service. ``There have
been a few questions about Dolly ... and confirmation would be
good.''
	   He said the Japanese success is important primarily because it
cloned another species.
	   ``It suggests the technique may be generally usable,'' Rexroad
said.
	    &UR; On Feb. 16 ... PICKUP 6th graf pvs.

Report: Russian grain harvest expected to drop this year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's grain harvest is likely to be down this
year because less land is in production and many crops fell victim
to a spring drought, the Interfax news agency reported Sunday.
	   The agency cited Alexandra Yepikhina, a government expert on
agricultural statistics. She didn't say how much the harvest was
likely to decline, but the Agriculture Ministry previously
predicted that it would total just 70 million metric tons this
year, down 21 percent from 1997.
	   Last year, Yepikhina said, Russia imported only about 2 percent
of the grain it used. Most of the imported grain was needed for
fodder by farms in the Far East.

Wife of kidnapped American to return disappointed from Kashmir
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ Three years after her husband was
abducted by a shadowy militant group in Kashmir, Jane Schelly is
set to wind up her fourth desperate visit to the troubled state
with still no word on his fate.
	   Schelly, wife of Donald Hutchings of Spokane, Washington,
traveled Sunday to the Himalayan tourist resort of Pahalgam, near
where her husband was kidnapped in 1995. The city is 50 kilometers
(30 miles) east of Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir
state.
	   On Monday, she will fly to the Indian capital of New Delhi.
	   During the visit to Jammu-Kashmir, Schelly distributed
matchboxes with pictures of her husband and written appeals to
Kashmiris, visited a deeply revered mosque and bowed her head at a
Muslim saint's mausoleum, where all wishes are said to be granted.
	   But her prayers have gone unanswered.
	   Schelly and Hutchings were trekking in Himalayan foothills when
militants came to their camp July, 4, 1995 and abducted Hutchings.
Three years later, Hutchings wants closure.
	   ``I need to know with certainty what has become of him _ if he
is alive, where, and if he has been killed, where is his body. I
would wish to bury him with peace and dignity,'' she said in a
statement distributed to journalists in Srinagar.
	   During the visit, she met Omer Farooq, the former chief of the
Hurriyat Conference, a conglomerate of Kashmiri separatist
organizations, and visited the shrine of Pir Dastgir, a medieval
Muslim saint.
	   Hutchings as kidnapped along with five other westerners.
	   One hostage quickly escaped, but another was executed. His
beheaded body was found a month later.
	   Indian police have captured militants who have reported the
remaining hostages were killed in December 1995 or January 1996.
Searches for bodies turned up nothing.
	   A little known separatist group called Al Faran claimed
responsibility for the abductions and demanded the release of 21
guerrilla leaders in exchange for the hostages. The Indian
government refused, saying meeting the demand would encourage
kidnappings.
	   There has been no contact with Al Faran for nearly two years.

 &UR; Holbrooke returns to meet Milosevic, praises Rugova
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with U.S., Russian attempt to bolster Rugova support
 &UR; AP Photos PRI101-104, BEL103
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. and Russian envoys urged
Albanian politicians Sunday to rally behind moderate leader Ibrahim
Rugova, insisting he is the best choice to speak for Kosovo's
Albanian majority in future talks with the Yugoslav government.
	   U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister
Nikolai Afanasyevsky drove that message home during talks
throughout the day with Rugova and representatives of all 16
Albanian political parties.
	   Absent from the meetings were representatives of the militant
Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for independence from
Serbia, which along with Montenegro forms that remains of
Yugoslavia.
	   Holbrooke, who has been shuttling between Pristina and the
Yugoslav capital Belgrade since Friday, is trying to convince all
Albanian factions _ including the KLA _ to accept Rugova's
leadership.
	   The KLA has so far refused, and it was unclear whether
Holbrooke's latest effort had narrowed the differences within the
factious Albanian community.
	   ``We have continued extensive dialogue all day long with Dr.
Rugova and other political leaders,'' Holbrooke said before
returning to Belgrade. ``Dr. Rugova himself is going to continue to
seek a broader base for his goal, which is a negotiated peaceful
settlement to the Kosovo problem.''
	   Afanasyevsky also urged support for Rugova and repeated Moscow's
refusal to negotiate directly with the KLA _ which Russia and
Belgrade consider a terrorist organization.
	   Standing alongside Holbrooke and Rugova, Afanasyevsky ``we came
to Pristina today to say to Mr. Rugova and his team that we support
them as we support their peaceful platform. We think that we must
act swiftly and energetically.''
	   Referring to the KLA, Afanasyevsky said Russia sees no reason to
negotiate with those who ``kill citizens who are loyal to Serbia.''
	   The goal of U.S. and Russian mediation is to help the Albanians
overcome their differences and speak with a single voice in
negotiations with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic over the
future of the province.
	   Milosevic has expressed willingness to restore autonomy he
canceled in 1989. But Rugova and others are demanding full
independence. Nevertheless, Rugova is considered a more acceptable
negotiating partner because he opposes violence.
	   But the Serb crackdown, which has claimed hundreds of lives
since late February, has undercut Rugova's moderate appeal. The
German news magazine Spiegel quoted self-styled KLA spokesman Jakub
Krasniqi as saying his organization would never accept Rugova as a
leader because non-violence had failed to gain independence or halt
the crackdown.
	   There were no reports of fighting Sunday. But the Serb Media
Center said Albanian militants kidnapped three Serb civilians late
Saturday from villages southwest of Pristina.
	   As part of the diplomatic effort to curb the crisis,
Belgrade-based diplomats from the United States, Russia, Poland and
the European Union are to visit flashpoints in Kosovo on Monday.
	   Milosevic approved the visits last month under an agreement with
Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who was seeking to discourage NATO
military action against Serb security forces.
	   Rugova urged Kosovo Albanians to cooperate with the observer
mission.

Second sporting miracle fall short for Croatia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Croatia fell just short Sunday of pulling
off its second sporting miracle in 24 hours.
	   On the heels of its shocking 3-0 upset Saturday of Germany to
reach soccer's World Cup semifinals, Goran Ivanisevic lost a tense,
five-set match to fall to Pete Sampras in Sunday's Wimbledon final.
	   ``God could not give us both victories,'' said Livio Baric, a
construction worker. ``We made a history last night, Goran can do
it next time.''
	   But his friend Ljubo disagreed: ``Goran deserved to win
Wimbledon. We deserved the victory last night too.''
	   ``So small, but so good,'' he said of this country of 4.5
million.
	   A few disappointed cries filled the capital streets Sunday as
Ivanisevic lost in his third try at winning Wimbledon, going down
to five-time champion Sampras won won 6-7 (7-2), 7-6 (11-9), 6-4,
3-6, 6-2.
	   Otherwise, Croatia was sleepy and quiet as most people took a
rest after all-night celebrations following the soccer team's
Saturday shocker over Germany.
	   Most of the country went to bed at dawn and woke up to a rainy
afternoon to watch live TV coverage of Ivanisevic's match.
	   The streets of Zagreb were deserted during the match, unusual
for Sunday afternoons when residents like to stroll around and meet
for after-lunch coffees.
	   Television commentator, Mico Dusanovic, uttered a long unhappy
sigh when the fifth game finished. ``This was a great match. But it
will take time for all of us to get over it.''

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Downtown Kai Tak airport, famous for its
roof-skimming approaches, ended 73 years of operation Monday in an
impromptu celebration by thousands of Hong Kong residents who towed
their children and cameras along for a last, nostalgic look.
	   Fittingly, the airport's last operations were a departure for
Britain _ Hong Kong's former colonial ruler _ and an arrival from
China _ the new sovereign after Britain returned the territory last
year.
	   Hong Kong-based Dragon Air's Flight 841 from Chongqing, China,
arrived at 11:47 p.m. (1547GMT) Sunday, and passenger Tony Lee said
passengers cheered when it landed.
	   Piloted by Capt. Kim Sharman, a 21-year veteran who was retiring
after the flight, a Cathay Pacific jumbo jet left for London at two
minutes past midnight on Monday, closing Kai Tak's history.
	   A little more than an hour later, Hong Kong's top civil servant,
Chief Secretary Anson Chan, and other government officials took
part in a ceremony to shut down the runway lights, officially
retiring the airport.

Crafar wins maiden grand prix
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DONINGTON, England (AP) _ New Zealand's Simon Crafar secured his
maiden world championship race win Sunday after leading the British
Grand Prix from start to finish at Donington Park.
	   Crafar earned pole position with a lap-record 1 minute 32.661
seconds in qualifying, then beat four-time world champion Michael
Doohan by 12 seconds over the 75-mile race.
	   ``I can't believe it. I did not expect to win like this. I kept
going at 100 percent to maintain concentration. It really is great
to win,'' the Red Bull Yamaha rider said after the race.
	   Doohan, who won the British Grand Prix last year to secure his
forth successive world title, moved into second place on lap seven
of the 30-lap race but never threatened the 29-year-old New
Zealander.
	   But he took some consolation for his second place, earning
sufficient points to move into first place on the riders'
championship for the first time this season.
	   The Australian, who was aiming to make the British Grand Prix
his 50th career victory, has a seven-point lead over Italy's Max
Biaggi in the title stakes.
	   ``It seemed every time I tried to put down the power and go
faster I finished up going slower - we didn't get things together
as we should have done, but take nothing from Simon,'' Doohan said.
	   Japan's Norick Abe challenged Crafar at the start but eventually
finished in third place ahead of Alex Criville, who moved into
third in the world rankings, with Alex Barros fifth.
	   Italy's Loris Capirossi snatched a last-lap victory in the 250cc
world championship race when his Aprilia team-mate and series
leader Tetsuya Harada surprisingly slowed down after leading from
the start.
	   Former 125cc world champion Kazuto Sakata took his fourth
victory of the season to extend his lead in the 125cc championship
to 46 points over 15-year-old Marco Melandri, who finished forth.

Sampras beats Ivanisevic in five to win fifth title
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Optional lead; more Sampras quotes; edits to trim &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Pete Sampras lifted the champion's
trophy on Centre Court for the fifth time, matching Bjorn Borg's
modern record and moving within one victory of the all-time Grand
Slam mark.
	   Sampras won the tournament for the fifth time in six years
Sunday with a 6-7 (7-2), 7-6 (11-9), 6-4, 3-6, 6-2 triumph over
Goran Ivanisevic.
	   When Ivanisevic sailed a backhand long on the first match point,
Sampras responded in relatively subdued fashion, holding up his
arms and flashing a big smile.
	   The victory tied Sampras with Borg for the most Wimbledon
singles titles of the open era. Borg won five straight from
1976-80.
	   ``It's just really sweet,'' Sampras said. ``I can't believe I've
won five of these. ... It's a little overwhelming to think of
myself in those terms. I've tried to stay humble through all of my
accomplishments. I've got some years left in me where hopefully I
can do this again.''
	   Sampras also moved into a second-place tie with Borg and Rod
Laver on the all-time list of Grand Slam victories, just one behind
the record 12 held by Roy Emerson.
	   By reasserting his grass-court superiority, and extending his
Wimbledon record to 44-2 since 1992, Sampras ended a year-long
slump in which he failed to get past the quarterfinals of the last
three Grand Slam events.
	   ``The year has been a little bit up and down but I know why,''
he said. ``I had a little bit of burnout. But I knew when Wimbledon
came around, this is where it is for me and what it's all about.''
	   ``One thing that elevates my tennis is this place, the court,
the historical meaning this place has to me as a kid growing up,''
he said. ``I have no problem getting motivated for this one.''
	   It was the first time Sampras had played a fifth set in a Grand
Slam final.
	   ``It was just a couple of points here and there,'' he said. ``I
was very nervous in the fifth set. I was able to raise my level
just a litle bit. The next thing I knew I won the match. It was
kind of a weird feeling.''
	   Sampras looked in big trouble after losing the first set and
going into a tiebreaker in the second. But he saved two set points
in the 'breaker to turn the match around.
	   ``The second set tiebreaker was a huge part of the match,'' he
said. ``I got a little lucky out there.''
	   For Ivanisevic, it marked his third defeat in a Wimbledon final.
He lost to Andre Agassi in 1992 and Sampras in 1994.
	   ``I had a chance, this was my best chance ever here,''
Ivanisevic said. ``I thought I was going to win this match.''
	   Ivanisevic, who had won only one match in his five previous
Grand Slam events and was largely overlooked as a contender this
year, was devastated by the defeat.
	   ``I know people die, but this is the worst ever,'' he said.
``Nobody died yet. I had to get motivated to play tennis again, I
don't know how long it's going to take to get over this.''
	   Ivanisevic said he would have won the match had he taken the
second set. He blamed his fifth-set fade on the marathon 28-game
fifth set in his semifinal win over Richard Krajicek.
	   ``The Krajicek match cost me this fifth set,'' he said. ``I was
more tired than him. My legs didn't listen.''
	   The match was dominated by big serves and featured few extended
rallies, another example of the power tennis which has typified
Wimbledon finals in the 1990s.
	   Ivanisevic had 32 aces and Sampras had 12. But the key statistic
was Ivanisevic's 20 double faults.
	   The match was settled in the sixth game of the fifth set when
Sampras broke for 4-2, ripping a backhand return at Ivanisevic's
feet. The Croatian couldn't dig the ball out, dumping a forehand
volley into the net.
	   After Sampras held for 5-2, a distraught Ivanisevic buried his
head in his towel and muttered to himself in Croatian during the
changeover. Sampras then broke him at love in the next game to end
the 2 hour, 52-minute match.
	   Ivanisevic said he was so drained he served ``like a woman'' in
the last game _ ``no pace, nothing there.''
	   Ivanisevic won the first set with a rollercoaster serving show
that included 13 aces and nine double faults.
	   Ivanisevic saved six break points, including four double faults
in one game, while Sampras saved three.
	   The tiebreaker went Ivanisevic's way when he hit a backhand
passing shot for a mini-break and 2-0 lead and increased the lead
to 5-2 with a forehand winner. He then followed with an ace and a
service winner.
	   The first service break of the match came in the second game of
the second set when Sampras, head to head with Ivanisevic across
the net, stabbed a reflex backhand volley to go up 2-0.
	   But Ivanisevic broke right back in the next game. It took four
break points before he converted by driving a forehand pass down
the line.
	   Sampras didn't serve his first ace until the fifth game of the
second set, when he hit three in a row.
	   Only five points went against serve over the next nine games as
the two headed into another tiebreaker.
	   Sampras saved two set points, while serving at 5-6 and 7-8, both
times Ivanisevic failing to take advantage of second serves and
hitting high backhand returns into the net.
	   ``The two set points going to my backhand I missed the balls
which is ridiculous,'' Ivanisevic said.
	   Sampras had two set points with Ivanisevic serving at 6-7 and
8-9, but the Croatian saved both with service winners.
	   The turning came on the 19th point when an Ivanisevic shot was
ruled in but was then immediately changed to out by the lineswoman.
Sampras, initially thinking he had lost the point, shouted, ``Oh,
my God,'' and held his head in his hands in disbelief.
	   But the point was replayed, and Ivanisevic sailed a sloppy
forehand volley way long to give Sampras a third set point, this
time on his own serve. He promptly hit a service winner to take the
set and even the match.
	   ``I felt the match slipping away in the breaker,'' Sampras said.
``I thought this could be Goran's year. Once I won the second set I
thought, `Now he's down and I'm up a little bit.'''
	   Sampras needed just one break in the fifth game to win the third
set.
	   Ivanisevic played a weak forehand volley into the net at deuce
to give Sampras a third break point. Sampras converted by punching
a backhand cross-court return for a winner, then pumped his right
fist and screamed, ``Yeah!''
	   In the fourth set, Ivanisevic broke at love for a 4-2 lead with
four spectacular backcourt passing shots. On the break point, he
chased a Sampras volley way off the side of the court and slammed a
forehand cross-court winner.
	   Two games later, he served his 30th ace to close out the set and
send the match into a decisive fifth.
	   Sampras received a winner's check of dlrs 722,000, while
Ivanisevic collected dlrs 361,000.

Suspected rebels kill two policemen in southern Mexico
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ About a dozen assailants believed to be
members of a leftist rebel group have killed two police officers
and wounded a third in an attack on their patrol car in southern
Guerrero state.
	   The attack by the masked, uniformed assailants occurred Saturday
on a rural highway near the remote village of Tlapa, Guerrero,
about 95 miles (150 kms) northeast of Acapulco, the government news
agency Notimex reported.
	   The suspected members of the Popular Revolutionary Army, a small
guerrilla group known as the EPR, opened fire on the patrol car
with assault rifles from a curve in the road, state Attorney
General Servando Alanis Santos said.
	   The wounded police officer was being treated at a local
hospital. A state official said no information was available on his
condition.
	   Over 150 shell casings from assault rifles were found at the
scene of the attack. Alanis Santos said the assailants wore olive
green military uniforms and black ski masks.
	   Police also blame the EPR rebels for a June 22 ambush in
Guerrero that killed three Mexican soldiers and wounded three
others.
	   The EPR rose up in Guerrero two years ago to demand political
and social reform. The group made its first appearance at a
memorial service for 17 farmworkers massacred by Guerrero state
police in 1995.
	   The latest round of attacks comes nearly one month after an army
patrol clashed with rebels in another Guerrero village, El Charco,
on June 7. The patrol killed 11 people said to be members of a
breakaway EPR group, the Insurgent People's Revolutionary Army.
	   Villagers said the army fired first and that some of those
killed were not rebels.

Atherton and Stewart hold up South Africa
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with stumps score
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ Two plucky Englishmen defied South
Africa's bowling attack for five hours Sunday, giving England the
chance to salvage a draw in the third cricket test at Old Trafford.
	   England captain Alec Stewart hammered a brilliant century and
shared a 200-run third wicket stand with Mike Atherton to delay
South Africa's push for victory.
	   Stewart, 114 not out, and Atherton, 81 not out, saved the day
after England was forced to follow-on after 26 minutes of play on
the morning of the penultimate day.
	   At stumps, England was 211 for two _ Stewart and Atherton having
come together with England's second innings in tatters at 11 for
two and batting for the duration of the day.
	   England, dismissed for 183 in the first innings, is far from
safe and has to survive another three sessions or a minimum of 90
overs on the last day to stop South Africa from taking a 2-0 lead
in the five-match series.
	   The home side is still 158 runs behind South Africa's 552 for
five declared.
	   While Atherton played a back-to-the-wall innings, Stewart took
the attack to the South African bowlers with a characteristically
aggressive captain's innings.
	   From a lunch time score of 36 for two, positive batting by the
captains past and present gave England genuine hopes of saving the
test.
	   Atherton played an innings similar to his match-saving 11 hour
innings against South Africa in Johannesburg two years ago.
	   The former England captain, who scored an unbeaten 185 to save
the second test against South Africa in 1995-96, has batted for
five hours and 17 minutes for his 237-balls innings.
	   It was Jack Russell (29 not out) who lent support to Atherton
two years ago but Sunday it was Stewart, playing his most critical
innings as new England captain, who did more than hold his end.
	   Stewart reached his 11th century in 78 tests with a straight
drive off left-arm spinner Paul Adam, who had taken 4-63 in 31
overs in England's first innings.
	   Allan Donald, who bowled 17 overs in four spells, began
England's second innings slide claiming Nick Knight for the second
time in the match.
	   Kallis took the wicket of Nasser Hussain for five shortly after
to bring Stewart and Atherton together 35 minutes before lunch. But
the England pair frustrated South Africa for the remainder of the
day.
	   South African skipper Hanse Cronje took the second new ball in
the 81st over, but after just eight balls play was called off 10
minutes short of scheduled stumps.
	   Earlier, veteran opener Gary Kirsten hit a career-best 210
before South Africa declared its first innings on 552 for five
after 13 hours of batting.

Officials: Nigerian leader ousts Abacha's security chief
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Moving to isolate a hard-line supporter of
Nigeria's late dictator, the country's new military leader has
replaced Gen. Sani Abacha's powerful chief of security with one of
his colleagues, officials said Sunday afternoon.
	   Maj. Hamza al-Mustapha, who headed of Abacha's personal corps of
bodyguards and also wielded immense power as an advisor, was
replaced last week by Maj. A.M. Aliyu, the officials said on
condition of anonymity.
	   The order was put into effect on June 30.
	   Aliyu worked with Nigeria's new leader, Gen. Abdulsalam
Abubakar, when Abubakar was the country's chief of defense staff.
	   Abubakar stepped into power after Abacha died early last month.
	   Mustapha, for his part, has not been seen in public since
Abacha's death.
	   A powerful member of the former dictator's inner circle and a
firm opponent of democratization, he was kept under house arrest
for at least part of that time as Abubakar consolidated his hold on
power.
	   Abubakar has moved swiftly since he came to power to move
Nigeria away from Abacha's repressive policies. After five years of
dictatorship, when dissidents faced harassment, imprisonment and
sometimes even death, Abubakar has being freeing Nigeria's
political prisoners.
	   Dozens of political prisoners have already left their jails, and
he has promised freedom for the rest, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan announced last week.
	   Foremost among those to be freed are Moshood Abiola, the
presumed winner of presidential elections in 1993. Abiola has been
jailed since 1994, when he declared himself president.
	   Speculation has been rife in Nigeria since Annan's announcement
as to when he'll be released. Many are predicting it will come soon
after the mourning period ends for Abacha on Tuesday. Some
government officials, though, have said it could be be delayed
because Nigeria's opposition movement has rejected Annan's
announcement that Abiola had agreed to give up his claims to the
presidency.

 &UR; World Cup: Fired-up Croats get revenge against Germans &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with coach's news conference. Trims
outdated material. Changes dateline. &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VITTEL, France (AP) _ They've just ousted mighty Germany from
the World Cup, but the Croatians don't want to stop there.
	   Coach Miroslav Blazevic, who has led Croatia into the semifinals
in its World Cup debut, geared up Sunday for his underrated team's
next opponent: host France.
	   ``I am too ambitious to say we have achieved everything we
can,'' he said after the team returned to its training camp in this
idyllic spa town.
	   France is the firm favorite in Wednesday's semifinal in Paris,
so the Croats are counting on their euphoria to carry them to
another upset _ and make Blazevic's cocky prediction that Croatia
will reach the final come true.
	   ``Few thought that as I did that we could get as far as we have
already,'' Blazevic said Sunday. ``Our joy is fanatical.''
	   A country that didn't even exist seven years ago, Croatia is
reveling in the soccer world's sudden respect after its stunning
3-0 victory at Lyon Saturday night. It made World Cup history in
the process, becoming the first team, other than the original World
Cuppers back in the 1930s, to reach the semifinals on its first
try.
	   Set ablaze by patriotism, German put-downs and a lost
quarterfinal in the 1996 European Championship, the Croats claimed
a triumph for soccer's small powers.
	   ``When I heard (German coach) Berti Vogts called us a small
country, this raised our morale by 200 percent,'' exulted star
striker Davor Suker. ``We were fired up to send the Germans
packing. This shows that small can beat big.''
	   Not that Croatia came completely out of nowhere. The squad's
core, including playmaker Zvonomir Boban of AC Milan, goes back to
the Yugoslav team that won the 1987 world youth championship.
	   Though some team members like Suker and Boban have gained fame
in Europe with their clubs, this World Cup is also the last chance
for Croatia's talented generation to make its mark on the big
stage.
	   When Yugoslavia broke up and Croatia gained independence in a
1991 war, most of its talent left for Western Europe. The team
surged onto the international stage in the 1996 European
Championship, where it was ousted in a rough quarterfinal with
Germany, the eventual champion.
	   Croatia turned the tables in Saturday's World Cup quarterfinal.
Aided by the 40th minute expulsion of German defender Christian
Woerns after a tangle with Suker, the Croats got a goal in
first-half injury time from Robert Jarni.
	   The Germans, seeking their fourth world title, never recovered
and with an extra man, the Croats were free to run an often
sparkling counterattack game after the break.
	   Goran Vlaovic knocked in goal No. 2 in the 80th minute and Suker
added to the Germans' misery with a classy close-range tally five
minutes from the end, the Real Madrid striker's fourth of the
tournament.
	   ``For 45 years in Yugoslavia, we never played with the same fire
as we are for Croatia,'' declared defender Igor Stimac, whose
sending off in the 1996 game contributed to the Croat loss.

Mandela: permanent members of U.N. Security Council should
</HEADLINE>
surrender veto &QL; 
 &UR; By GUY ELLIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CASTRIES, St. Lucia (AP) _ South African President Nelson
Mandela urged developing countries to demand that the five
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council give up their veto
power.
	   Speaking Saturday night before a summit of the Caribbean
Community trade bloc on the island of St. Lucia, Mandela called for
the ``democratization'' of the United Nations and said it is unfair
that China, France, Russia, the United States and Britain can
override decisions by the 10 rotating members of the council.
	   The Security Council is responsible for maintaining peace and
stability among the 185 member states of the United Nations.
	   Mandela said the issue would dominate a meeting of nonaligned
countries in South Africa in August.
	   Eliminating the veto power would give small countries a greater
say in their fate, Mandela said.
	   ``The fact that a country is small, both geographically and in
population, does not mean that it is unimportant,'' he said. ``What
is tragic is that a country should be small and coward.''
	   Mandela ended a three-day visit to the summit on Saturday.

 &UR; Politicians call for tougher border checks to prevent flood of
refugees &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ With continued fighting over a Serb
crackdown on restive ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, calls stepped up
Sunday in Germany for more border controls to prevent a new flood
of refugees into Europe.
	   The Hamburg-based Bild am Sonntag reported that Berlin Mayor
Eberhard Diepgen had sent a letter to Interior Minister Manfred
Kanther asking for sharper border controls within the EU, but
especially between German and Austria.
	   The report quoted Diepgen as saying that Berlin has already
exhausted its facilities, with 20,000 refugees from Bosnia still
sheltered in the city. Germany took in some 350,000 refugees during
Bosnia's 3 1/2 year war and many remain.
	   ``I must decisively decline to accept any additional refugees,''
the report quoted Diepgen as saying.
	   A German foreign ministry statement on Thursday said there is
concern because some 150,000 ethnic Albanians from Kosovo who were
to be returned to their homeland currently are in Germany, with an
additional 1,000 to 2,000 arriving monthly.
	   In a Sunday interview with Berlin radio station 100.6, Austrian
Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel, the current EU Commission
chairman, said he wanted to start an initiative to bring new order
to the refugee situation in the European Union.
	   It can't go on that Germany and Austria bear the main burden for
accepting civil war refugees and asylum seekers, Schuessel told the
station.
	   Schuessel warned western nations against publicly discussing
controversial positions on how to deal with the situation in
Kosovo, saying it sends the wrong signal to the Serbs.
	   He said it should be made clear to the Serbs that in an
emergency military force could be used to reach a solution in
Kosovo, but only with Russia. ``Without the Russians nothing goes
in the U.N. Security Council.''
	   Hundreds of people have died in Kosovo since Serb forces stepped
up efforts to crush militant resistance in February.
	   Ethnic Albanian separatists want independence for Kosovo, a
province in southern Serbia where Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1.
	   While NATO has indicated it might take military action to stop
the trouble in Kosovo from spreading, Russia has warned that it
will not accept such a move against the Serbs.

Officials: Nigerian leader ousts Abacha's security chief

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Moving to isolate a hard-line supporter of
Nigeria's late dictator, the country's new military leader has
replaced Gen. Sani Abacha's powerful chief of security with one of
his colleagues, officials said Sunday afternoon.
	   Maj. Hamza al-Mustapha, who headed of Abacha's personal corps of
bodyguards and also wielded immense power as an advisor, was
replaced last week by Maj. A.M. Aliyu, the officials said on
condition of anonymity.
	   The order was put into effect on June 30.
	   Aliyu worked with Nigeria's new leader, Gen. Abdulsalam
Abubakar, when Abubakar was the country's chief of defense staff.
	   Abubakar stepped into power after Abacha died early last month.
	   Mustapha, for his part, has not been seen in public since
Abacha's death.
	   A powerful member of the former dictator's inner circle and a
firm opponent of democratization, he was kept under house arrest
for at least part of that time as Abubakar consolidated his hold on
power.
	   Abubakar has moved swiftly since he came to power to move
Nigeria away from Abacha's repressive policies. After five years of
dictatorship, when dissidents faced harassment, imprisonment and
sometimes even death, Abubakar has being freeing Nigeria's
political prisoners.
	   Dozens of political prisoners have already left their jails, and
he has promised freedom for the rest, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan announced last week.
	   Foremost among those to be freed are Moshood Abiola, the
presumed winner of presidential elections in 1993. Abiola has been
jailed since 1994, when he declared himself president.
	   Speculation has been rife in Nigeria since Annan's announcement
as to when he'll be released. Many are predicting it will come soon
after the mourning period ends for Abacha on Tuesday. Some
government officials, though, have said it could be be delayed
because Nigeria's opposition movement has rejected Annan's
announcement that Abiola had agreed to give up his claims to the
presidency.

Comedy scriptwriter Speight, creator of Alf Garnett, dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Johnny Speight, an acclaimed British comedy writer
who created Alf Garnett, the Cockney bigot known to millions in the
TV series ``Till Death Us Do Part,'' died Sunday. He was 78.
	   Speight, whose series aired in the United States titled ``All in
the Family'' with Garnett called Archie Bunker, continued writing
until a few weeks before his death, his younger son, Francis, said.
He died of cancer of the pancreas at his home at Chorleywood, near
London.
	   ``There are very few writers who can claim to have created a
character who embodied a spirit of a generation,'' said the British
Broadcasting Corp.'s Controller of Entertainment, Paul Jackson.
``Johnny Speight did this with Alf Garnett. He will always be
remembered as the man who created a comic icon for the age.''
	   From his London East End home, Alf Garnett, the antithesis of
political correctness, expounded his views on race, the neighbors,
immigration and politics, all the while dealing his wife classic
put-downs. Often a picture of the woman Garnett admired most, Queen
Elizabeth II, was visible on a wall.
	   The series, which first appeared in 1964, and its sequel ``In
Sickness and in Health,'' ranked among the BBC's greatest comedy
hits.
	   Speight, the son of a dockworker, was born in the East End and
left school at 14 to take a job in a factory.
	   A jazz enthusiast, he started in entertainment as the drummer in
a local jazz band.
	   In 1956 came what was to be the big break: a friend introduced
him to three new comic talents, Spike Milligan, Frankie Howerd and
Eric Sykes, and he wrote for them, rapidly earning big fees.
	   Through hard-drinking and huge success, Speight's family
remained his rock, and his own left-wing political views unchanged.
He recently wrote of his marriage to Connie, who he met when she
was 17, ``I couldn't bear to think of life without her. Our story
really could be called `Till Death Us Do Part'.''
	   He is survived by his wife and their three children, two sons
and a daughter.
	   Funeral arrangements were not immediately announced.

Carter denies Montgomerie third successive Irish Open title
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ David Carter denied Colin Montgomerie of
his third successive Irish Open title Sunday by winning the first
hole of a sudden death play-off.
	   South African-born Carter clinched his first European tour title
when Montgomerie missed a bogey putt on the first play-off hole on
the 18th at Druids Glen.
	   The pair finished level at six-under-par 278 after 72 holes but
Carter took the dlrs 276,656 winner's purse following the play-off.
	   The 26-year-old had squandered a four stroke lead with two
bogeys and a double bogey over the last six holes but holed a
20-foot putt on the 18th to force the play-off.
	   Carter, who now lives in Chesterfield, was lucky to be back on
the tour after emergency brain surgey in Dubai last year.
	   ``I'm lucky to be here and that's something I don't forget,''
Carter said. ``I kept saying `believe in yourself' and when I had
that putt to tie I kept saying to myself `you're going to hole
it'.''
	   ``When you almost die to come out and play golf and win is an
unbelievable feeling. I've got so many people to thank, including
of course the surgeon.''
	   Montgomerie, back as European No.1, shot a final-round 68 to
Carter's 71 but his injury-affected second round 74 ultimately cost
him a record-equalling third Irish Open title.
	   Ireland's John McHenry finished joint third with Peter Baker,
sharing the dlrs 104,000 prize money after failing to win a cent on
tour this season.
	   World No.10 Lee Westwood had threatened to post a challenging
clubhouse target when he played his first 11 holes in five under
but fell away to a 69.
	   Westwood finished with one-over in 15th place, losing the top
spot on the European tour money list to Montgomerie in the process.
	   World No.2 Ernie Els had a disasterous last round, not managing
a single birdie in a 78 that sent him tumbling from even to six
over and 33rd place.
	   Nick Faldo followed up his third round 67 with a 74 and finished
in 27th place.

Calves cloned from adult cells in Japan

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Two calves born Sunday are the first clones from
cells from an adult cow, Japanese scientists said Sunday.
	   The so far unnamed twins were born exactly two years after
Dolly, the British sheep that made history by becoming the first
clone of an adult animal.
	   The two calves are the second adult-animal clones, and were
produced by a similar technique, said Toyokazu Morita, an official
of the Ishikawa Prefectural Livestock Research Center.
	   ``We have succeeded in producing calves from adult-animal
clones, meaning that we can produce calves exactly similar to adult
cows,'' said Morita.
	   He said the new technique would be used to breed better cattle
strains with higher-quality beef or greater milk capacity.
	   ``I think it's a very important step in the scientific
process,'' said Caird Rexroad, assistant deputy administrator for
the U.S. Department of Agriculture's research service. ``There have
been a few questions about Dolly ... and confirmation would be
good.''
	   He said the Japanese success is important primarily because it
cloned another species. ``It suggests the technique may be
generally usable,'' Rexroad said.
	   Another cloning expert, Robert H. Foote, said, ``I suppose you
could say that if you can clone sheep and cattle from an adult,
then the probability of cloning an adult human being is less
remote.''
	   Foote, a professor of animal physiology at Cornell University in
Ithaca, New York, said the Japanese success has ``substantial
significance.''
	   The breakthrough of cloning an adult means scientists could
clone proven animals. For example, adult cows that produce more
milk for market or for pharmaceuticals like blood clotters could be
chosen for cloning instead of relying on the relative uncertainty
of cells from a fetus, Foote said.
	   ``From a scientific standpoint, it is very important to have
done it with another species,'' he said.
	   That's because it discounts the possibility that Dolly's success
was the result of some unknown characteristic of sheep. Cloning a
cow is also important from a practical standpoint because cows
produce more milk than sheep, Foote said.

Mandela: permanent members of U.N. Security Council should
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to FIX slug &QL; 
surrender veto &QL; 
 &UR; By GUY ELLIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CASTRIES, St. Lucia (AP) _ South African President Nelson
Mandela urged developing countries to demand that the five
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council give up their veto
power.
	   Speaking Saturday night before a summit of the Caribbean
Community trade bloc on the island of St. Lucia, Mandela called for
the ``democratization'' of the United Nations and said it is unfair
that China, France, Russia, the United States and Britain can
override decisions by the 10 rotating members of the council.
	   The Security Council is responsible for maintaining peace and
stability among the 185 member states of the United Nations.
	   Mandela said the issue would dominate a meeting of nonaligned
countries in South Africa in August.
	   Eliminating the veto power would give small countries a greater
say in their fate, Mandela said.
	   ``The fact that a country is small, both geographically and in
population, does not mean that it is unimportant,'' he said. ``What
is tragic is that a country should be small and coward.''
	   Mandela ended a three-day visit to the summit on Saturday.

British-Irish tourist who walked into Egypt arrested

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A British tourist who accidentally wandered into
Egypt while out on a walk from the Israeli holiday resort of Eilat,
has been detained in Egypt, the Foreign Office said Sunday.
	   Gerry Bowen, 33, who also has dual Irish nationality, went
walking Friday during a vacation with friends at Eilat. When he
failed to return, his companions raised the alarm, said the
spokesman, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Israeli police called off a search on Saturday evening after
hearing from Eygptian auithorities he was being held at the Taba
border.
	   Bowen, who apparently crossed the border about 5 miles (8 kms)
from Eilat, lives near Norwich, in eastern England.
	   The Foreign Office said Irish diplomats were trying to get Bowen
released and find out why he was held. ``We haven't got any answers
to those questions yet,'' said the spokesman.

Kazak president in Moscow to sign deal on Caspian resources
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Since Boris Yeltsin wouldn't come to Kazakstan,
Kazak President Nursultan Nazarbayev came to Moscow on Sunday in
hopes of signing a crucial agreement on how to divide up the
Caspian Sea.
	   The Russian president had been scheduled to go to Kazakstan last
week, but canceled the trip to deal with Russia's economic crisis.
Nazarbayev, eager to sign the Caspian agreement, decided at the
last minute to meet Yeltsin in Moscow.
	   The ITAR-Tass news agency said the Kazak president is expected
to meet Yeltsin and Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko on Monday to
sign agreements on power sharing in the Caspian.
	   Russia and Kazakstan agreed earlier this year that the seabed of
the Caspian, one of the most promising sources of oil and gas in
the world, will be divided into national sectors, while the water
and surface will be shared.
	   Iran, which also borders the Caspian, strictly opposes that
settlement. It wants the Caspian resources shared rather than
divided. The other Caspian nations, Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan,
support the division into sectors.
	   The agreement is vital for the development of the sea's oil
deposits, which Nazarbayev wants to get under way.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. and Russian envoys urged
Albanian politicians Sunday to rally behind moderate leader Ibrahim
Rugova, insisting he is the best choice to speak for Kosovo's
Albanian majority in future talks with the Yugoslav government.
	   U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister
Nikolai Afanasyevsky drove that message home during talks
throughout the day with Rugova and representatives of all 16
Albanian political parties.
	   Absent from the meetings were representatives of the militant
Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for independence from
Serbia, which along with Montenegro forms what remains of
Yugoslavia.
	   Holbrooke, who has been shuttling between Pristina and the
Yugoslav capital Belgrade since Friday, is trying to convince all
Albanian factions _ including the KLA _ to accept Rugova's
leadership.
	   The KLA has so far refused, and it was unclear whether
Holbrooke's latest effort had narrowed the differences within the
factious Albanian community.
	   ``We have continued extensive dialogue all day long with Dr.
Rugova and other political leaders,'' Holbrooke said before
returning to Belgrade. ``Dr. Rugova himself is going to continue to
seek a broader base for his goal, which is a negotiated peaceful
settlement to the Kosovo problem.''
	   Afanasyevsky also urged support for Rugova and repeated Moscow's
refusal to negotiate directly with the KLA _ which Russia and
Belgrade consider a terrorist organization.
	   Standing alongside Holbrooke and Rugova, Afanasyevsky ``we came
to Pristina today to say to Mr. Rugova and his team that we support
them as we support their peaceful platform. We think that we must
act swiftly and energetically.''
	   Referring to the KLA, Afanasyevsky said Russia sees no reason to
negotiate with those who ``kill citizens who are loyal to Serbia.''
	   The goal of U.S. and Russian mediation is to help the Albanians
overcome their differences and speak with a single voice in
negotiations with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic over the
future of the province.
	   Milosevic has expressed willingness to restore autonomy he
canceled in 1989. Vojislav Zivkovic, a member of Milosevic's party
told state-run Radio Belgrade Sunday that ``Serbia is ready for a
dialogue to solve the Kosovo problem'' on the condition it doesn't
harm Serbs living in the province.
	   But Rugova and others are demanding full independence.
Nevertheless, Rugova is considered a more acceptable negotiating
partner because he opposes violence.
	   The Serb crackdown, which has claimed hundreds of lives since
late February, has undercut Rugova's moderate appeal. The German
news magazine Spiegel quoted self-styled KLA spokesman Jakub
Krasniqi as saying his organization would never accept Rugova as a
leader because non-violence had failed to gain independence or halt
the crackdown.
	   The Serb Media Center reported ethnic Albanian militants
attacked Serb police and Serb villagers in two separate incidents
in northwest Kosovo Sunday. Militants also kidnapped three Serb
civilians late Saturday from villages southwest of Pristina, the
center said.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to Rugovo, claimed that
fighting had flared up again in a strategic mining region that saw
heavy fighting last week. It was not possible to confirm the
reports independently.
	   As part of the diplomatic effort to curb the crisis,
Belgrade-based diplomats from the United States, Russia, Poland and
the European Union are to visit flashpoints in Kosovo on Monday.
	   Milosevic approved the visits last month under an agreement with
Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who was seeking to discourage NATO
military action against Serb security forces.
	   Rugova urged Kosovo Albanians to cooperate with the observer
mission.

McEnroe outspoken about players giving less than 100 percent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Three-time Wimbledon champion John
McEnroe says the biggest problem with men's tennis is that too many
players give an inconsistent effort, even at Grand Slam events.
	   ``How can these guys who make millions of dollars a year appear
to not care at Wimbledon?'' McEnroe said.
	   ``It's embarrassing. I hope and pray that changes soon, so that
every time a tennis player steps on the court, he feels an
obligation to give 110 percent.''
	   McEnroe spoke specifically of second-ranked Marcelo Rios of
Chile, who lost in the opening round and then ripped Wimbledon as
``just another tournament.''
	   ``Rios has had a great year,'' McEnroe said. ``His problem is he
came in here and didn't give this the respect it deserved.''
	   Men's rankings will put more emphasis on Grand Slam results
beginning in 2000, a change that McEnroe favors. He also supports
moving the service line closer to the net, making the serve a less
dominant shot.
	   Aces have been plentiful at Wimbledon again this year. Goran
Ivanisevic got 32 in losing Sunday's final to Pete Sampras, who won
his fifth title to match Bjorn Borg's mark.
	   ``It's a server's paradise,'' McEnroe said. ``Because of the
power, players don't volley as well, but they don't need to. Guys
are hitting rockets.
	   ``Serving has become so big that you don't have to follow it up
with a solid volley, and I think that's what people want to see.
They want to see all parts of the game.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   TIM FOR PRESIDENT: &LR;  Tim Henman, who reached the Wimbledon
semifinals to become the first Briton since 1973 to do it, is among
the top candidates to become the new president of the ATP Tour
Players' Council. Spain's Alex Corretja recently stepped down.
Henman is on a short list of three candidates including American
Todd Martin and Russia's Yevgeny Kafelnikov. The council represents
the players interests to the ATP.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   WILLIAMS SISTERS CASH IN: &LR;  Serena Williams, who pulled out in
the third round of singles with a calf injury while trailing
Spain's Virginia Ruano-Pascual, won the mixed doubles title Sunday
with Max Mirnyi of Belarus.
	   They defeated Mahesh Bhupathi of India and Mirjana Lucic of
Croatia, 6-4, 6-4. The win was worth 36,100 pounds (dlrs 59,900) to
the 16-year-old American.
	   Serena also picked up 13,650 pounds (dlrs 22,660) for reaching
the third round in singles.
	   Sister Venus Williams, 18, won 48,070 pounds (dlrs 80,000) for
making the quarterfinals in singles and 18,920 (dlrs 31,400) for
reaching the mixed doubles semifinals.
	   The two pulled out of women's doubles _ following Serena's
injury _ without playing a match.
	   Not a bad two week's work for the teen-agers.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ROYAL BOX: &LR;  VIPs in the royal box for the men's final Sunday
included Croatian Prime Minister Zlatko Matesa and U.S. Ambassador
to Britain Philip Lader. Also on hand three-time Wimbledon champion
Boris Becker, 1937 and 1938 champion Don Budge, singer-actress
Julie Andrews and IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SERVE AND VOLLEY: &LR;  Jana Novotna on winning the women's doubles
with Martina Hingis after taking the singles title Saturday: ``I
don't think it can get any better than this next year,'' she said.
``It felt different (walking back on the court) after last night's
celebration. I did well. I should go out like that more often.''
	   Pete Sampras picked up 435,000 pounds (dlrs 722,000) and
runner-up Goran Ivanisevic got 217,500 (dlrs 361,000) for Sunday's
final.

Sampras ties Borg with 5th Wimbledon title
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: AMS; RECASTS with new material throughout; changes byline &QL; 
 &UR; By STEVE WILSTEIN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Tennis Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Just when everyone thought it was safe
to play Pete Sampras, a champion beset by burnout, he unleashed his
finest tennis in his toughest Grand Slam final Sunday to capture a
record-tying fifth Wimbledon title.
	   Pressured by a barrage of 32 aces that often left him shaking
his head, Sampras couldn't afford even a moment's letdown in a 6-7
(7-2), 7-6 (11-9), 6-4, 3-6, 6-2 victory over brokenhearted,
three-time runner-up Goran Ivanisevic.
	   ``Now I guess I'm out of my slump,'' Sampras said with a smile.
	   Sampras had been shut out of every major final since winning
Wimbledon a year ago, briefly lost his No. 1 ranking, and the
whispers on the men's circuit were that he had lost his edge, the
desire it takes to train and win. Sampras himself admitted burnout
had gotten to him after ruling tennis for five years. Former
Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek even weighed in last week with
the idea that Sampras was playing more like a No. 10 than a No. 1.
	   Not this tournament, and certainly not in the final.
	   A month shy of 27, Sampras showed the full range of his tennis
artistry in tying Bjorn Borg for the most Wimbledon men's
championships of the 30-year Open era, and matching Borg and
boyhood idol Rod Laver with 11 Grand Slam titles. Only Roy Emerson,
with 12, has won more majors.
	   ``Borg's five I thought would never be broken,'' said Sampras,
who also won dlrs 722,0000 to push his career earnings past dlrs 33
million. ``I think I've got some years left in me so that I can,
hopefully, do it again.''
	   Sampras took this one _ his first five-set Grand Slam final _ as
much with his craft as with consistency and will. Stroke for
stroke, little separated him from Ivanisevic, whose left-handed
serves are among the most intimidating in tennis. The radar speed
gun clocked them both with serves up to 134 mph.
	   ``Compared to all the finals I've played, this is by far the
toughest,'' Sampras said. ``I didn't think I was quite in control
of the match, and Goran was playing huge. I got a little bit lucky
out there, I must admit, and raised my level just enough in the
fifth set. And before I knew it, I won it.''
	   For Ivanisevic, performing in front of Croatia's prime minister
in the Royal Box, the loss hurt more than any in his career. He had
played one of the greatest Wimbledon finals, serving 37 aces
against Andre Agassi in 1992, and lost. He fell to Sampras after
two tiebreakers in the 1994 final. But he described this as one
that would torment him the rest of his career.
	   ``It hurts most because this time I had the chance,'' Ivanisevic
said. ``He didn't play well.''
	   As Sampras carried his trophy in a lap of honor for the fifth
time in six years, Ivanisevic slumped in his chair in the deepest
gloom. He had no desire to make his way around the court himself,
holding his little runner's up prize.
	   Ivanisevic was harder on himself than he deserved. He volleyed
well, Sampras a tad better with a bit more range. Ivanisevic nearly
tripled Sampras' 12 aces, but also nearly tripled his double faults
_ 20 to 8. Ivanisevic returned solidly when he could get his racket
on the ball, and so did Sampras.
	   This was not a match of clever tactics. Rather it was a slugfest
of brute force. There wasn't a rally longer than eight strokes, not
one exchange where the players stayed behind the baseline for more
than a couple of strokes.
	   It was grasscourt tennis at its fastest and best, but a total
bore for those who prefer well constructed points, efficient
movement and soft touch. For almost the entire 2 hours, 52 minutes,
the players whacked serves that couldn't be returned, then walked
to the other side to do it again.
	   Ivanisevic took the first set without a break when he sneaked a
couple of passing shots by Sampras on his serve in the tiebreak.
The second set had one exchange of breaks in the second and third
games, then went to another and more tense tiebreak, with Sampras
winning the ``crap shoot'' this time. The slightest letdown by
Ivanisevic _ a volley long that made it 10-9 _ allowed Sampras to
serve for the set for the first time. Sampras didn't waste the
chance, drilling a service winner to tie the match.
	   Ivanisevic is infamous for losing his temper, but in this match,
like most of his others this Wimbledon, he stayed remarkably
composed. Sure, he cracked his racket once when he bounced it on
the court, and, yes, he flung his racket around a couple of other
times, but for the fiery Croatian that was tame stuff.
	   Even when Sampras broke him for a 3-2 lead in the third set and
bellowed in triumph while pumping his fist, Ivanisevic stayed in
control of himself and dug in to fight back. But Sampras never gave
him the chance, raising his game now as if smelling blood. Sampras
suddenly was lunging all over the court, pounding winners from both
sides and at the net, and yielding only two points on serve in his
next three service games to close out the set.
	   As tired as Ivanisevic might have been two days after his
five-set semifinal marathon against Krajicek, which ended 15-13 in
the last set, he mustered enough strength to win the only break of
the fourth set against Sampras.
	   Ivanisevic even came up with the most spectacular shot of the
match in that set _ a half-volley between the legs that helped him
take a 3-2 lead on serve. He then broke Sampras at 15-40 with a
brilliant running forehand pass crosscourt, and closed out the set
with his 30th ace.
	   But Sampras, who is 26-9 in five setters, showed he still has
the stamina and will to go the distance. At 3-2 in the fifth set,
he reached break point with a sizzling backhand pass that barely
clipped the frame of Ivanisevic's outstretched racket. Sampras
followed that with a huge forehand return that Ivanisevic caught on
the half volley at his feet but couldn't get back to the net.
	   ``15-13 against Krajicek cost me this final today,'' Ivanisevic
said. ``In the fourth and fifth set, my legs were not fresh.''
	   Ivanisevic flung his racket in disgust when he went to the chair
after Sampras held to 5-2, and both players knew the match would
soon be over. Ivanisevic buried his face in a towel, his dream all
but gone. Sampras covered his whole head in a towel, retreating to
darkness for a few moments to keep his mind on the business at
hand.
	   The match lasted only a minute longer, Ivanisevic going down in
a heap at love with the help of one more double fault and a final
volley long under pressure from Sampras.

Queen to hire royal train to the right people to save money
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Queen Elizabeth II, as part of a drive to cut down
on the royals' 17.3 million pound (dlrs 28.5 million) annual travel
costs, is to hire out the royal train, _ but only to
``appropriate'' people, Buckingham Palace said Sunday.
	   ``There will be the opportunity for appropriate organizations to
use the royal train,'' said a palace spokeswoman. ``Each case will
be treated on its own merits.''
	   And that was as far as the spokeswoman, speaking on condition of
anonymity, would go _ declining to specify who would qualify as the
right type to rent the royal train with its maroon cars, dining
room and servants' quarters. Nor was there any word of the cost.
	   However, big businesses were expected to be among the first
customers.
	   The announcement followed the publication June 30 of the first
annual report on royal travel, showing the queen had saved 2
million pounds (dlrs 3.3 million) over the year ending March,
nearly half of it by cutting back on use of the royal train.
	   It costs some 10,000 pounds (dlrs 16,500) each time the queen
takes a journey.
	   The report showed the royals getting serious about
belt-tightening. Prince Philip, 77, the queen's husband, and her
sister Princess Margaret, 67, each took journeys on regular trains
using concession tickets for senior citizens.
	   The queen has already let some outsiders on board the royal
train. Wives of the heads of Group of Eight leading industrialized
nations traveled in it to visit the prime minister's country
residence during a summit meeting in May in the central England
city of Birmingham.
	   The royal travel report was part of drive by the royals to seem
less remote, more open, and less expensive.

Novotna, Hingis take doubles; Serena Williams takes mixed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Just 24 hours after claiming the
Wimbledon singles title, Jana Novotna added a doubles victory
teaming with partner Martina Hingis to defeat No. 2 Lindsay
Davenport and Natasha Zvereva 6-3, 3-6, 8-6.
	   Hingis and Novotna shared 154,160 pounds (dlrs 256,000) for
their win, which was a repeat of the top seeded pair's French Open
triumph over the same opponents.
	   Davenport and Zvereva have only twice failed to reach the final
in the 12 events they have played together.
	   Mixed doubles went to unseeded Max Mirnyi of Belarus and Serena
Williams of the United States as they defeated No. 5 Mahesh
Bhupathi of India and Mirjana Lucic of Croatia 6-4, 6-4.
	   In men's doubles on Saturday, top seeds Jacco Eltingh and Paul
Haarhuis of the Netherlands, beat the second-seeded Australian team
of Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde 2-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7-3), 5-7,
10-8.
	   The Australians failed to win a sixth straight title, which
would have set a new Wimbledon record.
	   Hingis and Novotna sped to a 5-0 lead in the first set, and
although Novotna dropped her serve at 5-1 Hingis was able to serve
out safely at the next attempt.
	   In the second set, Davenport and Hingis both conceded their
serves to level the set at 3-3, before Novotna double faulted at
3-4 and Zvereva served out the set.
	   In the deciding set, Hingis lost her serve to love in the
opening game, but Davenport double faulted to level the set at 2-2.
Hingis dropped her serve again in the next game, but Davenport
again lost her serve to take the set to 4-4.
	   Novotna placed the Czech/Swiss combo under stress, as a double
fault left Davenport serving at 6-5 for victory.
	   But the American squandered her chance, dropping her serve to
love, and Zvereva then served another double fault on match point.
	   Novotna has won 10 Grand Slam doubles titles, including four at
Wimbledon, but had never won a Grand Slam singles until Saturday.
	   ``To win both titles at the same time, there's nothing better
than that,'' said Novotna.
	   ``She deserves it. Great effort,'' said her partner, who was
beaten by Novotna in singles.
	   For Novotna, returning to the All England Club on Sunday as
singles champion was a new experience.
	   ``It felt different, especially after last night's
celebration,'' Novotna said. ``I wasn't myself at all until I
walked on the Centre Court. I did well. I should celebrate more
often, have this kind of preparation just before a doubles final.''

Calves cloned from adult cells in Japan

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Two calves born Sunday are the first clones from
cells from an adult cow, Japanese scientists said Sunday.
	   The so far unnamed twins were born exactly two years after
Dolly, the British sheep that made history by becoming the first
clone of an adult animal.
	   The two calves are the second adult-animal clones _ after Dolly_
and were produced by a similar technique, said Toyokazu Morita, an
official of the Ishikawa Prefectural Livestock Research Center.
	   ``We have succeeded in producing calves from adult-animal
clones, meaning that we can produce calves exactly similar to adult
cows,'' said Morita.
	   He said the new technique would be used to breed better cattle
strains with higher-quality beef or greater milk capacity.
	   ``I think it's a very important step in the scientific
process,'' said Caird Rexroad, assistant deputy administrator for
the U.S. Department of Agriculture's research service. ``There have
been a few questions about Dolly ... and confirmation would be
good.''
	   He said the Japanese success is important primarily because it
cloned another species. ``It suggests the technique may be
generally usable,'' Rexroad said.
	   Another cloning expert, Robert H. Foote, said, ``I suppose you
could say that if you can clone sheep and cattle from an adult,
then the probability of cloning an adult human being is less
remote.''
	   Foote, a professor of animal physiology at Cornell University in
Ithaca, New York, said the Japanese success has ``substantial
significance.''
	   The breakthrough of cloning an adult means scientists could
clone proven animals. For example, adult cows that produce more
milk for market or for pharmaceuticals like blood clotters could be
chosen for cloning instead of relying on the relative uncertainty
of cells from a fetus, Foote said.
	   ``From a scientific standpoint, it is very important to have
done it with another species,'' he said.
	   That's because it discounts the possibility that Dolly's success
was the result of some unknown characteristic of sheep. Cloning a
cow is also important from a practical standpoint because cows
produce more milk than sheep, Foote said.
	   On Feb. 16, scientists in the United States produced a clone
calf _ a Holstein named Gene _ but Gene's genes originated in a
cell from a 30-day-old fetus rather than an adult cell. The
following day, Dutch scientists produced two cloned calves using
the same technique.

Ivanisevic devastated by another runnerup finish
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEVEN WINE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Goran Ivanisevic knew the routine. He
shook hands with the Duke and Duchess of Kent, reluctantly accepted
his runnerup trophy, gave the crowd a halfhearted wave and then
stepped aside for the Wimbledon champion.
	   Once again, the champion was Pete Sampras.
	   Ivanisevic came in second at Wimbledon for the third time
Sunday, and the latest loss was his toughest yet. Sampras earned
his fifth Wimbledon title in a tense three-hour slugfest, 6-7
(7-2), 7-6 (11-9), 6-4, 3-6, 6-2.
	   The mercurial Ivanisevic, who possesses both a quick wit and a
quick temper, was neither funny nor mad afterward.
	   He was devastated.
	   ``It feels bad,'' the big Croatian said. ``I cannot describe it.
It's the worst moment in my life.
	   ``I've had some bad moments, you know, when you are sick or when
somebody dies, but for me this is the worst thing ever. Nobody died
yet, but it's tough.''
	   Even the mention of Croatia's World Cup victory Saturday over
Germany failed to brighten his mood.
	   ``I cannot cheer anybody now,'' he said. ``I can only kill
myself.''
	   Ivanisevic and Jana Novotna entered the finals trying to shake
labels as the most talented active players without a Grand Slam
title. Each had been a runnerup at Wimbledon twice previously.
	   The parallel ended there. Novotna won; Ivanisevic lost.
	   ``At this level, with Goran and me playing the way we do on
grass, it's not really much that separates us,'' Sampras said.
``He's going to win this event. His game is too big, and his serve
is too big. He has come close three times now.''
	   Ivanisevic lost a five-set final to Andre Agassi in 1992. He
lost in straight sets to Sampras in 1994.
	   Now, the 26-year-old lefty with the booming serve can't be sure
whether he'll get another shot at a Wimbledon title _ or whether
he'll even try again.
	   ``This doesn't motivate me at all to come back,'' he said.
``It's tough. I have to push myself if I can. I don't know how long
it's going to take, but I have to try.''
	   Others have suffered repeated frustrations on the Centre Court
grass. Ken Rosewall went 0-for-4 in Wimbledon finals, while Fred
Stolle finished second three consecutive years and never won the
title.
	   That was of no consolation to the 1998 runnerup.
	   Ivanisevic's shaky psyche held up well for most of the match. He
broke a racket in anger, complained about calls and chastised
himself in a voice audible 30 rows up. But he didn't unravel under
pressure the way he's done in the past.
	   He did, however, come up short at the most important moments,
squandering seven of nine break-point chances. His 32 aces weren't
enough; his 20 double faults were too many.
	   Ivanisevic fretted about failing to convert two set points in
the second-set tiebreaker, which allowed Sampras to even the match
at one set each.
	   ``If I would go up 2-0, that's a different story,'' Ivanisevic
said. ``I don't think he would come back. No chance.''
	   Instead, Ivanisevic fell behind, then tired after playing a
15-13 fifth set against Richard Krajicek in Friday's semifinals. He
won only three points in the final four games.
	   ``I gave everything in that fourth set, and then it was like
somebody hit me,'' he said. ``That last game, I hit three first
serves ... like a woman serving.''
	   He sailed a backhand long on match point, then met a jubilant
Sampras at the net, shaking his head as they spoke. The
conversation was brief.
	   ``What can you say? `Bad luck?' He doesn't want to hear that,''
Sampras said. ``He just probably wants to be left alone. I'm sure
this match will replay in his mind for many months.''
	   The replays began immediately. While waiting to accept the
consolation trophy, Ivanisevic sat for a long time in his courtside
chair with a towel draped over his head, talking to himself.
	   Later, he tossed the trophy in his bag, alongside the busted
racket. Then he walked slowly off Centre Court, uncertain whether
he'll ever be back.

<TEXT>
	   KOHLER, Wisconsin (AP) _ The winds were calmer but the pressure
and scores stayed high at the U.S. Women's Open.
	   Se Ri Pak went after her second straight victory in a major
Sunday, but her 40 on the front nine dropped her into second place
at the turn.
	   Liselotte Neumann, Jenny Chuasiriporn and Chris Johnson shared
the lead midway through the final round at 5-over for the
tournament.
	   If the Open ends in a tie, there will be an 18-hole playoff
Monday.
	   Pak had three bogeys and a double-bogey on the front nine. The
20-year-old rookie from South Korea went into the final round at
Blackwolf Run Golf Course with a one-stroke lead over Mhairi McKay
and Neumann.
	   McKay was two strokes off the lead at the turn after a
triple-bogey on No. 7, where it took her three shots to escape the
bunker, and a bogey on eight.
	   Although the weather proved more accommodating than it did for
Saturday's ghastly round, pin placements remained difficult and the
pressure only intensified for the challengers.
	   McKay's misadventure on No. 7 bumped her from a one-shot lead at
3-over to 6-over.
	   Johnson, playing two groups ahead of the last one, started the
day 5-over and stayed there through 11 holes. She is playing in her
20th Open.
	   With 36 golfers in the clubhouse, only Lorie Kane came in under
par. Her 1-under-70 made her the first player to break par on the
Pete Dye-designed layout since Friday. She finished at 14-over 298.
	   After only 19 players bettered par the first two days, none
finished in red figures on Saturday. McKay's 73 was as good as it
got.
	   Stephanie Lowe, 11 back to start the day, eagled the 335-yard
(305-meter) par-4 Sunday but still finished with an 80 and a 308.
	   The Open winner receives dlrs 267,500 of the dlrs 1.5 million
purse.
	   Pak, who won the LPGA Championship in May, was seeking to become
the first rookie to win two majors since Juli Inkster captured the
Nabisco Dinah Shore and du Maurier Ltd. Classic in 1984. The last
woman to win consecutive majors was Meg Mallon in 1991.
	   McKay, a 23-year-old from Scotland, was trying to become the
first golfer to win the Open on her first attempt since Kathy
Cornelius in 1956.
	   McKay turned pro last year after winning the 1997 Pac-10
championship while at Stanford and has not won at all on the LPGA
tour, much less an Open. Her best finish was 28th at the Longs
Drugs Challenge in April.
	   Neumann, the 1988 Open winner, teed off with Chuasiriporn.
Neumann was counting on her 13 years of experience on the tour, 10
more than Pak, McKay and Chuasiriporn combined. She also was glad
not to be playing in the last group with Pak.
	   ``I don't really mind being in the second group,'' Neumann said.
``Obviously, it is always fun to be in the last group, but I think
it could be kind of good for me. You sort of feel a little less
pressure. You are maybe playing a little more aggressive being
behind.''
	   Chuasiriporn took fifth at the NCAA championships at Madison in
May.
	   Pak stayed atop the leaderboard despite shooting a 75 Saturday,
when the field's' average was 77.89. She was at 1-over 214 after 54
holes. McKay and two others shot 73s. Not since the final round in
1976 had every golfer shot over par at a Women's Open.
	   The 6,412-yard (5,860-meter) layout is the second-longest in the
53 editions of the Women's Open. And swirling gusts off Lake
Michigan blew drives off course, scattered approach shots and left
everybody above par Saturday.
	   ``This golf course is tough enough and unforgiving enough, and
then when you add the wind, it's almost impossible,'' said Tammie
Green, who began the day tied for fifth, six shots back.
	   Annika Sorenstam, the 1995 and '97 Open winner who came to
Wisconsin riding consecutive victories on the tour, shot a 77
Sunday to finish at 18-over 302.

Detention extended for Jewish settler accused of attack on Arabs

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Vandals burned down several Palestinian fruit
stalls in the West Bank city of Hebron on Sunday, and a court
extended the detention of a 19-year-old Jew suspected of
vandalizing Arab-owned cars there.
	   Israeli and Palestinian leaders, meanwhile, continued to trade
blame over
	   last week's standoff in the Gaza Strip.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused the Palestinians of
threatening
	   violence every time a dispute arises, which he called ``the
opposite of peace and ... intolerable.''
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, returning from a summit in
Cairo on the
	   stalled peace process, called Netanyahu's threats of retribution
``meaningless.''
	   Netanyahu came under criticism from right-wing ministers in his
own Cabinet for backing down and allowing a Palestinian convoy to
use an Israeli-controlled road in Gaza after Israeli and
Palestinian troops confronted each other with cocked assault rifles
and armored personnel carriers. Israeli troops blocked Palestinian
traffic and Palestinian truckers blockaded Jewish settlements
during the confrontation, which began when Israeli troops stopped
the Palestinian convoy.
	   Israel Radio said Netanyahu told the Cabinet the decision to
allow the convoy to pass had been made without his knowledge, and
that he opposed the move. Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said
he gave the order to allow the convoy through, the radio said, but
added that the road is now closed to Palestinian traffic.
	   Netanyahu told reporters he stood by the army's decision.
	   The army said top security officials from both sides had met and
agreed to work on maintaining calm in the area, while acknowledging
that the next time forces come head to head, bloodshed might not be
avoidable.
	   Mohammed Dahlan, a senior Palestinian security official, warned
that this
	   latest confrontation had brought tensions in the Gaza Strip to a
boiling point.
	   ``This could lead to an explosion at any time,'' Dahlan said.
``I believe things could explode not necessarily for political
reasons but due to the actions of one ignorant soldier.''
	   Jewish settlers living in Gaza said they would physically block
Palestinian traffic if Palestinians were allowed into
Israeli-controlled areas in the future.
	   Earlier Sunday, the Magistrates Court extended the detention of
Nathaniel
	   Nir, 19, suspected of vandalizing Arab cars in Hebron, by five
days. Two other young men suspected of involvement in the Friday
night vandalism spree have yet to be caught, Israeli police
spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said.
	   The three Israelis, riding horses and disguised as Arabs, are
suspected of shattering the windshields and denting cars parked
near the Jewish settlement Kiryat Arba, on the outskirts of Hebron.
	   In a separate incident, at least four Palestinian fruit stalls
were burned down early Sunday morning in Hebron. One stall owner,
Adbel Samad Abu Sneineh, said he saw four Jewish settlers running
from the scene.
	   ``This is a brutal action and I demand protection for myself and
others from these settlers,'' Abu Sneineh said.
	   Menuhin said police were investigating the incident.
	   About 500 Jewish settlers live in downtown Hebron, in the midst
of 130,000 Palestinians. Relations between the two communities are
tense and from time to time there are outbreaks of violence.
	   Most of the city is controlled by the Palestinian Authority, but
the Israeli army and police control the Jewish enclaves and Arab
neighborhoods close to them.

Brazil's World Cup team spends more than it earns at World Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Although Brazil's national soccer
team will earn nearly dlrs 5 million in revenues during its World
Cup appearances, it will spend twice that much in its quest for an
unprecedented fifth world title, a newspaper reported Sunday.
	   Brazil, which meets Holland on Tuesday in a do-or-die semi-final
match, will earn dlrs 4.9 million, or dlrs 700,000 for each of its
seven matches, said the O Estado de Sao Paulo newspaper.
	   Yet those multi-million dollar earnings are not enough to cover
its expenses. ``It's the type of loss that all Brazilians would
like to have,'' Ricardo Teixeira, president of the Brazilian
Football Confederation (CBF) told the newspaper.
	   Teixeira estimates that when the World Cup ends on July 12, the
CBF will have spent dlrs 10 million. The team's month long hotel
bill alone is dlrs 1.2 million, and each player has been promised a
cash prize of dlrs 170,000 if Brazil goes all the way.
	   Yet Brazil's dream team has few worries regarding finances. The
CBF signed a 10-year dlrs 400 million contract with Nike, the
tennis shoe giant. Nike officials call it the biggest sports
marketing contract ever signed.
	   Moreover, the CBF is expected to hike its fee from dlrs 200,000
to dlrs 500,000 for `friendly'' matches against other nations -- if
Brazil wins the Cup, the newspaper reported.

Holbrooke returns to meet Milosevic, praises Rugova
</HEADLINE>

legislator graf 12.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. and Russian envoys urged ethnic
Albanian politicians Sunday to rally behind moderate leader Ibrahim
Rugova, insisting he is the best choice to speak for Kosovo's
Albanian majority in future talks with the Yugoslav government.
	   U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister
Nikolai Afanasyevsky drove that message home during talks
throughout the day with Rugova and representatives of all 16
Albanian political parties.
	   Absent from the meetings were representatives of the militant
Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for independence from
Serbia, the dominant republic in what remains of Yugoslavia.
	   Holbrooke, who has been shuttling between Pristina and the
Yugoslav capital Belgrade since Friday, is trying to persuade all
Albanian factions _ including the KLA _ to accept Rugova's
leadership.
	   The KLA has so far refused, and it was unclear whether
Holbrooke's latest effort had narrowed the differences within the
factious Albanian community.
	   ``We have continued extensive dialogue all day long with Dr.
Rugova and other political leaders,'' Holbrooke said before
returning to Belgrade. ``Dr. Rugova himself is going to continue to
seek a broader base for his goal, which is a negotiated peaceful
settlement to the Kosovo problem.''
	   Afanasyevsky also urged support for Rugova and repeated Moscow's
refusal to negotiate directly with the KLA _ which Russia and
Belgrade consider a terrorist group.
	   Standing alongside Holbrooke and Rugova, Afanasyevsky ``we came
to Pristina today to say to Mr. Rugova and his team that we support
them as we support their peaceful platform. We think that we must
act swiftly and energetically.''
	   The U.S. and Russian mediators are encouraging the Albanians to
overcome their differences and speak with a single voice in
negotiations with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic over the
future of the province.
	   Milosevic has expressed willingness to restore autonomy he
canceled in 1989. Vojislav Zivkovic, a member of Milosevic's party
told state-run Radio Belgrade Sunday that ``Serbia is ready for a
dialogue to solve the Kosovo problem'' on the condition it doesn't
harm Serbs living in the province.
	   But Rugova and others are demanding full independence.
Nevertheless, Rugova is considered a more acceptable negotiating
partner because he opposes violence.
	   The Serb crackdown, which has claimed hundreds of lives since
late February, has undercut Rugova's moderate appeal. The German
news magazine Spiegel quoted self-styled KLA spokesman Jakub
Krasniqi as saying his organization would never accept Rugova as a
leader because non-violence had failed to gain independence or halt
the crackdown.
	   The Serb Media Center reported ethnic Albanian militants
attacked Serb police and Serb villagers in two separate incidents
in northwest Kosovo Sunday. Militants also kidnapped three Serb
civilians late Saturday from villages southwest of Pristina, the
center said.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to Rugova, claimed that
fighting had flared up again in a strategic mining region that saw
heavy fighting last week. It was not possible to confirm the
reports.
	   As part of the diplomatic effort to curb the crisis,
Belgrade-based diplomats from the United States, Russia, Poland and
the European Union are to visit flashpoints in Kosovo on Monday.
	   Milosevic approved the visits last month under an agreement with
Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who wants to discourage NATO
military action against Serb forces.
	   Rugova urged Kosovo Albanians to cooperate with the observer
mission.

Brush fire ravishes nature reserve in the Golan Heights
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A brush fire ravished a nature reserve in the
Golan Heights Sunday, destroying hundreds of acres of natural
forests and endangering wildlife in the area, fire fighters said.
	   The blaze in the Nahal Ha'Shuah nature reserve broke out after a
small fire set by a local farmer on his property lost control, said
Dani Hanina, commander of the Golan Heights fire department.
	   Hanina said that although the fire was still not under control,
no local settlements were in danger.
	   Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria during the 1967
Middle East War.

Iraq and Jordan sign oil, pipeline agreement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq and Jordan signed an agreement Sunday
to build an oil pipeline between the two countries and to maintain
oil exports from Baghdad to Jordan.
	   The oil will be sold at half of market value, in keeping with
previous agreements.
	   ``There is no change either in the conditions or in the prices
for the second half of this year,'' said Iraqi Oil Minister Lt.
Gen. Amer Mohammed Rashid.
	   The oil pipeline would replace the fleet of more than 3,000
tankers that now ferry Iraqi crude to Jordan. Jordan says it pays
dlrs 50 million a year in transportation fees.
	   Rashid gave no date for the building of the pipeline.
	   Iraq has been under U.N. trade sanctions since its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait. The sanctions bar Iraqi oil exports except for limited
sales whose proceeds must be used to purchase food, medicine and
other humanitarian goods.
	   Jordan, which depends entirely on Iraq for oil, imports Iraqi
oil under a special U.N. permit that bypasses the sanctions.
	   Iraq agreed in December to increase its annual oil sales to
Jordan from 30.66 million barrels in 1997 to 35.04 million barrels
this year.

Queen to hire royal train to the right people to save money
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RETRANSMITTING to add cycle designator &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Queen Elizabeth II, as part of a drive to cut down
on the royals' 17.3 million pound (dlrs 28.5 million) annual travel
costs, is to hire out the royal train, _ but only to
``appropriate'' people, Buckingham Palace said Sunday.
	   ``There will be the opportunity for appropriate organizations to
use the royal train,'' said a palace spokeswoman. ``Each case will
be treated on its own merits.''
	   And that was as far as the spokeswoman, speaking on condition of
anonymity, would go _ declining to specify who would qualify as the
right type to rent the royal train with its maroon cars, dining
room and servants' quarters. Nor was there any word of the cost.
	   However, big businesses were expected to be among the first
customers.
	   The announcement followed the publication June 30 of the first
annual report on royal travel, showing the queen had saved 2
million pounds (dlrs 3.3 million) over the year ending March,
nearly half of it by cutting back on use of the royal train.
	   It costs some 10,000 pounds (dlrs 16,500) each time the queen
takes a journey.
	   The report showed the royals getting serious about
belt-tightening. Prince Philip, 77, the queen's husband, and her
sister Princess Margaret, 67, each took journeys on regular trains
using concession tickets for senior citizens.
	   The queen has already let some outsiders on board the royal
train. Wives of the heads of Group of Eight leading industrialized
nations traveled in it to visit the prime minister's country
residence during a summit meeting in May in the central England
city of Birmingham.
	   The royal travel report was part of drive by the royals to seem
less remote, more open, and less expensive.

	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Mark Crear of the United States beat
1996 Olympic and 1997 World Champion Allen Johnson Sunday in the
110-meter hurdles event at the IAAF track meet in Budapest Sunday.
	   Crear, who placed second in the Atlanta Olympics behind Johnson,
proved that this year he is in better form than his rival, by
clocking 13.28 seconds, 0.03 seconds ahead of Johnson. Tony Jarrett
of England came in third, another 0.17 seconds behind.
	   Another Atlanta Olympic champion, Balazs Kiss of Hungary,
suffered a defeat in hammer in front of the home crowd. Kiss won
this event in Budapest last year but this time, he placed only
third, behind Vasily Sidorenko of Russia, and Igor Astapkovich of
Belarus, the leader of this year's world rankings.
	   The men's hammer and women's discus were Grand Prix events at
this competition at the request of the International Amateur
Athletics Federation. However, while the hammer field included nine
of the world's top thirteen athletes, none of the important names
in women's discus showed up.
	   In the women's 400-meter hurdles, Judit Szekeres of Hungary, who
leads the European rankings this year, lost to Ionela Tirlea of
Romania who clocked 55.64 seconds, winning by 0.18 seconds ahead of
Szekeres. The time was not her best. Michelle Johnson of the United
States finished third, another 0.62 seconds behind.

 &UR; Politicians call for tougher border checks to prevent flood of
refugees &QL;

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ With continued fighting over a Serb
crackdown on restive ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, calls stepped up
Sunday in Germany for more border controls to prevent a new flood
of refugees into Europe.
	   The Hamburg-based Bild am Sonntag reported that Berlin Mayor
Eberhard Diepgen had sent a letter to Interior Minister Manfred
Kanther asking for sharper border controls within the EU, but
especially between German and Austria.
	   The report quoted Diepgen as saying that Berlin has already
exhausted its facilities, with 20,000 refugees from Bosnia still
sheltered in the city. Germany took in some 350,000 refugees during
Bosnia's 3 1/2 year war and many remain.
	   ``I must decisively decline to accept any additional refugees,''
the report quoted Diepgen as saying.
	   A German foreign ministry statement on Thursday said there is
concern because some 150,000 ethnic Albanians from Kosovo who were
to be returned to their homeland currently are in Germany, with an
additional 1,000 to 2,000 arriving monthly.
	   In a Sunday interview with Berlin radio station 100.6, Austrian
Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel, the current president of the
EU council of foreign ministries, said he wanted to start an
initiative to bring new order to the refugee situation in the
European Union.
	   It can't go on that Germany and Austria bear the main burden for
accepting civil war refugees and asylum seekers, Schuessel told the
station.
	   Schuessel warned western nations against publicly discussing
controversial positions on how to deal with the situation in
Kosovo, saying it sends the wrong signal to the Serbs.
	   He said it should be made clear to the Serbs that in an
emergency military force could be used to reach a solution in
Kosovo, but only with Russia. ``Without the Russians nothing goes
in the U.N. Security Council.''
	   Hundreds of people have died in Kosovo since Serb forces stepped
up efforts to crush militant resistance in February.
	   Ethnic Albanian separatists want independence for Kosovo, a
province in southern Serbia where Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1.
	   While NATO has indicated it might take military action to stop
the trouble in Kosovo from spreading, Russia has warned that it
will not accept such a move against the Serbs.

Detention extended for Jewish settler accused of attack on Arabs

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Vandals burned down several Palestinian fruit
stalls in the West Bank city of Hebron on Sunday, and a court
extended the detention of a 19-year-old Jew suspected of
vandalizing Arab-owned cars there.
	   Israeli and Palestinian leaders, meanwhile, continued to trade
blame over last week's standoff in the Gaza Strip.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused the Palestinians of
threatening violence every time a dispute arises, which he called
``the opposite of peace and ... intolerable.''
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, returning from a summit in
Cairo on the stalled peace process, called Netanyahu's threats of
retribution ``meaningless.''
	   Netanyahu came under criticism from right-wing ministers in his
own Cabinet for backing down and allowing a Palestinian convoy to
use an Israeli-controlled road in Gaza after Israeli and
Palestinian troops confronted each other with cocked assault rifles
and armored personnel carriers. Israeli troops blocked Palestinian
traffic and Palestinian truckers blockaded Jewish settlements
during the confrontation, which began when Israeli troops stopped
the Palestinian convoy.
	   Israel Radio said Netanyahu told the Cabinet the decision to
allow the convoy to pass had been made without his knowledge, and
that he opposed the move. Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said
he gave the order to allow the convoy through, the radio said, but
added that the road is now closed to Palestinian traffic.
	   According to Israeli media reports, Netanyahu had given
differing accounts of the event to cabinet members, telling some
that he supported the decision and others that he opposed it.
	   In an attempt to diffuse the criticism over his handling of the
confrontation, Netanyahu told reporters he stood by the army's
decision.
	   The army said top security officials from both sides had met and
agreed to work on maintaining calm in the area, while acknowledging
that the next time forces come head to head, bloodshed might not be
avoidable.
	   Mohammed Dahlan, a senior Palestinian security official, warned
that this latest confrontation had brought tensions in the Gaza
Strip to a boiling point.
	   ``This could lead to an explosion at any time,'' Dahlan said.
``I believe things could explode not necessarily for political
reasons but due to the actions of one ignorant soldier.''
	   Jewish settlers living in Gaza said they would physically block
Palestinian traffic if Palestinians were allowed into
Israeli-controlled areas in the future.
	   Earlier Sunday, the Magistrates Court extended the detention of
Nathaniel Nir, 19, suspected of vandalizing Arab cars in Hebron, by
five days. Two other young men suspected of involvement in the
Friday night vandalism spree have yet to be caught, Israeli police
spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said.
	   The three Israelis, riding horses and disguised as Arabs, are
suspected of shattering the windshields and denting cars parked
near the Jewish settlement Kiryat Arba, on the outskirts of Hebron.
	   In a separate incident, at least four Palestinian fruit stalls
were burned down early Sunday morning in Hebron. One stall owner,
Adbel Samad Abu Sneineh, said he saw four Jewish settlers running
from the scene.
	   ``This is a brutal action and I demand protection for myself and
others from these settlers,'' Abu Sneineh said.
	   Menuhin said police were investigating the incident.
	   About 500 Jewish settlers live in downtown Hebron, in the midst
of 130,000 Palestinians. Relations between the two communities are
tense and from time to time there are outbreaks of violence.
	   Most of the city is controlled by the Palestinian Authority, but
the Israeli army and police control the Jewish enclaves and Arab
neighborhoods close to them.

Iraq and Jordan sign oil, pipeline agreement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq and Jordan signed an agreement Sunday
to build an oil pipeline between the two countries and to maintain
oil exports from Baghdad to Jordan.
	   The oil will be sold at half of market value, in keeping with
previous agreements.
	   ``There is no change either in the conditions or in the prices
for the second half of this year,'' said Iraqi Oil Minister Lt.
Gen. Amer Mohammed Rashid.
	   The oil pipeline would replace the fleet of more than 3,000
tankers that now ferry Iraqi crude to Jordan. Jordan says it pays
dlrs 50 million a year in transportation fees.
	   Rashid gave no date for building the pipeline.
	   Iraq has been under U.N. trade sanctions since its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait. The sanctions bar Iraqi oil exports except for limited
sales to raise funds for humanitarian goods.
	   Jordan, which depends entirely on Iraq for oil, imports Iraqi
oil under a special U.N. permit that bypasses the sanctions.
	   Iraq agreed in December to increase its annual oil sales to
Jordan from 30.66 million barrels in 1997 to 35.04 million barrels
this year.

Puerto Rico braces for general strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Airports, utilities and government
agencies began bracing Sunday for a two-day general strike to
protest privatization of the Puerto Rico Telephone Co.
	   Workers on the government-run ferries that connect Puerto Rico
to the smaller islands of Culebra and Vieques told passengers that
they would not show up to work on Tuesday and Wednesday, and both
the power and water utilities warned customers they would be
operating on skeleton crews.
	   About 4,000 airport workers also vowed to walk off the job,
prompting the Caribbean airline LIAT to cancel its flights during
those two days, the San Juan Star reported.
	   ``We are going to paralyze our workplaces,'' said Oscar Valdez,
president of the Independent Union of Airport Employees. Taxi
drivers pledged to stop working, and teachers promised to join
striking telephone workers on the picket lines.
	   Telephone workers struck June 18 to protest the dlrs 1.9 billion
sale of the telephone utility to a consortium led by U.S.
communications giant GTE. Bombings, sabotage and clashes with
police followed Gov. Pedro Rossello's signing of the bill
authorizing the sale.
	   With some 7,900 workers, the telephone company would be Puerto
Rico's largest private employer after the sale. Employees fear
massive layoffs.
	   On Sunday, many residents of San Juan bought bags of ice and
filled bathtubs with water, worried that power lines might be
sabotaged and cause refrigerators and water pumping stations to
fail.

	   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Northern Ireland's
long-dominant Protestant brotherhood launched a dangerous ``battle
of wills'' Sunday with British security forces barring them from
this town's main Catholic neighborhood.
	   By nightfall, more than eight hours after some 1,000 Portadown
Orangemen dug in for a long standoff at a barricade blocking their
intended parade route down this town's predominantly Catholic
Garvaghy Road, sporadic violence broke out in Protestant areas of
the capital, Belfast, and several other towns.
	   Protestants took to the streets in sympathy, setting up burning
road blocks and milling about. Police said protesters blocked minor
roads with burning tires and debris, and a gasoline bomb was thrown
and cars stoned in Skegoniel, north Belfast. No arrests or injuries
were reported in the capital.
	   Road blocks were also thrown up in smaller towns, including
Lisburn, Carrickfergus, Ballyclare and Millisle, a coastal village,
the British news agency, Press Association, reported .
	   ``There are lots of groups on the streets in loyalist
(Protestant) areas of Belfast, but there is no evidence of major
disorder,'' said a spokesman at the Royal Ulster Constabulary
headquarters in Belfast, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Many
minor streets are blocked but all main roads remain open.'g`u up to barbed wire, cement blocks and a 15-foot (5 meter)
iron wall.
	   ``I can assure her majesty's government that we will be staying
here until such time as we are allowed our legitimate right to walk
the road,'' said Portadown's senior Orangeman, Harold Gracey.
	   Some four hours later, two men broke from the crowd, wiggled
through an outer ring of barbed wire to cheers from onlookers, and
were hauled off by riot police. Both were arrested, police said.
	   Some 60 Protestant women and children carrying Ulster banners
marched in protest to the British army headquarters.
	   Police chief Ronnie Flanagan insisted, however, that he would
enforce a decision by the government-appointed Parades Commission
barring the Orange parade from the Garvaghy Road, where militant
Catholics have organized opposition to the march for the past three
summers.

Morrison sets new seasonal record in 100-meter hurdles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LINZ, Austria (AP) _ Melissa Morrison of the United States broke
her own 1998 seasonal record by six-hundredths of a second, winning
the 100-meter hurdle event at the Zipfer Grand Prix IAAF track meet
Sunday.
	   Russian Svetlana Masterkova ran the mile in 4.32 seconds,
setting the second record for the season.
	   Other highlights of the night included Cuban triple-jumper Ivan
Pedroso's 8.42 meter jump and Dimitri Markov of Belarussia's 5.8
meter javelin.
	   Colin Jackson of Britain lost the 110-meter hurdle contest to
Reggie Trian of the United States, who clocked 13.17, by a fraction
of a second.
	   ``It's never nice to lose,'' said Jackson, who ran 13.18, after
the meet.
	   Local Stephanie Graf lost the 800-meter race by 00.24 of a
second to Surinam's Laetitia Vriesde who ran 2:00.68.
	   Hopes of a new world record in the women's pole vault were
dashed with Daniela Bartova of the Czech Republic and Australian
Emma George tied with 4.20 meters each.
	   Despite the big names and impressive times, the mood was low in
Linz, due to unseasonably cold weather and only 3,000 spectators
came out to watch.
	   On Thursday Morrison will try again to break her own record when
she runs in Olso, Norway's Golden League Series.

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Hundreds of Mexican academics, writers and
rights activists published an open letter to President Ernesto
Zedillo Sunday asking him to stop ``playing with fire'' in
government attacks on rebel sympathizers in the southern state of
Chiapas.
	   In a paid, full-page advertisement in Mexico's major newspapers,
755 academics _ including some well-known writers, artists and
actors _ said current policies would cause further violence in the
state.
	   ``Recent events in Chiapas show that people are playing with
fire. We believe that if this attitude continues, it will only
serve to ignite the whole country,'' the letter said.
	   The letter appeared to be referring to four raids this year by
heavily armed police and soldiers aimed at breaking up maverick
village councils sympathetic to Zapatista rebels.
	   The latest raid, a June 10 sweep by soldiers and state police in
the El Bosque township, led to a shootout in which 10 Indian
villagers and two policemen died.
	   Chiapas and federal government officials have defended the
raids, saying the maverick town councils are illegal and
provocative. The state governor has refused to rule out further
raids, but said none are currently scheduled.
	   Leftist Zapatista rebels staged a brief armed uprising in Mexico
in January 1994, demanding greater democracy and Indian rights.
peace talks between the rebels and the government have been stalled
for almost two years.
	   ___
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Taking steps to guard against
chemical and germ warfare, the military is building two labs to
help Brazil prepare for such attacks by terrorists or other
nations, a newspaper reported Sunday.
	   A center in the state of Rio de Janeiro will analyze lethal
chemicals such as sarin, a nerve gas that killed 12 in a 1995
terrorist attack in the Tokyo subway, said the paper O Globo.
	   The paper said another center in the Amazon port of Manaus will
study viruses and bacteria found in the region's rainforests.
Brazilian scientists say they have identified 186 Amazon viruses of
which 34 can provoke such maladies as high fevers, nausea and
anorexia. These specialists have long argued that much bacteria
found in the Amazon has not been adequately studied.
	   The army said it has no plan to use the labs to develop chemical
or biological weapons.
	   ``The aim is to detect, protect and decontaminate,'' Gen.
Tarciso Alves da Rocha, director of the army's Institute of Special
Projects, told the newspaper.
	   Brazil is one of 149 countries that have signed the Chemical
Weapons Convention, an international treaty that bans the
production, sale and use of chemical weapons.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A strong earthquake briefly cut power Sunday
to parts of the resort city of Acapulco, but there were no reports
of injury or serious damage, officials said.
	   The magnitude 5.2 temblor struck at 2:55 p.m. (1955 GMT) and was
centered about five miles (8 kms) off Acapulco's coast in the
Pacific Ocean, the National Seismological Center in Mexico City
said.

Two 20-year-olds force Monday playoff at Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with completion of play. &QL; 
 &UR; By ARNIE STAPLETON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KOHLER, Wisconsin (AP) _ Jenny Chuasiriporn's 30-foot (10-meter)
putt for birdie on No. 18 and Se Ri Pak's missed six-footer for
birdie on the same hole Sunday forced an 18-hole playoff between
the 20-year-olds at the 53rd U.S. Women's Open.
	   After Chuasiriporn's dramatic putt brought her into a tie for
the lead at six over for the tournament, Pak, playing in the next,
and final, twosome, missed hers, setting up the playoff.
	   They will tee off Monday morning for another 18 holes on the
unforgiving Blackwolf Run Golf Course, where only one golfer has
broken par since Friday.
	   Pak, who began the day with a one-stroke lead, finished with a
5-over 76 for a 6-over 290 for 72 holes. Chuasiriporn, who had a
closing 72, started the round four strokes back, tied for fourth.
	   Chuasiriporn, who will be a senior at Duke next fall, took fifth
at the NCAA championships at Madison two months ago. She will try
to become the first amateur to win an Open since Catherine LaCorte
in 1967. Her 72-hole total is the lowest ever for an amateur in an
Open.
	   Pak, who won the LPGA Championship in May, seeks to become the
first rookie to win two majors since Juli Inkster captured the
Nabisco Dinah Shore and du Maurier Ltd. Classic in 1984. The last
woman to win consecutive majors was Meg Mallon in 1991.
	   The drama at 18 capped an unbelievable round in which Pak,
Chuasiriporn and several others, including Mhairi McKay, Liselotte
Neumann, Chris Johnson and Pat Hurst all had a shot at winning the
tournament.
	   When her improbable birdie putt on 18 fell, Chuasiriporn put her
left hand over her mouth in amazement, then double high-fived her
caddy and brother, Joey.
	   ``Just incredible,'' Chuasiriporn said moments later. ``Wow.''
	   And she couldn't have been more shocked when the unflappable
Pak, who had seemed impervious to pressure through 71 holes, missed
her short putt for par by about two inches.
	   ``I (gave it) my best one,'' Pak said with a shrug. ``I just
play my game, I'm really happy.''
	   Neumann parred 18 for a 76 and finished one shot out of the
playoff, which will begin at 11 a.m. CDT (1500 GMT) Monday.
	   Danielle Ammaccapane, who began the round seven strokes back,
shot an even-par 71 to finish at 8-over 292, along with Hurst and
Johnson.
	   Chuasiriporn also was the low amateur at last year's Open in
Pumpkin Ridge in Oregon _ but that was a tie for 56th. LaCorte is
the only amateur ever to win the biggest event in women's golf.

	   The last playoff at the Open was in 1992, when Patty Sheehan
defeated Inkster by two strokes at Oakmont, Pennsylvania.
	   Pak began the final round Sunday with a one-stroke lead over
McKay and Neumann but she carded three bogeys and a double-bogey on
the front nine, and the steady Chuasiriporn took the lead with an
even-par 35 at the turn.
	   McKay, a 23-year-old from Scotland who was trying to become the
first golfer to win the Open on her first attempt since Kathy
Cornelius in 1956, took the lead at three over early on the front
nine.
	   But her triple-bogey on No. 7, where it took her three shots to
escape a bunker, and a bogey on No. 8, took her out of contention.
	   Pak's birdie on 14 tied her with Chuasiriporn, who then bogeyed
15 and 17 to fall two shots back.
	   As she was waiting to putt on 18, Pak's bogey on the par-3 17th
was posted on the leaderboard and suddenly, Chuasiriporn was
putting from 30 feet (10 meters) for a share of the lead.
	   Although the weather proved more accommodating than it did for
Saturday's ghastly round in the wind, pin placements remained
difficult and the pressure only intensified for the challengers.
	   Pak stayed atop the leaderboard despite shooting a 75 Saturday,
when the field's' average was 77.89. She was at 1-over 214 after 54
holes. McKay and two others shot 73s. Not since the final round in
1976 had every golfer shot over par at a Women's Open.
	   The 6,412-yard (5,860-meter) layout is the second-longest in the
53 editions of the Women's Open. And swirling gusts off Lake
Michigan blew drives off course, scattered approach shots and left
everybody above par Saturday.
	   ``This golf course is tough enough and unforgiving enough, and
then when you add the wind, it's almost impossible,'' said Tammie
Green, who began the day six shots back and finished with a 73 for
a 293 total.
	   Annika Sorenstam, the 1995 and '97 Open winner who came to
Wisconsin riding consecutive victories on the LPGA tour, shot a 77
Sunday to finish at 18-over 302.
	   ``I'm glad this week is over,'' Sorenstam said. ``I really think
I played some good golf and I just didn't get rewarded this week.
That's the way it goes with golf sometimes.''

	   Neumann parred 18 for a 76 and finished one shot out of the
playoff, which will begin at 11 a.m. CDT (1500 GMT) Monday.
	   ``It was a disappointing day,'' Neumann said. ``I didn't get

Mexican activist: roller coaster tank unfair to whales
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK STEVENSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ An amusement park's placement of two beluga
whales in a tank under a roller coaster is cruel and detrimental to
the animals, a prominent environmentalist said Sunday.
	   The two white, male 7-foot-long (2.3-meter) belugas have been
held in a small 15-by-25-foot (4.5 by 8 meter) quarantine pool
since May, awaiting transfer to a larger 70-by-30 foot (21 by
9-meter) pool.
	   A transfer date has not yet been announced, and the second pool
is also located beneath the roller coaster at the private La Feria
park.
	   ``They're being submitted to noise levels of 70 decibels, which
is the highest maximum level permitted in hazardous workplaces
under Mexican labor law,'' said Homero Aridjis, the poet who heads
the environmentalist Group of 100.
	   In addition, he said the pollution and shallow size of the pools
_ about 25 feet (8 meters) deep, for a whale that normally dives to
3,000 feet (900 meters) or more _ amount to ``inhuman'' treatment
of the belugas.
	   The amusement park represents a big life-style change from the
silent, cold Arctic seas of Russia, where the belugas _ which can
grow to weigh as much as a ton _ were captured.
	   The animals, which have porpoise-like heads, whale-like bodies,
and communicate through a complex series of squeaks and whistles,
are doing well so far, park veterinarian Guillermo Rodriquez said.
	   ``We've monitored them, and they've adapted very well'' he said.
	   Rodriguez said the whales are part of an educational project
aimed at giving kids who visit the working-class park a chance to
see the belugas and study them.
	   The big challenge, Rodriguez says, is to keep the pool's water
temperature at Arctic levels in semi-tropical Mexico City. A
sun-screen tarp covers the pool and a refrigeration unit keeps
waters at an acceptable temperature of about 61 degrees (16 C).
	   Aridjis says the whales, actually members of the dolphin family,
should be in water closer to freezing temperatures.
	   Aridjis likened the case to the killer whale Keiko, which
developed a skin infection after being confined to a cramped pool
at another Mexico City amusement park. After a worldwide campaign,
Keiko was transferred to an Oregon aquarium 2 1/2 years ago, and
may be returned this fall to a floating tank in his native Iceland.
	   While the park prepares to launch a competition to name the two
belugas, Aridjis says they should be released.
	   ``The only names they should be given is Freedom I and Freedom
II,'' Ardijis said.

Pedroso's 8.42 meter jump and Dimitri Markov of Belarussia's 5.8
meter pole vault.
	   Colin Jackson of Britain lost the 110-meter hurdle contest to
Reggie Trian of the United States, who clocked 13.17, by a fraction
of a second.
	   ``It's never nice to lose,'' said Jackson, who ran 13.18, after
the meet.
	   Local Stephanie Graf lost the 800-meter race by 00.24 of a
second to Surinam's Laetitia Vriesde who ran 2:00.68.
	   Hopes of a new world record in the women's pole vault were
dashed with Daniela Bartova of the Czech Republic and Australian
Emma George tied with 4.20 meters each.
	   Despite the big names and impressive times, the mood was low in
Linz, due to unseasonably cold weather and only 3,000 spectators
came out to watch.
	   On Thursday Morrison will try again to break her own record when
she runs in Olso, Norway's Golden League Series.

	   LINZ, Austria (AP) _ Melissa Morrison of the United States broke
her own 1998 seasonal record by six-hundredths of a second, winning
the 100-meter hurdle event in 12.65 seconds at the Zipfer Grand
Prix IAAF track meet Sunday.
	   Russian Svetlana Masterkova ran the mile in 4 minutes 32
seconds, setting the second record for the season. World champion
Marion Jones of the United States set a stadium record, running the
100-meter event in 10.85 seconds.

U.S. policy on Cuba wrong, new Caribbean Community leader says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GUY ELLIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CASTRIES, St. Lucia (AP) _ In the trade group's boldest
criticism yet of U.S. policy toward Cuba, the Caribbean Community's
new chairman said the U.S.-backed embargo denies Cubans''a right to
live.''
	   ``We do not feel that Cuba should be penalized for its failure
to approach democracy at the dictate of any particular
government,'' said Kenny Anthony, prime minister of St. Lucia and
the new chairman of the 15-member group.
	   Anthony said the Caribbean Community would offer to help mediate
talks to improve relations between Cuba and the United States. He
made the comments following a summit of Caribbean leaders in St.
Lucia.
	   Caribbean nations have grown increasingly friendly to Cuba in
the last year, striking dozens of new economic development deals
with Fidel Castro's government and sending business and government
delegations to Havana.
	   ``All of these islands are in the process of building their own
democracies and they feel very strongly that economic measures
should not be used to deny people a right to live,'' Anthony said.
	   The United States has maintained an economic embargo of Cuba
since 1962 and has long pressured Caribbean allies to isolate the
communist island. Increasingly, those countries are ignoring U.S.
desires.
	   During a speech to summit participants on Saturday, South
African President Nelson Mandela called Castro ``one of the most
popular leaders in the developing world'' and a ``legend in his own
time.''
	   In a news release Sunday, Mandela endorsed Cuba for membership
in the African, Caribbean and Pacific trade group, a collection of
former European colonies that received trade benefits from the
European Union.

Browne chips in on playoff hole to win
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DONNA TOMMELLEO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CROMWELL, Connecticut (AP) _ Olin Browne made a 40-foot
(12-meter) chip-in birdie on the first playoff hole Sunday to beat
Larry Mize and defending champion Stewart Cink and win the Greater
Hartford Open, his first PGA Tour victory.
	   The playoff followed the stunning collapse of Mize, who had a
four-stroke lead going to the 15th hole after stringing together
birdies on Nos. 11-14 to stand at 18 under par.
	   But on the par-4, 296-yard (270-meter) 15th, he shanked a 5-iron
deep into the woods and, after several minutes of searching, found
his unplayable ball and had to tee it up again. He took a
double-bogey on that hole and missed a 1-foot (35-cms) par putt on
No. 16.
	   By the time he reached the final hole, the 1987 Masters champion
was clinging to a one-stroke lead over Browne and Cink. But his
approach shot rolled off the back of the green and his chip left
him with about a 15-foot (4.5-meter) putt that he narrowly missed
for par and a 1-under 69.
	   Despite his swoon, Mize maintained a bit of optimism as he,
Browne and Cink all set the GHO 72-hole scoring record of 14-under
266.
	   ``I've had a lot of good breaks in my time, and you know this
one didn't work out my way. But this week encourages me to just
keep working hard,'' Mize said.
	   Browne, who became the sixth first-time winner on tour this
year, finished with a 67 that was marked by four birdies and a
double-bogey on the 462-yard (422-meter) , par-4 10th. His birdie
at No. 16 put him 14 under and in contention for the playoff.
	   ``I had a good week and I played well all four days and I think
that's what it takes. You can't have a skittish round out here, the
guys are so good,'' he said.
	   Cink, who also shot a 67, was 13 under when he birdied the
signature 17th hole to reserve his spot for the playoff.
	   His approach shot on the 444-yard (405-meter), par-4 18th, which
was used as the playoff hole, rolled across the green and into the
left fringe about pin high. Mize reached the green in three and
could only watch at that point. Cink, bidding to become the first
repeat GHO winner, had an opportunity to tie but his 15-foot
(4.5-meter) birdie putt rolled wide.
	   Browne won dlrs 360,000 to increase his career earnings to dlrs
1,196,817.
	   A third-round co-leader, Mize began the day at 13 under, tied
with Scott Hoch and Grant Waite.
	   Duffy Waldorf and Fred Funk had final-round 66s and finished at
267, tied with Doug Tewell, who had a 67, and one shot out of the
playoff. Hoch had a 71 and finished tied with David Duval, who had
a 69, at 268. Waite shot a 75 and finished at 272.
	   Vijay Singh shot a 62 Sunday to tie the course record and finish
10 under. His 28 on the back nine broke the record of 29 set in
1995 by Fuzzy Zoeller and Mike Brisky. Singh's round included six
birdies and an eagle on the par-5 13th. He said he got his putter
going just in time for next week's British Open.
	   ``This is something good to take away with me and hopefully I
can just continue where I left off today,'' Singh said.

Mandela: permanent members of U.N. Security Council should
</HEADLINE>
surrender veto &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with proposal for South Africa-Caricom commission and
exchange programs. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By GUY ELLIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CASTRIES, St. Lucia (AP) _ South African President Nelson
Mandela urged developing countries to demand that the five
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council give up their veto
power.
	   Speaking Saturday night before a summit of the Caribbean
Community trade bloc on the island of St. Lucia, Mandela called for
the ``democratization'' of the United Nations and said it is unfair
that China, France, Russia, the United States and Britain can
override decisions by the 10 rotating members of the council.
	   The Security Council is responsible for maintaining peace and
stability among the 185 members of the United Nations.
	   Mandela said the issue would dominate a meeting of nonaligned
countries in South Africa in August. Nonaligned countries do not
belong to Western or Eastern military alliances.
	   Small Caribbean nations have grown increasingly frustrated with
larger countries as foreign aid drops and trade perks they enjoy
from Europe come under fire.
	   Eliminating the veto power would give them greater say, Mandela
said.
	   ``The fact that a country is small, both geographically and in
population, does not mean that it is unimportant,'' he said. ``What
is tragic is that a country should be small and coward.''
	   Mandela ended a three-day visit to the summit on Saturday. In a
news release Sunday, he suggested that South Africa and Caribbean
Community countries form a commission to further economic
development and technical cooperation.
	   The countries also agreed to begin an exchange program for
teachers and students.
	   Mandela apologized for not having met with the Caribbean
Community earlier. Cooperation with the Caribbean had been delayed,
he said ``in recent years, by the tumult of South Africa's entry
into the international community of free nations, and for decades
before that, by its oppression under the yoke of apartheid.''

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ David Cone became the second 12-game winner in
the American League as the New York Yankees matched the best
81-game start in major league history with a 1-0 victory over the
Baltimore Orioles on Sunday.
	   New York won its sixth straight, 10th in the last 11 games and
improved to 61-20 matching the record of the 1902 Pittsburgh
Pirates and the 1907 Chicago Cubs.
	   Cone (12-2) allowed seven hits in eight innings and struck out
four. He did not issue a walk for the third straight start. Mariano
Rivera got his 22nd save.
	   The Yankees scored the only run in the third when Scott Erickson
(8-7) hit Chad Curtis with the bases loaded.
 &UR; Blue Jays 2, Devil Rays 1 &QC; 
	   In Toronto, Roger Clemens struck out seven to become only the
11th pitcher to get 3,000 strikeouts as the host Blue Jays swept
the three-game series.
	   Clemens, who got a no-decision, allowed one run and five hits in
7 1-3 innings, leaving after allowing consecutive walks to Quinton
McCracken and Wade Boggs. He has 3,002 strikeouts in his career.
	   Tony Fernandez hit an RBI single in the eighth of Rock White
(1-4) to give the Blue Jays a 2-1 lead.
	   Paul Quantrill (1-3) got the win and Randy Myers pitched the
ninth for his 23rd save.
 &UR; Red Sox 15, White Sox 14 &QC; 
	   In Boston, John Valentin's RBI single broke a seventh-inning tie
and the Red Sox recovered after blowing an eight-run lead.
	   Troy O'Leary had four hits and Valentin, Mike Benjamin and
Darren Bragg each had three for Boston, which has scored 15 runs
three of its last four games.
	   Carlos Reyes (1-0) earned the victory, pitching a scoreless
seventh before putting two on with no out in the eighth. Tom Gordon
got his 25th save despite allowing a three-run homer to Wilfredo
Cordero in the eighth.
	   Bob Howry (0-1) took the loss, but the real damage was done by
Chicago starter Jaime Navarro, who allowed eight runs on nine hits
in two-plus innings.
 &UR; Indians 12, Royals 3 &QC; 
	   In Kansas City, Missouri, Manny Ramirez hit two home runs for
the second time in three days, including a grand slam in a six-run
sixth inning, to lead Cleveland.
	   All-Star first baseman Jim Thome and David Bell also homered and
Travis Fryman had four hits for the Indians.
	   Ramirez's 10th career two-homer game backed Cleveland starter
Jaret Wright, who was ejected in the seventh inning after throwing
a pitch over the head of Larry Sutton. Wright (8-5) allowed just
three hits and two runs in six-plus innings.
	   Glendon Rusch (6-10) took the loss.
 &UR; Twins 5, Tigers 4 &QC; 
	   In Minneapolis, LaTroy Hawkins struggled but won his first game
in three weeks, as host Minnesota salvaged the final game of their
three-game series.
	   Todd Walker hit his seventh homer off Brian Moehler (8-6) and
Ron Coomer drove in two runs for the Twins, who enter the All-Star
break in second place in the AL Central, 10 1/2 games behind
Cleveland.
	   Hawkins (5-8) allowed seven hits and four runs _ three earned _
in five innings, working out of a two-on, one-out jam in the fifth
to gain the win. Rick Aguilera pitched the ninth for his 18th
save.
 &UR; Athletics 5, Angels 4
	   In Anaheim, California, Kevin Mitchell homered in the eighth to
the game and walked with the bases loaded in the ninth to force in
the winning run as the Oakland Athletics beat the Anaheim Angels
5-4 Sunday.
	   Ryan Christenson led off the ninth with a double off Trop
Percival (1-3). After Rickey Henderson walked, Bournigal sacrificed
the runners to second and third. Percival intentionally walked Ben
Grieve, before walking Mitchell on a 3-2 pitch to score the winning
run.
	   It was the fourth straight win for Oakland, which swept the
Angels in Anaheim for the first time since 1991. The Angels have
lost five straight but head into the All-Star break atop the AL
West.
	   Mitchell had tied it at 4 when he led off the eighth with his
first homer of the year. Mitchell connected off Angels starter
Chuck Finley, ending his career-long stretch of 122 at-bats without
a homer.
	   Mike Fetters (1-2) pitched 1 2-3 scoreless innings for the
victory. Billy Taylor pitched the ninth for his 18th save.

Summerhays wins second senior title
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Summerhays winning; details of Sunday
competition. &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID GINSBURG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLUMBIA, Maryland (AP) _ Bruce Summerhays made a 20-foot (6
meter) birdie putt on the 18th hole Sunday to avert a three-way
playoff and win the inaugural State Farm Senior Classic.
	   Summerhays, who started the day three strokes off the pace, shot
a 69 for a 10-under-par 206 total. His second Senior PGA Tour
victory in 96 events earned him a career-best paycheck of dlrs
187,000.
	   Hale Irwin shot a 3-under 69 and finished in a second-place tie
with Walter Hall at 207. Irwin collected dlrs 100,000 to pass Greg
Norman and become the leading career money winner among PGA
players. He has amassed dlrs 12,030,109 over his professional golf
career.
	   Irwin went three under on the back nine, and for a while it
seemed as if his birdie on 18 would be good enough to get him into
a playoff. But Summerhays wouldn't let it happen.
	   ``I did not have the game I needed to really and truly
contend,'' Irwin said. ``I knew somebody would birdie the other
hole other than me.''
	   Summerhays, 54, became the 15th different tournament winner on
the Senior PGA Tour this year. His wild round included seven
birdies and four bogeys, but he saved the best for last _ his
dramatic putt on 18 enabled him to pull away from a logjam atop the
leaderboard that included a dozen golfers.
	   Hall made four birdies on the front nine and added another on 12
to go 10 under, but he bogeyed 13 and finished with five straight
pars.
	   ``I had some good chances today,'' Hall said. ``If I get into
the hunt again, maybe lightning will strike. I'll just keep
trying.''
	   Seven players finished eight under, including David Graham, the
co-leader with Tom Jenkins after the second round. Graham, who shot
a 74, missed several putts from under 10 feet and lost his share of
the lead on No. 16 when he sent an 8-foot (2.5-meter) birdie putt
past the cup and missed the 3-foot (1-meter) comebacker.
	   Graham started the round in horrid fashion, yanking his tee shot
on No. 1 under a tall pine tree to the right of the fairway. Using
a 5-iron and crouching, he hit the ball about 20 feet (6 meters )
and subsequently took a bogey to fall out of the lead.
	   He bogeyed No. 4 but rebounded with a birdie on the 507-yard
par-5 5th, blasting out of a bunker before sinking a 6-foot
(2-meter) putt. A 35-foot (10.5-meter) chip for a birdie on No. 8
put Graham in the lead, but his 3-foot (1-meter) par putt on No. 9
lipped the cup.
	   Jenkins, a senior rookie who led after the first round and
shared the lead after the second round with Graham at 10 under, was
four over on the front nine and finished with a 79.
	   Jenkins began his fade on No. 2 when he overshot the green and
chipped 15 feet (4.5-meters) past the hole en route to a bogey. He
missed a 2-footer (65 cms) for a bogey on 4 and took another bogey
on the following hole after he hooked his tee shot outside the cart
path and shanked his next shot.
	   Terry Dill, who began a stroke behind the co-leaders, birdied
Nos. 2 and 3 to take command at 11 under. But he had par putts lip
out of the cup on Nos. 5 and 6, then missed a 7-footer (2.3-meter)
on 8 for another bogey.
	   Dill shot a 73 to finish in the pack at 208 that included Jim
Albus, Leonard Thompson, Bob Duval, Dave Stockton and Hubert Green.

 &UR; ST. LUCIA: Mandela says members of Security Council should
surrender veto &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CASTRIES, St. Lucia (AP) _ South African President Nelson
Mandela urged developing countries to demand that the five
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council give up their veto
power.
	   Speaking Saturday night before a summit of the Caribbean
Community trade bloc on the island of St. Lucia, Mandela called for
the ``democratization'' of the United Nations and said it is unfair
that China, France, Russia, the United States and Britain can
override decisions by the 10 rotating members of the council.
	   The Security Council is responsible for maintaining peace and
stability among the 185 members of the United Nations.
	   Mandela said the issue would dominate a meeting of nonaligned
countries in South Africa in August. Nonaligned countries do not
belong to Western or Eastern military alliances.
 &UR; ST. LUCIA: U.S. policy on Cuba wrong, new Caricom leader says
	   CASTRIES, St. Lucia (AP) _ In the trade group's boldest
criticism yet of U.S. policy toward Cuba, the Caribbean Community's
new chairman said the U.S.-backed embargo denies Cubans ``a right
to live.''
	   ``We do not feel that Cuba should be penalized for its failure
to approach democracy at the dictate of any particular
government,'' said Kenny Anthony, prime minister of St. Lucia and
the new chairman of the 15-member group.
	   Anthony said the Caribbean Community would offer to help mediate
talks to improve relations between Cuba and the United States. He
made the comments following a summit of Caribbean leaders in St.
Lucia.
	   Caribbean nations have grown increasingly friendly to Cuba in
the last year, striking dozens of new economic development deals
with Fidel Castro's government and sending business and government
delegations to Havana.
	   ``All of these islands are in the process of building their own
democracies and they feel very strongly that economic measures
should not be used to deny people a right to live,'' Anthony said.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Government, residents brace for general strike
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Airports, utilities and government
agencies began bracing Sunday for a two-day general strike to
protest privatization of the Puerto Rico Telephone Co.
	   Workers on the government-run ferries that connect Puerto Rico
to the smaller islands of Culebra and Vieques told passengers that
they would not show up to work on Tuesday and Wednesday, and both
the power and water utilities warned customers they would be
operating on skeleton crews.
	   About 4,000 airport workers vowed to walk off the job, prompting
the Caribbean airline LIAT to cancel its flights during those two
days, the San Juan Star reported.
	   ``We are going to paralyze our workplaces,'' said Oscar Valdez,
president of the Independent Union of Airport Employees. Taxi
drivers pledged to stop working, and teachers promised to join
striking telephone workers on the picket lines.
 &UR; ST. LUCIA: Banana trade could divide U.S. and Caribbean, leader
warns
	   CASTRIES, St. Lucia (AP) _ U.S. relations with the Caribbean
could be ``severely compromised'' by challenges to the local banana
trade, the incoming head of the Caribbean Community trade bloc
warned Sunday.
	   Kenny Anthony, St. Lucia's prime minister and the group's new
leader, vowed to defend trade perks and price protections granted
by the European Union to its former colonies in the Caribbean. He
spoke during a summit of Caribbean leaders.
	   The United States and Latin American countries won a World Trade
Organization case last year declaring the trade benefits unfair.
U.S. officials have since rejected proposals for scaled-down
benefits packages.
	   The attitude has worried small countries in the southeast
Caribbean, known as the Windward Islands.
	   ``The U.S. continues to be reckless in its efforts to undermine
the viability of the banana industry in these islands,'' Anthony
said.
 &UR; UNITED STATES: Miami attorney linked to phony loan scheme in
Antigua
	   GAINESVILLE, Florida (AP) _ Prosecutors say a Miami lawyer
helped run a money-laundering scheme through Antigua that bilked
victims, including entertainer Dionne Warwick, out of some dlrs 63
million.
	   Jerrell E. Breslin allegedly lured hundreds of people into an
``advance fee'' scheme, in which people pay fees to individuals or
businesses that pledge to get loans for them from legitimate
lending institutions.
	   But the loan never materializes, and the intermediary keeps the
money.
	   The scheme allegedly lured hundreds of victims from across the
United States and did its banking in the Caribbean tourist stop of
Antigua.
	   Warwick lost dlrs 100,000 to the scheme in late 1995 and early
1996, court records show. She had tried to get money for a company
called the Dionne Warwick Design Group and needed to pay off an IRS
debt totaling dlrs 600,000.
	   The entertainer paid a dlrs 100,000 fee in exchange for a dlrs
2.5 million loan that never materialized.

Browne chips in on playoff hole to win

	   CROMWELL, Connecticut (AP) _ Olin Browne made a 40-foot
(12-meter) chip-in birdie on the first playoff hole Sunday to beat
Larry Mize and defending champion Stewart Cink and win the Greater
Hartford Open, his first PGA Tour victory.
	   The playoff followed the stunning collapse of Mize, who had a
four-stroke lead going to the 15th hole after stringing together
birdies on Nos. 11-14 to stand at 18 under par.
	   But on the par-4, 296-yard (270-meter) 15th, he shanked a 5-iron
deep into the woods and, after several minutes of searching, found
his unplayable ball and had to tee it up again. He took a
double-bogey on that hole and missed a 1-foot (35-cms) par putt on
No. 16.
	   By the time he reached the final hole, the 1987 Masters champion
was clinging to a one-stroke lead over Browne and Cink. But his
approach shot rolled off the back of the green and his chip left
him with about a 15-foot (4.5-meter) putt that he narrowly missed
for par and a 1-under 69.
	   Despite his swoon, Mize maintained a bit of optimism as he,
Browne and Cink all set the GHO 72-hole scoring record of 14-under
266.
	   ``I've had a lot of good breaks in my time, and you know this
one didn't work out my way. But this week encourages me to just
keep working hard,'' Mize said.
	   Browne, who became the sixth first-time winner on tour this
year, finished with a 67 that was marked by four birdies and a
double-bogey on the 462-yard (422-meter) , par-4 10th. His birdie
at No. 16 put him 14 under and in contention for the playoff.
	   ``I had a good week and I played well all four days and I think
that's what it takes. You can't have a skittish round out here, the
guys are so good,'' he said.
	   Cink, who also shot a 67, was 13 under when he birdied the
signature 17th hole to reserve his spot for the playoff.
	   Browne's approach shot on the 444-yard (405-meter), par-4 18th,
which was used as the playoff hole, rolled across the green and
into the left fringe about pin high. Mize reached the green in
three and could only watch at that point. Cink, bidding to become
the first repeat GHO winner, had an opportunity to tie but his
15-foot (4.5-meter) birdie putt rolled wide.
	    &UR; Browne won, 11th graf pvs

	   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Northern Ireland's

standoff at a barricade blocking their intended parade route
through a predominantly Catholic neighborhood, sporadic violence
broke out in Protestant areas of the capital, Belfast, and several
other towns.Protestants took to the streets in sympathy, setting up
burning road blocks and milling about. No arrests or injuries were
reported in the capital. (NORTHERN IRELAND)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. and Russian envoys urged
Kosovo's ethnic Albanian politicians Sunday to rally behind
moderate leader Ibrahim Rugova, insisting he is the best choice to
speak for the province's embattled Albanian majority. Richard
Holbrooke and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolai Afanasyevsky
drove that message home during talks throughout the day with Rugova
and representatives of all 16 ethnic Albanian political parties.
Absent from the meetings were representatives of the militant
Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for Kosovo's independence
from Serbia, the largest of two remaining republics in Yugoslavia.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The deadlock in Middle East peace talks and
an Israeli plan to extend Jerusalem's borders could ignite violence
that may prove unstoppable, President Hosni Mubarak warned Sunday.
Mubarak met King Hussein of Jordan and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat in a brief and hastily called summit amid warnings that
tension over the deadlock had reached dangerous levels. The three
leaders called on Israel to reverse a decision to extend
Jerusalem's municipal services to West Bank Jewish settlements. The
move has angered Palestinians, who accuse Israel of violating peace
accords by unilaterally making decisions on Jerusalem's future.
Israeli officials said the summit was a Palestinian attempt to put
pressure on Israel that would fail. (EGYPT-SUMMIT)
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Angry Berbers remained shuttered inside
their homes to protest a law that took effect Sunday making Arabic
the only official language in Algeria. In the capital Algiers,
police prevented Front of Socialist Forces, which opposed the law,
from holding a march. The demonstrators dispersed peacefully. The
introduction of the controversial law overshadowed the 36th
anniversary of Algeria's independence from France, which was also
marked on Sunday. The law bans from official use all languages
except Arabic, including French, which is widely used in this
former French colony in North Africa. Berbers, who make up a third
of the Algerian population and speak their own language, oppose the
law, which is considered by many as an attempt by the
military-backed government to win the support of Islamic movements.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Downtown Kai Tak airport, famous for its
roof-skimming approaches, ended 73 years of operation Monday in an
impromptu celebration by thousands of Hong Kong residents who towed
children and cameras along for a last, nostalgic look. Hours later,
after a massive, overnight move including trucks, barges and
planes, a gleaming new facility opened on reclaimed land at the
edge of an outlying island 30 kilometers (22 miles) away. The new
Chek Lap Kok airport's first flight was an inaugural non-stop
trans-polar flight by Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific airline from New
York, which arrived at 6:25 a.m., slightly ahead of schedule.
Fittingly, Kai Tak's last operations were a departure for Britain _
Hong Kong's former colonial ruler _ and an arrival from China _ the
new sovereign after Britain returned the territory to China last
year. (HONG KONG-AIRPORT)

Muslims celebrate religious freedom
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MAPLE, Ontario (AP) _ About 8,000 Ahmadiyya Muslims from around
the world gathered at a mosque to celebrate their right to
religious freedom in Canada.
	   ``In my country, people are prosecuted for their religious
beliefs,'' Mujib-ur-Rahman, a lawyer for Pakistan's Supreme Court,
told members Sunday at the finale of the weeklong convention. ``No
one has a right to superiority.''
	   The main purpose of the convention was for members to learn more
about their religion, said Naseem Mahdi, president of Canada's
Ahmadiyya Muslim community. The Ahmadiyya Muslim movement is one of
73 Muslim sects. It was founded in 1889 in India by a man followers
believe was a prophet from God.
	   ``In Islam we don't promote individualism,'' Mahdi said. ``We
promote sisterhood and brotherhood.''
	   The convention was broadcast worldwide via satellite on Muslim
television.
	   Ijaz Qamar, 60, who left many family members in Pakistan when he
moved to Canada about 25 years ago, said it saddens him to think
that his relatives are persecuted for beliefs he is free to express
in Canada.
	   ``It's not a good feeling that your near and dear ones don't
have freedom,'' he said, fighting back tears. ``This kind of
gathering cannot be held back home. It's banned.''

Modern-day rickshaw puller runs against tides of time in Japan

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Few people know the streets of Tokyo's swankiest
entertainment district, the Ginza, better than Hisa. Each day, he
ferries passengers through its crowded labyrinth of streets.
	   His clients are an exclusive bunch _ geishas mostly. And they
choose him because he knows the area not just by heart, but by
sole.
	   Hisa is one of Japan's last professional rickshaw runners,
spending his days and nights trodding through the fumes of diesel
trucks and the colorful glare of Tokyo's relentless neon.
	   His world is like a living time capsule, and he knows it could
soon be overrun by the frenetic pace of the rest of his countrymen.
	   But for now, in his little patch of the city, Hisa is still king
of the road.
	   ___
	   Rickshaw is a corruption of the Japanese word ``jinrikisha,''
which means man-powered carriage.
	   The two-wheeled vehicle is said to have been invented by three
Tokyo residents in 1869, just as Japan was emerging from feudal
rule and rushing to adopt Western ideas and technology. It was an
immediate hit.
	   As many as 50,000 were in use around the city in the later part
of the 19th century. The rickshaw was also Japan's first successful
export vehicle, becoming a familiar sight in many Asian cities.
	   Most rickshaws were used for short jaunts, but until the early
1900s, trips could even be taken from Tokyo to such distant
destinations as the ancient capital of Kyoto, some 370 kilometers
(230 miles) away.
	   Rickshaw drivers, called ``shafu,'' were known for distinctive
shouts that warned pedestrians on the dirt streets to stay clear.
	   It was a demanding job, and not everyone welcomed the drivers
with glowing praise. Some considered the shafu a symbol of
demeaning physical labor. Others simply didn't like seeing dirty,
sweaty men in loincloths running through the streets.
	   ``Dusty, bare-legged coolies,'' was how Mary Crawford, the wife
of a British diplomat stationed in Japan during the 1890s,
described the drivers in a book published at the turn of the
century.
	   ``The private jinrikisha may be a very dainty and luxurious
little affair,'' she wrote. ``But ... we ourselves always use
(horse-drawn) carriages.''
	   The rickshaw boom was short-lived. Rickshaws disappeared almost
entirely when the mass-produced automobile roared onto the scene in
the 1920s. Today, there are, at most, several dozen left in all of
Japan _ primarily catering to the tourist trade.
	   ___
	   Hisa's rickshaw has two thin, rubber-treaded wheels the size of
Hula Hoops. A pair of long poles, used for pulling, are attached to
the front of the steel frame. A canvas canopy arches over the seat
to shade the customer.
	   Many of the first rickshaws were painted in a ribald fashion and
some apparently depicted lewd scenes. Tokyo officials cracked down
by banning excessive decoration in 1872.
	   Most have since stuck with a simple black lacquering.
	   Early rickshaws also often seated two. Twice the fun for
passengers, but double the weight for rickshaw runners _ today,
one-seaters are the rule.
	   Inside Hisa's vehicle, a red velvet-covered cushion covers the
little seat. Headroom is limited, legroom nonexistent and a tiny
window on either side allows a discreet glimpse out, while
protecting the client's privacy.
	   ___
	   Hisa _ that's his trade name; he was born Koichi Momosei _ says
he stumbled on his line of work.
	   In 1985, he dropped out of a Tokyo graphic design school after
spotting a help wanted ad for a rickshaw driver in a specialty
magazine for job hunters. He rushed to apply, fearing the job might
already have been filled.
	   He was the only applicant.
	   The rickshaw trade is a bastion of tradition, and Hisa was at
first required to go through a stint as an apprentice until his
superiors felt he had learned the secrets of piloting the
35-kilogram (77-pound) vehicle.
	   When on duty, Hisa wears the split-toed shoes Japan's day
laborers have worn for centuries as well as a pair of tight-fitting
corduroy overalls.
	   After 13 years, he has a mental map of Ginza that's hard to
beat, and knows all the quickest routes to the best Japanese
restaurants, called ``ryotei,'' where his geisha clients do their
entertaining.
	   But Hisa is also proud of his technical skills.
	   ``Balance is more important than strength,'' he says, grabbing
hold of his rickshaw poles and pulling away from the curb on a
demonstration run.
	   Although he is no doubt a skillful shafu, Hisa's ride can still
get pretty rough.
	   ``My arms are the shock absorbers,'' he says.

<TEXT>
	   Camera-toting tourists are not welcome on Hisa's rickshaw.
	   Service is by appointment only, via a special phone number. Most
of his callers are the elegantly coiffured, cumbersomely attired
geishas who work in the Ginza or in another geisha haven, the
nearby Shinbashi district.
	   Accomplished geishas begin their apprenticeship as teen-agers,
entering a geisha house and learning the arts of traditional
dancing, singing and playing instruments such as the ``shamisen,''
a three-stringed, banjo-like lute.
	   Numbering about 80,000 in the 1920s, their ranks have fallen to
a few thousand. Many have been replaced by professional hostesses
in Western-style pubs.
	   A devoted coterie of geishas with ties to top restaurants still
makes a decent living from the trade by catering to business and
political leaders.
	   The cramped crawl space that serves as Hisa's office is provided
rent-free by a guild representing top geishas and the fancy
restaurants where they do their entertaining. His client list is
comprised of about 100 geishas, half of whom are regulars.
	   On a busy day, he carts his clients back and forth between
geisha houses and the ryotei, sprinting much of the way.
	   ``Within Ginza, I'm just as fast as a taxi,'' he boasts.
	   But often his carriage sits empty while he runs errands for
geisha by bicycle, dropping off a wig or a pair of theater tickets.
	   Once he was asked to dispose of a client's dead cat.
	   ___
	   Hisa's rates are on a par with the standard minimum taxi fare in
Tokyo _ 650 yen, or about dlrs 4.65.
	   ``We have to stay competitive,'' he says.
	   But business could be better.
	   An anemic economy the past several years has tightened corporate
budgets, and that has particularly hurt Japan's ``water trade'' _
night spots ranging from top-flight restaurants to raunchy bars
that depend heavily on a clientele of businessmen.
	   Scandals casting a bad light on the long-established custom of
wining and dining politicians and bureaucrats have also taken a
toll on entertainment spending.
	   Hisa's rickshaw cooperative, the Hiyoshi-Gumi, has not been
immune.
	   As recently as the mid-1980s, it had enough work for six
full-time pullers. Now, he says, many days pass slowly with just
Hisa and one colleague on the payroll.
	   With no appointments pending for the afternoon, Hisa holes up in
his tiny office, sitting on a narrow cot in front of a television
set.
	   ``I've had more time to catch up on reading and watch the
tube,'' he says.

Despite promises, waterway still threatens vast Brazilian wetlands

 &UR; By MICHAEL ASTOR
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   CORUMBA, Brazil (AP) _ Day after day, a dredger sucks sand off
the bottom of the Paraguay River along Brazil's far western border
and shoots it downstream in a muddy swirl.
	   It's just routine channel maintenance, operators say.
	   But environmentalists are skeptical. They fear the dredging is
part of an unspoken plan to sidestep ecological protests and build,
little by little, a commercial waterway that could doom the world's
largest wetlands and kill endangered birds and animals.
	   In March, the Brazilian government announced it was dropping
plans for the ``hidrovia,'' a long-sought shipping route into South
America's heartland that would cut through the vast Pantanal
wetlands, which are three times the size of the Florida Everglades.
	   Eduardo Martins, head of Brazil's Environmental Protection
Agency, said at the time that the hidrovia ``does not have much
strategic value and would put the Pantanal at risk.''
	   But as months have passed and dredging goes on, the cheering of
environmental activists has given way to dismay.
	   ``Our big fear is they've abandoned the mega-project only to
have it done in stages,'' says Alcides Faria, president of the
environmental group Ecology in Action. ``It's easier to do in
stages. It will just take longer to get it all done.''
	   Everything was ``mega'' about the hidrovia, a dlrs 2 billion,
five-nation project designed to open the center of the continent to
the Atlantic Ocean.
	   The original plan was to link the Paraguay and Parana rivers in
a 2,134-mile-long (3,442-kilometer) waterway stretching from
Caceres, in western Brazil, to the Uruguayan seaport of Nueva
Palmira.
	   For landlocked Bolivia and Paraguay, as well as western Brazil,
the hidrovia would give farmers and miners a cheaper route to get
their goods to market. Bolivia estimated its soy exports could
quadruple to 8 million tons a year.
	   Downriver, in Uruguay and Argentina, the project promised
millions of dollars in shipping business and port fees.
	   The problem was the hidrovia would have to go through the
Pantanal, a 56,000-square-mile (140,000-square-kilometer), nearly
pristine wetland on Brazil's western frontier. It is home to
thousands of types of plants and animals, including endangered
species like jaguars, marsh deer and giant anteaters.
	   Today, barges can navigate the waterway only during eight or
nine months each year because of the Pantanal's seasonal flooding
and draining. Making the hidrovia navigable year-round would
require deepening, straightening and broadening the rivers to as
much as three times their current width at some points.
	   A series of studies, including one by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, warned that the hidrovia would drain large areas of the
Pantanal, upsetting the delicate ecosystem and possibly affecting
migration patterns and even the weather.
	   When ecologists complained, Brazil's government announced it
would scale back the original project to a dlrs 120 million version
that eliminated the most radical change _ the straightening of a
northern section of the Paraguay River.
	   That idea is little better than the original plan, says Stephen
Hamilton, a scientist at Michigan State University who has studied
tropical flood plains and who contributed to the Pantanal study
financed by the Inter-American Development Bank.
	   He says that merely deepening the Paraguay River would be enough
to throw the Pantanal's ecosystem out of whack.
	   And if the waterway is pushed through piecemeal,
environmentalists may become victims of their own success in
opposing the mammoth hidrovia project, Hamilton says.
	   ``Really that's the worst way to go about it,'' he says.'' The
whole system is interdependent, and with no comprehensive plan _
with Bolivia doing one thing and Paraguay doing another _ it will
be even worse than if there was a carefully planned project that
encompassed the entire river system.''
	   Opposition to even the scaled-down plan led Brazil to announce
the hidrovia was suspended.
	   Yet the dredger still pumps away at the Tamengo Channel, a tract
of the hidrovia in Bolivia near Corumba, a Brazilian river city
1,100 miles (1,800 kilometers) northwest of Rio de Janeiro.
	   Faria, the Ecology in Action leader, points out that while the
dredger is based in Bolivia, that doesn't stop the craft from
crossing over to the Brazilian side of the river.
	   Environmental protests are noticeably quieter in other countries
interested in the waterway, and Brazil is sensitive to the
pro-hidrovia sentiment among its partners in the Mercosur common
market: Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay.
	   Despite its March announcement, the Brazilian government has not
formally communicated its intention to stop the project to the
other countries involved. The Foreign Ministry declines to comment
on the project's final status.
	   Some Brazilian officials remain openly bullish on the hidrovia.
	   ``We want a waterway and we still don't have it,'' Jose Alex
Botelho Oliva, policy coordinator for the Transportation Ministry,
said at a recent seminar. ``That's what the Intergovernmental
Waterway Committee is doing. We are working and we will continue to
work.''
	   Shipping companies say failure to build the waterway would cost
the region dlrs 1 billion in annual exports.
	   ``The question isn't whether or not there will be a waterway _
the waterway is already there. Not going ahead with the project is
like not fixing a road that has holes in it,'' says Michel Chaim,
director of CINCO-Bacia, one of the region's biggest shippers.
	   Angelo Rabelo, Corumba's secretary of environment and tourism,
says the dredging is not part of the larger waterway project. But
he hedges when asked if the hidrovia is going ahead.
	   ``We can't put ecological concerns in front of commerce. Nor can
we put commerce in front of ecological concerns,'' Rabelo says.
``If we have to wait another year to make sure (environmental
damage) doesn't happen, we'll wait another year, because there are
enough examples of projects like this that didn't work.''

Long suppressed in Russia, Freud makes a comeback

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Repressed for decades like the childhood traumas
he diagnosed, Sigmund Freud is making a comeback in Russia as the
country sheds the stigmas long attached to psychotherapy.
	   Until a decade ago, Freud's work was banned here and Russians
viewed psychiatric treatment as a nightmarish experience. At its
worst, Soviet authorities used psychiatry to classify political
dissidents as mentally unstable and lock them up in hospitals.
	   Soviet psychiatry relied heavily on drugs designed mostly to
control captive patients. The Western notion of a give-and-take
session between an understanding therapist and voluntary patient
was largely an alien concept.
	   But since the Soviet breakup, Russians have embraced a wide
range of therapies, stoking demand for everything from expensive,
long-term psychoanalysis to traditional faith healing.
	   ``In the Soviet era, it was considered shameful for a person to
seek psychiatric treatment,'' said Alexander Tkhostov, a practicing
psychologist and a professor at Moscow State University. ``The new
generation is much more willing to consider therapy.''
	   And many patients _ and their neuroses _ are products of the
new, chaotic Russia, therapists say. The newly rich Russian man,
overwhelmed by stress in the helter-skelter world of business, is a
typical patient. His bored, neglected wife, who has time and money
to burn, but little sense of purpose, is also a candidate for the
therapist's couch.
	   Sex problems that were taboo subjects in the past are now aired
openly in the media, encouraging some to seek help. And a sharp
rise in drug abuse has created a need for counseling that never
before existed.
	   ``We've become universal specialists because there are so many
different problems and so few places to get help,'' said Marina
Buligina, a psychologist at the Russian-American Recovery Center.
	   The private center, established in 1990 with American help,
counsels people suffering from drug and alcohol abuse. But many
patients now come with problems unrelated to chemical dependency.
	   Russians have traditionally had high rates of depression and
suicide and a legendary reputation for soul searching. That's made
Russians receptive to traditional remedies such as witchcraft and
folk medicine for generations, and more modern approaches are now
taking root.
	   There are crisis hotlines, group therapy and family programs,
and state schools increasingly have their own psychologist on site.
	   Because there was no system for teaching Western methods of
psychotherapy, there are still relatively few practitioners. Most
are in Moscow or St. Petersburg, working in private clinics where
they cater to the new elite and charge 310 Russian rubles (dlrs 50)
or more for one-hour sessions _ a prohibitive rate for the average
Russian.
	   ``Their skill levels are highly variable,'' said Dr. Gary
Goldsmith, a psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School who has been
visiting Russia regularly for several years to help train Russian
psychoanalysts. ``There's a lack of literature. They tend to be
self-taught, and their models tend to be based on an authoritarian
approach to patients.''
	   But, he added, Russian analysts are hungry to study a field that
was forbidden to them for so long.
	   Until his work was banned in 1930, Freud had been well-received
in Russia and the Soviet Union, where communists sought to make his
ideas compatible with Marxist ideology.
	   But Freud's emphasis on a rich and complex inner world proved
incompatible with the Soviet aims of political control and unified
thought, said Martin Miller, a Duke University history professor
and author of a soon-to-be published book, ``Freud and the
Bolsheviks.''
	   Ironically, Freud's resurgence in Russia comes at a time when
his ideas are on the defensive, if not in retreat, in much of the
West. There are now many different styles of therapy, and
scientific breakthroughs have led to an increase in the use of
drugs to treat anxiety, stress and depression.
	   Freud won formal re-acceptance in Russia in 1996 when President
Boris Yeltsin issued a decree recognizing the legitimacy of
psychoanalysis.
	   ``Psychoanalysis has rehabilitated Soviet psychiatry,'' claimed
Dr. Aron Belkin, president of the Russian Psychoanalytic Society.
``It was forbidden fruit for so long that people now want it, and
it has blossomed very quickly.''
	   Belkin, a gentle man of 70 who keeps a sketch of Freud on his
office wall, helped revive psychoanalysis a decade ago, a time when
Soviet psychiatry was still badly tarnished for its role in
institutionalizing political dissidents.
	   At least 1,000 dissidents were hospitalized from the late 1950s
to the mid-1980s, and the actual number may have been as high as
20,000, according to Peter Reddaway, a political science professor
at George Washington University and co-author of two books on the
subject.
	   Such abuses have stopped, but many of the same psychiatrists and
psychologists are still practicing at state institutions and
``there has not been a major shakeup in the leadership of
psychiatry,'' Reddaway said.
	   Belkin, who studied Freud's works surreptitiously during the
Soviet years, said there are still many divisions in the Russian
psychiatric community.
	   Some old-school psychiatrists still defend the Soviet methods,
while those studying Freud and other Western psychiatrists are
divided into rival camps.
	   ``We are working to find our own path,'' said Belkin. ``It is
difficult to apply psychoanalysis in this country without knowing
the history and the people.''

	   The millennium computer bug could threaten irrigation along the
Nile. Airlines may have to suspend flying some routes. Venezuela's
coordinator for year 2000 computer problems says his country is
``in an emergency.''
	   The United States, Britain, Canada and some other countries have
devoted billions of dollars preparing for 2000, when computers with
dates in their programs could go haywire.
	   But an Associated Press survey of businesses, government
agencies and information technology researchers in 16 countries
suggests many nations are only now waking up to the problem.
	   Computer experts warn that when 2000 clicks in, many countries
could face widespread power outages, transportation foul-ups and
telecommunications failures because of confused computers.
	   No one knows exactly what will happen. With last-minute fixes _
and luck _ disruptions could be minimal. But experts are
pessimistic.
	   Edward Yardeni, chief economist for the international investment
firm Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, predicts a 70 percent chance of
global recession at least as serious as during the 1973-74 oil
crisis.
	   ``If we have everything fixed in the United States but there's
major disruptions in Europe and total calamity in Asia and Latin
America, we're going to be affected in a very, very adverse
fashion,'' Yardeni told The Associated Press.
	   Experts say laggards include Germany, Japan and Russia, major
players in a closely intertwined global economy that is due for a
shock when an unknown number of computer systems and integrated
circuits lose track of time.
	   Early software engineers sowed the seeds for the year 2000
problem when, for economy's sake, they decided to express years
with just the final two digits rather than all four.
	   When the century comes to a close, many untreated computer
systems will then interpret double zero to mean 1900, potentially
turning bank ledgers and business records into gibberish while
elevators, assembly lines and other machines shut down, unable to
comprehend the new date.
	   Even if the United States, the world's most computerized nation,
gets the problem fixed, the globalization of economies makes
everyone vulnerable to failures outside their borders.
	   Sever a key link _ power, finance, telecommunications, medical
devices, transportation _ even for a few days and the implications
are dire.
	   The airline industry promises planes won't fall out of the sky,
but radar and air traffic control glitches could make it unsafe to
fly over some nations.
	   The 258 member airlines of the International Air Transport
Association have just pooled dlrs 20 million to help needy nations
get their air traffic systems ready for 2000.
	   Still, some airlines may have to ground some planes that first
week of the new millennium if they don't consider certain routes
safe. Carriers remain unsure whether their insurers will cover year
2000-related calamities.
	   Telecommunications are also a worry.
	   ``I think it's going to be nearly impossible to make a phone
call from the United States to Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, maybe
even Japan'' in the first days of 2000, Yardeni said.
	   A survey of 113 countries by the U.S. State Department found
that telecommunications companies in 33 of them were having
problems with year 2000 fixes and that 29 others were unaware of or
had not begun to address the problem.
	   In most of the world, computer programmers will have to perform
triage _ fixing mission-critical systems and taking secondary ones
off line.
	   Capers Jones, chairman of Burlington, Massachusetts-based
Software Productivity Research and a leading year 2000 researcher,
estimates the global cost of revising software at dlrs 1.1
trillion. That doesn't include embedded computer chips in
everything from VCRs to offshore oil rigs that must be inventoried,
checked and fixed if necessary.
	   Egypt is among nations still in the information-gathering phase.
It is trying to assess how to ensure power is not lost in the Nile
basin, the country's lifeline where 24 million people work in
agriculture and depend on electricity for irrigation.
	   ``This is a system which is regulated very, very carefully,''
said Bayoumi Attia, a senior planning official at the Ministry of
Public Works and Irrigation.
	   He predicted ``a mess'' if the power grid shut down for more
than a few days. A month-long outage would destroy crops, he
warned.
	   At an Asia-wide workshop in Thailand in June attended by experts
from national statistics agencies, representatives from China and
Nepal said awareness was so low in their countries that many people
thought the 2000 bug was just another malignant computer virus.
	   Even where awareness is higher, other issues have taken
precedence: Programmers in much of Europe are distracted converting
business and government computers to deal with the 1999 start of
the European Union's single currency. Asia is consumed by financial
crisis. Russia is trying to stave off economic implosion.
	   A survey by the Gartner Group found that half of 6,000 companies
in 47 countries will not have at least 20 percent of their
mission-critical systems fixed and tested in time for 2000. Most
were small companies likely to be suppliers of larger companies.

UNDATED: larger companies.

<TEXT>
	   That's where the cascade effect comes in. Just because a company
is prepared doesn't mean its key suppliers or trading partners will
be.
	   An estimated dlrs 3 trillion is transferred electronically every
day on global markets, where a computer glitch can be costly. The
London Stock Exchange is thus demanding stringent year 2000
compliance of anyone with whom it does electronic business.
	   Have your computers fixed by mid-1999 or you don't trade, it
insists.
	   In Japan, the world's second most computerized nation, officials
of three major banks _ the Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi, Dai-ichi
Kangyo and Sakura _ told the AP their year 2000 projects are
running on schedule.
	   But a computer expert in Tokyo, Yoshiya Fuhita of NRI
Information Systems, said he believes Japanese banks ``are in a
dangerous state.'' The country's financial sector lags well behind
the United States, spending just one-tenth as much on software
fixes, he said.
	   Although technology analysts say Germany is also well behind, a
top German interior ministry official, Eckart Werthebach, said
regular checks of mainframe computers will ensure that pensions,
for example, are paid on time.
	   One of Russia's most sensitive industries seems not even to
understand the issue.
	   ``We don't have any problems yet,'' the Atomic Energy Ministry's
spokesman, Vladislav Petrov, said. ``We'll deal with the problem in
the year 2000.''
	   In the developing world, money and political will are typically
lacking.
	   Venezuela's government, for example, has not even begun
examining its computers to assess what repairs are needed.
	   ``We're in an emergency,'' warned Edgar Martinez, the country's
year 2000 coordinator.
	   Martinez fears a paralysis lasting at least a week, including
widespread power outages, a halt for Caracas' subway and computer
failures that could wipe out pension payments, academic records and
payrolls.
	   ``We're going to have all kinds of problems,'' he said.

Worrying scenes from the computer glitch front

<TEXT>
	   The world's top corporations and banks have been grappling with
the year 2000 computer problem for several years, but researchers
say small- to mid-size companies and national and local governments
are generally only now beginning in earnest.
	   A look at some potential problem areas:
	   ___
	   A June survey of 378 mid-size German companies by
Frankfurt-based KHK Software found 57 percent had done nothing to
address the year 2000 problem or the impending conversion from the
German mark to the European Union's new single currency; only 3
percent had budgeted for it.
	   ___
	   About 70 percent of France's roughly 1 million small businesses
don't even consider themselves affected by the millennium bug, says
Jean-Pierre Tanne, information specialist for the Chamber of
Commerce and Industry. ``They have no methodological approach, not
tools, no technical support.''
	   ___
	   Of 50 companies queried in Russia, only a third _ all large
financial institutions _ were aware of the bug. And many banks
erroneously think they will not be affected because their computer
hardware is relatively new, says Pat Kellehern, a computer system
consultant for Coopers and Lybrand. ``There's a worrying trend that
seems to suggest the banks don't think they have a problem. I'm not
sure they're taking it seriously.''
	   ___
	   Britain's government is spending about dlrs 5 billion on the
problem, says Gwynneth Flower, managing director of its Action 2000
group, which is trying to help industry cope with the bug. She says
Britons could, however, experience power outages from computer
problems. ``You can't say we will have no impact from the bug. It
will affect everybody.''
	   ___
	   Some European airports could experience problems with air
traffic control, Britain's Flower adds. ``We're asking those
questions. We're awaiting the replies.''
	   ___
	   China's problems with the 2000 bug are compounded by its
reliance on all kinds of software from foreign and Chinese
developers and on Chinese-pirated versions of software. Zhang Qi,
the Information Ministry official in charge of her country's
efforts to fix the problem, told the China Daily in May that
``China hasn't seriously considered the year 2000 glitch.''
	   ___
	   Thousands of Indian programmers are working on year 2000 fixes,
but their employers are almost exclusively abroad, and Indian
industry and government haven't fully faced the problem. ``We
haven't done enough,'' says Ravindra Gupta, a top official in the
federal Electronics Department.

Hashimoto throws cold water on talk of Japan tax cuts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's tax policy became muddled over the weekend
after Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto appeared to step back from
earlier indications that he planned major, permanent income tax
cuts.
	   Speaking on national television Sunday, Hashimoto said that
while his government would debate permanent reforms to Japan's
income tax system, it was not certain there would be any net
reduction of the country's tax burden.
	   ``I don't think the result of the debate will be a tax rise ...
but it's possible the result will be neutral'' in terms of the tax
burden, Hashimoto said.
	   The comments, exactly one week ahead of key upper house
elections for Parliament, came after Hashimoto on Friday said for
the first time that he would support a permanent tax cut to
stimulate consumer spending.
	   Japan is under increasing pressure from the United States and
other trading partners to boost growth in its recession-plagued
economy and create a market for goods from troubled Asian
neighbors.
	   Media reports in recent days had suggested that the government
was considering up to 4 trillion yen (dlrs 29 billion) in income
tax cuts for next year to boost consumer spending and help spur
growth.
	   On Saturday, Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi met U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright in Tokyo and, in a joint news conference,
described permanent tax cuts as a ``promise'' which Japan intended
to keep.
	   But on Sunday, Koichi Kato, a key official in Hashimoto's ruling
Liberal Democratic Party, reportedly suggested that any tax cuts
would be far smaller that what had been hoped for.
	   During campaigning, Kato said a net tax reduction should be
limited to 100 billion yen (dlrs 714 million) or 200 billion yen
(dlrs 1.43 billion), Kyodo news agency reported.
	   The confusion suggested the tax issue has become hostage to
political rhetoric ahead of the July 12 elections. It may also be a
sign of bickering within the government over plans to revive the
economy and over the assurances it has given Japan's international
trading partners.
	   Hashimoto's party holds 118 of the upper house's 252 seats. In
the upcoming election, they are hoping to regain a majority for the
first time since 1989. A majority would allow them to pass
legislation through the upper house without cooperation from
opposition politicians.
	   Hashimoto's party already controls the Cabinet because it has
262 of the 500 seats in the more powerful lower house.
	   Currency markets expressed disappointment with Hashimoto's
Sunday comments, pushing the yen lower against the U.S. dollar in
early Asian trading Monday.
	   In Tokyo, the U.S. dollar bought 140.46 yen, up 1.22 yen from
its late Tokyo level of 139.24 yen on Friday.

Out with the old and crowded, Hong Kong opens futuristic airport

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ After a nostalgic farewell to the old and
overcrowded, Hong Kong opened a futuristic dlrs 20 billion new
airport on Monday intended to secure its place as a global
transportation hub for the 21st century.
	   Officials reported a smooth overnight move of 1,300 vehicles, 16
barges and 31 aircraft from downtown Kai Tak airport and a good
start at Chek Lap Kok, which was built by leveling two small
islands and reclaiming land 30 kilometers (22 miles) away.
	   The last operations of downtown Kai Tak, famous for its low
approach and sharp final turn over crowded Kowloon, and the first
at Chek Lap Kok were full of symbolism.
	   Chek Lap Kok's first arrival was an inaugural non-stop polar
flight by Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific airline from New York at 6:25
a.m. (2220 GMT Sunday). Officials said the 15 hour, 35-minute
flight was the longest commercial flight in history.
	   Like many people, Co-pilot Mike Lowes, who landed the flight
from New York, said he would miss Kai Tak, but he was full of
praise for the new facility. ``It's just very smooth and
up-to-date,'' he said.
	   Passengers reported no problems getting through immigration, and
one of 14 carousels began churning out their luggage 20 minutes
after the flight arrived. The New York flight was followed within
the hour by planes from Rome and Mauritius. Eight flights left for
Asian cities in the first two hours of service.
	   Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa said that the successful move and
opening of the new airport proved Hong Kong's ``can-do'' spirit. It
came at a time when the territory's confidence in its economic
strength and entrepreneurial ability has been shaken by Asia's
recession.
	   Kai Tak's last operations were a departure for Britain _ Hong
Kong's former colonial ruler _ and an arrival from China _ the new
sovereign after Britain returned the territory to China last year.
	   Piloted by Capt. Kim Sharman, a 21-year veteran making his last
flight, the London-bound Cathay Pacific jumbo jet left at two
minutes past midnight on Monday, closing Kai Tak's 73-year history.
	   A little more than an hour later, after several planes left to
be rebased at the new airport, officials shut down the runway
lights, making Kai Tak a piece of history. Eventually, the site on
Kowloon Bay is to be redeveloped for housing, which is in
chronically short supply in crowded Hong Kong.
	   Throughout the day on Sunday, Hong Kong residents jammed the old
airport, bringing their children and their cameras for a last,
nostalgic look. Despite the noise and overcrowding of Kai Tak, Hong
Kong had a hard time saying good-bye.
	   But as Monday dawned, the focus shifted to the future.
	   Economically, the new airport couldn't be opening at a worse
time. Moving their headquarters has driven costs up for airlines at
a time when business is down due to the regional recession. For
Cathay Pacific, passenger loads are at a 10-year low.
	   Landing charges will be about 20 percent higher.
	   The new airport was under discussion for years because of the
limits imposed by Kai Tak's downtown location. But work wasn't
begun until 1989, in the midst of British-Chinese negotiations over
the details of the handover. That was the same year as the
Tiananmen massacre in Beijing, which rattled Hong Kong's people.
	   China accused Britain of trying to empty Hong Kong's coffers
with the huge airport, and there were construction delays and
controversies.
	   The entire project at one point included half the world's
dredging fleet, and a variety of connections from the remote
airport to downtown _ 1.38 kilometer (4,475-foot) suspension
bridge, an express highway and a railway link.
	   Chek Lap Kok's eight-level terminal, with a metal wing-like roof
designed by British architect Norman Foster, is one of the biggest
enclosed spaces in the world at 516,000 square meters (6 million
square feet).
	   The glass-walled terminal gives a sweeping view of mountains, a
glimpse of the ocean, and plenty of sunlight. Unlike the old
airport, which closed nightly because of the noise, it will be open
around the clock.
	   A second runway is to open later this year. Officials have
estimated it will take 35 million passengers in its first year, and
eventually be able to handle 87 million annually.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Three days of diplomatic efforts by
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke have produced no signs of resolving
the crisis in Yugoslavia's rebellious Kosovo province. Now the
diplomatic efforts shift to a group of foreign observers.
	   The group, comprised of Belgrade-based diplomats from the United
States, Russia, Poland and the European Union, planned to visit
flashpoints in Kosovo on Monday.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in Kosovo since a Serb
police crackdown on ethnic Albanian militants in February.
	   Holbrooke spent the weekend shuttling between Kosovo's capital
Pristina and Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital, trying to lay the
ground work for talks between the Yugoslav government and leaders
of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority.
	   After meeting with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
Holbrooke said in Belgrade late Sunday that the past three days in
the region had been ``very useful in clarifying many issues.''
	   ``I'm not going to say it's making progress because that would
mislead you,'' he said. ``But it's certainly not a failure.''
	   Milosevic approved the diplomats' visits Monday under an
agreement last month with Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
	   ``Tomorrow's launching of the Kosovo observer mission ... is the
return of an important major international diplomatic observer
presence in Kosovo,'' Holbrooke said.
	   In Pristina Sunday, Holbrooke and Russian Deputy Foreign
Minister Nikolai Afanasyevsky urged ethnic Albanian politicians to
rally behind moderate leader Ibrahim Rugova, insisting he is the
best choice to speak for Kosovo's Albanian majority.
	   The two met with representatives of the 16 ethnic Albanian
parties.
	   But representatives from the militant Kosovo Liberation Army did
not attend the talks. The group is fighting for independence from
Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   Holbrooke is trying to persuade all Albanian factions _
including the KLA _ to accept Rugova's leadership. The militants
have so far refused.
	   It was unclear whether Holbrooke's latest effort had narrowed
the differences within the factious Albanian community. But
Holbrooke stressed his support for Rugova and said he would
continue to talk with talks with the Albanian leader and Milosevic
would continue.
	   Afanasyevsky also urged support for Rugova and repeated Moscow's
refusal to negotiate directly with the KLA _ which Russia and
Yugoslavia consider a terrorist group.
	   The U.S. and Russian mediators are encouraging the Albanians to
overcome their differences and speak with a single voice in
negotiations with Milosevic over the future of the province.
	   Milosevic has expressed willingness to restore autonomy he
canceled in 1989. On Sunday Holbrooke refused to say if a form of
autonomy is shaping up for Kosovo, although ``some change in the
current status of Kosovo within the international boundaries of
Yugoslavia is essential.''
	   But Rugova and others are demanding full independence.
Nevertheless, Rugova is considered a more acceptable negotiating
partner because he opposes violence.
	   The Serb crackdown, which has claimed hundreds of lives since
late February, has undercut Rugova's moderate appeal and helped
bolster support for the Kosovo Liberation Army.

First trial on genocide charges opens at U.N. war crimes tribunal

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A Bosnian Serb accused of
orchestrating atrocities against scores of Muslims and Croats in
three notorious prison camps is going on trial in the Yugoslav war
crimes tribunal's first genocide case.
	   Milan Kovacevic, 57, is charged with genocide, war crimes and
crimes against humanity for his ``key role'' in atrocities
committed in the Prijedor municipality of northwest Bosnia in 1992.
	   He has pleaded innocent to genocide and was scheduled to enter a
plea to the other charges before his trial got under way Monday. If
convicted, he faces a maximum life sentence.
	   His trial, the U.N. court's seventh, was initially scheduled for
May but was delayed when prosecutors filed additional charges
against him. He now faces a total of 15 counts.
	   Prosecutors and defense lawyers were scheduled to present their
opening arguments in the trial, which will publicize alleged
atrocities in three of the Bosnian war's most infamous prison
camps: Omarska, Keraterm and Trnopolje.
	   According to his indictment, Kovacevic, an anesthesiologist, was
among a group of municipal officials who engineered a violent
campaign to expel Bosnian Muslims and Croats from Prijedor between
April and December 1992.
	   Kovacevic was the vice-president of the so-called ``Crisis
Staff,'' which ordered attacks on non-Serb villages, the seizure
and detention of Bosnian Muslims and Croats and the establishment
of prison camps.
	   The alleged atrocities began with attacks on non-Serb villages
involving heavy artillery bombardments by Serb forces.
	   Some of those who survived the attacks were executed. Many
others were rounded up and taken to one of the camps, where
hundreds were tortured and killed by their Serb captors.
	   The conditions at Omarska, Keraterm and Trnopolje were ``abject
and brutal,'' Kovacevic's indictment alleges.
	   ``Detainees were continuously subjected to or forced to witness
inhuman acts, including murder, rape and sexual assaults, torture,
beatings and robbery,'' it reads.
	   The Trnopolje camp was where most of the alleged sexual assault,
rape and torture of female detainees was carried out by camp
personnel, tribunal prosecutors say.
	   Kovacevic, who was the director of the Prijedor Medical Center
before his arrest, was detained last summer by British NATO troops.
He was arrested at the hospital without a fight, but another
genocide suspect, Simo Drljaca, Prijedor's notorious former police
chief, was killed in a gun battle with the British soldiers.
	   Kovacevic is the first to stand trial on genocide charges, but
he is not the only suspect facing that charge.
	   The tribunal also has indicted former Bosnian Serb leader
Radovan Karadzic and his wartime military commander, Ratko Mladic,
for genocide and war crimes. The pair, the top two suspects, remain
at large.
	   The tribunal, set up in 1993 by the Security Council, has
publicly indicted 60 people for alleged war crimes in the former
Yugoslavia and has issued an unknown number of secret indictments.
Twenty-seven suspects are in custody.

Dollar higher, Tokyo stocks fall in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen early Monday
on receding hopes the Japanese government would cut taxes to spur
the economy. Japanese stock prices fell moderately.
	   The dollar bought 140.46 yen in early trading, up 1.22 yen from
late Friday in Tokyo. Financial markets in New York were closed
Friday for the U.S. Independence Day holiday.
	   The yen weakened following comments by Japan's Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto on Sunday that seemed to backtrack from remarks
he made last week suggesting a permanent tax cut to stimulate
consumer spending.
	   Speaking on national television, Hashimoto said that while his
government would debate permanent reforms to Japan's income tax
system, it was not certain there would be any net reduction of the
country's tax burden.
	   ``I don't think the result of the debate will be a tax rise ...
but it's possible the result will be neutral'' in terms of the tax
burden, Hashimoto said.
	   Japan has been awash in speculation recently that the government
and ruling Liberal Democratic Party are planning income tax cuts
aimed at encouraging consumer spending to help boost the economy
out of recession.
	   The tax-cut talk has come amid campaigning for July 12 elections
to the upper house of Parliament.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
shed 77.62 points, or 0.47 percent, to 16,433.62 points in the
first 30 minutes of trading. The Nikkei index gained 39.66 points,
or 0.24 percent, on Friday, for its eighth straight rise.
	   Many investors retreated to the sidelines on Monday to monitor
developments regarding tax cuts.
	   ``Investors want to see in what way a tax cut is implemented,''
said Setsuo Nagao, a manager in the stock trading division of Tokyo
Securities.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 4.57 points, or 0.36 percent, to 1,263.79
points. The TOPIX closed down 2.10 points, or 0.17 percent on
Friday.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.330 percent from Friday's finish of 1.340
percent, driving its price up to 110.97 yen from 110.90 yen.

Two 20-year-olds force Monday playoff at Open

<TEXT>
	   KOHLER, Wisconsin (AP) _ Jenny Chuasiriporn and Se Ri Pak, two
very different 20-year-olds emerging as forces in golf, stood over
two very different putts on the 72nd hole at the U.S. Women's Open.
	   One was seemingly impossible, the other very makeable.
	   The shocker on Sunday, though, was which one fell and which one
didn't.
	   ``The last 15 feet (4.5 meters) my eyes probably popped out,''
said Chuasiriporn, an amateur who made a 40-foot (12-meter) birdie
putt on No. 18, then watched as Pak missed an eight-footer
(2.5-meters) for birdie on the same hole that would have meant a
victory.
	   The two were scheduled to meet later Monday in an 18-hole
playoff to determine the youngest winner in the 53-year history of
the Women's Open.
	   Nerves finally got to Pak, the shy and stoic South Korean who,
in leading the tournament since Friday, had seemed so impervious to
pressure through 71 holes.
	   But she missed her birdie putt by about two inches (5 cms).
	   ``The last putt went straight and it needed to break,'' a
still-unflappable Pak said with a shrug.
	   Chuasiriporn wasn't nervous. She didn't even know she was
putting for a share of the lead.
	   ``Right before she hit the putt, I looked up at the leaderboard
and saw them change Pak's score,'' said her caddy and brother, Joey
Chuasiriporn. ``When the putt went in, everything happened so fast
I didn't even have time to tell her.''
	   When her improbable birdie putt fell, Chuasiriporn put her left
hand over her mouth in amazement, then double high-fived her
brother.
	   ``Just incredible,'' Chuasiriporn said. ``Wow.''
	   Now, Pak and Chuasiriporn will play at least one more round on
the unforgiving Blackwolf Run Golf Course, where only one golfer
has broken par since Friday.
	   If they're still tied after that, they'll go to sudden death.
	   Pak might have missed her putt, but she made the money.
	   Because Chuasiriporn is an amateur, Pak got the dlrs 267,500
first-place check before she even left the clubhouse.
	   Even though she's playing for pride and not pay, Chuasiriporn
can't wait.
	   ``I really enjoy just playing,'' said Chuasiriporn, who will be
a senior at Duke University next fall. ``Just two 20-year-olds, I
guess. It should to be fun.''
	   If the 18th hole is any indication, it should be fantastic, too.
	   After Chuasiriporn's dramatic putt brought her into a tie for
the lead at six over for the tournament, Pak, playing in the next,
and final, twosome, missed hers, setting up Monday's playoff.
	   ``It was difficult to play today and I didn't play my best,''
Pak said. ``Hopefully, I'll play better tomorrow. I wasn't nervous.
It's been a great week and a tough course and I'm still tied for
first.''
	   Pak, who began the day with a one-stroke lead, finished with a
5-over 76 for a 6-over 290 for 72 holes. Chuasiriporn, who had a
closing 72, started the round four strokes back, tied for fourth.
	   Chuasiriporn, who was fifth at the U.S. college championships at
Madison two months ago, will try to become the first amateur to win
an Open since Catherine LaCoste in 1967. Her 72-hole total is the
lowest ever for an amateur in an Open.
	   Pak, perhaps South Korea's most famous athlete, who won the LPGA
Championship in May, is seeking to become the first rookie to win
two majors since Juli Inkster captured the Nabisco Dinah Shore and
du Maurier Ltd. Classic in 1984. The last woman to win consecutive
majors was Meg Mallon in 1991.
	   The drama at 18 capped an unbelievable round in which Pak,
Chuasiriporn and several others, including Mhairi McKay, Liselotte
Neumann, Chris Johnson and Pat Hurst all had a shot at winning the
tournament.
	   Neumann parred 18 for a 76 and finished one shot out of the
playoff.
	   ``It was a disappointing day,'' Neumann said. ``I didn't get
anything going today. It was a long day out there. I didn't make
any birdies; it's difficult to win an Open with no birdies.''
	   But this ought to make her feel better: Because Chuasiriporn
will leave without any money, Neumann got the second-place windfall
of dlrs 157,500 instead of the third-place money of dlrs 77,351.
	   Danielle Ammaccapane, who began the round seven strokes back,
shot an even-par 71 to finish in a three-way tie for fourth at
8-over 292, along with Hurst (73) and Johnson (74).
	   The last playoff at the Open was in 1992, when Patty Sheehan
defeated Inkster by two strokes at Oakmont, Pennsylvania.
	   The 6,412-yard (5,861-meters) layout is the second-longest in
the 53 editions of the Women's Open. And swirling gusts off Lake
Michigan blew drives off course, scattered approach shots and left
everybody above par Saturday.

Protestants go on rampage after Orangemen blocked at Portadown

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Protestants attacked police,
hijacked cars and blocked roads in many parts of Northern Ireland
overnight after British authorities blocked the province's most
controversial Orange Order march.
	   More than 1,000 Protestants remained encamped early Monday
outside Drumcree Anglican church on the outskirts of Portadown, 30
miles (50 kms) southwest of Belfast. Extensive barbed-wire
barricades blocked the Protestant fraternal group's annual parade
before it reached the town's nearby Catholic section, Garvaghy
Road.
	   As darkness fell Sunday, hard-line Protestants fulfilled their
threat to launch a campaign of protest and street mayhem to stretch
police reserves. They say it, like the Drumcree standoff itself,
will continue until Portadown's Orangemen are allowed to parade
down their usual route.
	   In Belfast, mobs of young men and youths menaced roads in
Protestant areas, intimidating most citizens from trying to drive
at night. Some of those who did drive had their vehicles
confiscated by force to be used as flaming road barricades.
	   Police armored cars rammed three burning cars off of north
Belfast's Crumlin Road, only to watch hooligans steal and burn five
more to reblock the roadway. It was also littered with broken glass
and rocks, a sofa and shattered pinball machine.
	   In south-central Belfast, rioters briefly spilled onto the
so-called ``golden mile'' of upscale shops, bistros and pubs before
police chased them back into a nearby working-class neighborhood.
Several vehicles were stolen, upended in the roadway, torched and
used as cover for masked youths tossing gasoline bombs at police,
who responded with plastic bullets.
	   Police reported similar scenes in other Protestant
public-housing projects and villages across Northern Ireland,
reflecting substantial opposition to a peace process that has meant
conceding ground to the north's large Catholic minority.
	   Police said no serious injuries were reported, despite the
destruction. They also arrested four Catholic men and four
teen-agers on the roof of an Orange hall in Newry, 30 miles (50
kms) south of Belfast, on suspicion of trying to burn it down.
	   Democratic Unionist Party leader Ian Paisley, the chief opponent
of April's peace agreement among eight other parties, arrived at
the Orange standoff in Drumcree at 1 a.m. (0000 GMT) to huge
applause and cheers from the crowd.
	   ``This is a battle that has to be won _ no ifs, no buts,''
Paisley shouted to the crowd.
	   He condemned the government-appointed Parades Commission's
decision to prevent Orangemen from marching down Garvaghy Road.
Catholic militants have organized opposition there for the past
four years _ and helped trigger a violent confrontation with the
80,000-member Orange Order and its supporters for three summers
running.
	   ``The most basic reason that this problem has not been settled
is the fact that the Orange Order has refused to talk to the
protesters in many of the disputed localities,'' said Alistair
Graham, chairman of the Parades Commission.
	   ``They're going to have to talk to somebody, sometime,'' Graham
added in exasperation. Orange leaders have refused to recognize the
commission's authority.
	   Later Monday, Graham said he would announce the commission's
verdicts on whether to permit 28 Orange parades scheduled for July
13 that pass near or through predominantly Catholic areas and are
facing protests.
	   In 1996, police tried to block the Orangemen at Drumcree but
relented after four nights of disruption and bloodshed, forcing
Catholic protesters off Garvaghy Road. A Portadown-based gang, the
Loyalist Volunteer Force, played its part in reversing the police
deployment by abducting and killing a Catholic taxi driver and
threatening to kill more.
	   In 1997, the police commander cited the prospect of random LVF
killings of Catholics as one reason why he saturated Garvaghy Road
with soldiers and police before dawn to permit the march. That
decision sparked widespread Catholic rioting.
	   On Sunday the LVF's reputed commander, Mark ``Swinger'' Fulton,
strode up to Drumcree church in his trademark leather jacket and
gold hoop earring to be warmly greeted by many Orangemen and their
families.
	   Referring to the British minister responsible for governing
Northern Ireland, Fulton said: ``Mo Mowlam thinks she can break the
backbone of the Protestant people by facing down the Orangemen of
Portadown. But the Orange Order was born here in County Armagh. We
won't let it die here.''

New Zealand cancels Diana stamps
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ New Zealand Post announced Monday
it has canceled an issue of stamps commemorating the first
anniversary of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.
	   The postal service said it was concerned about the
``over-commercialization'' of the princess' death, and added that a
four-month wait for approval for the stamps from the Diana,
Princess of Wales Memorial Trust meant the company could not meet
print deadlines.
	   The stamps, featuring a photograph of Diana, were scheduled for
issue on Aug. 26 but were withdrawn from the stamp program.
	   In a letter apologizing to standing-order customers and
collectors of first-day covers, stamps general manager Russell
Watson said: ``The decision to produce this issue was made at a
time of great public grief. Since then there has been a wide range
of commemorative items produced.
	   ``The over-commercialization of Princess Diana's death has
influenced our decision.
	   ``We realize this may be a disappointment. However, we have not
ruled out celebrating the princess' life at a later time.''
	   In February, the British Post Office issued stamps commemorating
the Princess of Wales and predicted they would be the
biggest-selling set in history.

Final Four has one surprise

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The host against the longshot. The defending
champions against the most-balanced team. Sounds like a final four
worthy of any World Cup.
	   Not that these are the greatest teams soccer has produced.
Brazil's 1970 team certainly was superior to its current squad. The
1974 and '78 Dutch, featuring the revolutionary ``Clockwork
Orange'' attack, probably would blow away the 1998 Netherlands
teams.
	   Still, that's nitpicking. The storylines are superb for these
semifinals, with the French playing the Croats on Wednesday, one
day after Brazil meets the Netherlands.
	   The last home team to win the Cup came in 1978, when Argentina
defeated the last of those great Dutch clubs at Buenos Aires. In
fact, no host has made the final since.
	   France has reached the final four despite an inability to find
the net. It beat one-dimensional Paraguay 1-0 on a sudden-death
overtime goal by Laurent Blanc in the second round. Blanc had the
deciding shot in a penalty kick shootout against Italy in the
quarterfinals.
	   ``I know the problem and there is no explanation,'' said captain
Didier Deschamps of his team's poor marksmanship, despite dozens of
chances to score.
	   Another close game might not benefit France, which hasn't faced
as rugged an opponent at Croatia. Then again, if the French find
the range early, they have a superior attack.
	   Croatia can withstand physical play, as it did against Germany.
It also has impressive counter-attacking skills, and its defense
has been among the staunchest in the Cup.
	   As a World Cup first-timer, the Croatians should be somewhat
overwhelmed by the occasion. Don't count on it: Many of them have
solid international backgrounds. Croatia made the European
Championship field two years ago, so its achievement as the first
newcomer to make the semis is somewhat misleading.
	   ``For 45 years in Yugoslavia, we never played with the same fire
as we are for Croatia,'' said defender Igor Stimac.
	   Unlike in 1994, when Brazil outclassed the field, it has been
inconsistent this year. The Brazilians have been brilliant at
times, ordinary at others. Their 3-2 victory over Denmark in the
quarterfinals demonstrated their sensational scoring power, but
also displayed once more the problems they've had on defense.
	   Coach Mario Zagallo believes the Dutch are the toughest team
Brazil has faced thus far. He's correct.
	   ``They have a refined ball touch and great individual talent,''
he said. ``It's impressive that they can lose a player like (Marc)
Overmars and not feel the difference.''
	   Overmars played less than a half against Argentina in the
quarterfinals, slowed by a hamstring injury. He's expected to start
against Brazil.
	   Unlike Winston Bogarde. The Dutch defender broke his right leg
in a heavy fall during training Sunday.
	   ``It is a terrible disappointment for him personally and for the
team after the euphoria of yesterday,'' said Dutch coach Guus
Hiddink.
	   ``We have to see if he will be operated on in Amsterdam or if a
surgeon will be flown here.''
	   Another Dutch defender, Arthur Numan, is suspended because a
second yellow card against Argentina meant expulsion. But that is
evened out by a one-game ban on Brazil'a attack-minded defender
Cafu for two yellows spread over two games.
	   At times, the Dutch defense has looked a step slow. If any team
can capitalize on that, it is one led by the likes of Ronaldo,
Rivaldo, Bebeto and Cesar Sampaio.
	   ``Brazil will be more difficult than Argentina,'' said Dutch
star striker Dennis Bergkamp, whose last-minute goal lifted the
Netherlands into the semis. ``They will always attack and test your
defense.''
	   The Dutch have also had their moments, good and bad. They had a
shaky first round marred by Patrick Kluivert's two-game suspension
after elbowing a Belgian opponent in a lackluster 0-0 opener. They
routed South Korea, but then blew a 2-0 lead in the second half
against Mexico. The 2-2 tie allowed them to win the group, but not
in the manner they preferred.
	   But the Netherlands has opened things up since.
	   ``If we play the same way, not as individuals, I think we will
do well against Brazil,'' coach Guus Hiddink said. ``But they are a
totally different opponent.''

Finance ministers to discuss Pacific free trade zone
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT KEITH-REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SUVA, Fiji (AP) _ Pacific island finance ministers will discuss
the formation of a free trade zone covering their 14 independent
states at their third annual meeting opening Monday.
	   The recommendations of the meeting, which runs through Wednesday
at Nadi, Fiji, will be forwarded for endorsement by Pacific heads
of state at their annual summit in late August at Pohnpei,
Federated States of Micronesia.
	   Officials at the Forum Secretariat said the concept of a free
trade zone was discussed and approved by the finance ministers at
their meeting last year at Cairns, Australia, but many details were
not resolved.
	   This week's meeting has a wide agenda covering trade, tourism,
investment and economic development.
	   They will also review progress made in improving public
accountability in government and business, a pre-condition to
attracting investment to Pacific nations, some of which have been
blighted by corruption and mismanagement.
	   Progress and economic growth has been virtually nil for years in
many Pacific nations.
	   Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka will formally open the meeting
Monday afternoon at the Sheraton Fiji report at Denarau island near
Nadi airport.

Novotna, Mandlikova share triumph at Wimbledon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs &QL; 
 &UR; By STEVEN WINE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ When Jana Novotna finally won
Wimbledon, it meant a breakthrough for Hana Mandlikova, too.
	   Player and coach celebrated together at Centre Court after
Novotna beat Nathalie Tauziat 6-4, 7-6 (7-2) in the women's final.
	   Novotna was a Wimbledon runnerup in 1993 and 1997. Mandlikova
finished second twice in the 1980s at Wimbledon, the only Grand
Slam she failed to win.
	   Their past frustrations made Saturday's victory something to
savor, and Novotna dedicated her first major title to Mandlikova,
her coach since 1990.
	   ``Without her, I never would have made this championship,''
Novotna said. ``When we started to work together, she simply made
me a better player. She put so much hard work into this, and she
always believed in me.''
	   Many others doubted Novotna, whose fragile psyche was often her
undoing. She sobbed on the shoulder of the Duchess of Kent after
blowing a big lead in the 1993 Wimbledon final. She led again in
the 1997 final before losing to Martina Hingis.
	   ``I was the one who always believed that she could do it if she
put the hard work in,'' Mandlikova said. ``I've always tried to
instill security in her. I tried to instill positive thinking. It
took four years to get it into her, talking every day to her,
telling her to give 100 percent to the sport.''
	   Novotna's first Wimbledon title might not be her last. She turns
30 in October _ elderly by tennis standards _ but with her
reputation as a choker finally eradicated, she may become a more
formidable force than ever.
	   ``If she doesn't win another match, it doesn't matter,''
Mandlikova said. ``But of course she'll keep playing and fighting.
I think she'll play for another two or three years. This is a huge
thing for her and will give her even more motivation.''
	   The future may belong to Hingis, Venus Williams and the rest of
tennis' teen-age vanguard, but Novotna and Tauziat, 30, proved that
there's still room at the top for a veteran.
	   ``I'm pleased about that,'' Tauziat said. ``It's important to
show them we're here. They have to realize everybody can play well,
whether you are young or older. Age has nothing to do with tennis
right now, especially on grass.''
	   Grass is Novotna's best surface, which is why she could continue
to be a threat at Wimbledon. Her athleticism and serve-and-volley
game have always been perfectly suited to the surface.
	   In Saturday's final, Novotna overcame a slow start to win the
first set, and she was the player with more poise in the second-set
tiebreaker.
	   Novotna caught a break when she drew the No. 16 seed in the
final, but her path to the championship was hardly easy. She
eliminated Williams in the quarterfinals and the top-ranked Hingis
in the semifinals.
	   ``To win a championship when you beat the No. 1 player in the
world, it makes it really special,'' Novotna said.
	   The Czech climbed from third to second behind Hingis in this
week's rankings, matching a career high.
	   ``No. 1 is not out of Jana's reach,'' said Pam Shriver, a BBC
commentator and former U.S. Open finalist. ``I really think she
should set that as her goal.''

Sampras back to his old super self at Wimbledon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ The only predictable thing about men's
tennis these days is that Pete Sampras is untouchable at Wimbledon.
	   For the past 12 months, the world's No. 1 player had been pretty
average. He lost to journeyman players, suffered from burnout and
failed to get past the quarters of the U.S., Australian or French
Opens.
	   So what happens when Sampras returns to Centre Court to defend
his title at the All England Club?
	   He becomes Superman again.
	   ``Now I guess I'm out of my slump,'' Sampras said after his 6-7
(7-2), 7-6 (11-9), 6-4, 3-6, 6-2 victory over Goran Ivanisevic in
Sunday's final, his fifth Wimbledon title in six years.
	   Two weeks on grass was enough to lift Sampras back to his
dominant best and elevate him a notch higher on the list of
all-time greats.
	   He tied Bjorn Borg for the most Wimbledon titles in the modern
era and moved within one victory of Roy Emerson's all-time record
of 12 Grand Slam championships, equalling Borg and Laver with 11.
	   If they played more Slams on grass, Sampras would surely be way
ahead by now.
	   ``I'm probably more comfortable on this court than any court in
the world,'' he said. ``With the surroundings, and the ball kids
and everything, it just seems like it's comfortable. It's like my
practice court. I've played a lot of big matches on that court and
when you're comfortable playing somewhere, you're going to play
well.''
	   No kidding. Since 1992, Sampras has won 44 matches and lost two
at Wimbledon.
	   ``If there's one thing that elevates my tennis, it's this place,
the court, the historical meaning that this tournament has to me as
a kid growing up,'' he said. ``It's not easy each week you play on
the tour to get motivated, and I have no problem getting motivated
for this one.''
	   Sampras was 8 years old when Borg won his fifth straight title
in 1980.
	   ``As a kid when I saw Borg's five, I never thought that I would
be a position to tie it,'' he said. ``It's a little overwhelming to
think about it.''
	   Sampras plans to savor this victory before thinking about going
after Emerson's mark.
	   ``When the U.S. Open comes around, I'll be thinking about trying
to achieve another goal,'' he said. ``But I feel like I've got a
lot of good years left in me, that I can do it, and it's a number
out there that I feel like I can achieve.''
	   Sampras' victory further enhanced his status as the greatest
player of his generation. Whether he is the greatest of all-time
remains a matter of debate.
	   ``I put him in the godlike stratosphere with Laver and Borg,''
former three-time champ John McEnroe said. ``You have to put those
people in the upper echelon. It's hard to say who is the best.''
	   Laver twice achieved the Grand Slam, sweeping all four majors in
the same year. Borg won the French Open six times, but never won
the U.S. or Australian Opens.
	   The knock on Sampras is that he has never won the French, the
only Grand Slam event played on clay. He's never been past the
semifinals in Paris, and last month lost in the second round to
little known Ramon Delgado.
	   In addition to his Wimbledon titles, Sampras has won the U.S.
Open four times and the Australian twice.
	   ``I guess it's possible to go a notch higher,'' McEnroe said.
``It would be more easy to argue he's the best if he won (the
French).''
	   For Ivanisevic, it may have been his best _ and last _ chance at
winning a major. Losing in his third Wimbledon final, after
previous defeats to Andre Agassi in 1992 and Sampras in 1994, was
heart-breaking for the 26-year-old Croatian.
	   ``It's the worst moment in my life,'' Ivanisevic said. ``I know
I've had some bad moments _ when you are sick or when somebody dies
_ but for me this is the worst thing ever. Nobody died yet, but
it's tough. Now I have to be motivated to play tennis again. I
don't know how long it's going to take.''
	   Sunday's match was a slugfest of brute force, with no rally
longer than eight strokes, a display of power tennis at its best _
or most tedious.
	   Ivanisevic served 32 aces, but also had 20 double faults.
Sampras had only 12 aces, but scored repeatedly with his big second
serve.
	   The match turned Sampras' way in the second-set tiebreaker, when
Ivanisevic twice missed backhand passing shots that would have put
him ahead two sets to love.
	   ``I felt the match slipping away in the breaker,'' Sampras said.
``I thought `God, this could be Goran's year.'''
	   Even after Sampras took the second and third sets, Ivanisevic
pushed him to the limit before wilting in the fifth.
	   ``Compared to all the finals I've played, this is by far the
toughest,'' Sampras said. ``It was just a couple of points here and
there. I was able to raise my level just a litle bit in the fifth
set. The next thing I knew I won the match. It was kind of a weird
feeling.''
	   And by now, a familiar one, too.
	   _ On Saturday, two-time runnerup Jana Novotna _ best remembered
for crying on the shoulder of the Duchess of Kent after losing in
the 1993 final _ won her first Grand Slam singles title by beating
Nathalie Tauziat 6-4, 7-6 (7-2).
	   Novotna came back Sunday to claim the women's doubles title,
teaming with Martina Hingis for a 6-3, 3-6, 8-6 win over Lindsay
Davenport and Natasha Zvereva.
	   _ Sixteen-year-old Serena Williams won the mixed doubles title
with Max Mirnyi of Belarus, defeating Mahesh Bhupathi of India and
Mirjana Lucic of Croatia 6-4, 6-4.
	   _ In men's doubles, Jacco Eltingh and Paul Haarhuis beat Todd
Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde 2-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7-3), 5-7, 10-8,
stopping the Australians' bid for a record sixth straight Wimbledon
title.

Goran finishes 2nd again at Wimbledon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs &QL; 
 &UR; By STEVEN WINE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ For Goran Ivanisevic, second-best
never felt worse.
	   The talented, temperamental Croatian is now 0-for-3 in Wimbledon
finals. He lost Sunday to Pete Sampras in a three-hour slugfest,
6-7 (7-2), 7-6 (11-9), 6-4, 3-6, 6-2.
	   ``I've had some bad moments, you know, when you are sick or when
somebody dies,'' Ivanisevic said. ``But for me, this is the worst
thing ever. Nobody died yet, but it's tough.''
	   Ivanisevic and Jana Novotna entered the finals trying to shake
labels as the most talented active players without a Grand Slam
title. Each had been a runnerup at Wimbledon twice previously.
	   The parallel ended there. Novotna won; Ivanisevic lost.
	   ``At this level, with Goran and me playing the way we do on
grass, it's not really much that separates us,'' Sampras said. ``I
got a little bit lucky, I must admit.''
	   Luck has rarely been part of Ivanisevic's game, at least not in
Wimbledon finals. He lost a five-setter to Andre Agassi in 1992. He
lost in straight sets to Sampras in 1994.
	   Now, the 26-year-old lefty with the booming serve can't be sure
whether he'll get another shot at a Wimbledon title _ or whether
he'll even try again.
	   ``This doesn't motivate me at all to come back,'' he said. ``I
don't know how long it's going to take, but I have to try.''
	   Others have suffered repeated frustrations on the Centre Court
grass. Ken Rosewall went 0-for-4 in Wimbledon finals, while Fred
Stolle finished second three consecutive years and never won the
title.
	   That was of no consolation to the 1998 runnerup.
	   Ivanisevic's shaky psyche held up well for most of the final. He
broke a racket in anger, complained about calls and chastised
himself in a voice audible 30 rows up. But he didn't unravel under
pressure the way he's done in the past.
	   ``I don't think it's mental,'' Sampras said. ``I think Goran was
pretty strong mentally today. He didn't get upset. In fact, he's
going to win this event, I feel. His game is too big, and his serve
is too big. He has come close three times now.''
	   But Ivanisevic again came up short at the most important
moments, squandering seven of nine break-point chances. His 32 aces
weren't enough; his 20 double faults were too many.
	   Ivanisevic fretted about failing to convert two set points in
the second-set tiebreaker, which allowed Sampras to even the match
at one set each.
	   ``I knew these two set points are going to my backhand, and I
missed them both, which is ridiculous,'' he said.
	   Instead, Ivanisevic fell behind, then tired after playing a
15-13 fifth set against Richard Krajicek in Friday's semifinals. He
won only three points in the final four games.
	   ``I gave everything in that fourth set, and then it was like
somebody hit me,'' he said.
	   He sailed a backhand long on match point, then met a jubilant
Sampras at the net. The conversation was brief.
	   ``What can you say? `Bad luck?' He doesn't want to hear that,''
Sampras said. ``He just probably wants to be left alone. I'm sure
this match will replay in his mind for many months.''
	   The replays began immediately. While waiting to accept the
consolation trophy, Ivanisevic sat for a long time in his courtside
chair with a towel draped over his head, talking to himself.
	   What did he say?
	   ``That's between me and me,'' he answered.
	   Later, even the mention of Croatia's World Cup victory Saturday
over Germany failed to brighten his mood.
	   ``I cannot cheer anybody now,'' he said. ``I can only kill
myself.''

World Cup: Bergkamp, Rivaldo lead chase to be new Pele, Maradona
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ There may be a Pele or a Maradona out there at the
World Cup after all. And it's not Ronaldo.
	   The World Cup has reached the semifinal stage and two players,
Dutch striker Dennis Bergkamp and Brazil's Rivaldo _ rather than
superstar Ronaldo _ look the closest to being the standout players
of the championship.
	   The two come into confrontation on the field when defending
titlist Brazil meets the Dutch in Tuesday's semifinal at the Stade
de France.
	   Both have scored three goals so far and, while Bergkamp is in
the Netherlands front line, Rivaldo strikes from deep.
	   Bergkamp, who has had a brilliant 12 months playing for English
club Arsenal, helping the team win a domestic league and cup
double, fired the Dutch into the semifinal with a goal either Pele
or Maradona would have been proud of.
	   Running onto a high, long-range pass from deep, he controlled it
expertly on his right foot, turned inside a defender and then
volleyed it, also with his right, past the keeper.
	   The game had only 32 seconds to go and the Dutch had knocked out
one of the favorites.
	   Rivaldo hit two goals in Brazil's 3-2 quarterfinal victory over
Denmark.
	   Running unchallenged from midfield, the Barcelona midfielder
took a pass from Ronaldo, stayed clear of the Dutch defense and
slid an angled shot past 'keeper Peter Schmeichel.
	   His second goal needed no help. Rivaldo collected the ball in a
huge space 30 meters from the Dutch goal and fired a low drive from
25 into the net for the winner.
	   Rivaldo also has impressed with his direct running at defenses,
dribbling past opponents and creating openings for others. It's
partly his influence that three other team-mates, Ronaldo, Cesar
Sampaio and Bebeto also have three goals each.
	   Ronaldo, by his high standards, is making less of an impact.
Coach Mario Zagallo, though anxious not to over-praise his biggest
star, applauded the Inter Milan striker for setting up two of his
team's goals against the Danes.
	   While Bergkamp, Rivaldo and Ronaldo are the biggest names among
the survivors along with Dutch winger Marc Overmars, Youri
Djorkaeff and Zinedine of France and Croatia's Davor Suker, others
were shining before their teams got knocked out.
	   Ariel Ortega, wearing the No. 10 shirt made famous by Diego
Maradona, repeatedly weaved past defenders to set up chances for
his colleagues. But his World Cup had a miserable end when he was
expelled for headbutting Dutch goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar as
Argentina was eliminated in a 2-1 loss.
	   Mexico's Luis Hernandez was always difficult to stop, with his
alertness in the area and his eye for goal chances.
	   He hit four goals and, if he had put away a fifth against the
Germans, his team may still have been in the competition.
Hernandez' close-range shot with the Mexicans leading 1-0 was
somehow blocked by keeper Andreas Koepke and the Germans came back
to win 2-1 before losing 3-0 to the Croats.
	   England's Michael Owen scored a stunning solo goal against
Argentina in the second round and, although his team was beaten in
a penalty shootout after a 2-2 tie, showed at age 18 he is a big
star of the future.
	   ``Owen is a real talent. He is one of the three players that
have impressed me most,'' said Maradona, who is giving his expert
analysis for Argentine TV.
	   ``He, Bergkamp and Rivaldo have all had an excellent World
Cup.''

Gullikson rushes home from Wimbledon; McEnroe rips Rios _ again

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ U.S. Davis Cup captain Tom Gullikson
had to pull out of the final in 45-and-over men's doubles so he
could return to Florida, where a wildfire is threatening his home.
	   Gullikson lives in Flagler County, which was evacuated because
of the fire. He flew back to Florida to be with his family on
Saturday, hours before the scheduled final.
	   ``All the reports we've been seeing from here have been from
Flagler County,'' said Gullikson's playing partner, Brian
Gottfried. ``As you can imagine, he was a little bit concerned.
Your priority is obviously your family.''
	   Sherwood Stewart and Marty Riessen won the title by walkover
against Gullikson and Gottfried.

	   MAC ATTACK: Three-time Wimbledon champion John McEnroe continues
being critical of the men's game _ particularly players who don't
give 100 percent, even in the Grand Slams.
	   ``How can these guys who make millions of dollars a year appear
to not care at Wimbledon?'' McEnroe said. ``It's embarrassing. I
hope and pray that changes soon, so that every time a tennis player
steps on the court, he feels an obligation to give 110 percent.''
	   McEnroe spoke specifically of second-seeded Marcelo Rios of
Chile, who lost in the opening round and then ripped Wimbledon as
``just another tournament.''
	   ``Rios has had a great year,'' McEnroe said. ``His problem is he
came in here and didn't give this the respect it deserved.''
	   Men's rankings will put more emphasis on Grand Slam results
beginning in 2000. McEnroe favors that change and also suggests
moving the service line closer to the net, making the serve
tougher.
	   ``It's a server's paradise,'' McEnroe said. ``Because of the
power, players don't volley as well, but they don't need to. Guys
are hitting rockets.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   WILLIAMS SISTERS CASH IN: Serena Williams, who pulled out in the
third round of singles with a calf injury while trailing Spain's
Virginia Ruano-Pascual, won the mixed doubles title Sunday with Max
Mirnyi of Belarus.
	   They defeated Mahesh Bhupathi of India and Mirjana Lucic of
Croatia, 6-4, 6-4. The win was worth 36,100 pounds (dlrs 59,900) to
the 16-year-old American.
	   Serena also picked up 13,650 pounds (dlrs 22,660) for reaching
the third round in singles.
	   Sister Venus Williams, 18, won 48,070 pounds (dlrs 80,000) for
making the quarterfinals in singles and 18,920 (dlrs 31,400) for
reaching the mixed doubles semifinals.
	   The two pulled out of women's doubles _ following Serena's
injury _ without playing a match.
	   Not a bad two week's work for the teen-agers.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SAMPRAS STAYS NO. 1: Under the ATP Tour's confusing ranking
system, Sampras had to win Wimbledon to keep his No. 1 ranking.
	   ``At this point, it's not about the ranking,'' Sampras said.
``It's about the titles.''
	   ``I mean,, this is historical, and that's more important than
the ranking.''
	   Sampras now has the best winning percentage in Grand Slam finals
of any player based on 10 titles won. The ranking: Sampras (11-2),
Roy Emerson (12-3), Bjorn Borg (11-5), Bill Tilden (10-5), Rod
Laver (11-6).
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SERVE AND VOLLEY: Jana Novotna on winning the women's doubles
with Martina Hingis after taking the singles title Saturday: ``I
don't think it can get any better than this next year,'' she said.
``I did well. I should celebrate more often, have this kind of
preparation just before a doubles final.''
	   Pete Sampras picked up 435,000 pounds (dlrs 722,000) and
runner-up Goran Ivanisevic got 217,500 (dlrs 361,000) for Sunday's
final.
	   John McEnroe on the difficulty of playing tennis on clay, the
only surface Sampras hasn't won on: ``It's a totally different
movement. Try wathcing the NBA finals on clay.''
	   McEnroe also picked Sampras to beat Roy Emerson's record of 12
Grand Slams: ``He doesn't play doubles, he doesn't play much Davis
Cup. His emphasis is on the Grand Slams, and I can certainly see
him breaking Emerson's record.''
	   Wimbledon semifinalist Tim Henman is one of three candidates for
the presidency of the ATP Tour Players' Council. Spain's Alex
Corretja recently stepped down. Other candidates are American Todd
Martin and Russia's Yevgeny Kafelnikov.

Three state elections key to Mexican presidential race

<TEXT>
	   CHIHUAHUA, Mexico (AP) _ In an election seen as a crucial test
for presidential elections in two years, voters were closely
divided in tightly contested governor races in northern Mexico,
exit polls showed.
	   In Chihuahua state, which borders Texas, the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, tried a new strategy to
recapture the governor's seat from the National Action Party and
launch a strong comeback after unprecedented election defeats.
	   The PRI abandoned the tradition of party leaders choosing
candidates and held a primary election in the state in March that
was open to all voters.
	   The winner, former Chihuahua Mayor Patricio Martinez, was in an
extremely tight race with Ramon Galindo of the center-right
National Action Party, according to an exit poll.
	   The poll by Azteca television network showed Martinez with 48
percent to 44 for Galindo. But a 5 percentage point margin of error
put the two in a statistical tie.
	   If Martinez wins, it will be the first time the PRI has
recaptured a lost governorship, and its only chance to do so before
the presidential elections in 2000. A PRI victory would also give
strength to those within the party who favor a national primary to
choose a presidential candidate.
	   Conversely, a National Action victory would increase that
party's momentum for upcoming presidential and gubernatorial races.
	   While scattered early returns were expected late Sunday night,
Mexico's complex vote-counting mechanism means definitive counts
were unlikely until Monday.
	   Also Sunday, in the historic mining center of Zacatecas state,
the PRI was facing a potentially embarrassing defeat.
	   The Azteca exit poll showed the Democratic Revolution candidate
Ricardo Monreal leading with 45 percent, followed by the PRI's Jose
Olvera Acevedo at 38 percent.
	   Monreal bolted from PRI after officials passed him over for the
gubernatorial nomination.
	   Although the leftist party had been a minor force in Zacatecas,
as throughout northern Mexico, a win by Monreal would be the
Democratic Revolution's first state-level victory since it won the
mayor's seat in Mexico City last year.
	   The PRI was expected to hang on to the governorship of Durango
state, which borders both Zacatecas and Chihuahua, according to an
Azteca exit poll, which gave the PRI 39 percent to 29 percent for
National Action.
	   Election officials said voter turnout in Chihuahua and Zacatecas
was high, but didn't provide figures. They said the turnout was
lower in Durango.
	   The PRI has held power in Mexico since 1929, but its grip is
slipping. Six state governorships, including the seat in Chihuahua,
have been won by National Action over the past decade.
	   Seven other governorships will be contested this year _ all are
now held by PRI.
	   Last year, the PRI lost its majority in the lower house of
Congress and was thrashed in the Mexico City mayor's race. PRI
governorships will be at risk in nine states before the
presidential election.

World Cup: Kluivert glad to be back in shop window
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTE-CARLO, Monaco (AP) _ Desperate for a transfer after a
troubled season at struggling Italian giant AC Milan, Patrick
Kluivert wanted to showcase his talents at the World Cup.
	   Instead, he put his fiery temper in the international spotlight
by elbowing Belgian defender Lorenzo Staelens in the Dutch World
Cup opener.
	   He redressed the balance with a goal Saturday against Argentina
and is hungry for more glory in a semifinal against Brazil on
Tuesday.
	   ``If you play well at the World Cup, everything goes a little
more smoothly,'' Kluivert said Sunday.
	   His name has been linked with a possible move to clubs including
Manchester United and Arsenal.
	   Forming a double-Dutch forward line with Dennis Bergkamp at
Arsenal would certainly appeal to Kluivert, although he refuses to
be specific about where he wants to go.
	   ``He can put the ball in the right spot where I want the ball,
in front of the goal,'' Kluivert said of Bergkamp. ``It is very
important to have such a good connection with a forward player and
that connection is very good with me and Dennis.''
	   The two linked perfectly for the Netherlands' first goal against
Argentina in the quarterfinal Saturday.
	   Stooping low, Bergkamp headed a Ronald de Boer pass directly
into Kluivert's path, leaving the 22-year-old to run into the
middle of the penalty area and place the ball past Argentine keeper
Carlos Roa from almost on top of the penalty spot.
	   However well he plays in the remainder of the World Cup, it is
still not certain he will be leaving Milan, which has put a
reported dlrs 17.5 million price tag on Kluivert.
	   Clubs may be reluctant to invest heavily in a talented but
mercurial player, who shot to fame and then fell from grace in one
turbulent year.
	   Kluivert scored the only goal in Ajax Amsterdam's 1-0 victory
over AC Milan in the 1995 European Champions Cup final, but later
the same year he crashed a borrowed BMW into another car in
Amsterdam, killing the other car's driver.
	   An Amsterdam court convicted him of vehicular homicide and
sentenced him to community service.
	   Earlier this year, controversy again struck when a young woman
accused Kluivert and a group of his friends of raping her. He was
never charged and this week he was awarded legal costs in the case.
	   But Kluivert insists he is learning from the setbacks and from a
slump in form this season in Italy.
	   ``At Ajax everything went well ... now I have the idea that I
have to work twice as hard,'' he said.
	   During his two-match suspension for elbowing Staelens in the
Belgium game, Kluivert impressed Dutch coach Guus Hiddink with his
commitment and positive attitude in training.
	   ``He kept working hard and showed he really wanted a starting
place,'' Hiddink said.
	   Kluivert finally got his reward with a spot among the first 11
against Argentina and made the most of it. His goal came in just
the 12th minute.
	   ``I hadn't played for three games so I was fresh,'' he said.

World Cup: France's camp is castle others can only dream about
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CLAIREFONTAINE, France (AP) _ For the French World Cup hosts,
their home is literally their castle. The team has made a castle
their home.
	   ``This is where we feel good,'' said French coach Aime Jacquet,
walking from the training field to the stone mansion where he and
his players have been living for more than a month.
	   With tension in the host nation getting higher ahead of
Wednesday's semifinal against Croatia, a secluded hideaway is a
necessity.
	   Smack in the middle of the vast Rambouillet forest some 50
kilometers (30 miles) southwest of the capital, it is a haven of
peace and quiet where deer still roam free among the green hills
and boar sometimes venture onto the training fields.
	   A long avenue of rhododendrons, one purple haze until a week
ago, leads straight into the heart of the 58 hectare (145-acre)
base. French great Michel Platini, who has chief training pitch
named after him, simply calls it ``the house of French soccer.''
	   In the bowels of the vast complex, the team doctors have the
latest in sports medical equipment at their disposal and the
players go from gym centers to the massage tables to their
personalized rooms all within one swoop.
	   In an adjacent building, a vast book and video library has
everything on every potential opponent at the disposal for Jacquet,
who had an office down the hall.
	   It even has its own computer center that tracks the performances
of every French player and opponents, a vital tool in preparing
tactical plans.
	   ``We should be so lucky to have all this at our disposal,'' said
Jacquet. ``We're in a great facility.''
	   Although World Cup lodgings for visiting teams have come a long
way over the past dozen years, when some teams still shared hotels
in noisy environments, a cozy base like this is a definite
advantage.
	   Little wonder France wanted to win its first round. Victory
assured the team that the last three would be played in
Saint-Denis, if it plays the final, or Saint-Denis and Paris, if it
loses the semifinal. The two stadiums are an easy commute from
Clairefontaine.
	   Over the weekend, some players went mountain biking into the
hills, others went running at ease through the woods to recover
from Friday's exhausting quarterfinal win over Italy.
	   ``In Clairefontaine, we find the time to get all our forces
back,'' said Jacquet.
	   The training center has nine soccer fields and can lodge over
400 people. Most of the time, France's finest youngsters converge
on Clairefontaine for special sessions and when the soccer players
were out of town for a first-round game, Alain Prost's Formula One
team came over to prepare the French Grand Prix.
	   Direct contact with the public is lacking though. Training
sessions are closed to the general public and, just ahead of the
games, to journalists too.
	   When Brazilians or Nigerians were signing autographs for flocks
of fans after training, the only contact the French have are with
properly accredited media. It is a rare day when a fan stands
outside the gate.
	   The French soccer federation bought the chateau from
international banker Andre Lazard in 1982 and have used proceeds
from several World Cup campaigns to renovate the center.
	   Now it could house the first French world champions.

World Cup: Germans blame referee for failure
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NICE, France (AP) _ It was anything but a graceful exit.
	   As the German players began leaving their Cote d'Azure
headquarters, separately and in groups, coach Berti Vogts was still
blaming the referee for Germany's stunning 3-0 loss to Croatia in
the World Cup quarterfinals.
	   ``There have been some very peculiar decisions against the
German team. Maybe there were some instructions. Perhaps the German
soccer was too successful and now had to be punished,'' Vogts said
Sunday about the refereeing.
	   ``I don't want to talk about the referee, especially not this
one,'' he added.
	   Norwegian referee Rune Pedersen of Norway sent off Germany's
best defender Christian Woerns in the 40th minute for a foul on
Croatian striker Davor Suker.
	   Lothar Matthaeus, the 37-year-old veteran, said FIFA was
sometimes assigning referees to World Cup matches who officiated
only ``second-rate'' matches at home.
	   Instead of blaming the referee, the Germans might be better off
taking an honest look at their glaring weaknesses.
	   The team was over the hill, with an average age of just under
30. What is more worrying for the three-time World Cup champion is
that Vogts really had no choice: the Bundesliga doesn't offer
better players.
	   The defense was anything but solid. The midfield virtually
non-existent. Even the usually stoically reliable Andy Koepke was
below par in the goal.
	   Juergen Klinsmann and Oliver Bierhoff scored three goals apiece
to keep Germany alive through the early games. They made the best
out of their chances, which were not many. They were the only ones
who did their job.
	   The Germans work soccer, other leading nations play it.
Technically, the Germans are behind other leading nations.
	   With Klinsmann and possibly up to seven players retiring, the
Germans face an uncertain future. There are few outstanding young
players in the Bundesliga like Michael Owen in England.
	   Germany will now focus on defending its European title in 2000.
But titles may be out of its reach form some time.
	   ``We'll have to set our standards lower,'' former star and
national team coach Franz Beckenbauer told German television.
``Times will get even tougher for us.''
	   Vogts said a radical reshuffle will have to follow.
	   ``We need a new beginning, we'll have to make a big cut. We want
to defend our European title in 2000.''
	   ``We'll have to sit down and analyze the situation without
emotion, in tranquility,'' Vogts said.
	   ``I'll be thinking about rebuilding the team without rushing
myself, but I must have the players necessary for that.''
	   Vogts wants to push through a program that would require all
Bundesliga teams to start two German Under-23 players, something he
admits will be hard to do in face of club opposition.
	   The coach says the influx of foreign players is preventing
German talents from blossoming.
	   A new-look Germany will start European Championship
qualifications Oct. 10 against Turkey.
	   ``Don't be surprised if some players who are not starters in
their clubs are nominated in the national team,'' Vogts said.

World Cup: Croatia cherishes outsider status also in semis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VITTEL, France (AP) _ Croatia's coach admits his team is the
outsider in its semifinal against France. Then again, he likes it
that way.
	   Miroslav Blazevic delighted in proving the doubters wrong with
Croatia's stunning 3-0 quarterfinal victory over Germany. He says
there's no reason to stop there.
	   ``This is a surprise only for people who are ignorant,'' the
Croatian coach said Sunday. ``Of course, we benefited from the
outsider's role to surprise some favorites. Nobody paid any
attention to us. When we play, we rebel against this attitude.''
	   No stranger to cocky predictions, the wily 63-year-old coach has
told anyone who would listen that Croatia could make the final. Now
the small soccer-mad country on the Adriatic is only one step away.
It has already made World Cup history as the first debutant to
reach the final four.
	   Even Blazevic, who has coached clubs in France, rates the host
nation _ and not his own _ the top title contender.
	   But after watching the French struggle to defeat Italy on
penalty kicks in its quarterfinal, he said he is convinced they are
beatable, too.
	   ``I am too ambitious to say we have achieved everything we
can,'' Blazevic said after his triumphant squad returned to its
training camp in this idyllic spa town from Saturday's triumph over
Germany in Lyon.
	   Wednesday's semifinal in Paris is likely to be the toughest test
yet of Croatia's defense, which appeared tight under German
pressure until a red card for defender Christian Woerns shortly
before halftime tipped the quarterfinal in Croatia's favor.
	   To come off the patriotic euphoria that pushed them to new
heights against Germany, the Croatian players relaxed at the local
mineral baths Sunday.
	   ``The hot springs do wonders for my players,'' allowed Blazevic.

Items on David Beckham's wedding; shootout debate; Glenn Hoddle's

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ David Beckham may be unpopular after being blamed
for England's World Cup elimination. But newspapers and magazines
are prepared to pay up to 1 million pounds (dlrs 1.67 million) for
exclusive coverage of his wedding to Spice Girl Victoria Adams.
	   Beckham was shown the red card for needlessly aiming a
retaliatory kick at an Argentina opponent in the second round. That
left England to play 75 minutes with only 10 players. Argentina
advanced 4-3 on penalties after a 2-2 tie.
	   The 23-year-old Manchester United midfielder plans to wed Posh
Spice next summer and the bidding has started for media coverage of
the event.
	   ``We are in negotiations over the wedding. Whichever magazine or
paper gets it, it will be a dream come true,'' said Martin
Townsend, acting editor of OK! magazine.
	   ``We have paid large amounts in the past to Michael Jackson and
others and would do so again if it was merited.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ The shootout still doesn't captivate everybody, and
soccer's leaders are looking at possible alternatives to deciding
World Cup draws with a series of penalty kicks.
	   The one receiving the most attention would provide for a
30-minute extra time period followed by a shootout, FIFA spokesman
Keith Cooper said Sunday. If both teams scored in extra time and
the match still ended in a draw, and each team converted the same
number of penalties, then the victory would go to whichever team
scored first in extra time.
	   ``It gives the team that scores first the advantage because the
other team then would have to score at least twice,'' Cooper said.
	   If nobody scored in extra time, the old method of breaking the
tie with alternate penalty kicks would apply.
	   Other plans that have been considered and rejected included a
shootout followed by extra time, and even a penalty kick shootout
before the game starts.
	   Shootouts have been in the rules to decide drawn matches in the
single-elimination or knockout phase of the Cup since 1978, and
were first used in 1982.
	   The 1994 World Cup was the first in which the final was decided
via a shootout, with Brazil beating Italy. And this year's
tournament is the first involving sudden-death or ``Golden Goal''
overtime, with France winning the only one so far over Paraguay in
the second round. There also have been two shootouts, with
Argentina beating England in the second round and France topping
Italy to reach the semifinals.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ England coach Glenn Hoddle doesn't want to talk
about the next World Cup just yet.
	   After his team went out to Argentina in a second round penalty
shootout, Hoddle was approached by English Football Association
chairman Keith Wiseman to negotiate terms for World Cup 2002.
	   ``The next World Cup is too far ahead for me to consider at the
moment,'' said Hoddle, whose contract ends after the European
Championship in 2000.
	   ``There is a lot of water to pass under the bridge before then.
I want to keep my options open.
	   ``I don't see any reason for (the FA) or me to change the
situation. If the agreement was coming to an end then it would be
different.''

Ignition, liftoff: McGwire set for launch
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TOM WITHERS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ Imagine the NBA holding a slam-dunk contest on a
9-foot (3-meter) hoop or golfers playing the U.S. Open on a par-3
course.
	   That's what Monday's All-Star Home Run Derby will be like with
some of baseball's biggest sluggers launching balls in this
high-elevation city.
	   ``To me, that's going to be the highlight of this whole All-Star
Game,'' said San Diego's Tony Gwynn.
	   In this, the Year of the Homer in baseball, there is no more
fitting venue to host St. Louis' Mark McGwire and the other
long-ball contestants than Coors Field, where more homers have been
hit the past two seasons than in any other major league ballpark.
	   The lineups had not yet been completed Sunday for the event,
which for the first time will be televised in prime time, but among
the most likely participants are: McGwire, Atlanta's Chipper Jones
and Andres Galarraga, and Colorado's Vinny Castilla for the NL;
Seattle's Alex Rodriguez, Cleveland's Jim Thome, Detroit's Damion
Easley, Baltimore's Rafael Palmeiro and Anaheim's Darin Erstad in
the AL.
	   Ken Griffey Jr. of the Seattle Mariners, leading the AL in
homers, announced last month that he would skip this year's event
because it messes with his swing. And the Cubs' Sammy Sosa, who set
a record with 20 homers in June, had to pull out Sunday with a sore
left shoulder.
	   Still, Sosa was planning to attend the festivities in Denver as
a spectator.
	   ``You know me, I want to be there,'' he said. ``I'll be there
watching McGwire.''
	   McGwire should test the laws of gravity and may crush the
stadium record for the longest homer, a 496-shot belonging to Mike
Piazza. In fact, some of the restaurants and art galleries
surrounding Coors Field may want to board up some windows with Big
Mac coming to town.
	   And although Sosa and Griffey _ who with McGwire will be chasing
Roger Maris' record of 61 homers _ won't be participating, the St.
Louis first baseman was looking forward to his sixth home-run
contest.
	   ``I've enjoyed it. I think that's probably the best part of the
All-Star game,'' he said. ``Everybody has their own opinions about
it, but I enjoy it. I'm sure they have their reasons (for pulling
out).''
	   Before the homers start flying on Monday, NL manager Jim Leyland
and the AL's Mike Hargrove will announce their lineups and starting
pitchers for the 69th All-Star game. Atlanta's Greg Maddux (12-2)
is expected to be Leyland's choice while Yankees left-hander David
Wells (11-2) may get the nod from Hargrove.
	   Also on Monday, four teams _ each made up of a celebrity, a
major league rookie and a retired All-Star _ will compete in a new
event, the MCI Hitting Challenge. Denver Broncos quarterback John
Elway, actor Kevin Costner, George Brett, Andre Dawson, Dave
Kingman and Robin Yount are some of the participants.
	   They'll serve as a prelude to the big boys, who'll be taking aim
at the Rockpile, a section of seats in deep, straightaway center
field.
	   ``I had a great time last year,'' Jones said. ``I'll go out and
embarrass myself again. I know I'm not going to win but I'll sure
go out and try to hit one in the third deck.''

Gonzalez tops century mark for RBIs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) _ Juan Gonzalez hit a pair of two-run
homers Sunday night to become the second player to top 100 RBIs
before the All-Star break.
	   Gonzalez homered in the first and seventh innings off Seattle's
Randy Johnson to improve his major league-leading RBI total to 101.
	   The Texas right fielder has the second-most RBIs before the
All-Star break in major league history. Hank Greenberg of the
Detroit Tigers had 103 in 1935 en route to 170.
	   It was the 10th time this season that Gonzalez has driven in
four or more runs in a game this year.
	   Gonzalez is ahead of Hack Wilson's record pace of 1930 when
Wilson drove in 190 runs for the Chicago Cubs. Wilson had 89 RBIs
after 87 games.
	   The two home runs gave Gonzalez 26 on the season and his 31st
multi-homer game of his career.

Hyundai autoworkers begin two-day strike
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo Planned

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Unionized workers at Hyundai Motor Co.
began a two-day strike Monday, their second walkout in a week to
protest company plans to lay off 4,830 employees.
	   The union said it will call a bigger strike later unless South
Korea's largest car maker retracts its layoff plan. Hyundai workers
staged a one-day strike last week.
	   ``There is no alternative but to increase our protest,'' union
leader Kim Kwang-shik said at a rally of 10,000 workers at the
company's main plant in Ulsan, 200 kilometers (125 miles) southeast
of Seoul.
	   Kim said the company had rejected a union proposal to cut work
hours instead of laying off workers. Company officials called the
union's proposal ``a makeshift measure.''
	   The company said layoffs were necessary because of sluggish
sales. Hyundai, capable of producing 1.65 million cars a year, was
operating at 40 percent of its capacity, it said.
	   ``We have more than 10,000 surplus workers on the payroll. How
can the company survive without layoffs?'' a company official said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Car sales have dropped by more than 50 percent so far this year
as South Koreans keep tightening their belts in the midst of a
sharp economic downturn.
	   In May, Hyundai announced plans to lay off 8,189 surplus
workers. It has since shed 3,359 workers by offering them bigger
retirement packages.
	   On June 29, the company notified the government's Labor Ministry
of its plan to lay off the remaining 4,830, a process required by
law.
	   Hyundai was the first to resort to mass layoffs in a country
where workers are accustomed to lifetime employment _ a tradition
being shattered by Asia's economic crisis. Other Korean automakers
are expected to follow suit.
	   The Korean Automakers' Association said in a report last week
that South Korean auto firms will have to cut production in half
later this year and lay off 16,000 workers.
	   It will be the first production cut since South Korea began
producing cars in the 1970s.
	   South Korea is the world's fifth largest carmaker. Until an an
economic crisis struck late last year, the country's automakers had
been borrowing and expanding at a rapid pace, with the hope of
turning out 5 million cars annually by 2000.

Dollar higher, Tokyo stocks fall at midday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with midday stock, bond and currency prices &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen Monday morning
on receding hope the Japanese government will announce major tax
cuts to spur the economy. Japanese stock prices fell moderately.
	   The dollar bought 140.42 yen as of midday, up 1.18 yen from late
Friday in Tokyo. Financial markets in New York were closed Friday
for the U.S. Independence Day holiday.
	   The yen weakened following comments from top government
officials which seemed to backpedal on earlier suggestions that
permanent tax cuts would be implemented.
	   Speaking on national television Sunday, Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto said while his government would debate permanent reforms
to Japan's income tax system, there might not be any net reduction
in the country's tax burden.
	   On Monday, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Teijiro Furukawa told
reporters Hashimoto did not specifically pledge permanent tax cuts
Friday in a widely-reported speech.
	   He also said Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi misspoke Saturday
when he promised U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright that
Japan would adopt permanent tax cuts.
	   The tax-cut talk comes amid fierce campaigning ahead of July 12
elections to the upper house of Parliament.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, meanwhile, the 225-issue Nikkei
Stock Average shed 22.73 points, or 0.13 percent, to 16,488.51 as
of midday. The Nikkei index had gained 39.66 points, or 0.24
percent, on Friday, for its eighth straight rise.
	   Many investors retreated to the sidelines on Monday to monitor
developments regarding tax cuts.
	   ``Investors want to see in what way a tax cut is implemented,''
said Setsuo Nagao, a manager in the stock trading division of Tokyo
Securities.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 3.16 points, or 0.25 percent, to 1,265.20.
The TOPIX closed down 2.10 points, or 0.17 percent on Friday.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.320 percent from Friday's finish of 1.340 percent,
driving its price up to 111.04 yen from 110.90 yen.

What China gained from summit: chance to show change to U.S.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RENEE SCHOOF &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Wowing President Bill Clinton with its culture
and rapid modernization was the easy part. What China really needed
from the president's trip was to send a message to the American
people.
	   That message _ the image of a changing, open and cooperative
country _ was meant to reach members of the U.S. Congress who
oppose better relations. China needs friendship with the United
States to eliminate obstacles to its two main goals: economic
growth and reunification with Taiwan.
	   One key ingredient in creating a new image was an unprecedented
burst of openness. For the first time Chinese saw President Jiang
Zemin on live TV debating a world leader on the 1989 Tiananmen
Square crackdown and other topics normally too sensitive for the
government-controlled news media.
	   Yet all the problems bedeviling U.S.-China relations remain.
Beijing announced no plans to address concerns on human rights,
Tibet, and a dlrs 50 billion trade imbalance.
	   ``The trip enabled people in the United States and China to pay
more attention to China-U.S. relations. This is especially
important for the American people to understand what's going on in
China, because they have a lot of input in the policy making of the
U.S. government,'' said Jia Qingguo, a U.S. expert at Peking
University.
	   ``In the past, there's been a lot of propaganda, prejudice and
misunderstanding of what's going on here,'' added Jia, who earned
his Ph.D. at Cornell University in New York.
	   U.S.-China relations were derailed in 1989 when China's military
violently crushed the democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square.
	   Throughout the 1990s, as China repaired and strengthened ties
with other countries around the world, relations with the United
States remained tense over human rights, trade disputes and
suspicions that China was leaking nuclear and missile technology.
	   In 1996, China conducted war games and tested missiles near
Taiwan, the island it claims as a rebel province. The United States
sent two aircraft carriers near the island to warn Beijing against
going too far.
	   The summit in Beijing symbolized that relations with the United
States are finally friendly, said Zhang Yebai of the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences.
	   ``The United States is the most important of all foreign
relationships for China,'' Zhang said. ``If relations with the
United States are bad, the Taiwan problem is very troublesome, and
economic growth is, too, because the United States could withhold
trade privileges and investment.''
	   To ease Chinese concerns, Clinton reiterated that Washington did
not back independence for Taiwan.
	   He also expressed disappointment that more progress wasn't made
on opening the relatively closed Chinese market. And he argued on
behalf of universal human rights, saying the protection of
individual freedoms would promote stability and development.
	   China appeared more open during the visit.
	   In addition to the news conference by the two presidents, a
speech by Clinton at Peking University also was broadcast live.
	   The live coverage ``gave many people in the United States, not
just those who care about China, a picture of China different from
the one they imagined. With that kind of China in mind, there can
be a basis for post-Cold War cooperation with China,'' said Yan
Xuetong, a U.S. expert at the China Institute of Contemporary
International Relations.
	   ``For the Chinese who saw the broadcasts, they can see their new
government is very confident,'' he added. ``In China it improved
the relations between the people and the government. The Chinese
people now have more confidence and trust in their government.''
	   In discussing human rights and Chinese rule over Tibet in his
news conference with Clinton, Jiang made no concessions, although
he succeeded in brightening the atmosphere.
	   Jiang offered ``nothing new, but at least it was a different
tone altogether, more positive and forward-looking,'' said Tempa
Tsering, a spokesman for the Dalai Lama's Tibetan government in
exile in India.
	   For families of imprisoned dissidents, the summit sent no clear
signals.
	   ``Clinton came to China, and then left, but we haven't heard any
news,'' said Wu Huifen, 82, whose son, veteran labor activist Liu
Nianchun, has been held in labor camps and prisons without charge
for three years.

Bankrupt Kia Motors to be put up for international bidding
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Bankrupt Kia Motors Corp., South
Korea's third largest automaker, will be put up for international
auction next week, its main creditor bank said Monday.
	   The state-run Korea Development Bank, which has nearly dlrs 1
billion in non-performing loans to Kia, said it will call for bids
on July 15.
	   The successful bidder will be chosen by the end of August, it
said.
	   Daewoo Motors Co., South Korea's second largest auto firm, said
it will form a consortium with industry leader Hyundai Motors Co.
to bid for Kia. Another possible bidder is Ford Motor Co. of the
United States, which already owns l6.9 percent of Kia.
	   Kia is under court receivership after going bankrupt almost a
year ago. It produced 780,000 cars in 1997.
	   Local media, quoting unidentified sources, said the government
will offer various financial incentives to bidders, including a 20
percent reduction in Kia's debts.
	   The move to sell Kia is the latest in the government's efforts
to restructure the nation's economy under the terms of a dlrs 58
billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund.

Japan's imported vehicle sales drop more than 25 percent in June
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sales of imported vehicles in Japan plummeted more
than 25 percent in June from the same month last year for the 15th
straight month of decline, the Japan Automobile Importers
Association said Monday.
	   In a sign of sluggish demand due to Japan's prolonged economic
slump, sales of imports during the month slid 25.5 percent to
23,982 vehicles, most of which were passenger cars, the association
said.
	   Sales of vehicles produced in the U.S. plunged 50.7 percent to
3,645 units, with Chrysler, Ford and General Motors all suffering
double-digit declines.
	   German-made vehicle sales in June fell 13.3 percent to 13,371.
	   For the first six months of the year, sales of imported cars,
trucks and buses dropped 28.7 percent to 138,836 vehicles from the
previous year, it said.

Yankees beat Orioles 1-0, for sixth straight win

 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to add late games &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ David Cone became the second 12-game winner in
the American League as the New York Yankees matched the best
81-game start in major league history with a 1-0 victory over the
Baltimore Orioles on Sunday.
	   New York won its sixth straight, 10th in the last 11 games and
improved to 61-20 matching the record of the 1902 Pittsburgh
Pirates and the 1907 Chicago Cubs.
	   Cone (12-2) allowed seven hits in eight innings and struck out
four. He did not issue a walk for the third straight start. Mariano
Rivera got his 22nd save.
	   The Yankees scored the only run in the third when Scott Erickson
(8-7) hit Chad Curtis with the bases loaded.
 &UR; Blue Jays 2, Devil Rays 1 &QC; 
	   In Toronto, Roger Clemens struck out seven to become only the
11th pitcher to get 3,000 strikeouts as the host Blue Jays swept
the three-game series.
	   Clemens, who got a no-decision, allowed one run and five hits in
7 1-3 innings, leaving after allowing consecutive walks to Quinton
McCracken and Wade Boggs. He has 3,002 strikeouts in his career.
	   Tony Fernandez hit an RBI single in the eighth of Rock White
(1-4) to give the Blue Jays a 2-1 lead.
	   Paul Quantrill (1-3) got the win and Randy Myers pitched the
ninth for his 23rd save.
 &UR; Red Sox 15, White Sox 14 &QC; 
	   In Boston, John Valentin's RBI single broke a seventh-inning tie
and the Red Sox recovered after blowing an eight-run lead.
	   Troy O'Leary had four hits and Valentin, Mike Benjamin and
Darren Bragg each had three for Boston, which has scored 15 runs
three of its last four games.
	   Carlos Reyes (1-0) earned the victory, pitching a scoreless
seventh before putting two on with no out in the eighth. Tom Gordon
got his 25th save despite allowing a three-run homer to Wilfredo
Cordero in the eighth.
	   Bob Howry (0-1) took the loss, but the real damage was done by
Chicago starter Jaime Navarro, who allowed eight runs on nine hits
in two-plus innings.
 &UR; Indians 12, Royals 3 &QC; 
	   In Kansas City, Missouri, Manny Ramirez hit two home runs for
the second time in three days, including a grand slam in a six-run
sixth inning, to lead Cleveland.
	   All-Star first baseman Jim Thome and David Bell also homered and
Travis Fryman had four hits for the Indians.
	   Ramirez's 10th career two-homer game backed Cleveland starter
Jaret Wright, who was ejected in the seventh inning after throwing
a pitch over the head of Larry Sutton. Wright (8-5) allowed just
three hits and two runs in six-plus innings.
	   Glendon Rusch (6-10) took the loss.
 &UR; Twins 5, Tigers 4 &QC; 
	   In Minneapolis, LaTroy Hawkins struggled but won his first game
in three weeks, as host Minnesota salvaged the final game of their
three-game series.
	   Todd Walker hit his seventh homer off Brian Moehler (8-6) and
Ron Coomer drove in two runs for the Twins, who enter the All-Star
break in second place in the AL Central, 10 1/2 games behind
Cleveland.
	   Hawkins (5-8) allowed seven hits and four runs _ three earned _
in five innings, working out of a two-on, one-out jam in the fifth
to gain the win. Rick Aguilera pitched the ninth for his 18th
save.
 &UR; Athletics 5, Angels 4
	   In Anaheim, California, Kevin Mitchell homered in the eighth to
the game and walked with the bases loaded in the ninth to force in
the winning run as the Oakland Athletics beat the Anaheim Angels
5-4 Sunday.
	   Ryan Christenson led off the ninth with a double off Trop
Percival (1-3). After Rickey Henderson walked, Bournigal sacrificed
the runners to second and third. Percival intentionally walked Ben
Grieve, before walking Mitchell on a 3-2 pitch to score the winning
run.
	   It was the fourth straight win for Oakland, which swept the
Angels in Anaheim for the first time since 1991. The Angels have
lost five straight but head into the All-Star break atop the AL
West.
	   Mitchell had tied it at 4 when he led off the eighth with his
first homer of the year. Mitchell connected off Angels starter
Chuck Finley, ending his career-long stretch of 122 at-bats without
a homer.
	   Mike Fetters (1-2) pitched 1 2-3 scoreless innings for the
victory. Billy Taylor pitched the ninth for his 18th save.

 &UR; Rangers 8, Mariners 4
	   In Arlington, Texas, Juan Gonzalez hit a pair of two-run homers
to boost his major league-leading RBI total to 101 at the All-Star
break as Texas beat Seattle.
	   Gonzalez has the second-most RBIs before the All-Star break in
major league history. Hank Greenberg of the Detroit Tigers had 103
in 1935 en route to 170.
	   He is also ahead of Hack Wilson's record pace of 1930 when
Wilson drove in 190 runs for the Chicago Cubs. Wilson had 89 RBIs
after 87 games.
	   Gonzalez homered in the first and seventh innings off Randy
Johnson (7-8), the 31st multi-homer game of his career. It was the
10th time this season he has driven in four or more runs in a game.
	   Xavier Hernandez (3-1) pitched 3 2-3 innings of two-hit
scoreless relief for the victory.

One miner killed, one injured in Australian mine collapse
</HEADLINE>

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Part of the ceiling of the Wallarah
coal mine near Newcastle collapsed Monday, killing one miner and
injuring another.
	   A 32-year-old man was trapped 1.2 miles (2 km) deep in the mine
for more than three hours before rescue officials reached him. He
was flown by helicopter to a Newcastle hospital suffering serious
leg injuries.
	   The colliery, about 55 miles (90 km) north of Sydney, is owned
and operated by Coal Operations Australia Ltd., a subsidiary of
Ingwe Coal Corp. Ltd. of South Africa.
	   A spokesman for New South Wales state Mineral Resources Minister
Bob Martin said mine inspectors are preparing a report on the
collapse.
	   ``At this early stage my understanding is that a five-meter
(16-foot) section of the underground Great Northern Seam collapsed
on miners while they were trying to secure the ceiling after
excavation,'' Martin said.
	   Meanwhile, two reports on the 1996 Gretley coal mine disaster
will be released Tuesday, one from the New South Wales coroner, the
other from a judicial commission of inquiry.
	   Four men drowned at Oakbridge Pty. Ltd.'s Gretley Colliery at
Wallsend in the Hunter Valley on Nov. 14, 1996, after an excavator
cut into a disused shaft filled with water.
	   The state government called the judicial inquiry two weeks later
after preliminary investigations revealed the disused shaft was not
shown on Department of Mineral Resources maps used by the industry.
