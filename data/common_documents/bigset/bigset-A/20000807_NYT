DEFENSE MAKES STOPS FOR PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ Ted Johnson again was able to take a close
look at the Patriots defense. The injured New England linebacker
had to sit out his second exhibition game in five days, but Johnson
likes what he has seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the defense has done well,'' Johnson said after Friday
night's 13-10 win over the Lions. ``The defense did a great job and
the mental errors were minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering how New England's starting offense brought out all
the horror pictures from the end of the 1999 season (in fact it was
close to being totally inept) the defense displayed how it will be
_ and must be _ the strength of the team this season. It is very
early, of course, but the question now is whether the Patriots'
defense will outscore the offense in 2000, as it did Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   As for individual defensive performances, free safety Tebucky
Jones again showed he is more comfortable at safety than at
cornerback. And Antonio Langham, given a chance to start at
cornerback, played decently in the 22 or so minutes the first unit
was on the field. The Lions, as expected, picked on Langham,
throwing four passes in his direction. The veteran, however, seemed
vastly improved from the lost cause he has been in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   But for Johnson, a promising note was that the defense was able
to hold its own against a huge and physical Lions offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some trouble against the run (Friday) night and they
schemed us with things we hadn't really seen,'' said Johnson.
``They stretched (the running game) a bit and we really hadn't seen
behemoths like that. So I'm glad we experienced it so when
Thanksgiving comes around'' _ when the Patriots again meet the
Lions in the Silverdome _ ``they won't shock us with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bill Belichick again was careful not to hand out too much
praise, saying the defense ``had its moments. We, fortunately, made
a couple of plays where we had the right call that matched up
fairly well with the play they had on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots returned the favor, scheming the Lions when Detroit
tried its passing game with woeful quarterback Mike Tomczak.
Detroit fans are universally fervent in their belief that starter
Charlie Batch (broken leg) can return soon after the regular season
starts. A safety blitz by Lawyer Milloy in the first quarter was
typical of Belichick's chess moves as Milloy caused a fumble when
he came in on Tomczak untouched.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we were OK on defense,'' Belichick said. ``We still
had a couple of breakdowns.''
</P>
<P>
   But they also made plays that took the ball away from the Lions,
including Milloy's perfectly timed blitz and end Willie McGinest
causing another Tomczak first-quarter fumble. McGinest then read a
Lions screen pass, picked it off, and ran it back 49 yards for the
Patriots' lone touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the kind of defense that anybody wants, a big-play
defense,'' said McGinest. ``And that's what we're trying to do,
cause those turnovers and make those big plays to give the offense
the ball deep in their territory. Nine times out of 10, the offense
will score when you give 'em the ball down there.''
</P>
<P>
   McGinest was referring to the fumble Milloy caused that was
recovered by Chad Eaton at the Detroit 9-yard line. But 9 yards
proved to be too long a trek for the Patriots' anemic offense as
Drew Bledsoe threw a horrid interception in an attempt to find
triple-covered tight end Eric Bjornson in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Next time around, McGinest no longer trusted the odds of the
offense being able to score ``nine times out of 10'' that deep in
enemy territory. Instead, he took the turnover all the way to the
end zone himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ball disruption is what we're trying to do,'' said McGinest.
``That's our main goal.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite that goal being achieved against the Lions, several
defenders noted there is still much work to do. Milloy called the
Patriots' effort ``a humbling game for us right now considering
what we came off last (Monday). We know there's room for a lot of
improvement. We definitely have to go out and clean up some
things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early to tell how good we are,'' said McGinest.
``It's just preseason and everybody is not healthy. Everybody is
not playing. The other teams aren't running their full offensive
packages. We look good, but it's still too early.''
</P>
<P>
   Early or not, half the Patriots team looks good. Perhaps good
enough to carry the other half.

FORCE BEHIND GORE'S PLATFORM IS 25-YEAR-OLD VALLEY GUY &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ALEXA HAUSSLER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Growing up in Southern California's San Fernando
Valley, Andrei Cherny had such a passion for politics he worked in
Michael Dukakis' 1988 presidential campaign when he was only in
eighth grade.
</P>
<P>
   Now 25, Cherny is a senior speech writer for Vice President Al
Gore, as well as being a law student, author and spokesman for the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   And he is the primary author of the massive party platform that
will stake out a wide array of Democratic positions at next week's
national convention in his home town.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard graduate grew up in a middle-class household in Los
Angeles with his Czechoslavakian immigrant parents _ his father is
an elementary schoolteacher and his mother is a psychotherapist _
and he now divides his time between Washington, D.C., Los Angeles
and Berkeley, where he is a second-year law student.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting. In some ways I feel like I'm going to get a
chance to show off my city to all of the people I work with,'' he
said in an interview. ``I'm really proud that I'm going to be able
to show everybody the L.A. that I know.''
</P>
<P>
   Acquaintances said Cherny converses with some of the nation's
most powerful politicos with ease and opines as if he were a
veteran politician. California's state Assembly Speaker Bob
Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, counts him among his tight circle of trusted
advisers.
</P>
<P>
   They call him bright, poised and witty, with a dry sense of
humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time of his bar mitzvah, he was 13 going on 35,'' said
Valley Village Temple Adat Ari El Rabbi Moshe Rothblum, who has
known Cherny since he was 5. ``He was an absolutely unusual human
being since I've known him.''
</P>
<P>
   Cherny said it was his sixth-grade history teacher at Colfax
Avenue Elementary School in North Hollywood who sparked his
interest in politics.
</P>
<P>
   At 13, he arrived at the Dukakis campaign office and offered to
volunteer. After a brief stint vacuuming floors, he advanced by the
end of the summer to stuffing envelopes and calling voters.
</P>
<P>
   He was hooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was something I liked and something I wanted to keep
on doing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He stayed involved in Jewish youth groups and other activities
at North Hollywood High School. Then he attended Harvard
University, where he worked his way through college with the tips
he earned as a bartender, aided by loans and scholarships. He
confides that he may have been the ``world's worst bartender.''
</P>
<P>
   He admits he worked hard but hesitates to take all the credit
for his success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been pretty lucky along the way as well. A lot of people
work hard and never get the breaks and the chances that I've had,''
he said. ``It takes a combination of hard work and luck to
succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   His biggest break, he said, came when a top adviser to Bill
Clinton showed the president a column Cherny wrote for the Harvard
Crimson student newspaper. Impressed, the president personally saw
to it that the White House employed Cherny as a senior speechwriter
for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave the directive to hire me,'' Cherny said. ``It was a
very, very strange, surreal experience. I had no idea that any of
this was happening.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to writing the platform, Cherny currently is an
editor for the Democratic policy journal Blueprint, is attending
law school and working part-time advising Hertzberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't feel like you're working with a kid,'' Hertzberg
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are working with somebody with a very clear mind who has a
broad understanding of policy and good writing skills. He's always
willing to step forth with ideas, and he's not intimidated by
people who are twice his age sitting around the same table.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cherny exhibits some telltale signs of a twentysomething.
A movie buff, he loves ``Star Wars'' and ``Ferris Bueller's Day
Off.'' He has close groups of friends in the nation's capital and
in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``They treat me like Andrei, and, thankfully, politics rarely
comes up,'' he said. ``We have much more important things to
discuss when we're together _ the latest gossip.''
</P>
<P>
   Putting together the platform _ which focuses on the themes of
progress, prosperity and peace _ was ``a massive undertaking,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   After exhausting negotiations with citizen groups, labor unions
and business groups, he culled through 30,000 e-mails from
Americans with ideas for the platform. And he worked with top
Democrats to fuse an entire party's stance with the vision of Gore,
who will be nominated at the Aug. 14-17 convention at Staples
Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a platform that Democrats can be really proud of and
will really help them as they run from now until November,'' Cherny
said. ``I was really honored to be asked because I think it is an
important job and a chance to have an impact on a historical
document.''
</P>
<P>
   Working for the White House was stressful but fulfilled his
dreams. Still, Cherny said, the Valley and Los Angeles stayed in
his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to make sure I never forgot where I came from and that
I really was, hopefully, able to help the people I grew up with,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Valley in many ways represents what a lot of communities
all over the country are dealing with _ everything from education
to crime to health care. The concern that we have as families in
the Valley are ones that people everywhere are facing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that growing up in that environment has given me the
drive to try to address a lot of issues.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the future, Cherny said he wants to be a prosecutor. But
Rabbi Rothblum suspects Cherny was born for politics.
</P>
<P>
   Hertzberg drew no lines around Cherny's future: ``His future is
limited by his imagination.''

 RVs offer comforts of home, freedom of the road  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAMES HART  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OVERLAND PARK, Kan. _ Jerry and Carolyn Holloway recently
invited friends and family to kick the tires on their new house.
</P>
<P>
   Guests gathered in the parking lot at Overland Park Regional
Medical Center, where the 45-foot motor coach was parked. After
signing the guest book outside, they marveled at the mirrored
ceilings, Ultrasuede walls and granite floors within.
</P>
<P>
   RV sales have boomed nationwide, thanks to a strong economy and
baby boomers who want to see the country while they're still young
enough to enjoy the ride. This year, sales are expected to reach
about 330,000 vehicles, up 91 percent from 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The Holloways started traveling a few years ago, when workaholic
Jerry, then 55, retired. The Overland Park couple's new vehicle,
their third in nine years, cost as much as one /{very/} nice house
_ or several smaller, still-pretty-nice houses. ``I think it
surprises them that it's just like a home,'' Carolyn said of her
guests.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, RV sales are as strong as they've ever been,
according to the Recreation Vehicle Dealers Association. RV rentals
also are expected to rise by 21 percent this year, according to the
Recreation Vehicle Rental Association.
</P>
<P>
   Some leading manufacturers, though, are predicting hard times
ahead, blaming higher interest rates, higher gasoline prices and
surplus RVs on dealer lots. Stock prices have been dropping this
year for companies such as Fleetwood, down 39 percent, and National
RV, down 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of motor homes have dropped, but smaller truck campers,
certain trailers and other RVs are boosting the overall sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a pretty strong boom for the last three or four
years,'' said David Woodworth, a motor-camping historian and
collector who has made presentations at the Smithsonian
Institution.
</P>
<P>
   The motor home goes back decades. The first was built around
1910, said Woodworth, who once traveled in Mae West's 1931 motor
home. (It had a back porch and slept four.)
</P>
<P>
   Baby boomers are responsible for some of the gains. The average
RV owner is 48 years old with a spouse and an income of $47,000,
according to a study by the University of Michigan commissioned by
the RV industry. About one in four households led by 35- to
54-year-olds plans to buy an RV within three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it promotes good family togetherness,'' said Jim Frum,
the general manager of Olathe Ford's RV department.
</P>
<P>
   Frum has sold the vehicles since the mid-1970s. Even when the
economy was bad during the 1980s, RVs could still sell. And the
last few years have been better, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The vehicles on his lot range in cost from $5,000 to $257,000,
Frum said. (The Holloways asked that the price of their customized
vehicle not be included in this article, but it was substantially
more than the most expensive motor home on Frum's lot.)
</P>
<P>
   Because the Holloways travel about half the year, their motor
coach has all the comforts of home, including three televisions, a
satellite dish, a full stereo system and standard house appliances,
as well as a slide-out room.
</P>
<P>
   The vehicle gets a mileage only slightly better than a real
house, about eight miles per gallon. The tank holds 200 gallons of
diesel, so a fill-up costs a few hundred dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But the expense hardly bothers buyers, said Ross Naylor, who
owns a dealership in Kansas City. According to industry sources,
most people put only 5,000 to 6,000 miles on their RVs annually, so
travel is not cost prohibitive.
</P>
<P>
   The average motor home length is 34 to 36 feet, he said. Few are
longer than 40 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're looking for a lifestyle, and they've got everything in
that trailer that they have at home,'' Naylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Younger families usually buy smaller trailers, which are
comfortable but still retain the atmosphere of a campsite. Other
people buy motor homes _ ``rolling condominiums,'' as Naylor put it
_ but that loses the feel of camping, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The dealer, 57, lived in a travel trailer exclusively for five
years, starting when he was 45. He was based mostly in a Florida
park. If he felt like seeing the Florida Keys, away he went. The
following week he might get a yen for the mountains, so the trailer
would head north.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just adventure,'' Naylor said. ``Live on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Naylor recommends that people travel before they get too old.
The Holloways agree. ``We thought, we want to do it while we're
young enough to enjoy it,'' Carolyn Holloway said.
</P>
<P>
   The Holloways spend most of their trips at a resort in Arizona,
where Jerry golfs and Carolyn models clothing. They also have
roamed around good portions of North America. ``We've hit it all,''
Carolyn said. ``We've gone all over.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry's advice? Retire as early as possible. After all, he said,
you can always go back to work.
</P>
<P>
   But then, you can go anywhere in a 45-foot, mirrored-ceiling,
granite-floored, globally positioned motor home.

FATALITY ON `X-FILES' SET SHOWS HOLLYWOOD'S RISK TAKING &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LISA VAN PROYEN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The death of a crewman man and injuries to six
other people setting up a shoot for TV's ``The X-Files'' last week
have prompted movie industry officials to revisit just how safe TV
and film sets are.
</P>
<P>
   The accident _ when a metal rod held by a crew member setting up
scaffolding hit a high-voltage power line _ represents a worsening
trend of serious accidents on movie and TV sets and location
shoots.
</P>
<P>
   In the pursuit of more sophisticated and realistic movie and TV
shots, deaths have increased statewide, and the complaints among
employees in the Los Angeles market have increased in recent years,
although industry officials defend their safety record as better
than most employers'.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the stunts and the special effects demand more, we have
more injuries, lacerations, cut-off fingers, sprains and strains''
said Rana Platz-Petersen, the business representative for Local
767, the union that represents Motion Picture Studio First Aid
Employees.
</P>
<P>
   There were eight deaths in 1997, compared with seven in 1996 and
three each in 1995 and 1994, according statistics of the California
Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The number of
injuries doubled from 1994 to 1998, from 4,000 to 8,100 statewide.
</P>
<P>
   However, during that same time period, the number of motion
picture employees has also increased from 138,000 to 185,400.
</P>
<P>
   When you account for the higher number of employees, the motion
picture industry is ``below the average of all private industries
combined,'' said Victoria Heza, a deputy chief of enforcement for
Cal-OSHA, the state agency that investigates unsafe work conditions
and industrial accidents.
</P>
<P>
   For each 100 full-time employees in motion pictures, there were
1.5 people with injuries and illnesses on the set in 1998 and a
nearly equal 1.2 people in 1994, Heza said.
</P>
<P>
   Private industries, which include construction, manufacturing
and agriculture jobs, had an average of 3.2 injuries per 100
employees, vs. the motion picture industry with 1.4 injuries, Heza
said.
</P>
<P>
   Injury reports to Cal-OSHA are only required in cases of deaths,
amputations of any body parts or an injury that requires
hospitalization for more than 24 hours and for more than just an
observation.
</P>
<P>
   Critics in the industry, including the Screen Actors Guild,
point out that not all studios and productions report all injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I have a performer call and complain about an injury
and there's no report,'' said Sandi DeLoatch, an administrative
assistant to SAG's stunt and safety department.
</P>
<P>
   SAG's figures show that 64 people were injured in 1999, vs. 100
the year before. But those figures only include actors, stunt
performers and children _ not the technical and backup crews also
listed on movie credits.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those accidents occurred on location, rather than in a
studio, as was the case with Jim Engh, 38, of Chatsworth, who was
electrocuted while setting up scaffolding at a Century City
apartment complex on Monday. He was carrying a 20-inch-long steel
pipe that came in contact with a high power line.
</P>
<P>
   The Screen Actors Guild said most accidents happen during
filming, as opposed to during rehearsal or any other times.
</P>
<P>
   And the majority of the injuries result from falls, fight
sequences and trips and slips, according to guild statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The other problem, officials said, is some employees resist
reporting injuries out of fear they will not be called back to
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are all scared to death to talk to a regulatory agency,''
said Richard Eslava, a safety engineer who investigates injuries in
the entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stuntmen are the bane of my existence. ... The audiences
want more and more excitement and realism in movies. The problem
is, if the director says I want the stunt done and he says it's too
dangerous, the director will call somebody the next day to get
somebody who will do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Engh never complained about being injured on the job, his
brother David said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He once smashed his thumb with a hammer,'' his brother said.
But he never made an issue about any minor injuries he may have
suffered.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very confident that he knew what he was doing. And
probably 95 percent of the people he worked with, he was confident
in what they were doing,'' the brother said.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials said an increasing number of producers opt to
go without medical staffing, especially before the camera is
rolling and actors are on the set.
</P>
<P>
   This occurs despite a Cal-OSHA regulation that orders employers
to have a first aid provider at every job site to respond within
four minutes before paramedics arrive, said Hassan Adan, a district
manager for Cal-OSHA in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The producers don't want first aid. There have been two
proposals to eliminate us altogether,'' said Platz-Petersen of
Local 767, which provides union-operated first aid personnel for
producers.
</P>
<P>
   A Universal Studios source said producers there and at other
studios decide whether to hire trained medics on their sets on a
``case-by-case'' basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's based on the type of job, the number of people on the set
and the number and type of tools,'' the source said. ``It's a
system followed by most of the major studios.''
</P>
<P>
   Thom Davis, the business representative in Burbank, Calif., for
the Motion Picture Studio Grips and Crafts Service workers that
represents the riggers injured on the ``X-Files'' crew last week,
questions the policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a problem. I shouldn't ever have to talk to an employee
about having a first aid person,'' Davis said. ``It's a monetary
issue. According to these people, they don't have enough money to
set up a hot dog stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Platz-Petersen said the producers opt to do away with medics to
avoid injury reports that reflect unfavorable statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``My own personal opinion is they want to claim a safe industry,
which they're not,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them, excuse me, you're blowing up cars. What do you
mean you don't need medical care?''
</P>
<P>
   A trained medic was on scene to handle the ill-fated ``X-Files''
setup July 31, but only because the crew realized that they were
without a medic three hours earlier, Platz-Petersen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A minor incident happened three hours earlier when something
dropped on somebody's arm,'' she said. ``If they chose to not have
somebody, you probably would have had more than one death. ... They
roll the dice on people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Lampros, a medic, was praised by firefighters and workers
for saving other men on the scaffolding. Christian Silver, 35, is
the only one who remains hospitalized, in good condition, UCLA
hospital officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Though industry officials would not comment on the electrocution
because the case is under investigation, Davis, who represents the
grips, said more education is needed to prevent TV and film
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Sony Pictures Entertainment of Culver City, Calif., insists on
having a preproduction safety meeting with department heads before
any setting up for a film, said Rosanne Feild, executive director
of Sony's corporate safety and environmental affairs. And a medic
is mandatory at a film site, even during setup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always learn. ... We've chosen to follow the law,'' Feild
said.
</P>
<P>
   She said that it's this training and having medics on site that
have given Sony a favorable track record of one fatality in seven
years and about two to three injuries in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who represents the grips, said even more safety training
is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never enough. You can always do more. ... I think what
happened last Monday sort of points to that.''

<P>
   SONOMA, Calif. _ Don't be surprised if Doug Kalitta makes a
suggestion to run all the National Hot Rod Association national
events at Sears Point Raceway here.
</P>
<P>
   That was the feeling Sunday after the former USAC Silver Crown
champion defeated Larry Dixon to capture his third consecutive Top
Fuel final at the 13th annual Fram Autolite Nationals.
</P>
<P>
   Other winners were John Force in Funny Car and Kurt Johnson in
Pro Stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I guess this would be a good place to have them all,''
said Kalitta, who won a tire-smoking battle over Dixon in the final
round. ``I don't know what it is about this place. I wish we could
carry it around to all the races. We just seem to come along on a
combination that was working for us this weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   That showed early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Kalitta, who blistered the track with a stout 4.657-second pass
during qualifying Saturday, backed it up with a solid 4.661 in a
first-round victory over Craig Smith. He then followed with
back-to-back 4.70s before defeating Dixon in the final, which saw
both drivers overpower the track.
</P>
<P>
   Kalitta held a slight advantage off the starting line before
both he and Dixon smoked the tires near half-track. Kalitta
recovered first and was able to just drive past the Don Prudhomme
dragster at the finish line, finishing a mere 0.21 seconds ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the thing started losing traction, I was just hoping I
wouldn't see him,'' Kalitta said. ``About halfway, I pumped it once
and we were able to sneak by.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right there at the end, I saw him then. And my experience has
been that if you can see 'em at all, you've lost. So I was pretty
confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Force, who earned his 88th career victory and his seventh of the
season when teammate Tony Pedregon jumped the start, was just
upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me he red-lighted when I got to the other end,''
said Force, who covered the quarter-mile in a sub-par 9.055 after
smoking the tires just past 330 feet. ``Then I really went into a
coma. That's your worst nightmare in a two-car deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sponsor says, `What a great job; you won. I said, `No. Half
the career is winning, the other half is keeping people loving
you.' (The spectators) want to see a race. They paid to see a
race.''
</P>
<P>
   Which Force was unable to deliver when Pedregon rolled across
the starting line a mere 23-thousands of a second before the green
light. Still, the victory was profitable for the Bell Gardens
native. He took over first place in the point standings and moved
75 points ahead of Jerry Toliver, who failed to qualify for the
first time this season.

<P>
   Sir Alec Guinness, the elegant and versatile British actor known
to older audiences for films like ``The Bridge on the River Kwai''
and to a whole new generation for his role as Obi-Wan Kenobi in
``Star Wars,'' died late Saturday at a hospital in West Sussex,
England. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   Possessing a plain-as-porridge but chameleonlike face, Guinness
was one of those gifted actors who left audiences awed with his
seemingly effortless, perfect performances, which he carried off
with quiet subtlety and undemonstrative skill.
</P>
<P>
   Although his notable career encompassed the stage and
television, it was in motion pictures that a much wider audience
found Guinness unforgettable almost from the moment he first
appeared on screen.
</P>
<P>
   He was a most versatile performer, capable of playing a wide
range of roles, beginning in 1946, when he was Herbert Pocket in
the movie adaptation of Charles Dickens' ``Great Expectations.'' He
delighted millions with his wittily etched, tour-de-force
delineations of 10 members of an eccentric English family
(including a spinster and a character in an oil painting) in ``Kind
Hearts and Coronets'' in 1949. And he developed a cult following
for his merry antics in ``The Lavender Hill Mob'' and ``The
Captain's Paradise.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his most memorable dramatic roles was the driven
regimental colonel in postwar Scotland in ``Tunes of Glory.'' And
another military role, as the slightly mad military prig of a
colonel in ``The Bridge on the River Kwai'' in 1957, won him an
Academy Award. He was knighted in the late 1950s by Queen
Elizabeth, but still had a long career ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was often said that as a master of disguise he was
an actor with no face of his own, it was, in fact, the intelligent
use of his malleable features that served him so extraordinarily
well. In situations where lesser performers required several lines
of dialogue to accomplish an effect, Guinness used his own facial
shorthand _ the faint curling of a lip, a seemingly apologetic
furrowing of the brow, the quizzical upturn of an eyebrow, the
slight but visible widening of the eyes in disbelief, a sudden
brief smile that could radiate approval or signify chilly disdain.
Particularly in motion-picture close-up, he did not so much act as
allow his face to react to what another actor was saying.
</P>
<P>
   He was the antithesis of the personality player or star, for he
accepted small and large roles that ranged from the starkly
dramatic to the predictably melodramatic to the maniacally
whimsical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I've done has been on the spur of the moment,'' the
actor said some years ago. ``That's why my career has been so
haphazard.''
</P>
<P>
   Haphazard or not, it was a notable career, one in which Guinness
triumphed in the theater in roles as startlingly dissimilar as
Hamlet and the suave psychiatrist in T.S. Eliot's ``Cocktail
Party.'' He was the drink-sodden and doomed Welsh poet Dylan Thomas
in Sidney Michaels' biographical drama ``Dylan'' and the tragically
broken and brainwashed prelate in ``The Prisoner.''
</P>
<P>
   He also played a Japanese businessman in ``A Majority of One''
in 1962, the same year that he was seen as the Arab prince, Feisal,
in ``Lawrence of Arabia.'' He had business savvy as well _ for his
memorable role in the 1977 blockbuster ``Star Wars,'' he received a
percentage of the gross.
</P>
<P>
   Guinness was born in London on April 2, 1914.
</P>
<P>
   In his autobiography, ``Blessings in Disguise,'' published in
the United States in 1986, Guinness cleared up longtime speculation
as to whether he was an illegitimate child. He was indeed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Pembroke Lodge, a boarding school, the headmaster discouraged
the youth from student theatricals by telling him, ``You're not the
acting type,'' but later, at Roborough School in Eastbourne, he won
the role of the breathless messenger in ``Macbeth.''
</P>
<P>
   His schooling finished in 1932, he went to work as an apprentice
copywriter in a London advertising agency. ``The very first thing I
did was on impulse to phone Martita Hunt and ask her to give me
acting lessons,'' he recalled years later. ``After a few lessons
she sent me packing.'' In fact, after 12 lessons, Hunt, a renowned
actress who later played Habersham with him in ``Great
Expectations,'' told the drab and emaciated young man in 1933,
``You'll never make an actor, Mr. Guinness.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the would-be actor applied to the Fay Compton
Studio of Dramatic Art, which gave him a modest scholarship, and he
was able to study and live on a single baked-beans-on-toast meal a
day. Guinness left the Compton Studio after seven months, but not
before an annual recital at which the judges, John Gielgud among
them, awarded him a major prize. (MORE)
</P>
<P>
   In 1934, literally a starving young actor, Guinness got work in
a lurid shipboard melodrama called ``Queer Cargo,'' in which he
played three small roles. Then Gielgud gave him his first big
break, casting him as Osric and the Third Player in the Gielgud
production of ``Hamlet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My theater tide began to come in because of Sir John's
generosity, for from that point on I was never truly out of a job
unless I wanted it that way,'' Guinness recalled in 1982. He was
from the start a sort of critics' darling _ one called his Osric in
``Hamlet'' an ``admirable popinjay,'' and later his Sir Andrew
Aguecheek in ``Twelfth Night'' was pronounced ``a collector's
item.''
</P>
<P>
   Before enlisting in the Royal Navy in 1941, the actor had
learned many lessons well, having played 34 parts in 23 plays by
Shakespeare, Pinero, Chekhov, Shaw and Sheridan. ``It was
obvious,'' Tyrone Guthrie said about that period, ``that he was
going to be tremendously talented. It was not so obvious that he
was going to be so popular.''
</P>
<P>
   On being mustered out, he resumed his writing and stage career
in the role of Mitya in his own version of Dostoyevski's ``Brothers
Karamazov,'' an artistic success that failed at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   His other stage appearances in the postwar period included roles
in Sartre's ``Vicious Circle,'' the Dauphin in Shaw's ``Saint
Joan'' and the title role in Shakespeare's ``Richard II.'' Of the
last, the critic for The Sunday Express of London wrote: ``Mr.
Guinness is slight, with an interesting angular face and a clear,
flexible voice. He has dignity, but no majesty; he has range and
control, but no surprises. He is intensely good without being great
_ yet. His future may bring that.'' In 1946, the director David
Lean cast him as Pocket in the now-classic film version of ``Great
Expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1947 Lean allowed him to play an extremely wicked Fagin in a
controversial version of ``Oliver Twist,'' whose release in the
United States was held up for more than two years because of
pressure brought by groups that considered the Guinness
characterization anti-Semitic. The U.S. version was also censored,
but among moviegoers worldwide, Guinness had clinched his claim to
fame.
</P>
<P>
   A choice comedy role came in 1953 in ``The Captain's Paradise,''
when he played a Mediterranean ferryboat skipper who commutes
between wives as well as ports. Along came ``The Ladykillers'' in
1955, closely followed by his first Hollywood film, a glossily cold
remake of Molnar's ``The Swan'' in which he starred with Grace
Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   In his greatest film triumph, ``The Bridge on the River Kwai,''
Guinness was called upon to be ``both admirable and tiresome,'' he
said, as the fascinatingly paradoxical Colonel Nicholson, a British
officer interned in a hellish Japanese prisoner-of-war camp in
Burma. He made Nicholson at times infuriating, at times pitiable, a
man whose strict adherence to an old-fashioned code of military
ethics was both his scourge and his moral salvation.
</P>
<P>
   As Gulley Jimson in ``The Horse's Mouth,'' he was an unkempt old
rogue of a painter who was so obsessed by his art that he had no
regard for the feelings or needs of anyone who dared impinge on his
creativity. Guinness received an Academy Award nomination, not for
his acting, which was splendid, but for the screenplay he wrote
from the novel by Joyce Cary.
</P>
<P>
   Other film roles included ``The Comedians,'' ``The Quiller
Memorandum,'' ``A Christmas Carol'' and Franco Zeffirelli's
``Brother Sun, Sister Moon,'' none of which reversed the descending
trend of the actor's film fortunes in the early 1970s. In 1976,
however, he easily stole all his scenes in Neil Simon's ``Murder by
Death,'' a mystery spoof in which he played a blind butler Although
films occupied most of his time, Guinness did not entirely desert
the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1977, came the first installment of George Lucas's
legendary space sagas. ``I might never have been heard of again if
it hadn't been for `Star Wars','' Guiness once said. Yet he also
said that he didn't care for the ``Star Wars'' frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Among Guinness' later films were ``A Passage to India'' (1984)
and ``Little Dorrit'' (1987). He also wrote another book late in
life, ``My Name Escapes Me: The Diary of a Retiring Actor'' (1997).
</P>
<P>
   His greatest success on Broadway came in 1964, when Peter
Glenville prodded him into taking the tricky and difficult title
role in ``Dylan,'' an anecdotal drama dealing with the
self-destructive poet Dylan Thomas' last liquor-sodden months.
Guinness was the antithesis in character of the Welsh poet, but he
gave a performance so heartwrenchingly sad that he won almost every
available acting prize that season. The critic Walter Kerr termed
the performance ``mesmerizing,'' adding, ``There is a still center
in the actor, a coal in the ashes that defies us to will our eyes
away.'' (Years later, commenting on a trifling play superbly acted
by Guinness in London, Kerr, not content with the title Queen
Elizabeth II had conferred on the actor, dubbed him ``St. Alec.'')
</P>
<P>
   Guinness' appearances on television were rare but memorable. His
most notable achievement was the character of George Smiley, the
retired British intelligence officer he created in two multipart
series seen in Britain and the United States in the early 1980s _
``Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy'' and ``Smiley's People,'' written
by John le Carre. His understated characterization of the aging,
spiritually burnt-out and forlorn former spy underscored his
reputation as ``an actor who makes you forget that he is acting.''
</P>
<P>
   Guinness, who had been almost bald since his late 20s, was often
described as ``dignified'' and ``shy'' and ``quiet, unassuming.''
He lived modestly in an unpretentious house in Hampshire, in the
south of England, with his wife, Merula Salaman, a former actress.
They were married in 1938 when both were appearing as animals in
John Gielgud's production of ``Noah.'' They had a son, Matthew.

PEREZ IS FINE IN RELIEF STINT

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ So, like, this Carlos Perez guy, how can the Los
Angeles Dodgers keep him out of the rotation? Perez, who must have
thought ``soft-throwing'' had become his new first name, had been
so unproductive (4-6, 5.67 ERA) that he lost his starting spot in
the rotation last week to 30-year-old rookie Matt Herges.
</P>
<P>
   But in his first appearance out of the bullpen since being
bumped out of the rotation, Perez was _ dare it be said? _
masterful on Sunday against the Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   Perez threw 5 scoreless innings, holding Milwaukee to three
hits, with a walk and three strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   __ Sheffield out: Gary Sheffield was held out of the game with a
swollen right thumb, jammmed in the ninth inning Saturday
attempting to steal.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said Sheffield might be out three
days or more, but after being examined by team doctors later, the
outfielder said he could be back as soon as tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be no problem,'' Sheffield said. ``It's just sore
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield said at first he was too concerned with the umpire's
call on his steal attempt to realize what had happened to his
thumb.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was too busy arguing against the call,'' he said. ``But I
knew when the adrenaline wore off, it was going to be sore.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield had missed only two previous games this season, with a
sprained ankle. He said one of his goals is to play a complete
162-game season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came close in 1996, but they (Marlins manager John Boles)
benched me for being late,'' he said. ``And I wasn't even late.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Meet Bruce Aven, almost: Trying to build needed outfield
depth, the Dodgers picked up Bruce Aven from the Pirates and
assigned him to Triple-A Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   With Sheffield out and F.P. Santangelo serving the fourth day of
his five-game suspension, the Dodgers played Sunday without a
backup outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   Aven, 28, was batting .250 with five home runs in 72 games for
the Pirates. His fifth home run came on Tuesday against the Dodgers
in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for Aven, the Pirates will get either a player to be
named or cash by Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're short outfielders that are ready to play at this
level,'' Johnson said. ``We've gone most of the way with three or
four.''
</P>
<P>
   Aven came to the Pirates in the offseason from Florida in
exchange for outfielder Brant Brown after hitting .289 with 12 home
runs and 70 RBI with the Marlins in 1999, his first full season in
the majors.
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: RHP Kevin Brown, who left Friday's game in the
eighth inning after feeling a ``tweak'' in his right side, has
reported no additional pain and will take his next regular turn
Wednesday against the Cubs. . . . The Dodgers might have caught a
break. With the Cubs placing right-hander Kerry Wood on the
disabled list Sunday, left-hander Phil Norton (0-0, 5.40 ERA) will
take his turn Tuesday against Darren Dreifort (8-7,4.61). . . . It
was a bad day for the Dodgers to have a starting pitcher get
shelled early. Right-hander Antonio Osuna was unavailable with
flu-like symptoms. . . . When right-handed reliever Mike Fetters
took the loss Saturday, it was the first for the bullpen since July
2 at San Francisco, snapping a winning streak at eight games. . . .
Former Saugus High School standout Nate Wright signed as a free
agent with the Dodgers' short-season Single-A Yakima club. In his
first two games through Saturday, Wright was 1 for 2 with an RBI
and a walk.

REVOLUTION MIDFIELD MAY NEED REVAMPING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The evolution of the Revolution midfield
provides an indication of the team's future.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1-1 tie against the Columbus Crew Saturday night, John
Harkes was flanked by two energetic young markers _ Joe Franchino
and Carlos Parra. The combination was effective in discouraging the
Crew midfield. Roles were clearly defined. Harkes was the point of
reference, but he also contributed defensively.
</P>
<P>
   But this was not what coach Fernando Clavijo envisioned when he
was hired in December. Nor did it produce offensive inspiration or
spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   Clavijo and director of soccer Sunil Gulati conceived the
Revolution as a Latin-flavored team, with Bolivian Mauricio Ramos
choreographing the midfield.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos, though, has been relegated to the bench. Leonel Alvarez
will return from suspension for the Revolution's visit to the
MetroStars Saturday. But Alvarez's availability again raises the
question of redundancy in the supporting midfield positions.
</P>
<P>
   The flaws in the Revolution's 3-5-2 design are becoming more
apparent as they fight for a playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   The team is experienced up the middle, with goalkeeper Juergen
Sommer, libero Mauricio Wright, either Alvarez or Harkes in
midfield, and Wolde Harris-Jose Luis Morales as the strike
combination.
</P>
<P>
   But for the team to progress, the midfield should be guided by
either Alvarez or Harkes, not both. Ramos should be the creative
midfielder, flanked by a younger player, either Parra or someone
like Paulo Dos Santos, who was cut in the preseason and is now
playing for Aalesund in Norway.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos has not played a full game since the Revolution's 4-1 loss
at Columbus July 12. In that game, New England's weaknesses were
exploited by a more dynamic and versatile Crew attack. Clavijo has
since attempted to adjust, and the Revolution lineup, which
outplayed Columbus for most of the second half Saturday, included
seven players 24 or younger.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution lineup includes more speed and variety than a
year ago. Clavijo has been resourceful in utilizing those qualities
_ substitutes William Sunsing and Johnny Torres nearly salvaged a
victory against the Crew. But the concept of a cohesive, flowing
attack has been sacrificed. The Revolution have a 9-10-6 record and
are in playoff contention, but they have seldom made the game seem
easy.
</P>
<P>
   And as teams compete in the stretch run, matches will be tinged
with more desperation. As in previous Revolution seasons, players
who give the appearance of working hard will be favored. There will
be more fight than flair. And, whether the Revolution qualify for
the playoffs or not, the team's makeup will have to be reevaluated,
starting with the midfield.

NORDICAN INCH WINS SPICY LIVING 
</HEADLINE>
 LIVING SWEEPS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALEM, N.H. _ With Saratoga in full swing, it is difficult for
Rockingham to attract an outstanding field, even for the $100,000
purse offered in Sunday's Spicy Living Sweepstakes. However,
although only five horses contested the 1 1/8-mile turf event, it
turned into a memorable battle between two fillies with a future,
as Nordican Inch nipped Always Sure by a nose.
</P>
<P>
   From the powerful New York stable of Christophe Clement,
Nordican Inch, who began her career in France and races for Edouard
de Rothschild of the famous banking and wine making family, is the
real deal. She never has been out of the money (13-4-6-3), and she
justified her favorite's odds of 11-10 ($4.20 to win) by escaping a
trap in the upper stretch under Joe Hampshire and staging a
rippling run to the wire in 1:49 3/5.
</P>
<P>
   Always Sure, from the the up-and-coming barn of Tom Amoss, who
is a force in the Midwest and is currently stabled at The Spa, is
also a horse to watch. She ran a strong race with Eddie Martin Jr.
aboard, losing in the final jump as the 8-5 second choice. Final
Tango, the least accomplished of the three New York invaders,
finished third, a length and three-quarters behind with Filiberto
Leon, after leading turning for home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nordican Inch is a pretty difficult filly to ride,'' said
Nicholas Balachard, assistant trainer for Clement. ``She gets very
rank. We told Joe to just take her back and follow Amoss's filly,
and that's what he did. Joe came up the rail. Sometimes a hole
opens and sometimes it doesn't. This time, it didn't. But Joe got
out, and she came running. She was very game. This was a very good
race; it was a thrilling finish.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampshire, who rode four winners on the day and is the leading
rider at the meet with 53 victories, was momentarily blocked when
Always Sure swept past Final Tango at the top of the lane, and both
horses dropped over in front of Nordican Inch.
</P>
<P>
   ``She settled pretty well, and I wasn't worried,'' said
Hampshire. ``I had a lot of horse, and I was sitting, sitting,
sitting. I let her run to try to get through, but we got in a
traffic jam. Martin did a great job. He came around, and tried to
box me in, then he drew off. I got Nordican Inch out, hit her
righthanded, and she just exploded. I must admit it probably wasn't
the smoothest trip I ever had, but we wound up in good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Amoss, who has won six training titles at Fair Grounds and is
currently conditioning Heritage Of Gold, the top handicap mare in
the country, at Saratoga, felt his filly was compromised when she
got a bit nervous.
</P>

   DEATHROW-RETARDED (Livingston, Texas) _ Oliver Cruz, who was
convicted for capital murder, has spent 11 years on death row here,
and the state of Texas has set his execution for Wednesday, Aug. 9,
at 6 p.m. His execution is scheduled at a time when there is
growing opposition across the country to executing the mentally

it could be as high as 10 percent. By Raymond Bonner and Sara

   NEW-PLANETS (Undated) _ Where there is one planet around a star,
there are likely to be more. At least, that is the view of
astronomers at the University of California at Berkeley. The reason
astronomers have not sighted more multiple-planet systems, they
say, is simply that they have not looked long enough. Dr. Debra A.
Fischer, a postdoctoral fellow at Berkeley, re-examined data from
12 stars known to have one planet to see if they contained
unnoticed evidence of other planets. ``Five of them showed extra
wobbles,'' Fischer said. ``That indicates the presence of some
other thing there.'' The findings were presented Sunday at the

for new car models and clothes as well as promotions pegged to the

CRUCIAL ISSUES REMAIN FOR OZ DEVELOPMENT 
</HEADLINE>
 DEVELOPMENT-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GRACE HOBSON  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the Johnson County, Kan., Commission prepares to vote on the
Oz Entertainment Co.'s plan to develop the Sunflower Army
Ammunition Plant site, significant questions remain and key
agreements have not been reached.
</P>
<P>
   The commission will begin its public review Wednesday with a 7
p.m. work session at which Oz officials will detail the complex
transaction. Three public comment meetings will follow this month.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings come almost two months after Oz and federal
officials announced they had ``substantially completed'' the deal _
and after federal officials pushed the county to start the approval
process.
</P>
<P>
   The County Commission must give its approval before the plan to
transfer Sunflower to Oz for development of an $861 million theme
park and resort can go forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're finally starting,'' said Blaine Hastings, the federal
official overseeing the transfer. ``The longer (Sunflower) sits
there, the more it costs the taxpayers'' as the government
maintains the land and does some cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   But several issues have not been resolved, according to
interviews and county documents:
</P>
<P>
   Oz must rework an agreement that spells out the deal between Oz
and the state to transfer the land and possibly issue bonds. An Oz
attorney called the agreement the ``key document'' yet to be
completed.
</P>
<P>
   Oz has not announced a developer for a hotel and
entertainment//retail complex. Those developments would provide the
revenue to pay back some of the bonds Oz wants the Kansas
Development Finance Authority to issue.
</P>
<P>
   .MDNM/ Questions remain about how realistic the Oz company's
feasibility studies are. An Oz opponent with expertise in
government finance calls the company's attendance projections
faulty.
</P>
<P>
   The county has questions about the company's finance plan and
its request for public improvements to the site.
</P>
<P>
   In a memo to county commissioners, county Chief Counsel Don
Jarrett listed 24 questions and issues that were not resolved in
the Oz company's redevelopment plan released in June.
</P>
<P>
   Oz officials say they will answer the questions during the work
session Wednesday and in subsequent discussions with the county and
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Mr. Jarrett's document addresses the right issues. We
respect those right issues, and we look forward to addressing
them,'' Oz spokesman David Westbrook said.
</P>
<P>
   The project is complex: The federal government agrees to
transfer the land in phases to the state through the finance
authority. The state would immediately transfer the land to Oz. The
company will agree to take all 9,065 acres of Sunflower and clean
the land of contamination caused by years of propellant
manufacture.
</P>
<P>
   A redevelopment agreement spells out the authority's involvement
in the land transfer and its ability to issue bonds for the
project. Oz plans to finance almost a third of the project with
those bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Oz submitted its redevelopment agreement to the authority in
June. The authority, however, found it unacceptable and asked the
company to revise it, said Rebecca Floyd, the authority's executive
vice president and general counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognized there was no point in spending anyone's time or
resources, knowing that this document contained issues significant
enough to cause significant problems for the transaction as a
whole,'' Floyd said. ``We did want to give them an opportunity to
rectify those issues.''
</P>
<P>
   One important issue is whether the agreement commits the
authority to issuing the bonds, said Oz attorney Larry Winn.
</P>
<P>
   He said the authority wants to ``maintain their absolute
discretion'' in deciding to issue bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as we approach our investors and investment bankers, they
need assurance that under certain circumstances there would be no
reason (the finance authority) would not issue the bonds,'' Winn
said. ``It's two sides of one coin.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is important because the finance authority may
proceed with the land transaction before the financing structure _
including the bonds _ is in place.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd said Oz and the finance authority had planned to close on
the land and soon after complete the financing deal. But it appears
now that Oz may complete the financing at a later date, possibly a
few months after the closing, Floyd and Winn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a business issue and decision for them,'' Floyd said.
``If they're comfortable closing on the land without the financing
structure in place, that's certainly their decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Oz opponents worry that the company wants the land without
having to build the theme park. Although the opponents don't want a
theme park there, they are concerned that Oz is more interested in
getting cheap land than in its proposed development.
</P>
<P>
   But Floyd said the land would have to be used according to the
plan in the redevelopment agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Oz could sell the land, but any buyer who wanted to tap the
authority's ability to issue bonds for the site would have to go
through the process outlined in state law. Even if the buyer did
not want bonds, the land would be protected by deed restrictions
requiring that the land be cleaned up _ paid for by Oz and its
insurance _ before it is developed.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd said ``myriad contractual considerations'' would prevent a
land grab.
</P>
<P>
   Winn said Oz has no interest in the land without a theme park.
The land would not be ready for development for decades without the
Oz project, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The land and the project are inseparable,'' Winn said. ``We
don't want the land without a high possibility of a project to go
on the land.''
</P>
<P>
   Another obstacle to completing the deal is a lawsuit brought by
Taxpayers Opposed to Oz against the federal government. The
authority won't close on the land until the lawsuit is resolved,
Floyd said.
</P>
<P>
   The taxpayers group, known as TOTO, wants a federal judge to
stop the transfer until the government conducts more studies of the
land deal's impact.
</P>
<P>
   Oz opponents also continue to question the feasibility of the Oz
plan.
</P>
<P>
   TOTO will present an analysis of the company's feasibility study
at a public comment meeting this month.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Wilson, a certified public accountant who consults with
city governments on utility issues, concluded in his analysis that
the Oz study is faulty. Wilson owns 80 acres of land near
Sunflower.
</P>
<P>
   To project revenues, Oz estimates that 2.8 million to 3.2
million people will visit the theme park each year.
</P>
<P>
   But Wilson said those figures are high. If 2.8 million people
visit, the theme park would capture 22 percent of Kansas City's
tourist market. Of 19 theme parks listed in the Oz study, only two
capture that much of their markets.
</P>
<P>
   Given that, Wilson said he doesn't think the attendance figure
is reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't get past that, the rest of the numbers fall
apart,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Oz officials have said the project will generate the necessary
attendance and revenue because it will be a ``destination'' resort
that will expand Kansas City's tourism market.
</P>
<P>
   To be a ``destination complex,'' the Oz studies state, the
project must include an entertainment//retail village and a resort
with a 350-room hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The studies assume that the entertainment//retail village would
generate $132 million a year and that the resort would generate $33
million a year in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   But Oz has not announced that it has a developer for those
projects, which concerns Jarrett at the county. Without the
developments, Oz could not repay the sales tax bonds it wants the
finance authority to issue, Jarrett said. Sales tax generated at
the theme park and resort would be used to pay off those bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also does not say what would happen to property taxes
that the hotel and retail village would owe, Jarrett said. The plan
does not say those taxes would be used to pay off tax-increment
financing bonds that Oz wants, but it also doesn't say the tax
amount would go to the county, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's not needed (for bonds) but it's not going to us, I
think that's a big issue,'' Jarrett said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the county needs more information on a road and dam
Oz wants it to build for the project. The company's financial plan
shows the road costing $6 million, but Jarrett noted that elsewhere
in the report the figure is listed at $6 million to $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   Oz wants the state to build a $29 million interchange off Kansas
10, but the state did not include it among the $1 billion in
projects announced Friday. That leads to questions about the
company's contingency plan, Jarrett said.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of the interchange to handle Oz's visitors ``will
create some questions in the approval'' process, Jarrett said. The
commission could approve the redevelopment agreement without the
interchange. But it would not grant the company a conditional-use
permit, allowing it to start building the project, without a
commitment on the interchange, Jarrett said.
</P>
<P>
   Also of concern to Jarrett: Oz says a private company would
provide sewers to the area but hasn't said which company; Oz says
its plan depends on $20 million in economic development grants, but
it is unclear whether the company will be able to get those grants;
and the county needs more information on how Oz would use
authority-issued bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Oz knew there would be more questions, and the company will
address them, Winn said.
</P>
<P>
   The company is looking forward to showing the commission and the
public the entire Oz project, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Winn noted that he recently saw the project referred to as a
``carnival.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone needs to get higher on the learning curve so
we can dispose of the stereotypical statements and focus on the
project itself,'' Winn said.

Hampton open to return to Astros
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JOSEPH DUARTE
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Mike Hampton, just months away from becoming one of
the most sought-after pitchers on the free-agent market, isn't
ruling out the possibility of re-signing with the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they make some moves to get better, of course,'' Hampton
told reporters this weekend in Phoenix, where the New York Mets
played the Arizona Diamondbacks. ``If they make a legitimate shot,
I'll consider it _ like any team.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton, 27, will return to Houston, where he played for six
seasons, and get his first glimpse of Enron Field when he starts
tonight's series opener against the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton, who set an Astros record with 22 victories last season,
was traded to the Mets last December for righthander Octavio Dotel,
outfielder Roger Cedeno and a minor-league pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton said he expects an emotional homecoming when he starts
against his former teammates. The lefthander has kept in close
contact with several Astros, including Jeff Bagwell and Craig
Biggio.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be one of those things where I'll have to hold myself
back,'' he said. ``I'll just try to relax and not be too pumped
up.''
</P>
<P>
   After being part of three NL Central winners, Hampton is
surprised the Astros own the worst record in baseball (42-69).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to think that if I had stayed there we'd be in first
place right now,'' he said. ``I'm happy to be on this team,
especially with the way things have gone (in Houston). I guess
timing was on my side.''

Hampton won't be swayed back easily
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JOHN P. LOPEZ
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ If he could have pitched every other day as well as
played a little shortstop, second base and third base and served as
staff closer on his days off, then maybe Mike Hampton could have
made a difference.
</P>
<P>
   If he could have driven in 120 runs and stolen 70 bases, then
maybe the Astros truly would have been able to say ``what if''
today when the former staff ace takes the mound at Enron Field for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hampy's great, but Cy Young couldn't have turned it around for
us this year,'' incumbent Astros ace Scott Elarton said. ``It's
just been one of those years.''
</P>
<P>
   Not by any stretch is Hampton's absence the only reason the
Astros fell apart in 2000. His departure to the Mets was only the
start of the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Neither was Hampton some kind of Superman, although he figures
to be paid like one when free-agent offers come falling into his
lap like mountains of gold this offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Which leads to the intrigue and irony of Hampton's returning to
Houston today, as so many imaginations dance to the tune of somehow
luring him back.
</P>
<P>
   He won't come until things change. And maybe things won't really
look like they're changing until he comes back.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton returns today leading the kind of team that could win it
all if things fall right. After a sluggish start to the 2000
season, he is, at 11-7, showing the kind of stuff that could lead
to maybe $14 million a year from the Mets, Braves, Cardinals, Red
Sox or Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Astros' chances, you want to say Enron is the place
and Houston the city that Hampton should crave, and surely he
should have reasons to want to make a triumphant return.
</P>
<P>
   With his good looks and good stuff, his leadership, youth and
grit, you want to say Hampton is all the Astros need to get back to
winning titles instead of spiraling downward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things happen when you have a pitcher that you know will win
every time out,'' Astros slugger Jeff Bagwell said. ``A great
pitcher can help everyone and mess up the hitters on the other team
for the whole series.
</P>
<P>
   Look what Kevin Brown did to us in (the '98 Division Series).
You just never know.''
</P>
<P>
   For sure, the Astros would have become a better team had Hampton
been on the hill for opening night in April. And feel free to side
with whomever you want on the failed Hampton negotiations of last
winter that led to the Mets trade _ ownership, which said Hampton
never seriously considered staying, or Hampton's representatives,
who said the Astros never talked serious dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But even with Hampton, the Astros would not have been a
championship team. And they wouldn't have for the same reason
Hampton left and probably won't come back. It takes more than just
one man, even when that man is a ground-ball ace lefty who's
capable of 20-plus wins in any given year.
</P>
<P>
   No one realizes this more than Hampton. He all but wrote his own
trade papers last offseason, because when looking around the
organization, he saw hints of what was to come: A tightening
budget, an iffy relief staff, a manager in whom he had lost
confidence, and a commitment to winning that was dwindling as cash
cow Enron Field was going up.
</P>
<P>
   As much as the Astros consider themselves legitimate contenders
to bring back the much-adored Hampton to his Houston fans, they
won't be until all those things that sent him away in the first
place begin to turn around.
</P>
<P>
   ``He enjoyed playing here,'' said Bagwell, who has kept in
contact with Hampton all year. ``But there's no way we can sign him
right now the way things are. It's not exactly the best atmosphere
in the world compared to other places, and he's the premier pitcher
on the free-agent market. But if things change, who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   So take a long, hard look at Hampton working his sinking stuff
at Enron tonight. Sure, it's easy to imagine how significant it
would be for the club to get Hampton back, particularly because his
pitching style fits the stadium better than that of most any other
pitcher in the league.
</P>
<P>
   But just as it was last offseason, getting Hampton is not only
about Hampton. Before anyone in management thinks seriously about
making a run at their former ace, they have to make a run at a
shortstop, a third baseman and serious relief help.
</P>
<P>
   Before Hampton casts anything more than courtesy glances back at
Houston, Bagwell must sign an extension, and decisions will need to
be made regarding the futures here of Ken Caminiti, Moises Alou and
manager Larry Dierker.
</P>
<P>
   For six seasons, Hampton was known as ``the Bulldog'' in
Houston. He didn't earn the nickname chasing only dollars, although
he is a rare breed.
</P>
<P>
   He cares about winning. And if the Astros want him back, they're
going to have to show how much they care, too.
</P>

VALDES BATTERED IN L.A. RETURN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On the darker side of the pitching ledger, there
is bad, really bad _ and Ismael Valdes Sunday against the Milwaukee
Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes was so remarkably bad, he managed what no one in the Los
Angeles Dodgers organization has been able to pull off all season _
earn cheers for Carlos Perez.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, those came as Perez replaced Valdes, who left having
allowed seven runs on eight hits _ all currently being tracked by
NASA _ in 1 innings of what could loosely be described as work.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers never could fully recover, ultimately losing 9-6,
falling to 3 games back of the Giants and being left to plead that
this was some kind of otherworldly one-game aberration for Valdes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was as hard as I've ever seen him hit,'' said Dodgers
manager Davey Johnson, who wasn't alone. ``I really don't know what
the problem was.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdes was making his first start at Dodger Stadium since being
reacquired by the Dodgers last week in that unexpected trade with
the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Of the eight hits he allowed in his brief stint, four were
doubles and one a home run.
</P>
<P>
   On the bright side, no Dodgers fielders were killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what happened,'' Valdes said. ``Everything was
right. I just got my (butt) kicked.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, everything was right except for !ital!that.
</P>
<P>
   Completing the strange night was the relief work of Perez, who
took over in the second and proceeded to pitch 5 innings of shutout
ball. The struggling Perez was removed from the rotation last week
in favor of 30-year-old rookie Matt Herges, who is making his first
start tonight against the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carlos did a good job, we just didn't have enough to get
back,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes had been a disappointment with the Cubs this season (2-4,
5.32 ERA) and had been so-so in his one previous start for the
Dodgers in Pittsburgh (two earned runs, four hits in four innings).
But nothing that would have hinted at Sunday. Valdes got the first
two outs to open the game but then gave up consecutive singles
before a two-run Jeromy Burnitz double.
</P>
<P>
   He started the second with a walk to Jose Hernandez and then
gave up a double to that new Dodger killer, Henry Blanco.
Right-hander pitcher Jimmy Haynes, who had one RBI in his previous
42 at-bats, then doubled in two. And on it went. Ron Belliard
singled in Haynes.
</P>
<P>
   Marquis Grissom popped up for Valdes' only out of the inning,
but then former USC Trojan Geoff Jenkins _ who had homered twice on
Saturday _ homered again, and it was 7-zip.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt like it was just a line drive that kept going,''
Jenkins said.
</P>
<P>
   When Richie Sexson then doubled, Johnson got merciful and
removed Valdes. He left to a chorus of boos.
</P>
<P>
   And welcome home.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the end of the world,'' Valdes said. ``We have to
continue working, concentrate and do more the next start.''
</P>
<P>
   He did leave himself room for improvement. To his credit,
though, Valdes waited for over two hours after his exit to face the
media.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's loss completed a disappointing weekend series against
the underwhelming Brewers (47-64), who took two of three games
after the Dodgers had won the series opener on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers couldn't do much with Haynes (10-10), who had not
won since July 7 and had a 7.40 ERA over his last four starts.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers finally scored two in the fifth on a Perez groundout
and Tom Goodwin single, then two more in the seventh on RBI singles
by Alex Cora and Mark Grudzielanek, who also singled in a pair in
the ninth. But there would be no coming back from that 7-0 hole
Valdes had left them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before when we faced him, he was hitting his spots,''
Hernandez said. ``Tonight he was leaving it out over the plate.''

   The peak months of the hurricane season begin with August, and
though we're more concerned here with blowing dust and palm fronds
than storms of mass destruction, the National Hurricane Center's
official site offers armchair meteorologists as much data as they
can handle. No, more. In addition to up-to-the-minute satellite
images, landlocked storm buffs will find tracking charts and
detailed accounts of aircraft reconnaissance missions as well as
long-term forecasts. (According to the center, conditions have
aligned to make this season a busy one, at least in the Atlantic.)

<P>
   ``PURPLE CANE ROAD''
</P>
<P>
   by James Lee Burke
</P>
<P>
   (Doubleday, $24.95)
</P>
<P>
   Burke has been called the Faulkner of crime fiction, and while
we might quibble with the particulars, there's no denying that he's
very, very good. His characters inhabit his setting - the darker
corners of Louisiana - with consummate ease, and he makes few of
the missteps common to other writers, mistakes that disrupt a
reader's easy way through a violent and sometimes tawdry story. In
Burke's new novel, detective Dave Robicheaux learns from a New
Orleans pimp some sketchy details about the death of Robicheaux's
mother, an alleged prostitute whom he has not seen since he was in
high school. Robicheaux's obsessive search for more information
takes him through a maze of colorful characters, any one of whom
could carry a novel alone. The book's only flaw is its ending,
which has so many twists that it seems calculated. Otherwise,
there's no beating the rich, sweaty atmosphere of the bayou country
Burke portrays so well.

   ``THE WEALTH OF CHOICES''
</P>
<P>
   by Alan Murray
</P>
<P>
   (Crown, $24.95)
</P>
<P>
   Murray, Washington Bureau chief for the(beginitalic) Wall Street
Journal(enditalic) and columnist at
(beginitalic)SmartMoney(enditalic) magazine, starts his book with a
quiz that's supposed to tell if you are prepared to succeed in the
New Economy. New &AMP; Notable took this quiz, and we are dazed to
report that we scored very high - a fact that probably says more
about Murray's questions than our financial savvy. Indeed, much of
his book is just a compendium of common sense, filtered through the
sensibilities of the Internet age. His advice: Use your computer to
get information on car prices, airfares, stocks, insurance rates,
long-distance phone service. Dicker over everything you buy -
sellers often lower their prices. And don't buy the fancy model
when the standard model will do. There's not a whole lot of new
information here, but it's an effective, entry-level pep talk for
people who are intimidated by money and by the decisions that will
determine their financial futures.

<P>
   ``WRITING ON DRUGS''
</P>
<P>
   by Sadie Plant
</P>
<P>
   (FSG, $24)
</P>
<P>
   Robert Louis Stevenson wrote (beginitalic)The Strange Case of
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (enditalic)during six days and nights of a
cocaine high. Wilkie Collins dictated the last part of
(beginitalic)The Moonstone (enditalic)under the effects of opium.
``When it was finished,'' he said, ``I was not only pleased and
astonished at the finale but did not recognize it as my own.''
Anais Nin's diaries contain florid accounts of her LSD dreams, and
speed gave Philip K. Dick (beginitalic)Do Androids Dream of
(enditalic)(beginitalic)Electric Sleep(enditalic)?, the book that
became (beginitalic)Blade Runner(enditalic). Plant explores the
history of drugs and their use by writers of the last two
centuries. Her book is thought-provoking and packed with
information we're not sure we wanted to know. We learned, for
instance, that Frederic-Auguste Bartholdi, the architect of the
Statue of Liberty, was a coke enthusiast. ``It is very probable
that had I taken it 20 years ago,'' he said, ``the Statue of
Liberty would have attained the height of several hundred meters.''

<P>
   ``THE RICH AND HOW THEY GOT THAT WAY''
</P>
<P>
   by Cynthia Crossen
</P>
<P>
   (Crown, $25.95)
</P>
<P>
   ``When I fight,'' Hetty Green once said, ``there is usually a
funeral, and it isn't mine.'' She was a driven, demented, stingy
and unpleasant woman at a time when Victorian ladies were expected
to be gracious and demure. But when she died in 1916, she was worth
$100 million - more than $1 billion in today's dollars. Crossen
profiles some of the wealthiest people of all time, from
11th-century plunderer Machmud of Ghazni (who accumulated wealth by
saying ``That's mine,'' and killing anyone who disagreed) to the
sleazy and corrupt Pope Alexander VI, who made his fortune during
the 15th century through shameless use of divine imperative, and to
Bill Gates, whose monopolistic methods look like church work by
comparison. Sadly, of the 10 people here, only one is a woman, but
we like Hetty best. ``I go my own way, take no partners, risk no
one else's fortune,'' she once said, ``therefore I am Madame
Ishmael, set against every man.''

 &HT;    BIL KEANE'S `FAMILY CIRCUS' INCITES SATIRE(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a)

<TEXT>
<P>
   The recent flap over (beginitalic)Family Circus(enditalic) and
pool safety serves as a reminder that Bil Keane's seemingly gentle
comic strip long has been a hotbed of controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The strip in question - depicting the strip's daddy, Bill,
paying scant attention to his pool-paddling brood - caused a
firestorm of protest from local firefighters, and Keane quickly
altered the strip for poster reprint by adding a cautionary
caption.
</P>
<P>
   But the scuttlebutt echoed strongly the impassioned reaction to
the (beginitalic)Family Circus (enditalic)compilation
(beginitalic)What Does This Say?
</P>
<P>
   (enditalic)Reader emotion flowed onto the reader-input screens
of Amazon.com and was so memorable that the online retailer
included the typed tussle in recent anniversary celebration of
wacky reader exchanges. The collective manifesto - which admittedly
may be tongue in cheek - is still archived in full on the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keane is a genius,'' writes one correspondent.
``(beginitalic)Family Circus (enditalic)is a deconstruction of
modern suburban emasculation - sort of like the movie
(beginitalic)American Beauty(enditalic) but far more clever. I
offer my apologies to Mr. Keane. I am simply not good enough to be
in the presence of his work. I will now poke out my eyes with my
mother's brooches, such is the shame I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Another correspondent calls the strip ``the cartoon equivalent
of the faceless black monolith in the first segment of
(beginitalic)2001: A Space Odyssey (enditalic)that begets
technology and civilization among a race of ape-men. {ellipsis}
These original masterpieces have lost none of their stark,
visionary power.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet another digs for the political subtext ruling the world of
Billy, Dolly, Jeffy, et al.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nihilists and existentialists, look out!'' the writer writes.
``The profound truths conveyed through the heartwarming, hilarious
predicaments of four whimsical moppets and their parents will rock
your world view! Secular humanists, manicurists, clergy and lawyers
alike will (laugh) out loud or --at least chuckle in
self-realization at the sheer depth of humanity presented in Bil
Keane's tours de force. Belongs on the shelf with Kant, the Bible,
Nietzsche, Jung {ellipsis} to delve into again and again. Sure to
age gracefully and not to be missed.''

   One critic writes that though (beginitalic)Family Circus
(enditalic)''was once viewed as a lighthearted romp through
middle-class society. Deeper study might reveal the Marxist
overtones of the comic. This is exactly the kind of message that we
want the youth of America to absorb. We want young girls to realize
that even after many years it's never too late for a new hairstyle.
Change and revolution is coming, and Bil Keane is leading the
way.''

<P>
   Keane, reached at his Paradise Valley home, said he seldom
objects to (beginitalic)Family Circus (enditalic)satire.
</P>
<P>
   ``They select the (beginitalic)Family Circus (enditalic)because
of its innocence and its (depiction of ) American family life and
apple pie and motherhood,'' he said. ``It's the perfect target.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that 188 million people read it daily gives it an
armor that they hardly can pierce, and to me it's always flattering
they feel that the feature is known enough for them to take
potshots.''

   (UNDATED) _ How different last week was from the last occasion
when a Bush accepted the presidential nomination of the Republican
Party.
</P>
<P>
   True, back in Houston 1992, they stuck up a bronze statue of the
president outside the Astrodome, and almost managed to kid
themselves they could win in November.
</P>
<P>
   But whereas George W. Bush took a double digit lead into
Philadelphia, his father arrived in Texas 17 points behind Bill
Clinton in the polls and the mean-spirited, divisive gathering
which followed was never really going to change things.
</P>
<P>
   Houston was the last time Ronald Reagan, the Republicans'
greatest icon, but now stricken with Alzheimer's disease, addressed
his party's convention. A bitter floorfight on abortion was
narrowly avoided, but it was open season for bashing
``skirt-chasing, draft-dodging'' Bill Clinton..
</P>
<P>
   The most vivid memory however is of the speech by Pat Buchanan,
the right-wing populist who had given President Bush a real scare
in the early 1992 primaries, and vowed to carry the fight against
``King George'' all the way.
</P>
<P>
   This year. Buchanan is safely confined to the Reform party. But
in Houston he gave a satanic performance. His language was cruel,
xenophobic and homophobic, verging on the openly racist.
</P>
<P>
   No Reaganesque `shining city on a hill' for him. Just the
promise of all-out war on the forces destroying America. ``Block by
block we must take back our cities, take back our culture and take
back our country.''
</P>
<P>
   In the hall they cheered, but the middle of the road voters were
appalled. The broad church of sunny Reagan Republicanism had shrunk
to a narrow claustrophobic barracks.
</P>
<P>
   Women voters in particular shunned the Republicans that year.
They had surrendered the vital center ground of American politics
to Clinton, and he never relinquished it.
</P>
<P>
   The overriding goal of both Republican conventions since has
been not to make the same mistake again.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego 1996 was a notably gentler occasion, but the strategy
didn't really work because Bob Dole, the nominee, was too far
behind in polls and temperamentally incapable of projecting fuzzy
optimism.
</P>
<P>
   That same fuzzy optimism is Bush junior's stock in trade. Every
sign is that however choreographed and stripped of real emotion,
the Philadelphia convention has succeeded in its aim of projecting
``compassionate conservatism'' as Republicanism's new guiding
spirit. &QL;

   PHILADELPHIA _ As the balloons descended into the air at three
minutes before eleven on Thursday night, the music struck up and
the fireworks went off to acclaim George W. Bush, the party's
candidate, it was hard to think of the Republican Convention in
Philadelphia as anything but the Greatest Show On Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Music, dancing, videos, ceaseless parties, and a parade of
characters from grandmothers in New Jersey through to Bo Derek had
been brought here for our lavish entertainment, creating that great
fusion of show business and sport which is American politics.
</P>
<P>
   But there was another side to the week, the hidden face of the
Republican machine which designed and steered every second, every
minute, every smile and whoop. A convention is also about political
control: it is Barnum and Bailey meets George Orwell.
</P>
<P>
   The convention's last day was a time for pulling out all of the
stops. Country singing duo Brooks and Dunn was brought on, the
latest in a line of musical entertainment which had included a
Philadelphia gospel choir, the Delfonics, Harold Melvin and the
Blue Notes, Cuban-born singer Joe Secada, Hank Williams, Jr. and a
dozen more. The audience sang along, cheered, clapped, waved their
hats and danced.
</P>
<P>
   And if they did not, there were always people there to make sure
that they livened it up just a little bit harder. This was a show
made for television, even if most of the networks chose not to show
more than a few minutes each day, and nothing was left to chance.
</P>
<P>
   From high in the rafters of the First Union Center, a team of
Republican controllers watched the proceedings on television sets
and with the aid of binoculars, scanning the arena for signs of
trouble or a lacklustre response.
</P>
<P>
   They communicated instantly with the whips on the floor, most
wearing orange baseball caps and spread among the different
delegations.
</P>
<P>
   Only once was there trouble, when some delegates objected to the
presence of a gay speaker; the rest of the time the whips were more
involved in making sure that the fun was as ostentatious as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   But it was emblematic of the very precise control exerted over
every aspect of life at the Republican convention. Every speech,
badge and T-shirt was vetted; every speaker carefully chosen to
make a point.
</P>
<P>
   You could have been forgiven for believing that this was a
predominantly black and Hispanic party; it is not.
</P>
<P>
   And the schedulers would never choose a white male politician to
make a point if they could find a minority spokesperson: the blind
mountaineer who opened the convention, the first deaf Miss America,
a Hispanic girl to represent the state of Texas or Bush's own black
preacher.
</P>
<P>
   That control was all-pervasive. Ask a delegate what they
thought, and the replies would be surprisingly similiar. The
reason: a set of speaking points which each had been issued with,
telling them that Bush was a uniter not a divider, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   The message was hammered home, over and over again. By the end
of the week, you could repeat it in your sleep.
</P>
<P>
   But if this all gave the impression of vacuity, it was not true.
Pushing home the message was a disciplined, precise task. It has
been guided by a vast team of communications professionals,
literally hundreds of people. They designed the podium.
</P>
<P>
   (``Materials such as lumber, wood-grained laminates in mahogany
and maple finishes, jade-green slate tiles and fresh flowers were
used to give the podium a warm and natural look,'' said the press
release.) They designed the speeches. And in the end, they also
designed the people.
</P>
<P>
   If all this gave the impression of politics without politics,
however, that was deliberate. Bush has campaigned as a man who is
more concerned with the real world than with Washington. But it
certainly did not mean that the politicians were idle in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   It was elsewhere that the real business was taking place, the
conversations which make politics turn in America.
</P>
<P>
   Up at the level of the suites, far above the thronging crowds,
the odor of expensive cologne mingled with the whiff of hors
d'oeuvres as businessmen entertained their politician friends with
shrimp, lobster, scotch, champagne and a little cold, hard cash.
</P>
<P>
   At this rarefied altitude, it became clearer how things really
worked.
</P>
<P>
   For $15,000 you could gain access to the luxury box of
Republican Chairman Jim Nicholson, and a number of companies had
thrown in their cash to buy a little space for their favorite
congressman or official: United Distillers and Vintners, for
instance, was sponsoring a box for Dennis Hastert, the Speaker of
the House.
</P>
<P>
   At one end of the stadium a discreet door led to the Victors'
Club, a haven for the really high rollers. And fenced off from the
rest of the convention, exclusive parties were staged for
contributors in a line of vintage railway cars hosted by House
Majority Whip Tom DeLay.
</P>
<P>
   While the good times rolled in the stadium, the money kept on
flowing: reporters from the Philadelphia Inquirer found a $5,000
check made out to one congressman lying on the ground, apparently
forgotten amidst the merry exchange of cash for favors.
</P>
<P>
   It is too easy to say that the money men run the show; after
all, if the party cannot convince the people seated at the top of
the stadium, the ``nosebleed seats,'' to vote for them, then all
the shrimp in the world will not matter.
</P>
<P>
   For a convention to work, money, media and political control
must be brought together in a perfect fusion; from that point of
view, the Republicans will have been well pleased with their week
in the City of Brotherly Love. &QL;

 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRAPPE, Md. _ As a presidential son of 40 years ago, I naturally
take special interest in the careers of others who have been in
similar situations. On the whole, I find it hard to understand why
a member of a president's family, aware of the often unjustified
criticism presidents endure, would voluntarily seek to occupy the
presidency. But those who do should be considered on their own
merits, not as reflections or psychological extensions of their
fathers.
</P>
<P>
   Many pundits have theorized that George W. Bush is seeking to
justify his father's administration after the defeat in 1992, and
looking for a chance to restore his family's honor. This assumption
may be natural, but it is unfair. The son of a president is his own
person, with his own ambitions and talents and views, as he
demonstrated on Thursday night in his nomination speech.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is the third presidential son in our history who has been
seriously considered by a major party for president. John Quincy
Adams, the son of John Adams, was elected president in 1824, and
Robert A. Taft, son of William Howard Taft, ran for the GOP
nomination in 1948 and 1952, though he never attained it. While
some other presidential offspring may have had some political
ambitions _ Robert Todd Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt Jr. come to
mind _ none got far down the road.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps by coincidence, all three who did were sons of
single-term presidents: John Adams was ousted from office by Thomas
Jefferson in 1800, William Howard Taft was a victim of Theodore
Roosevelt's Bull Moose party in 1912 and George H.W. Bush was
defeated for a second term by Bill Clinton in 1992. Perhaps there
is a psychology in these sons of ``getting back,'' a compulsion to
right what they perceive as a wrong. Such a feeling is
understandable.
</P>
<P>
   I can attest to how difficult it is for a presidential family to
leave the grandeur and heady atmosphere of the White House. That
regret must be vastly magnified when the family perceives the term
as having been cut short. The challenge for George W. Bush is one
of timing. He is running only eight short years after his father's
defeat by the man whose designated heir is his rival, and he has
had little time to carve out a political identity of his own.
</P>
<P>
   For the Adamses, 24 years elapsed between the departure of the
father from the White House and the arrival of the son. In the
years between, John Quincy Adams was continuously in governmental
service, minister to several foreign governments and a familiar
public figure. His father lived to see him elected but by then was
far removed from the political scene. For Robert Taft, it was 36
years after his father's departure from the presidency that he
first ran for the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In neither of these instances was there any temptation for the
candidate to draw on his father's administration to find aides.
</P>
<P>
   For George W. Bush, however, the circumstances smack of a
comeback and damage his credibility as an independent political
force.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there is an important similarity between him and his
historical antecedents. John Quincy Adams was 58 when he became
president (with a minority popular vote). Robert Taft was in his
50s when he made his first serious bid, against Thomas E. Dewey in
1948. Bush is in his early 50s, about 10 years older than John F.
Kennedy was in 1960. It is unjust to think of Bush as ``Junior.''
</P>
<P>
   He deserves to be rated on his own merits, and he should be
discouraging parental visibility in his campaign, a lesson he
learned after the disastrous New Hampshire primary. As we've seen
so far, George W. Bush can fight his own battles.
</P>

Times of General Winfield Scott'' and the forthcoming ``Yanks,''

<P>
   While sitting in a coffee shop the other day, I had an epiphany.
Surrounded by men and women cuddling their cell phones, it struck
me that these little metallic instruments are this millennium's
cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years ago my fellow coffee drinkers would have been
smoking. Back then, too, Manhattanites would have strolled through
the city holding cigarettes. Now they are clutching phones. Between
courses, and at the end of a meal, folks used to light up. Now it
is their little machines that light up. Before the cell phone,
theatergoers rushed to the lobby during intermissions simply for a
quick smoke. Now they hurry out to shout (the ``cell yell,'' it's
called) into their indispensable gadgets.
</P>
<P>
   What is it that makes these tiny devices so irresistible?
</P>
<P>
   It may be that, like cigarettes, cell phones provide something
to do with one's hands. Needless to say, like nicotine, the
machines are addictive. There is also the unfortunate matter of
pollution _ loud talk _ less lethal than second-hand smoke, but a
toxic irritant nonetheless. (``Hell is _ '' Sartre famously
observed, ``other people.'' And there are those periodic alarms
that the radiation the cell phones emit may be hazardous to your
physical health as well. Since, however, wireless companies offer
hundreds of free minutes, there is abundant motivation to go ahead
and chatter away, whatever the risks.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible, of course, that these ubiquitous toys are a
passing fad, like leisure suits, the Macarena and cigar bars.
Remember when kids used to inflict their boom boxes on bystanders
in public places? Eventually a code of etiquette (coupled with city
ordinances) caught up with the technology and it is rare now for
anyone not in a car to ``share'' his or her music.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps at some point soon it will be generally acknowledged
that rehearsing one's thoughts over the phone, like flossing one's
teeth or clipping one's nails (or, some would maintain, blowing
smoke), is more appropriately attended to in private.
</P>
<P>
   Such a humane development, at least to these aggravated ears,
would ring a gloriously welcome bell.

   POL-CONVENTIONS-REVIEW (Philadelphia) _ George W. Bush went a
long way at the Republican convention toward casting himself and
his party in a favorable light. But the event was, for the most
part, dull. Bush produced what was in effect an anti-commercial _
Don't Watch This! _ for Al Gore's upcoming Democratic convention.
Gore is getting much advice about what he should do to get his
candidacy on track, but it's not going to matter much if no one's
watching. By Adam Nagourney.

<P>
   TECH-SUITS-REVIEW (Undated) _ In a business culture that has
long fixated ambivalently on the image of computer wizards brewing
technological revolution in their garages, the backstory to two
digital copyright battles involving Napster and DVDs being waged in
federal courts on either coast has a familiar ring. They are either
tales of David vs. Goliath or of irresponsible hackers taking aim
at the establishment. Both cases have underscored the unprecedented
ability of individuals armed with digital technology to upset the
status quo. By Amy Harmon.

   AUGUST-NEWS-REVIEW (Undated) _ It's August, and things are
supposed to be slow and easy for public officials, business people
and journalists. But if the 1990s are any indication, August can be
the cruelest month for those who cherish international calm and
stable markets. A look at major news events that took place in
August in recent years. By Kurt M. Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   THIRD-PARTIES-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at third-party movements
in the history of U.S. presidential elections. They have seldom
played significant roles, except as occasional issue raisers and
spoilers. In a sense, third parties have played a vital role in
America's political system by expanding it and maybe, in a peculiar
way, preserving it. By Michael Janofsky.
</P>
<P>
   ELECTRIC-DEREG-REVIEW (Undated) _ Cheap, reliable electricity
was long taken for granted in the United States. Not anymore, at
least not in California. Four years ago, California decided to
deregulate its electric industry to promote competition, lower
prices and better service. This summer, power bills have doubled in
San Diego, blackouts have hit San Francisco, and the state has been
forced to cut off some big customers to protect the rest of its
power grid. The power supply is near collapse. By Alex Berenson.
</P>
<P>
   GOP-ROCK-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Republican National Convention
had two things in common with a World Wrestling Federation match:
the event was scripted and the outcome was never in doubt. The
champion known as The Rock was there to deliver unto the
conventioneers a voter registration message and to introduce House
Speaker Dennis Hastert, a former wrestling coach. By Richard
Sandomir.
</P>
<P>
   GOP-DONORS-REVIEW (Philadelphia) _ It began in 1988 with Team
100, made up of $100,000 contributors, when the elder George Bush
invented the Republicans' first elite donor club. Last week the GOP
convention was overrun by a stampede of 600 Team 100 members, who
were invited to take out those checkbooks and give the party
$250,000, the entry fee to the Republican Regents, the party's
newest and most exclusive donor club. By Don Van Natta.
</P>
<P>
   KILLER-KID-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Friends and acquaintances of
youths who kill often have heard boasts, plans for mayhem or seen
such warning signs as a fascination with guns. But they did nothing
to stop the crimes. The recently released testimony of teenagers
who knew one such killer, Michael Carneal of West Paducah, Ky.,
provide some insight.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   SPANGLISH-INTERNET-REVIEW (Undated) _ As Spanish speakers around
the world adopt computers and the Internet, they are importing
English technology-related words into their vocabulary. The
hybridization of Spanish and English into Spanglish is not new; it
has been accelerating for decades, irritating Spanish language
purists as well as Latin American nationalists who see the process
as more cultural infiltration from the United States. What's
different now is that authorities in much of the Latin world appear
to be throwing up their hands in the face of the latest English
invasion. By Sam Dillon.
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-ARABS-REVIEW (Cairo) _ At the urging of the
Palestinians, a few Arab leaders like Egypt's President Hosni
Mubarak and Jordan's King Abdullah have renewed the perennial call
for a summit conference of Arab leaders, this time billed an
emergency meeting for Arabs to regroup after the failure at Camp
David and to counter the U.S. spin that the breakdown was due
solely to Arab recalcitrance. The chimera of a united Arab front
continues to shimmer on the horizon _ and, suddenly, not just for
the Arabs. By Susan Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   BOLIVAR-VENEZUELA-REVIEW (Caracas) _ Throughout South America,
no figure is more revered and quoted than Simon Bolivar, who freed
the region from Spanish rule nearly 200 years ago. But Bolivar said
many different and often contradictory things. That means that
modern leaders like Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez have a whole
menu of positions from which to choose when they seek to justify
their own actions. By Larry Rohter.
</P>
<P>
   ZIMBABWE-MUGABE-REVIEW (Harare) _ In the West, Zimbabwe's
President Robert Mugabe is seen as a bloody despot and race-monger
who fuels the violence that churns through the countryside. But in
much of Africa, he is viewed as a hero trying to redress historical
wrongs. To many Westerners, these two conflicting views seem
impossible to reconcile. How can Mugabe be praised for pursuing an
honorable cause if he kills innocents along the way? By Rachel
Swarns.

<P>
   &UR; THE NAKED AND THE DEAD &LR;  By Norman Mailer. (Picador USA, $16.)
Norman Mailer was a young World War II veteran with a story to tell
in 1948 when this hefty novel, his first, was published. In The New
York Times Book Review, David Dempsey found it ``the most ambitious
novel to be written about the recent conflict'' and ``the most
ruthlessly honest.'' ```The Naked and the Dead' is not a great
book,'' this early evaluation concluded, ``but indisputably it
bears witness to a new and significant talent among American
novelists.'' The novel has been reissued in a 50th anniversary
edition with a new introduction by Mailer.
</P>
<P>
   Picador has also reissued  &UR; WHY ARE WE IN VIETNAM? &LR;  ($13), a
Mailer novel from 1967, when he was well established as a celebrity
writer. Vietnam itself is not mentioned until the last page of the
novel, which chronicles the Alaska hunting trip of two
soldiers-to-be, who set out to prove their virility in various
ways. Anatole Broyard said that it ``may be a third-rate work of
art, but it's a first-rate outrage to our sensibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ISAAC'S STORM &LR;  By Erik Larson. (Vintage, $13.) More than 6,000
people died in the hurricane that struck Galveston, Texas, in 1900;
the Isaac in question was Isaac M. Cline, chief of the U.S. Weather
Bureau's Galveston station. He ``survived his colossal misreading
of the situation on an impromptu raft,'' W. Jeffrey Bolster wrote
last year, adding that ``Larson never personifies nature, but he
sees poetry in weather.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ALICE SPRINGS &LR;  By Nikki Gemmell. (Penguin, $12.95.) A footloose
young artist journeys into the Australian outback to find her
mysterious father. The novel ``offers a whittled-down portrait of
external and internal landscapes under pressure,'' Elizabeth Graver
wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE VIEW FROM ALGER'S WINDOW: A Son's Memoir &LR;  By Tony Hiss.
(Vintage, $13.) The author was 7 years old when his father, Alger
Hiss, was accused of passing secrets to the Russians. By drawing on
hundreds of letters Alger Hiss sent from prison, the son takes up
his father's cause in what Ann Douglas last year called ``a
poignant, wonderfully written and deeply troubling memoir.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THOSE DAMN YANKEES: The Secret Life of America's Greatest
Franchise &LR;  By Dean Chadwin. (Verso, $15.) The author, a New York
lawyer, sees baseball's perennial overdogs as a malign influence on
the sport. He ``tackles his topic with a zealotry worthy of any
Kennedy conspiracy theorist,'' Allen St. John wrote last year. But
St. John finds the author's larger point ``muddled by his
anti-Yankee animus.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' championship season of two years ago, along with
the Mark McGwire-Sammy Sosa home-run derby, is celebrated in
 &UR; SUMMER OF '98 &LR;  by Mike Lupica (Contemporary Books, $14.95). The
book ``finds fresh ways of telling us history we have already lived
through,'' George Robinson wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; RIVER OF DARKNESS &LR;  By Rennie Airth. (Penguin, $6.99.) Surviving
the carnage of the third Battle of Ypres in World War I, a sergeant
major returns to Surrey's green and pleasant land as a psychopathic
killer. The Scotland Yard inspector on his trail is himself a
battle-scarred veteran. The novel ``has balanced savagery and
civilization neatly, and given civilization just the barest edge,''
Christopher Dickey wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE ACCIDENTAL BRIDE &LR;  By Janice Harayda. (St. Martin's Griffin,
$13.95.) In this comedy of contemporary manners, Lily Blair, a
newspaper reporter, is about to marry the third-richest man in the
second-largest city in Ohio when she is torn between the security
of married suburban life and following her career dreams to New
York. This first novel is ``devoid of the delicious tension that
infuses books like `Pride and Prejudice,''' Maggie Galehouse wrote
last year. But she praised the author as ``an astute social
commentator.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LATER AUDEN &LR;  By Edward Mendelson. (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux,
$17.) The work of W.H. Auden rather than the life dominates this
second of two biographical volumes by his literary executor and the
editor of his collected works. The author ``makes Auden dull, a
mere clerk of the emotions,'' William Logan wrote last year, though
he found that ``Mendelson's readings fathom the poem phrase by
phrase, and even the footnotes are lively with criticism.''
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has also released  &UR; EARLY AUDEN &LR;  ($16),
covering the poet's life until he left England for New York in
1939. ``Mendelson is informative on the early influences,'' Denis
Donoghue wrote in 1981.

requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-to,

list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and

criticism from publishing houses.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   The traditional British actor is defined by a booming voice, a
commanding presence and the kind of flamboyant, scenery-chewing
brio that made Laurence Olivier, Richard Burton and Kenneth Branagh
legends.
</P>
<P>
   What irony, then, that Sir Alec Guinness, one of the finest
actors England ever produced, was a chameleonic performer who could
merge himself almost unrecognizably into any role, one who never
boomed when a murmur would do, one who seemed readier to blend into
the scenery than to chew it _ and yet who somehow made a bigger
impression on audiences than practically any of his peers. Guinness
died Saturday at 86. The cause of death was not revealed, but news
reports Monday said he was battling liver cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In a career spanning more than five decades, Guinness was never
bigger than the characters he played, but nonetheless cast a long
shadow over several generations of actors.
</P>
<P>
   To many, in fact, he was the best actor of his age, a master of
anything from Shakespeare to soap opera _ even if he was most
likely doomed to be forever remembered as Obi-Wan Kenobi.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most remarkable thing about Guinness was his
preternatural mildness, on and offscreen. It seemed almost fitting
that the actor who wrote a book entitled ``My Name Escapes Me''
(Viking Books, 1997) should be the only performer ever to win an
Academy Award for Best Actor for a movie in which his name was
misspelled in the opening titles.
</P>
<P>
   Born in London on April 2, 1914, as Alexander Guinness de Cuffe,
Guinness originally planned a more dependable career as an
advertising writer, but soon gravitated to the theater. Making his
London debut in 1934, he quickly made a name for himself in
classical drama. The actor/director John Gielgud signed him for his
company in 1937, and Guinness spent the next decade on stage.
</P>
<P>
   Though he had had a minor role in ``Evensong'' (1934), it wasn't
until director David Lean cast him in two Dickens adaptations _
``Great Expectations'' (1946) and ``Oliver Twist'' (1948) _ that
Guinness really reached the silver screen. Particularly in the
latter, as a mesmerizingly corrupt Fagin, Guinness demonstrated an
understated style that perfectly suited the up-close-and-personal
approach of film.
</P>
<P>
   It was in a string of Ealing Studios comedies that Guinness
first caught the eye of American audiences. Low-budget but deftly
written and usually spiced with black comedy, such films as ``The
Man in the White Suit'' (1951), ``The Captain's Paradise'' (1953)
and ``The Ladykillers'' (1955) were perfect vehicles for his
low-key, impeccably timed humor.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the Ealing films showed him to particular advantage:
``Kind Hearts and Coronets'' (1949) was the story of a young man
scheming to murder his way to a noble title, with Guinness playing
all eight murder victims, while his performance as a meek bank
clerk secretly plotting a spectacular robbery in ``The Lavender
Hill Mob'' (1951) earned him an Oscar nomination as Best Actor _ a
rare feat for an actor in a foreign film.
</P>
<P>
   But by this time Guinness was as marketable in America and
internationally as he was in England, and for the next several
decades he appeared in a number of big-budget, high-profile films,
usually in prominent roles that transcended character acting _ he
managed to be a star without looking like one.
</P>
<P>
   The most impressive were four he did for Lean, his first
champion and always his favorite director. ``The Bridge on the
River Kwai'' (1957), ``Lawrence of Arabia'' (1962), ``Doctor
Zhivago'' (1965) and ``A Passage to India'' (1984) proved that,
paradoxically, an actor as physically small as Guinness could work
on Lean's epic screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bridge on the River Kwai'' offered Guinness his greatest
role _ albeit one that he initially rejected as unplayable. As the
ramrod-stiff commander of a troop of British soldiers in a Japanese
prison camp, he managed to come across as punctilious, arrogant and
deluded _ and yet somehow hugely sympathetic as well. The role won
him the Academy Award as Best Actor, even though he was identified
in the opening credits as ``Alec Guiness.''
</P>
<P>
   As he aged, Guinness continued to find memorable roles. After
portraying the elderly but noble jedi knight Obi-Wan Kenobi in
``Star Wars'' (1977) and two sequels, he turned his gray, everyman
quality to good advantage as spymaster George Smiley in two
television adaptations of John Le Carre novels, ``Tinker, Tailor,
Soldier, Spy'' (1980) and ``Smiley's People'' (1982). He returned
to Dickens for the epic-length ``Little Dorrit'' (1986),
registering an impeccable performance as the heroine's
debt-imprisoned father, earning his second Oscar nomination as Best
Supporting Actor.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s Guinness moved gradually into retirement _ his
memory, he explained, was simply no longer up to the demands of
acting. Instead he returned to an earlier love, writing _ he'd
starred in his own stage adaptation of ``The Brothers Karamazov''
in 1946 and earned an Oscar nomination for his script for ``The
Horse's Mouth'' (1958).
</P>
<P>
   Guinness produced a memoir, ``Blessings in Disguise'' (Viking
Press, 1985) and two published diaries _ ``My Name Escapes Me'' and
``A Positively Final Appearance'' (Viking Press, 1999) _ which
demonstrated the same self-effacing charm that had characterized
his work on stage and screen.
</P>
<P>
   And if it was his destiny to be remembered as a jedi knight, he
didn't particularly mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rather surprising to me that I should be remembered at
all,'' he told an interviewer in 1995. ``It might as well be for
that as anything else.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL SIDEBAR FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
   SIDEBAR: OBI-WAN AND THEN SOME
</P>
<P>
   Most of Alec Guinness' best films can be found on videocassette,
and a few on laser disk or DVD. A greatest-hits sampling might
include the following six films:
</P>
<P>
   ``KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS'' (1949).
</P>
<P>
   Guinness' flamboyant eight-role performance is matched by Dennis
Price's deadpan narration in a seminal British black comedy that
inspired everyone from Peter Sellers to Monty Python. Price is out
to knock off the eight relatives who stand between him and an
aristocratic fortune _ with Guinness playing all eight. Our
favorite: Lady Agatha.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE LAVENDER HILL MOB'' (1951).
</P>
<P>
   No one could play timid nebbishes like Guinness, and this
delightful tale of a shy bank clerk plotting to rob a gold truck
suits him to a T. Full of understated British humor and subtle
character interaction, with a great supporting turn by Stanley
Holloway _ ``My Fair Lady's'' Alfie Doolittle. Don't blink in the
opening cafe scene, or you'll miss an astoundingly young Audrey
Hepburn.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI'' (1957).
</P>
<P>
   From the moment the brisk Col. Nicholson struts into a remote
Japanese work camp at the head of a column of bedraggled British
prisoners, it's clear that Guinness is at the top of his game.
There's a lot going on in what may be David Lean's finest film, but
its core is a battle of wills between Nicholson and the Japanese
commander (Sessue Hayakawa, in a memorable, Oscar-nominated
performance). Guinness, who won the Academy Award as Best Actor for
his performance, is infuriating, inspiring and ultimately sad in a
performance that stays on track right down to the doubly ironic
ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE HORSE'S MOUTH'' (1958).
</P>
<P>
   Guinness also scripted this offbeat adaptation of Joyce Cary's
novel. As an eccentric painter who lives well outside the
boundaries of conventional society, he delivers one of his finest
performances. Ronald Neame's light directorial hand is just right
for a film that's as much a character portrait as a narrative.
</P>
<P>
   ``SMILEY'S PEOPLE'' (1982).
</P>
<P>
   John Le Carre's George Smiley is the ultimate rebuttal to James
Bond, a meticulous bureaucrat whose greatest gift happens to lie in
the minutiae of spycraft. In this television miniseries and its
predecessor, ``Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy'' (1980), Guinness
makes Smiley so utterly believable _ and, in the final analysis, so
deeply sad _ that Mr. Bond might as well put away his license and
go home. Guinness' immensely detailed portrayal needs all of its
six hours to convey its full impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``STAR WARS'' (1977).
</P>
<P>
   Amid a cast of brash, young actors, director George Lucas
cannily placed Guinness as Old Ben Kenobi, the sun-creased desert
rat whose placid exterior masks his past as Obi-Wan Kenobi, once
and future jedi knight. Guinness had to wait until he was 63 to get
a worthwhile swashbuckling scene, but he makes the most of it.
After watching this Oscar-nominated performance, revisit ``Star
Wars: The Phantom Menace'' (1999) to appreciate Ewan McGregor's
skillful emulation of Guinness' performance for his role as the
young Obi-Wan.

Zhivago'' (1965) and ``A Passage to India'' (1984) proved that,
paradoxically, an actor as physically small as Guinness could work
on Lean's epic screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bridge on the River Kwai'' offered Guinness his greatest
role _ albeit one that he initially rejected as unplayable. As the
ramrod-stiff commander of a troop of British soldiers in a Japanese
prison camp, he managed to come across as punctilious, arrogant and
deluded _ and yet somehow hugely sympathetic as well. The role won
him the Academy Award as Best Actor, even though he was identified
in the opening credits as ``Alec Guiness.''
</P>
<P>
   As he aged, Guinness continued to find memorable roles. After
portraying the elderly but noble jedi knight Obi-Wan Kenobi in
``Star Wars'' (1977) and two sequels, he turned his gray, everyman
quality to good advantage as spymaster George Smiley in two
television adaptations of John Le Carre novels, ``Tinker, Tailor,
Soldier, Spy'' (1980) and ``Smiley's People'' (1982). He returned
to Dickens for the epic-length ``Little Dorrit'' (1986),
registering an impeccable performance as the heroine's
debt-imprisoned father, earning his second Oscar nomination as Best
Supporting Actor.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s Guinness moved gradually into retirement _ his
memory, he explained, was simply no longer up to the demands of
acting. Instead he returned to an earlier love, writing _ he'd
starred in his own stage adaptation of ``The Brothers Karamazov''
in 1946 and earned an Oscar nomination for his script for ``The
Horse's Mouth'' (1958).
</P>
<P>
   Guinness produced a memoir, ``Blessings in Disguise'' (Viking
Press, 1985) and two published diaries _ ``My Name Escapes Me'' and
``A Positively Final Appearance'' (Viking Press, 1999) _ which
demonstrated the same self-effacing charm that had characterized
his work on stage and screen.
</P>
<P>
   And if it was his destiny to be remembered as a jedi knight, he
didn't particularly mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rather surprising to me that I should be remembered at
all,'' he told an interviewer in 1995. ``It might as well be for
that as anything else.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   SIDEBAR: OBI-WAN AND THEN SOME
</P>
<P>
   Most of Alec Guinness' best films can be found on videocassette,
and a few on laser disk or DVD. A greatest-hits sampling might
include the following six films:
</P>
<P>
   ``KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS'' (1949).
</P>
<P>
   Guinness' flamboyant eight-role performance is matched by Dennis
Price's deadpan narration in a seminal British black comedy that
inspired everyone from Peter Sellers to Monty Python. Price is out
to knock off the eight relatives who stand between him and an
aristocratic fortune _ with Guinness playing all eight. Our
favorite: Lady Agatha.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE LAVENDER HILL MOB'' (1951).
</P>
<P>
   No one could play timid nebbishes like Guinness, and this
delightful tale of a shy bank clerk plotting to rob a gold truck
suits him to a T. Full of understated British humor and subtle
character interaction, with a great supporting turn by Stanley
Holloway _ ``My Fair Lady's'' Alfie Doolittle. Don't blink in the
opening cafe scene, or you'll miss an astoundingly young Audrey
Hepburn.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI'' (1957).
</P>
<P>
   From the moment the brisk Col. Nicholson struts into a remote
Japanese work camp at the head of a column of bedraggled British
prisoners, it's clear that Guinness is at the top of his game.
There's a lot going on in what may be David Lean's finest film, but
its core is a battle of wills between Nicholson and the Japanese
commander (Sessue Hayakawa, in a memorable, Oscar-nominated
performance). Guinness, who won the Academy Award as Best Actor for
his performance, is infuriating, inspiring and ultimately sad in a
performance that stays on track right down to the doubly ironic
ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE HORSE'S MOUTH'' (1958).
</P>
<P>
   Guinness also scripted this offbeat adaptation of Joyce Cary's
novel. As an eccentric painter who lives well outside the
boundaries of conventional society, he delivers one of his finest
performances. Ronald Neame's light directorial hand is just right
for a film that's as much a character portrait as a narrative.
</P>
<P>
   ``SMILEY'S PEOPLE'' (1982).
</P>
<P>
   John Le Carre's George Smiley is the ultimate rebuttal to James
Bond, a meticulous bureaucrat whose greatest gift happens to lie in
the minutiae of spycraft. In this television miniseries and its
predecessor, ``Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy'' (1980), Guinness
makes Smiley so utterly believable _ and, in the final analysis, so
deeply sad _ that Mr. Bond might as well put away his license and
go home. Guinness' immensely detailed portrayal needs all of its
six hours to convey its full impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``STAR WARS'' (1977).
</P>
<P>
   Amid a cast of brash, young actors, director George Lucas
cannily placed Guinness as Old Ben Kenobi, the sun-creased desert
rat whose placid exterior masks his past as Obi-Wan Kenobi, once
and future jedi knight. Guinness had to wait until he was 63 to get
a worthwhile swashbuckling scene, but he makes the most of it.
After watching this Oscar-nominated performance, revisit ``Star
Wars: The Phantom Menace'' (1999) to appreciate Ewan McGregor's
skillful emulation of Guinness' performance for his role as the
young Obi-Wan.

ALEC GUINNESS: A MASTERPIECE OF UNDERSTATEMENT

  Includes a 450-word sidebar

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A 1,400-word appreciation of actor Alec Guinness by Gayden Wren,
entertainment editor for The New York Times Syndicate, has moved on
the ``e'' entertainment category.
</P>
<P>
   Wren writes: ``The traditional British actor is defined by a
booming voice, a commanding presence and the kind of flamboyant,
scenery-chewing brio that made Laurence Olivier, Richard Burton and
Kenneth Branagh legends.
</P>
<P>
   ``What irony, then, that one of the finest actors England ever
produced was a chameleonic performer who could merge himself almost
unrecognizably into any role, one who never boomed when a murmur
would do, one who seemed readier to blend into the scenery than to
chew it _ and yet who somehow made a bigger impression on audiences
than practically any of his peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a career spanning more than five decades, Sir Alec Guinness
was never bigger than the characters he played, but nonetheless
cast a long shadow over several generations of actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``To many, in fact, he was the best actor of his age, a master
of anything from Shakespeare to soap opera _ even if he was most
likely doomed to be forever remembered as Obi-Wan Kenobi.''
</P>
<P>
   Includes a sidebar with recommendations of Guinness' six best
films available on video.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Is Bush's pedigree critical?
 &HT;    For release Aug. 9, 2000
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Far be it from me to pillage others for knee-jerk reactions
without recognizing that I, too, often am guilty of such
reverberations, as are almost all of us.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, I have been bristling about some post-Republican
convention knee-jerking regarding George W. Bush that I find to be
unfair. Say what you want about Bush (my thoughts remain in
opposition to his election) but some radio talk hosts and
columnists need to get over that ``silver spoon'' image they are
trying to hang on the Republican candidate.
</P>
<P>
   First, the same could be said of Al Gore; he wasn't exactly born
in one of those celebrated Tennessee log cabins.
</P>
<P>
   But more important is the argument by these antagonists that
Bush, delivered at birth with an oily but silver spoon in his
mouth, cannot relate to the poorer classes of Americans because he
never was in their class, never suffered, never was deprived of
anything.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they contend, anyone born of the historically wealthy
Bush-Pierce-Walker clans correlates only to his peers and, thus,
can travel only in the environment of Big Oil, investment banking
and the steel industry.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, it was Bush's acceptance speech that touched off the
reaction. After all, he did sound more like an earthy Democrat than
a Republican, espousing all that social compassion rather than the
desk-pounding rightist rhetoric of the old Newt Gingrich gang.
</P>
<P>
   But there certainly is precedence for an affluent president not
only to reach out to the quote, masses, unquote but to actually do
something about it. Anyone ever hear of Franklin Delano Roosevelt
and John F. Kennedy? For every humble beginning of a Lincoln,
Truman or Nixon, there is a rich man elected to the White House.
That does not foreclose on his ability or desire to do something
for people not born of his privilege.
</P>
<P>
   There are things about George W. with which I do not agree, but
his pedigree is not one of them. (Do not mistake me for a rich kid
either; my father drove a laundry truck then later sold throwaway
pillows.)
</P>
<P>
   Surely, FDR was among the most privileged of people to assume
the presidency, but his measures on behalf of the working class,
particularly the inception of the Social Security system, stood him
in the forefront of champions of the average (or lesser) American
citizen.
</P>
<P>
   JFK to this day is remembered as the president who launched long
overdue civil rights legislation and other major social programs
that were enacted during the succeeding Lyndon Johnson
administration. Brothers Bobby and Teddy likely ate their first
strained baby food from a gold spoon rather than a silver one, but
their political records are squarely on the side of the unrich.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Bush advocates a considerable number of stereotypical
GOP upper class causes, but that does not prevent him from being
similarly inclined to helping the poorer strata of America.
</P>
<P>
   There are some of us who believe his compassion from the pulpit
last week was more theater than reality and that, even if we're
wrong in that contention and Bush is sincere, it's not going to be
easy to push stronger social legislation through his more rigid
conservative compadres in the Congress. At least not until their
own fiscal agenda is achieved, after which little will be left for
the others.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, with his denim shirts and boots, likes to reflect a
down-to-earth guy who will continue to be that way in the White
House. Maybe that is the real him. His father certainly carried
himself that way and his mother is the epitome of the nice lady who
left a pie in the window sill.
</P>
<P>
   Those harshly opposed to George W. refuse to see the denim,
instead see only his Texas oil-rich experience without also
realizing that Lyndon Johnson, despite his youth as an elevator
operator, car washer, field hand and cafe worker, mixed well with
the Texas oil folks himself.
</P>
<P>
   Bush should be judged on his programs, when and if you sort out
what he can and cannot do. His pedigree is immaterial. We have
learned from presidents in the past that it matters not from where
you came, but where you are going.

ON THE LANGUAGE OF CERVANTES, THE IMPRINT OF THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)  
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Cindy Flores Davalos, a 24-year-old Mexican with
neon pink hair, speaks native Spanish and minimal English. But in
her job as the editor of a women's ``channel'' at Elsitio.com, an
Internet company here, she operates in a linguistic netherworld
that experts call Cyber-Spanglish.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at her computer, Flores keeps her hand on ``el maus,''
which she uses to ``clickear'' on the icons on her screen. She
loves to ``chatear'' with her clients online, and when someone
sends her an intriguing ``imail,'' she may ``forwardear'' it to a
friend. Her instantaneous e-mail service, AOL's ICQ (named for the
play on ``I seek you''), gets this rave review: ``I love to
ICQuear'' (pronounced eye-see-kay-YAR).
</P>
<P>
   ``Our daily routine obliges us to work in English,'' Flores said
in Spanish. ``The force of English on the computer screen is
overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   Flores' linguistic experience is shared by millions of Hispanics
who are adopting computers and the Internet as the tools and toys
of daily life. From Mexico to Madrid and from Tijuana to Tierra del
Fuego, Spanish-speakers are freely importing English
technology-related words into their vocabulary. They ``taipear''
rather than ``escribir a maquina.'' When they save a file, they
make ``el backup.'' And when their computer jams, it is time to
``resetear.'' Pronunciations tend to retain the simplicity of
American vowels _ the first syllable of ``brainstormear,'' for
instance, is usually said brayn, rather than bry-een.
</P>
<P>
   The hybridization of Spanish and English into Spanglish is not
new, of course. It has been accelerating for half a century, and
has often irritated Latin nationalists who see the process as
cultural infiltration from the United States, as well as purists
who think the mother tongue of Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra is
quite nice in its classic form, gracias. What is different now,
experts say, is that linguistic gatekeepers in much of the Latin
world appear to be throwing up their hands in the face of the
latest English invasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a hard-fought battle from the '60s through the
'80s,'' said Jose Carreno Carlon, director of the department of
communication at the Iberoamerican University in Mexico City. ``But
the nationalists and purists are in retreat, especially because in
the cybernetic world many English words have no easy equivalent.''
</P>
<P>
   Without a doubt, many computer-related words _ ``click,'' for
instance _ resist neat translation. But Ilan Stavans, a
Mexican-born professor of Spanish at Amherst College who has
compiled a forthcoming dictionary of Spanglish terms, says there is
another reason for the quick welcome given to many English terms
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a shift in the cultural climate not only in Mexico,
but all over Latin America and Spain,'' Stavans said, noting that
the left had once held intellectual sway there. ``Before the fall
of the Berlin Wall, everything that came from the imperialist
gringo had to be rejected. But attitudes have become more receptive
to U.S. popular culture, especially among the middle classes. They
don't reject, they absorb.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 10 percent of the 6,000 hybrid terms Stavans has collected
are Cyber-Spanglish, underlining the Internet culture's growing
influence in the Hispanic world.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is expected to have 128 million Internet users
by 2001. There are far fewer users in Latin America and Spain, but
the number is rising rapidly. Some 2.7 million Mexicans will be
wired into the Internet by year's end, says Marc Alexander, an
analyst at IDC, an American Internet market research company, and
Mexican users are increasing by 50 percent annually. In all of
Latin America, there are now 13.2 million Internet users, up from
8.4 million last year. Nine million Spaniards are now wired.
(English is also bending the Portuguese of Brazil, South America's
largest Internet market.)
</P>
<P>
   The rapid growth has made cyberspace the linguistic crucible
that a century ago was centered on America's southwest border and
later in cities like Miami and New York, where Latinos intending to
drive their trucks to market began saying ``Voy a manejar mi troca
a la marketa'' instead of the ``Voy a manejar mi camion al
mercado.''
</P>
<P>
   In more recent decades, Spanglish was fed by English-language
movies, radio and television broadcasts, and advertising. In 1982,
President Jose Lopez Portillo tried to turn back the tide by
creating the Commission for the Defense of the Spanish Language,
which campaigned to rid Mexico City billboards of words like
hamburgers and pub.
</P>
<P>
   ``People rejected that purist campaign,'' said Dr. Tarsicio
Herrera Zapien, the professor of classical letters who is secretary
of the prestigious Academia Mexicana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Languages evolve, and we don't need to fight for Spanish if it
is alive,'' said Herrera.
</P>
<P>
   The Academia Mexicana was set up 125 years ago, its statutes
say, to ``seek the conservation, purity and perfection of the
Spanish language'' in Mexico. But in recent years, Herrera says,
its members have put less focus on purity and will likely do
nothing to prevent the use of Cyber-Spanglish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't legislate how people speak,'' said Herrera. ``We
simply catalog Mexican usages.''
</P>
<P>
   The Academia Mexicana is one of 20 organizations in Latin
America affiliated with the Real Academia Espanola (Royal Spanish
Academy) in Madrid, established in 1713 to protect Castilian
Spanish from an earlier source of linguistic pollution: words
derived from Quechua, Nahuatl and other indigenous tongues were
being incorporated into Latin American speech.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage the use of proper Spanish, the Real Academia has
established a Web site at www.rae.es. It offers an interactive
service, Espanol al Dia, to answer questions about the correct use
of Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Tascon, the editor of El Pais Digital, the Internet
version of Spain's largest newspaper, says the Real Academia has
urged Spaniards to resist the English onslaught by seeking correct
Spanish translations of computer-related terms, a practice he tries
to follow as an editor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't use el atachment,'' Tascon said. ``We use archivo
adjunto, which is longer, but at least it's Spanish. We try to use
el sitio instead of el site, but that's a battle.'' Half the papers
in Spain now routinely use el site, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes English words just force their way into general
use,'' he said. ``We try to get people to use `charlar,' for
instance, but they say `chatear' anyway.''

</P>
<P>
   The Academia Mexicana is one of 20 organizations in Latin
America affiliated with the Real Academia Espanola (Royal Spanish
Academy) in Madrid, established in 1713 to protect Castilian
Spanish from an earlier source of linguistic pollution: words
derived from Quechua, Nahuatl and other indigenous tongues were
being incorporated into Latin American speech.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage the use of proper Spanish, the Real Academia has
established a Web site at www.rae.es. It offers an interactive
service, Espanol al Dia, to answer questions about the correct use
of Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Tascon, the editor of El Pais Digital, the Internet
version of Spain's largest newspaper, says the Real Academia has
urged Spaniards to resist the English onslaught by seeking correct
Spanish translations of computer-related terms, a practice he tries
to follow as an editor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't use el atachment,'' Tascon said. ``We use archivo
adjunto, which is longer, but at least it's Spanish. We try to use
el sitio instead of el site, but that's a battle.'' Half the papers
in Spain now routinely use el site, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes English words just force their way into general
use,'' he said. ``We try to get people to use `charlar,' for
instance, but they say `chatear' anyway.''

VENEZUELA'S LEADER USES AN ICON FOR HIS OWN ENDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)

<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ There is hardly a town in Latin America
that does not have a street or school or square named for Simon
Bolivar, the Great Liberator, who freed South America from Spanish
rule nearly 200 years ago. Two countries now bear his name, as does
the currency here in Venezuela, his native land, now officially
known as the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. Throughout the
region, no figure is more universally revered or quoted.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarkable career as a general and statesman, Bolivar
said many different and often contradictory things. That means that
modern political leaders like Hugo Chavez, who was certified here
Friday for a new six-year term as president, have a whole menu of
positions from which to choose when they seek to legitimize or
justify their own actions.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez himself is something of a mystery to much of the world _
a charismatic populist who is at the same time a military man, a
leftist, a sloganeer and above all an enthusiastic wielder of
power. To try to get a grip on what a complicated leader really is
like, it is sometimes useful to take a look at the heroes and
symbols he tries to exploit. In Chavez's case, the most important
of these is Bolivar.
</P>
<P>
   But which Bolivar?
</P>
<P>
   There is one Bolivar, for instance, who praised democracy as
``the most sacred source'' of power, but there is also another who
once proclaimed that ``necessity recognizes no laws.'' One Bolivar
admired George Washington as the ideal ``citizen-hero'' who ``fills
my bosom with emulation,'' while another famously and bitterly
remarked that ``the United States seems destined by providence to
plague Latin America with misery in the name of liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez describes himself as a disciple of Bolivar, and some of
his more ardent followers have gone so far as to suggest he is the
``reincarnation of the Liberator.'' But his vision of Bolivar is
one ``very much adapted to his own purposes,'' said Jesus Sanoja
Hernandez, a prominent political commentator here. Even before
coming to power 18 months ago, Chavez, a former army colonel who in
1992 led an unsuccessful coup attempt, made it clear that ``the
Bolivar he likes is the one who centralized power,'' said Dr.
Guillermo Moron, one of Venezuela's leading historians and experts
on Bolivar. ``The Bolivar that the opposition likes, in contrast,
is the one who respected the law, consulted even his enemies and
tried to create an impartial system of justice for all.``
</P>
<P>
   In a society as deeply divided by class, geography and race as
modern Venezuela, Bolivar, who was born here in 1783, has always
been an important symbol of national unity and identity. ``All
Venezuelans are Bolivarians by definition, because he is the only
great man this country has ever produced,'' said Moron.
</P>
<P>
   But Chavez's efforts to appropriate Bolivar as his personal
symbol have worked to further polarize society _ for example, when
he brandished Bolivar's sword as he criticized opponents during the
recent election campaign here. The result is a situation in which,
as the Bolivar scholar Manuel Caballero puts it, ``every enemy of
the government is thereby an enemy of Bolivar and thus excluded
from the Venezuelan community.''
</P>
<P>
   Precisely because Bolivar is a national icon who is supposed to
be above partisan battles, Venezuelan law prohibits any political
party from including his name in its official title. But Chavez has
at times come perilously close to ignoring that restriction,
originally designating his organization the Bolivarian
Revolutionary Movement and even now calling his program to expand
the role of the military the ``Plan Bolivar 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of his most recent initiatives has been the creation
of what he calls ``Bolivarian schools,'' complete with lunch
programs and medical care for poor children. That program, however,
quickly provoked controversy when it became clear that the
curriculum was to include military training for students and that
textbooks on the history of Venezuela were going to be rewritten to
suit Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   Bolivar is not the only hero of Latin American independence to
be subjected to such historical revisionism. Cuba provides perhaps
an even more glaring example: Fidel Castro manipulates the writings
of Jose Marti for his own ends, as does the Cuban exile community
in Miami and even the United States government, through its
broadcasts on Radio and TV Marti.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Venezuela's borders, Chavez's use of Bolivarian ideals
has been even more confusing and contradictory. Bolivar proclaimed
that ``Our country is America,'' and Chavez has repeatedly endorsed
the concept of regional integration. He has pushed for a South
Atlantic version of NATO, only to be met by the skepticism of
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks largely to Chavez, it seems to be the left that is
getting the most mileage out of Bolivar in nearby countries in
Latin America at the moment. The political party recently formed by
Colombia's main Marxist guerrilla group bears Bolivar's name, and
the populist-nationalist colonels who joined with Indians to
overthrow President Jamil Mahuad of Ecuador in January have also
described themselves as followers of Bolivar.
</P>
<P>
   But Chavez also unilaterally closed his country's border to
Colombian truckers and then defied the Andean Community when the
group ruled that such an action was illegal. He has persistently
flirted with the guerrillas who are seeking to overthrow Colombia's
democratically elected government; he has failed to condemn the
recent military coup in Ecuador, and he now seems to want to revive
a dormant border dispute with neighboring Guyana.
</P>
<P>
   So as the 21st century begins, Bolivar, a product of the
18th-century Enlightenment, plays a more important role in the
daily politics of his homeland than Washington or even Jefferson do
in the United States. Yet lurking in the background is the prospect
that the Bolivarian revival Chavez is sponsoring could end up
perpetuating one of the Liberator's most famous prophecies.
``America is ungovernable,'' he said just a few weeks before his
death in Colombia in 1830. ``He who serves the revolution plows the
sea.''

THE WEST SEES ONE MUGABE, BUT AFRICA SEES ANOTHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)  
 By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe _ To the West, he is an aging despot with
bloody hands, a brutal race-monger who terrorizes white farmers and
black critics and fuels the violence that still churns through the
countryside. But on this continent, many Africans are painting a
strikingly different portrait of Zimbabwe's President Robert
Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
   In South Africa, 54 percent of blacks in a recent survey said
they supported the invasions of white-owned farms here. In Namibia,
the prime minister praised Mugabe for highlighting the racial
inequities in regional land ownership. And in Nigeria, a newspaper
assailed the West for trying to demonize an African leader intent
on redressing a historical wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Westerners might find this alternative view of Mugabe jarring.
How can the villain also be a hero? How can he be praised for
pursuing an honorable cause if his supporters commit murder? And as
a result, even in the barrage of foreign media coverage about the
crisis in Zimbabwe, little but condemnation for Mugabe is heard.
Other opinions are dismissed as those of apologists, collaborators
or worse.
</P>
<P>
   But in truth, the perceptual dissonance reflects mostly the
lingering impact of this continent's painful colonial history on
the modern-day lives of black Africans. The white regimes have been
swept away, but all across Africa, the single most valuable and
plentiful resource _ land _ remains in the hands of tiny white
minorities. ``The media is highlighting the issue of violence,''
said Richard Sakala, a spokesman for President Frederick Chiluba of
Zambia, last week. ``But I don't think they're talking about the
core issue, about how land is distributed in that country.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, white rule ended in Zimbabwe, formerly Rhodesia, but
today, whites _ who make up less than 2 percent of the population _
still control more than half of the arable farmland. The black
majority ekes out a living in overcrowded tracts of stony soil. In
six-year-old post-apartheid South Africa, blacks make up 75 percent
of the population but occupy only 15 percent of the land. In
Namibia, nearly 10 years into independence, some 4,000 whites own
about 44 percent of the territory.
</P>
<P>
   The racial disparities are achingly visible in Zimbabwe's
rolling hills and lush valleys. More than 60 percent of the blacks
in this country live off tiny slivers of land, growing their own
food, going hungry when the soil wears out. Old people tell stories
and sing songs about how the best land was taken by British
settlers around the turn of the century. Today, from their meager
plots, these struggling peasants can often see and envy the vast,
fertile farms of the whites.
</P>
<P>
   So while most blacks condemn the political violence, many
welcome the spotlight that Mugabe has drawn to the land question,
his pointed reminder that white settlers stole this land. And even
in the highly urbanized cities, which voted overwhelmingly against
Mugabe's governing party in June's parliamentary elections, that
reality retains its bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, of course, Mugabe has not always been the
champion of the landless. He officially abandoned Marxism in the
mid-1990s and has used the promise of land reform mainly to curry
favor with rural voters at election time. He blames whites for the
slow pace of change, but his own government has lacked the
political will, the administrative capacity and the cash to make
land reform a reality. His government's announcement last week that
it would take over 3,000 farms seemed calculated more to rile white
farmers than to outline an immediately feasible plan.
</P>
<P>
   Some Africans, notably Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu, have
sharply criticized Mugabe, calling for an immediate end to the farm
invasions and the violence that has claimed the lives of as many as
30 government critics before the June elections. (Today, black
squatters still occupy about 1,000 farms.) A strike last week by
Zimbabwe's black unions and white business owners to protest the
farm invasions brought the nation to a one-day standstill.
</P>
<P>
   But even those blacks who speak harshly of Mugabe's violent
tactics recognize that the desperation for land is real. And some
suspect that the harsh criticism from the West may be fueled, in
part, by those who want to maintain the status quo. ``The power of
the white settler lobby should not be underrated,'' the East
African, a newspaper based in Kenya, warned in an editorial last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign aid donors and white farmers here agree that 2 million
acres of fallow land should be turned over to black peasants. But
despite the assurances from white farmers that they support land
redistribution, they have repeatedly failed to systematically
identify tracts available for sale.
</P>
<P>
   And Western governments and aid donors say violence on farms
must end before they will provide promised financing. That makes
some people seethe. ``When all is said and done, who are they to
decide that historical injustices should play second fiddle to the
problems on the farms?'' said Sam Moyo, a highly regarded land
expert who is helping Zimbabwe's government negotiate with the
white farmers union.
</P>
<P>
   There are other points of dissonance, too. While Western
officials were cheering the opposition alliance of black union
members, white farmers and white industrialists that swept into
Parliament in June, some South Africans felt a nagging sense of
unease.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Tsvangirai, the leader of Zimbabwe's new opposition
party, the Movement for Democratic Change, said South African
officials were so suspicious of his group that they asked whether
he had links to the rebel movements in Angola and Mozambique, which
were financed and supported by the white apartheid government
through the early 1990s, in an effort to destabilize the black
governments in those countries. ``They were asking whether I have
relations with Unita or Renamo and I told them no,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tsvangirai says he will oppose Mugabe for the presidency if he
runs again in 2002. No matter what, he says, the man who led
Zimbabwe for 20 years will go down in history as having destroyed
his country.
</P>
<P>
   But even some Western officials disagree. They say if Mugabe
succeeds in returning a significant chunk of land to the black
majority, he will be viewed with some respect on the continent.
</P>
<P>
   ``His legacy is not about stabilizing the economy or attracting
foreign donors,'' said a white Western official, who has worked on
economic issues in and around Africa for several years. ``It's the
reason why he sat in a jail for so many years; it's the land,'' he
said. ``And when the dust settles, he will get some sympathy in
Africa. People may disagree about his tactics, but they'll say,
`This guy really did it.'''

majority, he will be viewed with some respect on the continent.
</P>
<P>
   ``His legacy is not about stabilizing the economy or attracting
foreign donors,'' said a white Western official, who has worked on
economic issues in and around Africa for several years. ``It's the
reason why he sat in a jail for so many years; it's the land,'' he
said. ``And when the dust settles, he will get some sympathy in
Africa. People may disagree about his tactics, but they'll say,
`This guy really did it.'''

   In India, a Reality Drama for Real &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The line between fantasy and reality is perhaps never as pliable
as in the minds of people who love the movie screen, or so it
seemed in India last week. There, a real-life mustachioed villain
seized a fantasy-life hero and kept millions of people and their
officials in suspense about what might happen next.
</P>
<P>
   The villain of the piece is Veerappan, said by the authorities
to be an aging smuggler and elephant poacher who killed his
daughter and dozens of policemen. He has nevertheless played Robin
Hood to forest dwellers in southern India as he has eluded years of
efforts by the authorities to arrest him. But now he wants to be
allowed to live a normal life, and stop hiding.
</P>
<P>
   So last week, police say, he kidnapped and hid in the jungle one
of India's most revered movie idols _ 72-year-old Rajkumar, who
millions of Indians have seen on the screen as a Hindu god or a
king or a hero in some other garb. The star has made more than 200
films in all.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, the plan is for the real criminal to ransom the
fantasy hero for some sort of a pardon.
</P>
<P>
   The public's reaction was equal to the staggering audacity of
the crime. On Monday and Tuesday in Bangalore, a city otherwise
known mostly for its booming information technology industry, bands
of movie fans erupted in street protests bordering on violence and
brought the city nearly to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   And one novelist, U.R. Ananthumurthy, drew the appropriate
lesson. Bangalore, he said, ``belongs to the modern world system
and thinks it can ignore mass psychology. But it forgets that other
reality that lurks within.''
</P>
<P>
   Drop That Doubloon &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you drop a dollar bill on the sidewalk and do not pick it up
quickly, it is safe to say you have lost your rights to it. If your
sailing ship drops into the sea, though, is it still yours?
</P>
<P>
   Until now, probably not. But the idea of finding and salvaging
lost treasure just got a nasty legal jolt.
</P>
<P>
   In its years of conquering parts of the world, Spain left many a
ship on the ocean floor, often laden with riches, and these
provided juicy targets for adventurers. But with technology making
salvaging easier these days, Spain and other countries want to
reclaim these scraps of heritage _ and loot. And a federal appeals
court in Virginia has now ruled that two ships sunk off that
state's coast still, centuries later, belong to Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Treasure hunters are not happy, and the one who found those two
ships is weighing an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But if the ruling stands, it could mean, say, that the British
could lay claim to the superstar of wrecks, the Titanic. On the
other hand, it could also raise trickier issues. After all, much of
that Spanish loot was first stolen from Latin American natives. Who
has the prior claim now?

   After Camp David, Thin Ice for Barak

   Israel's fractious parliament gave a little breathing room and a

efforts to reach a compromise on Jerusalem with Yasser Arafat and
nail down the terms of a final peace accord this summer.
</P>
<P>
   In one vote on Monday, July 31, Barak's government survived a
no-confidence motion mounted by opponents of the peace effort. But
in a second vote that day, Barak's candidate for the largely
ceremonial Israeli presidency, Shimon Peres, was defeated in favor

security measures put in place after the arrest of Dr. Wen Ho Lee,

targets only by cutting back on burning coal and oil, which emit
heat-trapping carbon dioxide. It must get credit for the country's

   Canada, Russia and other countries with lots of green acres are
echoing the position. But Europe, largely shorn of forests, says
that's cheating, and some environmental groups, eager for more
solar panels and fewer power plants, agree.

school science curriculum, paving the way for that decision to be

   In a Republican primary on Tuesday, voters defeated three

EVERYONE ASKS FOR ARAB UNITY. GETTING IT IS HARDER. 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)  
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ Political slogans tend to long outlive their
authors in this part of the world and none is more enduring, or
more musty with age, than the 1950s-vintage catch phrase ``Arab
unity.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten years have passed since all 22 leaders of Arab League
countries last gathered for a summit meeting, which was held here,
in the aftermath of Iraq's surprise invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2,
1990. It was not a pretty sight, marred by food fights between
angry Kuwaiti sheiks and bellicose Iraqi officials, and by
recriminations and vacillation all around.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at the urging of the Palestinians, a few Arab leaders like
Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak and Jordan's King Abdullah have
renewed the perennial call for a new summit meeting, this time
billed as an emergency meeting for Arabs to regroup after the
failure at Camp David and to counter the spin from Washington that
the breakdown was due solely to Arab recalcitrance. Chances for a
summit meeting and a new Arab consensus are slim, Arab officials
now say. Still, the chimera of a united Arab front continues to
shimmer on the horizon _ and, suddenly, not just for the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has long found the Arabs' fractiousness useful
in promoting bilateral peace talks and maintaining sanctions on
Iraq. But now Edward Walker, the U.S. assistant secretary of state,
has been sent on a tour of Arab states that maintain relations with
the United States; he is asking leaders to persuade Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat to accept Israeli and U.S. proposals for a
final peace.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of those proposals is an offer of shared
administration of Arab East Jerusalem, but not of sovereignty over
it. So far, the public reaction to Walker's trip has been
resentment that the United States seems to be calling in its chits
in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   ``True, the Arab state of affairs is sufficiently dismal to
foreclose a decisive pan-Arab stand on Jerusalem and the need to
restore Arab sovereignty over its eastern sector,'' wrote Joseph
Samaha, a Lebanese analyst for the international Arabic daily
newspaper Al Hayat. ``But it's not that bad that the Arabs will
concede the loss of the city to Israel forever.''
</P>
<P>
   If a less fragmented Arab leadership would be helpful to
Washington and Israel for the first time in a decade _ and helpful
to Arabs who are nostalgic for the days when, collectively, they
counted for more _ it is also much harder to nail down now.
</P>
<P>
   First, the internal political and economic situation in the Arab
world is more fragile than it was a decade ago, when Washington
could stitch together an anti-Iraq alliance that included most Arab
nations and then proceed to establish its own primacy in the
region, where many countries are beggars for money and arms.
</P>
<P>
   Long-serving military figures who once could simply impose their
will on their people, like King Hussein of Jordan and Hafez Assad
of Syria, are gone. The nations they left behind for their sons and
successors suffer under sick economies with raging unemployment.
Moreover, their heirs are still consolidating power, making them
more sensitive to hints of internal discontent and to the threat,
real or not, of minority extremists who criticize anything that
seems to be catering to Israel or the West.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the new cast of characters in Arab politics is
theoretically more free of the constraints of history than the old.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein and Assad, along with the assassinated Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, were warriors of the Arab-Israeli
conflict. Rabin carried an aura of victory, as the former commander
in the 1967 war, in which Jordan and Syria lost big chunks of
territory to Israel. But their 1967 defeats, and their failure to
regain either the West Bank or the Golan Heights through war or
diplomacy, weighed heavily on the shoulders of the two Arab
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The history of the Syrian and Jordanian leaders also contributed
mightily to the lack of Arab unity. No friends of each other, both
also had hostile relations with Arafat, as did the late King Hassan
of Morocco, another leader who has bequeathed a regime to his son.
</P>
<P>
   While their absence from the scene could be considered helpful
to peacemaking and Arab unity, the legacy they left of failing
economies and ideologically rigid governments may sabotage those
goals for their heirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The baggage of history on their sons is just as great,'' said
Kamel Abu Jaber, a former Jordanian foreign minister who is now
president of the Jordanian Institute for Diplomacy. ``That's the
historical danger of Camp David. It may revive in these young
leaders, who may be willing to compromise, a tendency to refreeze
into rigid attitudes.''
</P>
<P>
   More than ever, the Arab world is also running at different
speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Islamic fundamentalist movements, while brutally suppressed in
places like Egypt and Syria, are still alive and well elsewhere.
The ruling family of Saudi Arabia feels under constant threat from
extremists inside and outside the country who criticize it for the
continued presence of American troops on its soil. Fundamentalist
groups opposed to the Saudi policy of cool cooperation with the
West send out streams of e-mails each day accusing the royals of
corruption and decadence.
</P>
<P>
   In Kuwait, a new alliance of Islamists and nationalists has
warned the government against making contacts with Israel or
Israelis. So while people in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and Egypt may
yearn for the presumed economic benefits of a comprehensive peace,
the domestic message to the rulers in the Gulf is far different.
``Nobody here cares about the supposed economic benefits,'' said
Ahmed Baghdadi, a professor of political science at Kuwait
University. ``In contrast, the religious movement in the National
Assembly is very strong.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BC-MIDEAST-ARABS-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; CAIRO: very strong.'' &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So the Old City, a tiny island that contains sites holy to
Islam, Christianity and Judaism, may be the one topic that can
unite the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The place where Jesus Christ was resurrected, where Omar built
his mosque, where the Prophet Mohammed ascended to heaven _ that's
not big stuff?'' commented Abdel Moneim Said, director of the Al
Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies. ``It's in the
Koran. It's in the prayers.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of Arab analysts warn that those concerned with the
Middle East should be careful of what they wish for. Unity in the
Middle East has historically been reactive: a collective ``no.''
The Arab League was created in 1949 to organize opposition to the
state of Israel. The Organization of the Islamic Conference, a
broader group, was created in 1969 to focus Muslim anger at an
attempt by a Christian extremist in Jerusalem to burn down Al Aksa
mosque.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, if a final peace settlement is the goal, the region
may be better served by disunity, with each nation following its
own interests and path.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a final settlement, then here in Jordan at least
we hopefully can start talking about a country that is concerned
about something other than the Palestinian question,'' said Adnan
Abu Odeh, a former adviser to Jordan's King Hussein. ``These days,
unfortunately, the region is clouded with illusions.''

EVERYONE ASKS FOR ARAB UNITY. GETTING IT IS HARDER. 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)  
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ Political slogans tend to long outlive their
authors in this part of the world and none is more enduring, or
more musty with age, than the 1950s-vintage catch phrase ``Arab
unity.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten years have passed since all 22 leaders of Arab League
countries last gathered for a summit meeting, which was held here,
in the aftermath of Iraq's surprise invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2,
1990. It was not a pretty sight, marred by food fights between
angry Kuwaiti sheiks and bellicose Iraqi officials, and by
recriminations and vacillation all around.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at the urging of the Palestinians, a few Arab leaders like
Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak and Jordan's King Abdullah have
renewed the perennial call for a new summit meeting, this time
billed as an emergency meeting for Arabs to regroup after the
failure at Camp David and to counter the spin from Washington that
the breakdown was due solely to Arab recalcitrance. Chances for a
summit meeting and a new Arab consensus are slim, Arab officials
now say. Still, the chimera of a united Arab front continues to
shimmer on the horizon _ and, suddenly, not just for the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has long found the Arabs' fractiousness useful
in promoting bilateral peace talks and maintaining sanctions on
Iraq. But now Edward Walker, the U.S. assistant secretary of state,
has been sent on a tour of Arab states that maintain relations with
the United States; he is asking leaders to persuade Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat to accept Israeli and U.S. proposals for a
final peace.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of those proposals is an offer of shared
administration of Arab East Jerusalem, but not of sovereignty over
it. So far, the public reaction to Walker's trip has been
resentment that the United States seems to be calling in its chits
in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   ``True, the Arab state of affairs is sufficiently dismal to
foreclose a decisive pan-Arab stand on Jerusalem and the need to
restore Arab sovereignty over its eastern sector,'' wrote Joseph
Samaha, a Lebanese analyst for the international Arabic daily
newspaper Al Hayat. ``But it's not that bad that the Arabs will
concede the loss of the city to Israel forever.''
</P>
<P>
   If a less fragmented Arab leadership would be helpful to
Washington and Israel for the first time in a decade _ and helpful
to Arabs who are nostalgic for the days when, collectively, they
counted for more _ it is also much harder to nail down now.
</P>
<P>
   First, the internal political and economic situation in the Arab
world is more fragile than it was a decade ago, when Washington
could stitch together an anti-Iraq alliance that included most Arab
nations and then proceed to establish its own primacy in the
region, where many countries are beggars for money and arms.
</P>
<P>
   Long-serving military figures who once could simply impose their
will on their people, like King Hussein of Jordan and Hafez Assad
of Syria, are gone. The nations they left behind for their sons and
successors suffer under sick economies with raging unemployment.
Moreover, their heirs are still consolidating power, making them
more sensitive to hints of internal discontent and to the threat,
real or not, of minority extremists who criticize anything that
seems to be catering to Israel or the West.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the new cast of characters in Arab politics is
theoretically more free of the constraints of history than the old.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein and Assad, along with the assassinated Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, were warriors of the Arab-Israeli
conflict. Rabin carried an aura of victory, as the former commander
in the 1967 war, in which Jordan and Syria lost big chunks of
territory to Israel. But their 1967 defeats, and their failure to
regain either the West Bank or the Golan Heights through war or
diplomacy, weighed heavily on the shoulders of the two Arab
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The history of the Syrian and Jordanian leaders also contributed
mightily to the lack of Arab unity. No friends of each other, both
also had hostile relations with Arafat, as did the late King Hassan
of Morocco, another leader who has bequeathed a regime to his son.
</P>
<P>
   While their absence from the scene could be considered helpful
to peacemaking and Arab unity, the legacy they left of failing
economies and ideologically rigid governments may sabotage those
goals for their heirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The baggage of history on their sons is just as great,'' said
Kamel Abu Jaber, a former Jordanian foreign minister who is now
president of the Jordanian Institute for Diplomacy. ``That's the
historical danger of Camp David. It may revive in these young
leaders, who may be willing to compromise, a tendency to refreeze
into rigid attitudes.''
</P>
<P>
   More than ever, the Arab world is also running at different
speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Islamic fundamentalist movements, while brutally suppressed in
places like Egypt and Syria, are still alive and well elsewhere.

PUMPING THE BIG TENT: THE ROCK DOESN'T KISS BABIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)  
(Eds: Words in boldface should be set in italics.)

<P>
   By the evidence of flying headbutts, figure-four leglocks and
The People's Elbow, you might not see The Rock as a GOP kind of
guy. He is usually in black underwear, talking trash, wiggling
eyebrows as expressive as John Belushi's, in his role as the World
Wrestling Federation's hunkiest heel and its reigning champion.
</P>
<P>
   But there he was last week, not at a Wrestlemania or a
Smackdown, but at the Republican National Convention, which shared
two things with the WWF: The event was scripted and the outcome was
never in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The Rock was ``in the house,'' as he likes to say, to deliver
unto the conventioneers a voter registration message and to
introduce House Speaker Dennis Hastert, a former wrestling coach,
strictly an amateur.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you smell what The Rock is cooking?'' he asked, a
trademark question (translation: ``If you know what I mean''),
which he first uttered at Wrestlemania XIV in 1998, sitting next to
Gennifer Flowers, who was interviewing him.
</P>
<P>
   See, The Rock  &UR; is &LR;  political. And politic. He  &UR; never &LR;  labeled
the convention crowd at First Union Center in Philadelphia a
``bunch of jabronis'' (that is to say, nobodies).
</P>
<P>
   ``Fourteen million eligible voters watch The Rock every single
week,'' he said with an oratorial fervor calculated to inspire
young Republicans and voters everywhere to perform their civic
duty. But were they watching? Do the GOP's demos mix with the WWF's
young male viewers? Only if they were hoping to see a steel-cage
death match pitting the tag team of George W. and Poppy Bush
against John McCain and Jesse ``The Governor'' Ventura, who
wrestled when The Rock was a mere pebble.
</P>
<P>
   Just who is The Rock?
</P>
<P>
   His real name is Dwayne Johnson, a 28-year-old, third-generation
wrestler, who is half Samoan and half African-American.
</P>
<P>
   The Rock, a thoroughly rotten character, is short for his former
nom de mat, Rocky Maivia, a nice guy who finished last _ like
Michael Dukakis. He speaks of himself almost entirely in the first
person. As in, ``The Rock says . . .''
</P>
<P>
   His autobiography, ``The Rock Says . . .'' (Regan Books), was on
the New York Times best-seller list for 20 weeks, falling six weeks
short of ``Have a Nice Day!'' by another another wrestler, Mick
Foley (a k a Mankind and Cactus Jack).
</P>
<P>
   In his 283-page memoir, he writes about why The Rock is The
Rock.
</P>
<P>
   His irresistible personality: ``The Rock is charismatic, funny,
smart . . . and completely over the top in terms of ego and
arrogance.''
</P>
<P>
   His modest ego: ``With his sculpted physique, honey-brown
complexion, razor-trimmed sideburns and piercing gaze, The Rock
looks like a million bucks _ which is appropriate since that's
almost exactly what The People's Champion will earn for his
evening's labor.''
</P>
<P>
   His serendipitous character development: ``The quirks and
peculiarities evolved organically. I never said, `Hmmm, I need a
gimmick. I need an angle, I need . . . I need . . .  &UR; I need an
eyebrow &LR; ! And then _ I know! _ I'll take the most basic maneuver in
wrestling and turn it into the most electrifying move in wrestling,
and I'll call it  &UR; The People's Elbow &LR; ! Yeah, that's the plan!'''
</P>
<P>
   His ingenious mission statement: ``It's funny, I always like to
say now that The Rock is the kind of guy who won't kiss a baby and
he'll  &UR; throw &LR;  an old lady across the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, get out and vote! &QL;

THE DONORS RULE, BUT IN NAME ONLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)  
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ It began with Team 100, a name for a political
club that was purposefully subtle and maybe even a bit coy. One had
to imagine what the 100 stood for: Senators? Dollars? Nickels?
</P>
<P>
   Hardly. Team 100 was made up of the $100,000 contributors, the
pinnacle of political generosity back in 1988 when the elder George
Bush invented the Republicans' first elite donor club for a handful
of the party's most generous patrons.
</P>
<P>
   But in presidential politics, donation inflation is at least 50
percent, and last week the Republican convention was overrun by a
stampede of 600 Team 100 members. Their suite at the Ritz-Carlton
was jammed. Those who complained were offered an option: Take out
those checkbooks and give the party $250,000, the entry fee to the
Republican Regents, the party's newest and most exclusive donor
club, whose suite at the Four Seasons had plenty of leg room.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Regents were given receptions with both the elder
and younger George Bushes, a Saks Fifth Avenue fashion show and a
party at Tiffany &AMP; Co. ``There's something to do every minute,''
said Sam Fox, the top-giving Regent (nearly $600,000), who sounded
worn out by the yacht rides and golf tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   The word regent is defined as one who governs a kingdom in the
minority, absence or disability of the sovereign ruler. In this era
of outrage over campaign finance excesses, it seems odd that the
Republicans would choose a name that allows Americans to imagine a
seat next to the throne for the party's $250,000-and-up sponsors _
a list that includes Phillip Morris Cos., the National Rifle
Association, AT&AMP;T and Enron Corp., the Houston energy and
commodities conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   The donor group was named by Mel Sembler, the Republican's
gregarious finance chairman, who made a royal fortune building
shopping centers. ``I just thought it had a nice ring to it,'' he
said earlier this year. But a few fund-raisers have quietly
complained that the name opens the party to criticism that it
caters to a blue-blood elite.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats were far more careful, calling their top donor
club Leadership 2000 (for people who give or raise $350,000; there
are 18 members). Other Republican club names also sound benign: the
Eagles, the Majority Council.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Regents is a runaway success. Sembler's goal was to sign
up 100 members by Nov. 7, but there are already 139. Two-thirds are
individuals who say they give not because they want something in
return but because they believe in what the party stands for _ less
government and lower taxes.
</P>
<P>
   What's next for the Republicans? A $500,000 club? A $1 million
club? Perhaps, a few fund-raisers acknowledged last week. But they
quickly promised that the name would give nothing away. &QL;

ELECTRICITY: GET IT WHILE IT LASTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (The Week in Review)  
 By ALEX BERENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For as long as anyone can remember, reliable, cheap electricity
has been taken for granted in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore, at least not in California.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, the nation's most populous state _ and the
world's seventh-largest economy _ decided to deregulate its
electric industry. New power generators would compete for retail
customers with established utilities, and businesses and consumers
could choose their power suppliers. The competition would lower
everyone's prices.
</P>
<P>
   At least that was the theory. Things have not worked out so well
in practice. This summer, power bills have doubled in San Diego,
rolling blackouts have hit San Francisco, and the state has
repeatedly cut off some big customers to protect the rest of its
power grid. The power supply is near collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have in San Diego is an unnatural disaster, a man-made
storm unleashed by the state and federal governments,'' said
Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers Action
Network, a 42,000-member group in San Diego. ``We're hearing
panicked calls from customers saying `I can pay my electric bill,
or I can pay my rent in full.'''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everyone agrees that deregulation shoulders a significant
amount of blame for the crisis. The reason is that with
deregulation looming in the mid-1990s, the state's utilities were
afraid to build new plants, while independent power producers only
began planning plant construction two years ago, when the state's
voters confirmed their support for deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with demand rising unexpectedly fast, the state is
critically short of power. And for at least the next two years, the
soonest any significant capacity can be added, there is no easy
solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The squeaking gets tighter in 2001,'' said Daniel Nix, deputy
director for energy information at the California Energy
Commission, a state agency that licenses new power plants and
predicts energy demand. If next summer is even slightly hotter than
normal, ``there is a good chance we would have inadequate
resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Blaming deregulation for the current crisis, however, leaves the
more important longterm questions unanswered. Can deregulation
solve the problems it has created, or should it be repealed? And
does California's experience presage other crises as deregulation
moves forward nationwide?
</P>
<P>
   Independent power producers and electricity traders, whose
future depends on deregulation, argue that California is an
anomaly. They say it faces an exceptionally tight power supply
situation as a result of fast economic growth throughout the West
and the state's traditional reluctance to build new plants.
Moreover, they say, power companies are moving quickly to build
plants throughout California and in neighboring states, and the
crisis will subside within a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   ``A deregulated world is the right market for electricity,''
said Ron Walter, senior vice president at Calpine, an independent
power producer in San Jose that is building three plants.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the state's energy commission has been asked to
approve the construction of 14 power plants. Combined with four
already under construction, that would add more than 11,000
megawatts of power, 20 percent of the state's total peak demand.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the response has been similar, said Jeffrey K.
Skilling, president of Enron, the Houston company that is the
world's leading trader of electricity and natural gas. Enron
reports that power companies have announced plans to build nearly
240,000 megawatts in new North American capacity, increasing supply
by more than one-quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within two or three years, the problem will be fixed,''
Skilling said. ``Let the market do its thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But regulators and some other utilities are less sanguine.
Electricity is a unique commodity, they say. First, power
consumption varies widely, with summer peak demand 20 percent or
more higher than average. So meeting peak loads requires the heavy
expense of building many ``peakers,'' plants that run only a few
hours each year, when demand is highest.
</P>
<P>
   Second, there is no substitute for electricity. It undergirds
modern life, and while demand can be marginally reduced by briefly
closing factories, turning off air conditioning and elevators in
office buildings, even those slight reductions cause significant
disruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``When oranges go up, when they double or triple or quadruple, I
eat apples,'' said Loretta Lynch, president of the California
Public Utilities Commission. ``when electricity goes up, I can't
avoid using it.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, electricity is also ``supply inelastic.'' When all the
plants in a region are running at full steam, there is simply no
way to get more power.
</P>
<P>
   Those factors mean that as power demand approaches peak supply
in a deregulated market, generators can charge 10 or 100 times the
normal price for electricity and know that they will find takers.
With the possibility of windfall profits every time there is a hot
summer, the power producers have little incentive to build enough
plants to have a large reserve.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, said Dr. Eric Hirst, an industry consultant who
supports deregulation, smaller reserves would result in lower
prices, because unnecessary plants would not be built. Meanwhile,
overall reliability for most customers will not be affected,
because companies like Enron will seek out customers willing to cut
demand for the few hours a year when supply is inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, ``big brother spread the cost of extra capacity
among all customers,'' Hirst said. ``We paid for that.''
</P>
<P>
   That explanation does not carry much water in California these
days, said state Sen. Steve Peace of San Diego, who helped write
California's deregulation legislation but is now calling for some
controls on prices. It ignores the huge price spikes that come if
demand runs too close to supply, the power to set prices held by a
small number of generators, and the importance of a reliable supply
of electricity for everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   And Peace notes that, while power companies and economists talk
of competition leading to lower bills, consumers want the stable
prices and reliability they have had for 50 years under regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole market on a national level suffers from an excess
of philosophical engagement and a deficiency of practical
management,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market can either prove that it's disciplined enough and
stable enough to address its problem. Or inevitably, whether it's
the right thing to do or the wrong thing to do, the political
system will cut them off at the pass.''`

THE DONORS RULE, BUT IN NAME ONLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)  
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ It began with Team 100, a name for a political
club that was purposefully subtle and maybe even a bit coy. One had
to imagine what the 100 stood for: Senators? Dollars? Nickels?
</P>
<P>
   Hardly. Team 100 was made up of the $100,000 contributors, the
pinnacle of political generosity back in 1988 when the elder George
Bush invented the Republicans' first elite donor club for a handful
of the party's most generous patrons.
</P>
<P>
   But in presidential politics, donation inflation is at least 50
percent, and last week the Republican convention was overrun by a
stampede of 600 Team 100 members. Their suite at the Ritz-Carlton
was jammed. Those who complained were offered an option: Take out
those checkbooks and give the party $250,000, the entry fee to the
Republican Regents, the party's newest and most exclusive donor
club, whose suite at the Four Seasons had plenty of leg room.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Regents were given receptions with both the elder
and younger George Bushes, a Saks Fifth Avenue fashion show and a
party at Tiffany &AMP; Co. ``There's something to do every minute,''
said Sam Fox, the top-giving Regent (nearly $600,000), who sounded
worn out by the yacht rides and golf tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   The word regent is defined as one who governs a kingdom in the
minority, absence or disability of the sovereign ruler. In this era
of outrage over campaign finance excesses, it seems odd that the
Republicans would choose a name that allows Americans to imagine a
seat next to the throne for the party's $250,000-and-up sponsors _
a list that includes Phillip Morris Cos., the National Rifle
Association, AT&AMP;T and Enron Corp., the Houston energy and
commodities conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   The donor group was named by Mel Sembler, the Republican's
gregarious finance chairman, who made a royal fortune building
shopping centers. ``I just thought it had a nice ring to it,'' he
said earlier this year. But a few fund-raisers have quietly
complained that the name opens the party to criticism that it
caters to a blue-blood elite.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats were far more careful, calling their top donor
club Leadership 2000 (for people who give or raise $350,000; there
are 18 members). Other Republican club names also sound benign: the
Eagles, the Majority Council.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Regents is a runaway success. Sembler's goal was to sign
up 100 members by Nov. 7, but there are already 139. Two-thirds are
individuals who say they give not because they want something in
return but because they believe in what the party stands for _ less
government and lower taxes.
</P>
<P>
   What's next for the Republicans? A $500,000 club? A $1 million
club? Perhaps, a few fund-raisers acknowledged last week. But they
quickly promised that the name would give nothing away. &QL;

ELECTRICITY: GET IT WHILE IT LASTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (The Week in Review)  
 By ALEX BERENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For as long as anyone can remember, reliable, cheap electricity
has been taken for granted in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore, at least not in California.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, the nation's most populous state _ and the
world's seventh-largest economy _ decided to deregulate its
electric industry. New power generators would compete for retail
customers with established utilities, and businesses and consumers
could choose their power suppliers. The competition would lower
everyone's prices.
</P>
<P>
   At least that was the theory. Things have not worked out so well
in practice. This summer, power bills have doubled in San Diego,
rolling blackouts have hit San Francisco, and the state has
repeatedly cut off some big customers to protect the rest of its
power grid. The power supply is near collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have in San Diego is an unnatural disaster, a man-made
storm unleashed by the state and federal governments,'' said
Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers Action
Network, a 42,000-member group in San Diego. ``We're hearing
panicked calls from customers saying `I can pay my electric bill,
or I can pay my rent in full.'''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everyone agrees that deregulation shoulders a significant
amount of blame for the crisis. The reason is that with
deregulation looming in the mid-1990s, the state's utilities were
afraid to build new plants, while independent power producers only
began planning plant construction two years ago, when the state's
voters confirmed their support for deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with demand rising unexpectedly fast, the state is
critically short of power. And for at least the next two years, the
soonest any significant capacity can be added, there is no easy
solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The squeaking gets tighter in 2001,'' said Daniel Nix, deputy
director for energy information at the California Energy
Commission, a state agency that licenses new power plants and
predicts energy demand. If next summer is even slightly hotter than
normal, ``there is a good chance we would have inadequate
resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Blaming deregulation for the current crisis, however, leaves the
more important longterm questions unanswered. Can deregulation
solve the problems it has created, or should it be repealed? And
does California's experience presage other crises as deregulation
moves forward nationwide?
</P>
<P>
   Independent power producers and electricity traders, whose
future depends on deregulation, argue that California is an
anomaly. They say it faces an exceptionally tight power supply
situation as a result of fast economic growth throughout the West
and the state's traditional reluctance to build new plants.
Moreover, they say, power companies are moving quickly to build
plants throughout California and in neighboring states, and the
crisis will subside within a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   ``A deregulated world is the right market for electricity,''
said Ron Walter, senior vice president at Calpine, an independent
power producer in San Jose that is building three plants.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the state's energy commission has been asked to
approve the construction of 14 power plants. Combined with four
already under construction, that would add more than 11,000
megawatts of power, 20 percent of the state's total peak demand.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the response has been similar, said Jeffrey K.
Skilling, president of Enron, the Houston company that is the
world's leading trader of electricity and natural gas. Enron
reports that power companies have announced plans to build nearly
240,000 megawatts in new North American capacity, increasing supply
by more than one-quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within two or three years, the problem will be fixed,''

   One of the enduring mysteries of the school shootings in places
like Littleton, Colo., and West Paducah, Ky., is how so many people
could have known so much but done so little to prevent bloodshed.
The Columbine High School massacre, in which 15 people were killed,
took place in April 1999. This May a 13-year-old boy fatally shot a
teacher in Lake Worth, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   In case after case, the friends and acquaintances of the killers
had heard boasts, muttered plans for mayhem or seen such warning
signs as a fascination with guns that may have seemed dissonant
even in communities of sportsmen and firearms. But they did nothing
to stop the crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The recently released testimony of teen-agers who knew one such
killer provide some explanation. At 14, Michael Carneal killed
three girls and injured five other students when he opened fire on
a prayer group at Heath High School in West Paducah, Ky., on Dec.
1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The following excerpts are from depositions of the teen-agers
that were filed in a civil damage suit in McCracken County Circuit
Court in Paducah. The questioner, in most instances, is Mike Breen,
a lawyer for the parents of the three murdered girls, Nicole
Hadley, Kayce Steger and Jessica James. The parents sued more than
50 people, including many of the teen-agers who knew Carneal,
claiming that they could have prevented the killings or, in some
cases, that they had helped plan them. The judge, William L.
Shadoan, dismissed the suits, ruling that only the killer could be
held liable for his crime. Carneal, now 17, is serving a life
sentence after pleading guilty, saying he was mentally ill at the
time of the shooting.
</P>

the killings, describing Carneal, a friend from the school band:
(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   He was just this goofy kid that just did really silly stuff. And
I liked that, because I'm a silly guy myself. . . . He told me,
once or twice, that he thought it would be cool to walk _ or run _
down the halls shooting people. And he told me once he thought that
it would be cool to go to prison. . . . He told me that he would,
like, get keys to people's houses, and, like, just go up and unlock
the door and, like, steal medication and stuff, and money from
people's houses. . . . You, like, look back and you see all these
little things that he did that were like, sort of like warning
signs, sort of, but you didn't really realize them at the time. . .
. At the time, I thought I knew him, you know. But then, like,
after all this, I really didn't know him at all, because . . .
like, this silly person was just a cover-up of this other guy.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Matthew R. Neamon, 9th grader, Carneal's
friend since second grade. (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   He brought a gun to school, and he showed it to me . . . the
November before. . . . He had it in his backpack. . . . It was a
pistol . . . semiautomatic. . . . He was like, ``Do you want to see
something?'' And I was like, sure. And he showed it to me. And,
`Ooh, a gun' . . . There was a rumor on other days that he had one.
. . . Just ``Michael has a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was it against rules at school to have guns there?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you tell anybody about it?
</P>
<P>
   A: No.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why not?
</P>
<P>
   A: Like I said, because I didn't want to get my friend in
trouble.

Michael's girlfriend the fall before the shootings. (END ITALICS

</P>
<P>
   ((He was)) usually quiet, but then sometimes he would get noisy
and annoying. . . . More when we were in high school, probably to
fit in. . . . He got picked on a lot because he was small and _ I
don't know _ he didn't play football, or anything. But a lot of
freshmen got picked on. . . . He wasn't a big part of the jock
population. . . . He just wasn't real tough and big. He was small.
. . .. He was stranger than we are, more strange.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you ever hear Michael talk about taking over the school?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yeah. Not as in seriously. A lot of kids talk about taking
over the school . . . No one likes school, so. . . . Every school
I've been to, someone would mention we should burn down the school.
It's not strange for someone to not like school. . . . It was
around Halloween, he brought a gun to school that he was trying to
sell.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you know what kind of gun it was?
</P>
<P>
   A: A revolver? It's silver and the kind that has the spinny
thing that comes out. . . . For some reason, it didn't strike me as
odd.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Really?
</P>
<P>
   A: I just thought, well, he's trying to sell a gun. . . . I
didn't really _ I didn't think, ``Oh, goodness, he's going to kill
someone at school,'' because that just never had happened.

<P>
   Q: He was ((at your house)) the Saturday before the shootings?

<P>
   A: Yes. . . . I talked to Michael Carneal. . . . His sister had
told me that he was doing stuff with credit cards, buying stuff off
the Internet with credit card numbers that were not his. And I
warned him about getting in trouble and getting caught. And I told
him that if he got caught, he had to shower in front of a bunch of
guys, and probably wouldn't like that. That's about all I can
remember of the discussion.

</P>
<P>
   A: There was a handgun and some rifles. They were . . . on the
floor, like, on a blanket type thing ((in my brother's bedroom)). .

And it says . . . ``Michael Carneal said we should go into ((the
school administration)) office and shoot them while in their
offices. Barnett responded `Yeah, yeah,' but didn't think anything
about it.'' . . . What was your reaction to that statement, when
Carneal made it to you?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not much of one. It's just idle conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You considered a statement that Michael Carneal wanted to go
in and shoot school personnel an idle statement?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sure. I mean, I'm sure people, all over the place, say random
things like that, you know, not meaning anything by them. You know,
like, ``I really hate this,'' you know. And they don't mean
anything by it. And people don't take them seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And so, people, according to you, don't take threats to
murder like this seriously?
</P>
<P>
   A: It wasn't a threat to murder, though. . . . It was probably
just us hanging around at school, at lunch.

of Carneal. (END ITALICS HERE)

<P>
   ((On the morning of the shootings)) I arrived at school
approximately 7:35 a.m. . . . Usually, I was there a little bit
later. But I did get there to see what Michael was going to do. . .
. Because he told us, on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, that he
was going to do something. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q: And you took him seriously enough, at least to the extent
that you thought he was going to do something that was going to be
worth watching, right?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And you showed up to school early that day so you could see?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: All right. And during the time that you were thinking about
this, between the Wednesday that he made the statement and the
Monday morning that he actually did it, did you contact anybody
about it and tell them?
</P>
<P>
   A: No.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why not?
</P>
<P>
   A: I was expecting a practical joke of some sort. . . . Perhaps
fireworks, water balloons, something of that nature.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Toby Nace, a ninth grader, was once one of
Michael's best friends, although they had drifted apart. (END

</P>
<P>
   After we watched a movie, ``Basketball Diaries'' ((which
includes a fantasy of a violent school shooting)), he said that
would be neat to go in the school and shoot people that you don't
like. . . . And he said, if you're going to take over the school,
you could use those axes. . . . I just went along with him. I said,
``Yeah, if you're going to take over the school, you would have to
cut the phone lines,'' or something. . . . He just did stuff to get
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ((The morning of the murders)) I seen him put ear plugs in, and
((I)) say, ``Hey, it would be funny if you wore those during class
while the teacher is giving a speech.'' And he laughed. And then I
just turned around. And then, when I turned back, he was pulling a
gun out of his backpack.

   One of the enduring mysteries of the school shootings in places
like Littleton, Colo., and West Paducah, Ky., is how so many people
could have known so much but done so little to prevent bloodshed.
The Columbine High School massacre, in which 15 people were killed,
took place in April 1999. This May a 13-year-old boy fatally shot a
teacher in Lake Worth, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   In case after case, the friends and acquaintances of the killers
had heard boasts, muttered plans for mayhem or seen such warning
signs as a fascination with guns that may have seemed dissonant
even in communities of sportsmen and firearms. But they did nothing
to stop the crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The recently released testimony of teen-agers who knew one such
killer provide some explanation. At 14, Michael Carneal killed
three girls and injured five other students when he opened fire on
a prayer group at Heath High School in West Paducah, Ky., on Dec.
1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The following excerpts are from depositions of the teen-agers
that were filed in a civil damage suit in McCracken County Circuit
Court in Paducah. The questioner, in most instances, is Mike Breen,
a lawyer for the parents of the three murdered girls, Nicole
Hadley, Kayce Steger and Jessica James. The parents sued more than
50 people, including many of the teen-agers who knew Carneal,
claiming that they could have prevented the killings or, in some
cases, that they had helped plan them. The judge, William L.
Shadoan, dismissed the suits, ruling that only the killer could be
held liable for his crime. Carneal, now 17, is serving a life
sentence after pleading guilty, saying he was mentally ill at the
time of the shooting.

(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   He was just this goofy kid that just did really silly stuff. And
I liked that, because I'm a silly guy myself. . . . He told me,
once or twice, that he thought it would be cool to walk _ or run _
down the halls shooting people. And he told me once he thought that
it would be cool to go to prison. . . . He told me that he would,
like, get keys to people's houses, and, like, just go up and unlock
the door and, like, steal medication and stuff, and money from
people's houses. . . . You, like, look back and you see all these
little things that he did that were like, sort of like warning
signs, sort of, but you didn't really realize them at the time. . .
. At the time, I thought I knew him, you know. But then, like,
after all this, I really didn't know him at all, because . . .
like, this silly person was just a cover-up of this other guy.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Matthew R. Neamon, 9th grader, Carneal's
friend since second grade. (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   He brought a gun to school, and he showed it to me . . . the
November before. . . . He had it in his backpack. . . . It was a
pistol . . . semiautomatic. . . . He was like, ``Do you want to see
something?'' And I was like, sure. And he showed it to me. And,
`Ooh, a gun' . . . There was a rumor on other days that he had one.
. . . Just ``Michael has a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was it against rules at school to have guns there?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you tell anybody about it?
</P>
<P>
   A: No.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why not?
</P>
<P>
   A: Like I said, because I didn't want to get my friend in
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Amanda M. Jones, ninth grader, was
Michael's girlfriend the fall before the shootings. (END ITALICS

</P>
<P>
   ((He was)) usually quiet, but then sometimes he would get noisy
and annoying. . . . More when we were in high school, probably to
fit in. . . . He got picked on a lot because he was small and _ I
don't know _ he didn't play football, or anything. But a lot of
freshmen got picked on. . . . He wasn't a big part of the jock
population. . . . He just wasn't real tough and big. He was small.
. . .. He was stranger than we are, more strange.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you ever hear Michael talk about taking over the school?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yeah. Not as in seriously. A lot of kids talk about taking
over the school . . . No one likes school, so. . . . Every school
I've been to, someone would mention we should burn down the school.
It's not strange for someone to not like school. . . . It was
around Halloween, he brought a gun to school that he was trying to
sell.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you know what kind of gun it was?
</P>
<P>
   A: A revolver? It's silver and the kind that has the spinny
thing that comes out. . . . For some reason, it didn't strike me as
odd.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Really?
</P>
<P>
   A: I just thought, well, he's trying to sell a gun. . . . I
didn't really _ I didn't think, ``Oh, goodness, he's going to kill
someone at school,'' because that just never had happened.

<P>
   Q: He was ((at your house)) the Saturday before the shootings?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. . . . I talked to Michael Carneal. . . . His sister had
told me that he was doing stuff with credit cards, buying stuff off
the Internet with credit card numbers that were not his. And I
warned him about getting in trouble and getting caught. And I told
him that if he got caught, he had to shower in front of a bunch of
guys, and probably wouldn't like that. That's about all I can
remember of the discussion.

   Q: OK. Did he have any weapons with him at the time?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, he did.
</P>
<P>
   A: There was a handgun and some rifles. They were . . . on the
floor, like, on a blanket type thing ((in my brother's bedroom)). .

<P>
   A: It didn't seem too out of place. . . .

<P>
   Q: You go in there to counsel Michael Carneal about other
matters. You see other weapons there. You counsel Michael; is that
right?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does he say in response to that?
</P>
<P>
   A: Wait until Monday.

</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a statement here that you gave to the police. . . .
And it says . . . ``Michael Carneal said we should go into ((the
school administration)) office and shoot them while in their
offices. Barnett responded `Yeah, yeah,' but didn't think anything
about it.'' . . . What was your reaction to that statement, when
Carneal made it to you?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not much of one. It's just idle conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You considered a statement that Michael Carneal wanted to go
in and shoot school personnel an idle statement?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sure. I mean, I'm sure people, all over the place, say random
things like that, you know, not meaning anything by them. You know,
like, ``I really hate this,'' you know. And they don't mean
anything by it. And people don't take them seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And so, people, according to you, don't take threats to
murder like this seriously?
</P>
<P>
   A: It wasn't a threat to murder, though. . . . It was probably
just us hanging around at school, at lunch.

   ((On the morning of the shootings)) I arrived at school
approximately 7:35 a.m. . . . Usually, I was there a little bit
later. But I did get there to see what Michael was going to do. . .
. Because he told us, on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, that he
was going to do something. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q: And you took him seriously enough, at least to the extent
that you thought he was going to do something that was going to be
worth watching, right?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And you showed up to school early that day so you could see?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: All right. And during the time that you were thinking about
this, between the Wednesday that he made the statement and the
Monday morning that he actually did it, did you contact anybody
about it and tell them?
</P>
<P>
   A: No.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why not?
</P>
<P>
   A: I was expecting a practical joke of some sort. . . . Perhaps
fireworks, water balloons, something of that nature.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Toby Nace, a ninth grader, was once one of
Michael's best friends, although they had drifted apart. (END
ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   After we watched a movie, ``Basketball Diaries'' ((which
includes a fantasy of a violent school shooting)), he said that
would be neat to go in the school and shoot people that you don't
like. . . . And he said, if you're going to take over the school,
you could use those axes. . . . I just went along with him. I said,
``Yeah, if you're going to take over the school, you would have to
cut the phone lines,'' or something. . . . He just did stuff to get
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ((The morning of the murders)) I seen him put ear plugs in, and
((I)) say, ``Hey, it would be funny if you wore those during class
while the teacher is giving a speech.'' And he laughed. And then I
just turned around. And then, when I turned back, he was pulling a
gun out of his backpack.

VACATIONERS, BEWARE THE DOLDRUMS OF AUGUST 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)  
 By KURT M. CAMPBELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's summertime and the living is easy, or at least it is
supposed to be. Every August, exhausted policy-makers, tired
traders and burnt-out journalists flee their high-powered jobs for
two weeks of R&AMP;R in the Hamptons, at Martha's Vineyard or on the
Maryland shore. Pity these poor power players; they're just looking
for a few days of sun and sand with the kids before returning to
the frenzy that will begin again the day after Labor Day. But if
the 1990s are any indication, August can be the cruelest month for
those who cherish international calm and stable currency markets.
</P>
<P>
   This year, in some ways, is worse than usual, if only because
the political conventions have put a major crimp in August
getaways, as they do every four years. But they cannot seriously be
considered in the same category as what has been happening in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the record for August crises in the last decade _ it
truly is a remarkable collection of calamities,'' said James
Steinberg, the recently departed deputy national security adviser
in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the mother of all August crises with Saddam's
invasion of Kuwait at the beginning of the decade in 1990,'' he
said, ``along with several other Iraqi provocations during
subsequent Augusts. There were also the embassy bombings in Africa,
various Balkan ordeals and the Atlanta Olympics terrorist bombing
in 1996.'' That last actually took place at the end of July, but
the reaction and investigation demanded attention well into August.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg's list covers various national security emergencies,
but it doesn't have to end there. Crises in the globalized
financial sector have also been striking with irritating regularity
in August, which was once synonymous with portfolio stability.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government defaulted on its debt in August 1998,
setting nerves on edge among money managers. The so-called
Committee to Save the World convened regularly by conference call
from vacation locales that summer, with Robert Rubin, who was then
the Treasury secretary, and Lawrence Summers, his deputy at the
time (and now his successor) holding the fate of the world in one
hand and a bonefishing rod and tennis racket, respectively, in the
other.
</P>
<P>
   But the picture is not all bleak. Advances in technology have
enabled crisis managers and journalists to communicate with
encryption or log on and file during even the most challenging
international crises. This can lead to unusual sightings on some of
the nation's beaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a guy on a Hampton beach a few years ago who was
building a sand castle one minute with his daughter, and the next
was screaming at the top of his lungs into his cell phone that he
had to have the numbers on Nigerian debt immediately,'' said Dane
Neller, the CEO of the New York-based gourmet food chain, Dean &AMP;
Deluca. ``He used his daughter's little yellow shovel to transcribe
the financial figures in the sand, breaching the castle's moat in
the process.''
</P>
<P>
   James Adams, the very British former Washington correspondent
for the London Sunday Times, recalls a fellow becoming so engrossed
in an August article he was composing on a blanket on a beach in
Weekapaug, R.I., that he lost track of the advancing tide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very messy business indeed,'' Adams said. Sand and
sea water are now more worrisome hazards to beach users with
technology than sharks or stinging jellyfish.
</P>
<P>
   However, sometimes a crisis demands more than simply phoning in.
For many power players in Washington and New York, the only thing
worse than a crisis in August that demands their attention is a
crisis in August that can somehow be managed or covered without
their direct participation. There is no greater shame for a true
insider than to arrive at a chic Martha's Vineyard dinner party
only to find that the competition has been urgently called back to
the city, while he or she is left to sunburn and stew about the
unfairness of it all.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one key for any self-respecting crisis manager on
vacation is maintaining a flexible outlook that can be summed up in
two words: refundable tickets.
</P>
<P>
   One Washington spouse, asking not to be identified for fear of
jinxing this year's annual getaway, confided that ``during one
Middle East flare-up a few summers back, my husband insisted on
driving four hours back to the White House situation room for a
30-minute meeting at which most of the participants were wearing
either khakis or tennis togs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just say,'' she added, ``we had a few Augusts back then
where we had a failure to recreate.''

THE ROAD LESS TRAVELED TO THE WHITE HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)  
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Back in 1832, the Anti-Masons were growing so concerned
about secret societies and ruling elites in young America that they
ran a candidate for president, William Wirt of Maryland, a former
U.S. attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Wirt failed to arouse much interest, scoring less than 8 percent
of the popular vote in an election won by Andrew Jackson. But the
erstwhile lawyer started a trend that has continued to this day,
offering voters a third presidential option to the major political
parties of the time. In every presidential election since then but
one (1864), a Whig, Free Soiler, Abolitionist, Greenback or some
such third-party standard bearer has won votes. This year, it's
Ralph Nader for the Green Party and either Pat Buchanan or John
Hagelin for the Reform Party, which holds its convention this week
in Long Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   But just what role can these mavericks hope to play? The
historical answer appears to be a small, but occasionally important
one. About the best any of them did was Theodore Roosevelt in 1912,
when he broke from the Republican Party of President William H.
Taft to run as the candidate of the Bull Moose party and won 27
percent of the popular vote. That was good enough to get Woodrow
Wilson into the White House for the Democrats. Similarly, many
Republicans still blame Ross Perot for siphoning off conservative
voters in 1992 and helping Bill Clinton defeat President George
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In general, third-party presidential candidates fare better when
they have something to rail against. Martin Van Buren, of the Free
Soil party, did so against slavery in 1848, as did Perot against
globalism and the loss of American jobs. Both lost, but like other
third-party insurgents, they played a vital role in the political
system by expanding it and maybe even preserving it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the Communist Party in the 1930s,'' said Richard
Winger, editor of Ballot Access News, a publication that follows
election laws. ``By running thousands of candidates for state and
local offices, it served as a safety valve, directing their efforts
into the system instead of bombing and rioting.''
</P>
<P>
   Historically, third parties have also called attention to issues
ignored or avoided by the major parties of the day. The Reform
Party helped to make the economy such an important issue during the
1992 election that, shortly after his victory, President Clinton
held an economic summit meeting. Much the same thing appears to be
at work this year. Nader and Buchanan, who agree on little else,
have each asserted that the Republican and Democratic parties have
effectively merged into a political corpocracy, in which both
parties feed at the trough of big business campaign contributions
and ignore the needs of ordinary citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Nader, a longtime consumer advocate who won almost 700,000 votes
in the 1996 election, has taken particularly derisive aim this year
at the major party candidates, Vice President Al Gore and Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas, calling them, ``Tweedledee and
Tweedledum,'' although he does not specify who is which.
</P>
<P>
   Of the two outsiders this year, Nader is poised to have the
greater impact on the election. Gnawing at Gore from the left,
where he has considerable support among environmentalists and union
workers, Nader has polled as high as 10 percent in some states,
which could be enough to throw one or two of them to Bush. If that
should happen in California, where Nader is popular among
disaffected Democrats, Gore would have little chance of winning.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats might consider sending a few million in campaign
funds to Buchanan, a far-right conservative who is polling so low
these days that it hurts Gore by not providing a counterbalance to
Nader. As an ardent opponent of free trade, abortion rights and
U.S. military involvement abroad, Buchanan might have earned wider
support if Bush had chosen a more moderate running mate than Dick
Cheney. But Cheney's past positions on national defense, trade,
abortion and other issues are close enough to Bush's _ and
Buchanan's _ that Buchanan cannot claim to be the conservative
alternative to a moderate Republican ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's one advantage over Bush, as Steven J. Rosenstone,
dean of the College of Liberal Arts at the University of Minnesota,
said in an interview, is an outsized personality that allows him to
be ``more vociferous, more outrageous,'' calling attention to
issues he cares about.
</P>
<P>
   That might not be enough this year. In his 1996 book, ``Third
Parties in America,'' Rosenstone wrote, ``Most importantly, third
parties are expressions of discontent with the major parties and
their candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   With the nation enjoying economic prosperity and the world
largely at peace, neither Nader nor Buchanan seems likely to
persuade the electorate that the major party candidates cannot
steer a proper course into the future.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Rosenstone contends, the best third-party leaders
have ``magnetic personalities'' and voting for them is motivated by
any of three factors: ``major party deterioration, attractive
third-party candidates who present a viable alternative to the

   While it does not appear those factors apply enough this year to
draw more more than marginal attention to Nader or Buchanan (whose

there is some evidence to suggest that Americans increasingly enjoy
having political options. The last two presidential elections were
the first consecutive pair since 1856 and 1860 in which alternative
parties have won as much as 10 percent of the popular vote. To some
political experts, that portends a trend.

to 20 percent of the votes, as a matter of course, are cast for

America remains the anomaly. We have this huge, terrifically
diverse country where most people are still just voting for two
parties. But I think it's changing.''

THE ROAD LESS TRAVELED TO THE WHITE HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)  
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Back in 1832, the Anti-Masons were growing so concerned
about secret societies and ruling elites in young America that they
ran a candidate for president, William Wirt of Maryland, a former
U.S. attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Wirt failed to arouse much interest, scoring less than 8 percent
of the popular vote in an election won by Andrew Jackson. But the
erstwhile lawyer started a trend that has continued to this day,
offering voters a third presidential option to the major political
parties of the time. In every presidential election since then but
one (1864), a Whig, Free Soiler, Abolitionist, Greenback or some
such third-party standard bearer has won votes. This year, it's
Ralph Nader for the Green Party and either Pat Buchanan or John
Hagelin for the Reform Party, which holds its convention this week
in Long Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   But just what role can these mavericks hope to play? The
historical answer appears to be a small, but occasionally important
one. About the best any of them did was Theodore Roosevelt in 1912,
when he broke from the Republican Party of President William H.
Taft to run as the candidate of the Bull Moose party and won 27
percent of the popular vote. That was good enough to get Woodrow
Wilson into the White House for the Democrats. Similarly, many
Republicans still blame Ross Perot for siphoning off conservative
voters in 1992 and helping Bill Clinton defeat President George
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In general, third-party presidential candidates fare better when
they have something to rail against. Martin Van Buren, of the Free
Soil party, did so against slavery in 1848, as did Perot against
globalism and the loss of American jobs. Both lost, but like other
third-party insurgents, they played a vital role in the political
system by expanding it and maybe even preserving it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the Communist Party in the 1930s,'' said Richard
Winger, editor of Ballot Access News, a publication that follows
election laws. ``By running thousands of candidates for state and
local offices, it served as a safety valve, directing their efforts
into the system instead of bombing and rioting.''
</P>
<P>
   Historically, third parties have also called attention to issues
ignored or avoided by the major parties of the day. The Reform
Party helped to make the economy such an important issue during the
1992 election that, shortly after his victory, President Clinton
held an economic summit meeting. Much the same thing appears to be
at work this year. Nader and Buchanan, who agree on little else,
have each asserted that the Republican and Democratic parties have
effectively merged into a political corpocracy, in which both
parties feed at the trough of big business campaign contributions
and ignore the needs of ordinary citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Nader, a longtime consumer advocate who won almost 700,000 votes
in the 1996 election, has taken particularly derisive aim this year
at the major party candidates, Vice President Al Gore and Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas, calling them, ``Tweedledee and
Tweedledum,'' although he does not specify who is which.
</P>
<P>
   Of the two outsiders this year, Nader is poised to have the
greater impact on the election. Gnawing at Gore from the left,
where he has considerable support among environmentalists and union
workers, Nader has polled as high as 10 percent in some states,
which could be enough to throw one or two of them to Bush. If that
should happen in California, where Nader is popular among
disaffected Democrats, Gore would have little chance of winning.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats might consider sending a few million in campaign
funds to Buchanan, a far-right conservative who is polling so low
these days that it hurts Gore by not providing a counterbalance to
Nader. As an ardent opponent of free trade, abortion rights and
U.S. military involvement abroad, Buchanan might have earned wider
support if Bush had chosen a more moderate running mate than Dick
Cheney. But Cheney's past positions on national defense, trade,
abortion and other issues are close enough to Bush's _ and
Buchanan's _ that Buchanan cannot claim to be the conservative
alternative to a moderate Republican ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's one advantage over Bush, as Steven J. Rosenstone,
dean of the College of Liberal Arts at the University of Minnesota,
said in an interview, is an outsized personality that allows him to
be ``more vociferous, more outrageous,'' calling attention to
issues he cares about.
</P>
<P>
   That might not be enough this year. In his 1996 book, ``Third
Parties in America,'' Rosenstone wrote, ``Most importantly, third
parties are expressions of discontent with the major parties and
their candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   With the nation enjoying economic prosperity and the world
largely at peace, neither Nader nor Buchanan seems likely to
persuade the electorate that the major party candidates cannot
steer a proper course into the future.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Rosenstone contends, the best third-party leaders
have ``magnetic personalities'' and voting for them is motivated by
any of three factors: ``major party deterioration, attractive
third-party candidates who present a viable alternative to the
major party nominees and an influx of voters with no loyalty to the
two major parties.'' Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota arguably fits
this description.
</P>
<P>
   While it does not appear those factors apply enough this year to
draw more more than marginal attention to Nader or Buchanan (whose
opponent Hagelin has not even registered on recent national polls),
there is some evidence to suggest that Americans increasingly enjoy
having political options. The last two presidential elections were

<P>
   In a business culture that has long fixated ambivalently on the
image of computer wizards brewing technological revolution in their
garage, the back-story to the pair of digital copyright battles
being waged in federal courts on either coast has a familiar ring.
</P>
<P>
   The Napster case in San Francisco involves a 19-year-old college
student who created a program allowing him to swap music files with
his friends. The program became so popular so fast that the major
record labels claim it has led to widespread music piracy,
threatening their ability to turn a profit and the incentive of
artists to create music.
</P>
<P>
   The DVD trial in New York began with a Norwegian high school
student who cracked the encryption program protecting Hollywood's
digitized movies from unauthorized copying. Leading movie studios
argue that unless a judge stops a Web site publisher from
distributing the 16-year-old's decryption code, they will soon
suffer the same fate as the record industry.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on who you believe, these are either tales of David
vs. Goliath or of irresponsible hackers taking aim at the
establishment. But no matter which side you're on, both cases have
underscored the unprecedented ability of individuals armed with
digital technology to upset the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very much looking at a biological model of an
epidemic,'' said Esther Dyson, publisher of the technology
newsletter Release 1.0. ``On the Internet, a product doesn't
require a central host and it doesn't require central distribution,
it just spreads. It's new in business. It's been going on a long
time in viruses.''
</P>
<P>
   As more people connect to the Internet, with faster connections,
the information released on it takes on ever-greater momentum and
scale. Services like Napster are seen as only the beginning of a
technological siege for industries founded on traditional notions
of intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many Internet watchers, Dyson among them, believe that
companies that put information online, from music to books to
software, may have to resign themselves to relinquishing control
over that material. The fact that you copyrighted something simply
may no longer entitle you to control it or get paid for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an idea whose time has come,'' said John Perry Barlow,
the vice chairman of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and author
of an essay ``The Economy of Ideas,'' which in 1994 predicted a
fundamental shift in the way intellectual property is valued.
``We're dealing with a profound historical shift in the economy
that has been enabled by technology.''
</P>
<P>
   This is essentially what happened in the Napster and DVD cases,
and though federal judges saw fit to issue injunctions in each
case, that may be irrelevant in the world of electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most telling moments in the Napster saga came
between the time Judge Marilyn Patel issued a temporary injunction
effectively shutting down the service and the stay that was granted
not quite 48 hours later by a higher court. Despite Patel's clear
statement that Napster was likely to be found guilty of
contributing to copyright infringement, millions of individuals
swarmed to download music from the service, or learn about
alternative services that provide the means to swap music files.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the DVD decryption code patched together by Jon
Johansen in Norway has been posted on hundreds of Web sites besides
the one that Hollywood has taken to court, many of which say they
are simply upholding their right to share technology information.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, technology and its users are undermining
traditional institutions, while asserting a populist sense of what
is ethical that may well clash with what is legal. That has raised
questions that go well beyond the outcome of the court battles.
</P>
<P>
   What happens, for instance, if Patel in San Francisco and Judge
Lewis A. Kaplan in New York come down on the side of the
entertainment industry, but the distribution of both copyrighted
music and a computer code that cracks legally protected encryption
continues undeterred?
</P>
<P>
   ``Law is very vulnerable when it makes orders that don't get
enforced,'' said Charles Nesson, director of the Berkman Center for
Internet and Society at Harvard University. ``Law consists of two
things, the coercive power to impose a sanction on someone who
violates it and the willingness of people to obey the law without
actually putting it to the test. The more you undermine the
credibility of law with the people who are governed by it, the more
you need sanctions to keep order.''
</P>
<P>
   But can any court arrest 20 million Napster users around the
world? Intellectual property has always depended on both legal and
physical barriers to copying, Nesson noted. With the physical
barriers all but removed, the reliance of copyright holders on the
law may be straining it beyond its capacity to be effective.
</P>
<P>
   These information-sharing technologies are still in their
infancy. Napster's file-swapping progeny, like Freenet and
Gnutella, dispense with any vestiges of central information
altogether. Everything from video games to Scientology texts are
being traded over such networks, which hit the Internet just a few
months ago. And the inventors of even newer ones with names like
MojoNation and COLAVision were demonstrating their wares last week
at a hacker convention in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Based on what has become known as ``peer-to-peer'' technology,
such services have vastly simplified the ability of individuals to
trade files of any sort among themselves, and to decide for
themselves whether or not to obey copyright law. Most seem to be
choosing the latter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use Napster, I'd be crazy if I wouldn't,'' wrote one
14-year-old in an e-mail message after Patel issued her preliminary
injunction last month. ``It lets me sample the songs from a CD and
I get to see if I want to buy the CD or not. I don't find it to be
any damaging to any musicians. I actually think it is helping
them.''
</P>
<P>
   In part because that attitude may herald a shift in the law and
in part because the music industry will face other, less
centralized networks using similar technology, many legal experts
and economists believe that the record labels would be better off
adapting their business models than suing Napster for copyright
infringement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still very much a common-law culture,'' said Lawrence
Lessig, a law professor at Stanford University who has submitted a
brief urging that Napster not be shut down. ``If the law does not
accord with the view of the common kid, then the law will change.''
</P>
<P>
   Few of the Napster refugees flooding the Gnutella mailing list
with set-up questions last week seemed terribly concerned about the
outcome of the San Francisco case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can someone please inform me on how to start everything up,''
read one typical post by a new user, ``I wanna get to mp3's.''

SENDING A MESSAGE: CONVENTION SUCCESS MORE CRUCIAL FOR GORE THAN
BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)  
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Susan Estrich, the manager of Michael Dukakis'
unsuccessful 1988 campaign for president, was rattling off ways Al
Gore could use the Democratic convention to rebut George W. Bush's
accomplished performance last week when she stopped short and
laughed at herself. ``Most people won't be listening to any of
this!'' she exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   Estrich may be on to something. It is true that Bush went a long
way toward achieving two essential goals: to recast the Republican
Party's image as sunny, nonthreatening and compassionate, and to
demonstrate that he was not the untested political ingenue that the
Democrats have labeled him.
</P>
<P>
   But equally significant, at least as far as Gore is concerned,
was Bush's success at orchestrating a convention that was
uncontroversial and, for the most part, dull. At a time when public
interest in political conventions is already in decline, the GOP
convention may have in effect been an anti-commercial _ Don't Watch
This! _ for Gore's convention next Monday in Los Angeles. Gore is
getting a lot of advice on what he should do to spark his campaign,
but it's not going to help his already uphill effort if no one is
watching.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the convention didn't draw many viewers, its essential
message _ a blurring of ideological differences between Republicans
and Democrats _ was seeping out. A candidate doesn't have to be
watched to be effective. As recent interviews with the voting
public have made clear, it's not how many were watching but who:
the opinions of those who do watch filter down to the public at
large. Others turn to news coverage on television and in local
newspapers. Convention viewership, however, was generally lower
than in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Bush delivered a lively acceptance speech, and Dick
Cheney, his running mate, went on the attack. But dissent was so
discouraged that hours would slog by without any indication that
this was a partisan gathering, much less a Republican one. The
production, often as relentlessly upbeat as a Pepsi commercial,
sent million of potential viewers (and potential voters) scurrying
to find more compelling fare on television.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican convention was important to Bush, who entered it
ahead in the polls, but the Democratic convention is crucial for
Gore's hopes of moving from his residence on the grounds of the
Naval Observatory to the White House next January. The gathering
next week is likely to be one of the last high-profile
opportunities that this very familiar political figure has to get
voters to reconsider him, outside of the expected debates. Oddly,
it is now Gore, who has spent a lifetime in government service,
rather than Bush, who is in the position of having to make the
speech of his life.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of viewership aside, there is no shortage of advice on
what Gore should do and say once he gets to Los Angeles. Indeed,
there is a surprising amount of agreement among Democrats and
Republicans alike.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush needed to demonstrate that he had both intellect and an
engaging personality, Gore probably needs to show the reverse: to
demonstrate that he is something else than the brainy if drab No. 2
who has stood off to the side of the national stage for the past
eight years. Accordingly, Gore's campaign has assembled a heavy
package of biographical tributes ( Gore, you will learn, served in
Vietnam) in their undying hope that to know Gore is to like him.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the orchestrated fluffiness of the Republican
convention is being seized by Gore's advisers as a tactical
mistake. And in response, a strategy is taking shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given that the Republican convention avoided issues, we ought
to have an issues-oriented convention,'' said Sen. Charles Schumer,
D-N.Y. ``And everything should be related to prosperity. I am of
the view that that is our strongest suit. And I would pound that
theme in.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is what Gore is intending to do. His advisers say
convention speakers in Los Angeles, and the vice president as he
campaigns en route, will offer detailed discussions of one
Democratic initiative each day, starting with Social Security. They
are already encouraging reporters to draw contrasts to what they
describe _ with a touch of envy _ as Bush's ``cotton-candy
convention.''
</P>
<P>
   The risk is that this might evoke an image of Gore as the
dreary, pedantic candidate at a blackboard, holding a piece of
chalk. That said, Gore may not have much choice. ``Bush has a more
appealing personality than Gore and the Republicans have put on an
appealing convention in terms of image,'' said William Kristol, the
publisher of the conservative Weekly Standard. ``They need
desperately to make this a campaign about issues, rather than
image. And here they have been given something of an opening.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Gore's advisers are taking solace in the fact that
Bush spoke first, giving Gore the last word. For example, in what
was probably the central political formulation of Bush's speech,
the Republican argued that President Clinton and Gore squandered
eight years of prosperity. It opened the way for Gore to respond
with what his aides asserted was abundant evidence to the contrary
_ as well as to remind voters of what the economy was like under
the George Bush who preceded Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore now has an opportunity,'' said Michael McCurry, the
former White House press secretary under Clinton. ``They're going
to have to go back and remind people of what they've done for the
past eight years.''

   The other George Bush, by the way, was in the convention hall
almost as often as the most conscientious delegate, sitting in a
VIP section that included a who's who of Republican warhorses:
among them, 87-year-old Gerald Ford, former Cabinet officials under
Presidents Bush and Reagan, and Cheney, who served as defense
secretary under President Bush. This aging if distinguished tableau
of power offers another point of contrast that Gore intends to make
at the convention.

<P>
   ``The mistake they made is the they posited themselves in the

``And that's from the moment of the Cheney selection forward. The

<P>
   Gore is well aware, an aide said, that none of this will matter
if no one is there to hear his tree fall. His campaign has begun to
try to deal with that: Gore will, for example, do hard-driving,
telegenic events during the day intended to get him on the network
news, and is considering a range of interviews with unusual
sources, from MTV to Jay Leno, reminiscent of what Clinton did in
1992. The daytime events are designed to get the vice president on
the television news every night, with the convention serving as
something of a late-evening coda that reinforces the message of the
day.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for Gore now is grabbing the the public's
attention. Even someone like Estrich who has lived and breathed
politics for more than 20 years had little interest in tuning into
the high point of the Republican convention, Bush's speech. In the
midst of an interview last Thursday, she noted that she had
arranged to have drinks that night with another Democrat involved
in planning Gore's convention. Their appointment, she said, was
scheduled at the time Bush would take the stage to offer his vision
for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watch his speech?'' she said. ``Why? I'll watch a clip in the
morning.''

SENDING A MESSAGE: CONVENTION SUCCESS MORE CRUCIAL FOR GORE THAN
BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)  
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Susan Estrich, the manager of Michael Dukakis'
unsuccessful 1988 campaign for president, was rattling off ways Al
Gore could use the Democratic convention to rebut George W. Bush's
accomplished performance last week when she stopped short and
laughed at herself. ``Most people won't be listening to any of
this!'' she exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   Estrich may be on to something. It is true that Bush went a long
way toward achieving two essential goals: to recast the Republican
Party's image as sunny, nonthreatening and compassionate, and to
demonstrate that he was not the untested political ingenue that the
Democrats have labeled him.
</P>
<P>
   But equally significant, at least as far as Gore is concerned,
was Bush's success at orchestrating a convention that was
uncontroversial and, for the most part, dull. At a time when public
interest in political conventions is already in decline, the GOP
convention may have in effect been an anti-commercial _ Don't Watch
This! _ for Gore's convention next Monday in Los Angeles. Gore is
getting a lot of advice on what he should do to spark his campaign,
but it's not going to help his already uphill effort if no one is
watching.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the convention didn't draw many viewers, its essential
message _ a blurring of ideological differences between Republicans
and Democrats _ was seeping out. A candidate doesn't have to be
watched to be effective. As recent interviews with the voting
public have made clear, it's not how many were watching but who:
the opinions of those who do watch filter down to the public at
large. Others turn to news coverage on television and in local
newspapers. Convention viewership, however, was generally lower
than in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Bush delivered a lively acceptance speech, and Dick
Cheney, his running mate, went on the attack. But dissent was so
discouraged that hours would slog by without any indication that
this was a partisan gathering, much less a Republican one. The
production, often as relentlessly upbeat as a Pepsi commercial,
sent million of potential viewers (and potential voters) scurrying
to find more compelling fare on television.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican convention was important to Bush, who entered it
ahead in the polls, but the Democratic convention is crucial for
Gore's hopes of moving from his residence on the grounds of the
Naval Observatory to the White House next January. The gathering
next week is likely to be one of the last high-profile
opportunities that this very familiar political figure has to get
voters to reconsider him, outside of the expected debates. Oddly,
it is now Gore, who has spent a lifetime in government service,
rather than Bush, who is in the position of having to make the
speech of his life.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of viewership aside, there is no shortage of advice on
what Gore should do and say once he gets to Los Angeles. Indeed,
there is a surprising amount of agreement among Democrats and
Republicans alike.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush needed to demonstrate that he had both intellect and an
engaging personality, Gore probably needs to show the reverse: to
demonstrate that he is something else than the brainy if drab No. 2
who has stood off to the side of the national stage for the past
eight years. Accordingly, Gore's campaign has assembled a heavy
package of biographical tributes ( Gore, you will learn, served in
Vietnam) in their undying hope that to know Gore is to like him.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the orchestrated fluffiness of the Republican
convention is being seized by Gore's advisers as a tactical
mistake. And in response, a strategy is taking shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given that the Republican convention avoided issues, we ought
to have an issues-oriented convention,'' said Sen. Charles Schumer,
D-N.Y. ``And everything should be related to prosperity. I am of
the view that that is our strongest suit. And I would pound that
theme in.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is what Gore is intending to do. His advisers say
convention speakers in Los Angeles, and the vice president as he
campaigns en route, will offer detailed discussions of one
Democratic initiative each day, starting with Social Security. They
are already encouraging reporters to draw contrasts to what they
describe _ with a touch of envy _ as Bush's ``cotton-candy
convention.''
</P>
<P>
   The risk is that this might evoke an image of Gore as the
dreary, pedantic candidate at a blackboard, holding a piece of
chalk. That said, Gore may not have much choice. ``Bush has a more
appealing personality than Gore and the Republicans have put on an
appealing convention in terms of image,'' said William Kristol, the
publisher of the conservative Weekly Standard. ``They need
desperately to make this a campaign about issues, rather than
image. And here they have been given something of an opening.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Gore's advisers are taking solace in the fact that
Bush spoke first, giving Gore the last word. For example, in what
was probably the central political formulation of Bush's speech,
the Republican argued that President Clinton and Gore squandered
eight years of prosperity. It opened the way for Gore to respond
with what his aides asserted was abundant evidence to the contrary
_ as well as to remind voters of what the economy was like under
the George Bush who preceded Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore now has an opportunity,'' said Michael McCurry, the
former White House press secretary under Clinton. ``They're going
to have to go back and remind people of what they've done for the
past eight years.''
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Late sleepers face schools for early risers
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Not all back-to-school supplies are bought
for kids. Myself, I bought vital equipment for a high school parent
_ a thermos bottle and a coffee mug with a nearly spillproof
plastic top.
</P>
<P>
   The high school's late bell will ring at 7:20 a.m., an hour I
have dedicated my life to avoiding. For the next several years, my
kids and I will be consigned to a world designed for morning
people. And a harsh world it is.
</P>
<P>
   My theory is this happened out of the stealth of morning people.
They are up first, so they have time to run about, get memos signed
and make rules for the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   If a large number of parents aren't morning people, even larger
numbers of teens aren't as well.
</P>
<P>
   Medical studies of sleep published in the 1980s and 1990s have
found, unsurprisingly, that people sleep differently at different
stages of life.
</P>
<P>
   The medical literature says little kids bounce out of bed at
ungodly hours of the dim morning. But teens tend to putter around
the house past midnight and wake up at the crack of noon.
</P>
<P>
   Little kids are alert earlier in the morning. Adolescents are
alert later and need more sleep as they get older.
</P>
<P>
   This is one more new scientific revelation that parents have
known for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what do schools around the nation do? You guessed it. They
tend to start school later for students in lower grades and start
high school at hours associated with milking cows, shipping out to
sea and delivering
</P>
<P>
   newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Who's behind this? Morning people, I suppose. Coaches also like
it because they can hold practices earlier. School administrators
use it to schedule buses in shifts and get more use out of each
bus.
</P>
<P>
   Who else likes it? Oh, just about nobody. Only those annoying
morning people. And maybe convenience store operators and the
powerful spillproof car-mug manufacturers' lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers and administrators in a Minnesota school district
looked at the research in 1996 and read a letter from Minnesota
Medical Association to the state's school superintendents that
urged later starting times for high schools. The Edina, Minn.,
school district responded by resetting tardy bells from 7:25 to
8:30.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators last year said that after almost three years,
absenteeism was down, grades were up and students and teachers were
more alert.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of parents found 95 percent liked the change.
</P>
<P>
   I'm no medical scientist, but later hours just make sense. You
can't reset the body's circadian rhythms by setting alarm clocks to
snarl before sunrise. You only end up with sleep-deprived teens who
can't remember what happened in first period.
</P>
<P>
   My house of late risers faces a hard transition next week. My
kids will be sleepwalking from the car. And my editors will have
their work cut out for them after I stumble through the doors and
try to make my fingers hit specific letters on a coffee-splattered
keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I'm just a late riser staggering around a world organized
by people who bounded to their desks before I had time to stare
down my cornflakes. A half-shaven whiner. But for once, medical
science backs me up.
</P>
<P>
   Late rising is not slothfulness. It is the result of
half-understand bodily rhythms. It is one more strange thing that
happens to a normal brain during adolescence. Much like the enzyme
that makes them wear ugly
</P>
<P>
   clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Reforming us is futile and all we need is just another hour. And
caffeine.

 &HT;    The doctors are in
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Amos limps into the cafe this morning, picks
up his decaf from Robin, and hobbles over to join us. ``Looks like
you're just about fit for shootin','' Cal says to his old buddy.
``Whatsa' matter'' Lucy give you that swift kick you been asking
for?''
</P>
<P>
   Amos pulls over an empty chair to rest his leg on and sits with
an obvious effort. ``I think I got a toe nail growing in wrong.''
Benny says not to complain because at his age he's lucky to have
anything at all that's still growing.
</P>
<P>
   I scan the faces around the table. Most are well into their 70s.
Benny admits to 75, but he's been saying that for the whole 16
years I've been drinking coffee with him. Once, when someone asked
him how I had come by my seat at his table, he said it was because
I used to sit at the bar and make goo goo eyes at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``So,'' Gene asks Amos as he dumps the third creamer into his
cup and makes a face at the results, ``you taking that toe to the
doctor to get it hacked on?'' Gene's new here. Not a real farmer.
Moved onto 10 acres about a year ago, has one row of tomato plants,
and no idea of the leading question he's just asked.
</P>
<P>
   Amos wags his head. ``What do you take me for,'' he asks, ``some
kind of a sissy?'' Running off to the doctor, he reminds Gene, is a
city thing. ``Us country boys are tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Three John Deere ballcaps nod agreement. Benny's wearing his
ten-galinvincibility are getting taller and I'm half-believing them
when the door opens and the two-man crew from the local EMS comes
in for breakfast. One stops and throws an arm over Amos's shoulder
and tells him how great he's looking. ``You know,'' he says to his
partner after a look around our table, ``I transported three of
these guys when they had their heart attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Amos, Benny, and Herb break into big grins _ some tough guys.
Cal turns to Gene and says the two of them must be the only ones
without a zipper in their chests, but Gene says nope, he's got one
too.
</P>
<P>
   Once mortality has been dealt with, however briefly, it's back
to business as usual. Benny has a cure for Amos's foot. He says
it's the same thing they do for horses. ``Fill a burlap bag
half-full of cow manure, stick your foot in it and tie it onto your
leg for three or four days. That'll sure cure what ails you.''
</P>
<P>
   Amos mutters something about having to live in the barn. Gene
asks Benny if he uses the same cure for a sore throat. He says not,
but he does have a cure for baldness _ chicken manure in your
shoes. The longer you wear it the more hair you'll grow.
</P>
<P>
   Gene doesn't know it _ and I won't tell _ but under that
outsized cowboy hat Benny's wearing, he hasn't got two hairs to rub
together. ``Ever practiced what you preach?'' I ask. He grins,
winks, and gives me the goo goo eyes right back.

 &HT;    Drivin' movies
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The 1990s were about the embracing of electronic
devices, ranging from computers to home theater, including movies,
music and video games.
</P>
<P>
   Now many of us are taking the next step: We won't leave home
without them.
</P>
<P>
   This very summer cars, SUVs and minivans are rolling with
dashboard-mounted TVs, five-speaker DVD systems, PlayStation and
Sega equipment for video games, onboard computers for global
communication, and even plain old VCRs gussied up to play tape from
camcorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the big reasons for installing these systems is to
occupy kids during long vacation trips,'' said Justin Burns, a
mobile electronics specialist at HiFi Buys.
</P>
<P>
   Others, industry people say, are buying the fancy systems
because they enhance the feeling of luxury in prized sport-utility
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The electronic entertainment systems can cost from $500 for a
basic console with video to as much as $16,000 to $20,000 _ largely
depending on the number of TV sets installed.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Haynie, a 16-year-old, may have the fanciest 1998 GMC
Jimmy in metro Atlanta, complete with a $7,000 personal computer
system installed by a team of specialists at HiFi Buys. Justin, who
just became old enough to drive, has his system featured in car
audio trade magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justin and many others put these vehicles in competitions all
over the area,'' said Dennis Head, a mobile electronics specialist
who helped install the system. In other words, drag racing and
ear-splitting boombox rallies have given way to dueling
entertainment centers on wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Though it has reached new heights, the trend is not brand new.
Ever since Oldsmobile introduced a videocassette player for its
minivans in 1998, car stereo enthusiasts have been one-upping one
another with dazzling audio systems, and now video.
</P>
<P>
   The industry, always on the lookout for new ways to hook
motorists, has jumped onto the bandwagon, and now every major
manufacturer is offering some form of video in the car.
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent element of the new systems is the 7-inch LCD
video screens that cost $1,100 each. Some vehicles feature as many
as five of them. For example, a system could consist of one on the
dashboard, one or more overhead and others in floor-mounted
consoles, particularly in big vehicles like Chevy Suburbans.
</P>
<P>
   The video systems typically include an electronic lockout to
discourage drivers from watching movies at the dashboard level,
even though expressway jams could hold you motionless long enough
to watch an episode of ``The Young and the Restless.''
</P>
<P>
   The systems do allow the motorist to watch on-screen readouts
from the global positioning service that guides the car to
destinations.
</P>
<P>
   While many new vehicles can come equipped with many features,
others prefer customized systems.
</P>
<P>
   One of the glories of the new fad is that on long trips family
members can each do their own thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of families bring the minivans in,'' says Jason Krimm,
owner of Stereo-in-Dash in Dayton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll hook up a VCR or DVD player and a few screens with
headphones, and you don't have to hear Barney singing. All the
noise will stay in the back.''
</P>
<P>
   Youngsters take to the in-car video like ducks to water.
</P>
<P>
   ``When kids come in, they make a beeline for our mock-up vehicle
that displays the video systems,'' said Shawn Simpson, a mobile
electronics specialist for HiFi Buys.
</P>
<P>
   And he might have added that when the kids come home from a
trip, enhanced by the entertainment on wheels, many of them won't
get out of the car. Some prefer to play their games in the van or
SUV than in their rooms in the house.
</P>
<P>
   So much fun, so much excitement _ but it comes at price.
</P>
<P>
   Most systems require some type of controlling head unit for the
dashboard.
</P>
<P>
   Add a few screens and a six-disc DVD/CD changer, and you'll be
looking at about $5,000 for a Pioneer system, typical of many.
</P>
<P>
   Panasonic has a similar setup. Head unit for $2,000, DVD player
($1,200), 7-inch LCD screen ($1,100) and a Dolby processor for
surround sound ($800), all coming to about $5,100.
</P>
<P>
   While much of this is for fun, there are also elements that help
the work-minded motorist.
</P>
<P>
   There's the Clarion AutoPC, which runs on Microsoft Windows CE
software. The information superhighway can be accessed while on the
interstate with the mobile mini-computer's wireless connection _
with e-mail, stock quotes and faxed information just clicks away.
</P>
<P>
   Want to pass the time with trendy MP3 music files? Software is
on the way for the AutoPC to play your favorite downloads straight
from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Other features of this computer on wheels described at the Web
site www.autopc.com/ can include a $1,300 voice-activated
navigation system and an onboard system to monitor gas consumption
and mileage, tip off impending engine problems and more.
</P>
<P>
   Though sales are sluggish at the moment, promoters of the
computer on wheels say potentially the motorist could have a full
office on wheels.
</P>
<P>
   But bombarding a driver with so many distractions does have its
critics. Highway patrolmen don't like them at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``These video systems pose the same threat as using a cellular
phone does,'' says Sgt. Eric Widmyer of the Ohio Highway Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to include one of these systems, be sure that
all display devices are out of the driver's view. There's too much
happening on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   HOTTEST ADD-ONS
</P>
<P>
   Among the top selling add-on electronic items for cars and vans:
</P>
<P>
   1. Supplementary speakers, mostly bass subwoofers. Typical
12-inch woofer is $199.
</P>
<P>
   2. Radio upgrade, typical to high-quality radio/CD players such
as Alpine for $300 and up.
</P>
<P>
   3. Global positioning service such as the Alpine, at $1,499 to
cover the Southeast or $1,999 for the nation plus much of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   4. Radio-TV consoles for vans and sport-utilities, about $500.
</P>
<P>
   5. Seven-inch LCD video screens, about $1,100.

 &HT;    Latest Windows clearly a winner
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The next version of Windows is supposed to be on the
store shelves in September, and this time it appears to be
something to get at least mildly excited about.
</P>
<P>
   Windows Millennium, which Microsoft has familiarly but
unfortunately nicknamed Windows Me, arrived through the transom
last week in its beta version.
</P>
<P>
   It installed flawlessly over Windows 98, and upon a cursory
examination, it obviously marks a new way of thinking within
Microsoft. The operating system is going the way of the desktop
computer makers _ dividing into two distinct camps, one for
business and one for home.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 2000, of course, is the all-business operating system.
Windows Millennium is the home system. Which is not to say that it
won't serve the same set of users that 95 and 98 did; certainly it
will.
</P>
<P>
   But nearly all the new stuff here is aimed at the home and
family. The thrust is toward a more stable system that requires
less expertise to maintain and fix, an integrated way of finding
help, and vastly improved digital media services.
</P>
<P>
   While the Media Player and Movie Maker are the sexy items, the
PC Health provisions are likely to be more important to more users
in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Microsoft says it has protected some 900 system
files against ``unauthorized'' rewriting or overwriting. Exactly
what constitutes ``unauthorized'' remains to be seen, but it should
be a big step in guarding against the willy-nilly damaging of these
files by someone who doesn't know what he or she is doing.
</P>
<P>
   Even better is the System Restore feature. This is the same
thing, basically, that utilities like Norton have offered for
years, with one major improvement _ it's automatic. Every day, and
every time a new program is installed, Restore makes a ``snapshot''
of the system and stores it away. If something goes haywire, you
can call up System Restore and revert to any one of a number of
earlier points. You can create a restore point, too, if you wish.
</P>
<P>
   The Help file has been greatly supported, and if I understand it
right, once other software vendors have issued revised editions for
Windows Me you'll be able to contact their help desks, as well as
Microsoft's, directly from the Help screen. In turn, they will be
able to determine what sort of system you're running without
playing 20 questions with you, and if a software fix is available,
they can download and install it for you then and there.
</P>
<P>
   The Windows Movie Maker is an editing system that, according to
Microsoft, will allow video makers to pull an amazing amount of
video into the computer at the relatively low resolutions suitable
for small-screen viewing, edit the video and produce little clips
suitable for e-mailing to family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   The Media Player bears no resemblance to the Windows 98 version;
it's been fed steroids to an alarming degree. Now, in addition to
playing the movies you've made or received, it also has a pretty
capable radio tuner with a lot of pre-set stations. Not as slick as
some of the stand-alones but good enough to satisfy most folks for
quite a while.
</P>
<P>
   Audio processing has been fancied up with the addition of new
internal processors.
</P>
<P>
   I've been running the beta version for only a few days now, but
I've had little trouble with it. There seem to be some issued
involving Windows Explorer, which tends to get flaky now and then,
but those will surely be settled by September.
</P>
<P>
   I'm having another problem with a couple of programs, but I
suspect the trouble was there before I installed Windows Me.

 &HT;    Will it butter the bread, too?
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A toaster that costs almost $400 had better come
with arms and legs and be willing to do the windows, too! That will
inevitably be your initial thought about this appliance. And the
fact that the Queen of England owned the very same trinket will do
little to sway your conviction that a $400 toaster is ludicrous at
best.
</P>
<P>
   But then Williams-Sonoma Inc. takes its beautiful, gleaming
Dualit Combi Toaster ($379; www.williams-sonoma.com) and reminds
you of your old $15 appliance and the frustration of having to
shove your bagel halves into the slots, then extract their charred,
crumbled remains with a pair of tongs. The Dualit's slots are wide,
allowing you to easily toast bread, bagels or English muffins.
There's even a separate slot for toasting whole sandwiches and a
slide-out tray that catches all the crumbs. With a slot rocker
switch, timer and manual ejector knob, this toaster will require
more attention than others. Without going so far as to say it's
worth its price, let's just say that once you have the pleasure of
using the Dualit, all the other toasters are bound to be . . . well
. . . toast.

<P>
   NEW IMAC EDITION IS TRULY SPECIAL
</P>
<P>
   Bearing in mind that Apple veritably coined the phrase ``user
friendly,'' it follows that the iMac DV Special Edition (SE)
($1,500; www.apple.com) offers everyperson home computing at its
finest. Bundled with an easy yet detailed tutorial and a formidable
suite of basic computing tools (Internet browser, e-mail, desktop
publishing, graphics editing), the iMac DV SE's crowning feature is
its DVD-ROM drive and the immensely popular iMovie software, a
video editing/moviemaking application for the home movie
enthusiast. Complete with trademark ``FireWire,'' digital video
transfer hardware normally sold separately (and at notable cost)
for Windows-based PCs, the SE is a forward-thinking computer in
that it does not accommodate analog video, the more familiar
camcorder format fast on its way to becoming obsolete. iMacs are
inherently less expandable than PCs, though more adaptable in these
later incarnations. Yet with specific users and hobbyists tackling
specific home computer tasks, the iMac DV SE is just what a great
many new-to-the-modern-era folks are looking for: scaled down,
professional-caliber computing that brings the ``friendliness''
back to user-friendly personal computers. Available in snow and
graphite colors.

 &HT;    Futuristic space wars not captivating
 &HT;    By Yusuf Davis
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As the sequel to ``Imperium Galactica,'' ``IG2'' is an
epic, real-time strategy game that is so big it takes four CDs to
hold all the empire-building, intergalactic warfare and
interstellar game play.
</P>
<P>
   With three main story lines and numerous missions and subplots,
players have almost as many options as features in this massive
program. Each story takes several hours to play, and each provides
a different challenge and approach to the game. A number of the
missions are randomly generated, ensuring that the same game is
never played twice.
</P>
<P>
   All these intricacies and choices were lost on reviewer Jim
Wilson, 17, who said he plays a lot of different types of games on
several different platforms. He called ``IG2'' ``interesting but
not much of an attention-grabber.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got a lot of features and optional stuff, but that's
what's wrong with it,'' said Jim, who tried the game enough times
to not like it very much. ``They tried to do too many things and
didn't make any one thing all that great.''
</P>
<P>
   ``IG2'' takes place in the 26th century, when gamers control a
huge and intricate galaxy. They can discover, colonize or conquer
new planets or research and develop newer, faster spacecraft and
more powerful weapons. No matter what path gamers choose, they must
engage well-armed enemies in distant space to defend their
colishing diplomatic channels with several weird alien races, or
sending spies to infiltrate alien governments to steal their secret
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fighting was pretty cool, and I tried to get into the
spying thing a little more, but after a while, I lost interest,''
Jim said.
</P>
<P>
   Though real-time strategy games are generally his favorite, Jim
said there was something about this game that he ``just couldn't
get into.'' He conceded that others might find it entertaining, but
he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sound and graphics are good and it has a few other good
qualities, but overall I didn't like it all that much,'' said Jim.
``If this is supposed to be an upgrade and an improvement, I'm not
sorry I missed the original.''

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Learning, fun? _ hmmm . . . sounds dubious. But
Mattel Interactive's new Pokemon PokeROMs ($8;
www.pokemon.com/goods/pokeroms.html; for Mac and Windows) deliver
on this claim to a good degree as Pokemon icon Professor Oak leads
kids in activities that promote math and grammar skills. Each
session begins with a ``Concentration''-type puzzle, where math
equations and answers must be matched, each correct union revealing
part of a Pokemon. When the entire image is visible, it can be
saved or printed. The computerized board game finds up to four
players answering grammar questions to move across a virtual game
board. Difficulty can be tailored to children from grades 1 to 5,
but there are too few questions in each level and they quickly
become repetitive. The Pokemon observatory, where you search a map
for Pokemon and click hot spots to reveal them, is lackluster. Each
click seems to reveal a different shot of your Pokemon but, in
reality, only triggers a slide show that will reveal all of the
pictures if you don't click away fast enough. In spite of these
negatives, PokeROMs, available on small, mini CD-ROMs, offer a
non-violent, educational computer experience that children will
enjoy . . . for a while. Here's hoping Mattel adds new questions to
the Series 2 and 3 PokeROMs (due later this year).

   A SWING AND A HIT Hey, batter batter . . . Humongous
Entertainment has updated its Junior Sports collection with
Backyard Baseball 2001 ($20; store.humongous.com; for Mac and
Windows), an update of their best sports title, Backyard Baseball.
So what's different? Well, kids still can choose their own teams
(and team names) but in addition to the original cast of
characters, players also can choose from 31 kid versions of their
favorite big-leaguers such as Sammy Sosa and Randy Johnson
(hands-down the game's best pitcher). Also new in this version is
the option to build your own player from scratch, choosing his or
her batting, fielding, throwing and running skills. Special wacky
abilities are rewarded for outstanding play. A pitcher, for
instance, might get to throw fireballs, which actually burn on
their way to the plate. Batters might get to smack
``undergrounders'' (hits that travel under the playing field and
pop up at random spots). This game features Humongous' trademark
beautiful animation, silly humor and great play. All in all, it's
another home run.

   The next iteration of Microsoft's IntelliMouse line is the
IntelliMouse Optical ($55; www.microsoft.com; for PC and Mac),
complete with the trackball-less, any-surface, never-gum, supremely
accurate ``IntelliEye'' laser reader in its belly. The most
ambitious descendent yet, the USB or PS/2 mouse boasts easy
Internet interfacing with the requisite left and right buttons on
top, a combination scroll wheel and third button nestled in
between, plus a thumb and pinky button on each side insinuated as
``forward'' and ``back'' commands on a browser _ or any function
the user cares to program. A symmetrical, ergonomic device, the
side buttons also accommodate left handed users.
</P>
<P>
   A great, high-tech mouse for all, lefties included, providing
they never share their computer with a righty nor ever use a
righty's computer, in which case, all involved are going to feel
backward.

 &HT;    Wheels provide games an authenic feel
 &HT;    By Troy Oxford
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Racing games are as popular as ever on the video game
console.
</P>
<P>
   From ``Gran Turismo 2'' for the PlayStation to the Dreamcast hit
``Crazy Taxi,'' each platform has a plethora of titles that put you
behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   The ``wheel'' in most cases happens to be a standard controller.
The choice to rip down the road with a directional pad and the
controller buttons may seem easier to some, but racing game
enthusiasts probably want a more authentic feel.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, there are a couple of great racing controls available.
The Interact Concept 4 Racing Wheel and the Mad Catz MC2 Racing
Wheel offer the most natural driving experiences for the Sony
PlayStation and Sega Dreamcast.
</P>
<P>
   Both controls consist of a steering wheel, a set of optional
pedals for braking and acceleration, and vibration feedback.
Despite the similarities, there are quite a few distinguishable
features between these products.
</P>
<P>
   Although both wheels can be placed in your lap or mounted to a
flat surface with suction cups, the Mad Catz wheel offered a little
more comfort and stability with its wide contoured base with
optional straps. The narrower flat base of the Interact controller
was fine when attached to a tabletop but was a little awkward in my
lap.
</P>
<P>
   Both controls look cool and sleek as far as design, but the Mad
Catz controls seem a little lighter and less rugged than the
heavier Interact controls. For instance, the control levers of the
Interact wheel are metal but the Mad Catz levers are plastic.
</P>
<P>
   The true test, however, is control, and both wheels performed
exceptionally. The custom calibration allows you to fine-tune your
steering style. Whether your steering movements are subtle tugs or
sweeping arcs, they can be programmed into the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   One feature that Mad Catz included was a two-position shifter
attached alongside the steering wheel. This is an invaluable
addition that makes it a little more comfortable and intuitive
while controlling a vehicle with a manual transmission.
</P>
<P>
   If the idea of a steering wheel seems a little cumbersome but
you still want an alternative to the standard controller, there is
the Mad Catz Hand Held Racing Wheel for the PlayStation. Although
it looks like some sort of alien weapon, it is surprisingly
comfortable and performs well for most racing games.
</P>
<P>
   Also for the PlayStation is the JogCon by Namco. The hand-held
controller is a perfect hybrid of steering wheel and standard
controller. The vehicle movement is controlled by a motorized
steering dial in the center of the unit. If a sharp turn is handled
at an excessive speed, the wheel realistically tightens and resists
movement. It's a great device to learn how to brake properly for
turns.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the JogCon, however, is that it currently works
only with Namco's racing title ``Ridge Racer 4.'' It will be
supported by ``Ridge Racer 5'' for the PlayStation 2 this fall, but
if you don't plan to pick up either title, it may not have much
value.

 &HT;    New Dreamcast titles have promise
 &HT;    By Troy Oxford
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sega Dreamcast owners probably saved some money on
games the last few months. Besides the much sought after ``Virtua
Tennis,'' Capcom's ``Marvel vs. Capcom 2'' and the sleeper hit
``Wacky Races,'' the games of late June and July weren't that
spectacular. August, however, will be a different story.
</P>
<P>
   As the Oct. 26 launch of the PlayStation 2 draws closer, gamers
are going to see some very impressive Dreamcast titles as a prelude
to the game console competition.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the titles to look forward to this month:
</P>
<P>
   ``Seaman'' (coming Wednesday): A one-of-a-kind title from Sega,
``Seaman'' redefines the virtual pet. With the addition of a
microphone peripheral, you raise, nurture or abuse a wisecracking
fish/man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep Fighter'' (Wednesday): With various deep-sea vehicles and
interesting missions, this underwater title from Ubi Soft looks
promising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ecco the Dolphin'' (Aug. 16): Another aquatic adventure game,
``Ecco the Dolphin'' looks amazing. The undersea world, marine life
and visual effects represent some of the best graphics on the
Dreamcast yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``WWF Royal Rumble'' (Aug. 17): All of your favorite WWF
superstars clobber away in this good-looking wrestling game. With
nine possible wrestlers in the ring at once, this looks like it
will be a smackdown good time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Test Drive V-Rally'' (Aug. 23): This off-road racing title
from Infogrames looks very cool. The game features a big selection
of cars, more than 80 tracks and game play in 12 countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimate Fighting Championship'' (Aug. 30): From the
developers of ``Tony Hawk Pro Skater'' for the Dreamcast comes this
intense fighting simulator. The game features a unique fighting
system, an array of moves and beautifully crafted 3-D models.

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   The glory and majesty that is Sega's new sports sim, Virtua
Tennis ($40; www.sega.com; for the Dreamcast) is such that it could
elicit volumes on how fun the game is to play. But writing tomes
would mean less time to actually play this full-bodied, spectacular
game. Sega's latest stellar sports title is a graphics phenom that
is easy for beginners (controls consist of a minimum of buttons),
but challenging and rewarding for more advanced gamers. With a good
variety of courts, players and bonus games (including several
training courses reminiscent of the ``Crazy Box'' challenges in
Crazy Taxi), Virtua Tennis delivers the goods. If there's one
quibble, it's that there aren't any women players and some of more
famous players on the tennis circuit are missing. But if you can do
without the Williams sisters and Pete Sampras, this is as good as
tennis games get.
</P>
<P>
   N Gen Racing ($40; www.us.infogrames.com; for PlayStation)
brings aspects of Sony's Gran Turismo ultimate car racing game to
the sky. The object of N Gen is to win the race by A.) flying
faster than everyone else, that seems obvious, B.) picking up more
afterburners and blowing past the competition and C.) shooting down
the competition. There is nothing like a friendly race that turns
to machine guns and rockets to determine who's the best. To
progress to higher levels of competition in the game you must earn
licenses to fly higher performance aircraft. The quality of N Gen's
graphics are middle-of-the-road and the realism is . . . well, it's
not realism, but that is what keeps the game fun. You can bounce
off mountains, bridges and water and still have enough strength
left to shoot down your competition. The lower you fly, the faster
the aircraft can go, so contact with inanimate objects is
inevitable. The coolest thing the game also allows you to do is
modify your aircraft _ you can add canards, change engines and
modify the airframes to produce a plane that can handle and kick
serious tail-section. N Gen has two settings for flight-control:
Arcade and Pro. In the arcade-mode the aircraft handles simply, it
banks left and right and up and down. In Pro mode, pull out your
joy stick and hang on. The aircraft can now do anything that your
reflexeded consumer who doesn't deserve to be a millionaire''
emblazoned on their forehead?
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing quite as comforting as being on the right side
of a gun, especially when that gun happens to be an anti-tank
cannon. That's basically the premise and the entire essence of
gameplay in Wizardworks' BeachHead 2000 ($20; www.wizardworks.com;
for the PC), a lone bunkerman trying to thwart a full-on naval
assault in a WWII mock-up. A brazen game that pretty much could
have called itself ``Shooting Private Ryan,'' there's not much
depth or strategy involved here _ no cutting edge graphics, just
glorious explosions, huge kabooms and mindless, shameful catharsis
through random acts of genocide. Sickening, really, but wickedly
brainless and guilty-secret fun.

 &HT;    Buying a good used PC might not be a bad idea
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I bought a used car last week. I can remember years
ago when it was routine to buy a brand new car every two or three
years. It was part of the American tradition just as much as
hand-cranked ice cream and Sunday afternoons spent on the front
porch.
</P>
<P>
   I don't have a front porch anymore, most of my friends would run
in panic at the thought of cranking an ice cream freezer on a 90
degree day, and I no longer buy new cars. I'm not alone.
Reconditioned used cars are becoming more and more popular as new
car prices cross the border between foolish and insane.
</P>
<P>
   The same market shift is coming to the PC world. Buying a new
machine will no longer be the automatic first choice.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's already happening. There have been some really
important changes lately _ including a slowdown in the growth of
the new PC market.
</P>
<P>
   But, more important than that, hardware has finally outdistanced
software. In the past, you almost had to buy a new and more
powerful computer every couple of years just to run the new
software. Computer programs once grew in complexity so fast that
you needed a super PC just to run ordinary programs such as word
processors and Web browsers.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, even a 350 megahertz Pentium machine can handle almost
everything (games excluded) that a home user might want to tackle.
And a 500 megahertz machine is just about right. Given that, a used
computer is a real bargain. Besides, buying a used computer makes
even more sense than buying a used car.
</P>
<P>
   With a car, there are many parts that literally wear out.
Cylinders lose compression, normal wear and tear slowly destroys
transmissions and differentials, and even the interior of a car
slowly deteriorates. But in a computer _ other than the disk
drives, power supply, cooling fan and switches _ all the parts
arknown brand.
</P>
<P>
   4. Before you walk into the store make sure that you know the
selling price for equivalent new machines. That's the only way that
you'll be able to judge whether the price for the used machine is
fair. If, for instance, you can only save $100 or so by buying a
used PC, you're much better off with the new machine.
</P>
<P>
   5. While you may well get excellent advice at the store, it's a
good idea to get some independent help on what type of machine you
need before going in. Otherwise, you'll be in danger from a
fast-talking salesman who may try to convince you that a
too-powerful, or not-powerful-enough machine is right for you.

 &HT;    Walkie-talkies convenient during outings with kids
 &HT;    By Anne Meyers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Amusement park entrances spray visitors out in every
direction inside the park.
</P>
<P>
   From the front gates to the farthest ride, park-goers flow
outward like constantly moving spokes of a Ferris wheel.
</P>
<P>
   As each pair of eyes sets sights on a favorite ride or the next
amusement, the pair beside them sees an entirely different view.
All the while, the Ferris wheel keeps spinning.
</P>
<P>
   Park visits pack what could be days of entertainment into hours
of compressed fun. Amusement park strategists recommend splitting
large groups into smaller teams, giving everyone a stab at
achieving their goals.
</P>
<P>
   The chaotic atmosphere injects added energy into children and
makes a family trip more of a challenge. All this considered, there
is fun within those gated parks, and most people seem to find it.
</P>
<P>
   I recently traveled to Cedar Point, a place that calls itself
America's Roller Coast. The Sandusky, Ohio, location is a 364-acre
amusement/theme park and resort consisting of a confusing maze of
walkways hugged on all sides by rides and money-vacuuming
indulgences.
</P>
<P>
   There are nearly 70 rides, including 14 roller coasters. This
year's big attraction is the Millennium Force, a 310-foot-tall
world-record-breaking roller coaster with a peak speed of more than
90 mph.
</P>
<P>
   The Millennium Force was high on the wish list of two in my van
load. Our group of five consisted of my 16-year-old niece and
12-year-old nephew, along with my two kids whose ages total 12. We
knew the disparity in age, size and taste would force us to
separate during the day.
</P>
<P>
   If the older kids were going to enjoy the day, we needed to get
them out of the ``Kiddy Kingdom'' and onto rides like Millennium
Force.
</P>
<P>
   A large tree close to the entrance was voted our meeting spot if
we lost track of each other. We set out together to get the lay of
the land, surrounded by people with walkie-talkies. Some also used
cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   People standing alone were having conversations using hand-held
devices. Brightly colored electronic companions kept them company
in lines, on rides and as they walked.
</P>
<P>
   We enjoyed several rides early in the day. My niece and nephew
separated from us to enjoy some long-lined rides for the
long-legged.
</P>
<P>
   While they sped through the skies aboard coasters, we stayed
closer to the ground on rides that accommodate the ``under 48''
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Each time we set a time and exact place to meet. By late in the
afternoon I was feeling a little cocky about our organizational
skills.
</P>
<P>
   I watched from the viewing area with my youngest child as the
other three soaked themselves on a water ride. We met them at the
exit and then separated quickly.
</P>
<P>
   This time my ``meet me here'' message did not come across
clearly. We lost track of each other, and I was not looking forward
to the walk back to the emergency meeting spot _ the tree at the
entrance.
</P>
<P>
   I turned on the cell phone in my pocket, although the kids did
not know the number. I took one last walk around. My nephew's
worried look was a welcome sight, and he took me to our other two
wet-and-weary travelers just as the cell phone rang.
</P>
<P>
   My niece had called my parents (collect from a pay phone), told
my mother they were lost, and asked my mother to track me the cell
phone number. It was not a bad plan, but the future plan is to buy
a set of walkie-talkies.
</P>
<P>
   These are useful tools for family trips to the mall, Disney
World or Stone Mountain Park. The casual walkie-talkies do not
require a license, unlike ham radios. There are no airtime charges
as with cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular of these fun two-way radios at Cedar Point was
the Motorola Talkabout. There are a few variations on the
palm-sized device.
</P>
<P>
   The Talkabouts are described in detail (and also available for
purchase) on the Motorola Web site (www.motorola.com). The popular
T289 radio features 14 channels, using 38 privacy codes. The T289
has a range up to two miles with fairly clear transmission.
</P>
<P>
   Kenwood (www.kenwood.net), Sony (www.sony.com), Audiovox
(www.audiovox.com), Radio Shack (www.radioshack
</P>
<P>
   .com) and Cobra (www.cobraelec.com) all make models. The radios
cost from $35 to $200 each.
</P>
<P>
   The more expensive they are, the more elaborate the features.
Some include hands-free operation, built-in weather radios and
scramble modes (for greater privacy).
</P>
<P>
   With the popularity of the devices growing and the airwaves
becoming more crowded, the most important feature is the ability to
break the channels into sub-settings. The 38 ``squelch settings''
on each channel (like the T289 features) help prevent overlap.
</P>
<P>
   The walkie-talkies operate using the Family Radio Service, the
UHF FM frequency created by the Federal Communications Commission
in 1996 for casual recreational use. The devices allow easy
communication for up to two miles but are open to interception. The
airwaves are public, and no conversation is guaranteed to be
private.
</P>
<P>
   These are certainly not the walkie-talkies of my youth. These
look like a lot more fun and might enhance the enjoyment of next
year's amusement park spin.
</P>
<P>
   Check out the review (``You're Never Too Old for 2-Way Radios'')
from AnchorDesk (May 4) at
www.zdnet.com/products/stories/reviews/0,4161,2561308,00.html.
</P>
<P>
   You can find two-way radios at many electronics retailers. You
may also want to try a shopping bot like MySimon (www.mysimon.com)
or Excite's bot (shopping.excite.com). Shopping bots, or robots,
are comparison services that give you a choice of price and
retailers with a quick Web click.

 &HT;    Drivin' movies
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The 1990s were about the embracing of electronic
devices, ranging from computers to home theater, including movies,
music and video games.
</P>
<P>
   Now many of us are taking the next step: We won't leave home
without them.
</P>
<P>
   This very summer cars, SUVs and minivans are rolling with
dashboard-mounted TVs, five-speaker DVD systems, PlayStation and
Sega equipment for video games, onboard computers for global
communication, and even plain old VCRs gussied up to play tape from
camcorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the big reasons for installing these systems is to
occupy kids during long vacation trips,'' said Justin Burns, a
mobile electronics specialist at HiFi Buys.
</P>
<P>
   Others, industry people say, are buying the fancy systems
because they enhance the feeling of luxury in prized sport-utility
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The electronic entertainment systems can cost from $500 for a
basic console with video to as much as $16,000 to $20,000 _ largely
depending on the number of TV sets installed.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Haynie, a 16-year-old, may have the fanciest 1998 GMC
Jimmy in metro Atlanta, complete with a $7,000 personal computer
system installed by a team of specialists at HiFi Buys. Justin, who
just became old enough to drive, has his system featured in car
audio trade magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justin and many others put these vehicles in competitions all
over the area,'' said Dennis Head, a mobile electronics specialist
who helped install the system. In other words, drag racing and
ear-splitting boombox rallies have given way to dueling
entertainment centers on wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Though it has reached new heights, the trend is not brand new.
Ever since Oldsmobile introduced a videocassette player for its
minivans in 1998, car stereo enthusiasts have been one-upping one
another with dazzling audio systems, and now video.
</P>
<P>
   The industry, always on the lookout for new ways to hook
motorists, has jumped onto the bandwagon, and now every major
manufacturer is offering some form of video in the car.
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent element of the new systems is the 7-inch LCD
video screens that cost $1,100 each. Some vehicles feature as many
as five of them. For example, a system could consist of one on the
dashboard, one or more overhead and others in floor-mounted
consoles, particularly in big vehicles like Chevy Suburbans.
</P>
<P>
   The video systems typically include an electronic lockout to
discourage drivers from watching movies at the dashboard level,
even though expressway jams could hold you motionless long enough
to watch an episode of ``The Young and the Restless.''
</P>
<P>
   The systems do allow the motorist to watch on-screen readouts
from the global positioning service that guides the car to
destinations.
</P>
<P>
   While many new vehicles can come equipped with many features,
others prefer customized systems.
</P>
<P>
   One of the glories of the new fad is that on long trips family
members can each do their own thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of families bring the minivans in,'' says Jason Krimm,
owner of Stereo-in-Dash in Dayton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll hook up a VCR or DVD player and a few screens with
headphones, and you don't have to hear Barney singing. All the
noise will stay in the back.''
</P>
<P>
   Youngsters take to the in-car video like ducks to water.
</P>
<P>
   ``When kids come in, they make a beeline for our mock-up vehicle
that displays the video systems,'' said Shawn Simpson, a mobile
electronics specialist for HiFi Buys.
</P>
<P>
   And he might have added that when the kids come home from a
trip, enhanced by the entertainment on wheels, many of them won't
get out of the car. Some prefer to play their games in the van or
SUV than in their rooms in the house.
</P>
<P>
   So much fun, so much excitement _ but it comes at price.
</P>
<P>
   Most systems require some type of controlling head unit for the
dashboard.
</P>
<P>
   Add a few screens and a six-disc DVD/CD changer, and you'll be
looking at about $5,000 for a Pioneer system, typical of many.
</P>
<P>
   Panasonic has a similar setup. Head unit for $2,000, DVD player
($1,200), 7-inch LCD screen ($1,100) and a Dolby processor for
surround sound ($800), all coming to about $5,100.
</P>
<P>
   While much of this is for fun, there are also elements that help
the work-minded motorist.
</P>
<P>
   There's the Clarion AutoPC, which runs on Microsoft Windows CE
software. The information superhighway can be accessed while on the
interstate with the mobile mini-computer's wireless connection _
with e-mail, stock quotes and faxed information just clicks away.
</P>
<P>
   Want to pass the time with trendy MP3 music files? Software is
on the way for the AutoPC to play your favorite downloads straight
from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Other features of this computer on wheels described at the Web
site www.autopc.com/ can include a $1,300 voice-activated
navigation system and an onboard system to monitor gas consumption
and mileage, tip off impending engine problems and more.
</P>
<P>
   Though sales are sluggish at the moment, promoters of the
computer on wheels say potentially the motorist could have a full
office on wheels.
</P>
<P>
   But bombarding a driver with so many distractions does have its
critics. Highway patrolmen don't like them at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``These video systems pose the same threat as using a cellular
phone does,'' says Sgt. Eric Widmyer of the Ohio Highway Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to include one of these systems, be sure that
all display devices are out of the driver's view. There's too much
happening on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   HOTTEST ADD-ONS
</P>
<P>
   Among the top selling add-on electronic items for cars and vans:
</P>
<P>
   1. Supplementary speakers, mostly bass subwoofers. Typical
12-inch woofer is $199.
</P>
<P>
   2. Radio upgrade, typical to high-quality radio/CD players such
as Alpine for $300 and up.
</P>
<P>
   3. Global positioning service such as the Alpine, at $1,499 to
cover the Southeast or $1,999 for the nation plus much of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   4. Radio-TV consoles for vans and sport-utilities, about $500.
</P>
<P>
   5. Seven-inch LCD video screens, about $1,100.

them out of the ``Kiddy Kingdom'' and onto rides like Millennium
Force.
</P>
<P>
   A large tree close to the entrance was voted our meeting spot if
we lost track of each other. We set out together to get the lay of
the land, surrounded by people with walkie-talkies. Some also used
cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   People standing alone were having conversations using hand-held
devices. Brightly colored electronic companions kept them company
in lines, on rides and as they walked.
</P>
<P>
   We enjoyed several rides early in the day. My niece and nephew
separated from us to enjoy some long-lined rides for the
long-legged.
</P>
<P>
   While they sped through the skies aboard coasters, we stayed
closer to the ground on rides that accommodate the ``under 48''
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Each time we set a time and exact place to meet. By late in the
afternoon I was feeling a little cocky about our organizational
skills.
</P>
<P>
   I watched from the viewing area with my youngest child as the
other three soaked themselves on a water ride. We met them at the
exit and then separated quickly.
</P>
<P>
   This time my ``meet me here'' message did not come across
clearly. We lost track of each other, and I was not looking forward
to the walk back to the emergency meeting spot _ the tree at the
entrance.
</P>
<P>
   I turned on the cell phone in my pocket, although the kids did
not know the number. I took one last walk around. My nephew's
worried look was a welcome sight, and he took me to our other two
wet-and-weary travelers just as the cell phone rang.
</P>
<P>
   My niece had called my parents (collect from a pay phone), told
my mother they were lost, and asked my mother to track me down and
tell me where they all were. She knew her grandmother knew the cell
phone number. It was not a bad plan, but the future plan is to buy
a set of walkie-talkies.
</P>
<P>
   These are useful tools for family trips to the mall, Disney
World or Stone Mountain Park. The casual walkie-talkies do not
require a license, unlike ham radios. There are no airtime charges
as with cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular of these fun two-way radios at Cedar Point was
the Motorola Talkabout. There are a few variations on the
palm-sized device.
</P>
<P>
   The Talkabouts are described in detail (and also available for
purchase) on the Motorola Web site (www.motorola.com). The popular
T289 radio features 14 channels, using 38 privacy codes. The T289
has a range up to two miles with fairly clear transmission.
</P>
<P>
   Kenwood (www.kenwood.net), Sony (www.sony.com), Audiovox
(www.audiovox.com), Radio Shack (www.radioshack
</P>
<P>
   .com) and Cobra (www.cobraelec.com) all make models. The radios
cost from $35 to $200 each.
</P>
<P>
   The more expensive they are, the more elaborate the features.
Some include hands-free operation, built-in weather radios and
scramble modes (for greater privacy).
</P>
<P>
   With the popularity of the devices growing and the airwaves
becoming more crowded, the most important feature is the ability to
break the channels into sub-settings. The 38 ``squelch settings''
on each channel (like the T289 features) help prevent overlap.
</P>
<P>
   The walkie-talkies operate using the Family Radio Service, the
UHF FM frequency created by the Federal Communications Commission
in 1996 for casual recreational use. The devices allow easy
communication for up to two miles but are open to interception. The
airwaves are public, and no conversation is guaranteed to be
private.
</P>
<P>
   These are certainly not the walkie-talkies of my youth. These
look like a lot more fun and might enhance the enjoyment of next
year's amusement park spin.
</P>
<P>
   Check out the review (``You're Never Too Old for 2-Way Radios'')
from AnchorDesk (May 4) at
www.zdnet.com/products/stories/reviews/0,4161,2561308,00.html.
</P>
<P>
   You can find two-way radios at many electronics retailers. You
may also want to try a shopping bot like MySimon (www.mysimon.com)
or Excite's bot (shopping.excite.com). Shopping bots, or robots,
are comparison services that give you a choice of price and
retailers with a quick Web click.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Learning, fun? _ hmmm . . . sounds dubious. But
Mattel Interactive's new Pokemon PokeROMs ($8;
www.pokemon.com/goods/pokeroms.html; for Mac and Windows) deliver
on this claim to a good degree as Pokemon icon Professor Oak leads
kids in activities that promote math and grammar skills. Each
session begins with a ``Concentration''-type puzzle, where math
equations and answers must be matched, each correct union revealing
part of a Pokemon. When the entire image is visible, it can be
saved or printed. The computerized board game finds up to four
players answering grammar questions to move across a virtual game
board. Difficulty can be tailored to children from grades 1 to 5,
but there are too few questions in each level and they quickly
become repetitive. The Pokemon observatory, where you search a map
for Pokemon and click hot spots to reveal them, is lackluster. Each
click seems to reveal a different shot of your Pokemon but, in
reality, only triggers a slide show that will reveal all of the
pictures if you don't click away fast enough. In spite of these
negatives, PokeROMs, available on small, mini CD-ROMs, offer a
non-violent, educational computer experience that children will
enjoy . . . for a while. Here's hoping Mattel adds new questions to
the Series 2 and 3 PokeROMs (due later this year).

   A SWING AND A HIT Hey, batter batter . . . Humongous
Entertainment has updated its Junior Sports collection with
Backyard Baseball 2001 ($20; store.humongous.com; for Mac and
Windows), an update of their best sports title, Backyard Baseball.
So what's different? Well, kids still can choose their own teams
(and team names) but in addition to the original cast of
characters, players also can choose from 31 kid versions of their
favorite big-leaguers such as Sammy Sosa and Randy Johnson
(hands-down the game's best pitcher). Also new in this version is
the option to build your own player from scratch, choosing his or
her batting, fielding, throwing and running skills. Special wacky
abilities are rewarded for outstanding play. A pitcher, for
instance, might get to throw fireballs, which actually burn on
their way to the plate. Batters might get to smack
``undergrounders'' (hits that travel under the playing field and
pop up at random spots). This game features Humongous' trademark
beautiful animation, silly humor and great play. All in all, it's
another home run.

 &HT;    Latest Windows clearly a winner
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The next version of Windows is supposed to be on the
store shelves in September, and this time it appears to be
something to get at least mildly excited about.
</P>
<P>
   Windows Millennium, which Microsoft has familiarly but
unfortunately nicknamed Windows Me, arrived through the transom
last week in its beta version.
</P>
<P>
   It installed flawlessly over Windows 98, and upon a cursory
examination, it obviously marks a new way of thinking within
Microsoft. The operating system is going the way of the desktop
computer makers _ dividing into two distinct camps, one for
business and one for home.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 2000, of course, is the all-business operating system.
Windows Millennium is the home system. Which is not to say that it
won't serve the same set of users that 95 and 98 did; certainly it
will.
</P>
<P>
   But nearly all the new stuff here is aimed at the home and
family. The thrust is toward a more stable system that requires
less expertise to maintain and fix, an integrated way of finding
help, and vastly improved digital media services.
</P>
<P>
   While the Media Player and Movie Maker are the sexy items, the
PC Health provisions are likely to be more important to more users
in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Microsoft says it has protected some 900 system
files against ``unauthorized'' rewriting or overwriting. Exactly
what constitutes ``unauthorized'' remains to be seen, but it should
be a big step in guarding against the willy-nilly damaging of these
files by someone who doesn't know what he or she is doing.
</P>
<P>
   Even better is the System Restore feature. This is the same
thing, basically, that utilities like Norton have offered for
years, with one major improvement _ it's automatic. Every day, and
every time a new program is installed, Restore makes a ``snapshot''
of the system and stores it away. If something goes haywire, you
can call up System Restore and revert to any one of aome of the
stand-alones but good enough to satisfy most folks for quite a
while.
</P>
<P>
   Audio processing has been fancied up with the addition of new
internal processors.
</P>
<P>
   I've been running the beta version for only a few days now, but
I've had little trouble with it. There seem to be some issued
involving Windows Explorer, which tends to get flaky now and then,
but those will surely be settled by September.
</P>
<P>
   I'm having another problem with a couple of programs, but I
suspect the trouble was there before I installed Windows Me.

 &HT;    Will it butter the bread, too?
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A toaster that costs almost $400 had better come
with arms and legs and be willing to do the windows, too! That will
inevitably be your initial thought about this appliance. And the
fact that the Queen of England owned the very same trinket will do
little to sway your conviction that a $400 toaster is ludicrous at
best.
</P>
<P>
   But then Williams-Sonoma Inc. takes its beautiful, gleaming
Dualit Combi Toaster ($379; www.williams-sonoma.com) and reminds
you of your old $15 appliance and the frustration of having to
shove your bagel halves into the slots, then extract their charred,
crumbled remains with a pair of tongs. The Dualit's slots are wide,
allowing you to easily toast bread, bagels or English muffins.
There's even a separate slot for toasting whole sandwiches and a
slide-out tray that catches all the crumbs. With a slot rocker
switch, timer and manual ejector knob, this toaster will require
more attention than others. Without going so far as to say it's
worth its price, let's just say that once you have the pleasure of
using the Dualit, all the other toasters are bound to be . . . well
. . . toast.

   NEW IMAC EDITION IS TRULY SPECIAL
</P>
<P>
   Bearing in mind that Apple veritably coined the phrase ``user
friendly,'' it follows that the iMac DV Special Edition (SE)
($1,500; www.apple.com) offers everyperson home computing at its
finest. Bundled with an easy yet detailed tutorial and a formidable
suite of basic computing tools (Internet browser, e-mail, desktop
publishing, graphics editing), the iMac DV SE's crowning feature is
its DVD-ROM drive and the immensely popular iMovie software, a
video editing/moviemaking application for the home movie
enthusiast. Complete with trademark ``FireWire,'' digital video
transfer hardware normally sold separately (and at notable cost)
for Windows-based PCs, the SE is a forward-thinking computer in
that it does not accommodate analog video, the more familiar
camcorder format fast on its way to becoming obsolete. iMacs are
inherently less expandable than PCs, though more adaptable in these
later incarnations. Yet with specific users and hobbyists tackling
specific home computer tasks, the iMac DV SE is just what a great
many new-to-the-modern-era folks are looking for: scaled down,
professional-caliber computing that brings the ``friendliness''
back to user-friendly personal computers. Available in snow and
graphite colors.

   AUSTIN, Texas _

   The next iteration of Microsoft's IntelliMouse line is the
IntelliMouse Optical ($55; www.microsoft.com; for PC and Mac),
complete with the trackball-less, any-surface, never-gum, supremely
accurate ``IntelliEye'' laser reader in its belly. The most
ambitious descendent yet, the USB or PS/2 mouse boasts easy
Internet interfacing with the requisite left and right buttons on
top, a combination scroll wheel and third button nestled in
between, plus a thumb and pinky button on each side insinuated as
``forward'' and ``back'' commands on a browser _ or any function
the user cares to program. A symmetrical, ergonomic device, the
side buttons also accommodate left handed users.
</P>
<P>
   A great, high-tech mouse for all, lefties included, providing
they never share their computer with a righty nor ever use a
righty's computer, in which case, all involved are going to feel
backward.

 &HT;    Spelling returns to save us from reality TV
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Rat-eating reality shows and meaty dramas are
up, thigh-slapping sitcoms are down.
</P>
<P>
   Missing entirely from the prime-time landscape, however, is the
juicy genre of the 1980s _ the adult sudser. Rich, drunk, immoral
folks like the Ewings of ``Dallas'' and the Carringtons of
``Dynasty'' were an endangered species in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Now Aaron Spelling, the granddaddy of glamorous melodrama, is
bringing back the Over-the-Top Players. If you yearn for mansions
stocked to the rafters with dysfunctional, immaculately groomed sex
maniacs, stay tuned for ``Titans,'' an NBC glossy coming in
October.
</P>
<P>
   ``Audiences love to see rich people have problems, and they love
to laugh at rich people's problems,'' Spelling said in Los Angeles
recently. ``And this show has something special: We've got a sense
of camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, so ``Dynasty'' wasn't campy? Apparently the 72-year-old
Spelling failed to catch the camp that made Alexis the most-loved
villain since J.R. Ewing. Were we really supposed to take seriously
those claw-exposed cat fights between Alexis and Krystle? It seems
impossible to believe, but Spelling insists his previous prime-time
soaps, including ``Melrose Place'' and ``Beverly Hills, 90210,''
weren't supposed to be funny. That's really scary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Titans,'' on the other hand, is an intentional romp from the
get-go. Chiseled hunk Chandler Williams (Casper Van Dien) comes
home to Beverly Hills from the Navy to find his tumultuous and
fabulously rich family a mess. His parents are divorced but live
across the street from each other in dueling mansions.
</P>
<P>
   Patriarch Richard (Perry King) is about to marry Heather
(Yasmine Bleeth), a luscious, scheming young woman who recently had
a fling with Chandler _ unbeknownst to poor, dim-witted Dad. (The
wiggle walk in the wedding dress is a comedy highlight of the
upcoming season.) Chandler still has a thing for her; Dad's sexy
assistant has a thing for Chandler. The other Williams son is
ambitious and alcohol-obsessed, a nasty combination.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the street is the serenely calm mother,
Gwen (Victoria Principal), whose two daughters are a handful. The
three women run an upscale nightclub, which turns out to be a
terrible temptation for the daughter who is an alcoholic. Heavy
drinking runs in the family.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot ends with a bomb of a plot twist. Some critics laughed
so loud they worried about hurting Spelling's feelings as he sat in
the darkened room. It's always uncomfortable when a producer sits
in on a screening, and this one was no exception. In fact, it was
excruciating knowing this soft-spoken legend, the most prolific
producer in the history of television (starting with ``Zane Gray
Theater'' and continuing through ``Charlie's Angels'' and ``The Mod
Squad''), saw us howling like hunting dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's OK,'' Spelling insisted sweetly when the lights came on.
``We want you to laugh at that last line! We're dead if you
don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps less intentionally funny, however, are the beautiful-bod
poses struck in every scene by the well-endowed Bleeth and the
abs-of-steel Van Dien. She delivers every line through pouty lips
with eyelids drooping; he can barely spit his words out because
he's so intent on flexing his jaws. These folks are a hoot.
</P>
<P>
   For those who see the ``Survivor''-inspired reality trend as
poison, ``Titans'' may be the perfect antidote. It's a live-action
cartoon. Absolutely nothing about it is real.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to do a reality show, I guess I'd do it in a house of
prostitution,'' Spelling quipped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dallas'' and ``Dynasty'' were blockbuster hits during the
Reagan era, when rich and famous were positive traits _ right up
there with family values. Spelling is counting on the dawn of the
new decade to cast a similar glow on the viewing populace. The
hectic, high-tech world we live in, he hopes, has created a
receptive mood for this glitzy escapist entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   There's more than a grain of truth in Spelling's theory that we
love to laugh at the overwrought woes of rich people. Maybe we're
jealous of the dot.com billionaires and the lottery-winning
multimillionaires, and we need to poke fun at them. We can't have
net worths as big as a European country, but at least we're not
having affairs with our parents' new spouses.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether Spelling's intentional camp will
be as tasty to the masses as the allegedly unintentional camp of
yesteryear. It's going to be hard to top Alexis guzzling champagne
for breakfast, or J.R. cheating his own mother out of an oil well.
Those were heady times for prime-time soaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Titans'' is a fast-paced romp on satin sheets. It could be
just the ticket for people tired of gritty cop shows and
peeping-tom reality. And it just might launch a new trend of
fantastic camp. A sly old fox like Spelling just might know what
he's doing.

 &HT;    STUCK IN THE MIDDLE: Seventh-graders offer sage advice to
students starting middle school
 &HT;    By Maureen Downey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The leap from elementary to middle school can be
pretty scary.
</P>
<P>
   Sixth grade plunges you into a world of lockers, changing
classes and new faces. You're caught somewhere between being a
child and being an adult.
</P>
<P>
   To help those of you beginning middle school this month, News
for Kids consulted some experts: last year's sixth-graders.
</P>
<P>
   We got lots of good advice from those at Carl G. Renfroe Middle
School in Decatur, Ga., where some sixth-grade language arts
students wrote a survival guide for students following them. Plus,
other NFK readers volunteered their experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Most listed these as challenges: making new friends while
keeping old ones, dealing with popularity and adjusting to a larger
school and more work.
</P>
<P>
   Below you'll learn how they dealt with those issues.
</P>
<P>
   F R I E N D S
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could redo one thing from sixth grade, I would have
participated more in school activities. I would have signed up for
after-school clubs or gone out and supported the football or track
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead, I came home every afternoon and checked my e-mail and
went online. It made my mother and my friends mad at me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I had spent more time with them because that would have
made sixth grade easier.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Margaret Carter, seventh grade
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I hadn't gotten involved in disputes between other
people. I try now to only get involved if there is a way I can
help. If not, then I stay out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Joanna Harbin, seventh grade
</P>
<P>
   POPULARITY
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry about being popular. When I began sixth grade, I
was nervous and shaky.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is really nothing to be afraid of.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Norman Reese, seventh grade

<P>
   ATLANTA _ George W. Bush officially became the Republican
Party's presidential nominee last week at the Republican National
Convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   In his acceptance speech, the Texas governor said he would take
advantage of good economic times to work toward ``great goals'' if
elected president in November. Bush said he wants to improve
education, cut taxes and close the divide between the rich and
poor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, who are
Democrats, wasted their chance to lead.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, the Democrats will meet to nominate Gore as their
presidential candidate. Gore is expected to announce his vice
presidential choice on Tuesday.

   HARRY POTTER ITEMS COMING

<P>
   Fans of Harry Potter may be seeing the boy wizard everywhere
this fall. Shops in the United States are hoping to get Potter
sheets, toys, furniture and even underwear on the shelves in time
for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, readers who wanted to talk to Harry or join in his
wizard games had to use their imaginations. Very little merchandise
was available. With the success of the new ``Goblet of Fire'' book
and the coming of a Potter movie next year, manufacturers are
starting to crank out all things Harry.
</P>
<P>
   The question is: Will kids jump on the Potter product craze or
just want the next book?

 &HT;    Wheels provide games an authenic feel
 &HT;    By Troy Oxford
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Racing games are as popular as ever on the video game
console.
</P>
<P>
   From ``Gran Turismo 2'' for the PlayStation to the Dreamcast hit
``Crazy Taxi,'' each platform has a plethora of titles that put you
behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   The `me, but racing game enthusiasts probably want a more
authentic feel.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, there are a couple of great racing controls available.
The Interact Concept 4 Racing Wheel and the Mad Catz MC2 Racing
Wheel offer the most natural driving experiences for the Sony
PlayStation and Sega Dreamcast.
</P>
<P>
   Both controls consist of a steering wheel, a set of optional
pedals for braking and acceleration, and vibration feedback.
Despite the similarities, there are quite a few distinguishable
features between these products.
</P>
<P>
   Although both wheels can be placed in your lap or mounted to a
flat surface with suction cups, the Mad Catz wheel offered a little
more comfort and stability with its wide contoured base with
optional straps. The narrower flat base of the Interact controller
was fine when attached to a tabletop but was a little awkward in my
lap.
</P>
<P>
   Both controls look cool and sleek as far as design, but the Mad
Catz controls seem a little lighter and less rugged than the
heavier Interact controls. For instance, the control levers of the
Interact wheel are metal but the Mad Catz levers are plastic.
</P>
<P>
   The true test, however, is control, and both wheels performed
exceptionally. The custom calibration allows you to fine-tune your
steering style. Whether your steering movements are subtle tugs or
sweeping arcs, they can be programmed into the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   One feature that Mad Catz included was a two-position shifter
attached alongside the steering wheel. This is an invaluable
addition that makes it a little more comfortable and intuitive
while controlling a vehicle with a manual transmission.
</P>
<P>
   If the idea of a steering wheel seems a little cumbersome but
you still want an alternative to the standard controller, there is
the Mad Catz Hand Held Racing Wheel for the PlayStation. Although
it looks like some sort of alien weapon, it is surprisingly
comfortable and performs well for most racing games.
</P>
<P>
   Also for the PlayStation is the JogCon by Namco. The hand-held
controller is a perfect hybrid of steering wheel and standard
controller. The vehicle movement is controlled by a motorized
steering dial in the center of the unit. If a sharp turn is handled
at an excessive speed, the wheel realistically tightens and resists
movement. It's a great device to learn how to brake properly for
turns.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the JogCon, however, is that it currently works
only with Namco's racing title ``Ridge Racer 4.'' It will be
supported by ``Ridge Racer 5'' for the PlayStation 2 this fall, but
if you don't plan to pick up either title, it may not have much
value.

 &HT;    New Dreamcast titles have promise
 &HT;    By Troy Oxford
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sega Dreamcast owners probably saved some money on
games the last few months. Besides the much sought after ``Virtua
Tennis,'' Capcom's ``Marvel vs. Capcom 2'' and the sleeper hit
``Wacky Races,'' the games of late June and July weren't that
spectacular. August, however, will be a different story.
</P>
<P>
   As the Oct. 26 launch of the PlayStation 2 draws closer, gamers
are going to see some very impressive Dreamcast titles as a prelude
to the game console competition.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the titles to look forward to this month:
</P>
<P>
   ``Seaman'' (coming Wednesday): A one-of-a-kind title from Sega,
``Seaman'' redefines the virtual pet. With the addition of a
microphone peripheral, you raise, nurture or abuse a wisecracking
fish/man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep Fighter'' (Wednesday): With various deep-sea vehicles and
interesting missions, this underwater title from Ubi Soft looks
promising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ecco the Dolphin'' (Aug. 16): Another aquatic adventure game,
``Ecco the Dolphin'' looks amazing. The undersea world, marine life
and visual effects represent some of the best graphics on the
Dreamcast yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``WWF Royal Rumble'' (Aug. 17): All of your favorite WWF
superstars clobber away in this good-looking wrestling game. With
nine possible wrestlers in the ring at once, this looks like it
will be a smackdown good time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Test Drive V-Rally'' (Aug. 23): This off-road racing title
from Infogrames looks very cool. The game features a big selection
of cars, more than 80 tracks and game play in 12 countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimate Fighting Championship'' (Aug. 30): From the
developers of ``Tony Hawk Pro Skater'' for the Dreamcast comes this
intense fighting simulator. The game features a unique fighting
system, an array of moves and beautifully crafted 3-D models.

   Tennis for all levels of playersc. 2000 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   The glory and majesty that is Sega's new sports sim, Virtua
Tennis ($40; www.sega.com; for the Dreamcast) is such that it could
elicit volumes on how fun the game is to play. But writing tomes
would mean less time to actually play this full-bodied, spectacular
game. Sega's latest stellar sports title is a graphics phenom that
is easy for beginners (controls consist of a minimum of buttons),
but challenging and rewarding for more advanced gamers. With a good
variety of courts, players and bonus games (including several
training courses reminiscent of the ``Crazy Box'' challenges in
Crazy Taxi), Virtua Tennis delivers the goods. If there's one
quibble, it's that there aren't any women players and some of more
famous players on the tennis circuit are missing. But if you can do
without the Williams sisters and Pete Sampras, this is as good as
tennis games get.
</P>
<P>
   N Gen Racing ($40; www.us.infogrames.com; for PlayStation)
brings aspects of Sony's Gran Turismo ultimate car racing game to
the sky. The object of N Gen is to win the race by A.) flying
faster than everyone else, that seems obvious, B.) picking up more
afterburners and blowing past the competition and C.) shooting down
the competition. There is nothing like a friendly race that turns
to machine guns and rockets to determine who's the best. To
progress to higher levels of competition in the game you must earn
licenses to fly higher performance aircraft. The quality of N Gen's
graphics are middle-of-the-road and the realism is . . . well, it's
not realism, but that is what keeps the game fun. You can bounce
off mountains, bridges and water and still have enough strength
left to shoot down your competition. The lower you fly, the faster
the aircraft can go, so contact with inanimate objects is
inevitable. The coolest thing the game also allows you to do is
modify your aircraft _ you can add canards, change engines and
modify the airframes to produce a plane that can handle and kick
serious tail-section. N Gen has two settings for flight-control:
Arcade and Pro. In the arcade-mode the aircraft handles simply, it
banks left and right and up and down. In Pro mode, pull out your
joy stick and hang on. The aircraft can now do anything that your
reflexes can handle; corkscrews, barrel rolls, upside down flying.
N Gen is nothing revolutionary, but it is a fun game if you like
racing, flying and the sense of speed.
</P>
<P>
   Who Wants To Be a Millionaire 2nd Edition ($40;
www.playstation.com; for the PlayStation) tries to emulate the
essence of Philbin's game show phenomenon by adding a dramatic
pregnant pause every time you select your multiple choice answer.
This is aggravating in a PlayStation game where we suffer enough
loading delays as it is. Ironically, that's the best this game has
to offer. It's trivia with Regis Philbin doing some voice work _
and most of that is just sampled from the actual show. - other than
that, tThere's almost nothing here remotely resembling a video
game: The graphic interface is sparse and cheap (you stare,
alternately, at two empty chairs, or text, or an empty set mock
up). And the capper: Questions must be answered within an allotted
time limit; unlike the show, contestants are not allowed to
reminisce about the 7th grade school teacher who taught extensively
on the subject; no hemming and hawing, no repartee with the host.
The nerve! Give me a time limit and then preprogram a pregnant
pause before telling me if my rushed answer is right or wrong?
Lame. Who thinks it's possible to be a millionaire by starting out
$40 in the hole and that much further away from being a millionaire
with nothing to show for it except for ``branded consumer who
doesn't deserve to be a millionaire'' emblazoned on their forehead?
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing quite as comforting as being on the right side
of a gun, especially when that gun happens to be an anti-tank
cannon. That's basically the premise and the entire essence of
gameplay in Wizardworks' BeachHead 2000 ($20; www.wizardworks.com;
for the PC), a lone bunkerman trying to thwart a full-on naval
assault in a WWII mock-up. A brazen game that pretty much could
have called itself ``Shooting Private Ryan,'' there's not much
depth or strategy involved here _ no cutting edge graphics, just
glorious explosions, huge kabooms and mindless, shameful catharsis
through random acts of genocide. Sickening, really, but wickedly
brainless and guilty-secret fun.

 &HT;    Futuristic space wars not captivating
 &HT;    By Yusuf Davis
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As the sequel to ``Imperium Galactica,'' ``IG2'' is an
epic, real-time strategy game that is so big it takes four CDs to
hold all the empire-building, intergalactic warfare and
interstellar game play.
</P>
<P>
   With three main story lines and numerous missions and subplots,
players have almost as many options as features in this massive
program. Each story takes several hours to play, and each provides
a different challenge and approach to the game. A number of the
missions are randomly generated, ensuring that the same game is
never played twice.
</P>
<P>
   All these intricacies and choices were lost on reviewer Jim
Wilson, 17, who said he plays a lot of different types of games on
several different platforms. He called ``IG2'' ``interesting but
not much of an attention-grabber.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got a lot of features and optional stuff, but that's
what's wrong with it,'' said Jim, who tried the game enough times
to not like it very much. ``They tried to do too many things and
didn't make any one thing all that great.''
</P>
<P>
   ``IG2'' takes place in the 26th century, when gamers control a
huge and intricate galaxy. They can discover, colonize or conquer
new planets or research and develop newer, faster spacecraft and
more powerful weapons. No matter what path gamers choose, they must
engage well-armed enemies in distant space to defend their colonies
from alien attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Though artillery battles and firefights are a mainstay of this
program, there are several subplots that test a player's skills and
strategy-forming powers, such as establishing diplomatic channels
with several weird alien races, or sending spies to infiltrate
alien governments to steal their secret technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fighting was pretty cool, and I tried to get into the
spying thing a little more, but after a while, I lost interest,''
Jim said.
</P>
<P>
   Though real-time strategy games are generally his favorite, Jim
said there was something about this game that he ``just couldn't
get into.'' He conceded that others might find it entertaining, but
he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sound and graphics are good and it has a few other good
qualities, but overall I didn't like it all that much,'' said Jim.
``If this is supposed to be an upgrade and an improvement, I'm not
sorry I missed the original.''

 &HT;    Buying a good used PC might not be a bad idea
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I bought a used car last week. I can remember years
ago when it was routine to buy a brand new car every two or three
years. It was part of the American tradition just as much as
hand-cranked ice cream and Sunday afternoons spent on the front
porch.
</P>
<P>
   I don't have a front porch anymore, most of my friends would run
in panic at the thought of cranking an ice cream freezer on a 90
degree day, and I no longer buy new cars. I'm not alone.
Reconditioned used cars are becoming more and more popular as new
car prices cross the border between foolish and insane.
</P>
<P>
   The same market shift is coming to the PC world. Buying a new
machine will no longer be the automatic first choice.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's already happening. There have been some really
important changes lately _ including a slowdown in the growth of
the new PC market.
</P>
<P>
   But, more important than that, hardware has finally outdistanced
software. In the past, you almost had to buy a new and more
powerful computer every couple of years just to run the new
software. Computer programs once grew in complexity so fast that
you needed a super PC just to run ordinary programs such as word
processors and Web browsers.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, even a 350 megahertz Pentium machine can handle almost
everything (games excluded) that a home user might want to tackle.
And a 500 megahertz machine is just about right. Given that, a used
computer is a real bargain. Besides, buying a used computer makes
even more sense than buying a used car.
</P>
<P>
   With a car, there are many parts that literally wear out.
Cylinders lose compression, normal wear and tear slowly destroys
transmissions and differentials, and even the interior of a car
slowly deteriorates. But in a computer _ other than the disk
drives, power supply, cooling fan and switches _ all the parts are
solid state electronics and, with ordinary care, these parts can
and should last for decades.
</P>
<P>
   For most novices, it's probably smart to buy from one of the
retailers that specialize in used computers. That way you will get
a warranty and also the assurance that someone has looked the
machine over to make sure that it's in good working order. (If you
know a lot about computers you will feel easy negotiating with an
individual and you'll probably get a better deal.
</P>
<P>
   But my assumption is that if you know a lot about computers, you
don't need my help in picking out a used machine).
</P>
<P>
   Here's what I would recommend for novices at the used computer
store.
</P>
<P>
   1. Find a place that has been in business for at least a year or
so. The marketplace _ long-term _ tends to filter out incompetents
and crooks.
</P>
<P>
   2. Pay close attention to the store's return and warranty
policy. And remember that _ as a practical (not legal) matter _
that only a written return and warranty policy has any value to
you. So make sure, if you buy a machine, that you leave with a
written statement not just a spoken promise.
</P>
<P>
   3. Stick to brand-name machines when you buy used. Some
off-brands are every bit as good as the name brands. But, when
buying used, it just makes sense to get the extra security of a
brand name. Besides, if you need service or advice, you are more
likely to be able to find someone who is familar with the quirks of
a well-known brand.
</P>
<P>
   4. Before you walk into the store make sure that you know the
selling price for equivalent new machines. That's the only way that
you'll be able to judge whether the price for the used machine is
fair. If, for instance, you can only save $100 or so by buying a
used PC, you're much better off with the new machine.
</P>
<P>
   5. While you may well get excellent advice at the store, it's a
good idea to get some independent help on what type of machine you
need before going in. Otherwise, you'll be in danger from a
fast-talking salesman who may try to convince you that a
too-powerful, or not-powerful-enough machine is right for you.
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, look for a good used machine with a Pentium
500 megazhertz chip or better at the used computer store at a
substantial savings over what you'd pay for a new brand-name
machine.
</P>
<P>
   If you're in the market for a PC, I think it'll be worth your
time to take a look at the used machines.

   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Amos limps into the cafe
this morning, picks up his decaf from Robin, and hobbles over to
join us. ``Looks like you're just about fit for shootin','' Cal
says to his old buddy. ``Whatsa' matter'' Lucy give you that swift
kick you been asking for?'' Amos pulls over an empty chair to rest
his leg on and sits with an obvious effort. ``I think I got a toe
nail growing in wrong.'' Benny says not to complain because at his
age he's lucky to have anything at all that's still growing.

   LANE-COLUMN _ DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Not all back-to-school
supplies are bought for kids. Myself, I bought vital equipment for
a high school parent _ a thermos bottle and a coffee mug with a
nearly spillproof plastic top. The high school's late bell will
ring at 7:20 a.m., an hour I have dedicated my life to avoiding.
For the next several years, my kids and I will be consigned to a
world designed for morning people. And a harsh world it is. (Lane,

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Q: If it is not too expensive, I would like to
get my son a replica of the Maltese Falcon, like in the movie. I
have no idea where to start looking, so you came to mind.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pam Latham
</P>
<P>
   A: How about $50? The folks at Captain Bijou,
www.captainbijou.com or (256) 837-0049, sell these actual-size
plaster, jet-black-enamel-painted replicas of the famous Bogie
prop.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it really hotter than it used to be? My husband recently
attended his 45th high school reunion in San Antonio, and we all
commented on how much hotter it seems now than it was then. Is that
possible? Or were we just younger, unaware of air conditioning, or
what?
</P>
<P>
   _ J. Keith
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, in the last 10 years, the Earth has warmed approximately
1.2 degrees, reports the National Weather Service. Stir in global
warming, increased urbanization and the human adaptation to air
conditioning and I agree, it is hotter than it used to be. Q:
Please tell me where I can purchase aluminum straws. I bought a few
of them years ago. They are very attractive, handy and dishwasher
safe.
</P>
<P>
   _ N. Roberts
</P>
<P>
   A: Restoration Hardware sells aluminum tea straws with a
spoon-shaped bottom ($2.50 each or six for $15). Prefer to stay in
the house? Order at www.restorationhardware.com or by phone at
(800) 762-1005.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am interested in writing to Queen Elizabeth II. Could you
provide an address? Also, how do you properly phrase a greeting to
her?
</P>
<P>
   _ Donna B.
</P>
<P>
   A: Those who are not personally known to the queen write to her
through channels. Address the envelope to The Right Honorable Sir
Robin Janvrin, Private Secretary to Her Majesty the Queen,
Buckingham Palace, London SW1A 1AA, England. The letter's
salutation should read ``Dear sir:'' referring to the secretary. Do
not even consider using Her Majesty or the Queen's nickname,
Lilibet. Looking for common ground? Her Majesty was an auto
mechanic and an ambulance driver in World War II, loves horses and
corgis, and has a noted disdain for helicopters, coffee and tennis.
Q: Someone gave me samples of Agnes B. Cosmetics, but I cannot find
them. Who sells Agnes B. Cosmetics?
</P>
<P>
   _ A. Moore
</P>
<P>
   A: The clothing designer's boutiques are all over the globe (New
York to Hong Kong). Order the cosmetics line from her catalog by
calling (800) 758-1337. And the B in Agnes B.? Bougeois, her
ex-husband's name.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A friend from Colorado recently asked me about the many goats
on ranches around Texas. What are they used for? Surely not just
milk?
</P>
<P>
   _ J. Keith A: Goats prosper in the climate of the Edwards
plateau, which is loaded with browse. New word? ``Browse'' is
shoots, twigs and leaves fit for animal consumption. The Lone Star
State's goat count is about 1.3 million, according to the Texas
Department of Agriculture. That's a lot of goats. Approximately
370,000 of these Angora goats are raised for mohair. Texas produces
more than 90 percent of the nation's mohair. Other goat products?
Cabrito (barbecued goat) and, yes, goat milk. Q: In light of our
water shortage, I am willing to bail the bath water to put on
thirsty shrubs and grass. Does shampoo and soap in the water hurt
the plants? Does softened water damage plants?
</P>
<P>
   _ D.B.M. A: Using bath water and even washing machine water as
part of your watering plan will not harm your lawn and shrubs,
according to the master gardeners at the Travis County Extension
Service. Of course, using biodegradable soaps is always advisable.
And the softened water? No problem. Your plants will also be
watered occasionally with rain (crossed fingers) and sprinkler
water.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Please help us settle what has become a major dispute about
which shaker _ the one with the smaller number of holes _ the salt
and pepper go in. We have different answers from everyone.
</P>
<P>
   _ Larry D.
</P>
<P>
   A: The controversy may rage on, but the Salt Institute reports
the shaker with more holes is the pepper shaker. Pepper comes in
various sizes, while salt grains are uniform. Older salt shakers
have larger holes than newer ones. The recent ``salt as medical
no-no'' movement caused manufacturers to shrink the holes somewhat.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, salt was served from an open dish called a salt
cellar. Because it was a precious commodity, these dishes were
ornate _ gold, silver or carved wood. Positioned in the middle of
the table, important guests were seated near the host, ``above the
salt.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the history behind the tradition of a woman taking
her husband's last name when she marries?
</P>
<P>
   _ P. Andrews
</P>
<P>
   A: First names were the standard until surnames, usually a
reference to a job (Weaver) or relationship (Johnson, son of John),
became necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The guru of genealogy, David Baskin at the State Archives,
reports the custom is a natural outgrowth of the old theory of
English law that a woman's personality, upon marriage, became
absorbed or merged in her husband's. ``By taking her husband's
surname the woman declared that she was joining his family, an act
tantamount to becoming his property,'' adds Baskin. Plus, it is
convenient to have one's name on property in case of ownership
disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Many women in England and the United States choose to keep their
surname (often their father's) after marriage. Since 1921, the Lucy
Stone League, named for the 1850s feminist, encouraged women to
retain their maiden names after marriage. Visit
www.lucystoneleague.org for more information.
</P>
<P>
   Q: On a recent moonlight beach walk, my girlfriend and I noticed
that the seaweed that washes up on the shore glows when touched.
Not just a dim glow, but an electrical, sparkling effect. The park
ranger confirmed that it was not our imaginations, but stated that
it was not the seaweed, but something growing on the seaweed that
was glowing; however, he didn't know what it was.
</P>
<P>
   Any ideas?
</P>
<P>
   _ T. J.
</P>
<P>
   A: Hard to tell without a sample, but Texas A&AMP;M's Bill Wardle,
associate professor of marine biology, suspects you were looking at
Cnidarians (ni-DAR-ee-uhnz). This group of animals, relatives of
corals and sea anemones, spark when agitated. Chemicals are mixed
in the animals' body and a byproduct is light. Like the firefly the
Cnidarian is bioluminescent. Your touch registered as a threat, and
this sparking is to scare predators. (Neat trick _ wish I could do
it!)

CAN'T RIDE ROUGHSHOD OVER BOOKSTORE OR FIRST AMENDMENT 
</HEADLINE>

 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His email address is
levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.)  
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   
 c.2000 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When you buy a book, you don't expect to have a law enforcement
agent searching through the store's records at some later date to
see what books you have purchased. Such an action offends America's
sense of privacy. It smacks of a police state.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, that is precisely what a drug task force in Denver wants to
do.
</P>
<P>
   They want to look through the purchase records of Denver's
Tattered Cover Book Store, one of the nation's largest independent
bookstores, to see if a suspect in a drug case purchased two books
on how to make methamphetamine. They want to tie this suspect to an
alleged meth lab.
</P>
<P>
   The books on methamphetamine are not contraband. They are legal.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone has a right to read these books without government
agents looking through their purchase records and taking down their
names. But the North Metro Task Force doesn't see it that way.
</P>
<P>
   On March 17, in trying to build a case against a suspect, law
enforcement officers first attempted to serve a subpoena on the
Tattered Cover for information regarding one of its customers. An
agent of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, who is part of
the Metro Task Force, served an administrative subpoena on the
owner of Tattered Cover, Joyce Meskis. The subpoena requested
information about books shipped to a particular customer under a
specific invoice and, further, ``information regarding any other
orders placed by this customer.''
</P>
<P>
   The attorney for Tattered Cover, Dan Recht, told the DEA agent
that the bookstore treated the records of its customers as private
and confidential _ and that the release of these records would
violate its customers' First Amendment rights.
</P>
<P>
   Recht told the DEA agent that the administrative subpoena was
insufficient and that if the DEA wanted to continue its quest for
the customer's records, the agent needed to obtain a subpoena from
a federal district court. At that point, Recht told the DEA agent,
the bookstore would file a motion to quash to subpoena. The DEA
agent, according to Recht, then told him that ``it wasn't important
to them'' and they would drop it.
</P>
<P>
   Surprise, surprise. Less than a month later, Adams County Deputy
District Attorney Fran Wasserman called Recht to say that the task
force had come to him with a request for a search warrant on the
bookstore _ to obtain, basically, the same information requested by
the subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   Informed about the First Amendment implications, Wasserman said
he would call Recht by the end of the following day.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, not happy with Wasserman's approach, the task force
went to the Denver District Attorney's Office. Task force members
didn't tell Denver Deputy District Attorney Brian Allen that they
had previously dealt with the Adams County District Attorney's
Office. Allen OK'd the search warrant and Denver County Court Judge
Celeste de Baca signed it.
</P>
<P>
   On April 5, five members of the Metro Task Force went to the
Tattered Cover with the search warrant. Fortunately, Meskis was
able to reach Recht and he immediately called Allen and told him
about the First Amendment implications of the search and about the
task force first dealing with Adams County District Attorney's
Office. Allen asked the police officers to leave the premises
without executing the search warrant. The officers agreed not to
execute the search warrant for one week.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, it is impossible to stop the execution of a search
warrant.
</P>
<P>
   The week delay, however, gave the bookstore an opportunity to
seek a temporary restraining order against the drug task force and
the execution of the warrant.
</P>
<P>
   On April 12, state district court judge Martin F. Engelhoff
issued a temporary restraining order that prohibits the execution
of the search warrant for now.
</P>
<P>
   The temporary restraining order is in effect until after the
court hears arguments in a motion for a preliminary injunction. If
the court grants the preliminary injunction, the drug task force
will not be able to serve the search warrant on the bookstore _ and
customer records will continue to be safe from police inspection.
</P>
<P>
   After several requests for delays, the new date set for the
hearing on the preliminary injunction is Oct. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Much more than customer privacy is at stake here. The First
Amendment right of a free press presupposes the fundamental right
to read. One without the other would be an empty promise. What good
is a free press if the police can intimidate you for what you read?
</P>
<P>
   In an Aug. 2 interview, bookstore owner Meskis said, ``We hope
and expect that the judge will look at this as a First Amendment
issue beyond the privacy issue. If the judge doesn't stop this
warrant, people are going to be very fearful of what they read and
buy. I think it will chill the freedom to read. One needs to be
constantly mindful that the First Amendment is one of the dearest
things in a democratic society _ the protection of the freedom to
read. It's so important.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customers have an expectation of privacy when they come
into the bookstore to purchase a book. If they feel that is
compromised, they may not read what is constitutionally protected
for them to read because of the concern that something may come up
where their records would be open to police scrutiny.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Meskis, one of Tattered Cover's customers explained
that just because he likes to read murder mysteries doesn't mean
he's a murderer.
</P>
<P>
   If controversial books can cause the police to search bookstore
records of sales to customers of those books, few will end up
buying them. As a consequence, those books will no longer be
available, because without sales publishers won't be able to afford
to publish them. When controversial ideas disappear from the public
dialogue, democracy is much, much poorer.
</P>
<P>
   The Tattered Cover should win this battle. The U.S. Supreme
Court has generally prohibited the kind of searches that implicate
the First Amendment unless the government has a compelling reason.
There is no compelling reason in this situation. The Metro Task
Force didn't even interview the suspects or try other means to tie
the particular suspect to the alleged meth lab.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary injunction hearing is being held in a state
district court. The state of Colorado has a very strong tradition
of protecting its residents' freedom of speech and freedom to read.
Some attorneys contend that the Colorado Constitution protects the
state's residents' First Amendment rights better than the federal
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   This is a case of a few misguided law enforcement officials who
thought they could ride roughshod over a legitimate business and
its customers and ignore the First Amendment implications of their
actions.
</P>
<P>
   It is fortunate that the Denver District Attorney's Office
delayed the execution of the search warrant, so that the matter
ended up in the courts where both sides and the First Amendment can
have a fair hearing.

 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Dubya jokes are over. George W. Bush is well
on his way to becoming president, on the basis of reading one
52-minute speech _ probably the most reading he's ever done at one
time in his life.
</P>
<P>
   There we go again, making fun of Bush. Liberals can make fun of
Bush's vast accomplishments in the highly competitive field of
ignorance, but it won't hurt him.
</P>
<P>
   So what if Bush once said he wasn't good at ``sitting down and
reading a 500-page book on public policy or philosophy or
something.'' Most Americans would rather have an unanesthetized
root canal than read something Gorey like that.
</P>
<P>
   So what if Bush gave Texans the right to carry concealed
handguns. When do the rest of us get ours?
</P>
<P>
   So what if Bush didn't know who Tony Blair is. Who wants to know
who Tony Blair is?
</P>
<P>
   This is America, the land where nothing can stand in the way of
a man who says his favorite movie of all time is ``Austin Powers:
The Spy Who Shagged Me.''
</P>
<P>
   What's Al Gore's favorite movie? ``White Men Can't Jump''?
``China Syndrome''?
</P>
<P>
   Right about now, Gore's image consultants are showing him tapes
of Adam Sandler movies and asking him to pick a new favorite flick.
Bush has put Gore and his handlers in a bind.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore does what comes naturally _ act smart, talk down, go for
the jugular _ he will seem even less presidential than he does now.
</P>
<P>
   But if he tries to find a new earthiness to match his new earth
tones, it'll seem like just another image make-over.
</P>
<P>
   It'll sound fake if, like Bush, he starts running on having
overcome his past. It'll sound like another Gore fib if he says he
wasted a lot of time at Harvard tooling around with his roommate
Tommy Lee Jones in an old Cadillac convertible.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, the story is true.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore's strategy for winning was right there, and he didn't
pick up on it.
</P>
<P>
   He isn't such a wonk, and he definitely wasn't by Harvard
standards. He was a regular guy who had a motorcycle and dated (and
later married) a drummer in an all-girl rock band. He roomed with a
Texan with a football scholarship who later became a famous movie
star with a mesquite accent and plenty of lines in his face, none
resembling a smirk.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore knows Texans, and George W. Bush, you were a Texan
cheerleader at Andover.
</P>
<P>
   Who's the truer regular guy, the one who's the son of a
president and didn't do any studying at Yale? Or is it the one
who's the son of a senator and did his senior thesis on the role of
television in American politics and didn't learn much from it?
</P>
<P>
   That would be a fair fight, one we'd want to see.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Bush pulled way ahead of Gore in the regular guy
department by not knowing who was president of Chechnya, however
you pronounce it and wherever the hell it is.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, Democrats thought not knowing about Chechnya
would hurt a presidential candidate. As the scion of an
aristocratic political family, Bush knows that's why presidents get
good hired help.
</P>
<P>
   Gore made the mistake of talking about foreign policy, trade and
all those topics in books Bush won't read. Gore even wrote a book
Bush (or you and I) wouldn't read.
</P>
<P>
   Lately Gore has been bragging about the economy. Even those who
find Austin Powers movies too sophisticated know there's one Al who
counts when it comes to the economy, and it's Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats completely underestimated Republicans and George W.
Bush. They complained about all the people of color put on camera
at a Republican convention filled with people of pallor.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats didn't get it. The idea wasn't to attract blacks to
the Republican Party. The idea was to make undecided white people
feel less guilty about voting Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have stolen compassion and education from the
Democrats. They made abolishing inheritance taxes a populist issue.
Now they've even pulled ahead of the Democrats in the field of
guilt.
</P>
<P>
   This is as good as a campaign promise. Never again will I make
fun of Bush or any other Republican, except maybe myself.

<P>
   &UR; BY JUDITH SHULEVITZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Could an Orthodox Jew serve as president of the United States?
The question isn't strictly Talmudic anymore _ Vice President Al
Gore has selected Sen. Joseph Lieberman to be the first Jewish vice
presidential candidate in American history.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut Democrat's presumed appeal for Gore lies in his
right-of-center politics, his religious commitment (which makes him
attractive to social conservatives), and his early condemnation of
Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky (which would help Gore
distance himself from the president's perceived moral turpitude).
</P>
<P>
   But Lieberman is also what Jews call ``Shomer Shabbas'' _ he
observes the rules that say what a Jew can and can't do between
sunset Friday night and sunset Saturday night. Among the many
things he can't do: drive or be driven, turn lights on or off, talk
on the telephone, operate anything powered by electricity, or
write.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Weekly Standard, Lieberman's embrace of these
religious restrictions would probably disqualify him from the vice
presidency. At the very least, writes reporter Matthew Rees, they
``would provoke questions about his ability to govern in the event
he became president.''
</P>
<P>
   But if there are questions, there must be answers. I called my
own rabbi, professors of Talmud at two leading Jewish universities,
and Senator Lieberman himself to find out what those questions and
answers would be.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Let's start at the beginning. Why are so many things
forbidden on the Jewish Sabbath?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Sabbath is much more important in Judaism than is
generally understood. You'd think the Sabbath would be a routine
event, coming as it does every seventh day, but the Jews consider
the Sabbath to be more sacred than any holiday except Yom Kippur,
the annual Day of Atonement.
</P>
<P>
   Also, contrary to popular belief, the Sabbath isn't entirely a
day of rest. All productivity must cease and all worldly pursuits
must be set aside, but less for one's personal restoration than for
the active contemplation of the wonders of God's creation _ the
chief wonders being, in Judaism, the family, the community, and
Torah, or the Pentateuch and its commentaries.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure that the Sabbath finds Jews in the proper frame of
mind, they are enjoined from doing or handling anything that might
distract them from the higher purpose of honoring God and all he
has made.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Given these restrictions, how has Lieberman been able to
function as a senator?
</P>
<P>
   A: In his 11 years in the U.S. Senate, Lieberman says, he has
always voted when required to do so on Friday night or Saturday,
and has also attended all emergency White House meetings held on
the Sabbath. To do this, he walks to the Capitol or White House
(which is to say, he does not accept a ride, which would be
forbidden). Luckily for him, senators vote by voice, not by pushing
a button (so that he doesn't have to operate machinery).
</P>
<P>
   Q: No matter how many technical rules he obeys, he would appear
to be violating the spirit of the Sabbath, according to which one
must refrain from work. How does he get away with it?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are two answers to this: 1) In Judaism, as opposed to,
say, Catholicism, there is no clear authority or doctrine. Jews are
left to draw their own conclusions based on their readings of
Jewish law, with help from their local rabbis. 2) In consultation
with his rabbis, Lieberman has concluded that while it would be
counter to the spirit of the Sabbath to engage in what he calls
``politics'' _ i.e., photo ops or any other kind of campaigning _
it is in keeping with the Sabbath to fulfill what he calls his
``governmental or public responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   He explains: ``You come to a point where you have to decide
whether your rigid observance of the ritual puts you in a position
of failing to uphold an ethical value that is also central to your
religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: But if he isn't observing the Sabbath as strictly as he could
be, should Senator Lieberman still be considered an Orthodox Jew?
</P>
<P>
   A: According to two professors of Talmud at Yeshiva University,
an Orthodox college, Lieberman's choice to perform his duties as a
government official on the Sabbath when he's required to do so can
be reconciled with the strictest construction of Jewish law.
Lieberman is granted an exemption from the Sabbath's enforced
idleness on the basis of two concepts: pikuach nefesh, roughly
translated from Hebrew as ``regard for human life,'' and tzorchei
tzibbur, or ``the needs of the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Under pikuach nefesh, a Jew may profane the Sabbath if human
life is at stake, as it may sometimes be in Senate legislation.
Tzorchei tzibbur says that Jews are allowed to make decisions that
affect the entire community on the Sabbath _ they just can't make
ones that affect them or their family alone.
</P>
<P>
   Everything Lieberman allows himself to do, these rabbis say, is
covered by one of those two concepts. (It should be noted that
pikuach nefesh has traditionally been understood as pertaining only
to Jewish life, but rabbinical rulings in the second half of this
century have extended it to non-Jews, mainly on the grounds that to
save only the lives of Jews under pikuach nefesh would get the
goyim so upset that Jewish lives would be put at risk.)
</P>
<P>
   Q: So, is there anything he couldn't do as vice president, or as
a vice presidential candidate?
</P>
<P>
   A: Lieberman says that, as vice president, he would balance his
duties with the demands of the Sabbath much as he has balanced them
as senator: ``I feel I've reached a conclusion on these questions
that I'm comfortable with.'' He would not campaign or perform any
other strictly political duties. He would, however, vote in the
Senate if he was needed to break a tie and he would meet with world
leaders or members of the Cabinet _ ``I'd try to schedule them some
other time, but if something needed to be done, I'd do it.''
</P>
<P>
   What if he had to travel to meet them? ``I'd try to avoid it,
but if I had to ride, I'd ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: And in the case of an emergency?
</P>
<P>
   A: Lieberman refused to speculate about anything as dire as a
president's incapacitation, but presumably he would be allowed to
do just about anything he had to under the rule of pikuach nefesh _
including being sworn in as president should anything happen to the
president and pushing the button to launch a nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What if something came up on the Sabbath which wasn't a
life-or-death emergency, but which he really ought to take care of
then and there?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yeshiva professor of Talmud J. David Bleich says Lieberman
would be allowed to delegate just about any urgent but
non-lifesaving task to a non-Jew, as long as it was also on behalf
of non-Jews. A Jew is forbidden to ask a non-Jew to do something
for him on the Sabbath that he wouldn't do for himself (in other
words, a Jew is not allowed to have a Shabbas goy, even though many
do) but ``to personally give directions to non-Jews for the benefit
of non-Jews is permissible,'' says Bleich.
</P>
<P>
   This rule would cover anything that could be construed as for
the good of American citizens, since the majority of them are not
Jewish.

   A: Lieberman refused to speculate about anything as dire as a
president's incapacitation, but presumably he would be allowed to
do just about anything he had to under the rule of pikuach nefesh _
including being sworn in as president should anything happen to the
president and pushing the button to launch a nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What if something came up on the Sabbath which wasn't a
life-or-death emergency, but which he really ought to take care of
then and there?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yeshiva professor of Talmud J. David Bleich says Lieberman
would be allowed to delegate just about any urgent but
non-lifesaving task to a non-Jew, as long as it was also on behalf
of non-Jews. A Jew is forbidden to ask a non-Jew to do something
for him on the Sabbath that he wouldn't do for himself (in other
words, a Jew is not allowed to have a Shabbas goy, even though many
do) but ``to personally give directions to non-Jews for the benefit
of non-Jews is permissible,'' says Bleich.
</P>
<P>
   This rule would cover anything that could be construed as for
the good of American citizens, since the majority of them are not
Jewish.

&HT;     `BIGFOOT' MYSTIQUE LIVES DECADES AFTER PURPORTED SIGHTINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By PETER HARTLAUB  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SIX RIVERS NATIONAL FOREST, Calif. _ Researchers trying to
legitimize the search for Bigfoot have a mortal enemy, more
fearsome than any grizzly bear or armed wilderness hermit.
</P>
<P>
   The 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Think back to comic books. Monster trucks. Lee Majors in a
polyester suit.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of giant hairy bipeds walking across the Pacific
Northwest and parts of Canada go back nearly 200 years. American
Indians in the area have passed on stories about the man-ape
creature for generations.
</P>
<P>
   But the enigmatic creature's celebrity status is relatively new.
</P>
<P>
   That fame peaked during five tacky years from 1975 to 1980, when
Bigfoot was as A-list as Burt Reynolds and Sally Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a cartoon,'' said Matt Moneymaker, president of the
Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization (BFRO). ``People used to
say, `I saw Bigfoot' like they would say, `I saw Batman.'''
</P>
<P>
   BFRO members, like others trying to collect evidence of Bigfoot,
believe their jobs would be easier if history were a little nicer
to the creature.
</P>
<P>
   The interest in Bigfoot grew again when Oregon psychologist
Matthew Johnson said he saw it in early July during a hike with his
family. Since then, the BFRO and Johnson say, a lot of people have
come forward who had been holding back their stories because they
feared ridicule.
</P>
<P>
   The name ``Bigfoot'' was first used by journalists in 1958,
after taxidermist Bob Titmus made plaster cast footprints of
creatures rumored to be wandering deep in the Six Rivers National
Forest in Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   The most famous sighting came in 1967, when Roger Patterson and
Robert Gimlin filmed 24 feet of who-knows-what walking near Bluff
Creek in Six Rivers.
</P>
<P>
   While it was debated at the time _ and still is today _ whether
that film is a hoax, journalists took a scientific approach to the
claims of Titmus and Patterson and Gimlin.
</P>
<P>
   The change occurred in the mid-1970s, when Moneymaker says
supermarket tabloids made the creature their poster boy, coming out
with ``I Had Bigfoot's Son!'' type stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``They adopted Bigfoot as a single monster and made him a
reoccurring character,'' Moneymaker said. ``Almost all these
stories were on the front page.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hollywood marketing machine took over after that, and
Bigfoot could be found everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Bigfoot fought Majors on TV's ``Six Million Dollar Man'' during
five popular episodes in 1976 and 1977. Wrestler Andre the Giant
filled the hairy costume.
</P>
<P>
   Bigfoot and the orphaned ``Wildboy'' teamed up in a live action
show that played during Saturday morning cartoons in 1978 and 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Bigfoot faced off against ``The Incredible Hulk'' in 1979,
although the end of the show revealed that Bigfoot was a hoax.
</P>
<P>
   Disneyland added Bigfoot's cousin, the Abominable Snowman, to
the Matterhorn in 1978, nearly 20 years after the bobsled ride
opened. The snowman was the only new attraction at the park that
year.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1978, the Marvel Comics ``X-Men'' introduced a
Bigfoot-like character called ``Sasquatch.'' He later became a good
guy, joining a Canada-based group of super-heroes called ``Alpha
Flight.''
</P>
<P>
   And in 1979, at a car show in Denver, construction contractor
Bob Chandler put Bigfoot's name on the side of a jacked-up pickup,
creating the first ``monster truck'' show in history.
</P>
<P>
   Moneymaker said the campy treatment of Bigfoot in the 1970s made
it harder for people to come forward with sightings. The BFRO often
hears from people who think they saw a Bigfoot in the 1970s, and
didn't tell a soul for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be branded crazy and a liar _ that's something really hard
to live with in a small town,'' Moneymaker said. ``So they keep it
secret.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two decades, Bigfoot believers with theories
grounded in science have been getting air time.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Nimoy went ``In Search Of . . .'' Bigfoot in one of the
most popular episodes of that 1980s television series, taking an
objective look at the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   An A&AMP;E cable network documentary came out in 1994, also taking a
serious look into the myth from a mostly pro-Bigfoot point of view.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary looked at Peter Byrne, a swashbuckling Indiana
Jones type who was sort of a one-man BFRO long before that
organization formed.
</P>
<P>
   Byrne's Bigfoot Research Project was actually financed for a
while by a group that supports scientific study outside of the
mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything in recent history, the Internet has made it
easy for Bigfoot believers to share stories.
</P>
<P>
   On dozens of sites, sightings and theories are exchanged in
complete anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   There are some far-out merchandise-oriented groups, but most
seem at least partly grounded in research.
</P>
<P>
   Bigfoot clubs in states such as Kansas and Ohio post regional
sightings, while the largest group appears to be the BFRO, which
has an on-line list of reports from every state except Connecticut,
Delaware, Rhode Island and Hawaii.

A TOAST TO GUINNESS, THE ULTIMATE SELFLESS STAR 
</HEADLINE>
 ALECGUINNESS KANSAS-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 ROBERT W. BUTLER  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star   Alec Guinness was the difference
between a great actor and a mere movie star.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In more than 40 films the venerated British actor, who died
Saturday at age 86, portrayed a gallery of characters as diverse as
any in the history of cinema.
</P>
<P>
   Mystics and crooks, bureaucrats and aristocrats, household
servants and even a brittle dowager. The one thing you never saw in
a Guinness movie was ... well, Alec Guinness.
</P>
<P>
   The essence of movie stardom, after all, is the performer's
ability to project an indelible sense of self. No matter what the
role, John Wayne is John Wayne. Katharine Hepburn is Katharine
Hepburn.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter if that sense of self is a sham, a facade
constructed to peddle a personality to glamour-starved consumers.
What matters is that we in the audience believe we know that
individual up on the screen. We're familiar with him or her, we
feel at home in this person's presence. We more or less know what
to expect, and that's why we pay to see them.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Alec wasn't having any of that. Here was a man whose
professional life seemed devoted to covering up any trace of
himself.
</P>
<P>
   While movie stars send the silent message ``Me! Me! Me!''
Guinness stood outside himself, diffidently observing his own
creations, seeming to say, in those bemused British tones, ``My,
my, what a curious fellow this is!''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, being a movie star is, to a great extent, about sex.
That's one reason gay and lesbian movie stars stay in the closet _
knowing the truth would ruin the fantasy life of filmgoers, who
imagine themselves in love with these beautiful people.
</P>
<P>
   But can anyone recall Guinness in a genuinely romantic role,
much less a sexy one? Either because of age or by an act of will, a
Guinness character invariably has moved beyond such trivial
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   No, as was made abundantly clear in his 1985 autobiography
Blessings in Disguise, Sir Alec was too modest, too gentle, too
nice a chap to even think of himself in such terms.
</P>
<P>
   The closest he came to actually showing off was in the 1949
comedy ``Kind Hearts and Coronets,'' in which he played all the
members of a stuffy British family. But even in that case, it was
obvious that his goal was to amuse us, not gratify himself.
</P>
<P>
   It's significant that after winning a Best Actor Oscar in 1957
for his portrayal of a by-the-book British officer in ``Bridge on
the River Kwai,'' Sir Alec almost never took the lead role in a
film.
</P>
<P>
   Instead he devoted himself to supporting parts that would allow
him to indulge his fascination with the eccentricities of human
character _ this from a man who appeared to have no eccentricities
of his own.
</P>
<P>
   And what a lot of characters he gave us! The Arab Prince Feisal
in ``Lawrence of Arabia.'' A KGB bigwig in ``Dr. Zhivago.'' Adolf
Hitler in ``The Last 10 Days.'' A bumbling blind butler in ``Murder
By Death.'' Obi-Wan Kenobi in the ``Star Wars'' series. A wry Hindu
intellectual in ``A Passage to India.'' A reprobate adventurer who
sires his own tribe of Amazon warriors in ``A Handful of Dust.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention his numerous roles on stage or his indelible
performance as spymaster George Smiley in the TV adaptations of
John le Carre's novels.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one could make a case that Alec Guinness was the finest
actor of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   We can say that now that he's gone. In life he would have been
too embarrassed to wear the crown.

<P>
   THE ORTHODOX JEW AND THE VICE PRESIDENCY, by Judith Shulevitz.
</P>
<P>
   Could an Orthodox Jew serve as president of the United States?
The question isn't strictly Talmudic anymore _ Vice President Al
Gore has selected Sen. Joseph Lieberman to be the first Jewish vice
presidential candidate in American history.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut Democrat's presumed appeal for Gore lies in his
right-of-center politics, his religious commitment (which makes him
attractive to social conservatives), and his early condemnation of
Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky (which would help Gore
distance himself from the president's perceived moral turpitude).
</P>
<P>
   But Lieberman is also what Jews call ``Shomer Shabbas'' _ he
observes the rules that say what a Jew can and can't do between
sunset Friday night and sunset Saturday night. Among the many
things he can't do: drive or be driven, turn lights on or off, talk
on the telephone, operate anything powered by electricity, or
write.
</P>
<P>
   How would such religious restrictions affect his ability to
serve as vice president?

CANCER-STRICKEN ISRAELI COMMANDOS FIGHT A NEW BATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAIFA, Israel _ Navy commando Yuval Tamir was among the best and
the brightest of Israel's warriors.
</P>
<P>
   On dangerous military missions from the Suez Canal in 1973 to
Beirut in 1982, his elite unit's commanders always vowed they would
bring him out of harm's way. And Tamir believed that.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before the skin cancer appeared as large sores on
his chest, before a different cancer appeared in tumors in his
intestines.
</P>
<P>
   That was before Tamir knew that the mouth of the Kishon River,
where it opens into the Mediterranean and where Israel's elite
commando units trained for 25 years, was contaminated with toxins
and carcinogens from nearby industries. It was before he believed
the river caused his cancer, and before he realized the military
would refuse to help pay for his expensive treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I trusted the navy. Now they have abandoned us,'' said Tamir,
42, who is dying as the two separate cancers tear away at his skin
and his intestines.
</P>
<P>
   Tamir is among some 40 Israeli Navy combat divers who are part
of a class-action suit against the government and the chemical
industry. They have contracted various cancers after training
exercises in what is regarded as Israel's most polluted waterway,
the Kishon. Twelve of them already have died.
</P>
<P>
   The case, being investigated in hearings by a high-profile
commission, has reverberated not only because of the suffering of
some of Israel's bravest veterans, but because it symbolizes a new
threat.
</P>
<P>
   This threat does not come from the hostile Arab countries that
surround Israel, but from within, from what critics say is an
irresponsible petrochemical industry and a badly flawed waste
management system.
</P>
<P>
   The Kishon River scandal has awoken Israel to what specialists
call an environmental nightmare. Environmentalists call it the
poisoning of the Promised Land, the destruction of water supplies
in a region where water is a critically limited resource.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are talking about an ecological disaster in this country,
an environmental holocaust,'' said Yehudit Naot, a parliament
member and a former deputy mayor of Haifa who is also a professor
at Technion University's faculty of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the army to treat them as though they were casualties
of war,'' he said, referring to the victims. ``To us, the army
holds the responsibility for their health.''
</P>
<P>
   The story was uncovered by Israel's leading circulation
newspaper, Yediot Ahronoth, in an investigative series that began
in May. In the aftermath, the military expressed concern, but
continued its refusal to cover the expenses incurred by the victims
of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The victims felt that a new military investigative panel was a
whitewash in the making. So Tamir, two other divers, and the widow
of a fourth sued the the government and the military last month in
the Israeli Supreme Court, alleging that authorities were blocking
an independent inquiry into Kishon pollution. They alleged that the
government had stacked the board of inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Tamir and the other plaintiffs won the case, and a new panel was
named, chaired by former Supreme Court chief justice Meir Shamgar,
who led the government's investigation into the 1994 assassination
of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the commission began work, examining the medical
status of hundreds of naval commandos in various units who dove in
the Kishon from the 1950s through the early 1990s. In addition, the
panel will be investigating industrial pollution and specifically
whether there may have been radioactive material dumped.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Yonah Amitai, a Health Ministry researcher and president of
the Israeli Society of Toxicology, says no direct link between the
Kishon's toxins and the divers' cancers has been determined. Any
link would be determined after the examination of the individual
cases, including family medical histories and other possible
environmental conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Tamir stood on the banks of the Kishon near Haifa.
The river was a bright green. The banks were set against a backdrop
of chrome stacks and processing tanks at the chemical plant.
</P>
<P>
   A 20-inch-wide pipe was spewing refuse from the chemical
industry on one side, and a 40-inch main was releasing raw sewage
on the other side. The smell was intolerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dove here, just a kilometer downriver in the bay,'' he
said, describing how, twice a week from 1976 to 1986, he was
assigned to spend up to four hours diving there.
</P>
<P>
   As a disciplinary action, his senior officers sometimes made the
divers fill up their fins and drink the river water.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it was bad, but orders were orders,'' he said. ``We
were in danger all the time. The attitude was, `Who's afraid of
some chemicals?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Kishon River is a roughly 5-mile-long estuary in northern
Israel that empties into Haifa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only river not polluted in Israel is the Jordan, and
that's because it was closed for military use for decades,''
parliament member Naot said. ``I would say Israel is 20 years
behind America and Europe in environmental policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The pollution levels in the Kishon were well known. Some naval
officials reported vomiting and diarrhea among sailors training
there as early as 1980. The navy's chief medical officer stopped
basic training there after those complaints.
</P>
<P>
   But the newspaper investigation uncovered evidence and testimony
that the commandos kept training there until the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   At this time, environmental activists from Greenpeace began a
fight in to stop Haifa Chemicals, the largest corporation dumping
toxins, from building an underground pipeline that would increase
dumping into Haifa Bay. In 1995, Greenpeace succeeded in blocking
the pipeline. And the Ministry of the Environment stepped in to
establish a timetable. The factory had five years to treat its
effluents before dumping.
</P>
<P>
   Greenpeace says it believes Haifa Chemicals will stand by its
agreement, but for now the dumping continues unabated and
surrounding factories have no environmental enforcement that stops
them from dumping raw chemical effluents into the river.
</P>
<P>
   Tamir's fight against this pollution is not stopping with the
demand for an independent inquiry. Tamir is spearheading what
promises to be a long legal battle against the military
establishment, the government, and the chemical industries that
polluted the Kishon.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental and medical experts for the class-action suit are
finding what they believe are cancer clusters in the Israeli Coast
Guard and in the commercial fishing industry that operates out of
Haifa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Irit Levine, 49, knows the dangers of the Kishon. She believes
it killed her husband of nearly 30 years, Rafi. He joined the
commandos in 1968 and was part of the elite ``Flotilla 13,'' the
Israeli equivalent to the US Navy SEALS.
</P>
<P>
   In the Levine home in Hertzliya, just north of Tel Aviv, she
showed black-and-white photographs of Rafi in his sleek black
wetsuit. He looked tall and handsome and powerful.
</P>
<P>
   The photos were from 1974, just a year after his unit fought
Egypt in the battle of the Suez Canal. He was a decorated war hero
and his life and his identity were bound in his service as a
commando. Even after he retired in 1979, he stayed on active
reserve duty. And he worked as a salesman for a diving equipment
contractor with the Israeli Navy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, he was diagnosed with a brain tumor. He spent years in
chemotherapy and different courses of radiation.
</P>
<P>
   He fought the battle like any warrior. And like a good commando
he even strategized against his enemy. He kept a log on blue
notebook paper that detailed his symptoms and that tracked this
deadly invader. Irit pointed to a Jan. 5, 1999, entry in Rafi's
diary:
</P>
<P>
   ``Speech is difficult. Tired. Very tired. Reasons? Kishon River
diving.''
</P>
<P>
   Just days before his death, his wife says, he had realized what
medical experts for their case say is obvious about the effects of
diving in the Kishon. He left three children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rafi was a fighter. I am not a fighter,'' said Irit. ``But I
feel like he is empowering me.''
</P>
<P>
   Irit has testified before parliament and has become a leader in
the fight against the chemical companies, the government, and the
navy.
</P>
<P>
   While she glanced fondly at a 1980s portrait of Rafi looking
confidently at the camera, she could not stand to see the later
photos. The chemotherapy made him bald, and steroid treatments made
him bloated. In the end, it was hard to recognize him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't look at him like that. I want to remember him
like this,'' she said, holding up the old photo of him smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Yuval Tamir is still up against the agony.
</P>
<P>
   Like Rafi, Tamir's life was the sea. He named his son Gal, the
Hebrew word for ``wave.'' Now Gal is 18 and has joined the Israeli
Navy. It was a dream of Tamir's to see his son join up. But now it
is a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what they are dumping there,'' Tamir said. ``And I know
I don't want my son in that water, or anyone else I love.''

EXHIBIT SHOWS SAINT'S HEAD, FAITH'S REVIVAL

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Antonida Likhacheva made a two-hour journey by train
from a village called Voskresensk, Russian for Resurrection, for
just one reason: to see St. Panteleimon's head.
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't alone. Over the past week, tens of thousands of
Russians have lined up around the clock outside Moscow's Christ the
Savior Cathedral to view the remains of a Christian martyr
venerated by the Orthodox as ``The Healer.''
</P>
<P>
   People came in buses, on the subway, by car, and on foot. Young
and old, rich and poor, they stood in line for as long as 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Some held prayer books and icons and prayed quietly. Some passed
the time chatting on mobile phones. Some sang hymns. And some, on
crutches and in wheelchairs, hoped for a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   St. Panteleimon's remains, which have been touring Russia and
Ukraine on loan from a monastery in Greece, are revered by the
Russian Orthodox Church as holy relics and are believed to possess
healing powers.
</P>
<P>
   A 75-year-old woman, who gave only her first name, Yevgenia,
said she hoped the saint's remains would help her failing eyesight
and cure her bronchitis.
</P>
<P>
   In a driving rainstorm, the line of worshipers snaked for miles
around the cathedral, down a side street and along the embankment
of the Moscow River near the Kremlin. As police in gray raincoats
patrolled the area, vendors sold soft drinks and snacks, and
priests in black cassocks solicited donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let it rain,'' Likhacheva, 64, said with a smile. ``Let
anything happen. We will gladly wait in line as long as it takes.
It is not like we are waiting in line for bread. Here there is hope
for life and health.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Panteleimon was born Pantoleonta in AD 284 in the city of
Nicomedia, today Izmit, Turkey, to a Christian mother and a pagan
father. Trained as a physician, he is said to have used both
medical knowledge and prayer to heal the sick. He was tortured and
beheaded by Roman authorities, by various accounts, in either AD
304 or 305.
</P>
<P>
   According to church histories, St. Panteleimon _ which means
``all-merciful'' in Greek _ cured a man of blindness and saved a
boy who had been bitten by a poisonous snake.
</P>
<P>
   Initial attempts by the Romans to torture him to death,
according to legend, proved unsuccessful. When he was placed in a
kettle of boiling tar, the tar cooled; when he was thrown into the
sea tied to a boulder, he floated; when he was thrown to the lions,
they licked his feet; and when soldiers tried to behead him, their
swords crumbled.
</P>
<P>
   The massive turnout to view his remains, in a country that was
officially atheist just a decade ago, spoke volumes about the
revival of religion here.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few of blocks away, the mausoleum housing the remains of
Vladimir Lenin, which once drew thousands of visitors every day,
stood deserted.
</P>
<P>
   Today, about 60 percent of Russians call themselves Orthodox
Christians.
</P>
<P>
   The display of St. Panteleimon's relics had been announced for
weeks in Orthodox churches throughout Moscow and its suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The veneration of holy relics, although it still exists in
Western Christianity, has eroded over the past couple of centuries.
In Orthodox Christianity it is still very strong,'' said Andrei
Zolotov, a Moscow-based journalist who writes extensively about
religion.
</P>
<P>
   Zolotov said that the massive crowds who came to view the
remains were indicative not only of increasing openness about their
religion among longtime believers, but also of the high number of
converts.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tendency among recent converts, people who recently
discovered Orthodox Christianity, is a great desire for miracles,''
Zolotov said.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Moscow, St. Panteleimon's head had been displayed in
St. Petersburg and in Kiev. Sunday, after a ceremony presided over
by Patriarch Alexy II, head of the Russian Orthodox Church, the
remains were flown back to the Monastery of St. Panteleimon in
Mount Athos, Greece.

VERNON REID GETS `SERIOUS' AT NEWPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The JVC Jazz Festival-Newport kicks off this year with a pair of
elegant old-timers, Bobby Short and Dave Brubeck, performing at
Friday night's opening festivities at the Newport Casino. The
festival's following two days, however, run the gamut of styles
from traditional to contemporary, with _ happily _ a handful of
things in between.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, artists as diverse as fusion supergroup Fourplay
(Bob James, Nathan East, Harvey Mason, and Larry Carlton), Nigerian
Afro-beat star Femi Kuti &AMP; Positive Force, and saxophonist (and
Miles Davis protege) Kenny Garrett appear on the Fort stage.
Sunday, the lineup spans the spectrum from eclectic vocalist
Cassandra Wilson to avant-garde composer John Zorn with his group
Masada to smooth-jazz titans Boney James and Rick Braun.
</P>
<P>
   New this year is an invitation-only symposium before the
festival proper, as well as a second Harbor stage at Fort Adams
State Park, the festival site, to showcase less bankable artists
during the weekend afternoons.
</P>
<P>
   It's there on the smaller stage that you'll find Vernon Reid
performing on Sunday. Rock fans know Reid as the founder and
guitarist of the alternative-metal band Living Colour, an all-black
quartet that helped upend the stereotype of hard rock as the domain
of white men. Reid considers Jimi Hendrix his predecessor and Lenny
Kravitz a disciple.
</P>
<P>
   Those more familiar with the experimental fringes, however,
remember Reid's early days playing in the New York underground
scene with Ronald Shannon Jackson's Decoding Society (which
appeared at the Newport festival in 1984), Defunkt, and Bill
Frisell, among others. Reid is, in fact, a dedicated eclectic. His
various projects have involved jazz, punk, hip-hop, electronica,
and funk, often simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Reid is a dazzling guitar technician, but more than that he's a
musical adventurer. Case in point is his 1996 solo debut,
``Mistaken Identity,'' which featured a core band composed of
clarinet (the ever-intriguing Don Byron), turntable, bass, drums,
and a keyboard invention called the Samchillian Tip Tip Tip
CheeePeeeee _ which Reid says is even stranger-sounding than its
name. Guest performers on the album, produced by Teo Mecero,
included rappers, a poet, and the actor Laurence Fishburne. Reid
plans to play material from ``Mistaken Identity'' at Newport.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I made that album, in the aftermath of Living Colour, I
was really questioning who I had become, and also who I could
become,'' says Reid on the phone from New York. ``I still consider
myself a rock artist, because I think rock is expandable. It's
Slipknot but it's also Steely Dan. It's Soft Machine and Fats
Domino. The double-edged sword is we're just designed to
categorize, and there are those of us who don't really take to it.
I just play.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, the year after he formed Living Colour, Reid and
journalist Greg Tate formed the Black Rock Coalition, an
organization dedicated to opening doors for black musicians who
weren't soul crooners or rappers. ``Basically the clubs weren't
booking my band, record labels weren't listening, so in the
beginning it was really me asking, `Hey, am I alone?' '' Reid
recalls. ``Greg and I used to just meet all the time and talk about
these things. Then one day he said, `What are we going to do about
it?' The mission became community, the survival of community.
Liberation can't be limited to one race.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid went on to record four albums with Living Colour _ 1998's
Grammy-winning ``Vivid'' produced the smash hit ``Cult of
Personality'' _ before disbanding in 1995. Pioneering as that group
was, Reid is adamant about pushing the edges of the stylistic
envelope furthur. Jazz, Reid says, is a key part of that process on
a number of levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came in with the so-called avant-garde, the kind that
reexamines the structural forms of music as well as dialogues with
society,'' Reid explains. ``Spend any time with Ornette (Coleman)
and you realize he's not just a seminal improvisor but a seminal
thinker. I don't know how serious a jazz musician I am. I seriously
love it. It's been a big influence.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid has also begun thinking seriously about a political cause.
Outraged by the forced amputation of hands by terrorists in Sierra
Leone, Reid is hoping to organize a festival of percussion to
benefit the victims. ``The drum is the preeminent instrument of
African music, and this act of mutilation is so counter to the
spirit of the drums. A fitting reaction would be to use percussion
to help them.'' Reid invites anyone interested in helping out to
email him at optivern(at)aol.com.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Reid is putting together yet another rock band, with
``Mistaken Identity'' collaborator DJ Logic. They've done a few
gigs, but are still trying to find the right vocalist. ``A lot of
this is in flux. But the music is calling me again,'' says Reid.
``The possibilites are still endless.''

GETTING TO THE HEART OF THE `REAL' CHARLES MINGUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
MYSELF WHEN I AM REAL 
The Life and Music of Charles Mingus 
By Gene Santoro 
Oxford University Press, 452 pp., $30 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although it lasted only 56 years, Charles Mingus's was a life
lived in full. The bass virtuoso and composer was bedeviled by
racism, and fought fearlessly against injustice in any form. He was
a man of prodigious appetites, for everything from food to ideas to
women, four of whom he married. Mingus hung out with musicians, but
he also counted among his friends and acquaintances Orson Welles,
Allan Ginsberg, and Jackson Pollock. He could be charming or
callous, brilliant or belligerent. He considered himself a race
man, but seemed to favor the company of white women; he abhorred
drugs and addicts, but popped pills for much of his life. A man
guided by angels and demons, Mingus had an insatiable curiosity for
everything that crossed his path.
</P>
<P>
   But more than anything, there was his music.
</P>
<P>
   From the melancholy ``Goodbye Pork Pie Hat,'' his tribute to
Lester Young, to the frenzied joy of ``Better Get Hit in Yo'
Soul,'' he created some of the most challenging and glorious
compositions in the jazz canon. He played with the greatest
musicians of his time, including Duke Ellington, Charlie Parker,
Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, and Bud Powell. Mingus approached
the bass as a vital, primary instrument _ and he played it as if
he'd invented it, caressing it like a lover, or slapping it like
somebody who owed him money. More than 20 years after his death
from Lou Gehrig's disease, Mingus still looms as one of the great
figures of American music, the unruly Spirit of jazz's Holy Trinity
alongside Ellington and Louis Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, Mingus is too much man to fit between the covers of
a book _ which is not to say Gene Santoro's unconventional but
meticulously researched biography is a failure. In fact, ``Myself
When I Am Real'' is a deliciously entertaining examination not only
of jazz's ``angry man'' and his music, but of the times in which
both flourished. In this, the first Mingus biography in 17 years,
Santoro casts Mingus as a central character in the restless drama
of a postwar America wrestling to find its identity politically,
socially, and artistically. Santoro places Mingus ``in his special
moment in American history's flow,'' as the New York Daily News
music critic writes in his introduction. His goal, he says, was to
``capture how a fragile, fertile network of real people and places
and a lifetime of encounters and events allowed Mingus to be Mingus
_ which is to to say, one of the most important composers, pivotal
artistic figures, and magnetic characters from the wild renaissance
explosion of talented oddballs who rumbled across the arts in
post-World War II United States.'' And mostly, Santoro succeeds.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Nogales, Ariz., in 1922, Mingus was raised in the Watts
section of Los Angeles by his biracial father and stepmother. His
birth mother died when he was less than six months old _ a loss
from which he would never fully recover, and one which fueled a
lifetime craving for female attention. His father was a strict
former Army sergeant who insisted his children study classical
music. Young Charles's first instrument was a trombone, but he soon
traded it for a cello. He would turn to the bass at 14, when an
older musician told him that a classical-music career as a cellist
was off-limits to a black man, but playing bass would always enable
him to make a living in jazz.
</P>
<P>
   He gave himself wholly to the bass, playing 17 hours a day. The
instrument was more than a ticket out of Watts; it gave Mingus his
own creative language. He took lessons from Red Callendar; he
absorbed the music of Ellington and pianist Art Tatum, as well as
Bach and Beethoven. He viewed jazz as music without limitation, one
which could borrow from any form from gospel to Colombian cumbias.
As his notoriety in the LA music scene grew, so did Mingus's
healthy ego. By his early 20s, he was calling himself ``Baron''
Mingus to align himself with jazz royalty _ Duke Ellington, Count
Basie, and King Oliver.
</P>
<P>
   As Mingus's story unfolds, Santoro keeps the backbeat with
perspectives on the socio-political churnings of those years, all
of which affected Mingus's life and music. Occasionally, his
juxtapositions can be as jarring as an off-note _ in the middle of
discussing a Mingus collaboration with poet Langston Hughes, he
tosses in a single-line mention of an early assassination attempt
on Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. That's on page 138, and King's name
doesn't pop up again until page 165.
</P>
<P>
   But usually, Santoro is on-target, and his writing often soars.
He clearly loves his subject, but doesn't shy from Mingus's
moodiness and misbehaviors. If Mingus wasn't all devil, Santoro
doesn't make him a saint. Instead, he makes him a man in full who
was not only influenced by the times, but left an indelible mark on
the latter half of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Creativity isn't necessarily straightforward in its dealings
with the world,'' Santoro writes. ``To put it another way, no one
has ever convinced me that the geniuses who have the lasting human
touch we call art are either monsters or role models, or even that
they should be. Shamans don't have to be horrible or nice. They
just have to work effectively in their surroundings, (and) account
for some of the planet's mysteries in ways the people they live
among can understand.''

THE ENGLISH 
A Portrait of a People 
By Jeremy Paxman. Overlook. 309 pp. $29.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jeremy Paxman, the host of BBC's ``Newsnight'' current-affairs
program, is the most feared interrogator on British television, a
Ted Koppel with attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Paxman once famously asked an evasive Tory Cabinet minister the
same question 12 consecutive times on live TV. In his provocative
contemplation on his own people, ``The English,'' he asks with
characteristic persistence, ``Who are we?''
</P>
<P>
   Paxman writes: ``The end of empire, the cracks opening in the
so-called United Kingdom, the pressures for the English to plunge
into Europe, and the uncontrollability of international businessset
me wondering. What did it mean to be English?''
</P>
<P>
   Those who subscribe to the misty-eyed view that England is a
place of warm beer, dog lovers, and cricket on the village green
might not like the answers Paxman supplies. Michael Howard, the
unfortunate Tory minister whose refusal to answer a simple question
earned him a dubious place in British TV history, would probably be
among those who consider Paxman part of that chablis-swigging,
sushi-chomping clique of self-loathing Englishmen at the BBC who
hate the queen almost as much as they hate themselves and the
masters who beat them at boarding school.
</P>
<P>
   But Paxman's search for the soul of the English recognizes his
country's virtues as often as its foibles. After all, the English
gave the world the most utilitarian language on the planet,
parliamentary and legal systems so enviable that even those who
rebelled against the British empire retained them, and Shakespeare
and the Beatles _ not to mention soccer and cricket.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Paxman does not shrink from telling the English what they
don't want to hear. That British empire on which the sun never set
is dead and gone, and now the English _ the dominant group of those
who make up Britons _ are living in shadow, trying to find an
identity that used to be taken for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being English used to be so easy,'' Paxman observes. ``They
were one of the most easily identified peoples on earth, recognized
by their language, their manners, their clothes and the fact that
they drank tea by the bucketload.''
</P>
<P>
   But now, he concludes, ``the conventions that defined the
English are dead and the country's ambassadors are more likely to
be singers or writers than diplomats or politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   He exposes the myths that have led to the English suffering an
identity crisis even as those they once lorded over _ the Irish,
the Scots, and the Welsh _ are experiencing unprecedented bursts of
confidence, creativity, and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Paxman's most evocative chapter examines the greatest myth: Why,
in a nation where about 90 percent of the population lives in urban
areas, is there such a visceral, absurdly disproportionate
attachment to the countryside? He lays much of the blame at the
foot of one of England's greatest resources, its writers.
Wordsworth and A. E. Housman, Blake and H. V. Morton, J. B.
Priestley, Agatha Christie, John Betjeman, even George Orwell,
whose ``old maids cycling to holy communion through the morning
mist'' description of England was borrowed by the Conservative
prime minister John Major as recently as 1993, are all guilty of
perpetuating an image of bucolic, rural England that bears no
resemblance to reality, Paxman contends. Contemporary writers like
Martin Amis may pen authentic metropolitan-based novels, but it's
the historical novels set in the countryside that sell by the
bucketload, Paxman says.
</P>
<P>
   Originally published in Britain in 1998, the book has only
gained currency in the two years that have passed until the
American edition, making Paxman's observations seem all that more
prescient. The creation of home-rule parliaments in Belfast,
Edinburgh, and Cardiff has not only decentralized power but added
to the Englishman's angst. The battle over the English countryside,
best exemplified by the debate over outlawing fox hunts, has grown
only more divisive.
</P>
<P>
   Paxman casts a cold eye on the English, pulling no punches with
those who throw sucker punches. He finds English soccer hooligans
reprehensible, and has no time for those who suggest their violent
bigotry is a function of repressed nationalism. But he also tries
to explain their idiosyncrasies, which others often take as
rudeness or arrogance.
</P>
<P>
   Having lived in Dublin before we moved to London, my wife and I
were stunned by the difference between the Irish, who think nothing
of inviting a new acquaintance to their home, and the English, who
are far more reticent. Paxman has an explanation for what he calls
``this curious reluctance to engage with one another.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What the English see as no more than respect for privacy looks
to others like disdain,'' Paxman writes. ``It is one of the
defining characteristics of the English; foreigners are forever
complaining about it. . . . Even foreigners sent to work in the
country can find that the only time their English colleagues invite
them into their homes is on the eve of their departure.''
</P>
<P>
   The English love nothing more than a backyard, which they call a
garden, with a high fence. But they socialize most often in pubs or
restaurants, Paxman says, not at home. ``In much of continental
Europe, you live on the street. It is the place where you eat,
drink, commiserate, flirt, laugh and pass the time of day. The
English answer to the street is the back garden, in which
socializing is by invitation only.''
</P>
<P>
   Paxman occupies a position of influence in British television
not unlike that occupied in American broadcasting by another
anchorman who made good on the book circuit, Tom Brokaw. While
Brokaw's homage to the American generation who lived through the
Depression and fought World War II is a good and honorable piece of
work, Paxman's book has far more edge and is a more important book
because it dares to examine what's wrong with the English. It is an
eminently frank, readable elucidation _ which, incidentally, is the
kind of word Paxman throws at BBC viewers around 11 p.m. on
weeknights.
</P>
<P>
   And while the old men sipping gin and tonics at the Marylebone
Cricket Club (who last year were forced to accept women as members)
might disagree, Jeremy Paxman's love of England shines through this
book. His criticism is constructive, not gratuitous, and it is
dispensed with the conviction that once shown the errors of their
ways, the English can admit it, learn from it, and move on, the
better for it.

YOUNG COUPLE NEED TO SAVE MORE TO RETIRE EARLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. We have no children, but would like to start a family soon.
We expect college tuition and other child expenses to increase the
amount of money that leaves our hands each month. I want to retire
at 35, and my husband wants to retire by 50. Can we retire at these
young ages and still have a good retirement? I keep telling my
husband we need to save more money; he says we are young and don't
have to worry, that we have more savings than any of our friends.
</P>
<P>
   S.S., Orange, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. My first instinct was to make some smart remark about
California Dreaming. But when I worked the numbers, they came out a
lot closer than I thought they would. Still, I don't think the plan
is workable. Here's how the numbers add up:
</P>
<P>
   After seven years, and presuming 10 percent average annual
portfolio growth, your own accounts would grow to $674,836. If you
project your husband's current balance and contributions to yours,
the combined pool would be $1,051,706. (These calculations do not
include the effect of any funds that might be added to your
profit-sharing plans by your employers.)
</P>
<P>
   Let's assume you leave your money intact for the next nine
years, and that your husband continues to save at the current
level. You'd have a combined balance of $2,460,197 by the time your
husband is 50.
</P>
<P>
   That sounds impressive, but now for the bad news: If inflation
averages 3.5 percent for those 16 years, you'd have the buying
power of about $1.3 million in today's money. And if you were to
put about a third of your money aside _ to protect you against the
many years of inflation during your retirement _ you could probably
expect to have a joint income of about $55,000 in retirement. That,
of course, is a far cry from the $170,000 you earn now, and even
from the $128,500 you are living on.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, during the first eight years of retirement, your
family income stream would drop from that $128,500 to $99,500,
which might be tough, in view of the substantial cost of raising
children. (If you were to have the children soon, they would likely
be entering college just after your husband retired.)
</P>
<P>
   So in the end, you are both right. You're right that you should
worry about your money. Your husband is right that you're both
young, and if you keep saving as you are, everything will work out
fine.
</P>
<P>
   Just to show you how I am thinking, I calculated the growth of
your joint portfolio if you both work for 16 years _ until your
husband is 50 and you are 44. If you save at current levels, you
would have $3,033,643. And if you raise your savings levels as your
incomes increase, and add in contributions to your profit-sharing
plans, the sum would doubtless be a lot more. I think such a plan
is a lot more realistic than what you propose. Because of its
complexity, I left out details of your portfolio. It's fine _ the
problem is that if you retire in seven years, you are simply asking
it to do more than is realistic.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have been saving for my grandson's college education. I add
odd amounts to the Proctor and Gamble account as Christmas and
birthday gifts. I add $50 a month to the Stein Roe fund, and $150 a
month to the Schwab Market Track Growth account. Am I missing
something with my strategy?
</P>
<P>
   J.K., Charleston, S.C. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You're doing pretty well, although I'd make a few changes. If
you keep up your $200 monthly contributions for 11 years, your
grandson would have $88,319 at age 17, assuming overall portfolio
returns of 10 percent a year. And that doesn't reflect the effect
of your Christmas and birthday contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Of the accumulation projected above, $51,430 would be in the
account in your name, so your grandson's eligibility for financial
assistance would not be dramatically affected. (Of course, it would
have been better if you had put the dough in your own name right
from the start.) If you were to put all future contributions in
your own name, $63,372 of the pool would be invisible on the
applications for financial aid.
</P>
<P>
   As for the particular investments, if I were adding $50 a month
to one of the custodial accounts, I would certainly choose
Firsthand Technology Leaders over Stein Roe Young Investors. Yes,
the technology fund has much higher risk, but over 11 years you can
also expect it to deliver much bigger returns (although the
dazzling 152.6 percent gain of last year is probably something you
won't see again in the near future). As for Stein Roe Young
Investor, I focused a large part of a previous column on this fund,
about which I am less enthusiastic than I used to be. (I prefer a
straight S&AMP;P 500 Index fund.)
</P>
<P>
   But those are minor changes, and you should bear in mind that
shifting from Stein Roe Young Investors or an S&AMP;P 500 fund to
Firsthand raises the overall risk. In all likelihood, you should do
quite nicely if you just keep doing as you are doing. Diverting
that $50 a month to an account in your name is probably more
important than changing the portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Money musings: About a month ago, I noted the rise of the
Vanguard Index 500 fund to the head of the list of the world's
mutual funds, at least based on total assets under management. It
passed the legendary Fidelity Magellan fund, a development that was
far from surprising, since Magellan had been closed to new
investors for some time.
</P>
<P>
   Then a funny thing happened. Index 500 failed to pull away. In
recent weeks, Magellan has been getting closer and closer to
regaining the top spot. Entering last week, Index 500 had $105,583
million under management, while Magellan was right behind, at
$104,718 million. And the records show that if investors are
turning to Magellan instead of to Index 500, they are following the
numbers: Magellan had a year-to-date loss of 1.6 percent entering
last week, verrsus a loss of 2.7 percent for Index 500.
</P>
<P>
   In my mind, this is not the kind of mindless statistic such as
those that preoccupy diehard baseball fans. Many market followers
have been predicting for years that the worm would turn, and that
in a choppy market such as we are currently enjoying, well-managed
funds would once again show they can outperform the indexers.
</P>
<P>
   The trend of managed funds beating the indexes shows across the
entire large-cap universe.
</P>
<P>
   Index 500's 2.7 percent loss compares to a loss of 0.7 percent
for the median large-cap blend fund. In the large-cap growth
sector, Vanguard Index Growth showed a 2.8 percent loss, compared
to a median loss of 0.3 percent for its peers. Only Vanguard Index
Value was close to the median, losing 2.7 percent compared to a 2.6
percent median loss for large-cap value funds.
</P>
<P>
   If you want more evidence the indexers fear the heyday of the
index funds may be coming to an end, in the same issue of The New
York Times in which I found these fascinating stats, there appeared
a letter to the business editors from John C. Bogle, founder of the
Vanguard Group and generally considered the father of the index
fund. He was complaining that the Times had discontinued a feature
comparing the results of five market advisers with the market at
large, represented by the Vanguard Index 500 fund.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, Bogle was able to show the index came out on
top, with its growth from $50,000 to $188,750 (during the
seven-year period covered by the newspaper feature) beating the
next-best performance, growth from $50,000 to $155,000.
</P>
<P>
   Let the race continue. This is the best way to drum home the
real message, the challenges and frustrations that even experts
face when managing fund portfolios to outpace an unmanaged index,
Bogle wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But I wonder whether some of his passion might be caused by the
end of the across-the-board market boom that served index funds so
well, and the return of a stock-picker's market. Stay tuned.

DISTRUST SIMMERS AS L.A. BRACES FOR DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Post-Philadelphia, pre-Los Angeles, the paranoia
is already apparent.
</P>
<P>
   One protest organizer refuses to disclose his Los Angeles
location over the telephone, fearful that the call is being
monitored. A local police official declines to discuss specific
security arrangements, unwilling to tip his department's hand.
Protest leaders contend that undercover officers have infiltrated
the building that houses their headquarters. Police in riot gear
turn out on Thursday to quell a loud but otherwise peaceful union
march.
</P>
<P>
   Each side calls the other capable of lies, deception, and dirty
tricks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had this incredible amount of surveillance and
harassment,'' said Lisa Fithian, an organizer of the coming
demonstrations, which she stressed are intended to be nonviolent.
``They've videotaped our building, the fire inspector showed up
suddenly, there are cop cars parked outside. It's outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   Countered Lieutenant Horace Frank, a spokesman for the Los
Angeles Police Department: ``We're not doing any surveillance. Our
job is to be aware of what's going on in the community. But that's
the kind of rhetoric they're stirring up in the hope we will not do
police work.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Democratic National Convention less than a week away,
both protesters and police are, as the saying goes, hoping for the
best while preparing for the worst. They are also looking to
Philadelphia's experience for hints of what could happen here. But
the lessons being learned are mixed.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Los Angeles police generally applaud the
restraint showed by their East Coast counterparts: no tear gas,
pepper spray, or rubber bullets fired into the crowds, even when a
few of the mostly peaceful protests turned violent. Police
Commander Mark Leap promised a similar response in Los Angeles,
insisting that force would be used only as a last resort.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators, however, say they came away from the Republican
National Convention more worried than ever that their First
Amendment rights to gather in public are at risk. In Philadephia,
they charge, police carried out a preemptive operation to collar
demonstration leaders, with bail for one set at $1 million although
he was charged only with misdemeanors. In another instance, police
with a now-sealed search warrant raided a puppet-making factory,
saying they would find evidence of plans to disrupt the city and
arresting more than 70 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is more than one way to prevent people from exercising
their First Amendment rights, and it doesn't always come at the end
of a baton,'' said James Lafferty, executive director of the Los
Angeles chapter of the National Lawyers Guild, which will have some
200 legal observers on the street and will represent arrested
demonstrators free of charge. ``People are chilled. My god, even
puppets are not safe. It's very alarming.''
</P>
<P>
   The LAPD, like other police departments nationwide, does have an
arsenal of weapons to stop any outbreak of violence during the
daily demonstrations, including a recently demonstrated chemical
that causes a person to smell so awful that others cannot come
near. But with its already besmirched reputation on the line after
the Rodney King beating, the 1991 riots, and an ongoing corruption
scandal that is the widest in memory, police officials understand
that their performance will be scrutinized closely.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the scandal, in which officers in the Rampart
district are accused of beating suspects, planting evidence, and
lying in court to win convictions of gang members, the federal
government is in talks with the city over how to improve the
tracking of problem officers. So far, one police officer from the
district has been fired as a result of the scandal, with other
dismissals expected. Some 70 officers are under investigation, and
there are indications that the corruption spread into other
districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to play dumb; there have been incidents that
tarnished our image,'' Frank said. ``We have to live through it and
go beyond it. . . . In all honesty, this convention is very
important for us. It's a chance to showcase the city of Los Angeles
and for the LAPD to shine. We're going to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The circumstances confronting both police and protesters in Los
Angeles, however, are far different from those faced in
Philadelphia, although police there were also under pressure to
keep their weapons holstered following last month's televised
beating of a car chase suspect.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the Republican convention was held in a sports
arena on the outskirts of the city, and protesters gathered there
in large numbers just once. In Los Angeles, delegates will convene
downtown, creating the possiblity of intentional traffic tie-ups
and shutdowns. Philadelphia also attracted no more than an
estimated 4,000 demonstrators. Tens of thousands are expected in
Los Angeles, with some estimates going as high as 50,000. The same
week, the homeless and other groups are to meet in Los Angeles,
including the North American Anarchist Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly not more relaxed after Philadelphia,'' said
Leap, the police commander. ``I can tell you that the planning and
the training we did before we went to Philadelphia (to observe) was
validated by what we saw in Philadelphia.''
</P>
<P>
   The outcome _ mostly peaceful protests, a few confrontations
resulting in injuries to police as well as protesters _ has also
calmed convention officials even as they erect wire fences around
the Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles. As many as four parades
are planned each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely not our place to comment on specific tactics,
but I can say that there were real predictions of doom in
Philadelphia and things went relatively smoothly,'' said Benjamin
Austin, a spokesman for the LA Convention 2000 host committee. ``We
applaud the city and also think it bodes well for us. They did a
good job of balancing the First Amendment right of protesters and
the needs of residents.''
</P>
<P>
   But protesters who plan to start arriving in Los Angeles later
this week, and the organizers now in place, say the city has
already tagged them as the enemy. Again and again, they stress that
they are adamant about holding peaceful protests and that they
themselves will do nothing to turn the massive demonstrations ugly.
Still, they will not be cowed into silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very nervous about what Philadelphia bodes for LA,''
said Han Shan, a spokesman for the Berkeley-based Ruckus Society, a
sort of graduate program for nonviolent liberal protesters whose
executive director is being held on $1 million bond. ``We're very,
very concerned. But one thing I'm gratified by is that they don't
get it. They think they can pick off one or 10 or 50 people and end
a movement that's calling for democracy, environmental protection,
basic human rights. Well, we're still coming to LA.''

SITE ALLOWS SHOPPERS TO SPEND REBATES ON SHARES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Retailers want you to shop on the Internet for everything from
lingerie to toys, but now there's new merchandise available on the
Web _ stock in the very companies from which you make your online
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   The choices for online stock purchase are ever expanding,
turning the Internet into a virtual mall not only for consumers,
but also for investors.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest twist, a Web site called www.stockback.com is
letting people combine shopping at 85 online retailers with buying
shares in a mutual fund investing in those and other stocks. The
way it works: Cash rebates on purchases made through
stockback.com's retail partners are deposited into your account,
which you can then use to buy mutual fund shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to turn ordinary consumers into owners of the
companies they patronize,'' said Timothy Parrott, president and a
founder of the New York-based company. ``It's bringing investing to
the masses.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the companies with an online presence that have already
signed up for the program, which will offer up to 20 percent cash
rebates convertible into Stockback fund shares: Eddie Bauer, Land's
End, Barnes &AMP; Noble, Sharper Image, and Toys ``R'' Us.
</P>
<P>
   Separate from Stockback, you can enroll online to buy stock
directly in a growing list of retailers, including CVS, Sony, Radio
Shack, Kmart, or Intimate Brands (which sells its wares through
Victoria's Secret and Bath &AMP; Body Works), through an individual
retailer's Web site, www.netstockdirect.com, or www.StockPower.com.
</P>
<P>
   There are also Web sites that let you purchase shares bit by bit
in all types of publicly traded companies, whether or not they're
online retailers and regardless of whether they offer their own
stock purchase plans: www.BUYandHOLD.com and www.ShareBuilder.com.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, you can buy stocks online through such brokers
as ETrade, Ameritrade, Charles Schwab &AMP; Co., Fidelity Investments,
and Vanguard.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a summary of some of the Web sites at which you can shop
for company stock:
</P>
<P>
   --www.stockback.com: Proclaiming ``there's a new way to invest _
it's called shopping,'' this site promises to let you put cash
rewards from online purchases at selected retailers into a mutual
fund that invests in those and other companies.
</P>
<P>
   While the Stockback fund still awaits approval from the
Securities and Exchange Commission, people already can shop and
start building up their cash rebate accounts in anticipation,
according to Parrott. The company's filings with the SEC say the
fund's objective is to provide long-term capital appreciation by
investing in the publicly traded stock of participating retailers
and other stocks the portfolio managers believe will increase in
value. The company's filings say the fund may also invest up to 30
percent of its assets in foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
   And while the fund will waive its management fees for a year and
will charge no upfront load, it will impose a 2 percent fee if you
redeem shares in less than one year and a 1 percent fee if you
redeem in less than two years. The company will soon announce it
has signed an agreement with Merrill Lynch to be the subadviser for
the fund.
</P>
<P>
   You must become a member by completing an online investment
account application and will be asked to agree to receive
electronic delivery of all fund statements and reports. Cash
rebates from purchases will be deposited directly into your
account. You must have at least $10 in your account before you can
buy shares in the mutual fund. And if you request the cash be sent
to you instead, a check processing fee of up to $5 will apply.
</P>
<P>
   So the decision to shop or invest at this site depends on
whether you like the retailers and whether you think the companies
in which the fund invests will make money.
</P>
<P>
   The fund will always own at least some shares in the retail
partners that are publicly traded, no matter what the firms'
financials look like. ``They will be represented in the fund if
they are a partner. The balancing is all up to Merrill Lynch. If it
finds they are not sound in various ways, they will not be heavily
weighted in the fund,'' Parrott said. ``That's what the merchants
want as well. You wouldn't want to be a merchant that forces
consumers to buy stock if it wasn't performing well.''
</P>
<P>
   Stockback.com is not the simplest or most efficient way to buy
stock in companies you like, but the site may be of interest to
shopaholics who otherwise can't invest or to people who like the
notion of getting cash rebates and mutual fund shares as they shop.
</P>
<P>
   --www.netstockdirect.com: Saying it's ``the source for direct
investing,'' this free site features information on more than 1,500
stock plans, nearly 600 of which allow you to buy your first shares
directly from the company, and the rest of which require you to
already own some shares in your name and reinvest dividends. About
50 of the plans allow you to enroll online through Netstock Direct.
</P>
<P>
   Among the top 10 requests for investment information, according
to a recent review of the site: General Electric, IBM, Nokia, and
Pfizer.
</P>
<P>
   The site allows you to search for stock plans a number of ways,
including by company name, whether they offer automatic deductions
from your bank account, or whether they offer an Individual
Retirement Account plan. And it allows you to compare plan details,
such as minimum investment and investment fee. Some plans feature
minimums of $50 to $250, and some charge no fee or just a few
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   So if you like the wares sold by Victoria's Secret or Bath &AMP;
Body Works, you can enroll online in the stock purchase plan for
Intimate Brands, owner of those retailers, through this site. Or if
your tastes run to products sold by Target, Campbell Soup,
Caterpillar, or Goodyear, you can enroll here for those stocks
plans.
</P>
<P>
   --www.StockPower.com: On its ``splash'' page that comes up
first, this site targets individual investors with the phrase ``You
know their products and services. Now invest directly with the
companies you trust.'' And it uses a new word to describe customers
who are also investors _ ``investomers.''
</P>
<P>
   Operating under the same idea as netstockdirect.com, but limited

HOW AN OLD LIBERAL RECONCILED HIS VIEWS WITH A SENATE PEER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sixteen years ago, two Vietnam veterans, John F.
Kerry and Al Gore, joined the elite club of the US Senate. They
were a study in contrasts, the Southerner who opposed gun control
and federal funding for abortion, and the New Englander who quickly
became one of the Senate's most liberal members.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the two men, both envisioning themselves as
possible future presidents, both well-heeled Ivy Leaguers, watched
each other warily, clashing on some issues, working together on
others.
</P>
<P>
   The clash nearly exploded: Last year, Kerry was uncertain enough
about Gore that he almost challenged the vice president for the
Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But the bond between the two men, woven through common interests
in the environment, technology and foreign affairs, has survived _
and has remained strong enough that Gore put Kerry at or near the
top of his list of potential running mates.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut was ultimately
Gore's choice, the search highlighted the
rivalry-turned-partnership of two ambitious Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The 1984 election, a landslide reelection of the Reagan-Bush
ticket, was a disaster for many Democrats. But Gore and Kerry were
among the survivors, and they viewed themselves as the future of
the party.
</P>
<P>
   From neighboring suites on the fourth floor of the Russell
Office Building, the two joined forces on everything from arms
control to veterans' benefits to the emerging world of computers
and technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an automatic camaraderie there, there was a start of
a friendship that had a lot to do with them being in the same class
where not many Democrats won that year,'' a Kerry associate said.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam linked the two veterans. Gore served as an Army
journalist, reporting the war more than participating in it. Kerry
found himself in the the thick of battle, serving as a highly
decorated Navy officer aboard a gunboat.
</P>
<P>
   But in other ways, the relationship was ideologically unsure.
Gore, whose father had lost the Senate seat in 1970 after he was
branded as too liberal, struck a much more conservative chord than
is consistent with his current image.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to avoid his father's fate, Gore earned a top rating
from the National Rifle Association and opposed federal funding for
abortion. These positions, said Bill Bradley, his chief primary
opponent, showed Gore's real beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry was quite the opposite. He embraced liberalism, as proudly
and defiantly as he once worked with a group called Vietnam
Veterans Against the War.
</P>
<P>
   When Michael S. Dukakis ran for governor in 1982, with Kerry as
running mate for lieutenant governor, some perceived Kerry as the
more liberal of the two. Later, in 1988, Dukakis was tagged as a
liberal, and lost to George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year their Senate arrival, Gore's and Kerry's
directions seemed clear. In 1985, when Congressional Quarterly
tabulated the 14 most important votes, the two senators agreed on
10 but disagreed on four revealing issues. Gore voted for, and
Kerry against, these four measures: spending $1.5 billion to buy 21
mobile MX nuclear missiles; limiting contributions to the United
Nations; relaxing many gun control laws; and further penalizing
employers who had knowingly hired illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   The rankings of Gore and Kerry, as compiled by liberal and
conservative groups, reflected those votes: Kerry agreed with the
liberal Americans for Democratic Action 85 percent of the time,
compared with 65 percent for Gore. Gore agreed with the American
Conservative Union 17 percent of the time, compared with 5 percent
for Kerry.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Senator Paul Simon, the Illinois Democrat who also
arrived in 1984, said Kerry and Gore got along well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that you differ doesn't mean you don't have a good
relationship,'' Simon said. ``I had a good relationship with Jesse
Helms, for example.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Kerry and Gore, like Simon himself, seemed to view
themselves as presidential material, Simon said. But Kerry and Gore
saw different paths.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Gore arrived in the Senate, he became a cofounder
of a group called the Democratic Leadership Council, which promotes
a moderate ``New Democrat'' agenda. Another cofounder was Bill
Clinton, then governor of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry did not join at that time, council officials said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until the mid-1990s that Kerry, partly in response to
the changing politics of the time, had changed his mind. Many
factors led to Kerry's decision: the Dukakis defeat in 1988, the
ascension of William F. Weld as governor of Massachusetts, and the
success of the New Democrats Clinton and Gore in the election.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry decided to join the club, and has become one of the most
active members of the Democratic Leadership Council in the last few
years, according to the council president, Al From.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kerry over the last four or five years has been almost as
active as any other senator,'' From said. ``He has taken the lead
on education policy for us.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Kerry has often said he has been misunderstood
as a doctrinaire liberal. He has maintained that while he is on the
left on some issues, his views in many areas defy classification.
Kerry, for example, backed the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit
reduction bill during the Reagan administration, a position at odds
with that of many liberal groups.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry also opposed his usual allies in organized labor by
backing free-trade deals, and he upset some teachers' groups by
backing charter schools and the implementation of strict graduation
standards.
</P>
<P>
   By 1997, Kerry was a different sort of senator than when he had
arrived. He voted with the American Conservative Union 16 percent
of the time, compared with his 5 percent in 1985 and zero percent
for Senator Edward M. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry had become a bona fide New Democrat. And Gore and the rest
of the Democratic Leadership Council crowd noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This liberal label stuff is silly,'' Dukakis said. ``John is a
good, solid liberal Democrat, call him what you will; but he is
also one to say that he doesn't agree with yesterday's liberal
orthodoxy, and I'm not sure I agree with him all the time. It has
nothing to do with moving to the center. I think it's a strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, meanwhile, was also evolving, moving away from some of his
conservative positions, becoming a supporter of gun control laws
and of federal funding for abortion, while remaining solidly in New
Democrat territory on issues such as free trade.
</P>
<P>
   By the time of the 1992 presidential race, Kerry and Gore had
both changed; they had moved closer ideologically. The relationship
was solidified by their work together on the environment, according
to Marla Romash, a former Gore aide. In June 1992, the two traveled
together to Brazil to attend the Earth Summit and to push for
reductions in global warming.
</P>
<P>
   But Kerry and Gore remained at odds on some issues. In 1991, in
one of the most important votes of Gore's career, the Tennessean
voted to support President Bush's request to use force in the Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry voted against the resolution. He said he wanted to give
economic sanctions more time to work ``before rushing headlong into
war.''
</P>
<P>
   By some accounts, Gore's vote helped him secure the vice
presidential spot. Bill Clinton had waffled on whether he would
have voted for the use of force, and the governor of Arkansas was
searching for a running mate with foreign policy experience who had
backed the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry's name came up in the initial search for a Gore running
mate, but he was not seriously considered, partly because of his
voting record and his opposition to the Gulf War resolution.
Indeed, Kerry's Gulf War vote has been a sore point with some Gore
aides in the current process.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, when the Clinton-Gore team took office, Kerry
became one of the administration's most consistent supporters. In
1999, for example, Kerry and three other senators voted with the
administration 93 percent of the time, the highest of any members
of the US Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Still, by late 1999, Kerry was seriously considering challenging
Gore for the presidential nomination. It was partly a political
question: Could Gore survive the country's disdain for Clinton's
misconduct in the Oval Office, and would there ever be a better
opportunity for Kerry to fulfill his ambition to be president?
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the impeachment trial and the prospect of fighting
an incumbent vice president for campaign cash and party loyalty put
an end to the idea of challenging Gore. Moreover, ``John couldn't
find the policy rationale to run against him,'' a Kerry associate
said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Kerry made his decision, a source said, Gore
called him up to ask: How would you have run against me?
</P>
<P>
   The two agreed to meet at the vice president's mansion on the
grounds of the Naval Observatory in March 1999. For two hours, they
hashed out issues. Kerry outlined potential vulnerabilities for
Gore and suggested courses of action. But mostly, it was ``a
wonk-fest,'' said an aide who participated.
</P>
<P>
   It was also the political equivalent of a peace conference, and
the two agreed to work together. Gore and Kerry had never been
intimate friends, but they shared a belief in the need to keep the
White House in Democratic hands.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry promised the vice president that he would vigorously
campaign in New Hampshire, where many residents came from
Massachusetts and were familiar with the senator.
</P>
<P>
   In the ensuing months, as former senator Bill Bradley began
mounting a serious challenge to Gore in New Hampshire, Gore
consulted with Kerry on issues such as health care and education.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as Gore pondered his choice of a running mate, some of
his associates had a nagging worry: While they believed Kerry had
changed from his dyed-in-the-wool liberal days into a New Democrat,
they feared he would be instantly caricatured by Republicans as
Dukakis's liberal lieutenant governor from Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   It helped explain why some aides were pushing other New
Democrats whose credentials would be less subject to challenge,
such as the eventual choice, Lieberman, or Senator John Edwards of
North Carolina.

GRANDEE, 72, FAVORS GOP'S SOUTHERN TILT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ When Clarke Reed of Mississippi attended his
first Republican convention in 1964, there was a liberal
Northeastern wing that exerted influence in the national party, the
South was barren ground for the GOP, and the few registered black
voters in his home state were deserting the party of Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   As delegates to the 2000 convention scattered to all parts of
the country, the evolution of the party was obvious. ``The South
became Republican, and there are no liberals left in the party,''
the 72-year-old GOP grandee said with some satisfaction. ``Barry
Goldwater was the icebreaker, and Ronald Reagan put the icing on
the cake.''
</P>
<P>
   In the decades since Goldwater captured the Republican
presidential nomination at San Francisco's Cow Palace and won
Mississippi's electoral votes 36 years ago, Reed grew into a
colorful figure.
</P>
<P>
   His about-face at the 1976 convention helped ensure President
Gerald Ford's victory over Reagan. He was cast into political
purgatory by Reagan four years later only to bounce back to see his
protege, Haley Barbour, become national GOP chairman and his fellow
Mississippian, Trent Lott, ascend to the role of Senate majority
leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal was to get the South into the party,'' he said. ``I
was focused on that all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he finds himself at home in the current conservative
majority, Reed has occasionally raised a bit of hell at the
Republican gatherings. On the eve of this year's convention, the
10th that Reed has attended, he was walking along Walnut Street in
downtown Philadelphia, wearing slightly mismatched Palm Beach
jacket and slacks and barking into a cell phone: ``Morton! Morton!
Can you hear me?'' Reed was trying to rally one of his allies to
fight a proposed rule change that would give members of the
Republican National Committee delegate status. Despite his efforts,
the measure was ratified by the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting as bad as the damned Democrats,'' he said of the
plan to swell the number of convention delegates in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Reed prefers smaller, more manageable conventions where
Southerners, often voting as a bloc, have been able to wield
inordinate power in a party where they once had none.
</P>
<P>
   Like most Southerners his age, Reed was raised a Democrat. He
was lured to the Republican Party during Richard Nixon's 1960
campaign after reading ``The Conservative Mind'' by Russell Kirk.
``It was very profound,'' Reed said. ``Kirk had never been to the
South, but he understood the South.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1966, Reed had been drafted as chairman of a growing state
party. He got help from an unusual source. His friend, Hodding
Carter 3d, an ardent Democrat and editor of the local newspaper,
was so interested in encouraging a two-party system in a state
controlled by reactionary Democrats ``that he played up anything I
did,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1972 convention in Miami Beach, Reed said, he ``lost 8
pounds and was up all night without sleep'' fighting the Ripon
Society, an organization of liberal Republicans, over its bid to
impose proportional representation on the party.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, Reed attracted national attention at the GOP
convention in Kansas City, where Reagan was threatening to wrest
the nomination from Ford. Reagan's strategists counted Reed in
their camp, and they looked to him to deliver Mississippi's
delegation. Reed was prepared to do so until Reagan chose a
moderate Easterner, Pennsylvania senator Richard Schweiker, as his
prospective running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Playing a cat-and-mouse game, Reed engineered a Mississippi vote
for Ford that broke the momentum of the Reagan challenge. In a
recent column that recalled that fight, Al Hunt of the Wall Street
Journal said Reed ``switched allegiances several times.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't change but once and that was because of Schweiker,''
Reed said. ``The Reagan guys screwed up and they needed me as a
scapegoat.''
</P>
<P>
   The guys also remembered. During Reagan's administration, Reed
was frozen out of patronage for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Restored to good graces, he epitomizes good-natured
conservatism, and this year is solidly aligned with George W. Bush.

NRA POWER IN ELECTIONS GROWS AS RANKS SWELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE, Fla. _ Virginia Robertson is a great-grandmother who
doesn't frighten easily, not with her fireball personality and her
.38 pistol.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone,'' Robertson said of this God-and-guns region of
central Florida, ``knows I have a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   There is one thing that scares the 66-year-old, slightly built
woman: that the government might take away her weapon. And that
threat, so passionately and relentlessly invoked by the National
Rifle Association, has turned the gray-haired Robertson into a
loyal foot soldier for the NRA and its approved candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA can use people like Robertson, and it does.
</P>
<P>
   Trained at professionally run grass-roots seminars, the NRA's
activist army will knock on doors, handle the phones for NRA-backed
candidates, put signs in their yards and bumper stickers on their
cars. They are registering voters in their neighborhoods, and at
gun shows and firearms clubs.
</P>
<P>
   They will warn fellow gun owners that any kind of gun control
will result, ultimately, in the confiscation of their weapons, and
they will threaten to oust lawmakers who vote for those gun
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA has four to five grass-roots organizers traversing the
country between now and November, each averaging about a training
seminar a day, NRA spokesman Bill Powers said.
</P>
<P>
   While the heavy political influence of the NRA is often
attributed to its financial strength _ the group reported nearly
$122 million in revenue on its 1998 income tax return _ the NRA's
power is in the volunteer work of its 3.8 million loyal members.
The most valuable currency, supporters and detractors alike agree,
is fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fear motivates people,'' said James Jay Baker, executive
director of the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action and the
group's chief Washington lobbyist. ``There are a lot of people who
are scared of Al Gore becoming president.''
</P>
<P>
   The NRA has turned the national campaign into ``a culture war,
between the people who know and love guns, and everybody else,''
said Josh Sugarman, head of the Violence Policy Center based in
Washington, one of the NRA's biggest foes. ``They really do believe
this is a battle for their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   For candidates who end up on the NRA's hit list, gun control can
provoke a battle for their political lives.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress work in dread of receiving the hundreds,
even thousands, of postcards, letters, and phone calls from NRA
members disappointed by their votes on a gun-control measure. When
Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, voted in favor of a
relatively minor piece of gun-control legislation, ``we got
hundreds of postcards overnight,'' said a Leahy aide.
</P>
<P>
   For the November elections, the NRA has dedicated its forces to
defeating Gore and a host of other congressional candidates. Gore
is considered the biggest threat, but the group is meticulous about
keeping track of the voting records and public statements of
candidates for lower office.
</P>
<P>
   Baker won't say who is on the hit list, but he points to five
states _ Missouri, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, and Florida _ as
critical. All are potential swing states in the presidential
election, and each has at least one congressional or US Senate
campaign of NRA interest, he said.
</P>
<P>
   With the Democrats just six seats away from taking back the
House of Representatives, the NRA is making its biggest
election-year push ever, Powers said.
</P>
<P>
   The lobby's election apparatus can rarely move the vote by more
than 5 percentage points, Baker admitted _ meaning the NRA doesn't
even bother trying to defeat such gun-control stalwarts as Senator
Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, who don't face close
races.
</P>
<P>
   But the old-style politicking the NRA employs can rattle a
campaign, and even defeat it.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Ridge, now the Republican governor of Pennsylvania, had been
a solid pro-gun vote when he was a House member. But when he voted
in favor of a ban on assault weapons in May 1994, the NRA ``mailed
hundreds of thousands of orange postcards'' urging people to vote
for Ridge's gubernatorial primary opponent, Mike Fisher, said Bill
McInturff, a partner with Virginia-based Public Opinion Strategies.
Fisher went from 5 percent in the polls to 14 percent in five days.
He did not win the primary.
</P>
<P>
   The late Representative Mike Synar, Democrat of Oklahoma, was
among the NRA's targets who were defeated in 1994, observers note.
``They really just went after him,'' said Larry Makinson of the
Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington-based campaign-finance
watchdog group. ``They really do put the fear into candidates'
hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   There aren't many lobbies that draw the level of both devotion
and vitriol the NRA attracts. But the NRA has more than mere status
in the nation's capital; it has a mystique. It has been credited _
or blamed, depending on one's politics _ for the Republican sweep
of the House of Representatives in 1994, putting the GOP in control
of the House for the first time in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Fortune magazine, which conducts an annual survey of federal
lawmakers, lobbyists, and political aides to rank Washington
lobbies, placed the NRA in a tie for the number two spot this year,
up from fourth place and after the American Association of Retired
Persons.
</P>
<P>
   Membership is climbing steadily, Powers said. Wayne LaPierre,
NRA executive director, predicted in May that the count would reach
4 million by Election Day. ``Now, it looks like we might hit that
by Labor Day,'' Powers said.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy is based on a simple credo: Money doesn't win
elections. Votes do.
</P>
<P>
   Of the well over $100 million the NRA spends annually to fight
for gun rights, a tiny fraction goes toward direct contributions to
political campaigns. In the 1998 election cycle, the group spent
about $1.6 million on political contributions, according to the
Center for Responsive Politics. In the current election cycle, the
NRA has given less than $800,000 so far.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the NRA's efforts are focused on a massive member
education effort, followed by a volunteer get-out-the-vote push
that awes even its enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Every NRA member will receive at least one piece of direct mail
from the organization, Baker said. That's in addition to the
newsletters and bulletins NRA members get. Mailings to members are
tailored to each state, informing gun owners of the records of
their elected representatives. The group's federal tax return does
not list direct mail as a separate expense. The NRA spent about $25
million on ``member communication,'' bulletins, and newsletters in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA follows the organizing tactics of a national political
party: Drum up membership, assign grass-roots organizers, mobilize
the more active members, and register sympathizers to vote.
</P>
<P>
   An official from the Republican National Committee who attended
one of the grass-roots training seminars went promptly to the
national committee chairman, Joe Nicholson, and said, ``why aren't
we doing this?'' Powers recounted.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA is ``the best at what they do,'' said a frustrated
Sugarman. ``It's not just the money. They have a hard-core group of
activists who are the ultimate single-issue voters.''
</P>
<P>
   The gun group operates an extensive, easy-to-navigate Internet
site that includes everything from gun safety tips to detailed
run-downs on the gun-related voting records of members of Congress.
The Web site has perhaps the most comprehensive account of pending
gun-related legislation at both the state and federal levels. A
toll-free hot line aids those without computers.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent training seminar in Melbourne, eager members of the
NRA rank and file were given their marching orders: man the phones
and pound the pavement to help out the campaign of Representative
Dave Weldon, Republican of Florida. The incumbent is in a
competitive race against challenger Patsy Furth, a Democratic state
senator who also happens to be a cousin of House minority leader
Richard A. Gephardt, Democrat of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two things will work for us: shoe leather and votes,''
Patridge, ebullient as a professional motivational speaker, told
about 200 NRA members attending the training session. Patridge
urged the members to ``utilize their natural resources'' _ gun
shows, shops, clubs, and ranges.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to hunt where the ducks are,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other NRA leaders help members write letters to the editor
trumpeting gun rights. Some members offer to drive voters to the
polls or to register gun owners to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Tips are offered by organizers and members alike: Call voters
from home, a member advised, in case they have caller ID and won't
answer a call from a campaign office. Blanket congressional offices
with paper, since a printed letter is harder to ignore than an
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the three-hour meeting, the group is mobilized and
excited.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first one I've ever attended,'' said Jackie
Warzecha, fingering her necklace, a silver bullet engraved with the
signature of the NRA president, Charlton Heston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize how many of my rights were about to be taken
away,'' Warzecha added, lining up to chat with Weldon's deputy
campaign manager, Brian Chase, who was on hand to gather
volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   The curious thing is, Furth said, that she's not antigun. The
state senator approves of trigger locks and of some restrictions on
semiautomatic weapons. But Furth opposes registration of guns, on
the theory that only law-abiding gun owners would comply anyway.
``I have a husband and brothers who hunt. I support the Second
Amendment,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Furth figures that the hostility stems from an NRA questionnaire
she answered when she was running for state office in 1996. ``They
sent it back with a big `F' on it. I had failed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Furth's transgression is that she favors trigger locks and
controls on assault weapons, Patridge said. Weldon has been a
reliable, pro-gun vote, Patridge said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither candidate in that congressional race expects guns to be
a substantial issue in the campaign. But that doesn't matter to the
NRA, which wants to keep out of office advocates of even the
mildest kind of gun control.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA will sometimes run a campaign ad against a candidate
that has nothing to do with guns, but strikes at an issue that
could leave the candidate more vulnerable. ``We do it with some
trepidation,'' Baker said, declining to specify races in which the
NRA used the strategy.
</P>
<P>
   And Baker admitted that openly allying with the NRA may not
benefit some candidates in certain parts of the country. Republican
presidential nominee George W. Bush took some heat when an NRA
official bragged that if Bush were elected, ``we'll have a
president . . . where we work out of their office.'' Soon
afterward, Bush proposed giving away trigger locks in Texas to
heighten gun safety.
</P>
<P>
   Even in gun-friendly districts like central Florida, members
were urged not to wear NRA caps or sweat shirts when canvassing
neighborhoods on behalf of a candidate, because the voter might not
be sympathetic to the NRA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking about promoting the NRA here. We're talking
about electing candidates,'' Patridge warned the group.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the NRA takes some delight in being demonized. Every
attack, Baker said, just ups the membership. Gun-control activists
``think they're going to attract the suburban female vote,'' Baker
said. ``But in the process, they're just attracting more gun
votes.''

LAWS WOULD ALLOW UNLIMITED TRUSTS _ FOREVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT BERNARD NELSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before Thomas Jefferson uttered a word about equality among men,
Americans were already squeamish about allowing huge family
fortunes to pass from generation to generation. The idea reminded
them of European aristocracy, and it didn't fit the self-made-man
ethos of the New World.
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward a couple of centuries to the newer New World.
</P>
<P>
   These days, jobs are plentiful, people are flush, and
aristocratic Europeans are the butt of jokes rather than a source
of fear and loathing. For a mostly middle-class America, dreams of
dot-com millions have replaced worries about redistributing wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging from that cultural shift, two seemingly unrelated
trends are on the verge of shaking up financial and estate planning
in a way that would have shocked Jeffersonian America, if not
Jefferson himself.
</P>
<P>
   Congress on the one hand and state lawmakers on the other could
soon make it possible to pass down unlimited amounts of money to
future generations tax and penalty free. The twist: Not only is the
change unintentional, but it has gone largely unnoticed by both the
politicians creating it and the money pros who will have to
implement it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are being rushed into law without any thought to the
long-term consequences,'' said Ira Mark Bloom, a professor at
Albany Law School in Albany, N.Y. ``Unknowingly, perhaps, we're
setting in motion things which could have a tremendous impact on
future generations.''
</P>
<P>
   The repeal of two obscure pieces of legislation _ known as the
uniform rule against perpetuities and the generation-skipping
transfer tax _ would combine to cause that impact. People would
then be able to create trusts of unlimited size and keep them in
force for an unlimited number of years for an unlimited number of
beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``For wealthy people, that's a pretty big deal,'' Bloom said.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the two trends has actually been in motion for
three years. The Alaskan legislature prompted it in 1997, when in
trying to attract bank deposits and trust accounts it killed off
the rule against perpetuities, which had been in force in all but
three other states.
</P>
<P>
   Worried about losing sizeable trust accounts across state lines,
eight other legislatures have followed suit. Trust accounts can be
an important source of revenue for states, since they provide
business for local financial professionals and, in most cases,
generate state income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Five more states have similar legislation pending, and one _
Florida _ recently amended its rule rather than scrapping it
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nice thing to call this type of phenomenon is competitive
federalism, and the not-so-nice thing to call it is a race for the
bottom,'' Bloom said. ``It's hard for one state to be principled
when it's facing a tremendous loss of money to a neighboring
state.''
</P>
<P>
   The rule in question, so fiendishly complex that lawyers in
Massachusetts can't be held liable for malpractice if they
misinterpret it, essentially limits the time a trust can lock up
assets to 21 years after the deaths of beneficiaries living when it
was created.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, a wealthy individual couldn't put land (or
anything else) worth millions of dollars in trust at her death with
the stipulation that her family live off the proceeds forever.
Within a century or so, at most, the land would have to be passed
to a person or group of people who would have to pay regular taxes
and would be allowed to do what they liked with the property.
</P>
<P>
   Scrapping the rule allows families to create so-called dynasty
or wealth-building trusts, which could survive multiple
generations. But estate planners say people haven't been stampeding
across state lines to create new accounts.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the second piece of the trend puzzle, the federal
government's generation-skipping transfer tax, limits the amount of
money people can pass on to any generation beyond their children to
slightly more than $1 million. Any more than that gets hit with a
55 percent tax _ on top of regular gift and estate taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impact from repealing the perpetuities rule is clearly
limited by the (generation-skipping transfer tax),'' said Bruno
Graziano, an estate-planning lawyer and analyst with CCH Inc., in
Riverwoods, Ill. ``If they were to repeal the (federal tax), too,
that might be a different story.''
</P>
<P>
   It's possible that such a repeal could happen in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
   Almost unnoticed in the hotly debated and widely reported
congressional bill that would eliminate the federal estate tax is a
provision that would also deep-six the generation-skipping tax. If
the bill becomes law, both taxes would be phased out over the next
decade, making limitless trusts possible.
</P>
<P>
   Both houses of Congress approved the estate tax legislation this
summer, but neither was by a veto-proof margin. The law's prospects
are therefore murky, since President Clinton has promised to reject
the bill when it reaches his desk this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush, on the other
hand, has said he would sign it if he is elected and is sent a
similar measure next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a huge potential change when you think about it,'' said
Neil Harl, an Iowa State University professor who has written three
books on estate planning. ``If people start to park their wealth in
permanent trusts, it would literally transform the economic
structure of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   It would also transform estate and financial planning for
millions of Americans who aren't in a hurry to give Uncle Sam money
and property they've earned over the course of a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Millis estate planner Robert Matson said dynasty trusts would be
helpful for families in a variety of situations. That's especially
true in regions such as New England, he said, where soaring home
values and the rising stock market have combined to make the
current generation wealthier than any before it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I once worked with a client who kept a bust of his great
grandfather in his office, and he literally had tears well up in
his eyes when I asked about the man,'' Matson said. ``The guy had
set up some kind of trust generations ago that allowed his great
grandson to buy a business of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's good estate planning and that's the kind of thing
dynasty trusts would make easier to accomplish,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bloom, of the Albany Law School, said he agrees the trusts would
be helpful for many, but he has joined University of Michigan law
professor Lawrence Waggoner on a lonely mission to convince
politicians to also consider problems with them.
</P>
<P>
   Bloom wrote an article on the downsides to the trusts in an
April issue of the journal Tax Notes, successfully testified
against a bill that would have repealed the rule against
perpetuities last year in New York, and has a prepared speech
(slides included) he gives to lawyers' groups and anyone else who
will listen. So far, though, he hasn't found many takers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this has been viewed as an esoteric topic only lawyers
and academics care about,'' he said this week. ``But it is clearly
something that should be looked at closely by a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bloom is no hard-and-fast advocate for the status quo,
either. He just wants state legislatures to consider the long-term
consequences of repealing the perpetuities rule, including the
widening of the wealth gap and consolidation of power in the hands
of corporate trustees.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he asked, ``do you really want to allow somebody who
dies in 2010 to have dead-hand control over property thousands of
years from now?''
</P>
<P>
   To put the question in perspective, he asks people to imagine
the restrictions a rich landowner might have placed on his property
at the time of Christ. Then imagine trying to put those
restrictions into practice now for hundreds of thousands of living
decendents with property that could have grown to unimaginable
value.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers are staggering, and we won't even get into the
problems such a trust could create in 10,000 years or 100,000
years,'' Bloom said. ``Changing the rules is expedient now, but we
don't seem to be taking responsibility for what it might do to
future generations.''
</P>
<P>
   As a middle ground, Florida recently extended its perpetuities
rule to allow trusts to remain in effect for 360 years. That's the
type of compromise Bloom would like to see more states consider,
since it addresses the demand for more lenient trusts without
creating the mind-boggling problems of perpetual accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Matson, who is president-elect of the Boston Estate Planning
Council, said he suspects politicians haven't completely thought
through the issues yet. Once they do, he said, they will probably
come up with compromises that create a standardized system
nationwide that deals with Bloom's concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is too big of a deal in the estate planning world to
leave to chance,'' Matson said. ``It might take a little while, but
there are smart people who will figure these things out.''

FOREVER NEIL YOUNG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   About 15 years ago, when Neil Young had just shifted into a
proudly contrarian country phase of his career, he was asked how he
had come to that point. ``I feel like I could be likened to an old
hound circling on a rug for the past five years,'' he answered,
``and I think I've finally found my spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Young was wrong, of course. Time has shown he never does quite
find his spot on that musical rug. It's for this reason, among
others, that he's earned the love and respect of multiple
generations. We never know where he's headed _ toward contemplative
acoustic-based pop or anarchic noise _ and we're pretty sure he
doesn't either. His latest work, ``Silver and Gold,'' is a highly
regarded, comfy kind of album: homespun, contented, easy on the
ears. Given this, it's likely he and his band _ which includes
guitarist Ben Keith, keyboardist Spooner Oldham, bassist Donald
``Duck'' Dunn, drummer Jim Keltner, and Young's wife, Pegi Young,
and Astrid Young on background vocals _ will let it rip and roar
when they play the Tweeter Center for the Performing Arts in Boston
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Step back and ponder this: How many still-active rockers who
began their ascent to fame and fortune in the 1960s are still
relevent artistically? That is, how many make new music we readily
anticipate? Precious few. Not Bob Dylan, Roger McGuinn, Joan Baez,
or Paul McCartney. Not the Beach Boys or Pink Floyd. Certainly not
Crosby, Stills &AMP; Nash _ not without Young. We all know that had
Young not joined C S &AMP; N for their tour earlier this year, the show
would have been at the Orpheum, not the FleetCenter. It's Young who
provides the edge, be it on a simple, raging guitar lead or in that
whiny voice. Or, maybe, in the choice of song. You don't think it's
Crosby, Stills, or Nash's idea to howl through the murderous ``Down
by the River,'' now, do you?
</P>
<P>
   These aformentioned artists have their audiences. But going to
see them is, essentially, a nostalgic act: You hope Dylan's sonic
reinventions will at least remind you of the original song; you're
really happy McCartney trots out some Beatles hits.
</P>
<P>
   Young's success, with audiences and critics alike, is rooted in
his sense of musical adventure, of taking risks that may well
alienate somebody. That and his willing embrace of duality, of a
melody that glides and a feedback-ridden guitar lead. Calm and
chaos shake hands and dance.
</P>
<P>
   Young followed his major-league breakthrough of ``Harvest'' in
1972 with a wretched, meandering soundtrack to a film he wrote and
directed, ``Journey Through the Past.'' Two subsequent albums, ``On
the Beach'' and ``Zuma,'' were notable for desolate moods and
haunting songs. In 1976, responding to a stormy time in his own
life and in the lives of his friends and bandmates, Young headed
for the gutter and recorded the bleak, shaky, but often brilliant
``Tonight's the Night.'' At this point, much of his audience
decided to go elsewhere. From ``Heart of Gold'' to the heart of
darkness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Comes a Time'' was a return to folk-rock bliss in 1978. The
following year, Young responded to the challenge of punk rock with
``Rust Never Sleeps,'' arguably his best work. In the '80s he
released three tepid genre experiments: synth-pop (``Trans''),
rockabilly (``Everybody's Rockin' ''), and R&AMP;B (``This Note's for
You''). His label, Geffen, sued him for making records that didn't
sound like Neil Young records. There followed the glorious comeback
of ``Freedom,'' and still to come were the blitzkrieg of ``Ragged
Glory'' and the pastoral calm of ``Harvest Moon.'' Young, at 54,
fits in with young pierced punks as well as he does with a banjo
player and a fiddler on a backwoods dusty porch.
</P>
<P>
   He was the oldest guy to headline the multiband, jam-oriented
H.O.R.D.E. tour. He toured with New York avant-garde band Sonic
Youth and longtime punk heroes Social Distortion. He recorded an
album with Pearl Jam, ``Mirror Ball.'' None of this came off as a
music biz-generated attempt at Capturing That Youth Market (unlike,
say, Carlos Santana's hit of last year).
</P>
<P>
   What all this suggests is this: That while most rockers hit a
creative peak in their 20s or 30s, you cannot guarantee that Young
has hit his. His heyday might not be behind him _ and that keeps
you tuned in. Sure, when Young plays in concert he'll ding your
memory bell, but his is not a nostalgia trip. He may even play
unrecorded songs _ he's got a sizzling rocker called ``Ordinary
People'' that has seen release only on bootlegs.
</P>
<P>
   He's also got hundreds of other unreleased songs sitting in his
vaults, awaiting release. Young reportedly (key word
``reportedly'') has an eight-disc archival set covering the years
up through 1972 ready for release this fall. Right now, a
spokeswoman for his label, Warner Bros., says the box is not yet
listed for a release date. The first of a projected four, this
summing-up has been postponed before due to Young's idiosyncrasies.
</P>
<P>
   He's mercurial, Neil Young is. Lord knows, he's no closet
socialist _ he's asking his fans to get friendly with credit card
debt if they want to attend his shows. (Top ticket for this one:
$150.) He is far from the most technically brilliant guitarist
around, but in a pinch whom do you want to play the solo that
transports you to another realm? He's not the most pitch-perfect
singer, but who conveys both pleasure (``Rockin' in the Free
World'') and pain (``The Needle and the Damage Done'') better than
Young?
</P>
<P>
   And, oh yes, there's this. When Lynyrd Skynyrd took a shot at
Young for his antiracist ballad ``Southern Man'' in ``Sweet Home
Alabama,'' Young responded once by joining Lynyrd Skynyrd onstage
to sing that very song. Can you imagine how much fun Neil Young
must have had singing ``I hope Neil Young will remember/Southern
man don't need him around anyhow!''? You can't beat that kind of
perverse glee.

ALLEGED RACISM AND CENSORSHIP MEET
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   cc,78p3 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Joe Rhodes was in his Studio City duplex late one night last week,
watching his neighbors in the ``Big Brother'' house online, when
his breath was taken away.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie, the young cancer survivor with one leg, was telling
racist jokes, for all the world to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were not just innocuous, wink-and-nod things _ (a racial
slur directed at African-Americans) was the punchline to one,''
said Rhodes, a free-lance writer. ``But they don't show that (on
CBS). They've posited him as this lovable cancer victim with wacky
Fonzie characteristics, when, in fact, he's in there saying harsh
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (ousted houseguest and racial provocateur) Will told a joke
that was derogatory about a white guy, I'll bet you big money
that'd be on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   ``William never told racist jokes, and if he had, they would not
have been on the show,'' responds Diane Ekeblad, CBS publicist for
the series, who acknowledges that Eddie has, in fact, told facist
jokes. ``If an interesting conversation occurred as a result of the
joke, if others got on him about it, then that would be
interesting, that would be on the show. But there's no place for
that on the show, and it certainly isn't a double standard.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lisa Hoffman, an L.A. attorney, believes, ``The fact that
the people in the house let those comments slide is an issue in
itself. It shows the effects of peer pressure and the desire not to
offend people and not be voted out.''
</P>
<P>
   Ekeblad suggests that as the houseguests spend more time in the
``Big Brother'' house, they become less conscious of the cameras
and microphones surrounding them, helping remove their inhibitions.
She added, ``Part of the issue that's coming out is that Eddie
drinks a lot. He was talking about it (Monday). That's more of his
story; we're learning more about him. This is not to say that side
of him is never gonna come out. It depends on what they do from day
to day.''
</P>
<P>
   (Drinking, in fact, has been a way of life for several of the
houseguests, so much so that on Wednesday evening, after the
banishment, ``Big Brother'' assembled the remaining roomies and
announced, ``We have major concerns about the hours you've been
keeping and the amount of alcohol you've been drinking. We're
concerned about your health. We think you've been keeping hours
that are unhealthy and you've been drinking to excess.''
Immediately, all the live Internet streams cut to the camera in the
chicken coop.)
</P>
<P>
   Given that viewers vote out the housemates _ the only one not
ousted wins $500,000 _ based largely on impressions they get from
the CBS broadcasts, how the show's producers choose to depict each
of them becomes crucial.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Thompson, founding director of the Center for the Study
of Popular Television and a professor at Syracuse University,
observes, ``The thinking with Eddie may have been, `If we put this
on the air, we'll catch some flak for it.' But it would also make
it more exciting, which is something they need to do before the
people who are watching it begin to drop off. A good scandal like
that would be helpful. It shows a lack of spine, that they thought
it was not worth doing. So why did they not do the same with Will?
It goes back to the old notion that the media is still not
completely fair or balanced in the way it depicts genders and
races.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson laughs when calling CBS' decision to sweep Eddie's bad
manners under the rug ``a major breach of etiquette _ that implies
that there are some rules of etiquette for this show, which there
aren't. Putting it on the air was the major breach of etiquette.''
</P>
<P>
   Viewers, particularly of the live online streams, are detecting
a queasy racial subtext emanating from the ``Big Brother'' house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Will's gone, with the exception of Cassandra _ and she
seems to be excluded a lot anyway _ it's become a very homogenous
group,'' observes Paul Sims, creator of bigbrotherblows.com, a Web
site mocking the show. ``Curtis is a very Americanized Asian. It's
an artificial world that's very white. In a microcosm where
everyone is like you, it may be easy to say hurtful and hateful
things. Eddie's very foolish. I don't think he would've told that
joke with Will still in the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes and Hoffman also say that racism seems to be behind
discussions among Eddie, George and Karen on voting in a bloc
against Cassandra, the lone remaining African-American houseguest.
``Cassandra is on their hit list because they don't relate to
her,'' Hoffman says. ``They don't relate to (Asian-American)
Curtis,'' whom the houseguests had ``marked for banishment'' last
week (viewers voted out stripper Jordan). That, too, has not made
it on the broadcast version of the show _ or on the series'
official Web site, which dwells on much other minutiae of the
houseguests' lives.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman sent a letter of complaint to CBS stating, in part,
``CBS and `Big Brother's' producers have publicly announced that
hate speech will not be tolerated in the `Big Brother' house. Yet,
within the last week alone, Eddie has told racist `jokes' about
African-Americans, Puerto Ricans and Asians; he has called a female
houseguest a (mysogynistic slur); and he has spoken approvingly
about physical violence toward homosexuals. The fact that Eddie's
housemates have apparently let such comments go without objection
is disappointing. The fact that CBS has permitted Eddie's
repulsive, hateful words to be broadcast over the World Wide Web,
yet has failed to include any reference to them in the television
broadcast or Web site articles that reach the vast majority of `Big
Brother's' audience, is deplorable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The producers have apparently decided to conceal Eddie's vile
comments and behavior from the viewers, while highlighting the
negative behavior of other houseguests. The network's viewers _ as
well as its sponsors _ are entitled to an honest portrayal of
Eddie's conduct as well,'' Hoffman wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no conspiracy in terms of trying to position people
to look one way or another,'' says Ekeblad. ``We have a 22-minute
show to scrunch a lot of stuff into.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman's not so sure. ``The producers of the show are
manipulating things far more than they let on,'' she says. She
pointed to the house's ``roast'' of Jordan and Curtis _ the guests
``marked for banishment'' _ that aired Tuesday night. According to
those who saw it on the Internet, the houseguests were told to put
on the roast and even given jokes to tell.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were forced to do it even though they didn't want to,''
Hoffman says, adding that the broadcast version didn't make it
clear that many of the jokes delivered during the roast were
scripted by ``Big Brother.''
</P>
<P>
   At the roast, Hoffman says, ``Eddie made comments that Jordan
was welcome in his home. But they didn't show that later, he said
if she did show up, she'd get a drink thrown in her face. They're
attempting to portray this one person in a much more positive
light.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Brother'' was certainly not shy about showing Will
``Mega'' Collins at his most confrontational, which promptly led to
his ouster, the first of the series. But as Rhodes saw it online,
the other houseguest ``marked for banishment'' _ Jordan again _
``was clearly more a pain in the butt than he was, but they didn't
show any of that. Sure, Will was juvenile, but he was also
thoughtful, insightful and compassionate. They clearly wanted
Jordan to stay, though, because they thought she was more
provocative. So they showed just enough to make her interesting but
not enough to show what a pain in the ass she was. It was a
foregone conclusion that he was a goner.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins, the first ousted houseguest, had ties to a militant
African-American organization, which tainted the meaningful points
he made regarding race, believes Thompson, who says that certain
racial stereotyping seems to be at work on several levels on the
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to take material and in a very short time work it
into a pseudo-documentary,'' he says. ``Editing film is a
fictionalizing machine _ you create characters and conflicts. No
matter how pure their intentions may be, the general prejudices and
biases of the culture have come out. Will `Mega' was presented as
dangerous, somewhat threatening, and aggressively male. They knew
what they were doing with his depiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Cassandra, ``Big Brother's'' other African-American houseguest,
``mitigates Will's depiction somewhat since she's shown as the only
one with her head on her shoulders,'' Thompson says. ``But the fact
that there is no apparent male counterpart for her and her alone is
telling. She's been desexualized by casting, not by her physical
characteristics. She's not considered part of the romantic
equation. Hooking up is not part of her options. That speaks
volumes.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins, after being ousted from the house, complained that the
broadcast episodes offered ``a major imbalance'' in the depiction
of his character. ``You only saw the intense, analytical, debated,
confrontational, argumentative, issue-pressing `Mega.' ... You
didn't see `Mega' who every morning would get up and pray. ... You
didn't see Will `Mega's' poetry.''
</P>
<P>
   Executive producer Paul Romer dismissed Collins' complaint,
saying, ``There are people out there who say this show is boring.
What would be boring is to show the lowlights.'' &QL;

THE GIRLS OF SUMMER 
By Jere Longman. HarperCollins. 318 pp. Illustrated. $24. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a time, Kristine Lilly remembered, when their parents
were their fans, when the US women's soccer team wore men's
uniforms, flew overseas on cargo planes, slept in squalid hotel
rooms, and lived on Snickers bars and Pop-Tarts.
</P>
<P>
   So when Lilly and her teammates walked onto the field a year ago
for the World Cup final and realized that the mammoth Rose Bowl was
filled, they were stunned. ``All I could see was people, a sea of
people,'' Lilly said. ``I could have bawled. We had been waiting
for so long for people to come and watch us.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, when the US women won the Olympic gold medal on home
soil, NBC didn't broadcast the final. Last year, more than 40
million people watched the match live. And after Brandi Chastain
tore off her jersey to celebrate her winning penalty kick against
the Chinese, she ended up on the cover of Time, Newsweek and Sports
Illustrated. ``GIRLS RULE,'' a headline said.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody since the Boys of Winter, the 1980 US Olympic hockey team
that came from nowhere to win the gold medal at Lake Placid,
captured America's imagination the way the Girls of Summer did. And
if they didn't change the world, as author Jere Longman contends,
they undoubtedly changed the way the world perceives their game and
the women who play it.
</P>
<P>
   Most of their World Cup rivals came from countries, particularly
in Latin America and Africa, where it is believed either that
females have no business playing soccer or that they are not worth
watching. Even FIFA, the international soccer federation which
declared that ``the future is feminine,'' had urged that the
tournament be held in small East Coast stadiums in order to
minimize empty seats.
</P>
<P>
   When more than 650,000 people bought tickets to see games from
coast to coast, and 90,000 (including President Clinton) jammed the
Rose Bowl for the final, nobody could deny that the women's game _
at least in the United States _ had come to full flower.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, when the Americans had won the inaugural Cup in China,
they came home to find that nobody but family and friends realized
they had even been playing. Last summer, after watching a Gatorade
commercial in which Mia Hamm judo-flipped Michael Jordan, Buffalo
Bills quarterback Doug Flutie's 10-year-old daughter asked him,
``Who's that guy with Mia?''
</P>
<P>
   Longman, who covered the Cup for The New York Times, does an
admirable job of chronicling how Hamm and her teammates went from
anonymous ponytails to poster women. Using the final match as a
frame-by-frame centerpiece (possibly the best account ever of a 0-0
sporting event), Longman not only traces the evolution of the
women's game but deals with changing perceptions (and lingering
biases) about female athletes in general.
</P>
<P>
   Even after they had won the Cup and filled every venue they
played in (outdrawing even the pope at Giants Stadium), the US
women had to go on strike this year to achieve ``paycheck parity''
with the men's team. And Chastain's exuberant baring of her sports
bra (``A moment of temporary insanity,'' she called it) touched off
a national should-she-or-shouldn't-she-have? debate.
</P>
<P>
   What makes ``The Girls of Summer'' decidedly more than a sports
book is Longman's willingness to tackle complex and controversial
issues like race and sex and gender politics on a global scale.
</P>
<P>
   The disparity between the US team and most of their rivals, as
Longman documents, was stunning. The Ghanaians came from a nation
which still subjects women to ritual genital cutting. The Nigerians
had been told that playing soccer would prevent them from bearing
children. The Brazilians were considered homosexuals by many of
their countrymen. ``We are not big, butch, masculine, lesbian
football players,'' Amy Taylor said last year, after she and her
Australian teammates had posed nude for a calendar.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans, helped by Title IX, had already fought and won
most of those gender battles. Nobody disputed their right to play
and few debated their femininity. ``The US team is Babe City,''
David Letterman proclaimed on his ``Late Show.''
</P>
<P>
   What the World Cup provided them, finally, was center stage and
a spotlight for their ``personality players'': Hamm; Michelle
Akers, their lioness-maned Alpha female; Briana Scurry, their ``big
badass'' goalkeeper; Julie ``Loudy'' Foudy, their outspoken
midfielder; and Chastain, their ``Hollywood'' showtimer.
</P>
<P>
   If the Americans were the tournament's poster women (THIS IS MY
GAME . . . WATCH ME PLAY was the advertising logo), winning the
final was their destiny _ and their reward.
</P>
<P>
   You can't open a champagne bottle while the president is in the
room, a Secret Service agent told Cindy Parlow; a popped cork
sounds like a gunshot. ``Get him out,'' Parlow replied. ``I'm
opening it.''

HOME TRUTHS 
By David Lodge. Penguin. 128 pp. $11.95 (paperback). 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fame can be a toxin posing as an elixir, though in the
post-Camelot age, that in itself is no profundity. David Lodge has
nonetheless chosen to make it the small truth and moral centerpiece
of ``Home Truths,'' which began as a stage play (first produced in
Birmingham in 1998) and here has been reworked and rewired as a
novella. The buff and polish don't much alter the original form:
``Home Truths'' still reads like a script with stage directions,
what with characters closing doors sharply behind them or posing,
front and center, for a moment of dramatic nothingness. This is
odd, and slightly unsettling, but it is still David Lodge _ which
means that, for a hundred-plus brief pages, one has the pleasures
of being in the textual company of one of the funniest
intelligences of contemporary English prose.
</P>
<P>
   Having hurled himself willy-nilly into the American
consciousness with his academic satire, ``Small World,'' and his
deadly on-target novel of neurosis, ``Therapy,'' Lodge is greatly
admired on this side of the Atlantic for being uproarious and wise
simultaneously. In keeping with the recent publishing trend of
milking the cash cow, this scant release comes at the crest of
Lodge's popularity. It will take you longer to park on the way to
procuring ``Home Truths'' than it will to finish the thing, which
should discourage only idealistic readers who still expect heft for
their buck. The rest of us will probably be content with the one or
two moments of splendid humor to be had here, along with the
charming but minor insights about celebrity that the novella
accentuates.
</P>
<P>
   The shuffling-but-noble protagonist is a 50ish fellow named
Adrian Ludlow, a once-heralded novelist who has semi-retired with
his wife, Eleanor, to a forgettable cottage in Sussex. The children
grown, Ludlow's moment in the sun no longer showing a tan line, he
now spends his days editing anthologies _ ``The Paragon Book of
Cricket Writing'' was a recent accomplishment. (Ellie, as Adrian
fondly calls her, seems only to read the Sunday papers in cotton
gloves and make saucy comments, a depiction that further diminishes
``Home Truths'' into a drawing-room drama.) In sharp contrast to
the Ludlows' pastoral quiet is their old friend Sam Sharp, a TV
screenwriter whose bank account far exceeds his creative gifts, or
at least his use of them. Having fallen for the shimmer of his
image in the reflecting pool, Sharp has given an interview to the
notorious Fanny Tarrant of the Sentinel Review _ a journalist whose
reputation has been made by the spike-heel marks she's left on her
subjects' backs. Sick with regret at Tarrant's published
revelations (among them his toupee), Sharp cooks up a plot to
extract revenge _ which, served cold, will wind up poisoning
everyone at the table.
</P>
<P>
   Appealing to his friend's vulnerable ego, Sam persuades Adrian
to pretend to give an interview to Tarrant; in fact, he'll be
taping her, then publishing his own story in a competing tabloid.
Feigning indifference but in fact longing for his own day back on
center stage, Adrian agrees; Ellie, who seems to have been the sane
conscience of these three since their school days, finds the whole
enterprise dangerous and absurd. She's right, of course: From the
moment Tarrant arrives, bearing her Sony tape recorder and sweetly
ruthless focus, we can see where this morality play is headed.
Tarrant will be the devil who appeals to each of their vanities _
the antagonist who makes them all worse, then better, than they
thought they could be.
</P>
<P>
   Theatrically, there's something strangely old-fashioned about
``Home Truths'' _ it bears tones of midcentury realism, when good
and evil knocked each other about in the ring until only epiphany
was left standing. The story's not-so-surprising surprise ending
doesn't translate so well to America as it must have played in
England; celebrity is a messy business everywhere, but with our
shrines and icons of vulgarity, we thought of it first and worst.
Thus we may be harder to shock and dismay: The somber, fallen honor
crawling around onstage at the close of ``Home Truths'' can't help
looking a bit ingenuous from these shores. But then privacy and
good intentions mean something different in the motherland, where
Buckingham Palace and Fleet Street still coexist, with each still
dependent upon the kindness of the other.

MOVIES RECENTLY REVIEWED IN THE BOSTON GLOBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
!!! 1/2 ``Alice and Martin'' Underrated French director Andre
Techine scores again with this tempestuous drama centering on a
woman (Juliette Binoche) who stands by her stressed-out man and
puts things to rights by plunging into his twisted family's
secrets. (R) 
 
!!! ``The Eyes of Tammy Faye'' Documentarians Randy Barbato and
Fenton Bailey may have come to jeer Tammy Faye Bakker and her
trademark cow-catcher eyelashes. But she charms her way past some
high kitsch levels until they wind up genuflecting to her toughness
and survival skills in the cutthroat world of televangelism and
celebrity. (PG-13) 
 
! ``Hollow Man'' This invisible-man thriller should have been an
inaudible-man thriller. Every increasingly ludicrous line defeats
hubristic scientist (Kevin Bacon, above) and lab-coated antagonist
(Elisabeth Shue). Claude Rains did it better in 1933. (R) 
 
!! 1/2 ``Saving Grace'' More amiable than original, this village
comedy set in Cornwall stars Brenda Blethyn as a nice widow, warmly
regarded by the townspeople, who unite in complicity to keep the
law off her neck as she tries to rid herself of debts by growing
marijuana. (R) 
 
!! 1/2 ``Space Cowboys'' Geezers in zero gravity. Clint Eastwood
stars as an astronaut who comes out of retirement with former
teammates Tommy Lee Jones, James Garner, and Donald Sutherland
because they're the only ones who remember the antique technology
necessary to fix up This Old Space Station. The heroics kick in,
but, like the astronauts, it all takes a while to get going.
(PG-13) 
 
!!! `Train Birds'' A winning, warm-hearted, low-key German comedy
about a shy railroad-timetable fanatic who discovers _ with the
help of a rose-fancying woman he meets on a train _ that the
fastest route sometimes isn't the best way to get where you want to
go. (Unrated)

TAYMOR'S AMBITIOUS TAKE ON `TITUS ANDRONICUS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW RELEASES: ``Titus'' (DVD) _ Julie Taymor's ambitious
interpretation of Shakespeare's ``Titus Andronicus'' features
fascinating performances by Anthony Hopkins and Jessica Lange. But
its dependence on idiosyncratic sets, emphasizing the supposed
timelessness of its situations, makes it look more like
``Caligula.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Holy Smoke'' _ This odd movie with Kate Winslet, as a convert
to a cult, and Harvey Keitel, as the professional hired to
deprogram her, is best known for Winslet's frontal nude scene. Too
bad. Although Jane Campion's film has clunky moments and the story
line is not fully realized, the intellectual underpinnings are
ambitious. Raising questions about who really needs to be
deprogrammed is at the core of this intermittently compelling
movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Beatles Collection'' (DVD) _ The four-disc set includes
``Help,'' ``Magical Mystery Tour,'' ``The Making of a Hard Day's
Night,'' and a documentary on the Beatles' first US visit. The
sound quality is excellent on ``Help,'' but the others suffer
because the original soundtrack recordings are inferior.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DVD OF THE WEEK: ``My Dog Skip'' _ Frankie Muniz, of ``Malcolm
in the Middle'' TV fame, and a few Jack Russell terriers make the
adaptation of the late Willie Morris's paean to his boyhood pet the
summer version of ``A Christmas Story.'' Filled with the right
mixture of honest sentiment and childhood cruelty, the film is a
tearjerker that earns every sob. Except for the stringy soundtrack,
which tends to trivialize key moments, it's a marvelous evocation
of a Mississippi remembered through rose-colored glasses. The DVD
is special because of the alternate track in which Muniz explains
that the primary dog actor is the son of the terrier that plays
Eddie on ``Frasier'' _ and that the older dog (who plays Skip in
his declining years) didn't get along with his son, so that they
had to be separated. The detailed description of dog training for
the movies is superb, and only increases your appreciation of this
wonderful little picture.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   COMING ATTRACTIONS: Aug. 15: ``Erin Brockovich'' (DVD), ``It's
the Rage,'' ``Grey Owl,'' ``The Big Brass Ring,'' ``Ghost Dog''
(DVD). Aug. 22: ``The Tigger Movie'' (DVD), ``Mifune.''

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Somebody take my money, please.
</P>
<P>
   It all started after the Napster rulings: First a federal judge
shut down the digital music-swapping service, and then an appeals
court stayed the decision. It seemed like a good time to try
Napster alternatives, from programs like Scour Exchange and
Gnutella to relatively untested pay-to-download services that are
starting to emerge from the major record labels.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say upfront that I was willing to pay to play. But nobody
seemed to want to take my (employer's) money.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Blame Canada. But I'll get to that later.
</P>
<P>
   So what to buy? Sony was the first major record label to get
into the digital download business, in May, when it began offering
50 tracks at several online venues, including www.sonymusic.com.
EMI launched a more aggressive offering two weeks ago, selling
digital download versions of 200 singles and 100 albums on the
Internet. And last week, Universal announced plans to sell 60 songs
on a dozen affiliate Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   I decided on David Bowie's ``The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust
and the Spiders From Mars'' (from EMI). After all, Bowie is an
Internet legend in his current incarnation. He was recently honored
at the Yahoo Internet Life! Online Music Awards in New York, and at
53, he looked and sounded so great it made you wonder if there was
an aging picture of him hidden somewhere in a closet next to a
painting of Dorian Gray.
</P>
<P>
   I started my quest at the established online music outlets.
First stop, Amazon.com. They had Bowie CDs, but no digital
downloads. Ditto for CDNow.com. Just for kicks, I ordered the
$13.99 CD from Amazon, paying an extra $9.98 for overnight
delivery. More on that later.
</P>
<P>
   Next stop was HMV.com, which features a prominent link to the
EMI downloads right on the home page. Progress! Two clicks later,
and I was ready to make my purchase. Well, sort of. First, you have
to register for the site, filling out the usual statistics. Then
you have to follow ``Four Easy Steps,'' which include downloading a
program called the Music License Manager and the latest version of
the Windows Media Player. Easy enough, if somewhat time-consuming.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I bought the album for $13.99. But when I tried to get
my music, the site kept telling me that I couldn't access my
``digital wallet'' until I downloaded the Music License Manager and
the Windows Media Player.
</P>
<P>
   After several hours of repeating the ``Four Easy Steps'' about
four dozen times, I called the help line. A very pleasant customer
service representative puzzled with the problem for a minute and
asked, ``Are you outside Canada?'' Well, yes. ``We're not allowed
to sell the downloads to people outside Canada.'' Why? ``It has
something to do with the licensing.''
</P>
<P>
   So there you have it: Blame Canada.
</P>
<P>
   By this point, I decided to see how long it took to download the
album on Scour Exchange, a Napster clone that is also under fire
from the music industry. It took all of five minutes to locate,
download, and install the software; within 20 minutes, I had MP3
copies of all 11 tracks on the album. I then downloaded Gnutella
and installed the program with relative ease. But the controversial
program doesn't work automatically, like Napster or Scour. Since it
doesn't have a central server, you have to know the address of a
computer already hooked up to the network. D'oh! I finally got an
address from one of the Gnutella sites and did a search for Bowie.
Hours later, I downloaded a copy of ``Suffragette City,'' not
exactly the most efficient way to acquire music. Gnutella, needless
to say, is not likely to become the next big consumer application
any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   But I still really wanted to pay for the album, which led me to
VirginJamcast.com. A few minutes later, I was ready to buy all
tracks for $12.23. Click . . . crash. Every time I tried to buy the
album, my browser crashed. I kept getting the message ``This
program has performed an illegal operation.'' But I was trying to
pay! I wasn't breaking the law! After a few hours and six computer
crashes, I gave up and sent an e-mail off to Virgin customer
service. The next day, I traded several e-mails with a techie named
Michael Griggs, who said that my trouble was probably due to the
fact that I was using Netscape and not Microsoft's Internet
Explorer. I tried Explorer, and bingo, I finally bought my digital
music, a day and a half later. Griggs cheerfully sent me on my way:
``Thanks, and have a great day.''
</P>
<P>
   But who are we kidding here? Even if Napster and Scour were shut
down, nobody in their right mind would spend this much time and
frustration trying to buy digital music online. Lawsuits and
copyright issues aside, the music industry isn't anywhere near
creating a system that customers will embrace; heck, it's hard
enough trying to get them to take your money.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon, of course, has earned a good reputation for delivering
the goods. But the CD I ordered didn't arrive the next day. When I
called, an Amazon employee politely explained that sometimes
overnight orders actually take two days; the company also refunded
the overnight charge. But for reasons unclear at press time, the
package still hasn't arrived on my desk. UPS says it was dropped
off at the Globe, but it hasn't been seen since.
</P>
<P>
   So much for Internet shopping.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in the middle of all this high-tech hassle, I got in my
car and drove to Newbury Comics in Harvard Square. I quickly
located the Bowie section, plunked down my credit card for the
album, and walked away satisfied. It was all so 20th century and
simple _ unless you count the truck that cut me off when I was
trying to park. But that's another story entirely.

TAPESTRIES FIT FOR AN EMPEROR 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MECHELEN, Belgium _ Like Linus, the Peanuts character who lugged
his blanket everywhere, Charles V took his textiles on his travels.
Only he couldn't simply toss them over his shoulder. The nine
tapestries in his monumental series called ``Los Honores'' average
25 to 30 feet in length. When you're the Holy Roman Emperor,
though, limits on carry-on baggage needn't apply.
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 coincides with the 500th anniversary of the birth
of Charles V, who became emperor at age 19 and who at one point
ruled over territory from Hungary to Peru. Peripatetic, he made 40
foreign journeys during his reign, to points as distant as North
Africa. ``Los Honores'' often went with him, to hang in whatever
palace he happened to occupy. ``Portable frescoes,'' the tapestries
were called.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the celebration of Charles's 500th is the restoration of
``Los Honores,'' which is on view in this lovely Flemish town
through Oct. 8, after which it returns to Spain, the country that
actually owns it. There it will hang in newly created quarters in
the splendor of the Royal Palace in Madrid. It's here, after
considerable diplomatic and financial wrangling between the two
countries, because this is where Charles V grew up, under the
guidance of Margaret of Austria, his aunt. (He couldn't be brought
up by his own mother, Joanna of Castile, because she was both crazy
and, before her final lock-up, preoccupied with trotting her
husband's corpse around Spain.)
</P>
<P>
   The tapestries are also here because this is where they were
restored, at the world-famous De Wit Royal Manufacturers, which the
public can visit. The restoration took a year and wasn't simple. De
Wit had to develop 70 different shades of yellow to match the
different hues already present in the works, so that holes and bare
spots being filled in wouldn't jump out at you visually.
</P>
<P>
   History has been as unkind to Charles as he was to many of his
subjects. He's been accused of bribing and extorting his way to
power. In trying to finance an attempt to stamp out Martin Luther's
Reformation by imposing crushing taxes on Spain, he alienated all
concerned. He was particularly loathed in the proud Flemish city of
Ghent, even though he was born there. Feelings about him in Ghent
still run so high that, although there is a Charles V Street, the
statue of him that once stood there has been removed to a more
remote locale.
</P>
<P>
   Ghent refused Charles the money he wanted to wage war, and he
punished the city by demolishing its Abbey of St. Bavo. He
humiliated prominent citizens by having them beg for mercy while
barefoot and wearing nooses around their necks. Within the thick
walls of Ghent's old castle is a torture museum, filled with the
sort of knickknacks Charles's henchmen would have used:
thumbscrews, fingernail smashers, wrought-iron pin-studded collars,
racks for stretching people while blocking their nostrils and
pouring ice water down their throats.
</P>
<P>
   Did I mention that Charles's entourage commissioned ``Los
Honores'' to illustrate the various virtues desirable in a ruler?
Faith, honor, prudence, and justice are among the noble qualities
the tapestries represent; they're a guide to good behavior.
</P>
<P>
   In his attempt to conquer the universe, Charles was never
universally loved. So in the foreword to the tome that resulted
from a high-powered scholarly conference on Charles in Brussels
last year, Cas Goossens, chairman of the Flemish Charles V 2000
Committee, wrote that ``as a consequence of the controversy
surrounding Charles V's character, the committee opted to celebrate
not the man but his era.'' Take that.
</P>
<P>
   Charles was born in Belgium, died in Spain, and spent much of
his life commuting between the two. Thousands of art and history
buffs will retrace his routes this summer, as both countries host
exhibitions and events to mark what the Charles V Committee so
delicately calls ``his era.'' During a recent European trek I
checked out as many Chuck sites as I could fit into a tight
schedule. Mechelen, with the tapestries, was the high point, but
there were also surprises like Yuste, in southern Spain, the
middle-of-nowhere Hieronymite monastery Charles chose as his Golden
Age retirement home. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tapestry central &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spain may own ``Los Honores,'' but the tapestries were made in
Brussels. What Detroit is to cars and Seattle is to computers,
Brussels was to 16th-century tapestry making. In the year of
Charles's birth, 15,000 of the 40,000 people living in the Belgian
city worked in the tapestry industry. The labor was slow going: A
weaver who worked all day without taking a break could complete a
patch about the size of his hand. Brussels tapestries were
celebrated for their brilliant hues. And with the 1517 arrival in
Brussels of Raphael's cartoons for the ``Acts of the Apostles,'' a
papal commission to be woven in the workshop of Pieter van Aelst,
Renaissance style arrived as well. Classical architecture and
perspective started turning up in tapestries. To accommodate the
new sophistication of imagery came new technical sophistication,
including the increase of the number of warp threads from 7 to 12
per centimeter. This allowed for such subtle effects as depicting
the transparency of water.
</P>
<P>
   A stunning exhibition that shows this evolution is in Brussels's
newly and splendidly restored St. Michael's Cathedral through
September, in honor of the Charles V anniversary. It stars the
so-called Golden tapestries, which, like ``Los Honores,'' were made
in Belgium but are part of the patrimony of Spain. They literally
and figuratively weave together biblical stories and stories of
Charles's family. (My favorite is an ``Annunciation'' with God
sending the news to the Virgin in a letter instead of via the more
common dove: a FedEx instead of carrier pigeon.)
</P>
<P>
   The ``Magna Aula,'' the room in the 12th-century Brussels palace
where Charles abdicated in favor of his son, Philip II, has also
just been reopened. It's underground: Brussels's medieval palace
complex was intentionally demolished to make way for a neoclassical
ensemble erected over the rubble. Those in search of more art from
Charles's era should visit the carved wooden retables in Brussels's
Cinquantenaire Museum, which are studies in horror. One shows St.
George being burned alive, beheaded, beaten, suspended upside down
with his hair set on fire, and otherwise having a tough time. If
you can get past the gore, the carving itself, by an anonymous
artist, is dazzling.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of tourist Brussels is its Grand'Place, one of
Europe's most ornate squares, ringed by gabled guild houses and the
Gothic Town Hall, whose stained glass and floor tiles are full of
Charles V's coats of arms and the double-headed eagle that
represented the Hapsburgs. Charles was as eager as a Donna Karan or
Ralph Lauren to stamp his logos on anything and everything. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Nine-part masterpiece &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before the show here, I'd never been a big tapestry fan. ``Los
Honores'' was a revelation, like encountering the high drama of
Rembrandt's ``Night Watch'' after you've yawned your way past other
Dutch civil militia portraits.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition represents the only time all nine of ``Los
Honores'' have been publicly exhibited outside Spain. One of the
world's greatest tapestry cycles, they, like the ``Acts of the
Apostles,'' were woven in van Aelst's workshop. The exact details
of their commission are lost, despite reams of scholarly research
on them. Charles's court probably commissioned them and provided a
down payment _ which proved insufficient to keep van Aelst afloat.
Deeply in debt, he had to hand them over to his bankers for several
years. Because Charles himself wasn't exactly flush _ his money
went for war _ he couldn't afford to buy them outright until 1526,
when he journeyed to Seville to marry the fabulously rich Isabella
of Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Honores'' currently hangs in Mechelen's A. Spinoy Cultural
Center, the only climate-controlled space in town big enough to
hold it. The content of the tapestries is as monumental as their
scale. In all, 336 individuals appear in them, their names woven
into the fabric. Most are mythological characters from ancient
authors like Ovid and Petrarch.

 MECHELEN, Belgium: ... and Petrarch.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everything about the exhibition is exquisitely done and
visitor-friendly, starting with the introductory video on the
tapestries' restoration, with before-and-after views that show how
filthy they were. (In the palace of La Granja near Segovia, their
former home, they were not only dirty but badly lit: You could
argue that no one's really seen them properly for a century or
more.)
</P>
<P>
   Inside the show, there's a window cut into a wall so you can see
the back of one tapestry, which is a mass of tangled threads, a
fascinating contrast with the meticulous front. The excellent
catalog by Guy Delmarcel is available in English. There's a superb
audio guide that virtually everyone but a scholar like Delmarcel
would be lost without. It comes in several languages, including
English, and if you listen to every bit of it, it takes an hour and
a half. (It's the random-access kind, so you can pick and choose.)
</P>
<P>
   The tapestries themselves are quintessential cases of horror
vacuui, crammed not only with figures but with elaborate
architectural settings. The subjects _ ``Fortune,'' ``Prudence,''
``Virtue,'' ``Faith,'' ``Honor,'' ``Fame,'' ``Justice,''
``Nobility,'' and ``Infamy'' _ are complex allegories, mixing
Christian and classical themes. The figures are dressed in
Renaissance attire, the equivalent of Shakespeare in modern dress.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, the works dazzle, suggesting sumptuous textures
including marble, wood grain, ermine, and satin. However crowded,
the compositions are also supremely graceful, and the gestures of
the individual figures read as authentic and compelling. The use of
gold thread is so liberal the tapestries shimmer. (The gold came
dearly: Each tapestry cost half what Charles would pay for a
galleon.)
</P>
<P>
   In ``Fortune,'' the blindfolded goddess scatters roses with one
hand and stones with the other, illustrating the unpredictability
of fate. By the time you get to ``Virtue,'' Fortune has been tamed,
chained between Temperance and Fortitude. Temperance wears a bridle
in her mouth and holds a clock, indication that she speaks
moderately and organizes her time well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faith'' is, by contemporary standards, politically incorrect.
She holds Moses' tablets and the model of a church, while trampling
on Mohammed, who is cast as both infidel and military threat.
``Honor'' conducts a tribunal, with the righteous decorously
ascending to the podium as sinners try in vain to claw their way
up.
</P>
<P>
   On the right-hand side of ``Infamy,'' the final work and one
that uses Cain's murder of Abel as metaphor for all the sin of the
world to come, sits a figure identified as ``Author.'' He's
presumably the man who has written the whole program of the series.
He's just blown out his candle, which is still smoking. His labor,
which has resulted in one of history's most majestic and ambitious
tapestry cycles, is finished. His identity is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Los Honores'' stands to have a great economic impact on
this city, residents are hardly Charles-boosters, fully aware that
the emperor often failed to follow the guidance the tapestries lay
out so vividly. A student art show in the Minderbroeders Church,
coinciding with the ``Los Honores'' exhibition, includes a big,
gridded collage that combines the faces of Charles V, Chilean
dictator Augusto Pinochet, and Pope Pius XII, who failed to oppose
the Nazis publicly during World War II. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Charles's imprint &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Charles ruled Spain, but spent more time out of the country than
in it. But signs of his presence there abound. Madrid's Prado
Museum, for instance, owns an abundance of portraits of Charles and
his family, their trademark horsey Hapsburg faces staring out at
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Hapsburg-ized existing architecture in Spain, making the
buildings blocky and big, and adding slate roofs. His Spanish
capital was Toledo, an austere city atop a mammoth granite
escarpment: On one of its main gates is the double-headed eagle.
(The major traveling ``Charles V'' exhibition that opened in Ghent
and is in Vienna through Sept. 10 then moves to Toledo's Museo de
Santa Cruz.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1557, the year before his death, Charles was carried over the
mountains of Estremadura in a coffinlike litter that is still on
display at his final destination, the monastery of Yuste. His
modest suite of rooms at Yuste is cool and dark; among the original
furnishings is a chair built with an extended footrest to ease his
gout. His bedroom opens onto the high altar of the church, so he
could stay in bed and see and hear Mass. After he died, he was
buried under the altar, as he'd commanded. He'd meant to stay in
this small stone church for eternity.
</P>
<P>
   But 17 years after his death, son Philip had Charles's body
moved to the stark grandeur of the new El Escorial Monastery, 30
miles from Madrid. A vast rectangle with 16 courtyards, it was
modeled after the grill on which San Lorenzo was martyred. Cheerful
it's not. Among its glories is its barrel-vaulted, fresco-covered
library, repository of 40,000 rare books and manuscripts. Among its
grimmest and gaudiest interior spaces is the round marble crypt
whose walls are lined with elaborate bronze and marble sarcophagi
on shelves, a scene that reminded me of the slots-with-beds that
Japanese businessmen rent when they're too tired to make it home.
In the sarcophagi are buried the kings of Spain _ including Charles
V, who, for all his might while alive, wasn't allowed to remain in
the ``final'' resting place he chose.

THE UNLIBERAL CHRIS ROCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS C. PALMER JR.  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He's ``bigger and blacker.'' He's funnier than ever. But, for a
prominent member of the entertainment community in America today,
he's got some unorthodox political views.
</P>
<P>
   That Chris Rock speaks with the authority of a star is beyond
dispute. He went huge in 1996 with the Home Box Office special
``Bring the Pain.'' Now he's got a regular HBO gig, not to mention
his occasional appearances on ``Saturday Night Live,'' from which
he graduated. Last year, HBO broadcast his latest blockbuster
hourlong show from the legendary Apollo Theater in New York, and
has been replaying it frequently since.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bigger and Blacker'' is profane, adult-only material that is
convulsively funny and, regarding racial and cultural divisions
within the country, extraordinarily perceptive.
</P>
<P>
   Rock's views are also _ as he has alternately resisted or
grudgingly acknowledged in interviews _ not only politically
incorrect but also very un-liberal.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a slithery black Ralph Lauren suit, Rock opens the
show saying he is terrified of going into white suburban high
schools these days because he's afraid of getting shot. What's
wrong with these young white kids? He's perplexed that pundits
wonder what music those kids have been listening to, what movies
they've seen.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the music and movies, he says (or words to that effect).
``Whatever happened to `crazy'?'' he demands. ``Did we eliminate
the word `crazy' from the dictionary?''
</P>
<P>
   Now there's a concept: holding individuals responsible for their
own harmful acts and antisocial behavior _ rather than blaming
society, the media, and the low self-esteem that society has
allegedly inflicted on them.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the conservative agenda of Chris Rock.
</P>
<P>
   There are lots of other examples, but first a word of caution.
The language in Rock's show is not something you would associate
with conservatives, or polite liberals either. Unless perhaps
you're referring to the extreme libertarian variety, those who
would preach that everybody should pretty much set his or her own
rules.
</P>
<P>
   Having watched ``Bigger and Blacker'' several times, I couldn't
bring myself to do it again just to count the offensive words. But,
in the first 10 minutes, I counted the S-word five times, the
MF-word once, and the F-word 33 times. I let the H-words and the
A-words go.
</P>
<P>
   Rock is not running for president, and the people who go to his
shows or listen on cable TV know what they're getting. His is a
street-language schtick that is entirely in the tradition of club
comics, especially those deconstructors of existing mores such as
Lenny Bruce or George Carlin. Or, for that matter, most of the rap
music groups performing today.
</P>
<P>
   The language, in fact, may be just outrageous enough to make
those conservative ideas of Rock's palatable to some who might
otherwise dismiss them. Like his view of the behavior of some
single moms.
</P>
<P>
   What are they doing ``in a club at 2 in the morning on a
Wednesday night?'' Rock asks. ``Go take care of those kids before
they rob me in 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Or: ``If the kid calls the grandma Mom and the mommy Pam, the
kid's going to jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Rock's views of the state of male-female relations today is
wickedly frank. Reducing almost everything to sex, he blames
Hillary Clinton more than the president for the Monica Lewinsky
scandal _ for, shall we say, not being there when Bill needed her.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of this is just for laughs, of course. It's comedy, not
Poli-Sci 101. But at its core, a surprising amount of his on-stage
rant, if distilled into serious public policy, would please the
right and offend the left.
</P>
<P>
   Rock started down this road in his controversial 1996 HBO
special, when he addressed the use of the N-word, the way it is
employed by some blacks. ``A black man that got two jobs, going to
work every day, hates a (expletive) on welfare. `Get a job! I got
two. You can't get one?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Asked by the Commercial Appeal newspaper of Memphis since then
whether he wasn't showing Republican stripes, Rock said, ``I'm no
puppet for anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a Pittsburgh Post-Gazette interview, he had bought at
least partway into the description. Asked whether he wasn't
``pretty conservative,'' Rock said, ``I'm not really political . .
. in a political sense, but in a social sense maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   Isn't ``social'' right where a lot of conservative concerns rest
today?
</P>
<P>
   And he told the San Diego Union-Tribune that, on core
conservative issues of law and order, family values, and individual
responsibility, ``I consider these to be common-sense issues. These
are not black and white isues, liberal or conservative issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Just because you don't put the conservative label on yourself
doesn't mean you don't hold those beliefs. Rock seems to dislike
the term because he doesn't like the way either established
political party addresses race.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with Democrats is that they treat us like we're
kids,'' Rock told the Union-Tribune. ``But the Republicans really
don't give a (expletive) about us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In my humble opinion,'' he concluded, ``most working-class
blacks are very conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to race and ethnic issues, he adopts the position
of enlightened conservatives _ not the anti-immigrant wing _ and
teaches inclusion, tolerance, and love.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make sense to hate nobody,'' Rock advises.
``Whoever you hate will end up in your family. You don't like
Puerto Ricans? Your daughter will come home `Livin' La Vida
Loca'!''
</P>
<P>
   If congressman Rick Lazio stumbles between now and November, the
New York GOP may want to consider Rock as a Senate candidate,
considering his stand on taxes. ``One thing Clinton did I didn't
like _ raise taxes,'' he says. ``You don't even `pay' taxes. They
`take' taxes. You get your paycheck _ they're gone. That ain't a
payment, that's a `jack.' As in `hijack.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Rock is shrewd enough and funny enough, and now successful
enough, that he can even take on America's black leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need a new leader,'' he says. ``We ain't had a
black leader in a while _ somebody that moves you.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, and ever since then, a
bunch of substitute teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   Rock says the problem with Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam
leader, is that nobody's ever been in a barber shop and heard black
people sitting around talking about disliking Jews. ``You know who
I think the black leader should be?'' Rock says. ``Pat Riley. Coach
Pat Riley. No man has led more black men to the promised land than
Coach Pat Riley.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there's another person out there that nobody's thought of.
He's a 34-year-old black comedian who seems to be in touch with a
lot of black people, if not with most of the Hollywood and black
political establishment.
</P>
<P>
   He'd have to do something about that language first.

DEBATE BETRAYS ANGER, UNCERTAINTY OVER GIRLS `FAVORED' STATUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ABEL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The debate has sent academics into on-air tirades, pitted
conservatives against liberals with increasing venom, and unleashed
a storm of shrill sparring around the country.
</P>
<P>
   It's the next chapter of the gender wars: the battle over
whether feminist academics, upset over a longstanding bias against
girls, have managed to tilt the balance so far that today's focus
on girls has come at the expense of boys.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives see evidence everywhere. Exhibit A: In 1999, the
Columbine High School massacre became the defining event for boys,
while the World Cup victory of the US women's soccer team
symbolized the spirit of the nation's girls.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the academic attack is Christina Hoff Sommers, an
anti-feminist philosophy professor at Clark University in
Worcester, a fellow at a conservative Washington think tank, and
mother of two boys. Throwing down the gauntlet in her new book,
``The War Against Boys,'' she mows down a host of academics she
charges with imposing girls' values on boys, engaging in shoddy
scholarship, and confusing a thesis with reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have always been societies that favored boys over
girls,'' Sommers said in an interview promoting her book. ``Ours
may be the first to deliberately throw the gender switch by
preferring girls. Little boys have become politically incorrect. .
. . Our society wars against boys when it views and treats the
normal behavior of young boys as wrong and in need of curing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sommers cites a raft of statistics to support her view that boys
have not enjoyed academic favoritism. They include that boys trail
girls in reading and writing, girls take more Advanced Placement
tests than boys and more frequently enroll in college, and girls
read more books and outperform boys in art and music tests.
</P>
<P>
   Her critics say Sommers falls victim to many of her own charges.
They consider her academic sniping crude and misleading, her
conclusions akin to historical revisionism, and her work a harsh
diatribe that does little more than expand on her previous
feminist-thrashing book, ``Who Stole Feminism?: How Women Have
Betrayed Women.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Sommers's main targets is William Pollack, an assistant
professor of clinical psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and
co-director of the Center for Men at McLean Hospital in Belmont,
Mass. Pollack, author of the best-selling ``Real Boys: Rescuing Our
Sons from the Myths of Boyhood,'' agrees with Sommers that boys are
in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But he does not believe that favoring girls accounts for boys'
current difficulties. And, unlike Sommers, who urges society to
encourage boys to be stoic, serious, and what some would call
typically masculine, Pollack prefers boys be liberated from macho
stereotypes and feel free to express their emotions. Sommers argues
that Pollack's prescription for helping boys only hurts them
further because it ``feminizes'' them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is she doesn't know anything about boys, she has
no training in the area,'' Pollack said in an interview. ``The only
way to make boys more feminine is to give them estrogen. I'm not
suggesting that. I'm just trying to remove the gender
straitjacket.''
</P>
<P>
   The two recently squared off on National Public Radio's ``Talk
of the Nation.'' And it didn't take long for the professors to
start swinging.
</P>
<P>
   Sommers: ``I don't think that children need to be liberated from
gender roles . . . (and) I do not like the idea of calling them a
nation of Hamlets or our girls' `drowning Ophelias.' That's
absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollack: ``I haven't called them Hamlets or Ophelias. In fact,
though, I've actually looked at boys . . . in my study in ``Real
Boys . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Sommers: ``Where did you publish this study?''
</P>
<P>
   Juan Williams, the show's host: ``Well, look, I don't want you
two to be snapping at each other. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Pollack: ``I'm not trying to snap at all. I'm trying to talk
about boys. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Sommers: ``No, no. You did call them Hamlets in your book, and
you said they live in an inner state of Denmark. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   The bickering between Sommers and her academic adversaries
carries on into the August edition of The Atlantic Monthly, which
in May published an 11-page excerpt from the ``The War Against
Boys.'' The magazine received more than 100 letters _ both critical
and admiring _ which was more than almost any story in the managing
editor's memory had garnered.
</P>
<P>
   Of those published, the first is from Carol Gilligan, a prolific
author on girls and a gender-studies professor at Harvard's
Graduate School of Education. Sommers dubs her ``the matron saint
of the girl-crisis movement,'' and spends most of her book
attacking Gilligan, criticizing her methods and pounding her ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Gilligan, in her letter to The Atlantic and in a recent
interview, dismisses Sommers's work as more character assassination
than academic acumen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sommers not only is inaccurate but also misses the larger
point and finds controversy where none exists,'' Gilligan writes.
``. . . It's sad that Sommers squanders the opportunity to open a
constructive dialogue on our differences of opinion and
interpretation and chooses instead to publish an inaccurate, ad
hominem attack that can lead nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Another of Sommers's targets is David Sadker, author of
``Failing at Fairness: How America's Schools Cheat Girls.'' Among
other complaints, she takes the American University professor to
task for his ``call-out'' gap study, which found boys in class call
out more often than girls, while girls are more often scolded for
not raising their hand. Sommers accuses Sadker of exaggerating and
distorting the problem. The real issue, she believes, is that boys
are less attentive.
</P>
<P>
   Like Gilligan and Pollack, Sadker suggests Sommers is more
interested in her agenda than the evidence. She ignores a host of
facts showing girls continue to lag behind boys, he says. While
girls have made progress, they continue to trail boys on
college-entry exams, including the SAT, ACT, and GRE, and though
they take more AP tests, they score lower.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although it may serve a political purpose to cast our work as
`boys against girls,' '' he wrote in a letter to The Atlantic,
``the truth is (his wife, a researcher) and I dedicated our
professional lives to battling sexist assumptions that wound both
our daughters and our sons. It is bias we oppose, not boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking the rebuttals in stride, Sommers believes the backlash is
all part of the ebb tide against her anti-establishment views.
</P>
<P>
   She accuses Sadker, Gilligan, and others of belatedly paying
attention to boys' deficiencies, after her book came out. And she
gives short shrift to groups such as the American Association of
University Women, which she believes only now speaks
``ecumenically'' about improving schooling ``for all children.''
</P>
<P>
   If all the back-and-forth seems like nonsense or unnecessarily
incendiary to the public, it doesn't to Pollack or Sommers. While
both believe boys need help, their prescriptions remain at odds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not calling for a revolution,'' Sommers said. ``Gender
equity has tended to mean helping girls. I'm just trying to draw
attention to boys.''

A NEW WAY OF THINKING ABOUT OUR EARLY ADOLESCENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

OUR LAST BEST SHOT 
Guiding Our Children Through Early Adolescence 
By Laura Sessions Stepp. Riverhead Books. 359 pp. $25.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When our children are little, there are scores of books to help
us evaluate and navigate the joys and perils of parenting. The
older they get, however, the more the list of books worth reading
shrinks. No wonder that good ones _ ``Reviving Ophelia,'' ``Real
Boys,'' ``Raising Cain'' _ rise quickly to best-selling status;
we're starved for the sustenance they offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Last Best Shot: Guiding Our Children Through Early
Adolescence,'' by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Laura Sessions
Stepp, belongs on the shelf with them. This book isn't just
well-researched and insightful, it's a page-turner.
</P>
<P>
   Well, OK, maybe only if you have a 10- to 15-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Those five years have always been mysterious and confounding for
parents. Young adolescents are frequently moody and sullen, quick
to lash out for no discernible reason. Add to that the violent,
consumer-driven, anything-goes nature of our times, and being a
parent of a young adolescent is downright scary. Stepp, who writes
about family issues for The Washington Post and has a young teen
herself, acknowledges all this in a tone that is somehow
no-nonsense and sympathetic at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   More than that, she us offers hope.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the stupid things young teens do are things they are
supposed to do, she tells us: They are hard-wired to do them, they
can't help themselves. In other words, it's nothing personal, Mom
and Dad. Recognizing that alone can ease our burden and make us
more open to finding ways to communicate with our child rather than
be stuck in a rut critizing her. Stepp is so confident that we can
help our children come out the other end of these years safely and
sanely that she predicts, ``Our kids will one day become our
friends, unlike any we will ever have.''
</P>
<P>
   (Sigh.)
</P>
<P>
   Sign me up.
</P>
<P>
   Stepp focuses on these years partly because she was stumped by
changes in her own 11-year-old son, partly because her research
showed that the 10- to 15-year-old has needs far different from
those of older adolescents and shouldn't be lumped together in
books about them. (She's not the first to make this distinction;
Charlene C. Giannetti and Margaret Sagarese in ``The Roller-Coaster
Years'' expertly examine these years, too, but with more of a
``how-to'' emphasis.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Last Best'' is divided into four sections that reflect the
overarching, developmental questions the 10- to 15-year-old
grapples with: What kind of person am I? How do I/Do I fit in with
my friends? Am I learning? How can I separate from adults but still
be connected to them?
</P>
<P>
   The topics come alive with the stories of 12 young people Stepp
met and virtually lived with in three refreshingly different but
still representative communities: South Central Los Angeles;
Ulysses, Kan.; and Durham, N.C. These are real people, not
composites (although their real names are not used), and they offer
not only a cross-section of academic performance but also of race,
family structure, and economic background. Don't be put off if you
don't see your child reflected exactly in one individual or
another. There's a good chance you will see a little bit of her
here, a little bit of him there. There were many places where I saw
myself, my husband, or my son, many pages I marked in the margin
with exclamation points so I could return to a particulary
elucidating thought.
</P>
<P>
   How often, for instance, have you heard and used the term ``peer
pressure''? See if you don't undertand it better after reading this
passage: ``Rebekah (a mother) did not say that Libby's friends were
a bad influence. She understood that peer pressure is misnamed,
that teens who drink or smoke usually do not stand over their more
reluctant friends coaxing them to join in. What they do is convey a
sense of fun and relaxation, and the young person who wants the
others to like her, who knows of no other way to unwind, or who
simply wants to try something new and forbidden, may be inclinded
to experiment. . . . Peer pressure, then, is really `me pressure,'
stress the child imposes on herself.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for a blueprint for parenting, complete with
bulleted how-to points, this book will disappoint. (The closest it
comes is a ``To Do'' summary at the end of each chapter.) But Stepp
is not bashful about praising or damning parents of her subjects,
and it is often in these judgments that she helps us dispel
stereotypes that can miscolor our own efforts to rear children. For
instance:
</P>
<P>
   --On hanging out at malls: ``The real problem with shopping
malls is not, as many parents suppose, that other young people will
be there whom the parent may not know, or that kids together get in
trouble.'' What we need to worry about, she writes, are the
``acquisitive, sometimes vulgar values that some stores parade in
front of kids who are just beginning to think about what kind of
people they want to become.''
</P>
<P>
   --On sex: ``Talking about the physical and emotional
implications of sex will not cause a child to run out and
experiment, as many parents fear. Neither will explaining one's own
feelings and values in very specific terms such as `I want you to
wait until you're married.' . . . Kids hate `The Big Talk,' but
they are hungry for good advice on how to say `no' and how to
manage emotional relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   --On getting a job: ``Parents are often reluctant to allow kids
to take outside jobs, either volunteer or for pay, for fear that
their studies will suffer. . . . We need to keep in mind that
collaborating on a job with a responsible adult may do more for a
kid's self-esteem, study habits, and manners than playing a
mediocre game of soccer. Jobs give kids lots of practice at making
decisions in a structured environment. Volunteer work is better for
most kids this age than a paying job and often appeals to their
newfound idealism.''
</P>
<P>
   Lest it sound as if Stepp is simply spouting off, her reporting
is documented throughout, and her conclusions are thoroughly
supported by research she cites in the text and in the extensive
notes and bibliography. Her essential message is not stunning in
its originality. Indeed, we've heard it all before: We need to be
acute listeners and astute observers of our young teens and, most
important, we need to stay in touch with them.
</P>
<P>
   What Stepp does offer is a new way of thinking about our 10- to
15-year-olds, and a new way of thinking about ourselves as parents
of these unique creatures. Staying in touch, for instance, doesn't
mean talking at our teens, which is what passes for communication
in most of our homes (even though we may not realize it), but
talking with them, especially asking them questions in a way that
gets them thinking. It means talking to other people about them: to
their teachers, their coaches, their peers, and the parents of
their peers. And it means showing our values and our thinking not
only through our words, but also through our actions.
</P>
<P>
   For a snapshot of what that means, read the last two pages of
``Our Last Best Shot.'' As the mother of a 12-year-old smack in the
middle of this journey, I found they brought tears to my eyes.

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The seventh-inning stretch is coming up at
Pacific Bell Park and you realize it has been more than two hours
since you last logged in.
</P>
<P>
   Like a left-hander coming in from the bullpen, relief is here.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Friday, San Francisco Giants fans will have limited
access to the Internet at one of five ``Web Stations'' at the park,
making it the first major league baseball stadium in the nation to
provide such a service.
</P>
<P>
   Streetspace Inc., the San Francisco company that last year
installed similar terminals at cafes and shops in Berkeley, put the
sleek little machines in the ballpark to give people access to
e-mail as well as selected sponsor sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are pretty much living on line these days. If there's a
break in the action or people are just walking around, it's a great
way to keep in touch,'' explained Michael Wranovics, vice president
of marketing at Streetspace.
</P>
<P>
   The terminals allow people to check out the San Francisco
Giants' home page, SFGiants.com, as well as the other sponsoring
sites.
</P>
<P>
   It does not give people full access to the Internet but instead
operates as a closed network powered by Pacific Bell's high-speed
digital subscriber line, or DSL.
</P>
<P>
   Wranovics said the stations are not designed for people to spend
long periods of time surfing the Web. The limited Internet access
also restricts people from calling up objectionable material, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The stations, rather, allow people to send or receive mail, make
restaurant reservations or transactions, look at movie schedules or
get other quick bits of information.
</P>
<P>
   While the service is free to users, they must first register
with Streetspace to access the sites. Wranovics said the
registration is for privacy and for the company's internal
information and that the information is not sold or shared with
other parties.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants also do not pay for the Web Stations. The service is
supported by five sponsors. The number of terminals may also be
increased to as many as 30.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Alioto, the Giants' senior vice president of corporate
marketing, said the Giants considered installing ``smart seats,''
or screens on the back of seats that could provide limited Internet
access and other features.
</P>
<P>
   Streetspace's Web Stations offered a less intrusive alternative,
Alioto said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we really wanted to do this is that it adds to the
experience at the ballpark,'' he said. ``It's there if you want it,
but you don't have to go to it. It's just part of the
attractions.''
</P>
<P>
   For Streetspace, which was founded 18 months ago, the deal with
the Giants is something of a coup.
</P>
<P>
   Streetspace has other deals in the works with nationally known
partners, Wranovics said. ``We are basically building an
infrastructure and we plan to build it all over the country,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Stewart O'Nan is in the lobby of the State
Armory, spreading out photographs taken there during the late
afternoon and evening of July 6, 1944. That was when this was the
temporary morgue where people came to identify the bodies of women,
children, and a few men, killed that day when the celebrated ``big
top'' became a deadly firetrap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Circus Fire,'' O'Nan's account of the Hartford circus fire,
has just been published, but after immersing himself in the story
for the past five years, O'Nan has come to regard himself as a
``custodian'' of the memories of survivors and witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   On this day he uses old photographs to plot the route by which
family members, accompanied by a police officer and a nurse, walked
upstairs from the lobby to the drill floor where the bodies of 135
victims had been taken. Another 32 people died at local hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still putting the pieces together,'' O'Nan says. ``That
interest in trying to figure out what happened and how it happened
is still with me.''
</P>
<P>
   On the drill floor, where several young women are setting up
displays for an Italian wine trade show, O'Nan leads the way down
its 269-foot length to the back wall. When family members arrived,
he says, ``they had to walk the whole length, all the way back to
where the bodies were.''
</P>
<P>
   There are several racks of folding chairs against the back wall
and that is where O'Nan talks about the fire and his role as its
custodian. ``We're sitting,'' he says, ``right where the bodies
were laid out.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The fire apparently started in a men's room behind the
grandstand. The cause remains a mystery, but once the fire started,
flames spread quickly up the canvas tent, fueled by its paraffin
waterproofing.
</P>
<P>
   As O'Nan describes those moments, ``Inside, the band played `The
Stars and Stripes Forever' over and over, as if the sound might
calm people knocked through the bleachers or buried under chairs,''
O'Nan writes. The master of ceremonies ``pleaded with the people in
the east end to leave through the side flaps, but they all clotted
helplessly at the bandstand exits. Children fainted in the crush.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the while, the fire was crossing the top of the tent. It
spread like a grass fire, a haystack fire, a giant orange wave.
Central Connecticut residents were familiar with shade tobacco
tents, how a blaze on the sheer canopies could outrun the fastest
man; it was like that.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, rescue workers began removing the bodies.
Brown Thomson's department store sent a delivery van to help move
them to the morgue being set up at the armory. The teenage shipping
room worker, O'Nan writes, remembered that many of the bodies ``lay
on stretchers, uncovered, frozen in grotesque positions.'' A man
told him that ``he'd tried to pick up a body and his hands had gone
through the flesh, right down to the bone. The bone was hot and
he'd burned his hand, jerking back as if he'd touched a hot
stone.''
</P>
<P>
   With his boss, the young worker lifted the bodies into the
truck, then headed downtown to the armory, ``trying not to think of
what was bumping in the back at every turn.''
</P>
<P>
   At the armory, ``searchers wandered solemnly through the cots,
handkerchiefs and ammonia-soaked gauze clutched to their noses.
State troopers in pith helmets and uniformed nurses bracketed them,
ready to step in,'' O'Nan writes. ``All it took was a blackened
piece of jewelry, a missing incisor, an appendectomy scar. One
little girl had cut her palm that morning, and her father had fixed
it with a Band-Aid. Her clenched fist still cupped the bandage.
Otherwise she was unrecognizable, her clothing burned away except
for her black patent leather shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the victims was a young girl, dead, but barely touched by
the flames, who became known as Little Miss 1565 (in reference to
her identification number at the site), who remains unidentified to
this day. Another young girl, a young boy, and three women also
remain unidentified, most likely because misidentified bodies were
buried in their place.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   O'Nan is 39, a Boston University-trained
engineer-turned-novelist. He lives in Avon, just west of Hartford,
with his wife, Trudy _ who was working as a Red Cross disaster
specialist much of the time he was researching the circus fire _
and their two children. It was moving five years ago to teach at
Hartford's Trinity College that spurred him to turn his attention
to the fire.
</P>
<P>
   A decade earlier, while researching his novel ``A World Away,''
O'Nan had come across the searing photograph of the clown Emmett
Kelly, covering his eyes as he lugs a bucket of water across the
circus grounds with a small tent burning in the background.
</P>
<P>
   The image stayed with him and after moving to Avon, O'Nan looked
for a book on the fire only to find there was none, other than
several ``based-on'' novels and a study of lawsuits against the
circus by two Yale Law School professors.
</P>
<P>
   ``That didn't make sense,'' O'Nan recalls thinking. ``So I guess
I ended up writing the book I wanted to read.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he had already written five well-regarded novels, O'Nan
never thought of fictionalizing the story of the circus fire. ``It
had already become a kind of legend, with stories that were
overlapping and contradictory,'' O'Nan says. ``It deserved only the
most stringent, very best intentions of nonfiction.'' Turning the
story into fiction, he felt, might cheapen it.
</P>
<P>
   Having decided that, O'Nan had a model in mind, David
McCullough's ``The Johnstown Flood.'' He admired the account of the
impact of a disaster on a community and also felt a kinship with
McCullough because they attended the same elementary school, albeit
a quarter-century apart, in Pittsburgh's Point Breeze neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to take the same approach as he did,'' O'Nan says.
``I wanted to show the connectedness of history, how it affects
people.''
</P>
<P>
   As O'Nan began researching the story of the circus fire, a
half-century after the tragedy, he quickly discovered that it is
``a story that endures in Hartford.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody seemed to have a memory,'' O'Nan says. ``As I began
talking to people about the fire, it seemed that everybody knew
somebody who had been there.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the survivors were children who would be in their late
50s and early 60s today. ``So I'd have somebody who'd remember that
a neighbor's daughter had burn scars on her legs,'' O'Nan says.
Many of the witnesses, police officers, firefighters, doctors, and
nurses, are still alive.
</P>
<P>
   The effect the fire had on the community was far different from
that of Boston's Cocoanut Grove Fire almost two years earlier. Many
of the nightclub's 492 victims were college students and
servicemen, while virtually all the victims of the circus fire were
local people, with relatives, childhood playmates, and classmates
still living around Hartford today.
</P>
<P>
   Mixed with the memories of tragedy, O'Nan was surprised to find
``a kind of nostalgia,'' he says. ``Not so much for the fire, but
for how the city was back then, how the neighborhoods were.''
</P>
<P>
   Although O'Nan still hears from survivors and witnesses, he is
deep into two new projects. He is ``468 pages into a very long
novel,'' he says, and finishing up another novel set in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I don't have to write nonfiction again for a while,''
he says. ``It's too hard. You can't make stuff up. You can't fake
it. You can't spin it. You have to take it as it is.''

   LIEBERMAN-GORE (Washington) _ In tapping Joseph Lieberman, the
first orthodox Jewish member of the U.S. Senate, as the nation's
first Jewish vice presidential nominee, Al Gore raises many
questions. We look at whether an overwhelmingly Christian
electorate will vote for a non-Christian, whether Lieberman will
help Hillary Clinton in New York and whether his strong criticisms
of President Clinton in the Monica Lewinsky scandal will help Gore.

   JAPAN-SMALL-SHOPS (Machida City, Japan) _ When it comes to
mom-and-pop stores, deregulation in Japan is hitting a roadblock
after a decade of change. Business associations, citizens groups
and ordinary Japanese that sat quietly as deregulation made banking
more convenient, liberalized the sale of gasoline and led to an
explosion in advanced wireless telephones are now rallying as
barriers that protect the shotengai, or local shopping street,
fall. Shopkeepers have traditionally been the backbone of the
Japanese neighborhood. They organize festivals that make the long,
sticky summers here tolerable. They are active in school affairs
and community sports. Shopkeepers lack the financial resources of
big corporations like N.T.T., says Hiroshi Yamada, the mayor of
Suginami ward in Tokyo, ``but the local shop owners can collect
something even more valuable: votes.'' By Stephanie Strom.

&HT;     BALTIMORE'S FIRE SALE BOOSTS OTHER TEAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN SHEA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Baltimore Orioles' 72-hour fire sale will be felt throughout
the pennant races.
</P>
<P>
   They made the Atlanta Braves better by handing over outfielder
B.J. Surhoff. They strengthened the New York Mets by donating
shortstop Mike Bordick. They beefed up the St. Louis Cardinals by
contributing first baseman Will Clark and closer Mike Timlin. They
reinforced the Chicago White Sox by furnishing catcher Charles
Johnson and designated hitter Harold Baines.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles did absolutely nothing for themselves, at least for
this lost season, but the long-term effects are extreme. Not only
did they shed $22.1 million in salaries and gain 14 players, mostly
prospects, mostly marginal, they also did their best to outrage
their two most marketable players.
</P>
<P>
   Cal Ripken Jr. and Mike Mussina may be playing their final weeks
in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, the process saddens me. It really does,'' Ripken told
the Washington Post. ``B.J., you know, I can't help but watch his
emotions and well up and feel all the same emotions he felt _ and
I'm not the one leaving. The friend that he's become, the time
we've spent we've talked about baseball, the years that he's had
here. That's sad. And the process and the harsh realities of the
sport, many moments are very sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Ripken remains undecided about returning next season. He turns
40 this month and is sidelined with back problems. One theory is
the Orioles broke up the team partly to push Ripken into
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Mussina will be a popular free agent after the season and wants
to play for a winner. Baltimore doesn't appear to be the place,
though the Orioles say they're still interested in re-signing the
pitcher and may even increase the payroll back to $80 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to be convinced that this is a place I want to play the
rest of my career,'' Mussina said. ``But when they're trading away
Bordick and Surhoff and Charles Johnson, people who still have very
good years in front of them, I don't find that very convincing.''
</P>
<P>
   It's no secret the Orioles needed a change. They were a group of
former stars going nowhere, destined for mediocrity for a third
straight year. It was grumpy, old, slow team with a war-torn
clubhouse. The remains include Albert Belle and a slew of faceless
Triple-A players.
</P>
<P>
   The blueprint is to resurrect with kids and focus on pitching,
much the way the Braves built themselves in the early '90s. But if
that's the case, and it takes another three years, Ripken and
Mussina can't wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team needs some stability, and I don't know where it
is,'' Mussina said. ``I think it just got traded away. It doesn't
take a genius to figure out they're putting themselves in a
position where they aren't looking to be competitive for a couple
of years. So where does that leave me?''
</P>
<P>
   If not for no-trade clauses in the contracts of Mussina, Belle
and Brady Anderson, they'd probably be gone, too. The Orioles would
love to dump Belle in this rebuilding shuffle, and they're
considering making him a full-time DH, if only to anger him and
have him demand a trade.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Orioles say they'll no longer include no-trade
clauses in contracts.

   The New York Times News Service plans the following  &UR; Science
Times &LR;  stories for papers of Tuesday, Aug. 8:
</P>
<P>
   SCI-NILE-VIRUS (Undated) _ West Nile virus appears to be
settling in for the long haul. More slowly than expected, but
steadily, the mosquito-transmitted virus is dispersing from last
year's focal point in northern Queens in New York, leaving a trail
of dead birds that so far extends north to Boston, west to
Syracuse, and south to Maryland. According to virus experts, this
pattern indicates that West Nile, which was first identified in
Uganda in 1937 and flares up sporadically in Africa, Europe, and
the Middle East, appears ensconced in the New World. Many
scientists expect that a scattering of human infections and a few
deaths may well become the norm in years to come. Still, these
experts say, the disease appears unlikely to become a significant
threat to public health. By Andrew C. Revkin. (2100 words)

   With photos, NYT4,5, and a graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PHYSICS-BIAS (Undated) _ Despite its image of arcane
intellectuality, particle physics is fast becoming a field with
plenty of heart-pounding, high-stakes suspense. The reasons lie not
so much in the field's recent string of discoveries as in how some
of them were made. Several large, multinational teams of particle
physicists, who design experiments to capture, measure and
understand the most elementary building blocks of matter, have
adopted an analysis technique that may best be compared to walking
a tightrope while blindfolded. The problem is bias, and it plagues
all realms of scientific experimentation. Recently, somewhat in the
spirit of biomedicine, research teams in particle physics have been
programming their computers to add unknown numbers, called
``offsets,'' to their data to make the outcome of their analyses
blind. When an experiment is over, the researchers open their
metaphorical sealed envelopes and discover what the value of the
offset is _ learning only then whether they are close to a routine
confirmation of theory, a Nobel Prize or a humiliating mistake. By
James Glanz. (1500 words)
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   SCI-CULTURE-THOUGHT (Undated) _ A series of studies comparing
European Americans to East Asias found people who grow up in
different cultures did not just think about different things, they
also think differently. Easterners appear to think more
holistically, paying greater attention to context and relationship,
relying more on experience-based knowledge than abstract logic, and
showing more tolerance for contradiction. Westerners are more
analytic in their thinking, tending to detach objects from their
context, to avoid contradictions, and to rely more heavily on
formal logic. By Erica Goode. (2000 words)

   SCI-BRENNER-DNA (Undated) _ A conversation With Dr. Charles
Brenner, 55, one of the world's first fully-employed free-lance

</P>
<P>
   SCI-PORTUGAL-DINOSAURS (Lisbon) _ The Portugese government is
acting to protect the country's rich array of dinosaur fossils and
tracks, which are being threatened by erosion and development.
There are at least 20 Jurassic sites with sauropod track ways in
Portugal, along with more than 100 discovered eggs and dinaosaur
fragments. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization, (Unesco) plan on naming a Portuguese site as a
Geoparque, which is a classification created last year for the
protection of natural resources. By Marvine Howe. (1500 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ News and notes on science: Items on the
Asian giant honeybee nest sites which were found to be occupied
year after year by swarms related to the hive, the Hubble Space
Telescope caught the comet Linear literally breaking up early in
July, and researchers had mapped the structure of the protein
rhodopsin, which functions in the retina. By Henry Fountain. (700

<P>
   SCI-PRESBYOPIA (Undated) _ Scientists are still not sure exactly
what causes presbyopia (the inability for eyes to focus up close,
which affects people around the age of 50 and causes them to need
reading glasses) or what might reverse it. And for the last five
years they have been arguing heatedly over the risks and merits of
an experimental surgical procedure, scheral expansion surgery,
that, despite a host of scientific objections, appears to fix it.
By Abigail Zuger, M.D. (1550 words)

   SCI-EYEGLASSES Undated) _ Historians say the first eyeglasses
were probably made by monks. George Washington once paid the
outlandish sum of $75 for a pain with hinges. And other facts and

   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ The Personal Health column:
Contrary to widespread belief, irritable bowel syndrome is a real

   SCI-TESTES-CANCER (Undated) _ The Cases column: A young man with
testicular cancer, which is the most common solid tumor in men aged
15 to 34. The incidence has been rising worldwide, and in the
United States 7,000 to 8,000 new cases are diagnosed every year.
Like most cancers, it used to be a death sentence; today, with
advances in chemotherapy, it has a cure rate of 90 percent. By
Sandeep Jauhar (880 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ News and notes on health and
fitness:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Circulation journal reports today that blacks who have had
heart attacks are less likely to receive proven treatments to
prevent a recurrence, even when they are as inexpensive as aspirin
or beta-blockers. While the researchers said they did not believe
there was conscious discrimination, they said more study was needed
to determine why the disparities occurred. Racial disparities in
medical treatment have increasingly become an issue in medicine,
and numerous studies have documented its incidence and its causes.
(250 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Researchers believe doctors are routinely overlooking broken
wrists in women over 55 as a first sign of osteoporosis. These
findings suggest that doctors need to be diligent about making sure
postmenopausal patients being treated for wrist breaks received
good follow-up evaluations. (275 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ In the current Annals of Neurology, researchers have found
that when a child has seizures more than once, the diagnosis
probably is epilepsy. Seventy percent of children who have a second
seizure go on to have more. Knowing this may help doctors decide
whether long-term medication, despite the potential for side
effects, may be appropriate. (225 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ A patient experiencing tearing, congestion and a drooping eye
(which are normally associated with cluster headaches) but had no
headache has caused doctors to believed that these are symptoms in
their own right and not just responses to pain. (230 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ A recent study from Johns Hopkins University suggests that the
mere act of breathing deeply may stretch lung tissue and cause the
release of a protective chemical that keeps the airways open. If
this chemical could be identified, researchers believe it could be
the basis of a new asthma drug. (180 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ A science question answered: How is the heat
of hot peppers measured; either through human testers or by the
amount of Capsaicin in the pepper. By C. Claiborne Ray. (300 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CHILD-CAR-SEATS (Undated) _ Researchers who analyzed car
crashes report that many parents are not using child car seats and
booster seats correctly. A recommended test for a properly
installed car seat, is that it should not move more than one inch
in any direction after being pulled forward and from the sides.

   It could be every bit as dramatic as the revolution that hit the
world's telecommunications industry in the 1980s. And it is
occurring in an unexpected business; but one in which can be seen
the same forces of innovation, competition and choice that
transformed yesterday's sleepy telephone monopolies into today's
high-tech predators. That business is electricity generation.
Stifle your yawns _ power is every bit as big a business as
telecoms. Indeed, America's $220 billion electricity market is
larger than those for cellular and long-distance telephony
combined. &QL;

better chance of survival. The process of consolidation will have
profound effects, some beneficial but some harmful, on all European

   MINNEAPOLIS _ The Democratic Party's campaign planners rarely
lose sleep over Minnesota. The state's voters have chosen Democrats
in all but three presidential elections since 1948, and in all the
six most recent ones. But this land of fishermen and Scandinavian
crypto-socialists is no longer a bastion of the Democratic
Farmer-Labor Party (as the Minnesota branch still insists on
calling itself). Recent polls put Al Gore and George W. Bush
neck-and-neck there. If Gore loses Minnesota, he loses the
election. ``Minnesota is no longer simply a kind of knee-jerk
liberal state,'' argues Stuart Rothenberg, the editor of a
Washington newsletter. ``It's just a bizarre state.'' &QL;

   MOSCOW _ Remember Russia this time last year, and pinch

Kremlin, under the ailing President Boris Yeltsin, seemed set for a
humiliating defeat in the forthcoming parliamentary and
presidential elections. The government was a corrupt shambles.
Since then, two big things have happened. The first is that the
Kremlin bounced back. It found a candidate for the presidency in
Putin. Second, power has shifted inside the Kremlin. &QL;

   EAST JERUSALEM _ Praising Ehud Barak for his courage at Camp
David _ while implicitly criticizing Yasser Arafat for showing less
_ U.S. President Bill Clinton has raised the controversial matter
of moving America's embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. He has
always wanted to do this, he said, but has held back because of the
damage it might do to the peace process. Now, ``in the light of
what has happened'' with the failed Camp David talks, he will be
reviewing the situation, and will come to a decision before the end

been too many failures but that there have been too few. &QL;

months have been rather depressing for America's funeral industry.
The top three U.S.-quoted companies, which control roughly a fifth
of the country's $30 billion market, have seen their share prices
collapse since the start of 1999. And a fourth is now in the final
throes of bankruptcy. Too much debt and too few deaths are largely
to blame. &QL;

   It could be every bit as dramatic as the revolution that hit the
world's telecommunications industry in the 1980s. And it is
occurring in an unexpected business; but one in which can be seen
the same forces of innovation, competition and choice that
transformed yesterday's sleepy telephone monopolies into today's
high-tech predators. That business is electricity generation.
Stifle your yawns _ power is every bit as big a business as
telecoms. Indeed, America's $220 billion electricity market is
larger than those for cellular and long-distance telephony
combined. &QL;

   Recent events have not been encouraging for Europe's crop of
once optimistic Internet start-ups. They include such spectacular
collapses as that of boo.com, a spendthrift electronic sports-goods
retailer that met impressive standards of corporate extravagance
while blithely losing a bundle. This week clickmango, an online
health-care business, became the latest of a string of such dot.com
casualties. Over the next few months hundreds of European
fledglings are likely to suffer the same fate as boo.com and
clickmango. Hundreds more will merge into larger entities with a
better chance of survival. The process of consolidation will have
profound effects, some beneficial but some harmful, on all European
companies, not just online ones. &QL;

Lebanese-Israeli border, a platoon of United Nations peacekeepers
at last arrives to start the job they were first given 22 years
ago. Twenty-five Ghanaian soldiers stake out a patch of soil
belonging to Lebanon, but repeatedly encroached upon by the Israeli
army. Having helped define the border, they must now prevent
incidents along it. &QL;

   MINNEAPOLIS _ The Democratic Party's campaign planners rarely
lose sleep over Minnesota. The state's voters have chosen Democrats
in all but three presidential elections since 1948, and in all the
six most recent ones. But this land of fishermen and Scandinavian
crypto-socialists is no longer a bastion of the Democratic
Farmer-Labor Party (as the Minnesota branch still insists on
calling itself). Recent polls put Al Gore and George W. Bush
neck-and-neck there. If Gore loses Minnesota, he loses the
election. ``Minnesota is no longer simply a kind of knee-jerk
liberal state,'' argues Stuart Rothenberg, the editor of a
Washington newsletter. ``It's just a bizarre state.'' &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ There was a spectre haunting the Republican National
Convention last week: that of the WASP (White Anglo-Saxon
Protestant) establishment. The entire point of the convention
seemed to be to prove that Republicans are just like the rest of
America: multicolored, serially disadvantaged and not a jot
WASPish. Was this all a charade? Had the real Republican convention
been held months ago in some exclusive club? Was compassionate
conservatism conceived in a fit of giggles over port and cigars? Or
is the WASP charge just another bogeyman dreamed up by the people
who brought you the Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy? &QL;

   MOSCOW _ Remember Russia this time last year, and pinch
yourself. Vladimir Putin was an inconspicuous bureaucrat. The
Kremlin, under the ailing President Boris Yeltsin, seemed set for a
humiliating defeat in the forthcoming parliamentary and
presidential elections. The government was a corrupt shambles.
Since then, two big things have happened. The first is that the
Kremlin bounced back. It found a candidate for the presidency in
Putin. Second, power has shifted inside the Kremlin. &QL;

   What do you do with a dot-com that is moving full-tilt toward an
IPO and the window closes? What do you do when you are spending a
ton of money to grow a business, confident that it will get a huge
valuation from the public market, only to find that it has no hope
of going public and the money is no longer there?
</P>
<P>
   Simple. If it is a start-up, you close it. You shutter the darn
thing and you take the loss. Layoffs. Ugliness. But contained to
the venture capitalists. No big deal.
</P>
<P>
   But what if it is part of an existing bricks-and-mortar
operation and was pumped up purely to capitalize on the public
markets?
</P>
<P>
   What if the whole growth effort started because you thought the
capital markets would lap it up and now you find that the public
markets have turned against you?
</P>
<P>
   What if the dot-com is burning a huge hole in your profitability
with no sign of a turn?
</P>
<P>
   That's where the newspaper chains of America find themselves.
They have produced these terrific dot-coms that have good reach and
lots of good demographics. They are Media Metrix winners. However,
they are huge money losers.
</P>
<P>
   The next battleground in the dot-com world will come from
bricks-and-mortar execs who are anxious to curtail or shut down
their own dot-coms but don't want to be too vocal about it for fear
that their own rapaciousness would become obvious. No one wants to
be known as the exec who decided to pimp the capital markets with a
dot-com because he saw the markets were easy pickings.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously these dot-coms don't make any money. They are heavily
subsidized by the bricks-and-mortar portions, none of which
particularly likes these dot-com divisions.
</P>
<P>
   There's a ton of private ``I told you sos'' going on in every
newsroom, believe me.
</P>
<P>
   But they can't shut the darn things. That would be an outrage.
Instead, they now have to put the screws to their own internal
dot-coms, telling them, ``Look, you missed your chance, now become
profitable and at the same time don't look to us for a lot of
money.''
</P>
<P>
   What a bind! Look for this story to go largely uncovered by the
newspapers. It is just too embarrassing for their printed words.

<P>
   DEERE IN THE HEADLIGHTS
</P>
<P>
   The dicey nature of cyclical investing surfaces every day. This
weekend, in my zeal to exploit the end of the Fed's rate hikes, I
earmarked Deere as a potential buy.
</P>
<P>
   Deere is the kind of classic cyclical that you buy when the Fed
is out of the way. Deere does well when the economy does well,
although, obviously it has a high farm component. Caterpillar acts
better because it is purer, but there is no doubt that Deere dances
to the direction of interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Ahh, but there is one problem: the near-term fundamentals. They
are not good. In fact, they are so bad that Bear Stearns downgraded
the stock Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Had I just invested on a ``macro'' thesis, that is, looked at a
stock as a proxy for the Fed's moves, I would have bought Deere on
Friday. I would have been down fast.
</P>
<P>
   When you are looking for plays off the Fed, you still have to
worry about the near-term. If the near-term is OK, you can buy. If
the near-term is suspect, you have to wait, even with the macro
getting rosy.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Deere downgrade has occurred, though, I am
wondering, after it reports, whether it wouldn't be a great way to
play the end of the hikes. I just don't want to jump the gun.

&HT;     STANFORD LOOKS TO FUTURE WITH ROSE-COLORED GLASSES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK FAINARU-WADA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ It's time for Stanford to start playing
football again, which can only mean one thing: Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, why not? The Cardinal did it last year against all odds,
despite having one of the nation's worst defenses (statistically
speaking, at least), and in spite of losing their season-opening
game by 52 points.
</P>
<P>
   So why not this year, when they will be trying to replace:
</P>
<P>
   _ An All-Pac-10 quarterback who is all over the school record
book.
</P>
<P>
   _ An all-Pac-10 receiver who is all over the league record book.
</P>
<P>
   _ A center who started 46 consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   _ An All-Pac-10, all-important left tackle who started 37 games
during his Stanford career.
</P>
<P>
   _ A strong safety who is No. 2 on the Cardinal's career
interceptions list and was a unifying force in last year's
bend-but-don't-break defense.
</P>
<P>
   _ A pair of starting linebackers, a starting cornerback and a
starting nose tackle who was seen as the squad's most improved
player.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are probably more things going into this year to be
concerned about, more questions marks,'' said head coach Tyrone
Willingham.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, it's not as if Willingham and the Cardinal didn't
have their share of unsettledness when they headed into last season
_ only to pull it all together and wind up taking the school to the
Rose Bowl for the first time in 28 years.
</P>
<P>
   With that backdrop in mind, and with the Cardinal set to begin
fall workouts this week _ freshmen report Tuesday, with the full
squad having at it beginning Saturday _ here are the most pivotal
issues Stanford faces leading up to its season opener, Sept. 2 at
Washington State:
</P>
<P>
   The new quarterback: The issue is not so much replacing Todd
Husak _ though that's no small feat given his success _ it's more
the question of Randy Fasani.
</P>
<P>
   Fasani was the most highly recruited prep quarterback in the
nation back when he was at Del Oro High School near Sacramento in
1996. But after redshirting his first season at Stanford, he spent
the next two buried at No. 3 on the depth chart behind Husak and
Joe Borchard.
</P>
<P>
   With Stanford wanting to take advantage of his athleticism and
Fasani simply wanting to get on the field, he wound up playing just
about everywhere but quarterback _ tight end, linebacker, special
teams.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Husak graduated to the National Football League and
Borchard having opted for a pro baseball career, Fasani will get
more than the token, goal-line snaps he has collected to this
point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy will be fine,'' Willingham said, ``because Randy is a
winner and Randy is a competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   The cohesion thing: Although last year's team began the fall
coming off a 3-8 season and with low outside expectations, it did
have experience and long-standing leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Now, things are a bit more uncertain. Fasani surely is a
leader-type, but he's new nonetheless. Plus, with Husak, Troy
Walters and Mike McLaughlin all gone from the offense, there's a
void in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Willie Howard and his Trench Dogs act are back on the
defensive line _ he's planning on unveiling a defense-wide nickname
at some point in the near future _ but five new defensive starters
mean some adjustments will have to take place.
</P>
<P>
   Said Howard: ``The big thing will be how we come together as a
team.''
</P>
<P>
   No time to waste: With the season opener also representing the
Pac-10 opener, the Cardinal won't have the kind of luxury they did
last season.
</P>
<P>
   As Willingham noted time and again after the team's 69-17
pasting at Texas to open 1999, the loss did nothing to derail the
Cardinal's goals. It was an approach that proved steadying and
prophetic.
</P>
<P>
   This year, though, Stanford begins with a 7:15 p.m. kickoff at
Washington State. Granted, the Cougars are expected to dwell in the
cellar again this season, but remember, the Cardinal were expected
to finish near the bottom of the pack last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the first thing you think of when you've got a
conference game to start the season is that there's no margin for
error,'' Willingham said. ``We have to come out quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Where are all the receivers? In addition to Walters _ ``I don't
know if you can replace a young man of that caliber,'' Willingham
said _ the Cardinal also must deal with the departures of Dave
Davis and Tafiti Uso.
</P>
<P>
   Davis flunked out of school and Uso cut short his career because
of a series of concussions, so the Cardinal lost their likely Nos.
2 and 3 receivers.
</P>
<P>
   They still have DeRonnie Pitts, whose talents were dwarfed
behind Walters to the point that Willingham said of Pitts,
``There's no question that he's the most underrated player in the
league.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, beyond Pitts, there's an untested group that
includes Ryan Wells, Caleb Bowman and Luke Powell.

&HT;     ARCHDIOCESE TO STOP EMPLOYING TEENS IN RECTORIES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JULIAN GUTHRIE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A decision by the Archdiocese of San Francisco
to no longer employ teen-agers as rectory workers not only takes
away opportunities from children but fails to address the problem
of abusive priests, child advocates said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church should look at dealing with the adults who have
problems rather than doing away with the kids,'' said Marybeth
Wallace, parent liaison with Coleman Advocates for Youth in San
Francisco. ``To take this opportunity away from kids is sad. What
will they do next, eliminate youth from participating in their
athletic league because there are adult coaches? Where does it
stop?''
</P>
<P>
   Archdiocesan spokesman Maurice Healy said the new policy,
ordered Friday by San Francisco Archbishop William J. Levada, is a
prudent move to avoid future child-abuse lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic Church's reputation has been tarnished in recent
years by reports of abuse and misconduct by priests. Across the
country, the church is estimated to have spent $1 billion in clergy
misconduct cases, and more cases continue to become public.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic churches have a tradition of paying teen-agers minimum
wage to do basic chores, such as filing papers and answering the
phone. The work is generally done in the rectory, the living
quarters for priests.
</P>
<P>
   The policy will be phased in at the archdiocese's 89 parishes in
San Francisco, San Mateo and Marin counties over the next few
months. Healy said the details of the policy have not been worked
out, but that it's not intended to be Draconian.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see any number of institutions taking prudent measures
like this,'' Healy said. ``This policy is not meant to reflect
poorly on priests nor punish teen-age workers. It may be overly
prudent but over time it will prove to be a good decision. Youth
will still have a number of interactions with priests, in schools,
youth ministries, other arenas. It just takes one avenue of
interaction out.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Unsworth, the author of six books on the priesthood and a
Chicago-based columnist for the National Catholic Reporter
newspaper, said he thinks the archdiocese's policy is misdirected
but not surprising.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one more byproduct of rampant paranoia of lawsuits,''
he said. ``I'm terribly concerned the church is turning to its
lawyers for advice rather than to its pastors. Here in Chicago,
when the cardinal calls a meeting of priests, he has a lawyer
sitting at his right side.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Catholic priests expressed sadness over the new policy,
but declined to comment on the record. They wanted the official
statement to come from the archdiocese.

   SCI-NILE-VIRUS (Undated) _ West Nile virus appears to be
settling in for the long haul. More slowly than expected, but
steadily, the mosquito-transmitted virus is dispersing from last
year's focal point in northern Queens in New York, leaving a trail
of dead birds that so far extends north to Boston, west to
Syracuse, and south to Maryland. According to virus experts, this
pattern indicates that West Nile, which was first identified in
Uganda in 1937 and flares up sporadically in Africa, Europe, and
the Middle East, appears ensconced in the New World. Many
scientists expect that a scattering of human infections and a few
deaths may well become the norm in years to come. Still, these
experts say, the disease appears unlikely to become a significant
threat to public health. By Andrew C. Revkin. (2100 words)

   SCI-PHYSICS-BIAS (Undated) _ Despite its image of arcane
intellectuality, particle physics is fast becoming a field with
plenty of heart-pounding, high-stakes suspense. The reasons lie not
so much in the field's recent string of discoveries as in how some
of them were made. Several large, multinational teams of particle
physicists, who design experiments to capture, measure and
understand the most elementary building blocks of matter, have
adopted an analysis technique that may best be compared to walking
a tightrope while blindfolded. The problem is bias, and it plagues
all realms of scientific experimentation. Recently, somewhat in the
spirit of biomedicine, research teams in particle physics have been
programming their computers to add unknown numbers, called
``offsets,'' to their data to make the outcome of their analyses
blind. When an experiment is over, the researchers open their
metaphorical sealed envelopes and discover what the value of the
offset is _ learning only then whether they are close to a routine
confirmation of theory, a Nobel Prize or a humiliating mistake. By

   SCI-CULTURE-THOUGHT (Undated) _ A series of studies comparing
European Americans to East Asias found people who grow up in
different cultures did not just think about different things, they
also think differently. Easterners appear to think more
holistically, paying greater attention to context and relationship,
relying more on experience-based knowledge than abstract logic, and
showing more tolerance for contradiction. Westerners are more
analytic in their thinking, tending to detach objects from their
context, to avoid contradictions, and to rely more heavily on
formal logic. By Erica Goode. (2000 words)

MOSQUITO SEASON IS PEAKING. HERE'S HOW TO BE READY
</HEADLINE>
 
 (EDS: Accompanied by WEST NILE-PREVENTION)  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By CAROLYN POIROT 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ If you think this summer's mosquito menace
has evaporated with the hot, dry weather, think again.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the favorite breeding time of the Southern house
mosquito,'' said Scott Sawlis, an entomologist and vector control
supervisor for Dallas County Health and Human Services. ``They like
dry weather and stagnant water high in organic matter. Another rain
would flush away all the breeding beds in storm drains and gutters,
where we can't see them.''
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, the Texas Department of Health is expanding
its mosquito monitoring system to look for the West Nile virus
currently making news in the Northeast United States, in case it is
introduced in the state this year. The health department is also
checking more than 200,000 mosquitoes to make sure they are not
carrying any of the viruses that can be transmitted to human
beings, including the viruses that cause St. Louis encephalitis,
dengue fever, Eastern or Western equine encephalitis or West Nile
encephalitis.
</P>
<P>
   All of the mosquito-borne viruses can cause brain inflammation,
with symptoms including a headache, sustained fever, nervous tics
or tremors, blurred vision, slurred speech and coma, according to
the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   West Nile encephalitis, closely related to both St. Louis
encephalitis and dengue fever, was first seen in the United States
last summer, when it killed seven New Yorkers and made at least 62
others seriously ill. By the end of last year, the virus had been
found in 17 species of birds in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut,
Pennsylvania and Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   This year, West Nile has been found in dead birds and mosquito
pools in New York and New Jersey, but no human cases have been
identified. The discovery of the virus has led to pesticide
spraying throughout New York City, including Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to combat West Nile, the National Institutes of
Health recently awarded a $3 million grant to a Massachusetts
biotechnology firm to try to create a vaccine for the virus.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to testing mosquitoes, the Texas health department
has added the West Nile virus to the battery of blood tests it
conducts on chickens and other birds, because the state is in the
migratory path of some of the birds known to carry that virus.
</P>
<P>
   The mosquito season begins in May and continues up to November,
with the most critical months July, August and September. That's
when Southern house mosquitoes, as well as the tiger mosquitoes
associated with dengue fever, are at the peak of their activity,
Sawlis said.
</P>
<P>
   A large outbreak of dengue fever occurred in Texas last year,
with 62 cases reported, including one death. Dengue fever is
characterized by severe joint pain, fever, headache, muscle aches
and rash.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I know, the state hasn't detected any mosquitoes
carrying virus yet this year, but we are still in the red (danger)
zone until at least the end of August,'' said Ray Parsons,
assistant director for mosquito control for the health department
in Harris County, which includes Houston.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 4,437 cases of the most common form of St. Louis
encephalitis reported nationally since 1964, according to the CDC.
The fatality rate for St. Louis encephalitis is 5 percent to 30
percent, the CDC says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most cases of St. Louis encephalitis are recorded in September
and October. We are monitoring carefully, hoping to catch it before
there is any human contact,'' said Glenna Teltow, section chief of
medical entomology at the Texas Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis encephalitis and dengue fever are the most common
serious diseases mosquitoes transmit to people in Texas, but there
have also been human cases of Western and Eastern equine
encephalitis.
</P>
<P>
   The deadliest of these viruses is Eastern equine. About
one-third of those who develop it die, and many others sustain
permanent brain damage. Fortunately, it is rare in humans. Since
1964, 153 human cases of Eastern equine encephalitis have been
reported in the United States, according to the CDC.
</P>
<P>
   Parsons said several cases of Eastern equine virus have been
found this summer in horses in Louisiana, and one human case was
reported in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far this year, we haven't isolated any viruses from
mosquitoes, although we did find some evidence of St. Louis
encephalitis in chicken blood _ one in Dallas, and one in Lubbock _
earlier this summer,'' Teltow says.
</P>
<P>
   Local health departments, mosquito control districts and some
universities are involved with the Texas Department of Health in
the surveillance efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Southern house and tiger mosquitoes, the ones that
come on the heels of heavy rains are ``flood-water mosquitoes,''
which are very large and aggressive, and a major nuisance, but are
seldom carriers of disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``They lay their eggs in areas prone to flooding ... and when it
rains, you get instant mosquitoes,'' Sawlis said.

A WHOLE NEW BALLGAME: KEANU REEVES LEADS `THE REPLACEMENTS' 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 (Includes a color slide of Keanu Reeves in a scene from ``The
Replacements.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Keanu Reeves stepped onto the set of ``The Replacements,'' took
one look at his trailer and demanded a new one.
 &HT;    Sounds like a typical case of rampaging Hollywood ego, but we're
talking Keanu Reeves, a quirky guy who's predictable only in his
unpredictability. Reeves' beef was that his trailer was too big _
he demanded a smaller one.
 &HT;    ``I generally don't need much,'' Reeves says. ``I don't need
much space. Just give me a room, give me some water, maybe some
food in the morning.
 &HT;    ``I remember hearing this story about a British actor who was
playing Lear,'' he recalls. ``He came to rehearsals and was acting
like, `I'm this great actor and you should afford me all of this
and you should treat me like this.' He was a prick. He was being
terrible to everyone.
 &HT;    ``The director said to the other actors, `Don't treat him like a
king in rehearsals.' And all of sudden he had no power. He wasn't a
king,'' Reeves says. ``So it is only something that someone else
can give you.''
 &HT;    These days Reeves has a fair amount of power. He can request
script changes or an extra take. And, yes, he can get a smaller
trailer if he wants one.
 &HT;    ``On this film, I was the leading actor in the piece,'' he says.
``Hopefully, if you keep him happy, you'll make a good picture. So
it's like an investment.''
 &HT;    And it sounds as if Reeves is easy to keep happy.
 &HT;    ``Oh, no,'' he says, laughing. ``You should have seen some of
the meetings between Howard Deutch and I, but ... ''
 &HT;    Deutch is the director of ``The Replacements,'' a shaggy-dog
comedy about a bunch of football has-beens and wannabes who are
called upon to fill in for a striking professional team. Reeves
stars as Shane Falco, a once-promising quarterback who choked in
the heat of a major college game and never recovered, now earning a
living scraping barnacles off boats.
 &HT;    The film, which will open nationwide on Aug. 11, represents
Reeves' first outing since ``The Matrix'' (1999) re-established him
as a star of major proportions. The actor insists that he felt no
pressure, from within or without, to sustain his career momentum by
scoring another hit.
 &HT;    ``I wanted to act,'' he says during a conversation at New York's
Essex House. Dressed down in a thin green sweater and black jacket,
with a scruffy beard hiding a ruddy complexion, Reeves looks more
like an average Joe than like a $20 million man.
 &HT;    ``I really liked the script and I liked the character,'' he
adds. ``I liked these misfit hard-luck guys who get a second chance
to try and conquer their fears and develop as people. And I like
comedies.''
 &HT;    Preparing for the role, Reeves dove into a get-fit regimen. He
altered his diet, lifted weights, worked out with former pro
quarterbacks and participated, along with his co-stars, in a
three-week training camp.
 &HT;    ``It was important to me to be believable as a quarterback, so I
did all I could to achieve that,'' he says. ``Part of that was to
have the body, to embody it.''
 &HT;    Reeves is known as a stickler for authenticity when it comes to
character details. He likes to wear the proper clothes, walk the
right walk, nail the accent and so on. While it makes sense that
he'd want to appear convincing tossing a football, some might
wonder if it was really necessary to make so intense a commitment
to a sports comedy.
 &HT;    The actor winces.
 &HT;    ``Everyone was an accomplished actor,'' he says, ``and I think
everyone came with the same feeling of wanting to have authentic
characters, to have them be well-rounded and have a humanity, and
to have the comedy come from that. You feel like you're not just
watching a device, but people _ it was important to everyone on the
film to achieve that.''
 &HT;    Next up for Reeves is ``The Gift,'' a drama that casts him as a
wife-beater and co-stars Cate Blanchett, Hilary Swank and Giovanni
Ribisi. He'll chase that with the just-wrapped romance ``Sweet
November,'' which reunites him with Charlize Theron, his co-star in
``The Devil's Advocate'' (1997). Reeves plays a detached ad
executive who falls for free-spirited Theron.
 &HT;    Come November, after touring with his band Dogstar to promote
their debut album ``Happy Endings'' and squeezing in the film
``Hardball,'' in which he's cast opposite Diane Lane as the
unwilling manager of an inner-city baseball team, Reeves will join
Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss and writers/directors Andy and
Larry Wachowski in Australia to make two back-to-back sequels to
the surprise sci-fi blockbuster ``The Matrix.''
 &HT;    Reeves and company will train for four months, and then shoot
Down Under for a full year.
 &HT;    ``I'm looking forward to it,'' says Reeves, who will reprise his
role as Neo, a hacker who's more than he seems. ``It's an
extraordinary circumstance. The films have extraordinary
opportunities and extraordinary ambitions.''
 &HT;    Like everyone else on the planet, Reeves was stunned by the
success of ``The Matrix.''
 &HT;    ``I had no expectation,'' he says. ``I really didn't know how it
was going to be received. When I saw it, I thought it was better
than the film I thought I'd made.
 &HT;    ``It had an ambition to create a cinema that hadn't really been
seen in that form,'' the actor says. ``It was recognizable in anime
or graphic art, in cartoon form. It also had the ambition to tell a
story in a different way, using kung fu or the science-fiction
metaphor.''
 &HT;    As an actor, Reeves is not everyone's cup of tea. Some
moviegoers think he should have stuck with the goofy likes of the
``Bill and Ted'' films and spared people ``Point Break'' (1991),
``Bram Stoker's Dracula'' (1992), ``A Walk in the Clouds'' (1995),
``Johnny Mnemonic'' (1995) and ``Chain Reaction'' (1997).
 &HT;    Others regard him as an underrated dramatic actor, pointing to
``River's Edge'' (1987), ``My Own Private Idaho'' (1991), ``Speed''
(1994), ``Devil's Advocate'' and ``The Matrix'' as evidence.
 &HT;    Reeves long ago stopped defending his acting abilities, however.
Directors want him in their films, and studios are willing to pay
millions for his services. More than anything else, then, he's
concerned about maintaining his privacy and integrity in an
immensely public, often morally bankrupt business.
 &HT;    ``I want to work in Hollywood,'' Reeves says, downplaying his
reluctant-star reputation. ``The experiences I've had have been
some of the best in my life. I want to act.
 &HT;    ``If a film is successful,'' he concludes, ``that has other
consequences. And I'm willing to go through that. Sometimes it's
fun.''

STONE COOL: STONE TEMPLE PILOTS COMES BACK WITH A VENGEANCE 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 (Includes a color slide of Stone Temple Pilots, including Eric
Kretz, Dean DeLeo, Robert DeLeo and Scott Weiland.) 
 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Most rock bands with sordid, troubled histories are easy fodder
for VH1's documentary series ``Behind the Music.'' But Stone Temple
Pilots' drama could also be titled ``Behind the Bars.''
 &HT;    When the group's most recent album, ``No. 4,'' debuted at No. 6
on the Billboard charts last fall, STP was moribund because
frontman Scott Weiland was in a California jail, sentenced to one
year in a prison-operated drug-rehabilitation program for violating
his probation from previous convictions.
 &HT;    With the band unable to promote it by touring, ``No. 4'' quickly
fell off the charts _ one more setback in a rancorous five years of
false starts and all-too-frequent stops.
 &HT;    But since Weiland emerged on Dec. 30, released nine months early
and as clean and sober as he's ever been, STP's fortunes have
revived. With a hit in the song ``Sour Girl,'' ``No. 4'' has
returned to the charts and is approaching platinum status, while
STP is back onstage, touring with the Red Hot Chili Peppers after
playing a series of high-profile shows such as the opening date of
the Tattoo the Earth festival, as well as performing to 90,000
people at the Hard Rockfest in Chicago.
 &HT;    ``We've been working really hard,'' says the 32-year-old
Weiland, who in May married model Mary Forsberg. ``A lot of people
said that they didn't think we could do it, and it's happening. So
we're really about the way things are going, and I think more than
ever we're very grateful for what we're able to do in our lives,
which is play music and write music and perform live and make money
doing it.''
 &HT;    Now Weiland and his mates _ guitarist Dean DeLeo, brother Robert
DeLeo on bass and drummer Eric Kretz _ hope to live up to the
promise demonstrated back when the southern California quartet's
debut album, ``Core'' (1992), hit the Billboard Top 5, sold more
than 7 million copies and launched the hits ``Plus,'' ``Sex Type
Thing'' and ``Creep.'' The album also scooped up a number of
trophies at the MTV Video Music Awards and American Music Awards
ceremonies, as well as a Grammy for Best Hard Rock Performance.
 &HT;    Its second album, ``Purple,'' bowed at No. 1 in 1994, but cracks
were beginning to show in the group's veneer owing to Weiland's
drug addiction and, he says, the other group members' own habits.
 &HT;    Weiland's first drug arrest came on May 15, 1995, in Pasadena,
Calif., and while STP finished a third album, ``Tiny Music: Songs
From the Vatican Gift Shop,'' a schism sent Weiland on the solo
trail and the other three off to form another band, Talk Show.
 &HT;    ``We never broke up,'' Weiland insists. ``We never talked about
breaking up. There was a period of time where that question
definitely loomed, but there was never a conscious decision to bury
the band. I think all of us felt the same way, and that was that we
needed time apart from each other to sort of trudge our own roads
for awhile. And we did that.''
 &HT;    Dean DeLeo says that spending nearly two years apart inspired a
new appreciation for each other and created stronger bonds, both
personally and musically.
 &HT;    ``Those other things we did fizzed out rather quickly,'' DeLeo
says, though he admits that if Talk Show had sold better there
might not have been an STP reunion.
 &HT;    Still, the guitarist says, all concerned found their separate
endeavors ``pretty unfulfilling. There was a mutual thing missing
between us all. It wasn't the same without Scott, and for Scott it
wasn't the same without us. It was hard, man, being out there
without him.''
 &HT;    Weiland agrees.
 &HT;    ``We experienced what we had to experience in order to get where
we are now,'' he says, ``in our personal lives and in our
professional lives.''
 &HT;    DeLeo says that ``there was a tremendous amount of anxiety''
when rehearsals for ``No. 4'' began in January 1998. But after the
first session yielded two songs _ ``Sour Girl'' and the first
single, ``Down'' _ STP was clearly back on track. Musically, at
least.
 &HT;    On the personal front, Weiland acknowledges, it was a different
story.
 &HT;    ``I hadn't come full circle yet in dealing with my heroin
addiction,'' he says. ``I was still sort of on the fence, kind of
stepping in and falling out of recovery. Unfortunately I still had
a few more chemical misadventures to experience.''
 &HT;    It took his incarceration last fall to spur the singer to clean
up, but he says it will be for good.
 &HT;    ``It's definitely not a pleasant experience,'' Weiland says. ``I
was fortunate to have done my time in a wing of the county jail
that was converted to an experimental drug-treatment program _ you
don't have to deal with the jailhouse politics and the racial
politics that you deal with in a mainline.
 &HT;    ``But it's definitely not an easy program,'' he adds. ``The
rules are a lot more strict than they are in the general
population. But I was able to get into the solution, instead of
wallowing in the problem.''
 &HT;    Weiland says he's staying clean with a routine of exercise and
support-group meetings, as well as his bandmates' acceptance that
those aspects of his life must take precedence over some of his
band duties.
 &HT;    Any guilt he may feel over his past behavior has been dealt with
by the amends he's made to family and friends, he says, as well as
by accepting that ``that was where I was at at that time, and no
guilt or worrying or dwelling on it can change the fact that that's
something that happened.''
 &HT;    He can't help believing, however, that his addiction was not the
only cause of STP's problems since the mid-1990s.
 &HT;    ``We've all grown up a lot as individuals,'' Weiland says. ``My
troubles have been documented in the press and are public
knowledge, but various members of the band have had their hangups,
too.
 &HT;    ``Now I think everyone, in growing as individuals, has got a
better appreciation of what we were all going through in our
differences with each other,'' he says. ``It's made us a lot
closer, and has taken away a lot of the resentment and jealousy
that used to exist.''
 &HT;    It's also making STP work a lot harder, too, he says. The group
has been working on new material, and expects to add several
original songs to a greatest-hits album, tentatively titled ``Big
Bang Babies,'' that's slated for October release.
 &HT;    And while the group knows how much is at stake in
re-establishing STP's reputation as a live band, Weiland _ who also
guests on Limp Bizkit's upcoming album _ says the shows so far have
been better than ever, especially since he's performing clean.
 &HT;    ``I love it,'' he says, ``because performing loaded is sort of a
disjoint thing. Opiates are anesthetics _ not only do they numb you
physically, but they sort of numb you emotionally and spiritually,
too, so it's hard to connect with the music and what's going on
onstage.
 &HT;    ``I have a much easier time now becoming intoxicated by the
energy that's happening from the audience and the energy that's
being created from the four members of the band,'' Weiland says.
``I'm able to enjoy it. I'm able to be present for it, where in the
past a lot of times I was hoping I could get through the two-hour
set so I could get back in the hotel room and fix.
 &HT;    ``I'm very happy that's behind us now.''

ALPHABET SUPER: SUE GRAFTON MAKES MYSTERY LEGIBLE

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of mystery writer Sue Grafton.) 
 By MEL NOVIT  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    After publishing 15 best-selling mysteries and creating one of
the most popular detectives in contemporary fiction, Sue Grafton
knows what she thinks of her own capabilities.
 &HT;    ``I am too stupid to do this,'' she says to herself about every
book she writes. ``I can't possibly figure this out. I have no
other images, stories, no other words, no other characters.''
 &HT;    Her millions of readers in 28 countries and 26 languages,
including Indonesian and Bulgarian, might disagree. Grafton's
alphabet series, featuring private detective Kinsey Millhone, began
18 years ago with ``A Is for Alibi'' (1982) and thus far has
reached ``O Is for Outlaw'' (Henry Holt, 1999), her 15th book and
one that President Clinton has been photographed toting around.
 &HT;    Her ``P Is for ... '' book, whose full title is still top
secret, is due from Penguin-Putnam early in 200l.
 &HT;    Speaking by telephone from her four-acre estate near Santa
Barbara, Calif. _ she also has a home in her native Louisville, Ky.
_ Grafton is brimming with confidence, having had what she
describes as ``an especially good day of writing.''
 &HT;    On days like this, she says, it seems as if she might make it
through the remaining 11 books in the series which the longtime
runner and power walker _ she does seven miles a day _ calls a
marathon: ``26 miles, 26 books.''
 &HT;    ``People used to be incredulous and were betting I couldn't do
it,'' says the 60-year-old mother of three and grandmother of two.
``Now they're rooting for me.''
 &HT;    They're also rooting for her alter ego, Kinsey Millhone, a
no-nonsense, kick-butt, now-35-year-old, twice-divorced, female
detective who thrives on a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet, booze
and perilous activities of all kinds. Millhone plies her trade in
l980s California, and Grafton ages her and her supporting cast
every few books.
 &HT;    Grafton takes particular pride in the fact that her fans are
about evenly divided between men and women.
 &HT;    ``Women have their husbands, sons and brothers reading my
books,'' she says. ``Men automatically think books written about
women by women are going to be about pantyhose and woman stuff, and
they're always startled when they like them.''
 &HT;    The Millhone stories are what Grafton calls ``closed
mysteries,'' mysteries with solutions. Rich in description and
detail, they are packed with well-researched, accurate information
on everything from water-reclamation plants and hotel management to
how a safe or a gun is constructed.
 &HT;    ``I do my own research,'' the author says. ``If you lay it off
on somebody else, you miss the good stuff.''
 &HT;    Not that it's easy. Grafton admits to being shy, adding that she
did use a researcher for ``A Is for Alibi,'' simply because she was
too shy to call the Los Angeles morgue.
 &HT;    ``I still find it intimidating to make calls to experts,'' the
author says, ``and I have to wait for a very brave day. When I was
researching `H Is for Homicide' (1991), I called the chief
investigator for the National Fraud Bureau in California. I got
halfway through introducing myself and he said, `I'm reading ``E is
for Evidence'' (1988).'
 &HT;    ``So I thought `Thank you, Lord. He knows what I'm doing _ I
don't have to explain.'''
 &HT;    Research only goes so far, however, and Grafton says that the
insights and revelations of her characters' dark sides spring from
her own imagination, including what she calls the ``sassy'' parts
that involve sexual elements and rough language.
 &HT;    ``I call these insights `my shadow,''' she says. ``The shadow
represents things about ourselves we tend to disavow. For the
average person, all of our criminal impulses _ our rage, our
pettiness, our meanness, our spite _ tend to be repressed. I
acknowledge all of these things in myself.''
 &HT;    She draws on her experience with a number of psychiatrists.
 &HT;    ``Some are good and some are bad,'' she says. ``The good ones
you learn from, like teachers. The one who helped me did so when I
thought my writing was flat and lifeless in `J Is for Judgment'
(1993).
 &HT;    ``My therapist, at that time, taught me Jungian theory _ that in
trying to look good for the world you repress the shadow and you
lose your creative energy.''
 &HT;    The shadow is only one of the various personas which Grafton
draws upon for her work.
 &HT;    ``I have many personalities,'' she says. ``That's how I
function. Many years ago I did the `Today' show, and my husband
videotaped the performance ... People asked me how it was, and I
didn't remember. Three weeks later I watched it, and there was this
perfectly poised woman with a very Southern accent just doing my
job for me. I named her `Georgia,' because of the accent.''
 &HT;    Grafton also acknowledges ``She Who Speaks,'' her persona for
public addresses _ ``she and Georgia are both showoffs and they
adore one another'' _ and ``The Warrior.''
 &HT;    ``When I trip into this one, my voice will drop an octave and I
think `You're dead meat,''' Grafton says cheerfully. ``She takes
care of business for me.''
 &HT;    Of course, there is ``She Who Writes,'' the persona who works
fanatically on her books and hates being criticized or tampered
with.
 &HT;    It was ``She Who Writes'' who turned Grafton against Hollywood
forever. Having begun her writing career as a screenwriter, she
soon soured on group-writing activities.
 &HT;    ``I hated Hollywood because I'm not a team player,'' Grafton
says. ``I didn't want to sit with five other people who were going
to help me with my work. I was treated kindly by them, if you want
to count being given soft drinks or coffee when you wanted them.
But where they trashed me was by taking their pencil to my work.''
 &HT;    As a result, Grafton long ago swore that none of her books will
ever be made into a movie.
 &HT;    ``I told my children I'd kill them if they ever sell me out _
I'll come back from the grave,'' the writer says, laughing. ``And
they know I can do it.''
 &HT;    Besides, Grafton says, she doesn't want a particular actress's
face to become that of Kinsey Millhone, because she doesn't want to
ruin her readers' fantasies.
 &HT;    ``No actress could ever satisfy all the conditions,'' she says,
while acknowledging that Kinsey is essentially a younger, thinner
version of herself. Grafton was once photographed for a book jacket
while perched on the bumper of Kinsey's famous Volkswagen, holding
a revolver.
 &HT;    Grafton is nearly finished with her ``P'' mystery, but says
there's no assurance that she'll make it to ``Z Is for Zero.''
 &HT;    ``If I got five more of them done and felt I was losing it or
cheating or getting bored,'' she says, ``I'd hang it up in a flat
minute.''
 &HT;    If she weren't a writer, she adds, she might enjoy being a
private investigator herself, or perhaps a skip-tracer, someone who
tracks down deadbeats.
 &HT;    ``I like sleuthing, finding out where people are and what
happened to them,'' Grafton says. ``I wouldn't mind working as a
criminologist or some kind of forensic expert. I tend to like jobs
with variety, where every day looks a little different.
 &HT;    ``I never dreamed I'd be able to make a living at writing.''

RHAPSODIC INSTINCT: JOE ESZTERHAS ON POWER, SEX AND `AMERICAN
RHAPSODY'

entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 (Includes a color slide of screenwriter/novelist Joe Eszterhas.) 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Joe Eszterhas has gotten rich by airing other people's dirty
linen, but insists that he has none of his own.
 &HT;    Literally.
 &HT;    ``The maids constantly ask my wife why I never have any dirty
underwear lying on the floor,'' he says. ``I don't wear any.''
 &HT;    In short, the highest-paid screenwriter in Hollywood history is
perfectly willing to dish the dirt on himself _ which is only fair,
given the controversy he's stirred with his gossipy new roman a
clef, ``American Rhapsody'' (Knopf, 2000).
 &HT;    The novel is about politics and pop culture _ and, as you'd
expect from the screenwriter of ``Basic Instinct'' (1992) and
``Showgirls'' (1995), there's considerable dirt to be dished,
including a detailed recounting of the Monica Lewinsky scandal ...
narrated by the president's genitals.
 &HT;    ``I think of this book as an upraised middle finger to
society,'' Eszterhas says, ``and my biggest worry was that it was
too outrageous, too in-your-face and too graphic. But I just found
that my book will be No. 5 on the New York Times best-seller list.
I guess I'm just stirring the drink again, and people are enjoying
it.''
 &HT;    On a balmy day at Chicago's Four Seasons hotel, Eszterhas looks
harmless enough. He's a non-threatening, exceedingly polite
teddy-bear type who says he'd never meant to write a political
novel.
 &HT;    But something snapped after he had back-to-back movie flops with
``Telling Lies in America'' (1997) and the even-more-disastrous
``An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn'' (1997).
 &HT;    ``One night I was scanning the channels and found myself on two
talk shows,'' he recalls. ``I thought, `You should be writing and
not talking so much.'
 &HT;    ``So I went to Maui with my wife,'' Eszterhas continues, ``and
we found out our phone was broken. It was sort of great to be out
of sync with the world _ it gave me a lot of time to reflect about
values.
 &HT;    ``Meanwhile, the whole Clinton-and-Monica-Lewinsky scandal blew
up,'' he says. ``I became a real couch potato _ I was consumed by
this thing. I started taking notes which turned into riffs. Riffs
turned into chapters.''
 &HT;    The novel's targets also include Hollywood, of course, and
Eszterhas freely names names, recounting anecdotes that may or may
not be true. Sharon Stone, Richard Gere and Michael Douglas are
among those who turn up in his pages.
 &HT;    ``The question has been posed: Will you ever eat lunch in this
town again?'' the screenwriter says, laughing. ``I intend to have
the best table at Spago for a long time.''
 &HT;    Despite the many juicy stories in the book _ Eszterhas recounts,
for example, a brief fling with Stone which the actress herself
refuses to confirm _ the writer insists that he's really kept the
juiciest stuff to himself.
 &HT;    ``In my mind, this is not a Hollywood tell-all,'' he says. ``If
I ever did a real Hollywood book, it would be thousands and
thousands of pages _ and then I'd have to move to Budapest. I don't
want to do that to my wife and the kids.''
 &HT;    The book's stories are all true, however, Eszterhas insists _ if
only because his publisher's lawyers demanded verification of every
item.
 &HT;    ``What they wanted was to physically see the backup,'' he
recalls, ``and I had 200 books on my living-room rug and untold
boxes of research materials and tape recordings that I put in their
hands.
 &HT;    ``At the end of this process, the lawyers said they had never
seen a book with this much backup.''
 &HT;    Eszterhas comes naturally by his flair for writing. Born during
World War II to a Hungarian novelist and a secretary, he spent his
first six years in an Austrian refugee camp. The family fled again
when the Russian army invaded Austria, ending up in Cleveland,
where Eszterhas' father got a job editing the newspaper of the
Catholic-Hungarian Society.
 &HT;    ``I didn't know English,'' the screenwriter recalls. ``I thought
my job was to learn as much about America as I could. Back then
music and baseball were my life. Elvis was my hero.''
 &HT;    That urge to learn about the society around him led naturally to
a career as a reporter. Eszterhas studied journalism at Ohio
University in Athens, then landed a job writing about music for the
Cleveland Plain Dealer, in the course of which he interviewed Jimi
Hendrix, Janis Joplin and other rock legends.
 &HT;    That in turn took him to Rolling Stone, where he covered
politics and celebrities for the magazine until a United Artists
executive asked if he would consider writing movies.
 &HT;    Eszterhas figured he might as well give it a shot, and cranked
out the script that later became the union saga ``F.I.S.T.''
(1978). He was off and running on a career which would include the
critically acclaimed ``Jagged Edge'' (1985) and ``The Music Box''
(1990), resounding flops such as ``Jade'' (1995) and ``Sliver''
(1993) and the box-office mother lodes ``Flashdance'' (1983), which
earned $200 million, and ``Basic Instinct,'' good for $352 million.
 &HT;    And, of course, the industry joke ``Showgirls.''
 &HT;    ``Women hated it,'' Eszterhas admits. ``A mistake was not making
an NC-17 film. We took seven seconds out of `Showgirls' to get an
R. Now I don't think that movie was strong enough.''
 &HT;    Eszterhas' personal life has been as vivid _ and as public _ as
most of his movies. Married since 1968 to fellow reporter Geri
Javor, he left her in 1992 during the making of ``Sliver.''
Meanwhile that film's producer, Bill MacDonald, ditched his wife to
become engaged to Stone, star of Eszterhas' hit ``Basic Instinct.''
Stone and MacDonald ended up breaking up, but Eszterhas married
MacDonald's ex-wife Naomi, and their marriage has lasted _ she's
expecting their fourth child together this August.
 &HT;    ``It's our fourth boy _ the others are 6, 4 and 2,'' Eszterhas
says, laughing. ``So all that macho stuff they accuse me of is
true.
 &HT;    ``I just love being a father,'' he adds more seriously. ``I was
blessed by God when I found Naomi. I call her my sunlight.
 &HT;    ``It did, of course, take me 50 years to get to this point.''
 &HT;    Joe Eszterhas, family man?
 &HT;    ``Yeah,'' he says cheerfully. ``I look like a Hell's Angel _ I
can't help that. The truth is I am a family man. I'm also shy and
self-conscious. Above all, I am a gentleman and a sensitive man.''
 &HT;    Well, perhaps in his own eyes. Others _ say, Bill Clinton, for
example _ might not agree.
 &HT;    ``I might have blown my meeting with the president,'' Eszterhas
concedes. ``A few weeks ago, I actually took the White House tour.
Several people asked the guide, `Who is that odd-looking person?'
The tour guide told them I was Russell Crowe from `Gladiator.'
 &HT;    ``Honestly, those tour guides looked very happy to get me out of
there,'' Eszterhas says. ``I asked to speak to the president, and I
was told, `He's out of the country.'
 &HT;    ``Do you think it was true?''

A WHOLE NEW BALLGAME: KEANU REEVES LEADS `THE REPLACEMENTS'

 (Includes a color slide of Keanu Reeves in a scene from ``The
Replacements.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Keanu Reeves stepped onto the set of ``The Replacements,'' took
one look at his trailer and demanded a new one.
 &HT;    Sounds like a typical case of rampaging Hollywood ego, but we're
talking Keanu Reeves, a quirky guy who's predictable only in his
unpredictability. Reeves' beef was that his trailer was too big _
he demanded a smaller one.
 &HT;    ``I generally don't need much,'' Reeves says. ``I don't need
much space. Just give me a room, give me some water, maybe some
food in the morning.
 &HT;    ``I remember hearing this story about a British actor who was
playing Lear,'' he recalls. ``He came to rehearsals and was acting
like, `I'm this great actor and you should afford me all of this
and you should treat me like this.' He was a prick. He was being
terrible to everyone.
 &HT;    ``The director said to the other actors, `Don't treat him like a
king in rehearsals.' And all of sudden he had no power. He wasn't a
king,'' Reeves says. ``So it is only something that someone else
can give you.''
 &HT;    These days Reeves has a fair amount of power. He can request
script changes or an extra take. And, yes, he can get a smaller
trailer if he wants one.
 &HT;    ``On this film, I was the leading actor in the piece,'' he says.
``Hopefully, if you keep him happy, you'll make a good picture. So
it's like an investment.''
 &HT;    And it sounds as if Reeves is easy to keep happy.
 &HT;    ``Oh, no,'' he says, laughing. ``You should have seen some of
the meetings between Howard Deutch and I, but ... ''
 &HT;    Deutch is the director of ``The Replacements,'' a shaggy-dog
comedy about a bunch of football has-beens and wannabes who are
called upon to fill in for a striking professional team. Reeves
stars as Shane Falco, a once-promising quarterback who choked in
the heat of a major college game and never recovered, now earning a
living scraping barnacles off boats.
 &HT;    The film, which will open nationwide on Aug. 11, represents
Reeves' first outing since ``The Matrix'' (1999) re-established him
as a star of major proportions. The actor insists that he felt no
pressure, from within or without, to sustain his career momentum by
scoring another hit.
 &HT;    ``I wanted to act,'' he says during a conversation at New York's
Essex House. Dressed down in a thin green sweater and black jacket,
with a scruffy beard hiding a ruddy complexion, Reeves looks more
like an average Joe than like a $20 million man.
 &HT;    ``I really liked the script and I liked the character,'' he
adds. ``I liked these misfit hard-luck guys who get a second chance
to try and conquer their fears and develop as people. And I like
comedies.''
 &HT;    Preparing for the role, Reeves dove into a get-fit regimen. He
altered his diet, lifted weights, worked out with former pro
quarterbacks and participated, along with his co-stars, in a
three-week training camp.
 &HT;    ``It was important to me to be believable as a quarterback, so I
did all I could to achieve that,'' he says. ``Part of that was to
have the body, to embody it.''
 &HT;    Reeves is known as a stickler for authenticity when it comes to
character details. He likes to wear the proper clothes, walk the
right walk, nail the accent and so on. While it makes sense that
he'd want to appear convincing tossing a football, some might
wonder if it was really necessary to make so intense a commitment
to a sports comedy.
 &HT;    The actor winces.
 &HT;    ``Everyone was an accomplished actor,'' he says, ``and I think
everyone came with the same feeling of wanting to have authentic
characters, to have them be well-rounded and have a humanity, and
to have the comedy come from that. You feel like you're not just
watching a device, but people _ it was important to everyone on the
film to achieve that.''
 &HT;    Next up for Reeves is ``The Gift,'' a drama that casts him as a
wife-beater and co-stars Cate Blanchett, Hilary Swank and Giovanni
Ribisi. He'll chase that with the just-wrapped romance ``Sweet
November,'' which reunites him with Charlize Theron, his co-star in
``The Devil's Advocate'' (1997). Reeves plays a detached ad
executive who falls for free-spirited Theron.
 &HT;    Come November, after touring with his band Dogstar to promote
their debut album ``Happy Endings'' and squeezing in the film
``Hardball,'' in which he's cast opposite Diane Lane as the
unwilling manager of an inner-city baseball team, Reeves will join
Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss and writers/directors Andy and
Larry Wachowski in Australia to make two back-to-back sequels to
the surprise sci-fi blockbuster ``The Matrix.''
 &HT;    Reeves and company will train for four months, and then shoot
Down Under for a full year.
 &HT;    ``I'm looking forward to it,'' says Reeves, who will reprise his
role as Neo, a hacker who's more than he seems. ``It's an
extraordinary circumstance. The films have extraordinary
opportunities and extraordinary ambitions.''
 &HT;    Like everyone else on the planet, Reeves was stunned by the
success of ``The Matrix.''
 &HT;    ``I had no expectation,'' he says. ``I really didn't know how it
was going to be received. When I saw it, I thought it was better
than the film I thought I'd made.
 &HT;    ``It had an ambition to create a cinema that hadn't really been
seen in that form,'' the actor says. ``It was recognizable in anime
or graphic art, in cartoon form. It also had the ambition to tell a
story in a different way, using kung fu or the science-fiction
metaphor.''
 &HT;    As an actor, Reeves is not everyone's cup of tea. Some
moviegoers think he should have stuck with the goofy likes of the
``Bill and Ted'' films and spared people ``Point Break'' (1991),
``Bram Stoker's Dracula'' (1992), ``A Walk in the Clouds'' (1995),
``Johnny Mnemonic'' (1995) and ``Chain Reaction'' (1997).
 &HT;    Others regard him as an underrated dramatic actor, pointing to
``River's Edge'' (1987), ``My Own Private Idaho'' (1991), ``Speed''
(1994), ``Devil's Advocate'' and ``The Matrix'' as evidence.
 &HT;    Reeves long ago stopped defending his acting abilities, however.
Directors want him in their films, and studios are willing to pay
millions for his services. More than anything else, then, he's
concerned about maintaining his privacy and integrity in an
immensely public, often morally bankrupt business.
 &HT;    ``I want to work in Hollywood,'' Reeves says, downplaying his
reluctant-star reputation. ``The experiences I've had have been
some of the best in my life. I want to act.
 &HT;    ``If a film is successful,'' he concludes, ``that has other
consequences. And I'm willing to go through that. Sometimes it's
fun.''

   Mosquitoes bite the hand that breeds them, say public health
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least one-quarter of our service requests are from people
who have standing water with mosquitoes breeding in their own
yards,'' said Scott Sawlis of the Dallas County Health Department.
``We find birdbaths and flowerpots or the dishes under flowerpots
and piles of old tires filled with water. Even treated city water,
once it has been sitting in the sun a day or so, will breed
mosquitoes. Used tires are basically mosquito condos.''
</P>
<P>
   To prevent mosquito infestation, the city of Fort Worth Public
Health Department suggests:
</P>
<P>
   _Empty or get rid of cans, buckets, bottles, old tires, empty
pots, plant saucers and other containers that hold water.
</P>
<P>
   _Clean clogged rain gutters on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   _Turn over plastic wading pools when not in use and do not allow
water to stagnate in birdbaths.
</P>
<P>
   _Use landscaping to eliminate low areas where puddles may
develop on your property, and water yards carefully so that no
water stands for several days.
</P>
<P>
   _For personal protection, public health officials recommend a
repellent containing the chemical DEET.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's best to stay inside with windows up and air conditioner
going,'' Sawlis said. ``When you are outside, cover up with light
colors and avoid the late evening when shadows help attract
mosquitoes. If you are outside, especially in the evening, spray or
rub on some repellent that contains DEET. It's been around since
the '40s and is still the best product out there.''
</P>
<P>
   For children, he recommended spraying the outside of clothing
and wiping repellent on ears and necks after you spray it on your
own hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also with kids, you may want to use a product with less than
10 percent DEET. I want maximum protection, so I use 24 to 26
percent on myself, but we recommend less for children.''

STONE COOL: STONE TEMPLE PILOTS COMES BACK WITH A VENGEANCE

  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 (Includes a color slide of Stone Temple Pilots, including Eric
Kretz, Dean DeLeo, Robert DeLeo and Scott Weiland.) 
 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Most rock bands with sordid, troubled histories are easy fodder
for VH1's documentary series ``Behind the Music.'' But Stone Temple
Pilots' drama could also be titled ``Behind the Bars.''
 &HT;    When the group's most recent album, ``No. 4,'' debuted at No. 6
on the Billboard charts last fall, STP was moribund because
frontman Scott Weiland was in a California jail, sentenced to one
year in a prison-operated drug-rehabilitation program for violating
his probation from previous convictions.
 &HT;    With the band unable to promote it by touring, ``No. 4'' quickly
fell off the charts _ one more setback in a rancorous five years of
false starts and all-too-frequent stops.
 &HT;    But since Weiland emerged on Dec. 30, released nine months early
and as clean and sober as he's ever been, STP's fortunes have
revived. With a hit in the song ``Sour Girl,'' ``No. 4'' has
returned to the charts and is approaching platinum status, while
STP is back onstage, touring with the Red Hot Chili Peppers after
playing a series of high-profile shows such as the opening date of
the Tattoo the Earth festival, as well as performing to 90,000
people at the Hard Rockfest in Chicago.
 &HT;    ``We've been working really hard,'' says the 32-year-old
Weiland, who in May married model Mary Forsberg. ``A lot of people
said that they didn't think we could do it, and it's happening. So
we're really about the way things are going, and I think more than
ever we're very grateful for what we're able to do in our lives,
which is play music and write music and perform live and make money
doing it.''
 &HT;    Now Weiland and his mates _ guitarist Dean DeLeo, brother Robert
DeLeo on bass and drummer Eric Kretz _ hope to live up to the
promise demonstrated back when the southern California quartet's
debut album, ``Core'' (1992), hit the Billboard Top 5, sold more
than 7 million copies and launched the hits ``Plus,'' ``Sex Type
Thing'' and ``Creep.'' The album also scooped up a number of
trophies at the MTV Video Music Awards and American Music Awards
ceremonies, as well as a Grammy for Best Hard Rock Performance.
 &HT;    Its second album, ``Purple,'' bowed at No. 1 in 1994, but cracks
were beginning to show in the group's veneer owing to Weiland's
drug addiction and, he says, the other group members' own habits.
 &HT;    Weiland's first drug arrest came on May 15, 1995, in Pasadena,
Calif., and while STP finished a third album, ``Tiny Music: Songs
From the Vatican Gift Shop,'' a schism sent Weiland on the solo
trail and the other three off to form another band, Talk Show.
 &HT;    ``We never broke up,'' Weiland insists. ``We never talked about
breaking up. There was a period of time where that question
definitely loomed, but there was never a conscious decision to bury
the band. I think all of us felt the same way, and that was that we
needed time apart from each other to sort of trudge our own roads
for awhile. And we did that.''
 &HT;    Dean DeLeo says that spending nearly two years apart inspired a
new appreciation for each other and created stronger bonds, both
personally and musically.
 &HT;    ``Those other things we did fizzed out rather quickly,'' DeLeo
says, though he admits that if Talk Show had sold better there
might not have been an STP reunion.
 &HT;    Still, the guitarist says, all concerned found their separate
endeavors ``pretty unfulfilling. There was a mutual thing missing
between us all. It wasn't the same without Scott, and for Scott it
wasn't the same without us. It was hard, man, being out there
without him.''
 &HT;    Weiland agrees.
 &HT;    ``We experienced what we had to experience in order to get where
we are now,'' he says, ``in our personal lives and in our
professional lives.''
 &HT;    DeLeo says that ``there was a tremendous amount of anxiety''
when rehearsals for ``No. 4'' began in January 1998. But after the
first session yielded two songs _ ``Sour Girl'' and the first
single, ``Down'' _ STP was clearly back on track. Musically, at
least.
 &HT;    On the personal front, Weiland acknowledges, it was a different
story.
 &HT;    ``I hadn't come full circle yet in dealing with my heroin
addiction,'' he says. ``I was still sort of on the fence, kind of
stepping in and falling out of recovery. Unfortunately I still had
a few more chemical misadventures to experience.''
 &HT;    It took his incarceration last fall to spur the singer to clean
up, but he says it will be for good.
 &HT;    ``It's definitely not a pleasant experience,'' Weiland says. ``I
was fortunate to have done my time in a wing of the county jail
that was converted to an experimental drug-treatment program _ you
don't have to deal with the jailhouse politics and the racial
politics that you deal with in a mainline.
 &HT;    ``But it's definitely not an easy program,'' he adds. ``The
rules are a lot more strict than they are in the general
population. But I was able to get into the solution, instead of
wallowing in the problem.''
 &HT;    Weiland says he's staying clean with a routine of exercise and
support-group meetings, as well as his bandmates' acceptance that
those aspects of his life must take precedence over some of his
band duties.
 &HT;    Any guilt he may feel over his past behavior has been dealt with
by the amends he's made to family and friends, he says, as well as
by accepting that ``that was where I was at at that time, and no
guilt or worrying or dwelling on it can change the fact that that's
something that happened.''
 &HT;    He can't help believing, however, that his addiction was not the
only cause of STP's problems since the mid-1990s.
 &HT;    ``We've all grown up a lot as individuals,'' Weiland says. ``My
troubles have been documented in the press and are public
knowledge, but various members of the band have had their hangups,
too.
 &HT;    ``Now I think everyone, in growing as individuals, has got a
better appreciation of what we were all going through in our
differences with each other,'' he says. ``It's made us a lot
closer, and has taken away a lot of the resentment and jealousy
that used to exist.''
 &HT;    It's also making STP work a lot harder, too, he says. The group
has been working on new material, and expects to add several
original songs to a greatest-hits album, tentatively titled ``Big
Bang Babies,'' that's slated for October release.
 &HT;    And while the group knows how much is at stake in
re-establishing STP's reputation as a live band, Weiland _ who also
guests on Limp Bizkit's upcoming album _ says the shows so far have
been better than ever, especially since he's performing clean.
 &HT;    ``I love it,'' he says, ``because performing loaded is sort of a
disjoint thing. Opiates are anesthetics _ not only do they numb you
physically, but they sort of numb you emotionally and spiritually,
too, so it's hard to connect with the music and what's going on
onstage.
 &HT;    ``I have a much easier time now becoming intoxicated by the
energy that's happening from the audience and the energy that's
being created from the four members of the band,'' Weiland says.
``I'm able to enjoy it. I'm able to be present for it, where in the
past a lot of times I was hoping I could get through the two-hour
set so I could get back in the hotel room and fix.
 &HT;    ``I'm very happy that's behind us now.''

 (Includes a color slide of mystery writer Sue Grafton.) 
 By MEL NOVIT  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    After publishing 15 best-selling mysteries and creating one of
the most popular detectives in contemporary fiction, Sue Grafton
knows what she thinks of her own capabilities.
 &HT;    ``I am too stupid to do this,'' she says to herself about every
book she writes. ``I can't possibly figure this out. I have no
other images, stories, no other words, no other characters.''
 &HT;    Her millions of readers in 28 countries and 26 languages,
including Indonesian and Bulgarian, might disagree. Grafton's
alphabet series, featuring private detective Kinsey Millhone, began
18 years ago with ``A Is for Alibi'' (1982) and thus far has
reached ``O Is for Outlaw'' (Henry Holt, 1999), her 15th book and
one that President Clinton has been photographed toting around.
 &HT;    Her ``P Is for ... '' book, whose full title is still top
secret, is due from Penguin-Putnam early in 200l.
 &HT;    Speaking by telephone from her four-acre estate near Santa
Barbara, Calif. _ she also has a home in her native Louisville, Ky.
_ Grafton is brimming with confidence, having had what she
describes as ``an especially good day of writing.''
 &HT;    On days like this, she says, it seems as if she might make it
through the remaining 11 books in the series which the longtime
runner and power walker _ she does seven miles a day _ calls a
marathon: ``26 miles, 26 books.''
 &HT;    ``People used to be incredulous and were betting I couldn't do
it,'' says the 60-year-old mother of three and grandmother of two.
``Now they're rooting for me.''
 &HT;    They're also rooting for her alter ego, Kinsey Millhone, a
no-nonsense, kick-butt, now-35-year-old, twice-divorced, female
detective who thrives on a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet, booze
and perilous activities of all kinds. Millhone plies her trade in
l980s California, and Grafton ages her and her supporting cast
every few books.
 &HT;    Grafton takes particular pride in the fact that her fans are
about evenly divided between men and women.
 &HT;    ``Women have their husbands, sons and brothers reading my
books,'' she says. ``Men automatically think books written about
women by women are going to be about pantyhose and woman stuff, and
they're always startled when they like them.''
 &HT;    The Millhone stories are what Grafton calls ``closed
mysteries,'' mysteries with solutions. Rich in description and
detail, they are packed with well-researched, accurate information
on everything from water-reclamation plants and hotel management to
how a safe or a gun is constructed.
 &HT;    ``I do my own research,'' the author says. ``If you lay it off
on somebody else, you miss the good stuff.''
 &HT;    Not that it's easy. Grafton admits to being shy, adding that she
did use a researcher for ``A Is for Alibi,'' simply because she was
too shy to call the Los Angeles morgue.
 &HT;    ``I still find it intimidating to make calls to experts,'' the
author says, ``and I have to wait for a very brave day. When I was
researching `H Is for Homicide' (1991), I called the chief
investigator for the National Fraud Bureau in California. I got
halfway through introducing myself and he said, `I'm reading ``E is
for Evidence'' (1988).'
 &HT;    ``So I thought `Thank you, Lord. He knows what I'm doing _ I
don't have to explain.'''
 &HT;    Research only goes so far, however, and Grafton says that the
insights and revelations of her characters' dark sides spring from
her own imagination, including what she calls the ``sassy'' parts
that involve sexual elements and rough language.
 &HT;    ``I call these insights `my shadow,''' she says. ``The shadow
represents things about ourselves we tend to disavow. For the
average person, all of our criminal impulses _ our rage, our
pettiness, our meanness, our spite _ tend to be repressed. I
acknowledge all of these things in myself.''
 &HT;    She draws on her experience with a number of psychiatrists.
 &HT;    ``Some are good and some are bad,'' she says. ``The good ones
you learn from, like teachers. The one who helped me did so when I
thought my writing was flat and lifeless in `J Is for Judgment'
(1993).
 &HT;    ``My therapist, at that time, taught me Jungian theory _ that in
trying to look good for the world you repress the shadow and you
lose your creative energy.''
 &HT;    The shadow is only one of the various personas which Grafton
draws upon for her work.
 &HT;    ``I have many personalities,'' she says. ``That's how I
function. Many years ago I did the `Today' show, and my husband
videotaped the performance ... People asked me how it was, and I
didn't remember. Three weeks later I watched it, and there was this
perfectly poised woman with a very Southern accent just doing my
job for me. I named her `Georgia,' because of the accent.''
 &HT;    Grafton also acknowledges ``She Who Speaks,'' her persona for
public addresses _ ``she and Georgia are both showoffs and they
adore one another'' _ and ``The Warrior.''
 &HT;    ``When I trip into this one, my voice will drop an octave and I
think `You're dead meat,''' Grafton says cheerfully. ``She takes
care of business for me.''
 &HT;    Of course, there is ``She Who Writes,'' the persona who works
fanatically on her books and hates being criticized or tampered
with.
 &HT;    It was ``She Who Writes'' who turned Grafton against Hollywood
forever. Having begun her writing career as a screenwriter, she
soon soured on group-writing activities.
 &HT;    ``I hated Hollywood because I'm not a team player,'' Grafton
says. ``I didn't want to sit with five other people who were going
to help me with my work. I was treated kindly by them, if you want
to count being given soft drinks or coffee when you wanted them.
But where they trashed me was by taking their pencil to my work.''
 &HT;    As a result, Grafton long ago swore that none of her books will
ever be made into a movie.
 &HT;    ``I told my children I'd kill them if they ever sell me out _
I'll come back from the grave,'' the writer says, laughing. ``And
they know I can do it.''
 &HT;    Besides, Grafton says, she doesn't want a particular actress's
face to become that of Kinsey Millhone, because she doesn't want to
ruin her readers' fantasies.
 &HT;    ``No actress could ever satisfy all the conditions,'' she says,
while acknowledging that Kinsey is essentially a younger, thinner
version of herself. Grafton was once photographed for a book jacket
while perched on the bumper of Kinsey's famous Volkswagen, holding
a revolver.
 &HT;    Grafton is nearly finished with her ``P'' mystery, but says
there's no assurance that she'll make it to ``Z Is for Zero.''
 &HT;    ``If I got five more of them done and felt I was losing it or
cheating or getting bored,'' she says, ``I'd hang it up in a flat
minute.''
 &HT;    If she weren't a writer, she adds, she might enjoy being a
private investigator herself, or perhaps a skip-tracer, someone who
tracks down deadbeats.
 &HT;    ``I like sleuthing, finding out where people are and what
happened to them,'' Grafton says. ``I wouldn't mind working as a
criminologist or some kind of forensic expert. I tend to like jobs
with variety, where every day looks a little different.
 &HT;    ``I never dreamed I'd be able to make a living at writing.''

 (Includes a color slide of screenwriter/novelist Joe Eszterhas.) 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Joe Eszterhas has gotten rich by airing other people's dirty
linen, but insists that he has none of his own.
 &HT;    Literally.
 &HT;    ``The maids constantly ask my wife why I never have any dirty
underwear lying on the floor,'' he says. ``I don't wear any.''
 &HT;    In short, the highest-paid screenwriter in Hollywood history is
perfectly willing to dish the dirt on himself _ which is only fair,
given the controversy he's stirred with his gossipy new roman a
clef, ``American Rhapsody'' (Knopf, 2000).
 &HT;    The novel is about politics and pop culture _ and, as you'd
expect from the screenwriter of ``Basic Instinct'' (1992) and
``Showgirls'' (1995), there's considerable dirt to be dished,
including a detailed recounting of the Monica Lewinsky scandal ...
narrated by the president's genitals.
 &HT;    ``I think of this book as an upraised middle finger to
society,'' Eszterhas says, ``and my biggest worry was that it was
too outrageous, too in-your-face and too graphic. But I just found
that my book will be No. 5 on the New York Times best-seller list.
I guess I'm just stirring the drink again, and people are enjoying
it.''
 &HT;    On a balmy day at Chicago's Four Seasons hotel, Eszterhas looks
harmless enough. He's a non-threatening, exceedingly polite
teddy-bear type who says he'd never meant to write a political
novel.
 &HT;    But something snapped after he had back-to-back movie flops with
``Telling Lies in America'' (1997) and the even-more-disastrous
``An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn'' (1997).
 &HT;    ``One night I was scanning the channels and found myself on two
talk shows,'' he recalls. ``I thought, `You should be writing and
not talking so much.'
 &HT;    ``So I went to Maui with my wife,'' Eszterhas continues, ``and
we found out our phone was broken. It was sort of great to be out
of sync with the world _ it gave me a lot of time to reflect about
values.
 &HT;    ``Meanwhile, the whole Clinton-and-Monica-Lewinsky scandal blew
up,'' he says. ``I became a real couch potato _ I was consumed by
this thing. I started taking notes which turned into riffs. Riffs
turned into chapters.''
 &HT;    The novel's targets also include Hollywood, of course, and
Eszterhas freely names names, recounting anecdotes that may or may
not be true. Sharon Stone, Richard Gere and Michael Douglas are
among those who turn up in his pages.
 &HT;    ``The question has been posed: Will you ever eat lunch in this
town again?'' the screenwriter says, laughing. ``I intend to have
the best table at Spago for a long time.''
 &HT;    Despite the many juicy stories in the book _ Eszterhas recounts,
for example, a brief fling with Stone which the actress herself
refuses to confirm _ the writer insists that he's really kept the
juiciest stuff to himself.
 &HT;    ``In my mind, this is not a Hollywood tell-all,'' he says. ``If
I ever did a real Hollywood book, it would be thousands and
thousands of pages _ and then I'd have to move to Budapest. I don't
want to do that to my wife and the kids.''
 &HT;    The book's stories are all true, however, Eszterhas insists _ if
only because his publisher's lawyers demanded verification of every
item.
 &HT;    ``What they wanted was to physically see the backup,'' he
recalls, ``and I had 200 books on my living-room rug and untold
boxes of research materials and tape recordings that I put in their
hands.
 &HT;    ``At the end of this process, the lawyers said they had never
seen a book with this much backup.''
 &HT;    Eszterhas comes naturally by his flair for writing. Born during
World War II to a Hungarian novelist and a secretary, he spent his
first six years in an Austrian refugee camp. The family fled again
when the Russian army invaded Austria, ending up in Cleveland,
where Eszterhas' father got a job editing the newspaper of the
Catholic-Hungarian Society.
 &HT;    ``I didn't know English,'' the screenwriter recalls. ``I thought
my job was to learn as much about America as I could. Back then
music and baseball were my life. Elvis was my hero.''
 &HT;    That urge to learn about the society around him led naturally to
a career as a reporter. Eszterhas studied journalism at Ohio
University in Athens, then landed a job writing about music for the
Cleveland Plain Dealer, in the course of which he interviewed Jimi
Hendrix, Janis Joplin and other rock legends.
 &HT;    That in turn took him to Rolling Stone, where he covered
politics and celebrities for the magazine until a United Artists
executive asked if he would consider writing movies.
 &HT;    Eszterhas figured he might as well give it a shot, and cranked
out the script that later became the union saga ``F.I.S.T.''
(1978). He was off and running on a career which would include the
critically acclaimed ``Jagged Edge'' (1985) and ``The Music Box''
(1990), resounding flops such as ``Jade'' (1995) and ``Sliver''
(1993) and the box-office mother lodes ``Flashdance'' (1983), which
earned $200 million, and ``Basic Instinct,'' good for $352 million.
 &HT;    And, of course, the industry joke ``Showgirls.''
 &HT;    ``Women hated it,'' Eszterhas admits. ``A mistake was not making
an NC-17 film. We took seven seconds out of `Showgirls' to get an
R. Now I don't think that movie was strong enough.''
 &HT;    Eszterhas' personal life has been as vivid _ and as public _ as
most of his movies. Married since 1968 to fellow reporter Geri
Javor, he left her in 1992 during the making of ``Sliver.''
Meanwhile that film's producer, Bill MacDonald, ditched his wife to
become engaged to Stone, star of Eszterhas' hit ``Basic Instinct.''
Stone and MacDonald ended up breaking up, but Eszterhas married
MacDonald's ex-wife Naomi, and their marriage has lasted _ she's
expecting their fourth child together this August.
 &HT;    ``It's our fourth boy _ the others are 6, 4 and 2,'' Eszterhas
says, laughing. ``So all that macho stuff they accuse me of is
true.
 &HT;    ``I just love being a father,'' he adds more seriously. ``I was
blessed by God when I found Naomi. I call her my sunlight.
 &HT;    ``It did, of course, take me 50 years to get to this point.''
 &HT;    Joe Eszterhas, family man?
 &HT;    ``Yeah,'' he says cheerfully. ``I look like a Hell's Angel _ I
can't help that. The truth is I am a family man. I'm also shy and
self-conscious. Above all, I am a gentleman and a sensitive man.''
 &HT;    Well, perhaps in his own eyes. Others _ say, Bill Clinton, for
example _ might not agree.
 &HT;    ``I might have blown my meeting with the president,'' Eszterhas
concedes. ``A few weeks ago, I actually took the White House tour.
Several people asked the guide, `Who is that odd-looking person?'
The tour guide told them I was Russell Crowe from `Gladiator.'
 &HT;    ``Honestly, those tour guides looked very happy to get me out of
there,'' Eszterhas says. ``I asked to speak to the president, and I
was told, `He's out of the country.'
 &HT;    ``Do you think it was true?''

 By MIKE ALLEN 
 c.2000 Hearst Communications Inc.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the second time this week that you've had to jumpstart your
car. Bad enough first thing in the morning, when you can use the
battery in your RV to give you a start _ but standing in a rainy
WalMart parking lot with your hood open and jumper cables in your
dripping hands is just plain humiliating, not to mention
uncomfortable and inconvenient.
</P>
<P>
   The standard solution: Install a new battery, which means
coughing up enough money to buy a new one and have it installed.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes of attention once or twice a year can perhaps
double the life of your battery, saving you cold, hard cash. And,
just as importantly, keep rain from running down your neck in
shopping mail parking lots on stormy nights.
</P>
<P>
   First, you need to determine if your battery is indeed fried or
not. Other reasons for a no-start or barely start condition
include, for openers, a marginal starter motor and high-resistance
wiring in the primary (starter motor) circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Open the hood. If your battery terminals are covered with green
fur that looks like it belongs in a bad sci-fi movie, you'll need
to clean that up. Start by pouring some warm water over the
terminals to dissolve the sulfation. This accretion is normal, but
it can prevent good contact between the battery posts and the
clamp, which in turn keeps your battery from providing enough
voltage to start or prevents it from charging properly.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the terminals, and brighten up all the metal with a wire
brush-style battery post terminal cleaner and a baking soda paste.
Don't splash liquid around the engine compartment or onto the
paint, and rinse everything off thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
   Dirt on the top and sides of the battery, even greasy dirt, can
hold enough moisture to create a current leak from the positive
terminal directly to the negative terminal, making your battery
self-discharge more rapidly. Leave the battery clean and dry.
</P>
<P>
   Now take a close look at the terminal clamps on the cables. If
they're eroded too badly to provide good mechanical contact,
replace them.
</P>
<P>
   Warning: Whenever you work on a car battery, always disconnect
the negative terminal first, not the positive. Why, you may ask?
</P>
<P>
   Simple: If you accidentally brush up against the fenderwell or
any other grounded metal part of the car while you're unhooking the
ground side, nothing will happen. But if the ground is still
connected, and you're wrenching on the positive side and happen to
touch any metal, you'll be holding onto a wrench that's suddenly
conducting several hundred amperes. That's as much current as an
arc welder, which means a large spark, lots of heat and enough
energy released to turn your wrench cherry red within a few
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid quickie aftermarket universal clamps that simply let you
saw off the old clamp and clamp on the new one. While these have
their uses (keep one in your car's toolbox as a get-home-tonight
expedient) they'll develop corrosion between the clamp and the
cable in a few months and leave you stranded, again.
</P>
<P>
   If you feel up to it and have a soldering iron (probably
propane-fired) capable of generating enough heat, you can solder a
new clamp onto the existing cable. Use rosin-core electrical
solder, not plumbing solder.
</P>
<P>
   Don't have the Great Mother of All Soldering Irons? The simple
way out is to replace the entire cable. If you're lucky, you can
pick up an appropriate cable at the auto parts counter.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, all they stock are simple one-lead cables, in
positive and ground. Yes, there is a significant difference between
the terminals on the battery, and you really ought to use a
black-insulated cable on the ground and a red-insulated cable on
the positive or the post will fit the clamp poorly, which is how
you got into this mess in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it's not always that simple. Some battery clamps,
both positive and negative, are soldered to more than a single
wire. You have a choice here. The best solution is to go to the
dealer and get the correct piece. That may be inconvenient, and
will certainly be expensive.
</P>
<P>
   You can solder lugs of the appropriate size and gauge to the
extra wires, and then attach the lugs to the clamp either by means
of the clamp bolt or a large sheetmetal screw into the clamp body.
Look for a clamp with an extra terminal if this is necessary,
although if you've got side-terminal batteries this might be
impossible. As a last resort, splice and solder the cables together
ahead of the terminal. Be sure to use shrink tubing to cover the
splice, especially if you're splicing the positive side.
</P>
<P>
   When you reinstall the clamps, cover all exposed metal with
petroleum jelly, white grease or my own personal favorite, Cop-Graf
or Nevr-Seez brand antiseize compound. This will delay the
inevitable growth of sulfur salts on the terminals by keeping
moisture from collecting on the bare metal.
</P>
<P>
   You've eliminated battery cables and clamps as the cause of your
no-start or barely start problem. And you figure it's not a problem
with the starter motor, because a jump start instantly brings the
engine whirring to life. So far, so good. Maybe it really is the
battery.
</P>
<P>
   Does the battery have a built-in hydrometer eye? This eye has a
small plastic ball suspended at the bottom of a clear plastic
window. The ball floats when the battery is charged, turning the
window green. When the battery is discharged, the ball sinks and
turns the window yellow. If the level of electrolyte is below the
hydrometer, then the battery is past its useful life.
</P>
<P>
   One danger of these built-in hydrometers: They check only one of
the six cells. If you've got a bad cell (the normal failure mode
for batteries), there's only one chance in six you'll know it from
the hydrometer.
</P>
<P>
   A better check is to use a handheld hydrometer. First you'll
need to remove the filler caps. Battery clean? Cover the battery
with a rag and pry the caps up. Warning! Battery acid will remove
paint, corrode electrical connections and potentially destroy your
eyesight. Wear eye protection.
</P>
<P>
   First hitch: no battery caps to remove, it's a sealed,
maintenance-free battery. Maybe so, but there's access to the
individual cells, perhaps disguised under a label.
</P>
<P>
   Open it up and look inside. The electrolyte should come up to
the bottom of the filler cap, or at least near it. If the level is
down, especially if the plates are exposed, add water. Always use
distilled water in a battery. There is never any need to add
additional electrolyte. Batteries will normally consume water, but
the sulfuric acid component of the electrolyte remains behind and
never needs to be replenished.
</P>
<P>
   Before you add any water, suck enough electrolyte out of one
cell into the hydrometer to float the bulb. Write down the reading.
Squirt the liquid back and repeat with the next cell. All six cells
should have readings that agree within 0.050, or you've got a bad
cell. These readings are temperature sensitive, so if it's very
cold or hot out you may need to correct the readings. The
hydrometer scale equates the specific gravity of the electrolyte
with the state of charge of the battery. If all the readings agree,
and the gravity is low, the battery needs to be charged.
</P>
<P>
   With the battery charged, open circuit voltage should be 12.6 to
12.8 volts with the engine off and all loads off. With the car
running and all loads off, the voltage should be between 13.6 and
14.5 volts.
</P>
<P>
   Disable the engine by pulling the fuel pump fuse. Measure the
battery voltage while cranking the engine. It should read at least
9.5 to 10 volts while cranking.
</P>
<P>
   If the charging voltage is low, suspect some charging system
problem. But if the charging voltage is correct and the cranking
voltage is low, then the battery is suspect, as you've already
troubleshot the wiring from the battery to the starter and ground.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing the battery is straightforward. It's vital that the
hold-down clamps be reinstalled properly. Some batteries use a
wedge/lip arrangement at the bottom of the battery, while others
(usually in older cars) use a pair of long bolts and a frame or lip
to hold the battery down to the tray. A battery is perfectly
capable of holing a radiator or smashing expensive fuel-injection
components if it doesn't stay put.

 (ART ADV: A photo of a visitor using a virtual-reality glove to

William Gonzalez at 212-499-3355.)
 By TOBEY GRUMET 
 c.2000 Hearst Communications Inc.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   About the last thing that comes to mind when you think about
Miami is technology. But, in addition to theme parks and white sand
beaches, there is a great technology museum just a 20-minute drive
from South Beach. It's the Miami Museum of Science. And while it
may not be as big as the American Museum of Natural History in New
York or as all-encompassing as the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C.,
the Miami Museum of Science has some great exhibits. And you can't
beat the location.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about the museum for me is its Sports Challenge.
It's an interactive exhibit that shows you how your body works as
it plays. The centerpiece is the virtual basketball game, in which
you play one-on-one hoops with a computer-generated opponent _
without a ball. Your court consists of a runway to move around on
and a 72-inch Mitsubishi projection television.
</P>
<P>
   Actually playing virtual basketball was more difficult than I'd
anticipated. Here's how it works: First, you slip on a colored
glove that corresponds to a button of the same color on the TV
screen. Next, you have to virtually press the button on the screen,
which to an observer can look like a lively game of blindman's
bluff. It's really very frustrating. Once you manage to coordinate
the button pushing, you're matched up with your opponent and ready
to play.
</P>
<P>
   You quickly become so immersed that you don't even notice that
there's no real ball to shoot and no other human player to block.
You do notice the workout. Coming off the court, I was glowing more
than just a little. I took off the glove and handed it to the
10-year-old waiting in line who was ready to play some serious
hoop.
</P>
<P>
   Two interactive exhibits are designed to teach you about
balance. The first consists of a small step that works like a
miniature seesaw. You put your feet on either side of the step and
hold onto a bar in front of you. When you think you're balanced,
you let go of the bar. A stopwatch times how long you can stay on
the step without falling to one side or the other. Trust me, this
is not as easy as it sounds or looks.
</P>
<P>
   Did you know that an average man's balance lasts 5 to 7 seconds
while an average woman's is just 3 to 5 seconds? I lasted for 6.3
seconds, as the years of ballet finally paid off.
</P>
<P>
   The center-of-gravity activity is much easier to master. Here
you have to crouch down, position your hands and knees near each
other on the floor and touch your nose to a dot on the floor. At
least you don't have to worry about falling over for no apparent
reason.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, at another exhibit, is a giant tublike container that is
a big attraction for kids. They are given small silver balls to
hold, similar to those in a pinball machine. Then, they roll the
balls down the spiral well and watch them pick up speed as they get
closer to the center of the tub. This display depicts the effect of
gravity on objects caught in Earth's orbit.
</P>
<P>
   By sheer chance, the day I visited the museum was setting up a
brand-new exhibit called ``Dinosaurs! Journey Through Time.'' At
the time, Disney was getting ready to release its new movie,
``Dinosaur,'' and everyone was going dino-nuts.
</P>
<P>
   This may arguably be the most technology-driven dinosaur exhibit
of its kind. Instead of massive, reconstructed dinosaur skeletons,
the museum's dinosaurs are three-dimensional models made of foam,
rubber and hydraulic mechanics (which use air pressure to work).
So, as well as being able to articulate and move, these dinosaurs
look more realistic than the bone-and-air variety you see at other
museums.
</P>
<P>
   The half-constructed apatosaurus was so lifelike _ even though
his head wasn't yet attached _ that I had to stop to feel his latex
skin and squeeze his body, which squished like a rubber ball.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Duran, the director of exhibits, even let me hold a replica
of a woolly mammoth tusk, which was so big I almost fell over.
</P>
<P>
   If you visit the completed dinosaur exhibit, you'll be given a
``passport'' that will be stamped as you walk through the different
periods of evolution, from the Permian Period to the present. The
tour through time wraps up in the Wildlife Center.

 (ART ADV: A photo of track star Ato Boldon springing out of the
starting blocks and one of the Adidas Performance Plate sole are
available on Newscom or by calling William Gonzalez at
212-499-3355.)
 By CLIFF GROMER 
 c.2000 Hearst Communications Inc.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Your heart is bursting but the tape and screaming crowds are
only yards away. Let it burst. Rolling across the finish line dead
_ but first _ is better than coming in second.
</P>
<P>
   Training, guts, mental attitude _ they all have a bearing on a
runner's performance. And let's not forget natural talent and
stamina. But there's another factor that can influence how fast a
runner's feet can pump over a track: what's on them. Running shoes
make a difference. Milliseconds make a difference, especially at
the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   To find out some of what's afoot at the upcoming 2000 Games in
Sydney, we spoke with Ciro Fusco, senior researcher for Adidas.
Fusco emphasized that there's no such thing as ``magic shoes.'' No
footwear can help an athlete perform better than his potential.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to minimize inefficiencies that detract from a
performance. Adidas sponsors Ato Boldon of Trinidad and Tobago, one
of the best sprinters in the world. The fact that Boldon could best
most runners while wearing wooden clogs is beside the point. Most
runners never make it to the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Running shoe theory is an evolving science with different
concepts falling in and out of favor at any time. One of Adidas'
competitors, for example, built its shoes on the principle of
energy return, or spring. Stepping down exerts energy into the
shoe, and that energy comes back to help the runner lift.
</P>
<P>
   Fusco doesn't buy that argument, saying energy return doesn't
work except maybe on a trampoline. The average running stride is on
the order of 12 milliseconds, so even if you have a shoe with
spring, he says, by the time the shoe can return the energy, your
foot is already in the air.
</P>
<P>
   The Adidas approach to footwear and other sports gear is one of
energy maintenance. In track and field footwear, Fusco says, think
of the foot as a lever that is pushing an athlete forward while
he's running. This means that when a foot flexes, energy is lost.
</P>
<P>
   Minimizing flex is one way to minimize energy dissipation. Fusco
came up with this energy maintenance concept when Adidas asked him
to conduct research into Olympic gear after the 1996 Games.
</P>
<P>
   When he started the project, Fusco studied how animals that run
evolved. Their heels didn't touch the ground anymore, Fusco found,
so their anatomy apparently had been modified. Such animals stand
on their toes and have very stiff metatarsal joints.
</P>
<P>
   The Adidas research team also worked with the University of
Calgary. A student, who is now a professor, was studying energy
dissipation and energy return at the joints.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the ankle, knee and hip joints in a person who was
jumping, for example, he found that energy is absorbed when there
is a contraction of the joint. Energy is returned when the joint
extends. During the milliseconds that this occurs, a small amount
of energy is lost due to internal dissipation.
</P>
<P>
   But when the student looked at the metatarsal joint, he noticed
something interesting. Energy was only being absorbed, or lost.
There was no energy return. He theorized that perhaps it was not
necessary to bend the foot during certain athletic movements such
as running.
</P>
<P>
   The student brought his findings to Fusco and talked about
stiffening the metatarsal joint to eliminate the dissipation of
energy at that joint. The idea seemed to fit Fusco's comparative
anatomy work and how to make a human foot run more like that of an
animal.
</P>
<P>
   The solution was a full-length, full-width shoe plate,
eventually called the Performance Plate by Adidas, which has the
right stiffness and flexibility so it does not impair movement.
With the plate, the joint isn't stiffened completely. The right
balance of flex and stiffness, needed to minimize energy
dissipation at the metatarsal joint, came only after tests with
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Running shoe spikes basically haven't changed in years, with the
exception of using a lighter-weight ceramic aluminum material.
Fusco and his team looked to see if their energy maintenance
philosophy also could be applied here to pick up a millisecond or
two.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic track surface is called Mondo, after the Italian
company that manufactures it. Rubberlike strips are applied to a
cement foundation, and the result is a uniform surface with good
traction. Sure enough, the friction of conventional metal spikes
puncturing the surface and being pulled out was a source of energy
dissipation. There was room for improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Mondo supplied Fusco and his team with specs on all of the
mechanical characteristics of the track. The data was used for
finite element analysis and extensive mathematical modeling to come
up with the answer.
</P>
<P>
   The team developed a Z-Spike, so called because of its Z-shaped
cross section. Unlike conventional spikes, the Z-Spike does not
penetrate the track for traction, it deforms it. The acid test,
though, was conducted with athletes.
</P>
<P>
   According to Fusco, the beauty of the Z-Spike is that only three
spikes installed on a shoe give the traction equivalent to a full
set (seven to eight) of conventional spikes. When athletes laced up
the shoes with the Z-Spikes without knowing what was on the
business end of the shoe, Fusco said, they later ``couldn't believe
they were running with only three spikes on the surface.''
</P>
<P>
   The benefits of the Adidas Olympic running shoe technology will
be filtering down to the general consumer. The Performance Plate,
while customized for each Adidas-shod Olympian, will be optimized
in stiffness and other characteristics for Joe Runner. Fusco and
his research team, in the meantime, are already pursuing the next
breakthrough in running shoe technology, whatever that may be.
</P>
<P>
   And, as for the effectiveness of the new Adidas running shoe
technology, or developments from its competitors, the Games at
Sydney will tell that story.

 By MICHAEL IGNATIEFF  
 c.2000 The New York Times Magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bernard Kouchner is smaller than expected, tanned like a '60s
rock star settling into lithe middle age. He's walking along a
dusty road between wheat fields in Kosovo with Lt. Gen. Juan
Ortuno, the Spanish commander of the NATO troops, and two Kosovar
politicians beside him, while a TV crew retreats slowly backward,
recording their advance. Although it has been about a year since
NATO called off its bombing campaign and the Serbian Army trooped
out of Kosovo, Finnish soldiers keep telling the camera crew to
stick to the path: the benign-looking fields may be mined.
</P>
<P>
   At the place where the dirt road crosses a railway track are the
fire-scorched remains of a rusty red van. Where the engine used to
be, there is a hole; where the driver's seat used to be is another
hole; and where the driver's door used to be is a twisted flange of
metal. Bernard Kouchner, special representative of the U.N.
secretary-general in Kosovo, runs the U.N. mission in Kosovo. His
job is to rebuild a land seared by war and hatred and to get
Kosovo's Albanian majority to live side by side with the remaining
Serb minority. The charred and twisted van is yet another proof
that this objective remains out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   Who was responsible? Brig. Richard Shirreff, a British commander
of multinational troops in central Kosovo, couldn't possibly
speculate. Kosovo is crawling with undercover intelligence agents
from a dozen countries, but they report to their agencies, not to
the local NATO commanders. The one certainty is that the dirt track
linked two Serb villages, and the only people using it were Serbs
and NATO patrols.
</P>
<P>
   The still photographers are now in position. The TV cameras are
rolling. Kouchner puts his arms firmly behind the backs of Ibrahim
Rugova and Hashim Thaci, two Kosovar Albanian politicians, and
nudges them forward so that they can all be photographed looking at
what is presented _ without a word being said _ as another Kosovar
Albanian attack on Serbs. This is the first time Thaci and Rugova,
inveterate enemies and rivals for power, have appeared together to
denounce what Kouchner calls ``a terrorist attack upon the peace
process.''
</P>
<P>
   It is widely believed that Thaci, also known as ``the snake''
when he was a guerrilla commander of the Kosovo Liberation Army,
may know more about who is behind this and other similar attacks
than he lets on. Most Serbs believe his ex-KLA men are in fact
responsible. Thaci knows what Kouchner expects of him, so he runs
through his lines with a solemn face, condemning, regretting,
affirming and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Rugova, looking ill and shrunken, stares glumly down at the
dirt, and when it is his turn, only mumbles: ``We need to work in
order not to have another tragic occasion. We need to change
opinions in Kosovo.'' The speeches are meager and perfunctory, but
Kouchner pronounces himself satisfied. ``The fascists must not
prevail,'' he says, in his Maurice Chevalier English.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the show is over, Kouchner works his way through the
small group of journalists, with an arm around the shoulder for
one, a quiet word for another. Thaci, too, briefly strokes the
local press before jumping into his car and racing off through the
howls of furious men lining the roads of the nearby Serbian
village. As Kouchner passes these crowds, behind the tinted windows
of his armored jeep, the Serb men look at him in angry silence.
``You've heard of virtual war,'' one member of his staff whispers,
wearily. ``Well, that was virtual peacemaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting Thaci and Rugova to the scene of the crime is supposed
to ``isolate'' the terrorists, to demonstrate that violence does
not represent the will of the Kosovar people. Yet there is a
willing or unwilling conspiracy of silence in support of these acts
among ordinary Kosovars, and the politicians' condemnations in
front of the cameras seem less convincing as a political message
than the dirty red van with its guts ripped apart.
</P>
<P>
   In the walled precinct of the Serb monastery at Gracanica, where
Kouchner's convoy appears next, he and Ortuno are not expected. The
only person there to greet them is the bishop's ``chief of
protocol,'' an apologetic Serbian woman in her 20s, who says that
the bishop is away but that his deputy, the Rev. Sava Janjic, is on
his way.
</P>
<P>
   Father Sava, as he is always called, a bespectacled monk with
the distracted air of a bright but harried graduate student, rushes
in, sweating from climbing the flight of stairs. He beckons
Kouchner and Ortuno to be seated. A spare chair is kept empty
between the two of them for Bishop Artemije, Father Sava's
superior.
</P>
<P>
   The two men are the leaders of the ``monastery moderates,'' the
U.N.'s wishful phrase for the Gracanica Serbs. Moderation in Kosovo
is a complicated thing. In the case of Father Sava, it simply means
that he has been willing to talk to Kouchner and even take part in
meetings with the Kosovar Albanian majority. But Father Sava
represents only a minority of Serbs. The majority live in the
enclave of Mitrovica, and their leadership won't have any part of
Kouchner's attempts to create dialogue between the two sides.
Kouchner tells the monk that he has come to express his condolences
at the latest attack. The Spanish general chimes in with a promise
in his broken English ``to increase the tempo of our operations.''
</P>
<P>
   None of this means much to Father Sava. Only a week before, NATO
patrols had failed to stop a grenade attack in a Gracanica market.
And the attacks on Serb churches continue despite NATO's efforts.
Kouchner tries to soothe the monk's nerves with promises of
continuing political support. ``We are trying to endure the
pressures,'' Father Sava replies, looking bleak and uneasy. The
pressures are not just from Kosovar hit squads with grenades; they
also come from Serbian hotheads outside the monastery walls who
don't think the father should be talking to Kouchner at all. ``I
can only say where it hurts,'' Father Sava says plaintively to
Kouchner. ``You will have to find the cure. You're the doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   He is a doctor, an M.D., and in this case, his patient is a
rugged, south-Balkan province the size of Connecticut that remains
on life support a year after the NATO intervention. Getting Kosovo
to stand on its own feet again _ in truth, building its entire
political and economic infrastructure from nothing _ is the most
ambitious project the United Nations has ever undertaken. Kouchner
and a staff of several thousand have restarted the schools, found
shelter for hundreds of thousands of returning refugees and
established an official currency _ the German mark. Their signal
failure, so far, has been to get Kosovars to live with the
remaining Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Kouchner is not just another international politician making a
second career in the Balkans. He sees Kosovo as the culmination of
everything he has ever worked for. Thirty years ago, as a young
doctor working for the International Red Cross in Biafra, he
rebelled against the doctrine of silent neutrality. He ripped off
his Red Cross armband and helped found Doctors Without Borders, the
organization whose noisy denunciation of rights-violating regimes
marked a revolutionary departure from the silent discretion of the
Red Cross. Though he separated angrily from Doctors more than 20
years ago, when the group won the Nobel Peace Prize last year, his
French critics _ and they are legion _ observed sardonically that
he behaved as if he had won the prize himself.
</P>
<P>
   For the past three decades, as a militant doctor, Kouchner has
been campaigning for le droit d'intervention humanitaire, the right
to intervene when states oppress their own citizens. He is
criticized for talking as if he invented the doctrine of
humanitarian intervention all on his own. But certainly as
Mitterrand's minister for humanitarian action in the 1980s, he did
a spectacular job of publicizing the idea with dramatically staged
media operations.
</P>
<P>
   He claims with a certain disingenuousness that he seeks
publicity not for himself but for victims: ``Without photography,
massacres would not exist. Nothing can be done without pressure on
politicians.'' It is Kouchner, more than anyone else, who taught
nongovernmental aid agencies to use the political and fund-raising
power of the media. Where Kouchner led with Doctors Without
Borders, all modern humanitarian agencies now follow. When the
French insisted on his candidacy for the Kosovo job last year, many
veterans of the Balkans rolled their eyes in disbelief. But even
his harshest critics in Kosovo concede that he has stamina.
</P>
<P>
   Those in Pristina who predicted he would be on the plane home to
Paris every weekend have been proved wrong. ``He lives the job 24
hours a day,'' says Gen. Klaus Reinhardt, the German who until
recently served as the commander of the NATO-led Kosovo force,
known as KFOR. ``That's his strength, and also his weakness.'' Why
weakness? Because he takes everything personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I do,'' Kouchner retorts. ``I've been a human rights
activist for 30 years, and here I am unable to stop people being
massacred.'' Which is why when U.N. headquarters in New York is
calling Kosovo a success _ compared with the U.N. mission in Sierra
Leone, Kosovo is bound to look like a success _ Kouchner refuses to
use the word. ``Politically maybe, we are a success, but in human
rights terms, no.''
</P>
<P>
   In his office in Pristina, he shows reporters a graph of
inter-ethnic killings: from a high of about 50 a week last year,
they have declined to one or two a week. There are more murders in
Washington than in Kosovo, Kouchner insists, but he must know that
this is beside the point. The Kosovo killings are political, and
they are a direct challenge to the 19-nation coalition that
intervened in Kosovo to stop ethnic cleansing and finds itself
unable to prevent cleansing in reverse.
</P>
<P>
   Wait a minute, Kouchner says. The systematic use of Serbian
state terror to kill thousands of people and expel nearly a million
others from their homes cannot be compared to individual acts of
terror.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the ferocity of the hatred in Kosovo took Kouchner by
surprise. He arrived in July 1999 talking about European values,
tolerance and multiculturalism. By Christmas, though, as the tide
of killings kept rising, he had scaled back his rhetoric of
reconciliation. The word he uses now is coexistence.
</P>
<P>
   Coexistence has nothing to do with any Western ideal of
multicultural tolerance. Coexistence means going back to the way
Kosovo was between 1974, when Tito gave the Kosovars autonomy, and
1989, when Serbia's Milosevic abolished it. In those relatively
good old days, at least if memory is not lying, there were Serbs on
one side of the main street in Pristina and Kosovar Albanians on
the other. One street, two languages, two ways of life. Now there
is just one language and one way of life in the cafes, and ordering
a beer in Serbian is a distinctly bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of hatred gives Kouchner a huge political problem:
donors won't pony up the money for rebuilding and countries won't
send contingents of soldiers and police because they don't want to
be seen aiding and abetting a nasty new ethnic majority tyranny in
Kosovo. But children's graves in places like Celine explain why
Western sermons about tolerance are met with stony silence among
the Kosovar population. There may be as many as 500 other Celines,
mass grave sites where forensic teams from the International
Criminal Tribunal at The Hague are still pulling bodies from the
ground. Despite revisionist claims to the contrary, original NATO
estimates that more than 10,000 Kosovar Albanians were killed in
Kosovo by Serb police and paramilitaries between March and May 1999
will be proved right. In addition, there are more than 1,500
detainees in Serb prisons, as well as thousands still missing. This
ensures that the past in Kosovo remains a wound that will not heal.
</P>
<P>
   In the courts that Kouchner has managed to set up, mixed panels
of Kosovars, international judges and Serbs are trying the few
perpetrators who did not flee to Serbia. The defendants are charged
not with murder but with genocide. And while foreign observers,
notably Israeli reporters, have been incredulous that there can be
a genocide trial with only one named victim and one perpetrator,
Kosovars remain convinced that they were all potential victims of a
crime against humanity that failed only because both NATO and the
KLA came to their defense.
</P>
<P>
   This new identity as intended victims of genocide helps to
explain, if it does not justify, the lack of affect with which
people tell you, for example, that there had been Serbs in their
apartment blocks in Pristina but they were all in Serbia now _
except, of course, the old lady who had been thrown into her
bathtub in her clothes and drowned by a young Albanian couple
looking to take over her two rooms.
</P>
<P>
   But Kouchner's problem is not just overcoming the cold fury of
the Kosovars. There is also the huge obstacle of Serb denial, the
refusal to admit either the crimes done in their name or their
historical defeat. In Mitrovica, a Kosovo city divided by the Ibar
River, the Kosovar Albanians live in the south while the Serbs live
in the north. These Mitrovica Serbs along with those living in
other towns north of the river total 55,000. They are effectively
living in Serbia, drawing pensions and salaries from Belgrade,
using the dinar rather than the mark and effectively frustrating
any attempt by the United Nations to return Kosovars to the region.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb leader there, Oliver Ivanovic, is an ingratiatingly
fluent English speaker, a former factory manager in his 50s who
taught karate on the side. When NATO rolled into Mitrovica last
summer, Ivanovic organized his karate class into the ``bridge
watchers,'' the men in dark glasses with walkie-talkies and
concealed weapons who guarded the north side of the river and made
it impossible for the small number of Kosovar Albanians to return
to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanovic denies that he is Milosevic's man in Mitrovica. Indeed,
he claims to be his own man and insists that Milosevic made a
mistake in taking on ``the international community'' over Kosovo.
His job, Ivanovic says, is to get the Serbs to cooperate with the
internationals. So he will tell you that he can do business with
the American general who runs the U.N. operation in Mitrovica and
how he is willing to work with the Kosovar Albanian mayor on the
south side of the river. But when he strays from his script and
talks about the local zinc and tin mines, the cooperative language
fades.
</P>
<P>
   Look what has happened to the mines since we retreated in 1999,
he says, waving his arms. The Albanians have ruined them. They're
all flooded. And look at the electricity generators. Now that the
Serb managers have left, the power keeps shutting down. Two decades
of Serb underinvestment and neglect are bypassed in an argument
that ends, inevitably, with the suggestion that everything would be
fine if the old Serb managers were put back in charge.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Ivanovic says, Kouchner is really here to prepare
Kosovo for independence. He's not here to protect us. He's here to
give the Albanians what they want. When this is reported to
Kouchner, he shrugs again with fatalistic patience and fingers his
worry beads. ``I never talk about independence,'' he says. ``It has
nothing to do with me. My mandate is purely and simply to prepare
Kosovo for substantial autonomy.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that 1244, the U.N. resolution he has been sent
here to enforce, is political science fiction. It reaffirms the
sovereignty of Yugoslavia over Kosovo, and it also calls for the
Kosovars to enjoy ``substantial autonomy and self-government.''
Which sounds fine, except that no Kosovar will ever accept
Belgrade's sovereignty in Kosovo and no Serb in Kosovo wants to
accept Kosovar majority rule.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a minority that still believes it is in Serbia and a
majority that wants a state, Kouchner and his team have gradually
given up talk of tolerance. They have focused instead on hard
politics _ assembling a Kosovo Transitional Council to force the
local leaders to sit down together, enrolling voters for municipal
elections in the autumn and helping to draft a blueprint for
self-governance. Changing hearts and minds will come later.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Kouchner's job is to force Serbs and Kosovars to
cooperate, to make them practice Western values, if not at
gunpoint, then under the implicit threat that if they don't, the
internationals will go and leave them to their Balkan hatreds. But
the threat is a weak one, because most Kosovars understand that the
Western troops cannot withdraw as long as Milosevic is in power in
Belgrade. So the locals have the internationals over a barrel. As a
result, the progress of coexistence is agonizingly slow. Kosovars
and Serbs sit in Kouchner's large office, a former government
headquarters, and they fight over every comma and semicolon. At the
end of the meetings, Kouchner's shoulders hurt from the strain of
simply keeping victim and victimizer from stalking out. But this is
the core of his job: to create political trust where none exists,
to create democracy where none has ever taken root before.
</P>
<P>
   If you ask Kouchner what he has learned from Kosovo, he says it
is something he knew all along: that humanitarianism is political.
It means abandoning specious kinds of neutrality, taking the side
of the victim and making enough noise to rouse the powerful and
indifferent from their slumbers. But as practiced by Bernard
Kouchner, humanitarianism owes more to Machiavelli than to Mother
Teresa. Not that he would want it any other way. Having called for
intervention all his life, suddenly at 60 years of age he's staking
his reputation on the proposition that he can actually make one
work.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly every day inside Green Haven Prison in Stormville, N.Y.,
behind the 30-foot-high concrete walls and 12 watchtowers, within
the endless gray corridors and tiers of windowless cells, the
inmate Robert Sanders asked the same question: Why am I here? He
asked the guards in the main unit of the maximum-security prison,
where he spent most of his time alone in Cell No. 22 on the third
level, crying and praying and drinking too much coffee. He asked
the doctors, social workers and nurses in the psychiatric unit,
where he was often sent to deal with the voices in his head.
</P>
<P>
   To the staff members, his questions were evidence of his
psychosis. ``He becomes delusional,'' they wrote in his chart. ``He
has bizarre behavior.'' The prisoner had a habit of picking
cigarette butts up off the floor, but not of showering. Everyone
complained that he gave off an unbearable smell, and the red-hooded
sweatshirt he habitually wore was caked with food and dirt. They
complained at night, too, when his chattering echoed down the
narrow hall of A Block. The psychiatric team urged him to improve
his hygiene and attend classes in ``daily living skills.'' He was
given 15 minutes of weekly therapy and heavy doses of Haldol, an
antipsychotic drug that left his body rigid and his emotions flat.
But his bewilderment grew. ``Pt. said he has no idea why the plane
took him to N.Y.,'' a nurse wrote in Sanders' chart. He also ``does
not know what crime he did and his name is not Robert.''
</P>
<P>
   Prison records showed that Robert Sanders was a career criminal
from New York who tried to kill a man over cocaine in 1990 and
escaped three years later while on work release at a
minimum-security prison in the Bronx. Within months, he was
recaptured and sent to Green Haven, a virtual fortress that houses
the state's only execution chamber and 2,194 of its most violent
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   There, the inmate told the staff about his life in Los Angeles.
He talked about his mother, Mary, who had given birth to eight
children before she had her youngest child, a boy named Kerry. He
knew a lot about carpentry. And he remembered spending time at a
mental hospital in Los Angeles because he was sick. But he could
not understand why he was in prison or why everyone was calling him
Robert.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks somewhat confused,'' wrote Dr. Edward Y. Chung, the
psychiatrist who oversaw the inmate's care, ``and the response to
the questioning is illogical.'' Harold Roberson, a therapist in the
psychiatric unit, recorded similar observations. ``He has on
several occasions made statements that would indicate delusional
thinking,'' Roberson wrote in the chart. ``He stated we are holding
him here because he committed no crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   The inmate's assertion might well have seemed implausible, given
the extensive system of checks and safeguards used in law
enforcement to ensure that one person is not mistaken for another.
There is a national database of fingerprints and photographs, which
are taken when people are arrested; there are lawyers and judges to
protect and administer justice; and there are prison staffs with
files on the medical, personal and criminal histories of inmates.
The United States has had its share of wrongly convicted people,
but the idea that a man who had never even been convicted was
behind bars seemed inconceivable. That a prison did not know whom
it had in custody would mean it had failed the most basic test of
its competence and security.
</P>
<P>
   So Sanders was shuttled from his cell to the psychiatric unit
and back to his cell again. The staff continued to give him Haldol.
He continued to sink deeper into depression and invisibility.
Weeks, months and finally two years passed as Mary Sanders Lee
searched for her youngest son in the streets of Los Angeles. But
she would never find him there. Kerry Sanders was in Green Haven
prison in Stormville, N.Y., serving time for a man named Robert.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Sanders had a sweet disposition, but he was not someone
who had much luck in life. Being born on the particular day of June
25, 1966, would turn out to be his greatest misfortune. He had
grown up in the neighborhoods of South-Central Los Angeles, and by
the time he was 27, he had been in and out of mental hospitals for
seven years, his body and spirit losing out to the voices in his
head. He was found to be suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, and
like many people with the disease, he felt the relief and
desperation that came with going on and off his medication.
</P>
<P>
   When Sanders was not in the hospital, he stayed with his mother
or one of his sisters. When his demons became too great, he would
leave for the streets. On the morning of Oct. 5, 1993, he was
sleeping on a bench outside the Los Angeles County-University of
Southern California Medical Center when Richard S. Bentley, a
county police officer patrolling the hospital grounds, approached
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's up?'' asked Sanders, who was wearing a black T-shirt
and jeans and had just opened his eyes. Officer Bentley's police
report shows that he asked Sanders if he was all right or needed
medical assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I'm all right,'' Sanders replied. ``I was just
sleeping.'' There was a bandage on his leg, and he said he had been
treated at the hospital earlier that night. He told the officer he
was homeless and showed him hospital identification, which gave his
name, Kerry Sanders, and date of birth. The officer asked whether
he had ``any business'' at the hospital. ``No, sir,'' Sanders
answered.
</P>
<P>
   Bentley then cited Sanders for trespassing and radioed the
information to a police dispatcher. Up came two warrants under the
name Sanders with the birth date of June 25, 1966. One was for
Kerry Sanders, for failing to appear at a hearing over a jaywalking
ticket in Los Angeles. The other was for Robert Sanders, an escaped
felon from New York; it advised ``caution.'' The warrants listed
each man as African-American. Robert Sanders was described as 5
foot 8, 175 pounds and a native of New York City. He had scars on
both arms. Kerry Sanders was described as 5 foot 6 and 155 pounds.
He had one scar on his left arm.
</P>
<P>
   Bentley said in a recent interview that when he asked Sanders if
he used any other names, he responded, ``Yes _ Terry and Robert.''
``I asked him whether he was the Robert Sanders they were looking
for in New York,'' Bentley said, ``and he looked me straight in the
eye and said, 'Yes, I am.''' But in his police report, Bentley
listed only ``Terry'' under nicknames and made no mention of the
exchange about New York. Bentley told his superiors that he
suspected Kerry Sanders was the fugitive Robert Sanders. The case
was turned over to the Los Angeles Police Department, and at 11:56
a.m. Kerry Sanders was arrested and booked as Robert Sanders. The
booking sheet included Kerry's physical characteristics _ his
height and weight, his right thumb print, the scar on his left arm
_ and Robert's birthplace and fugitive warrant number. Within 24
hours, Kerry Sanders' extradition was approved. Within two weeks,
he was in the New York State correctional system, answering to the
name Robert as well as his own, a confused response that would have
devastating results.
</P>
<P>
   A man incapable of making his own breaks, Sanders never got one
along the way. In Los Angeles, he was not given the required
screening that could have revealed his poor mental state. Police
and corrections officials in Los Angeles and New York never noticed
that the photographs of the two men did not match - nor that Robert
had multiple tattoos, while Kerry had only a small one on his hand.
No one saw that the jaywalking ticket Kerry Sanders received in Los
Angeles on July 14, 1993, was issued while Robert Sanders was
serving a three-to-nine-year prison term more than 2,800 miles
away.
</P>
<P>
   No one ever compared the two men's fingerprints and matched them
through the vast national computer database. Had they been checked,
a routine law enforcement practice when a felony suspect is
apprehended, it could have taken just hours to show that Kerry was
the wrong man.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he found himself in the Municipal Court of Los Angeles
the next day, stuck in a holding tank with dozens of other
prisoners awaiting hearings. He was assigned a deputy public
defender, Stanley I. Efron, who met briefly with him, encouraging
him not to fight extradition. Efron said in an interview that he
examined the warrant and noticed the physical discrepancies between
the two men. But he found them to be innocuous, so he asked his
client whether he was Robert Sanders from New York. ``Yes,'' Kerry
replied. Efron explained that if he fought extradition, he would
only prolong his stay in the county jail before being returned to
New York anyway. He said Kerry agreed to sign a waiver.
</P>
<P>
   In his own records, the public defender summarized his meeting
with Kerry Sanders this way: ``Admits ID. Can't bail. Wants to
waive.'' Efron left blank the other sections on the form for
information about the defendant's family, pending cases, prior
record and financial status. Efron, 58, who has worked for 30 years
in the public defender's office, said Kerry ``answered all the
questions, and I was convinced he was the guy.'' It was one of four
extradition cases the public defender handled that morning, and he
remembered Kerry as being subdued and slow. ``I had to explain
things to him more than once,'' Efron recalled. But he said Kerry's
behavior did not set off any alarm bells, nor did the events that
followed.
</P>
<P>
   When Efron gave Kerry copies of the waiver, which began, ``I,
Robert Sanders, do hereby freely and voluntarily state that I am
the identical Robert Sanders,'' he signed them ``Kerry Sanders''
and drew doodles all over one copy. The case then moved to Judge
Abraham A. Khan, who stopped the proceeding after Kerry said he
hadn't even read the form.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you sign it?'' Khan asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Kerry replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did you sign it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because they told me to sign it.''
</P>
<P>
   Khan had the public defender review the form again with his
client. Within minutes, both said it had been read and understood.
``The court is satisfied,'' Khan said, moving on.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry's fate now belonged to New York, and on Oct. 20, Sgt.
Joseph H. Badstein Jr. and another state correctional officer
picked up their prisoner in Los Angeles. It was raining late that
night when Kerry, shackled in leg irons, handcuffs, a waist chain
and black lockbox, arrived with the two officers at the Downstate
Correctional Facility in Fishkill, N.Y., a processing center for
inmates. The watch commander wrote in his logbook: ''11:04 p.m.
Received absconder from Fulton C.F. Sanders, Robert 90 A 8885.'' He
was issued an inmate ID card, which he signed ``Kerry Sanders.''
The corrections department typed ``Kerry Sanders'' into the name
line as well. He was taken to the infirmary, given a delousing
shower and examined by a nurse, Linda A. Rohling. Within 15
minutes, she concluded that he might be mentally ill. Sanders
``claims past psych history,'' Rohling wrote. He had been taking
Haldol, an antipsychotic drug, and Cogentin, which was given to
alleviate the physical side effects of Haldol.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last dose five months ago,'' she noted.
</P>
<P>
   A social worker, Michelyne Duvivier, who examined him the next
morning, checked the records on Robert Sanders, who was in prison
five months earlier, and found no history of mental illness. ``No
records found of psych in prison,'' she wrote. The significance
went unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 12 weeks, Kerry remained in the mental-observation
unit at Downstate, one of 35,801 inmates who entered the New York
State prison system in 1993. Withdrawn and quiet, he paced back and
forth in the unit's recreation area. He giddily said he had
``special powers,'' but they were ``good powers'' he used to help
others. One morning he flooded his cell with water. ``He tried to
'wash his clothing' in the toilet,'' the chart says. ``Sees nothing
unusual about this behavior.'' He also repeatedly asked why he was
locked up, pleading with one nurse, ``When can I go home?'' The
nurse later wrote that he was still confused about where he was,
even claiming ``disbelief that this was a prison.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of December, Kerry was transferred to Green Haven, a
maximum-security prison about 60 miles north of Manhattan. Given
that Robert Sanders had absconded from a minimum-security site, it
was determined that he would require a more secure location. The
New York authorities, now believing they had their man, pulled
Robert Sanders' fugitive warrant from the national computer system.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest of nine children, Kerry Sanders had a singular
connection with his mother, Mary Sanders Lee. When she dropped him
off at elementary school, the teachers told her that she might as
well stay, too, because her son would chase after her anyway. When
Kerry and his friends swooped through the streets on their bikes,
she followed them in her car. ``He was the leader of all
devilment,'' Lee said of her rambunctious son. ``He was a good
little boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry's father, John Sanders, a gas-station attendant in Watts,
was Lee's second husband. She has been married three times and
widowed just as many, and for long periods struggled financially to
support her nine children. As a young child, Kerry had a healthy
mind and body, and his family remembers the little boy who played
with his hamster and his dog and loved to read. ``He was a whiz in
books,'' said his sister Diane, who is three years older than Kerry
and used to get help from him with her homework. But as Kerry got
older, his family life became increasingly turbulent. His father
died when he was a teen-ager. His brother Carl was killed in a
police shooting. Two other brothers were in and out of jail.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Lee hoped Kerry would go to college like another son,
Gilbert, who became a music professor. But her youngest child was
not inter-ested. ``He wasn't going to go to no college,'' she said.
``I wasn't going to make no professor out of him.''
</P>
<P>
   After high school, Kerry enlisted in the Job Corps in San
Bernardino, Calif., where he learned carpentry skills and fell in
love with a girl named Kim, whose name he had tattooed on the back
of his right hand. They had a baby, a daughter. But Kim's parents
didn't approve of him and soon took mother and child away.
</P>
<P>
   By the summer of 1986, when Kerry was 20, psychological problems
began to manifest themselves. He told doctors at one psychiatric
ward that he had been hearing voices for five years. ``He kept the
voices a secret until one month ago, when they became
intolerable,'' a doctor wrote. ``The voices now tell him to kill
himself, and he feels he may lose control.'' The doctors diagnosed
schizophrenia and chronic paranoia and put him on antipsychotic
medication.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next six years, Kerry floated among hospitals, the
streets and the homes of family members, struggling with the
hallucinations and delusions, the disorganized speech and erratic
behavior, caused by his illness. He could be stubborn and
frightening and difficult to control. ``Every once in a while he
would at least come home to eat,'' said a cousin, Linda Evans.
``We'd have to hold him down to get a shower.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Lee welcomed her son at the door when he showed up and
prayed when he left. She took him to psychiatrists and to
hospitals. She befriended the owners of delicatessens, doughnut
shops and check-cashing stores on the streets where Kerry roamed,
asking them to keep an eye out for her son. And she tried to focus
on the better times: Kerry, when stabilized on medication, would
dance with his niece and watch his baby cousin and spend hours at
his mother's home, reading magazines and mysteries and books on
carpentry. He promised to build her a house someday. ``I told him,
'I be so old I won't be able to sit down in it,''' Lee recalled.
``He said, 'Momma, you don't know what I'll do for you, so hush.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1993, Kerry was once again off his medication
and living on the streets, and he was out of touch with his family
for weeks at a time. On July 14, the police stopped him for
crossing against a red light. He was issued a ticket for jaywalking
but did not appear for a hearing. A misdemeanor warrant was issued
for his arrest and entered in the police computer. By late fall,
Lee became alarmed when she still hadn't heard from Kerry and he
hadn't shown up to get his monthly disability check. She said she
took the uncashed check to the Social Security office, telling a
clerk that she had no idea where her son had gone.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 29, 1993, Kerry Sanders arrived at Green Haven, a
sprawling compound of weathered concrete buildings on 928 acres of
Dutchess County farmland. Low-rising corridors connect each of its
nine cellblocks like a maze, giving boundary to several grassy
prison yards and numerous guarded checkpoints. Sanders was
constantly being moved between his cell and the psychiatric ward.
He was a stocky man, soft-fleshed and gentle, and his round face
made him look much younger than his 27 years. From the beginning,
he was a peculiarity to the staff and other inmates - silent,
withdrawn, disoriented.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after his arrival, Sanders met Dr. Chung, the psychiatrist
who would supervise his care. The prisoner was cooperative but had
problems, Chung wrote in the chart. His posture was rigid, his gait
not spontaneous. ``He looks like a zombie,'' the doctor noted,
ordering that Kerry remain on Haldol and stay in the psychiatric
unit ``for closer observation.'' On Jan. 3, 1994, Sanders attended
his first weekly session with the mental health team assigned to
his case. A nurse, Silvia Koola, wrote in his chart that he
``observed that he was confused and does not know why he is in New
York prison; even his homeland is Los Angeles.'' She added, ``He
also was telling he does not know what crime he did and his name is
not Robert.'' In mid-January, Sanders was transferred to the third
tier of A Block, one of several cramped cellblocks on the west side
of the compound, near the psychiatric facility, a prison yard and
the mess hall. At times, the grayness of the place was consumed by
its own monotonous noise, of bars clanging, of inmates being led
through the corridors, of guards yelling out orders and counting
the jumpsuited men in their cells.
</P>
<P>
   It was a world in which Sanders feared to be alone but was more
fearful of being with others. He spent most of his time in his
cell, making occasional trips to the yard to smoke, to watch
television or to play dominos or cards. His counselors remarked
that he befriended no one and that they could not get him to
participate in group activities like the video club or table games.
``He has a psychiatric disorder,'' a social worker, Donald L.
Hanson, noted. ``He needs a supportive environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The staff listened to him talk about his family, his woodworking
and his stays in mental hospitals in California. They wrote it all
down, meticulously. None of it matched the information the prison
system had on Robert Sanders, but no one noticed anyway. Chung
continued to see Kerry regularly, usually once a month, in his
office in the psychiatric unit. The doctor reported after each
session that the patient was ``doing well.'' Other mental health
workers described a grimmer picture.
</P>
<P>
   On the evening of July 7, 1994, a guard found a frightened
Sanders acting bizarrely in his cell and escorted him to the
psychiatric unit. ``He appears somewhat confused,'' wrote Dr.
Stanley Skollar, the psychiatrist on duty. ``He is willing to
accept medication but indicates that because of this 'fright' he
didn't sleep last night and 'will not sleep tonight.' We will give
him his Haldol.''
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 5, Chung wrote in his notes that Sanders said he was
pregnant; the doctor also observed that Sanders was ``doing well''
in his daily activities. That month, Hanson, the social worker,
noted that Sanders was doing poorly in his academic classes. Harold
Roberson, the recreational therapist, wrote that Sanders was
depressed and tired. ``Client continues to feel that we are holding
him here,'' he added, ``often asking when are we going to let him
go home.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 16, Chung wrote that Sanders no longer believed he was
pregnant and that he was doing better in his classes. ``He sleeps
well and eats well.'' One week later, on Sept. 23, Roberson
observed Sanders to be hearing voices and talking to himself. That
same day, Chung noted that he was smiling and laughing
inappropriately. He said he was 24 years old, even though he was
28. ``He is doing well,'' the doctor wrote. On Oct. 20, 1994, as
Sanders' first year in prison ended, Roberson wrote that the
prisoner was still hearing voices and complaining, ``They won't let
me go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Lee tied a handkerchief around her head and set out by bus
and then foot to search the streets of South-Central where she knew
Kerry liked to hang out: Florence, Hoover, Figueroa. She had been
looking for her son for months, knocking on doors, going in and out
of stores and showing Kerry's photograph to as many people as she
could. Her road map, she said, was ``wherever you think his mind
would think to take him.''
</P>
<P>
   The blocks, many of them burned out and deserted, the remnants
of the Rodney King rioting in 1992, were controlled by rival gangs,
and Lee, 60 and practical, did not hesitate to rely on them to help
her on her way. When she finished on one block, gang members guided
her to the next one, whistling loudly as they passed her into new
territory. She changed the handkerchief around her head to match
the next gang's colors and kept going.
</P>
<P>
   The search was exhausting. One day, dispirited, she found
herself being encouraged by a young boy who walked alongside her.
``Mary Mother, she been crying like you when Jesus was missing them
three years,'' he told her. ``So you crying about your son? What
about Jesus, who died for us?'' It was ``the beautifulest thing
that I ever heard a young boy tell me in my life,'' said Lee, the
granddaughter of a Baptist minister. ``I really did step fast then,
when that child told me that.''
</P>
<P>
   She felt driven to find her son, she said, despite the
conviction of family members that her search was futile. Some of
her children suggested that she hold a memorial service for Kerry
and grew concerned when she said she could hear his voice. ``Round
by dusk, dark, I could hear him calling,'' Lee explained. ``I could
hear the sound of keys, the rattling of keys. I kept telling them:
'Well, he's got to be somewhere, kidnapped. Somebody got him
somewhere locked up, and he can't get to me. I keep hearing him
say, 'Momma,' and I know I'm not going crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   She combed the parks, skid row and hospitals and pleaded with
the homeless. She sent Kerry's picture to the Sally Jessy Raphael
show after seeing a program about missing family members. And she
forced herself to make trips to the county morgue, where she asked
about the latest ``John Doe'' bodies. ``I didn't have it in my
heart that my son was dead,'' Lee said. ``If he's dead, I'm dead.''
</P>
<P>
   She became a regular at the police station in her neighborhood,
seeking out officers who patrolled the streets and knew her son.
When she wasn't at the station house, she was phoning the officers
there to see if there was any news. ``Did you pick him up or
anything?'' she asked them. ``I hope I'll find him 'fore you do.''
</P>
<P>
   When Kerry Sanders arrived at Green Haven, his hold on reality
was faint and fragile: he knew his name, he knew details about his
family and life in Los Angeles and he remembered his time in the
Job Corps. By the fall of 1994, as he entered his second year in
the prison, that thread of sanity was all but vanished. As the
voices in his head grew louder, so did his chattering. ``He said he
was aware of it and it will not happen again,'' Hanson wrote after
other prisoners complained that Sanders was keeping them up at
night. As the months dragged on, so did Sanders' solitary routines.
``He rarely comes to staff to complain about anything except, 'When
am I going to be let out of here?''' Roberson observed on Nov. 23,
1994.
</P>
<P>
   There was a widespread view among the staff that Sanders'
questioning did not need to be investigated. Juan Villalba, a
correctional officer assigned to inmates with psychiatric problems,
would later say that Sanders came to him at least once a week,
asking: ``Mr. Poncho, when they going to let me go? I didn't do
nothing.'' Villalba, who said he heard such complaints from many
prisoners, humored Sanders, saying he would be released ``one of
these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael S. Rassin, another recreational therapist, would also
later acknowledge that Sanders possibly said to him as many as 75
times, ``I don't know why I'm here.'' Rassin told him to write to
the superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of 1995, Sanders' questioning became more frequent
as he grew more desperate. The psychiatric chart shows:
</P>
<P>
   January: Admits he hears voices. States he is depressed because
he is in prison and there is nothing he can do about it.
</P>
<P>
   March: Says we are holding him here because he committed no
crimes. Will be encouraged to come to the staff and talk when he
feels he has a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Chung said in a recent interview that he saw his job as limited
to treating the patient's psychotic symptoms, not exploring his
claims of wrongful imprisonment. ``Not my responsibility,'' he
said. Chung was the only employee at Green Haven who agreed to be
interviewed for this article. At 71, he is a veteran of the state
system, having spent 10 years at Green Haven before recently moving
to another prison. Born in North Korea, he escaped at the age of 15
to the South, where he went on to attend medical school. In 1977,
he moved to the United States and completed a residency in
psychiatry.
</P>
<P>
   At Green Haven, he said he saw 50 to 75 patients a week and did
not remember the Sanders case specifically, but after reviewing a
copy of his handwritten notes in the chart, he confirmed his
participation. Chung said that many prisoners made claims of
innocence: ``Ninety-nine percent of people deny that they are
criminals.'' He said some of his patients ``claim they came from
heaven, and some of those, that they are Jesus Christ.'' By the
summer of 1995, the line between reality and delusion disappeared
for Sanders. Some members of the staff were calling him Kerry as
well as Robert. The chart continues:
</P>
<P>
   June: ``I hear these voices.'' Says he sees his mother in the
prison. august: Says people are coming out of the walls. Unable to
sleep.
</P>
<P>
   September: Expressing thoughts about being held in prison by the
staff against his will.
</P>
<P>
   A man who was known on the streets as ``chicken'' was waiting
for the bus and 26 pounds of crack cocaine at the Greyhound
terminal in Cleveland on Oct. 7, 1995, when the federal agents
showed up. The Drug Enforcement Administration had been tipped off
about the drug deal, but its agents had no idea what else they were
about to discover when they made their arrest. The man they
apprehended had a muscular build and a long face. He had many
tattoos and scars. He showed them a license bearing the name
Laradney J. Dixon and an address in Cleveland. One agent suspected
that it was a fake, especially after noticing that one tattoo on
his arm read ``Robert.''
</P>
<P>
   Unsure of the man's identity, the agents took fingerprints and
sent them to the FBI in Washington. Within hours, the DEA learned
that the prints matched those of a felon named Robert Sanders. But
he was supposedly sitting in a prison in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Lillian Capuano was working as a clerk in charge of inmate
records at Green Haven when the DEA's call came in. An agent told
her he had the fugitive Robert Sanders in custody. She said that
was impossible; he was already at Green Haven. The agent, to prove
his contention, asked her to send Robert Sanders' fingerprints to
the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Capuano, suspicious, noted in a memo that she called the bureau
to verify that the DEA's request was real. Reassured, she sent the
prints the prison system had on file for Robert Sanders, taken
during his initial imprisonment in 1990. They matched those of the
man arrested in Cleveland. Mystified, officials at Green Haven then
fingerprinted the inmate they had imprisoned for two years as
Robert Sanders. In all the time since Kerry's arrest on the bench
in Los Angeles, this was the first instance his prints had been
taken and examined. They matched none in the FBI's files. On Oct.
26, Capuano began to pore through prison records and discovered
that since the inmate was brought back to New York, he had been
``signing Kerry Sanders, not Robert Sanders.''
</P>
<P>
   ater that day, George W. Seyfert 3rd, a deputy inspector general
with the New York State Department of Correctional Services, was
called to Green Haven and began his own review of the files on
Robert Sanders. They showed that Robert Sanders had been arrested
several times before he shot a man over cocaine in Harlem in 1990.
He was sentenced to three to nine years in prison. He was
fingerprinted, photographed and assigned identification No. 90 A
8885. A clerk wrote that he was ``adjusting without incident'' and
that he had no medical or psychiatric problems. The files also
showed that after three years in the New York system, Robert
Sanders was moved to Fulton State Correctional Facility in the
Bronx. Under its work-release program, he was allowed to leave each
morning at 8 to work in a Harlem barbershop. He came back every day
at 3, except on Aug. 30, 1993, when he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   At 12:30 p.m. on Oct. 26, 1995, Seyfert, who had settled into a
conference room that is used for parole hearings, called for the
``inmate who claims to be Kerry Sanders.'' He looked at Kerry and
at the photograph of Robert Sanders. There was no resemblance. Over
the next hour, Seyfert questioned Kerry, who responded slowly,
mumbling and slurring his words at times. But the inspector heard
and wrote down what he needed to know: Kerry Sanders. Date of
birth: June 25, 1966. Born in Los Angeles in a hospital near the
Coliseum where the Rams played. His father was John Sanders; he
died in 1982. His mother was Mary. His sister was Roberta. He had a
brother who died. He named his other brothers: Don, Rickey,
Gilbert. He gave his Social Security number. ``I used to work as a
carpenter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry told Seyfert that he was arrested for ``sleeping on a park
bench'' in Los Angeles. He said he answered to the name Robert
after his arrest there but had never used the name before that.
Seyfert asked him if he ever did anything wrong. Kerry began to
ramble on about an incident in which he said he shot a wall while
baby-sitting in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Had he ever done anything else wrong? Seyfert asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Masturbate _that's it,'' Kerry said.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector had one more question. ``How are you doing here?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm OK,'' Kerry replied. ``It's good here, but you wouldn't
like it.''
</P>
<P>
   With Robert Sanders now in federal custody in Cleveland in the
crack cocaine case, the authorities in New York were determined to
have him serve out the remaining time on his original state
sentence. So they reposted the warrant for his arrest in the
national database.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Seyfert began trying to reach Kerry's family. On the
afternoon of Oct. 27, he tracked down Mary Lee's phone number and
began dialing. She picked up the phone. Seyfert asked her to hold
for a minute, and then put Kerry on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello? Yes _ Momma?''
</P>
<P>
   Five hours after Seyfert's phone call, Sergeant Badstein, one of
the New York correctional officers who flew to Los Angeles two
years earlier, took Kerry back home. ``Here come Kerry with a red
sweater on and some blue jeans, and he's so glad to see his Momma,
he didn't know what to do,'' Lee remembered. ``I said: 'Where your
coat at? You been in New York? You mean to tell me that you didn't
have no coat on up in New York? You get devil cold.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lee hugged her son and hugged the two Los Angeles police
officers who escorted him from the airport. She invited them in for
coffee as she and her family celebrated Kerry's return, but the
officers declined. Badstein, in a memo to his supervisor, seemed
pleased with Lee's reaction and that New York's role had remained
largely invisible. ``She was only interested in his safe return,''
Badstein wrote, adding that Kerry's mother ``thanked us
profusely.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that there were ``no press or media cameras or the
like'' and that Lee ``did not ask my name, nor did anyone else in
her apartment. No identification was requested and none was
offered. All parties seemed satisfied to see only the uniforms of
the LAPD escorts.'' Badstein said he left Kerry with nothing that
``bore the name'' of Green Haven or the New York corrections
department. Kerry was sent home with $48.13, a plastic bag with
some medicine, a soda and a pack of cigarettes _ but with no
explanation for his imprisonment or recommendations on following up
his psychiatric care. It was Kerry who told his family about his
time in prison. ``They took me to New York,'' he said to his sister
Roberta. ``It was so cold there. They put me in this little room.''
</P>
<P>
   Then his family tried to find out more. His mother ultimately
contacted Green Haven's superintendent, Christopher P. Artuz. ``My
son is mentally challenged,'' she wrote on Dec. 6, 1995. ``He does
not remember everything, and I need this information.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony J. Annucci, deputy commissioner and the top lawyer for
the corrections department, responded two months later. He
suggested that Kerry was mostly to blame for his imprisonment,
noting that he had answered to ``Robert'' at the time of his arrest
and in Green Haven. ``The diminished mental faculties of Kerry
Sanders apparently were a significant reason why this error went
undetected for as long as it had,'' Annucci wrote. ``I deeply
regret any hardship to Kerry Sanders and his family occasioned by
this case of mistaken identity.''
</P>
<P>
   In the two years after Kerry's release, his family said they saw
a disturbed man deteriorate further. ``He wasn't the same,''
Roberta said. He had flashbacks and shortness of breath. He told
his sister and her daughter that he had been sexually assaulted in
prison. When he slept at Roberta's house, he kept the lights on.
When they watched television, she said he would suddenly shout as
if he were back in his cell, ``Man, leave my stuff alone!'' or
``Don't get on my bunk.'' His moods grew more erratic, his behavior
more volatile. He went on and off his medication and often went
back to the streets.
</P>
<P>
   On the evening of Jan. 10, 1997, two officers spotted Kerry
crossing against a ``Don't Walk'' sign on Florence Avenue, forcing
cars to brake suddenly as they exited the freeway. They stopped him
and asked him for his name and birth date. They radioed the
information to the dispatcher and heard back about the felony
warrant for Robert Sanders from New York. The police in Los Angeles
apparently did not notice that Robert Sanders was in prison in the
federal cocaine case. The officers pressed ahead.
</P>
<P>
   According to their report, they asked Kerry whether he knew
there was a warrant for him in New York and he responded: ``Yes, I
was there 10 months ago, and I used the name Robert Sanders. Here,
in California, I use the name Kerry Sanders so no one will know I'm
Robert Sanders.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Sanders was booked and jailed as Robert Sanders, with
``Kerry'' listed as an alias. Again, the police did not check
fingerprints. They notified prison authorities in New York that
they had Robert Sanders in custody. Three days later, New York said
to let him go, and the case was dismissed. ``Wrong suspect,
exonerated,'' the police report says. When he saw his mother, Kerry
told her what happened. ``I been in jail for Robert Sanders
again,'' he said. ``Momma, they cannot keep Robert Sanders in jail.
He got to do his own time by himself, Momma.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because you're paranoid, doesn't mean they're not out to
get you.'' So read the sign hanging in the waiting room of the
psychiatric unit at Green Haven when Benjamin Schonbrun, a lawyer
in a small civil rights practice in Los Angeles, visited the prison
in May. Its sting was not lost on Schonbrun, who went there to talk
to staff members who treated Kerry during his time there.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after her son's return, Mary Lee hired Schonbrun's firm
to file a federal civil rights lawsuit against the authorities in
New York and Los Angeles. Five years later, they are still trying
to sort out moral, legal and financial responsibility for what
happened. Lee hopes that any damages will enable her son to afford
better psychiatric care, a wish that has become a backdrop of the
case.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit argues that Kerry's imprisonment not only damaged
his already poor mental health but has also had residual effects in
the years since his return home. In the spring of 1998, he was
arrested three times. The police said he defaced a window at a Jack
in the Box, destroyed a beauty shop door and was found one day with
a semiautomatic rifle he had picked out of a garbage bin.
</P>
<P>
   This January, the law firm negotiated a $290,000 settlement with
Los Angeles County for its role in the case. In a letter to the
county board of supervisors, the county's own lawyers sharply
criticized the police, the public defender and jail officials,
noting that the most basic screening tools of law enforcement,
fingerprints and photographs, were abandoned. ``Further,'' the
county's lawyers wrote, ``there was no suspicion that Kerry Lee
Sanders suffered from mental illness that would have alerted
individuals to the fact that they might have the wrong person in
custody.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the attorney general's office has chosen to fight
the lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, not disputing that
Kerry was wrongly imprisoned but denying any liability. It first
claimed that the suit should be dismissed because the statute of
limitations had run out; it soon withdrew that argument. It also
contended that to bring the suit, Kerry had to meet strict legal
requirements that apply to prisoners. Judge Deborah A. Batts, who
has not hid her disdain for some of the state's arguments, found
this one to be ``without merit.'' The requirements didn't apply,
she ruled, because Kerry shouldn't have been a prisoner in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   State officials, including spokesmen for the Department of
Correctional Services, the Office of Mental Health _ which runs the
psychiatric unit at Green Haven _ and the attorney general's office
have refused to comment because of the pending lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Shechtman, a former federal prosecutor who oversaw the
correctional system from 1995 to 1996 as the criminal justice
adviser to Pataki, called the case remarkable. ``Whatever else,''
Shechtman said, ``it does seem that it's appropriate for the state
to say mea culpa.''
</P>
<P>
   As recently as this spring, the state attorney general's office
informed Kerry's lawyers that except for the psychiatric records,
all other files pertaining to his two years in the prison had been
lost. A trial date has not been set.
</P>
<P>
   Since last October, Schonbrun and two of his partners, Wilmer J.
Harris and Michael D. Seplow, have been taking depositions from
prison and mental health employees involved in the case. Almost all
those involved see themselves as blameless, saying they were not
responsible for checking into Sanders' claims of innocence. ``I let
him know there was nothing I could do,'' said Michael Rassin, the
recreational therapist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a legal aid society,'' Harold Roberson, the other
recreational therapist, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not my job _ I don't do that,'' said Silvia Koola, the
nurse. Questioned about Kerry's release from Green Haven, Sergeant
Badstein, the correctional officer who wrote to his boss that he
did not show ID when he accompanied Kerry home, said, ``All of our
transports are low profile.'' Badstein also now maintains that he
told Mary Lee who he was.
</P>
<P>
   Seyfert, the deputy inspector general, asked whether he arranged
any follow-up care for Kerry, said it was not the state's
responsibility. ``My jurisdiction ended at the door of the Green
Haven Correctional Facility.'' Seyfert, who has worked for the
corrections department for 25 years, said the Sanders case was the
only one he was aware of in the state system in which an innocent
man, unable to speak for himself, was picked up and put in jail in
place of an escaped convict. He acknowledged, however, that he had
not investigated whether there were any other such cases.
</P>
<P>
   In the suit, the lawyers also contend that Kerry was sexually
assaulted in prison and that his comments to the staff that he was
pregnant should have been seen as a sign from a mentally ill man
that he was raped. Chung, asked in his interview about Kerry's
pregnancy comment, said it can be viewed only one way: ``Just
nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think it makes any sense that a male is pregnant?''
Chung asked. ``If the patient is female, then it can make sense.
Maybe rape or some relationship. Even if he had a relationship with
others, a male can't be pregnant.'' Asked whether Kerry might have
been signaling that he had been raped, Chung said, ``We say, G-O-K
_ God only knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the more than 20 people who have testified in depositions or
been interviewed for this article, only one official expressed
shock at Kerry's imprisonment. Wayne L. Strack, a deputy
commissioner for corrections at the time, said he was
``flabbergasted'' when he learned about the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the checks and balances that we've got, I can't
understand how it happened,'' Strack said in a deposition. ``I
mean, it's drilled in you from Day 1 of the job: You take an
inmate, you're responsible, you identify him. I mean _ my mind goes
boggled.'' He said the responsibility was broad because ``too many
things happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The issues of responsibility and culpability, of quality of care
and of monumental and systematic failings continue to surround the
lawsuit. Yet in 2,000 pages of depositions, there have been few
displays of compassion and fewer of outrage. At Green Haven, no one
on the staff was even told what happened, and no one asked. One
day, Kerry Sanders just disappeared. Chung, only recently learning
the details, said it was better for Kerry to be in prison than
wandering the streets. ``He got medication, free meal, food,
everything,'' the doctor said in his deposition. ``He should say,
'Thank you, for two years you guys treated me very nicely.'''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Sanders turned 34 on June 25 and he says he is ``ready for
the future.'' Since March, he has been staying at a supervised
board-and-care residence in Los Angeles, where he has his own room
and a structured schedule. A psychiatrist visits him once a month,
and a nurse dispenses his medication, cooks his meals, organizes
his activities and makes sure he rises each day at 6 so he will be
ready for a van that takes him to a therapy center for counseling
and classes.
</P>
<P>
   His room at the residence is spare but neat, and he has his own
stereo. He spends his time playing cassettes _ the Temptations and
Tyrone Davis are among his favorites _ watching Superman cartoons
and talking with his housemates. ``Two girls and six guys _ and
me,'' Kerry said in one of several recent interviews. He can sign
out to walk to a nearby park or to a grocery store, where he buys
cigarettes and chips. His mother, now 67, visits him regularly, and
she can take him home on weekends to her apartment in Inglewood,
where he can see his sisters and their children.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry remains stocky, his movement slowed by medication, his
speech tentative, his memory clouded. But he can recall some of his
two years at the prison. ``When I got invited to go to New York, I
don't know what happened,'' he said. ``They picked me up, and they
asked me if I was Kerry Sanders or Robert Sanders. I told them my
name was Kerry Sanders.'' ``It was just horrible,'' he added.
``Going in and out of cells every day. Going to dinner. Standing at
attention.'' He cried and prayed a lot. ``I wanted to get out, and
I wanted to come home,'' Kerry said. ``It was like losing oxygen.''
</P>
<P>
   After so many chaotic years, Kerry's life is more stable now,
and he seems unencumbered by bitterness or anger over what happened
to him. Yet he has a sad resignation about what he knows his future
will mean. ``It will be the same as it is today,'' Kerry said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Sanders remains in federal prison in the Cleveland drug
case, serving a 15-year sentence. New York still has the warrant
out for his arrest.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Jimmy Iovine, co-chairman of Interscope Geffen A&AMP;M, slips the
videocassette in the player and plunks down in a comfy chair. He's
screening an early episode of ``Farmclub.com,'' a weekly music show
he's producing on the USA network. ``Farmclub'' runs right after
the World Wrestling Federation's ``Raw Is War,'' a
let-them-eat-beefcake extravaganza that is cable TV's highest-rated
show. The conjunction was no accident. Iovine avidly pursued it
because he wanted to capture the young males who watch wrestling.
The star of this episode is unquestionably Fred Durst, front man
for Limp Bizkit, a group that minted rap-metal, the aggressive,
hypermacho and extremely lucrative new pop-music genre that mixes
rap with rock. ``Watch this,'' Iovine says. ``This is what
'Farmclub' is all about.'' Just then, on the tape, Durst, enraged
that the show has just run the wrong version of a Limp Bizkit
video, threatens to hide a TV camera somewhere on the person of a
staff member.
</P>
<P>
   This attitude is quite possibly the future of white male youth
culture _ camera-ready anger, staged to resemble wrestling. Iovine
is an entrepreneur of rage. He linked arms with the rap label Death
Row in the early '90s and made the gangsta rappers Snoop Dogg and
Dr. Dre household names. He signed Nine Inch Nails, whose
transgressive lyrics are the target of Washington conservatives,
and he, along with Dr. Dre, brought the world Eminem, the
anti-role-model white rapper who has recently been embroiled in a
public dust-up over virulent antigay lyrics. Iovine sees a great
future ahead for artists who take hip-hop in new directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you understand the impact on young white America that
hip-hop is having?'' he asks. To illustrate, he searches his Los
Angeles office for the FBI tally of crime statistics he keeps close
at hand. ``Crime has gone down remarkably. And rap music has been
the biggest it's ever been. So do guys like Tupac and DMX deserve
the Nobel Peace Prize? I don't know. What do you think?'' He's
joking, but only just.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder that Iovine frequently ponders the connections
between outrageous music and outrageous behavior, if only because
his artists and others like them often have a foot on both sides of
the line. Take last year's Woodstock, where rap-metal had its messy
coming out. The artists Rage Against the Machine, Korn, the Insane
Clown Posse and Everlast all played there, all of them fusing heavy
guitar sounds to boastful, profane hip-hop attitude. Promoters were
hoping for a nice millennial assortment of good vibes, while
audiences and artists clearly wanted to carve out a nastier slice
of history. It was Durst who put his finger on the scale. Before
the sea of Woodstock humanity, he announced: ``They want us to ask
you to mellow out. They said too many people are getting hurt.
Don't let nobody get hurt, but I don't think you should mellow
out.'' And then the seams split open. Limp Bizkit played their
testosterone-drenched ``Break Stuff,'' and the mood changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Break Stuff'' rants against ``the he says-she says'' and
builds to a vow to ``break your ... face tonight.'' That's the
quintessential rap-rock moment, when everyday pressures and the old
he says-she says ignites in an updraft of rage. At Woodstock one
woman was reportedly raped as Limp Bizkit played, and a gang rape
allegedly occurred while the band Korn performed. Crisis counselors
say there were even more attacks, and at party's end, fires broke
out all over the grounds as rock fans trashed vehicles, automatic
teller machines and vendor stalls. There were few reports of
anybody mellowing out.
</P>
<P>
   Iovine thinks those who link Limp Bizkit to the Woodstock melee
miss the point. Earlier that day, he informs me, a 6-year-old
Michigan youth shot and killed another child. Iovine's artists have
been blamed before when fans have engaged in criminal behavior, so
he is quick to say now that music is not responsible for the
Michigan killing. While he laments what happened at Woodstock, he
contends that pushing audiences to respond is what great art does.
</P>
<P>
   I grew up in Detroit _ rap-metal's ground zero, home to Kid
Rock, Eminem and the Insane Clown Posse _ and I knew people who
needed Kid Rock in their lives, an artist raising the self-esteem
of doormats everywhere. The last time I saw my best friend from
high school, he was standing on the hood of his car, smashing in
the windows with his dad's golf clubs. I bet today he and his
children are Kid Rock fans. Boasting that he comes ``straight out
of the trailer,'' Rock hurls the epithet of ``white trash'' back at
the world, much in the same way gangsta groups like NWA did with
Compton and ``nigga.'' At its best, the current fusion of rap and
metal lets people who feel unblessed by the economy express some
righteous anger. But more often, rap-metal aims a lot lower.
</P>
<P>
   The new rap-metal frequently seems calculated _ to offend, to
rake in a quick, lewd buck. The influence of pornography on this
culture is worth noting. The band Korn, for example, garnered early
credibility among fans by posting interviews with porn stars on its
Web site. The Insane Clown Posse goes on cable-access porn shows.
Fred Durst appeared in ``Backstage Sluts 2.'' Porn gives bands cool
points and boosts their fan base.
</P>
<P>
   There is something creepy about the ongoing compulsion to wed
rap and metal and from there to fuse it with wrestling and porn and
seemingly every other precinct in popular culture. And it hasn't
peaked yet. Recently, Eminem's new album broke records for
first-week sales.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the music itself can sometimes be profound. Eminem, in
his brilliant ``Guilty Conscience,'' ponders robbing a liquor
store, taking advantage of a 15-year-old and killing a cheating
wife. He gleefully forces you to consider whatever differences
exist between thoughts and deeds while making you extremely
uncomfortable to discover that maybe the two aren't far enough
apart. (And judging from recent reports of his offstage behavior,
words and deeds might not be so distant for Eminem, either.) It is
about the meaninglessness of good intentions and maybe even the
death of them.
</P>
<P>
   Call them knuckleheads or young white guys; Spin magazine
lambasted them with the term ``mooks,'' a label that has since been
picked up as a badge of honor. And suddenly there are enough
members of the mook club to fill up many Woodstocks. We've all seen
them at the mall: kids who ostentatiously say ``whuzzup'' to one
another; the frat brothers who wear stop-and-frisk fashions; the
countless fans who recognize the porn star on the cover of
Blink-182's last album.
</P>
<P>
   White music fans have long been curious about black culture, but
the wholesale interest in miming the black underclass is new. As
far back as ``On the Road,'' Jack Kerouac fantasized raptly, ``At
lilac evening I walked with every muscle aching ... wishing I were
a Negro, feeling that the best the white world offered was not
enough ecstasy for me, not enough life, joy, kicks, darkness,
music, not enough night.''
</P>
<P>
   James Brown fascinated white kids in the '60s with a peephole
glimpse of a world of grace and grit. But the black rapper DMX, and
before him Tupac Shakur and Notorious B.I.G., now offers a
wide-screen movie of ghetto life, relishing the details, relating
the intricacy of topics like drug dealing, brawling, pimping and
black-on-black crime. Rap makes these things seem sexy, and it
makes life on the streets seem as thrilling as a Playstation game.
</P>
<P>
   Today black youth culture is no secret, nor is it about joy and
kicks. Today a thousand arena spotlights shine on such race
fantasies, and they are billboarded and exploited by media outlets
and entertainment conglomerates. The fantasy lands of rap,
wrestling and porn have aligned to shape a real audience, one that
looks awfully hardened. Woodstockers have been called spoiled
brats, pacified suburbanites, testosterone junkies with no real
reason to be angry. Their crime, to their critics, is one of
insincerity. It's a powerful argument. But once the windows start
breaking, rage isn't really earned or counterfeit. It just is. And
at that point, rage is no longer the problem of a group of problem
kids. At that moment, it's everybody's problem.
</P>
<P>
   The literature of mookography is full of family turmoil, of
parents and children turning on one another. Take the weekly saga
(run between matches) involving the WWF overlord McMahon and his
kids, who wrestle, turn very, very bad, ``marry'' wrestlers Dad
doesn't approve of, get ``gang raped'' and so on. Even professional
wrestling is about family excess.
</P>
<P>
   Making parents mad and recounting family tensions have always
been a part of rock 'n' roll since Daddy took the T-Bird away, but
today's full-out family trauma is different, and part of what makes
rap-metal stand out in comparison with the other top-ranking pop
music, teen bubble gum. Eminem raps about discovering that his
mother was a drug addict. In real life, she's suing him for $10
million for defamation of character. Kid Rock once told an
interviewer that he found career motivation in being kicked out of
his parents' house for refusing to go to family therapy. The band
Korn once put out a news release stating that some of its members
were child-abuse survivors. Fans know the lyrics and the back
stories and are drawn in because in these stories, they see
something of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Fred Durst, the man who has taken lumps for
``triggering'' Woodstock, hedges his bets, sounding simultaneously
apologetic and defiant. ``I literally don't do anything to hurt
anyone,'' Durst says. ``I believe in karma more than you
understand. And I believe in God. And when I'm at Woodstock and a
riot breaks out _ I didn't know. Everybody's jumping and I can't
see and all of a sudden there's these riots and someone got raped.
Dude, if I'd known that, I would have stopped it.''
</P>
<P>
   He calls ``Break Stuff,'' the song he played when the mood
palpably changed at Woodstock, ``a mistake,'' which he won't repeat
on the next Bizkit album. But he's not ready to shoulder all the
blame: ``They burned the place down, but it's not my fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Durst, 29, grew up in Gastonia, N.C., a small town where one of
his best friends was a black kid whose father, a D.J., played Fred
rap records that he had bought in New York. ``All of a sudden I was
obsessed with this beat and this way of storytelling,'' Durst
explains. ``And I thought, Man, I tell you what, this has got to be
the best thing that's ever happened in my life.'' He became a
figure common everywhere today: the white kid with the boom box,
the stylized walk, the pants flashing boxers. Before this kid was
an archetype, though, he was more likely to be called weird, or
worse. In a place like Gastonia, and then Jacksonville, Fla., where
his family moved, Durst was called ``nigger lover.''
</P>
<P>
   He joined a break-dance crew _ four black kids and him _ and won
the seventh-grade talent show. But after that, things were
different at school. Suddenly all the jocks wanted to beat him up,
he says, ``and anybody that was, like, 'normal' said, 'Hey this
guy's a freak.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the years after school, Durst fathered a child, spent a year
in the Navy, worked as a tattoo artist and then formed a band. The
mid-90's was a savvy moment to create a new sound. Jordan Schur,
who founded Limp Bizkit's label, Flip, explains: ``Rock had kind of
fizzled, and a lot of these young kids in the suburbs, the
skatekids, they wanted a rock-star element. They were getting more
of that from rap. But a lot of those kids still liked the big riffs
and the big sound of rock. It was natural to go toward a fusion of
the two.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, in the Los Angeles rehearsal studio, standing among
mannequins of monsters, the members of Limp Bizkit don't look like
teen-age icons. Durst sits on a couch, repairing a skateboard as
the rest of the group sets up. The band plays four songs that this
fall, on their next album, ``Chocolate Starfish and Hotdog Flavored
Water,'' will continue posing the argument that hip-hop is white
culture too.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is happy with where the music is going. The
African-American rapper Mos Def pointedly attacks Limp Bizkit
(along with Elvis and Kenny G) on his recent album ``Black on Both
Sides,'' recasting a familiar charge that hip-hop and rock 'n' roll
are both black music that whites have appropriated. He is in some
ways right.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Limp Bizkit continues to pursue total world
domination. Durst has become a senior vice president at Interscope
Records; as a high-ranking talent scout, he envisions huge
battles-of-the-bands traveling across the country, with the best
getting signed to his label. And Durst says he has raised
``hundreds of thousands of dollars'' for a cable channel featuring
round-the-clock extreme sports and music programming.
</P>
<P>
   It's not even his most ambitious project. He hopes to erase the
blot of Woodstock with a huge festival of hard-core hip-hop and
rap-metal, the edgiest stuff he can get. He would like to line up
Korn, the Ruff Ryders, Wu-Tang Clan, Dr. Dre and Eminem and more.
The show will be free, and he's toying with the idea of making the
food and drinks free, too, a rebuke to Woodstock's $12 pizzas. And
he vows to make it violence-free.
</P>
<P>
   The responsibility weighs heavily on Durst's sloping shoulders.
``Pretty much everybody says our generation has this problem,'' he
says. ``We were the problem at Woodstock. But you know what? I'll
put together the heaviest rock and hip-hop bands, and it will be
the most peaceful, fun, killer event you'll ever see.'' It's a long
way from happening, though. Should it work, a generation will have
a whole new set of defining symbols. And one of them will be
wearing a red baseball cap backward.

 By STEVE ERICKSON  
 c.2000 Steve Erickson  
 From The New York Times Magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Follow the crack of the Liberty Bell as far as the eye can see
and there he is, alone on a park bench in the middle of
Philadelphia, as obscure as he wants to be. ``Getting a little
vitamin D,'' he says when I reach him, and lifts his face to the
first sun either of us has seen after 15 hours on a bus, riding the
interstate through the night and into this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   He's as obscure as he wants to be _ except for all those tour
buses parked on the other side of the square, his in particular,
with the tops of two '49 Buick Roadmasters erupting through the
roof and a license plate that reads POCAHONTAS. For a while we talk
about the allure of the road (``I like it,'' he says, ``I mean, I
miss my family, but. ...'' and then shrugs, a concession not an
apology), the music he listens to (``I don't play that much pop
these days, mostly Beethoven, Wagner''), about his recent CD,
``Silver and Gold'' (his first studio recording in four years). We
talk about the eight-disc archival box set he's preparing for
release this fall, covering his ascent from obscurity in the
mid-'60s to 1972, when he had Billboard's No. 1 album of the year;
and the two tours he's staging, one on his own and one with three
old friends, who, 30 years ago, were the biggest band in America.
</P>
<P>
   Time has finally cornered him long enough to monumentalize him,
it seems; but we'll see. Once he wrote songs with titles like
``Journey Through the Past'' _ barely conscious efforts to conquer
the present and cheat the future _ and he has always given a very
good impression of a man running from his place in musical history
as if it were a tomb. When we make our way to the hotel where the
bus is parked, a fan works up the nerve to ask for an autograph,
but Neil Young says, ``No, I don't do that,'' and walks right on
by, breaking his stride not even a little.
</P>
<P>
   Until I actually step on board, everyone assures me the
Pocahontas is a sanctuary never breached. Back beyond the special
well designed for Ben, his 21-year-old son with cerebral palsy who
watches the highway from his wheelchair, Young sprawls on his huge
bed. ``I was playing in a club in Fort William,'' he begins, ``and
we're doing a song called 'Farmer John,' and toward the end of it
we started jamming. ...''
</P>
<P>
   This is way back. This is back in the autumn of 1964 with a band
called the Squires, in Canada, where Young was reared in the little
town of Omemee with its ``blue, blue windows behind the stars'' and
where at the age of 3 he slipped into a nearby lake and nearly
drowned. This is back before his early days as part of a Motown
band with Rick James, back before his long exodus to L.A. in a
hearse looking for Stephen Stills, whom he would find only at the
last minute in a Sunset Strip traffic jam, before they formed
Buffalo Springfield. This is before ``After the Gold Rush'' and
``Harvest'' put him on the map in the early 1970s, and before the
subsequent 28 albums that have kept him on and off the map ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   This is way back, before a crumbling spinal disc in 1971 and
before the epilepsy, which still haunts him onstage. This is before
the afternoon he fired his lead guitarist for an uncontrolled
heroin problem that took the guitarist's life that very night, and
before the subsequent music that Young recorded in a
tequila-flooded exorcism of grief and guilt. This is before the
Thermidor of late-'70s punk, when one rock icon after another fell
before its guillotine of cultural relevancy, and Young was the one
'60s artist not only spared by the revolution but also embraced as
a kindred spirit.
</P>
<P>
   This is back before the nitwitted lawsuit filed against him in
the '80s by the head of his record label, David Geffen, for not
making true ``Neil Young'' records, before the '90s, when Kurt
Cobain quoted him in his suicide note, before he became the only
artist in the year 2000 that one could possibly imagine sharing a
concert bill with, say, Merle Haggard on the one hand and Nine Inch
Nails on the other. This is back before he became rock's Man That
Time Forgot, making music at once primordial and futuristic,
homegrown and surreal, traditional and insurrectionist, beguiling
and cataclysmic _ before he became, with his distinctive voice and
racked Mojave-storm guitar, a one-man vortex for folk, country,
blues, psychedelia, grunge, electronica, symphonic sweep, metallic
squall.
</P>
<P>
   Way back, playing ``Farmer John'' when he wasn't yet 20, Young
remembers, the music got really wild. ``I had never played like
that before. We were just slamming it. We played the song without
the song, we played what the song was about,'' and in that moment
his musical identity was born. If rock has always been driven by
two impulses, the utopian and the anarchic, many of its most
enduring figures have straddled the two: Chuck Berry, Elvis
Presley, John Lennon, Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, Neil Young. It's the
utopian Neil whose records people buy in droves. But with songs
like 1995's sonic Imax ``I'm the Ocean,'' or the brilliant
``Powderfinger,'' about a young frontier boy killed in an explosion
of survivalist pride and madness (``Then I saw black, and my face
splashed in the sky''), it's the anarchic Neil who howls into the
zeitgeist and alters it.
</P>
<P>
   He likes it when the zeitgeist howls back. With Crazy Horse, a
band just cacophonous and primal enough to capture ``Farmer John''
on record with Young a quarter-century after Fort William, he makes
a point of recording around a full moon, when ``a lot of mechanical
things go wrong, technical difficulties, things that usually work
don't work.'' And in the congenitally enlightened company of
Crosby, Stills and Nash, unabashed utopians who have always sounded
a little funny singing ``Down by the river I shot my baby,'' Neil
Young is Baader-Meinhof: when he performs ``Rockin' in the Free
World'' in Philadelphia, it seems he simply won't let go of the
song, until it becomes clear the song won't let go of him.
</P>
<P>
   From out of the conflict between utopia and anarchy has emerged
moral ambiguity and complexity. In 1970, when he wrote ``Ohio''
following the murder of four students by National Guardsmen at Kent
State University, his rage was more instinctive than political:
``My lyrics get personal about it,'' he acknowledges. ``I'm
singing: 'What if you knew her and saw her dead on the ground? How
could you run when you know?''' But that anger was also answered a
few years later by ``Campaigner,'' when alone among major spokesmen
for the counterculture he expressed compassion for a disgraced
president who lost everything (``Even Richard Nixon has got
soul''); and conspicuously over the years he has refused to adopt
any ideological line. At one time or another he has supported
Ronald Reagan and Jesse Jackson. His ideal ticket in 2000 is
Gore-McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The utopia of his early music succumbed to anarchy most
spectacularly during an unhinged 1973 tour that was his rude answer
to superstardom. The shows would routinely climax with Young
screaming, ``Wake up!'' at his audiences as the '60s crashed down
around him in a rain of dead junkies; now, at the back of the
Pocahontas, all he can manage to say of the period is, ``I'm glad I
made it through it,'' before a pall settles over the interview.
Whenever Young ``tried to get away from success,'' his manager,
Elliot Roberts, remarks of the period, ``it just turned into a
bigger success,'' which wasn't just confusing but mortifying, since
success wasn't particularly subtle about its human toll. Young went
on to chronicle the deaths of the people around him in a series of
anti-drug songs _ ``The Needle and the Damage Done,'' ``Tired
Eyes,'' ``Tonight's the Night'' _ that were all the more
authoritative for the way they were reportorial rather than
judgmental, never denying for a moment the attraction of excess and
darkness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't like people telling me what to do,'' he explains
almost offhandedly. ``I didn't like people telling me if I made
more records like 'Harvest,' I would be successful. That's when I
came up with the concept of destroying what I created in order to
move on. I wanted to do what I called audio verite.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses and looks out the window. ``At a certain point,
trained, accomplished musicians'' _ which is to say, not him _
``hit the wall. They don't go there very often, they don't have the
tools to go through the wall, because it's the end of notes. It's
the other side, where there's only tone, sound, ambience,
landscape, earthquakes, pictures, fireworks, the sky opening,
buildings falling, subways collapsing. ... I don't know too many
musicians who try to go through the wall.'' He stops for a moment.
``I love to go through the wall,'' as if you ever doubted it for a
moment.
</P>
<P>
   In the collective memory of his longtime audience, he may
forever be the brooding figure reclining alone in the shadowy
gatefold of ``After the Gold Rush.'' But in fact virtually everyone
who has ever known him attests to his humor _ sometimes zany,
sometimes wry, mischievous. Over six feet tall, he has an easy yet
determined stride that encompasses all his contradictions: zen yet
a little obsessive, open yet a little unapproachable, lurching
toward his ambitions yet held back by his wariness of having to
explain himself.
</P>
<P>
   During a disgruntled taping with Crosby, Stills and Nash of
``Storytellers,'' the VH-1 series in which songwriters relate the
stories behind their songs, he paces the small stage like a caged
animal and cracks, ``I thought the song was supposed to tell the
story.'' And when I bump into him in a hotel lobby one afternoon
after failing to pin him down for an interview, and he assures me,
``I'm really not avoiding you, I'm just waiting until I feel more
alert,'' personally I feel quite certain he's avoiding me. But I'm
in the curious position of respecting him all the more for it.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, Elliot Roberts was just a 22-year-old from the Bronx
managing Buffalo Springfield when Young abruptly stopped a
rehearsal one afternoon to demand Roberts be fired on the spot. ``I
was shocked,'' Roberts recalls. ``It blew my mind.'' For days he
wandered L.A. stunned, trying to figure out what hit him, only for
Young to appear suddenly one night at 2 a.m. to explain he was
leaving the band and wanted Roberts to manage him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, he had plotted it all out,'' Roberts now laughs. ``I
thought, Wow, cool _ this guy is as devious as I am.'' To those who
have watched him over the years, Young comes off as a mastermind of
unpredictability. But sometimes he can appear less integrated and
more genuinely divided against himself than people think. The
utopian-anarchic ``schizophrenia'' (Young's word) of his music
reveals both a Spontaneous Neil and a Control-Freak Neil, each real
and each peering over the other's shoulder, each trying to correct
the other's misjudgments, each averting the other from perceived
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   There is no better example of this than the recent misadventures
of Young's authorized biographer. After signing a contract with
both Young and Random House, Jimmy McDonough, a journalist, spent
eight years writing, researching and interviewing more than 300
people, all with Young's cooperation. But when McDonough delivered
a manuscript at the end of 1998, Young suddenly _ according to the
publisher _ ``sabotaged'' the book by withholding his approval of
it, and Random House dropped the biography. In the Young camp,
nobody will comment for the record about why he killed the project.
But the unofficially stated reason _ that McDonough submitted the
book to Random House before submitting it to Young and thereby
breached the contract, betraying Young's trust _ sounds flimsy.
McDonough is now suing him for $1.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The melodrama of Neil Young's early life reached critical mass
in November 1978 with the birth of his second son _ by his wife,
Pegi _ and the subsequent realization that, like Young's first son,
Zeke, by the actress Carrie Snodgrass, Ben had cerebral palsy.
Zeke's case is mild (he is 27 and works as a sound engineer on a
number of his father's projects), but Ben is a quadriplegic. Young
would later recount walking out of the hospital and ``looking at
the sky, looking for a sign, wondering: What did I do? There must
be something wrong with me.''
</P>
<P>
   But cerebral palsy is a twist of fate, not of genetics _ Young's
daughter, Amber, doesn't have the disease. If all this weren't
overwhelming enough, not long after Ben's birth, Pegi was found to
have a brain tumor, from which, at the time, she had only a 50-50
chance of recovering. So in the early '80s, the man whose obsession
with his music was supposedly all-consuming set the music aside to
devote himself to his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of thoughts in my mind at that time,'' he
says now, ``that I wasn't ready to share with the world,'' and the
matter of Ben's health was so personal that in 1982, when Young
released a strange album called ``Trans'' with electronically
distorted vocals, few knew it grew out of an effort to communicate
with his speechless son by computer. During the rest of the decade,
Young's music seemed at loose ends on a series of recordings that
in hindsight appear redeemed as stylistic explorations of an
artistic identity in turmoil _ out of which ultimately emerged one
of his best albums, ``Freedom,'' in 1989. He then spent the '90s
making one important record after another.
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon in Philadelphia, when we had once again scheduled
an interview and he had once again vanished, I found out he had
gone to a school for children with cerebral palsy. Along with Pegi,
Young is a major supporter of such a school in California, and
during tours he often arranges for young people with the disease to
see the shows. I was annoyed that I hadn't been with him to get the
scene at the school for the story; in true Neil Young fashion, it
even happened during a full moon, when an elevator at the school
suddenly malfunctioned and the singer hovered for several
precarious minutes between floors. But then it occurred to me that
99 out of 100 rock stars would have jumped at the chance to drag me
along and put their humanitarianism on display, and that like so
much else with Young, maybe this was private, too.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes, you know, he just wings it. Sometimes it's not a
matter of a personal code (which he obviously has), or a
Machiavellian ploy (of which he's clearly capable); it's a matter
of impulse. Standing in the middle of a shopping-center parking lot
on the highway to Cleveland, waiting for the bus to refuel, Young
is talking about spending some time with his family after the tour
on the volcanic Big Island of Hawaii, when a young woman pulls up
in a pickup truck. She leans over and rolls down the window on the
passenger side, and on her face is the disbelief of her own eyes.
``Are you who I think you are?'' she asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who do you think I am?'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you Neil Young?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' he finally answers.
</P>
<P>
   Suspended between astonishment and opportunity, she sputters,
``Would you sign your name for me?''
</P>
<P>
   She scrambles to find something for him to write on. I'm
remembering the autograph hound outside the hotel in Philadelphia.
Now this woman in a pickup truck on her way to get her kid from
school maybe, or coming home from a job waiting on tables, in the
middle of a Wal-Mart parking lot that everybody knows is nowhere,
happens to peer through her windshield to see, standing over on a
small square of grass waiting for his dog to relieve himself, the
full-moon genius of rock 'n' roll. And then she makes two
decisions: the first, to have faith in what her eyes tell her; and
the second, to confront it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' he says. He steps up to the truck, leans in and
scrawls his name on whatever she has offered him, a gut reaction to
the purity of her wonder; and then as she drives away, with a story
she'll tell for the next 50 years, he goes back to contemplating
volcanoes and the sea, and the tropical winds where utopia and
anarchy converge.
</P>
<P>
   As he now seems eternally young, in earlier days Young was old
before his time. ``I'm getting old,'' he sang in his most famous
song, ``Heart of Gold,'' written when he was 24. In Phoenix, after
another show, as the others in the band celebrate with friends
backstage, Young sits alone in a dark, hushed room with a few
candles burning low nearby, nursing his back with an ice pack; he
seems every one of his 54 years. Earlier onstage he lost himself in
a deranged ``Down by the River'' as he had with ``Rockin' in the
Free World'' in Philadelphia, the Man That Time Forgot shredding
time to ribbons. But back here in the dark he's the Man That Time
Remembers, and it's remembering him in his lower back.
</P>
<P>
   So for a while we make small talk that he probably finds more
awkward than his graciousness allows him to admit. And then I
finally leave, after he has just ``slammed '' one more time through
the wall of age, the wall of fear, the wall of passion, to the end
of the night. As if you ever doubted it for a moment, he loves to
go through the wall, beyond the end of notes.

NEW DRUG TREATS AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By CAROLYN POIROT 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Margaret Lewis, 78, went into her bathroom
one morning, stared at her face in the mirror, then shut her left
eye. No one stared back. She was terrified.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't see my face, and that scared the devil out of me,''
Lewis said. ``I have grandchildren, and I love pretty things, and I
just can't ever lose my vision. I'd rather lose anything except my
eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Pauline Bailey, 84, of Burleson, Texas, Lewis, who lives in
Fort Worth, drives a car, watches television, reads the paper and
says she does everything for herself.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey said her vision is the key to her existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live alone and drive myself wherever I need to go. My vision
is everything to me. I can't imagine not having it,'' Bailey said.
Two years ago she began using drops for glaucoma, but there was
nothing she could do then for the bleeding behind her left retina.
</P>
<P>
   Both women recently participated in a study of light-activated
Visudyne, the first-ever drug treatment to slow vision loss from
the most aggressive form of age-related macular degeneration.
</P>
<P>
   Age-related macular degeneration is the leading cause of
blindness in Americans over 60, affecting an estimated 200,000
people each year. A disorder of the macula, an area of tissue near
the center of the retina, age-related macular degeneration affects
the center of the field of vision, making objects appear dark or
out of focus.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, a laser treatment has been available for a limited
number of patients whose macular degeneration has not progressed
very far, but it carries a strong risk of burning away the center
of the retina entirely.
</P>
<P>
   The new photodynamic therapy involves injecting the drug,
Visudyne, into the patient's arm by IV, waiting a few minutes for
the drug to reach the blood vessels of the eye, and then shining a
low-power laser light into the patient's eye for 83 seconds to
destroy the abnormal vessels and scar tissue without damaging the
retina, said Dr. Gary Cowan, an ophthalmologist with Retina
Consultants of Fort Worth, who directed the study here.
</P>
<P>
   The cool, red-light laser activates the drug.
</P>
<P>
   The new treatment is now FDA approved for what's known as the
wet form of macular degeneration, which occurs when tiny blood
vessels break through a membrane behind the retina and leak blood
and fluid, causing increasing loss of central vision. There is
still no treatment for the dry form, which is caused by scar tissue
building up over the center of the retina.
</P>
<P>
   Age-related macular degeneration ``robs people of the central
vision needed to read, drive and recognize faces,'' Cowan said.
``If you can't stop it, most will lose reading vision in one or
both eyes, and will be unable to drive. You can find the doorway
and avoid furniture _ you can do a lot with peripheral vision _ but
(macular degeneration) is a serious blow to independence. You need
to be able to pull a can from the cupboard and know whether it's
beets or corn without opening it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of patients in pretty good health develop this.
They may have to go to an assisted-living facility because they
can't prepare their own meals, and they were very independent
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Approval of the new drug was based on a major study involving 22
medical centers, including the University of Texas Southwestern
Medical Center at Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The new therapy is not a cure, FDA officials caution. While it
can slow retinal damage, it cannot stop vision loss or restore
vision in eyes damaged by age-related macular degeneration, but
patients who take the drug are more likely to have stable vision
after a year than those who do not receive the drug.
</P>
<P>
   The therapy costs about $2,000 per treatment, according to a
spokeswoman for one of its developers, CIBA Vision, a unit of
Novartis AG. The cost is covered by Medicare. Patients in the
studies cited by the FDA received three or four treatments during
the first year. Other studies cited by CIBA Vision suggest that
patients may need only two treatments per year thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any better, but it's not any worse, and I hope
with this treatment it won't get any worse,'' said Bailey, who has
worn glasses for about 60 years. She began developing glaucoma and
macular degeneration two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said she was a little afraid of the treatment but that it
was completely painless, and she believes her vision is a little
better in the affected eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, with my good eye, I can still get on the computer, and I
read and see movies,'' Lewis said. ``If it just stays like it is
right now, I'll be satisfied the rest of my life. The main thing is
that it not progress anymore. If it starts leaking again or the
other eye starts, I'm ready to have the Visudyne again.''

VANDERBILT HOUSE MIRRORS LUXURY OF A BYGONE ERA
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By BILL TEETER 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASHEVILLE, N.C. _ From any high point around Asheville, rugged
hills dominate the landscape for as far as the eye can see.
</P>
<P>
   Especially during the summer, when a thick growth of foliage
adds to the vistas, it's easy to see why George Washington
Vanderbilt III decided 112 years ago that here, on a high Blue
Ridge slope, he would build a home. When completed in 1895,
Biltmore Estate and its centerpiece mansion stood ready to
challenge the grandeur of any other elite property, either in
America or overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The estate, located about 115 miles west of Charlotte, has long
been a stopping place for literary and artistic figures and world
leaders. Writer Edith Wharton, President William McKinley and Fort
Worth's Van Cliburn have visited the estate during its 105-year
history.
</P>
<P>
   But millions of tourists have also traipsed through the Biltmore
since it opened for tours 70 years ago, giving them a glimpse into
a world where a select few resided in opulence unimaginable even to
today's leading CEOs.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt, grandson of the railroad and steamship magnate
Cornelius Vanderbilt, in 1889 began construction of an estate that
would include a mansion that is the largest privately-owned home in
the nation, a winery, a botanical conservatory, and woodland and
agricultural land. The 250-room Biltmore house served as home to
Vanderbilt, his wife, Edith, and daughter Cornelia for much of the
year. After Vanderbilt died in 1914, the estate landed in the hands
of Cornelia Vanderbilt and her husband, John Cecil..
</P>
<P>
   In 1930, at the request of Asheville officials, Cornelia
Vanderbilt and Cecil opened the house for tours in hopes of helping
the area's economy as the nation wallowed in the first months of
the Great Depression, said Biltmore spokeswoman Sarah Thomas. The
estate has been accessible to the public ever since, except during
World War II, when Washington's National Gallery of Art sent many
of the nation's art treasures to Biltmore House for safekeeping
during the war.
</P>
<P>
   The estate attracts about 900,000 visitors a year, drawn by the
home's history, art, architecture and botanical treasures, though
most visitors are attracted first by the idea of a European-style
chateau in a rural setting in the United States, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In New York City, it would be impressive, but perched on the
side of the hill in the tradition of the great homes of Europe, it
is amazing,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Upon approach, the French Renaissance-style mansion reveals
design elements from European chateaus. A stone, spiral stair tower
by the main front doors is a detail drawn from the Chateau de Blois
in France's Loire Valley. Designers who worked on the estate
include architect Richard Morris Hunt, known as the creative mind
behind the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty and the main facade of
the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Frederick Law Olmstead,
who designed New York's Central Park, was the landscape designer.
</P>
<P>
   The chateau's interior features Renaissance-era tapestries,
Oriental rugs and furniture that was antique even as the house was
completed 105 years ago. Other items are original paintings by
Renoir, such as ``Child With an Orange,'' a game table that was
once the property of Napoleon Bonaparte and a piano played by
Cliburn during his visit to the estate in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is original. There is so much more in storage that
we don't know what to do with. There are 250 rooms in the house,
but only 90 of them are open,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   The Biltmore is one of a number of U.S. estates that welcome
paying guests. Several large properties can be seen in Newport,
R.I., and California's somewhat smaller Hearst Castle in San Simeon
draws about 820,000 visitors annually, said Dan Eller, spokesman
for the Hearst Castle.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are American kings and queens, if you look at the
fortunes. The fortunes that these people had and the money they had
to spend are way out of the context of most Americans' lives. There
was no income tax. You made your money and you spent your money as
you wished,'' Eller said. ``Nobody can live like this today.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hearst Castle's somewhat smaller main residence is actually
broken into five buildings, Eller said. The Biltmore is a private
holding, with Cecil's son, William A.V. Cecil, serving as chief
executive officer of The Biltmore Co., a private, for-profit
company that operates the estate. The Hearst Castle estate is owned
by the California state parks system, Eller said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Biltmore Estate, the house is what catches the tourist's
eye, but other aspects of the estate are much more important, said
professor of architecture Jay C. Henry of the University of Texas
at Arlington. When work on the estate started, the land had been
denuded by overcutting and poor management by previous owners.
</P>
<P>
   Reforestation efforts under the direction of forester Gifford
Pinchot sparked a movement in landscape conservation in the United
States, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The estate is more significant than just the house. It was a
badly eroded landscape, which was then restored,'' Henry said.
``And that helped begin the landscape conservation movement in this
country. In the long run, the restoration of the estate land is
more important than the house.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   GENERAL INFORMATION &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Getting there: Biltmore Estate is on U.S. 25 just north of Exit
50 or 50B off Interstate 40 in Asheville, N.C., 115 miles from
Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Admission: $32 for adults, $24 for youths 10 to 15. Children
younger than 10 are admitted free with a paying adult. Admission
also covers attendance at special events held periodically on the
estate, with the exception of the summer concert series.
</P>
<P>
   Getting around: Visitors should wear casual clothing, including
a comfortable pair of shoes. The mansion tours involved quite a bit
of walking, as do tours of the gardens or the winery. To take in
everything, visitors should be ready to spend most of the day.
</P>
<P>
   The Biltmore has its own gift shop, located in the estate
carriage house area, as well as a cafe, ice cream parlor and
restaurant.

SPEECH PROVIDES REASON TO VOTE FOR THE GOVERNOR
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: No. of days to election in last graf presumes Aug. 8
publication date.) 
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By BILL THOMPSON 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As he so often does, George W. Bush made liars of his critics
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   They had said that he wasn't ready for prime time, that he
lacked ``gravitas,'' that he didn't look or sound ``presidential.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrong on all counts.
</P>
<P>
   Bush delivered a spectacular speech as he accepted the
Republican nomination for president to close out the Grand Old
Party's national convention. But he delivered even more: He
delivered the goods, laying out his compassionate conservative
philosophy in exquisite detail and establishing beyond a doubt that
he is more than ready to serve as president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The pundits had said that Bush's most crucial objective was to
show the American people that he ``fit the chair,'' that he had the
right stuff for national and international leadership.
</P>
<P>
   And show them he did.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't have to take my word for it. If you think that I'm
a shameless Bush-booster who would say his speech was great even if
it was lousy, then consider the opinions of some card-carrying
members of the liberal media elite who surely wouldn't hesitate to
jump on Bush with both feet if he so much as missed a beat.
</P>
<P>
   Do you suppose these power hitters at the Cable News Network
would fluff up a Bush performance just to make him look good?
</P>
<P>
   Judy Woodruff: ``Quite a speech. Quite a speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Sesno: ``The speech was everything that was promised and
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Candy Crowley: ``This was supposed to be the speech of his life,
and he may well have done it.''
</P>
<P>
   And there was this comment by ABC pundit and former Bill Clinton
mouthpiece/strategist George Stephanopoulos: ``It was a pretty
magnificent speech.''
</P>
<P>
   No kidding. Stephanopoulos said that Bush's speech was ``pretty
magnificent.''
</P>
<P>
   That's pretty magnificent in its own right, if you ask me.
</P>
<P>
   OK, OK, I know what the Bush-bashers are thinking. Anybody can
assemble a team of geniuses to write a speech, then practice
reading it for weeks on end and shoot the lights out reading it in
front of an adoring crowd of political fanatics.
</P>
<P>
   Well, yeah. Clinton has been doing it for years.
</P>
<P>
   But this wasn't just a top-flight performance of a well-written
speech. The speech ``was'' George W. Bush. It gave voice to his
hopes and dreams for his nation and its people. It put into words
his most heartfelt convictions about the importance of character
and leadership.
</P>
<P>
   If you were wondering, ``Why should I vote for Bush?,'' his
speech answered the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will confront the hard issues,'' Bush pledged, ``threats to
our national security, threats to our health and retirement
security, before the challenges of our time become crises for our
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we will extend the promise of prosperity to every
forgotten corner of this country: to every man and woman, a chance
to succeed; to every child, a chance to learn; and to every family,
a chance to live with dignity and hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds good, you say? But words won't cut it, you say? It's
action you want?
</P>
<P>
   Never mind those critics who claimed that Bush offered no
specifics. He offered plenty of specifics.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor outlined specific ideas for dealing with
Social Security, Medicare, education, taxes and rebuilding the
military.
</P>
<P>
   True enough, the speech contained no interminable, Clinton-like
gift list of federal programs promising pie-in-the-sky solutions
for every imaginable human grievance or dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bush offered vision. He offered leadership.
</P>
<P>
   He offered to ``usher in an era of responsibility'' _ an era in
which all Americans do their part to guarantee that the greatest
nation on earth achieves its potential.
</P>
<P>
   And he offered to restore honor and dignity to America's damaged
presidency:
</P>
<P>
   ``After all of the shouting and all of the scandal, after all
the bitterness and broken faith, we can begin again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wait has been long, but it won't be long now.''
</P>
<P>
   No, it won't be long at all. The election is only 91 days away.

   TREATMENT: When Black Patients Get Slighted
</P>
<P>
   A new study offers still more evidence that when it comes to
health care, black and white patients do not always get equal
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Circulation, the American Heart Association journal, is
reporting on Tuesday that blacks who have had heart attacks are
less likely to receive proven treatments to prevent a recurrence,
even when they are as inexpensive as aspirin or beta-blockers.
</P>
<P>
   The study, conducted at the Georgetown University, also found
smaller gaps in the treatment of women versus men and low-income
people versus higher ones.
</P>
<P>
   Racial disparities in treatment have increasingly become an
issue in medicine.
</P>
<P>
   In this study, researchers evaluated what treatments patients
were given when they entered hospitals and when they left. They
looked at 169,079 Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized from 1994 to
1996.
</P>
<P>
   For patients who have just had heart attacks, so-called
clot-buster drugs and aspirin are known to improve the chances of
survival. After discharge, aspirin and beta-blockers can prevent a
recurrence.
</P>
<P>
   The study found, for example, that in the hospital, about 63
percent of the white patients studied were given clot-busting
drugs, but only about 56 percent of the black ones were. When the
patients left, about 55 percent of the whites got prescriptions for
beta-blockers, while about 50 percent of the blacks did.
</P>
<P>
   While the researchers said they did not believe there was
conscious discrimination, they said more study was needed to
determine why the disparities occurred.
</P>
<P>
   AGING: A Warning Sign Often Overlooked
</P>
<P>
   Doctors routinely overlook a serious sign of osteoporosis, the
condition that leaves older people _ primarily women _ susceptible
to repeated, often immobilizing bone breaks, according to a study
being released today.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which looked at 1,162 postmenopausal women who had
broken one or both their wrists, found that only a quarter had been
evaluated or treated for the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The report was published The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery
and was prepared by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   A broken wrist, the researchers said, is often the first sign of
osteoporosis in women over 55, suggesting decreased bone mineral
density, thus making bones more fragile.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who breaks her wrist at this age may double her chance
of breaking a hip, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet after analyzing patient records and pharmacy claims in the
six months after the wrists were broken, the researchers found a
serious failure to diagnose and treat osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for the oldest patients, those most at risk, the level
of treatment was even lower.
</P>
<P>
   Only 9.1 percent of the women ages 85 to 89 in the study were
being treated for osteoporosis; 4.2 percent of those 90 to 94; and
4.7 percent of those over 95. This compares with a rate of 36
percent in the women ages 55 to 59.
</P>
<P>
   The author of the study, Dr. Kevin Freedman, said the findings
suggested that doctors needed to be diligent about making sure that
postmenopausal patients being treated for wrist breaks received
good follow-up evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in older patients,'' he said, ``treatment for
osteoporosis does work to maintain or increase bone density and
prevent fractures.''
</P>
<P>
   Osteoporosis is commonly treated with hormone replacement
therapy or drugs that restore the mineral levels in the bones.
</P>
<P>
   PATTERNS: New Clues for Treating a Child's Seizure
</P>
<P>
   When children have seizures, doctors are sometimes put in
quandaries: should they assume the seizure is epilepsy and begin
medicating? Or should they wait and hope it is just an isolated
occurrence?
</P>
<P>
   A new study may shed some light on the best course. In the
current Annals of Neurology, researchers say they have found that
when a child has seizures more than once, the diagnosis probably is
epilepsy.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy percent of children who have a second seizure go on to
have more. Knowing this may help doctors decide whether long-term
medication, despite the potential for side effects, may be
appropriate, the study said. The report was prepared by researchers
from the Montefiore Medical Center and the Albert Einstein College
of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Previous studies, the researchers said, have shown that a single
seizure _ or a set of them over 24 hours _ does not necessarily
mean a child has epilepsy. About a third go on to have second
seizures, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   The new findings were based on a study of 407 children under 16
after their first seizures.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that the children at the highest risk for
continued seizures were those whose first two convulsions occurred
within six months of each other. Also at risk where those with
neurological conditions like cerebral palsy.
</P>
<P>
   SYMPTOMS: Headaches, With and Without the Pain
</P>
<P>
   A headache without the head pain might sound contradictory, but
the condition, described in a new journal article, could lend
insights into an ailment known as the cluster headache.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors writing in the August 7 issue of Neurology described the
case of a 22-year-old man who had all the symptoms of a cluster
headache, except the pain.
</P>
<P>
   When he went to his doctor, he exhibited nasal stuffiness, a
droopy eyelid and contraction of one of his pupils, all signs of
the painful condition that affects about 1 in 1,000 people, mostly
men.
</P>
<P>
   The patient said he suffered one to three attacks a day, each
lasting an hour or two. After six weeks, the symptoms disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   But six years later, the article said, the man came back.
</P>
<P>
   This time, he had the same symptoms, but also severe pain that
lasted 90 minutes, about twice a day.
</P>
<P>
   When he was treated with a drug used for cluster headaches,
sumatriptan, the pain and most of his other symptoms went away.
</P>
<P>
   ``This report may guide future cluster headache research in
another direction,'' the author, Dr. Rolf Salvesen of the
University of Tromso in Norway, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   His patient's condition offers evidence that tearing, congestion
and drooping eye associated with cluster headaches are not, as many
believed, a response to the pain, but symptoms in their own right.
</P>
<P>
   TESTING: In Search of the Deep Breath Chemical
</P>
<P>
   The biochemistry of breathing deeply, the one thing an asthmatic
cannot do in the midst of the attack, may hold a key to helping
doctors treat people who have asthma.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study suggests that the mere act of breathing deeply
may stretch lung tissue and cause the release of a protective
chemical that keeps the airways open. Writing in the Journal of
Applied Physiology, researchers from Johns Hopkins University said
that if the chemical could be identified, it could possibly be the
basis of an asthma drug.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers came to the conclusion after studies involving
the drug methacholine, which narrows airways and causes wheezing in
people with asthma. In healthy people, the drug has no effect,
unless they take a series of shallow breaths before taking it,
early studies show.
</P>
<P>
   This time, asthmatic and healthy volunteers were asked to
breathe deeply before being given the drug. While the deep breaths
did not help the people with asthma, they did reduce the adverse
effects of the drug by 85 percent in healthy people, the study
said.

   Red Hot Chili Peppers
</P>
<P>
   Q. How is the heat of hot peppers measured?
</P>
<P>
   A. The best-known method relies on the amount of a pepper
extract mixed with water that a panel of tasters need to sense the
heat. Invented in 1912 by Wilbur Scoville, a pharmacologist, the
rating is given in Scoville units.
</P>
<P>
   The sample is dried and mixed with alcohol; then sugar water is
added. The tasters are given shot glasses holding increasingly
higher dilutions of the concoction and are asked to determine the
dilution at which the pepper no longer burns the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   A mild salsa might rate a puny 400 units on the scale; a
jalapeno pepper might be 1,500 to 4,500, while a much hotter
habanero pepper could hit 150,000.
</P>
<P>
   The method relies on the subjective human palate, and scientists
have increasingly turned instead to measuring the amount of
capsaicin in the pepper. Capsaicin, a substance that gives the
sensation of heat when it hits nerve receptors, is analyzed in
terms of parts per million using computerized devices.
</P>
<P>
   Substances other than capsaicin may be involved in heating up
the mouth, and both ratings can vary widely from crop to crop and
even from sample to sample from the same crop.
</P>
<P>
   If eating a highly rated pepper causes distress, drink milk or
eat yogurt; casein will help neutralize the capsaicin, while water
usually does not provide relief.
</P>

   LIEBERMAN-GORE (Washington) _ In tapping Joseph Lieberman, the
first orthodox Jewish member of the U.S. Senate, as the nation's
first Jewish vice presidential nominee, Al Gore raises many
questions. We look at whether an overwhelmingly Christian
electorate will vote for a non-Christian, whether Lieberman will
help Hillary Rodham Clinton in New York and whether his strong
criticisms of President Clinton in the Monica Lewinsky scandal will
help Gore. By MARK HELM and JUDY HOLLAND.
</P>
<P>
   LIEBERMAN-RECORD (Washington) _ A look at Sen. Joseph
Lieberman's voting and political history, including areas where he
is at odds with Vice President Al Gore. By JULIE MASON.
</P>
<P>
   LIEBERMAN-CLINTON (Washington) _ Joseph Lieberman was the first
Democratic senator to scold President Clinton for the Monica
Lewinsky scandal, calling for his censure rather than impeachment.
In his Senate floor speech 19 months ago, Lieberman said of
Clinton's sexual affair with the former White House intern, ``Such
behavior is not just inappropriate, it is immoral and it is
harmful.'' By MICHAEL HEDGES.
</P>
<P>
   REFORM-PARTY (Washington) _ A long-simmering battle for control
of the Reform Party moves to the front burner over the next several
days when the party meets in Long Beach, Calif., to nominate a
candidate for president. The winner will control the party and the
$12.6 million in federal money that will become available to its
presidential nominee. By LETITIA STEIN.

<P>
   MEANS-COLUMN (Washington) _ By choosing to run for the White
House with Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, Vice President Al
Gore came about as close as he decently could to poking President
Clinton in the eye. Lieberman, a senior Democratic legislator of
impeccable personal integrity, was the party's most thoughtful _
and most devastating _ critic of Clinton's moral lapse during his
affair with Monica Lewinsky. By MARIANNE MEANS.
</P>
<P>
   THOMPSON-COLUMN (Washington) _ When the Democrats nominate
Connecticut Sen. Joseph Lieberman for vice president next week, he

A SURFEIT OF SPADE SINKS `SAMMY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
SAMMY 
Starring the voices of: David Spade, Andy Dick, Maura Tierney, Bob
Odenkirk, Jeffrey Tambor 
On: NBC 
Time: Tuesday at 8:30 
Rated: TVPG 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How much David Spade is too much David Spade? Your answer to
that question may determine how you'll receive NBC's ``Sammy,'' the
latest of many animated series trying for prime-time popularity.
The sarcasm-laced comedy is produced by Spade, stars the voice of
Spade in two lead roles, and is a parody of the real-life
relationship between Spade and his father, Wayne Spade.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it's an awfully tall glass of Spade, with no
bubbles and not a hint of sugar.
</P>
<P>
   And it's a little too much Spade for this viewer. The makers of
``Just Shoot Me,'' Spade's other NBC sitcom, got it right from the
start, portioning out the famously snide comic's gags in small
doses. Seemingly aware that Spade's adolescent ridiculing can
quickly turn bitter and grating, they've kept him as a supporting
player and softened his arrogance with geekiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sammy,'' on the other hand, finds Spade's angry, wounded
adolescence trapped in a hall of mirrors. The show revolves around
Spade stand-in James Blake, an ironic sitcom star voiced by Spade.
In each episode, he is victimized by his freeloading dad, Sammy, an
absentee father who appears out of the blue once his son has become
rich and famous. Sammy is a bad joke of a man, a shameless
womanizer who sneaks around his son's mansion with young actresses
and uses over-the-top come-on lines like ``Just quit the grinnin'
and drop the linen, we're going to do some sinnin'.'' In case we
aren't sufficiently annoyed by Sammy, Spade provides him with a
shrill, fingers-on-chalkboard voice.

   The supporting voices are easier to take, particularly Andy Dick
as James's agent and Maura Tierney as his assistant. And Julia
Sweeney puts in a warm guest appearance in the premiere as his
protective mother. She comes to Hollywood to save James from his
sleazy father, and, predictably, she becomes ensnared by his
low-rent charms. Quickly, though, she sees through his games and
wises up.
</P>
<P>
   After a half-hour of Sammy's tiresome pranks, you might find
yourself wanting to follow her out of his clutches once and for
all.

<P>
   Al Gore is an intellectual. In case we doubted his credentials,
a recent New Yorker profile of the vice president made this clear.
Gore referred to ``the Cartesian revolution,'' Reinhold Neibuhr's
work and Thomas Kuhn's theory of paradigms. Wonky to the point of
weirdness, Gore loves nothing more than a dorm-room bull session.
To Nicholas Lemann, The New Yorker writer, he held forth with
uncanny fluency on ``the origins of our modern world view, and its
curious reliance on specialization and ever-narrower slices of the
world around us into categories.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so the man's a pedant. Faced with the threat of another
bibliophobic President Bush, what card-carrying intellectual
wouldn't embrace the prospect of a president who casually invokes
Niebuhr and Descartes? Gore's bookish bent is tonic; his habit of
convening academics and policy types to conduct informal seminars
at the vice presidential mansion conjures up memories of the
Kennedy era, when, as the late Alfred Kazin grandly put it,
``Intellect was in touch with power.''
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, do Gore's showy displays of erudition provoke in me a
tremor of alarm? Is it because of their provenance? Earlier this
year, Michael Wolff, a media critic for New York magazine, dated
the formation of Gore's intellectual template back to the '50s and
'60s when ``Ivy League classiness'' flourished.
</P>
<P>
   I think a more precise date is 1966 to 1970, Gore's Harvard
years. The books that Gore has cited as his intellectual
touchstones _ Kuhn's ``The Structure of Scientific Revolutions,''
Maurice Merleau-Ponty's ``The Phenomenology of Perception,'' the
work of Edmund Husserl _ adorned every bookshelf on campus, along
with Emile Durkheim's ``Suicide,'' David Reisman's ``The Lonely
Crowd,'' and Erik Erikson's ``Childhood and Society.'' The trouble
with Gore's perpetual theorizing is that it's straight out of the
'60s.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, Gore presents himself as a precise and systematic
thinker. He diagrams his points, dilates on English constitutional
history, produces complex metaphors like ``the clockwork universe''
and the world as ``a machine of moving parts.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet a close scrutiny of his ideas reveals a mind in love with
the existential and the Dionysian. One of his new favorites is
``The Marriage of Sense and Soul,'' by Ken Wilber, a disciple of
Deepak Chopra who makes the familiar case that modern civilization
has emphasized material things at the expense of the emotional and
spiritual needs _ shades of Norman O. Brown, the intellectual guru
of my '60s generation.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's masterwork, ``Love's Body,'' was a touchy-feely tract
disguised as philosophy. When Gore writes, in his 1992 book,
``Earth in the Balance,'' about the ``psychic pain at the very root
of the modern mind,'' and ``the experience of living in one's body
as a fully integrated physical and mental being,'' one is tempted
to respond with a rousing, ``Dig it!''
</P>
<P>
   Is this a problem? Should we expect our presidential candidates
to be au courant with the latest intellectual touchstones? Why
doesn't Gore demonstrate familiarity with deconstruction, with the
work of Jacques Derrida or the critical legal studies pioneered by
Stanley Fish?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Gore does have ideas. It's exhilarating to hear him
attacking government bureaucracy or applying business-management
theory to the original principles of freedom espoused by the
framers of the Constitution. In his book, he trenchantly argues
that the looming environmental crisis is a moral crisis. But he
needs to state these ideas plainly and forcefully, not dressed up
in the intellectual platitudes of broken-spined paperbacks exhumed
from his college days.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe in order for intellect to be in touch with power again,
power should keep its distance from intellect.

   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ A lot of people have made fun of the charade
of inclusiveness last week at the Republican Convention, as one
black or Hispanic speaker after another trooped to the podium. But
George W. Bush is likely to benefit from the rainbow parade for a
simple reason. The Democrats have made their own mockery of
inclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the GOP platform calls for cultural and ethnic policies
favored by the party's fringes, belying Bush's eloquent pleas for
racial equality, Al Gore has succumbed to the left wing of his
party on issues of race. Both candidates, knowing that most
Americans now genuinely favor inclusiveness, have spun cobwebs of
centrist deceit, projecting images of moderation that bear no
relation to the underlying intolerance among hard-liners of their
respective parties.
</P>
<P>
   From Bush's convention speech, you'd never know his
administration in Texas has imprisoned and executed more
African-Americans than any predecessor; that he scuttled a bill to
provide health insurance for poor children; and that he is
generally hostile to legislation aimed at reducing racial
profiling, restraining police brutality or getting the guns that
disproportionately kill young blacks and Latinos off the streets.
</P>
<P>
   No Republican strategist was so naive as to believe minority
voters would be taken in by the show in Philadelphia or by the
campaign's photo ops at ghetto schools. But the smart-money
punditry that this was all aimed at moderate Republicans and
independents makes even less sense; they are the nation's most
politically savvy and educated voters and can see through the
illusion of an aristocratic walk through the barrios.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the strategy is working. Bush leads in all national polls.
Why? Perhaps because the swing voters sense that Gore is playing a
similar game on the left. The Democrats are certainly more
inclusive demographically and favor policies that more directly
meet the immediate needs of underprivileged minorities. What is
disturbing about Gore's campaign is that he has yielded to the
established minority leadership (like the Congressional Black
Caucus and some minority mayors), which is now committed to a
conception of inclusiveness that eschews genuine social and
cultural integration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ethnic diversity'' and ``cultural pluralism'' are the buzz
words of deception on this side of the spectrum. Certainly on
college campuses, diversity no longer means genuine cultural
exchange, but the promotion of differences; in politics, the
protection of ethnic turfs is at stake. While most
African-Americans and the middle classes generally still say they
favor integration, some prominent black political leaders have
given up on this strategy. The NAACP even had an internal debate
over continued support for the ideal of integration.
</P>
<P>
   I consider this development a disaster, for the simple
sociological truth is that the main source of the problems among
black Americans is their isolation from the overarching capitalist
culture that their leaders misleadingly identify with white
society.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and the Democrats have rightly criticized the growing use
of the death penalty and incarceration, and lamented internal
problems of the African-American population, like collapsing
families and the education gap. But they dare not suggest specific
bold solutions for fear of alienating core constituencies: they shy
away from ideas to deal with the persistent failure of black
students, for example, to avoid offending teachers' unions, and
they yield to urban leaders opposed to plans aimed at moving
inner-city dwellers to areas that offer better job and educational
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Instead we find Gore playing the identity game to the hilt, one
day holding court with Al Sharpton, the next pandering to the
fanatical Cuban-American leadership over Elian Gonzalez. Nor did it
matter that Cuban-Americans and African-Americans often have
strongly opposed interests. Give the demagogues what they want and
let them take care of their own.
</P>
<P>
   What both the Republican and Democratic fringes fail to see or
acknowledge is a vigorous ecumenical change sweeping the nation. It
bears no affinity to any party or ethnic group. Its most remarkable
feature is its market-driven inclusiveness. America continues to
absorb vast numbers of newcomers from everywhere, and, contrary to
what multiculturalists imagine, they stay for the sheer liberation
of living where they can get any job if they have the skills, can
marry across any ethnic or cultural boundary and can live pretty
nearly anywhere they want if they can afford to.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans have come to accept this genuinely inclusive
ecumenical center, even if there are howls of pain and resentment
as vested interests and cherished particularisms, left and right,
fall by the wayside. That most people reject Buchananite calls for
jingoistic exclusion is the best indication of the maturity of the
electorate. This is America's real vital center, and it is
precisely what the political parties overlook, even as they issue
vague pieties about inclusiveness and moving to the center.
</P>
<P>
   It may be that the genuinely centrist and independent voters
consider Bush's contradictions more palatable, not because they are
racists, but because they believe that the long-term consequences
for African-Americans, and for a truly integrated America, are not
as devastating in Bush's camp as in the alternative.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For anyone who has been involved in the Middle East
peace process, it is obvious how difficult are the issues of
permanent territorial boundaries, the return of Palestinians to
their former homeland and the status of Jerusalem. In addition,
crucial questions will have to be answered involving the Golan
Heights, water rights, freedom of movement, Israeli settlements in
the West Bank and Gaza, the characteristics of a Palestinian state
and the joint maintenance of security.
</P>
<P>
   I have found that there are often specific negotiating points on
which neither disputing side can possibly yield, and these have to
be finessed. In 1978 at Camp David, Anwar Sadat, Menachem Begin and
I addressed the status of Jerusalem in some of our early sessions,
and we agreed immediately that the issue of sovereignty was too
sensitive to confront. We knew that Israel had declared sovereignty
over the entire city but that the international community
considered East Jerusalem to be legally part of the occupied West
Bank. We realized that no Israeli leader could renounce Israel's
assertion, and that it would be politically suicidal for Sadat or
any other Arab leader to surrender any of their people's claims
regarding the Islamic and Christian holy places.
</P>
<P>
   Accepting these premises, we worked out a mutually agreeable
paragraph, acknowledging the city to be holy to Islam, Judaism and
Christianity; guaranteeing free access to all parts of it;
permitting the holy places to be under control of their own
religious representatives; and approving a municipal council with
balanced representation of the inhabitants to supervise all
community functions and to guarantee the integrity of the various
cultural and educational institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Although there were never any subsequent differences about the
wording, we decided at the last minute not to include the paragraph
in our final declaration, for fear that it might make the already
controversial text unacceptable to the Israeli Knesset.
</P>
<P>
   This is still the only basic approach that can succeed
concerning Jerusalem: to negotiate practical agreements on
unlimited access to and control of the holy places and a joint
administration of the city's more mundane affairs. It would be
impossible in the foreseeable future for either Yasser Arafat or
Ehud Barak to yield on any issue concerning legal sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   An important principle in negotiation is for the mediator to
maintain at least the semblance of neutrality. Accolades for one
side and condemnation of the other is always a political temptation
after an unsuccessful effort, but this makes it very difficult to
orchestrate future negotiation sessions where mutual confidence in
the mediator is required. Such statements made since the recent
Camp David discussions have aroused concern in the Arab community,
and the possible movement of the American embassy from Tel Aviv to
Jerusalem would create an even greater impediment to further
progress.
</P>
<P>
   My impression is that a strong majority of both Israelis and
Palestinians would welcome continuing attempts to achieve a
peaceful resolution of the remaining issues. The courageous and
determined efforts by President Clinton, Barak and Arafat have
brought encouraging progress, at least in frankly exploring
eventual solutions to the most important and contentious problems.
</P>
<P>
   If hope for a peaceful resolution of these issues is to be
preserved, it is crucial to remember that this is a long-term
process that is likely to engage the next generation of American,
Israeli and Palestinian leaders. No action should be taken by any
of the parties that will make future efforts even more difficult.

 By PAUL W. HOBBY    
 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Politically, Texas is caught in crossfire because our
governor, George W. Bush, is running for president. Every
shortcoming, real or imagined, has been cited by his detractors as
proof of government failure or a heartless culture. Despite Bush's
warning in his nomination speech on Thursday not to ``mess with
Texas,'' the broadsides will continue because of the way America
elects presidents. A majority of Texans will be voting for Bush,
and the Electoral College will issue no transferable credits to Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Even if I didn't understand the politics of it all, the Texan in
me cares very little about whether others approve of us. If to be
different is to be criticized, bring it on. My deepest concern is
that someday we won't be different, that creeping suburbanization
will dilute a spirit based on perseverance and personal integrity.
</P>
<P>
   I am no shill for the Bush campaign; Bush replaced me as
chairman of a state agency after his first election and openly
campaigned against me in 1998, when I ran for state comptroller and
was the state's leading Democratic vote-getter. But I appreciate
what is different about Texas, and it boils down to this: In our
view freedom is so intertwined with individual risk that the two
are almost indistinguishable at the core.
</P>
<P>
   In my experience, many other places don't admire risk-taking,
but only the successes it may bring. Here, we admire boldness and
optimism even in failure, because real freedom has to include the
freedom to fail.
</P>
<P>
   As a progressive, I think government can work, can inspire, and
should help those who are deserving; but as a Texan, I strongly
resent the presumption of a bureaucracy that meddles in everyone's
life instead of focusing on the few bad actors who live outside the
social contract.
</P>
<P>
   Rugged individualism hasn't always served us well. We have been
slow to embrace collective notions like environmental planning,
lackluster in our commitment to public education and uneven in our
efforts to heal racial discrimination. But our way is still closer
to the American ideal.
</P>
<P>
   As good an example as any is the story of my family's visits to
our nation's beaches. Massachusetts made us take a life preserver
off our son because the government had decided that devices to keep
children from sinking can lead to overconfidence. California said
we could not throw a Frisbee or roast marshmallows without
permission. Florida said we needed a permit for our dog before we
could throw a ball to him.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, all our beaches are the property of people to enjoy
with an absolute minimum of ``mother-may-I.'' We welcome all of
those from elsewhere, but they can't expect the authorities to
guard them against every ripple of risk and every chance that
someone might behave badly.
</P>
<P>
   This attitude goes well beyond beaches. By careful design, we
allow our Legislature to convene only for four and a half months
every other year because the tendency of collective bodies is to
create process. And each little piece of process is a razor cut
bleeding away individual freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has some internal issues to address, but we don't need a
more expansive view of government to be mainstream American.
Jefferson didn't write the Declaration of Independence, and
Washington didn't cross the Delaware, so we could create a
government to protect us from ourselves.

FROM A PEA-SIZED LUMP, YEARS OF UNCERTAINTY

Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell Center.

<TEXT>
<P>
   One evening last summer, Jonah M. came to see me at my clinic.
Because he had a walk-in appointment, I figured he had a minor
problem _ maybe a sore throat, a sprained ankle _ that I could help
him with right away. When he sat in my examination room, his face
was flushed. ``I have a lump on my testicle,'' he announced.
</P>
<P>
   He was 29, handsome, with unruly brown hair, hazel eyes and a
nervous earnestness that was instantly likable. He had a kind of
California surfer drawl that bespoke nonchalance, but his darting
glances and stammer betrayed his anxiety. The lump was about the
size of a pea, he said. It didn't hurt. He had noticed it only the
night before.
</P>
<P>
   I was immediately concerned. A painless testicular mass, if
indeed it arises from the testicle, is almost always cancer. (A
scrotal mass can turn out to be a varicocele, or benign dilated
veins.) Of course, testicular cancer isn't always a painless
testicular mass. Sometimes it is a painful lump or tender swelling.
Often it is confused with epididymitis, an inflammation of the
tubules that ferry sperm out of the testis, or orchitis, which is
the generalized inflammation of the testes, usually from an
infection.
</P>
<P>
   While talking with Jonah, I remembered another patient: His
disease had been misdiagnosed for months as epididymitis, before an
ultrasound found cancer. By then, it had spread to his brain and
lungs.
</P>
<P>
   For Jonah, an exam turned up nothing out of the ordinary other
than the lump, which was round, rubbery and about half an inch in
diameter. Though I had almost no experience with testicular cancer,
I knew this was serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you think?'' Jonah asked.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't sure what to say. ``I'm not sure,'' I replied. ``It may
be nothing. Let me consult with another doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   As a medical resident, I went to my supervisor. Concerned, she
came with me to examine it. Later, in her office, we discussed what
to do. ``It's probably cancer,'' she said.``He needs an ultrasound
to confirm it.'' Though excited by my discovery, I was saddened by
the burden I was about to lay on Jonah. ``Good pickup,'' she said,
aware of my feelings. ``You caught it early. He can probably be
cured.''
</P>
<P>
   When I got back to my exam room 15 minutes later, Jonah was even
more on edge. ``What do I have?'' he asked. I decided not to burden
him unnecessarily with unconfirmed suspicions. ``I don't know,'' I
replied. ``We need more information. Can you come in tomorrow for
an ultrasound?'' A wave of alarm washed over him. ``Do I have
cancer?'' he whispered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't know at this point,'' I said. ``We need more
information.''
</P>
<P>
   Testicular cancer is the most common solid tumor in men 15 to
34. The incidence has been rising worldwide, and in the United
States 7,000 to 8,000 cases are diagnosed every year. The cause is
unknown, though men with a history of viral infections or an
undescended testicle seem more at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Like most cancers, it used to be a death sentence; today, with
advances in chemotherapy, it has a cure rate of 90 percent. Even
patients whose cancer has metastasized can usually be cured. (Just
ask Lance Armstrong, the cyclist who won the Tour de France three
years after debilitating chemotherapy for metastatic testicular
cancer.) Still, it's a frightening diagnosis, not just because it's
cancer, but because the primary treatment is one of the scariest
things a man can envision: removal of a testicle.
</P>
<P>
   Jonah had his ultrasound the next morning. By 5, the urology
resident paged me. ``It's cancer,'' he said. The test showed a
round, well-defined mass, about five-eighths of an inch in
diameter, on top of the right testicle. ``Have you told him?'' I
asked. ``I'm about to,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   Jonah later told me how he got the bad news. ``The resident just
walked right in with his team and told me,'' he said. ``He was very
take-charge and matter of fact. His attitude was, ``This is what
you have, and this is what we need to do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But it was sort of like _ boom! _ I wasn't expecting it. The
scariest thing is how you can be just fine one minute, and the next
have someone tell you you have cancer and need to have your
testicle removed.''
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, Jonah had an orchiectomy, the removal of a
testicle. He was out of the hospital that day, and though morphine
and codeine relieved the pain, he said later that there was a far
more painful reality: ``That my body was not going to be the
same.''
</P>
<P>
   His biggest fear after surgery was sexual inadequacy. Because an
orchiectomy often results in a drop in serum testosterone, he was
warned that he might need hormone replacement. He never did, and
after a few weeks, with the occasional help of Viagra, he resumed
normal sexual relations with his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   After the operation, Jonah consulted a cancer specialist, who
told him that his kind of testicular cancer had about a 30 percent
chance of recurrence and he had two options: dissection of the
lymph nodes in his groin and abdomen for evidence of residual
disease, or ``watchful waiting,'' in which he would have blood
tests and X-rays every month, as well as CAT scans every three
months. He waited, and soon it will be a year since Jonah walked
into the clinic. So far, so good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, late at night, I lie awake thinking. Like, if I
don't move around, don't stir, it won't emerge again. Like if I
move around too much, I might awaken it. Like it's this beast,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   A beast, I agreed: asleep and scary, but one that can be killed.

&HT;     TRIAL BEGINS FOR ADMIRED DOORMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (ATTN: Houston, Minneapolis)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MICHAEL DOUGAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The day after Anton Segal got smacked hard on
the head by an angry man with a makeshift weapon, friends rushed to
his side.
</P>
<P>
   They came from as far as Hong Kong to stand by Segal, 28, while
he lay in San Francisco General Hospital, unable to recover from a
blow that cracked open his skull. On Nov. 24, 1998 _ three days
after the attack _ Segal died.
</P>
<P>
   The police quickly learned that Segal, a doorman at the Roaring
20's strip club in North Beach, did not fit the stereotype of a
hoochie-coochie barker. A Harvard graduate and published writer,
fluent in five languages, Segal was ``a really sharp guy,'' said
homicide Inspector John Hennessey. ``This was a tragic loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses had recorded the license plate number of the suspect's
brown van. Within days the police arrested Daniel Alas, 32, an
ex-convict from San Mateo working as a plumber at San Francisco
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Alas' murder trial is being held this week in San Francisco
Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   For Jim and YoYo Segal, Anton's parents from Houston, the
criminal proceedings mark the final chapter in a life that once
seemed pregnant with promise.
</P>
<P>
   Segal, a Texan of Japanese and Jewish ancestry, arrived in San
Francisco in April 1998 from Egypt. Before that, he had toured
Southeast Asia and lived in Japan. By the time he left Houston for
Harvard in 1987, he already had visited five continents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much more I want to see and do,'' Segal wrote in
his Harvard application essay. ``I want to learn how mountain
gorillas make love and war. I want to learn the clicking language
of the Bantu, to study Zorastrianism and Zen.''
</P>
<P>
   He also knew ``what I do not want to be. I do not want to be a
doctor, lawyer or industrial chief. I don't want a BMW and a
Manhattan townhouse. I prefer a camel and a yurt.''
</P>
<P>
   During Harvard registration, Segal loaned a pencil to a
``buttoned down, straight and narrow'' freshman from Minneapolis
named Stephen Yi. As they left the building, Yi recalled, they
encountered a political radical ``peddling extreme left-wing
literature. I, of course, thought this guy was a complete freak and
wanted to stay away from him. Anton just walked up and started
talking to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Yi, who earned a law degree from Harvard and now works for an
Internet company in Pasadena, Calif., said he and Segal became fast
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Segal also befriended dorm mates Stu Finkel and Elizabeth
``Betsy'' Flanagan. Each would play a role in his final hours.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating with a degree in anthropology, Segal ``went
abroad and began teaching in Japan and working with young high
school and junior high school students there,'' his father said.
``He was very much an adventurer.''
</P>
<P>
   It may have been genetic. Anton's dad, Jim Segal, had ``trekked
in Nepal, hitched through the Khyber Pass, worked in Japan, lived
with headhunters in Borneo,'' Anton proudly reported in his Harvard
application essay. In Japan, Jim Segal met and married a woman
named YoYo _ ``born Shintoist in wartime Tokyo, raised as a
Buddhist, educated in an Episcopalian school in Kyoto.''
</P>
<P>
   They settled in Houston when Anton was 10. They have two other
children: Laurie, 36, a psychotherapist in Long Island, N.Y., and
Erica, 28, a television producer in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Segals were supportive of Anton's adventurous lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``While other people were going for big bucks and big offices .
. . Anton really was interested in gathering stories of an
underclass,'' Jim Segal said. ``He lived on 30 cents a day. He
hitchhiked through China. He worked with many of the disadvantaged
people throughout the world.''
</P>
<P>
   After spending several years abroad, Segal moved to California,
where he reconnected with his old Harvard chums, Finkel and Yi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had asked him if he wanted to come live with me in San
Francisco for the summer, so he took me up on the offer,'' Yi said.
Both were surprised when Segal landed a job as doorman at the
Roaring 20's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that was sort of typical Anton, doing something wild
and crazy again, trying to experience something else that he could
write about,'' Yi said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He liked working there because it was something unusual and
different and exciting,'' said Finkel, who is working on his
doctorate in history at Stanford University. ``It was the closest
he could come back here to the different sorts of experiences he
had abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   Segal fit in well with the striptease crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was generous. He was a gentleman. He would never flirt with
the girls, but the girls would flirt with him because he was
trustworthy and he was kind,'' said Jaguar, 24, a dancer who goes
by her stage name. ``He knew all the homeless people on the street
pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   Segal had been on a fast track at the Roaring 20's. On the
evening of Nov. 21, he was going to manage the club by himself for
the first time, according to Jaguar.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he was scared,'' she recalled. ``He had fear in his
eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   A friend, Sam Archer, disagreed, noting the Segal _ while short
in stature _ was a prize-winning bodybuilder with a black belt in
tae kwan do.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could look after himself but he would do anything to avoid
a confrontation,'' he said. ``He was a very confident man.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that night a man the police identified as Alas approached
the Roaring 20's entrance, where Segal barred his way because he
was carrying an open beer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm told by one of the witnesses that when Anton turned Alas
away from the bar . . . he put his arm around the guy and said,
'Hey buddy, don't worry. Finish your beer and come on back and you
can get into the club,''' Jim Segal said.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said Alas returned later that evening and struck Segal
on the head with a piece of car security equipment known as The
Club. Segal crumbled to the sidewalk and his attacker fled in a
brown van.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the club, strippers whom Segal had befriended broke down
in tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``The customers were crying,'' Jaguar said. ``They were punching
walls. They said, `Why did it have to be him?'''
</P>
<P>
   An ambulance picked up Segal and accelerated down Broadway. A
block away it slowed slightly while a pedestrian scurried out of
the way: It was Flanagan.
</P>
<P>
   ``That night I went for a walk in North Beach and saw an
ambulance and walked right by where it happened,'' she said. ``I
had no idea.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Alas was arrested, Segal had died. The charge was
first-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Gaines, the court-appointed lawyer for Alas, could not
be reached for comment, but motions he filed in court indicate a
possible line of defense.
</P>
<P>
   Gaines might raise a combination of two legal defense concepts _
``voluntary intoxication'' and ``imperfect self-defense.'' In
short, he could claim that Alas was so drunk he believed,
incorrectly, that Segal represented a threat.
</P>
<P>
   If the jury accepts that argument, Alas might be found guilty of
voluntary manslaughter instead of murder.
</P>
<P>
   It would be his second felony conviction. In 1988, he received
three years probation on a robbery rap. Later his probation was
revoked and he was sentenced to two years in prison.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Jean's problem started in high school, with repeated bouts of
abdominal cramps, a perpetual bloated feeling and the need to visit
the bathroom dozens of times a day for long periods at a time but
without much relief. Now through college, married and working, Jean
has to get up hours ahead to get in enough bathroom time for her
chronically constipated bowel before she goes to work.
</P>
<P>
   Neither doctors nor dietary changes have provided more than a
brief respite from the symptoms, which cause her considerable
anxiety and embarrassment and make her unwilling to stay anywhere,
including at her in-laws' home, where there is only one bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Jean, who lives in Phoenix, suffers from a condition called
irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS, a chronic disorder of a seemingly
normal gut that national surveys have indicated afflicts as many as
one person in five, 70 percent of them women.
</P>
<P>
   Lillian, 33, has a different version of the same problem.
Instead of the chronic constipation that plagues Jean, Lillian is
beset by unpredictable bouts of diarrhea that can occur many times
a day. She says: ``IBS affects every aspect of my daily life. I
can't ride on a city bus or go to the park because there is no
bathroom. With the things that I can do, I constantly have to make
allowances like leaving extra time in case I experience an
episode.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the high incidence of the syndrome, it is common for a
sufferer to see many doctors over a period of years before getting
a proper diagnosis. Many patients endure costly, difficult tests
that reveal nothing, although some tests may be needed to rule out
more serious conditions. Experts estimate that up to 70 percent of
sufferers do not seek medical help.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with the bad news: irritable bowel syndrome is a
poorly understood and has no known cure. Though debilitating, it is
not fatal, it does not progress to something more serious and it
does not increase the risk of developing colon cancer or other
bowel diseases. According to Dr. Michael Camilleri, a
gastroenterologist at the Mayo Clinic, ``Long-term studies of
irritable bowel syndrome show that symptoms may disappear in time
and that the survival of these long-suffering patients is
unimpaired.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, several drug companies have promising medicines. A
recently approved drug, Lotronex by Glaxo Wellcome, can help women
with the syndrome and diarrhea. Another drug, Zelmac by Novartis,
is nearing approval, and it has helped those with bouts of bowel
syndrome accompanied by constipation.
</P>
<P>
   The syndrome has long been misunderstood. Through the years it
has been called many things, some of which are inaccurate,
including colitis and mucous colitis (unlike real colitis, there is
no inflammation in IBS), spastic colon and functional bowel
disease. Contrary to widespread belief among the public and in
medicine, irritable bowel syndrome is a real condition. It is not a
psychosomatic disorder, although its symptoms can be aggravated by
stress, anxiety, depression or emotional trauma.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the syndrome is believed to stem from abnormal nerve
connections between the brain and gut, resulting in extreme
sensitivity to bowel contractions and the passage of gas and
fluids. Nerves that control muscles in the gut seem to overreact to
gas or to food after a meal, resulting in painful spasms that may
either speed or slow the passage of stool and cause diarrhea or
constipation. In some sufferers, symptoms alternate between
diarrhea and constipation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to emotional distress, the symptoms of the syndrome
can be made worse by certain habits, like eating big or irregular
meals and fatty or spicy foods, as well as by specific foods.
Although food sensitivities vary, problems commonly come from
chocolate, caffeinated and carbonated beverages, dairy products
containing lactose, foods sweetened with sorbitol or mannitol,
gas-producing vegetables like cabbage, beans and broccoli and
fruits like grapes and raisins, cherries and cantaloupe.
</P>
<P>
   Diets rich in fiber help control diarrhea and constipation. But
there is a catch: many high-fiber foods increase intestinal gas and
can cause more cramping. So go slowly when trying to increase
dietary fiber to give your system a chance to adjust. And if
high-fiber foods don't do the trick, you might try taking a fiber
supplement like psyllium (Metamucil, for example), which may be
better tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   If diarrhea is a problem, avoid fatty foods; they stimulate the
bowel more than any other food. If you are lactose-intolerant,
choose lactose-reduced dairy products (there are lactose-free
versions of milk, cottage cheese and ice cream), low-fat hard
cheeses and yogurt with active cultures.
</P>
<P>
   Check the labels on dietetic foods and sugar-free candy and gum.
Pass up those with sorbitol or mannitol, which can cause diarrhea.
Eat small regular meals and don't rush them. Sit down, relax and
enjoy them. Avoid chewing gum, talking while eating and eating too
quickly; all cause you to swallow air and increase intestinal gas.
</P>
<P>
   Keep a food-and-symptom diary to determine which foods bother
you most and try to avoid them. If you think you are sensitive to
something, don't eat it for two weeks, then gradually reintroduce
it to see if your symptoms get worse. Note, too, that tobacco,
alcohol, caffeine and spicy foods are common irritants that may
cause a bad reaction. Certain medications, like antacids containing
magnesium, may also cause problems for people with diarrhea. Keep
track of them as well.
</P>
<P>
   As for nonfood remedies, perhaps the most important is regular
exercise to help normalize bowel function. Exercise is also a great
stress reliever. Other stress-reducing activities include
meditation, sports and hobbies. Cognitive behavioral therapy,
hypnotherapy or traditional psychotherapy can help people whose
symptoms are aggravated by stress.
</P>
<P>
   Do not take laxatives for constipation; they can permanently
impair gut motility. A fiber supplement, which acts as a bulking
agent, is far preferable. Camilleri of the Mayo Clinic suggests an
``osmotic'' laxative like milk of magnesia or lactulose or a stool
softener. Whichever you use, be sure to drink plenty of water _
more than two quarts a day.
</P>
<P>
   If diarrhea proves unresponsive to dietary changes, an
antidiarrheal drug like Imodium (loperamide) can be used. Also, low
doses of tricyclic antidepressants can relieve both diarrhea and
abdominal pain, but these drugs should be avoided by those with
constipation. Other medications that may help, depending on the
person's illness pattern, include calcium channel blockers,
somatostatin analogs and serotonergic antagonists.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   A bewildering array of groups has erupted in the past couple of
years in Los Angeles, sponsoring various Net-related social and
business events. Here's a quick rundown on a few of the most
notable:
</P>
<P>
   VIC (at www.thevic.org) is the 800-pound gorilla of the Net
social whirl. When it was founded five years ago, its initials
stood for Venice Interactive Community. In a few weeks, with an
infusion of capital, a conversion to for-profit status and a
wide-ranging expansion to dozens of other cities, VIC will stand
for Virtual International Community, said executive director Brad
Nye.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've created a monster that's too big for me,'' said Nye only
half-jokingly.
</P>
<P>
   VIC now has 20 employees running six to 10 events a month of
various sorts for 2,000 members who pay $125 to $250 a year to
belong, plus extra fees for some events.
</P>
<P>
   VIC also is opening the Digital Evolution Center, a
10,000-square-foot headquarters and career development facility
just off Santa Monica's Third Street Promenade.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterly Zone Club features a couple of high-profile local
speakers as the evening's centerpiece, with cocktails beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   Members also get subscriptions to tech business magazine Zone
News, access to libraries of business information, invitations to
special events and more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all really comes down to creating the culture here,'' said
David Cremin of Zone Ventures. ``We wanted to catalyze the
technology culture. We've been able to accelerate and catalyze this
process. We're still a few years behind Silicon Valley, but a
couple of years ago we were a decade behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Zone Club's proceeds go to a variety of local
charities, such as New Economics for Women and L.A. Shares, that
help improve the community, Cremin said.
</P>
<P>
   STEP UP, which Kaye Popofsky founded to help mentor women in
entertainment and technology, also has a philanthropic aspect.
Every year it raises hundreds of thousands of dollars for
organizations devoted to breast cancer research and women's and
children's health issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mantra is that community and social activities and career
shouldn't be separated, especially in entertainment,'' said
Popofsky.
</P>
<P>
   First Tuesday started in London about a year ago, and has now
spread to 85 cities, mostly in Europe but including 10 U.S. cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people here in Los Angeles saw First Tuesday
as an opportunity to tap into the global business over there,''
said local chapter founder Giovanna Imbesi.
</P>
<P>
   The group, which now charges $10 for its monthly events,
typically features a panel of notables discussing a key technology
issue.
</P>
<P>
   First Tuesday's L.A. operation is an outgrowth of another
long-running social/business gathering, Pho, named after the
Chinatown Vietnamese soup restaurant where people interested in
music and technology have gathered on Sunday afternoons for more
than two years. It, too, has spawned chapters in 10 other cities.
</P>
<P>
   For more information on these and other groups, such as
iHollywood, the Association of Internet Professionals, e-Brew and
others, go the Digital Coast Roundtable's Web site, at
www.digitalcoast.org, which lists the groups and contact
information.
</P>
<P>
   Also, try the Southern California Technology Calendar, at
www.socaltechcalendar.com, for free listings of events by dozens of
tech groups of many kinds, from Santa Barbara to San Diego.

   On a night of painfully limited viewing options, consider taking
a look at two of the Sci Fi Channel's original series that are
making a minor splash for the cable network.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Invisible Man,'' airing at 8 and repeating at 11, stars
Vincent Ventresca as Darien Fawkes, a former small-time thief who
agrees, as an alternative to prison, to become a guinea pig in a
secret government experiment run by his brother. The mysterious
Quicksilver gland implanted at the base of Darien's skull allows
him to become invisible at will, but also turns him toward the dark
side, a la Mr. Hyde. Tonight, he discovers his ex-wife is seeing an
undercover agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farscape,'' at 9 and midnight, is one of those
across-the-galaxy-with-a-crew-of-assorted-aliens shows that pay
homage to ``Star Trek.'' Ben Browder stars as our hero, Crichton,
who's found himself very far from home. Tonight he and the gang
have to save the fierce D'Argo (Anthony Simcoe, under lots of alien
makeup) by catching a shape-shifting parasite.
</P>
<P>
   A third series, the lesser ``Lexx,'' airs at 10 and 1.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HIGHLIGHTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NFL preseason football, CBS at 8: The New York Giants visit the

tonight's topics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Providence,'' NBC at 8: Syd's mentor (guest star John Getz)
thinks he's found a case of Munchausen by proxy, in which a mother
causes her child harm because she enjoys the attention it brings.
But Syd (series star Melina Kanakaredes) offers another diagnosis.
Rerun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dateline,'' NBC at 9: How to get families out of public

</P>
<P>
   ``Mulan,'' Disney Channel at 7:30: Animated 1998 musical about a
young Chinese girl who takes her father's place in battle and
becomes a hero. Voice cast includes Ming-Na Wen, Lea Salonga, Eddie
Murphy, B.D. Wong, Donny Osmond and Harvey Fierstein. Matthew
Wilder (a one-hit wonder in the '80s with ``Break My Stride'')
wrote the songs.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CABLE CAST &LR;  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   ``Psycho,'' American Movie Classics at 8: OK, we've all seen
this 1960 Alfred Hitchcock chiller a hundred times, but it's still
one of the signature films of the second half of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Henry Rollins, Live and Ripped in London,'' Comedy Central at
9: OK, the pumped-up punk rocker and poet is not exactly Richard

   Reba McIntyre hosts ``The 2nd Annual Family Television Awards''
at 9 on CBS. It may sound like a show with a specific audience in
mind, but it's not all ``Touched By An Angel.'' In fact, the
winners are a diverse, high-quality group.
</P>
<P>
   The show honors TV that the whole family can watch together. The
winners' list was announced last week, so we can tell you that CBS'
``Everybody Loves Raymond'' garnered the best comedy award, and
NBC's ``West Wing'' nabbed best drama.
</P>
<P>
   Michael J. Fox was named best actor for his final season on
ABC's ``Spin City.'' It's an odd ``family'' choice, considering how
much sex talk is on that show, but maybe he gets points for his
battle with Parkinson's Disease.
</P>
<P>
   Best actress _ you knew this had to happen, right? _ goes to
Della Reese of CBS' ``Touched By An Angel.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC's ``Wonderful World of Disney'' gets the lifetime
achievement award. CNBC's ``National Geographic Explorer'' gets
best cable series. ABC's ``Oprah Winfrey Presents: Tuesdays with
Morrie'' wins best movie.
</P>
<P>
   In an ironic twist, ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' lands the
award for best alternative programming _ whatever that is. Ironic
because ``Millionaire'' also airs at 9 tonight, on ABC, and will
likely get a larger audience than this special.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HIGHLIGHTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Brother,'' CBS at 8: And speaking of irony, isn't it
strange that the network airing the ``Family Television Awards''
also airs this demeaning spectacle?
</P>
<P>
   ``Piano Grand,'' PBS at 8: Bill Joel, Diana Krall, Dave Brubeck
and Jerry Lee Lewis are some of the performers in this two-hour
piano special honoring the great tinklers of the ivory. It's tied
to a major Smithsonian exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friends,'' NBC at 8: The one where Ross begins dating a
student (Alexandra Holden) whose father turns out to be Bruce
Willis. Rerun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys on the Side,'' Fox at 8: Our chick flick du jour. Whoopi
Goldberg, Mary-Louise Parker, Drew Barrymore and Matthew
McConaughey star in this R-rated 1995 Thelma-and-Louise-and-Louise
tale.
</P>
<P>
   ``WWF Smackdown,'' UPN at 8: The opposite of the family-TV
awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' NBC at 9: Debbie Reynolds guests as Grace's
mother, who brings along a man _ for Will. Grace is miffed. Rerun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charmed,'' WB at 9: Battle with a water demon at a summer camp
has a personal angle for the sisters. Rerun.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FAMILY FARE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``SpongeBob SquarePants,'' Nickelodeon at 8: SpongeBob and
Patrick convince Mr. Krabs to join in a friendly board game of
``Treasure Hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CABLE CAST &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Drinking Apart: Families Under the Influence,'' HBO at 7:15: A
look at how alcoholism affects three New York families.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hustler,'' American Movie Classics at 8: Paul Newman and
Jackie Gleason at their best, with George C. Scott and more _ look
for Jake ``Raging Bull'' LaMotta _ in the 1961 pool room drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cleopatra,'' Turner Classic Movies at 8: The 1913 silent
directed by Charles Gaskill, starring Helen Gardner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Swept Away ... By an Unusual Destiny in the Blue Sea of
August,'' Bravo at 8: Lina Wertmuller's arty, sexy, class-focused
1976 comedy about a shipwrecked aristocrat and a hunky Marxist.
</P>
<P>
   ``MTV Real World Reunion 2000,'' MTV at 11:30: Former castmates
get back together. Maybe they'll reveal what they really think
about ``Big Brother.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LATE NIGHT TALK &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Late Show with David Letterman,'' CBS at 11:35: Jennifer Lopez
and Eels.

Parker of ``Sex and the City,'' cable bigmouth Chris Matthews and
rainforest protector Sting.

   The cars pull up to a sprawling Victorian house on Santa
Monica's Main Street, disgorging young people who sidle up to
tables of assistants, checking for their names against lengthy
lists.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, a jazz band is playing just a little too loud for
conversation, while out back, by the bar and on the front patio,
folks are jammed cheek-by-jowl, eyeing name tags, swirling drinks,
swapping business cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like coming home,'' coos Fran Pomerantz as she sweeps up
the walk and into the party.
</P>
<P>
   Pomerantz is an Internet executive-search consultant and one of
the early organizers of VIC, the 5-year-old organization sponsoring
tonight's event. More than 500 people, mostly from Los Angeles'
booming Internet industry, will attend, just a day after another
VIC event that drew a similar turnout.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first of three tech-connected parties tonight, another
edition of the business-minded social whirl among the geek set in
Los Angeles. A burgeoning industry of Web-based entertainment and
new-media companies, with tens of thousands of tech-minded partying
people, has fueled the rapid growth of a network of networking
organizations in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be a new group springing up every day,'' said
Giovanna Imbesi of Los Angeles' chapter of First Tuesday, which
itself sprung up here only last spring after starting in London a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   For a business notorious for its asocial computer nerds
ensconced in coding caves before glowing cathode-ray tubes, there's
a lot of humanity interacting these days in Los Angeles'
interactive industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's also a large segment of the business where their
entire world is 17 inches (of computer screen). That's it,'' said
Christian Gray, publisher of the Southern California Technology
Calendar. ``This is their chance to get out and shake hands with
people they've been e-mailing.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just the organized gatherings of groups such as VIC
and First Tuesday. Conferences like last week's Herring on
Hollywood drew hundreds of participants who then hit a circuit of
show-related evening soirees for three straight nights. And
individual Web sites often celebrate major events with blow-out
parties such as the recent Artistdirect.com event featuring singer
k.d. lang at its sprawling Miracle Mile offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could literally go to a conference a day, especially in
L.A. or New York,'' said Imbesi. ``But I think some of this
phenomenon gets exaggerated in L.A. because most of the events have
some sort of entertainment slant to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this isn't just socializing, not in a town where
schmooze has been elevated to an art form, where every chance
meeting with cocktail in hand comes with a calculation of its
business implications. The Net set social whirl is all about
getting ahead, or at least catching up.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's a whole new world that's very different from the
entertainment business,'' said Tiffany Wagner, who recently joined
Massive Media, a West Hollywood Web company after working in
entertainment. ``This is all new to me. And I come here to work.
The companies we target, they're here and we let them know what
we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim Kelley of Brentwood, an ad saleswoman for AOL's local
operations, says she's scouting for new accounts, not new dates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business contacts is the reason I come here,'' Kelley said.
``If I get two or three contacts in a night, it's worth it. I don't
look at it as much as a scamming place as one for real business.''
</P>
<P>
   And in a fluid business where you're as likely to be partnering
with a company as competing against it, getting out is vital.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going out and forming groups and learning from each
other,'' said Kaye Popofsky, a record producer and founder of Step
UP, a support group for women in technology. ``It's smart; it
should be this way. Multimedia, unlike (traditional) entertainment,
is so expansive and so new, you can't do your job unless you know
what others are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexis de Tocqueville observed that Americans love to join
groups. Some 150 years later, the people in this newest of American
industries are joining with a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so many people out there, (the social scene) is just
growing in leaps and bounds,'' said Conchetta Fabares, executive
director of the Digital Coast Roundtable, which coordinates a
quarterly gathering of the leaders of more than 20 of the region's
tech networking groups, with a combined (though overlapping)
membership of 50,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people are new to it, and they're just learning,''
Fabares said. ``They're interested in communicating. They're trying
to network. That's by and large why these events are so
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray, the calendar publisher, tracks 80 to 100 events a month,
put on by 150 to 200 organizations. No one should be surprised, he
said, that the social scene is big enough to need the e-mail
service he provides.
</P>
<P>
   ``For better or worse, L.A. is a schmooze town,'' Gray said.
``You see the same thing in Silicon Valley and New York, but in the
fragmented area we're in, it creates huge opportunities for
gathering people together.''
</P>
<P>
   At these events, you're as likely to be chatting with a
Docker-clad CEO of a major Web services company, such as marchFIRST
managing director Nick Rothenberg, as to a junior marketing
employee like Wagner. And as the Net affects more and more other
businesses, local Net events have attracted a broader range of
participants.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't just 15 people hanging out in a chat room
anymore,'' said Rothenberg. ``This thing used to be entertainment
people mostly. Now you see people from some Fortune 500 company who
realize this is a center of the Internet business.''
</P>
<P>
   VIC puts on six to 10 events a month of various sorts, from
small executive-only gatherings of 100 to blow-out bashes of 2,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The original intent was to connect people on the Westside
involved in the emerging new-media scene, CD-ROMs and interactive
gaming,'' said VIC executive director Brad Nye. ``The Internet
wasn't even part of the conversation that first meeting, just five
years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   That's all changed radically of course. But the need for
face-to-face remains, Nye said, because it's good business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social and professional development go hand in hand,'' Nye
said. ``Good relationships build trust. And there's no industry
that facilitates this sort of interaction, business interaction,
like this one.''
</P>
<P>
   VIC's boom has encouraged other groups to form, often to create
more intimate gatherings than the often sprawling VIC gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   But staying small is very hard. Just ask David Cremin, a partner
at venture-capital firm Zone Ventures, who decided he wanted to
start something like the Churchill Club, a Silicon Valley
social/business staple. Cremin sent perhaps 175 e-mail invitations
to meet at a downtown restaurant a year ago in the first gathering
of the Zone Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four-hundred and fifty people showed up,'' Cremin said.
``There were lines around the block. It was complete disaster,
because we were so successful. We hit a hot button. People showed
up because they want to meet one another. They want to interact.'' &QL;

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Santa Monica, Calif. _ The cars pull up to a sprawling Victorian
house on Santa Monica's Main Street, disgorging young people who
sidle up to tables of assistants, checking for their names against
lengthy lists.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, a jazz band is playing just a little too loud for
conversation, while out back, by the bar and on the front patio,
folks are jammed cheek-by-jowl, eyeing name tags, swirling drinks,
swapping business cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like coming home,'' coos Fran Pomerantz as she sweeps up
the walk and into the party.
</P>
<P>
   Pomerantz is an Internet executive-search consultant and one of
the early organizers of VIC, the 5-year-old organization sponsoring
tonight's event. More than 500 people, mostly from Los Angeles'
booming Internet industry, will attend, just a day after another
VIC event that drew a similar turnout.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first of three tech-connected parties tonight, another
edition of the business-minded social whirl among the geek set in
Los Angeles. A burgeoning industry of Web-based entertainment and
new-media companies, with tens of thousands of tech-minded partying
people, has fueled the rapid growth of a network of networking
organizations in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be a new group springing up every day,'' said
Giovanna Imbesi of Los Angeles' chapter of First Tuesday, which
itself sprung up here only last spring after starting in London a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   For a business notorious for its asocial computer nerds
ensconced in coding caves before glowing cathode-ray tubes, there's
a lot of humanity interacting these days in Los Angeles'
interactive industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's also a large segment of the business where their
entire world is 17 inches (of computer screen). That's it,'' said
Christian Gray, publisher of the Southern California Technology
Calendar. ``This is their chance to get out and shake hands with
people they've been e-mailing.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just the organized gatherings of groups such as VIC
and First Tuesday. Conferences like last week's Herring on
Hollywood drew hundreds of participants who then hit a circuit of
show-related evening soirees for three straight nights. And
individual Web sites often celebrate major events with blow-out
parties such as the recent Artistdirect.com event featuring singer
k.d. lang at its sprawling Miracle Mile offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could literally go to a conference a day, especially in
L.A. or New York,'' said Imbesi. ``But I think some of this
phenomenon gets exaggerated in L.A. because most of the events have
some sort of entertainment slant to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this isn't just socializing, not in a town where
schmooze has been elevated to an art form, where every chance
meeting with cocktail in hand comes with a calculation of its
business implications. The Net set social whirl is all about
getting ahead, or at least catching up.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's a whole new world that's very different from the
entertainment business,'' said Tiffany Wagner, who recently joined
Massive Media, a West Hollywood Web company after working in
entertainment. ``This is all new to me. And I come here to work.
The companies we target, they're here and we let them know what
we're doing.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   A bewildering array of groups has erupted in the past couple of
years in Los Angeles, sponsoring various Net-related social and
business events. Here's a quick rundown on a few of the most
notable:
</P>
<P>
   VIC (at www.thevic.org) is the 800-pound gorilla of the Net
social whirl. When it was founded five years ago, its initials
stood for Venice Interactive Community. In a few weeks, with an
infusion of capital, a conversion to for-profit status and a
wide-ranging expansion to dozens of other cities, VIC will stand
for Virtual International Community, said executive director Brad
Nye.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've created a monster that's too big for me,'' said Nye only
half-jokingly.
</P>
<P>
   VIC now has 20 employees running six to 10 events a month of
various sorts for 2,000 members who pay $125 to $250 a year to
belong, plus extra fees for some events.
</P>
<P>
   VIC also is opening the Digital Evolution Center, a
10,000-square-foot headquarters and career development facility
just off Santa Monica's Third Street Promenade.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterly Zone Club features a couple of high-profile local
speakers as the evening's centerpiece, with cocktails beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   Members also get subscriptions to tech business magazine Zone
News, access to libraries of business information, invitations to
special events and more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all really comes down to creating the culture here,'' said
David Cremin of Zone Ventures. ``We wanted to catalyze the
technology culture. We've been able to accelerate and catalyze this
process. We're still a few years behind Silicon Valley, but a
couple of years ago we were a decade behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Zone Club's proceeds go to a variety of local
charities, such as New Economics for Women and L.A. Shares, that
help improve the community, Cremin said.
</P>
<P>
   STEP UP, which Kaye Popofsky founded to help mentor women in
entertainment and technology, also has a philanthropic aspect.
Every year it raises hundreds of thousands of dollars for
organizations devoted to breast cancer research and women's and
children's health issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mantra is that community and social activities and career
shouldn't be separated, especially in entertainment,'' said
Popofsky.
</P>
<P>
   First Tuesday started in London about a year ago, and has now
spread to 85 cities, mostly in Europe but including 10 U.S. cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people here in Los Angeles saw First Tuesday
as an opportunity to tap into the global business over there,''
said local chapter founder Giovanna Imbesi.
</P>
<P>
   The group, which now charges $10 for its monthly events,
typically features a panel of notables discussing a key technology
issue.
</P>
<P>
   First Tuesday's L.A. operation is an outgrowth of another
long-running social/business gathering, Pho, named after the
Chinatown Vietnamese soup restaurant where people interested in
music and technology have gathered on Sunday afternoons for more
than two years. It, too, has spawned chapters in 10 other cities.
</P>
<P>
   For more information on these and other groups, such as
iHollywood, the Association of Internet Professionals, e-Brew and
others, go the Digital Coast Roundtable's Web site, at
www.digitalcoast.org, which lists the groups and contact
information.
</P>
<P>
   Also, try the Southern California Technology Calendar, at
www.socaltechcalendar.com, for free listings of events by dozens of
tech groups of many kinds, from Santa Barbara to San Diego.

A SMALL WATCH COMPANY DEVELOPS INTO A HIP, RETAIL CLOTHING CHAIN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By ALYSON WARD 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 RICHARDSON, Texas _ There's something familiar about the brand-new
clothing store in one of the big malls in Fort Worth, 45 miles or
so to the east of Richardson. Quirky pop music (heavy on the Moby)
provides an energetic shopping soundtrack. Khakis and skirts, jeans
and T-shirts have coordinating accessories available at the
counter. For cotton collectors, grand-opening T-shirts are a gift
with purchase. And on well-spaced wood-and-metal tables, crisply
folded jeans and shirts are stacked in neat rows to draw in
youthful casual-clothes shoppers.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The store has the fresh-scrubbed, adolescent ambience of
Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch combined with the friendly attitude of Old Navy
and a design sensibility echoing that of the venerable Gap.
</P>
<P>
   But, nope _ it's Fossil, Inc. You know, the watch people. The
Richardson-based company _ which has been on a winning streak since
it sold its first watches in the mid-1980s _ has already made a
solid name for itself in the world of accessories. After years of
soaring sales of watches and leather goods, Fossil is branching out
into clothing; more than a dozen apparel stores will open across
the country this year.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a company that began in a warehouse with a ``watch''
product that didn't even work. How does a little company with a
handful of employees importing watches evolve into a worldwide
company _ with a reported $420 million in net sales last year _
ready to take on retail giants like the Gap? Maybe it's all about
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Marketing indeed. We've heard tales about the two Greek brothers
who started Fossil out of a garage 16 years ago. We want to know
more about Tom Kartsotis and his brother Kosta (who still are CEO
and president, respectively), but when we call Fossil we're told
the Kartsotis brothers don't give interviews. Not only are they
very private people, but, we are informed, Fossil isn't about the
founders. Fossil is about everyone who works there.
</P>
<P>
   Oh.
</P>
<P>
   So instead, we talk to John Talbott, who is the company's vice
president for, uh, marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott offers a tour of the company headquarters, complete with
a running commentary on the company's past, its present, its future
... and its marketing techniques.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always been a company that looks very closely at what's
selling,'' Talbott said. ``Our idea has always been to try a lot of
things and find out which ones the consumers respond to.''
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes those consumers surprise you. The company first
hit it big in 1986 with a wrist sundial. As in, an ancient Egyptian
timepiece in convenient wristwatch form. That's right: Fossil's
first big watch wasn't really a watch at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't work; it was just a plastic sundial,'' Talbott said.
But the item sold out in stores. Who knew?
</P>
<P>
   The company knew it was onto something big, though. The sundial
watch was part of a group called the Fossil Collection, novelty
watches that had a stonelike, ``fossilized'' look to them. The
entire collection sold well, so the company, which had opened two
years earlier as a watch-importing company, changed directions; it
started ``designing'' watches full time and changed its name from
the clunky Overseas Product Co. to the simple and catchy
``Fossil.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Fossil pays tribute to the product that made it big: In
front of the company's headquarters in Richardson, a giant yellow
sundial protrudes from the ground. (This one really works, we're
informed. We don't doubt it; these people make timepieces.)
</P>
<P>
   After the sundial, Fossil expanded its watch line and gained a
foothold in the fashion industry. In 1989, offbeat marketing
brilliance struck again. The company began packaging some of its
watches in colorful tin boxes decorated with black-and-white photos
and classic images from the 1950s. Guess what _ the boxes were a
hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tried a few (tins) with the '50s imagery, and lo and
behold, again we found out _ wow! Those watches that are in the tin
box are selling really well! Why don't we put everything in a tin
box?'' Talbott said.
</P>
<P>
   So they did. The limited-edition tins _ with 120 new designs
every year _ have been given away with accessories purchases ever
since. The tins are collectors' items. The free-gift-with-purchase
concept makes Fossil products even more appealing. And the tins'
blend of modern and retro American design has become a Fossil brand
image.
</P>
<P>
   Tins are lined up in display cases at Fossil's headquarters,
mixed in with some classic watches and 1950s Americana. It's a
temptation to stand there, cooing over the cute boxes, but Talbott
is ready to whisk through the rest of the building. To the design
department, where designers use high-tech software and equipment
and work to get new products into stores while they're still
trendy. To the creativity department, where messy desks and easels
nearly hide the artists at work on new Fossil designs (Fossil
creates 250-300 new watch models each year). To the Web department,
where designers are working on the newest part of Fossil's Web site
(www.fossil.com), which offers clothing from the new apparel line.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Talbott's tour has made it back to the starting
point _ the marketing department _ we're completely sold on the
company. We don't just want a watch from Fossil _ we want a JOB
from Fossil. Fossil marketing has worked its magic again, even on
the cynical press.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
nn
</P>
<P>
   With Fossil's marketing techniques, it's no wonder the company
has grown steadily since its watch lines took off in 1986. It
expanded with leather goods in the early 1990s and soon after, the
company went public on the NASDAQ exchange as FOSL. In 1995, Fossil
moved into the sunglasses market; each new venture has been
welcomed by eager buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Fossil doesn't over-invest in inventory until a product shows
success with consumers, explained Talbott. When a product sells
well, Fossil then goes wild producing more, with numerous
variations; the unsuccessful products simply don't stay. Stores
don't keep much inventory around, so nothing gets old. And Fossil
has more than 30 outlet stores to get rid of old inventory.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Make more of what works and less of what doesn't' is
basically our methodology,'' Talbott said. ``It sounds so simple,
but it's really sort of different from the way a lot of fashion
companies operate.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, whatever the company's methodology is, it's working.
Fossil is distributed in more than 80 countries worldwide, with
subsidiaries throughout Europe, and in Japan and China. In fact,
Talbott said a full third of Fossil's business is in other
countries. And Fossil sells more products through another line
called Relic, which can be found in middle-tier stores, such as
Target and J.C. Penney.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott said the current expansion of Fossil with an apparel
line was ``a natural evolution.'' It was simply time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always thought we would be in apparel,'' he said. ``We've
always kind of had that in the back of our mind.''
</P>
<P>
   By year's end, Fossil stores will open in more than a dozen
locations, including New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Seattle,
Minnesota's Mall of America.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   So what about this new clothing? It's nice. Casual.
All-American. But like Fossil's watches and other accessories, it's
not unusual or spectacular. Instead, it's basic, midpriced,
youthful _ and extremely well-marketed.
</P>
<P>
   The new Fort Worth store, which opened in the last week of July,
already has a lot of young people meandering through. That's
appropriate; the merchandise is aimed at buyers ages 16 to 24, many
of whom will probably wander over from the neighboring outposts of
Banana Republic and the Gap.
</P>
<P>
   The focus is on trends, said Julie Kramer, Fossil's vice
president of merchandising for stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's whatever's happening at the moment: beaded, western,
fringe, animal, studded, embellished in any way,'' she said. ``It's
very young and very trendy in nature _ right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Aiming merchandise at 16- to 24-year-olds ``right now'' is a
good business move for Fossil. The age group has tremendous
purchasing power, with lots of money to spend on clothing and
accessories; the average American teen had $94 a week of disposable
income last year. Fossil has gotten its share of that wealth
through accessories sales; the brand appeals most to young
consumers already.
</P>
<P>
   But the gimmicks and packaging _ in other words, great marketing
_ are what will attract young buyers to the clothing line.
Different jeans styles have names _ Norm, Jessie, Ginger, Dale.
Shirts have appealing freebies attached to hang tags _ on the
current knit tops, it's a mini-sticker book. Online buyers are
currently offered a free notebook.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have all kinds of really cool giveaway free items every
month _ maybe it's a notebook, maybe it's a sticker pad, maybe it's
a Christmas ornament,'' Kramer said.
</P>
<P>
   The giveaways will change constantly; so will the merchandise
and the labels. It's a brilliant marketing move _ which is just
what to expect from Fossil.
</P>
<P>
   There's a high emphasis on packaging.

   ``From the beginning, when you open a store, you can choose to
decide what you want to be ... or you can just copy someone,''
Kramer said. You can say, ``I want to be Banana Republic,' or `I
want to be Abercrombie' like the rest of the retail world wants to
be, and you go knock that off. Well, who needs another one of THOSE
out there?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed.
</P>
<P>
   To the casual shopper, the new Fossil apparel store _ which also
offers a youthful selection of the company's watches and
accessories _ looks, well, a lot like those other stores.
</P>
<P>
   But there's something that works about Fossil. The jeans and
cotton shirts, khakis and knit tops are as appealing as they are
ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   If Fossil clothing has a trademark look, it's a lack of a
trademark _ a look that Kramer calls random.

random. It all somehow comes together.''

A SMALL WATCH COMPANY DEVELOPS INTO A HIP, RETAIL CLOTHING CHAIN
</HEADLINE>
  (Resending first take only to fix coding. No other changes).

 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHARDSON, Texas _ There's something familiar about the
brand-new clothing store in one of the big malls in Fort Worth, 45
miles or so to the east of Richardson. Quirky pop music (heavy on
the Moby) provides an energetic shopping soundtrack. Khakis and
skirts, jeans and T-shirts have coordinating accessories available
at the counter. For cotton collectors, grand-opening T-shirts are a
gift with purchase. And on well-spaced wood-and-metal tables,
crisply folded jeans and shirts are stacked in neat rows to draw in
youthful casual-clothes shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   The store has the fresh-scrubbed, adolescent ambience of
Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch combined with the friendly attitude of Old Navy
and a design sensibility echoing that of the venerable Gap.
</P>
<P>
   But, nope _ it's Fossil, Inc. You know, the watch people. The
Richardson-based company _ which has been on a winning streak since
it sold its first watches in the mid-1980s _ has already made a
solid name for itself in the world of accessories. After years of
soaring sales of watches and leather goods, Fossil is branching out
into clothing; more than a dozen apparel stores will open across
the country this year.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a company that began in a warehouse with a ``watch''
product that didn't even work. How does a little company with a
handful of employees importing watches evolve into a worldwide
company _ with a reported $420 million in net sales last year _
ready to take on retail giants like the Gap? Maybe it's all about
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Marketing indeed. We've heard tales about the two Greek brothers
who started Fossil out of a garage 16 years ago. We want to know
more about Tom Kartsotis and his brother Kosta (who still are CEO
and president, respectively), but when we call Fossil we're told
the Kartsotis brothers don't give interviews. Not only are they
very private people, but, we are informed, Fossil isn't about the
founders. Fossil is about everyone who works there.
</P>
<P>
   Oh.
</P>
<P>
   So instead, we talk to John Talbott, who is the company's vice
president for, uh, marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott offers a tour of the company headquarters, complete with
a running commentary on the company's past, its present, its future
... and its marketing techniques.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always been a company that looks very closely at what's
selling,'' Talbott said. ``Our idea has always been to try a lot of
things and find out which ones the consumers respond to.''
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes those consumers surprise you. The company first
hit it big in 1986 with a wrist sundial. As in, an ancient Egyptian
timepiece in convenient wristwatch form. That's right: Fossil's
first big watch wasn't really a watch at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't work; it was just a plastic sundial,'' Talbott said.
But the item sold out in stores. Who knew?
</P>
<P>
   The company knew it was onto something big, though. The sundial
watch was part of a group called the Fossil Collection, novelty
watches that had a stonelike, ``fossilized'' look to them. The
entire collection sold well, so the company, which had opened two
years earlier as a watch-importing company, changed directions; it
started ``designing'' watches full time and changed its name from
the clunky Overseas Product Co. to the simple and catchy
``Fossil.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Fossil pays tribute to the product that made it big: In
front of the company's headquarters in Richardson, a giant yellow
sundial protrudes from the ground. (This one really works, we're
informed. We don't doubt it; these people make timepieces.)
</P>
<P>
   After the sundial, Fossil expanded its watch line and gained a
foothold in the fashion industry. In 1989, offbeat marketing
brilliance struck again. The company began packaging some of its
watches in colorful tin boxes decorated with black-and-white photos
and classic images from the 1950s. Guess what _ the boxes were a
hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tried a few (tins) with the '50s imagery, and lo and
behold, again we found out _ wow! Those watches that are in the tin
box are selling really well! Why don't we put everything in a tin
box?'' Talbott said.
</P>
<P>
   So they did. The limited-edition tins _ with 120 new designs
every year _ have been given away with accessories purchases ever
since. The tins are collectors' items. The free-gift-with-purchase
concept makes Fossil products even more appealing. And the tins'
blend of modern and retro American design has become a Fossil brand
image.
</P>
<P>
   Tins are lined up in display cases at Fossil's headquarters,
mixed in with some classic watches and 1950s Americana. It's a
temptation to stand there, cooing over the cute boxes, but Talbott
is ready to whisk through the rest of the building. To the design
department, where designers use high-tech software and equipment
and work to get new products into stores while they're still
trendy. To the creativity department, where messy desks and easels
nearly hide the artists at work on new Fossil designs (Fossil
creates 250-300 new watch models each year). To the Web department,
where designers are working on the newest part of Fossil's Web site
(www.fossil.com), which offers clothing from the new apparel line.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Talbott's tour has made it back to the starting
point _ the marketing department _ we're completely sold on the
company. We don't just want a watch from Fossil _ we want a JOB
from Fossil. Fossil marketing has worked its magic again, even on
the cynical press.

   INDONESIA-WAHID (Jakarta, Indonesia) _ A newly humble President
Abdurrahman Wahid apologized Monday for falling short of
expectations as Indonesia gropes for a political path after 32
years of dictatorship and said he would name an executive minister
to bring order to his flailing administration. In a state-of-the
nation speech that opened a restive annual parliamentary session,
Wahid said he would in the future concentrate more on foreign
affairs _ he has visited 30 countries, some several times, since
taking office 10 months ago _ and create a sort of prime
ministerial post to handle day-to-day domestic administration.
Admired for his integrity, democratic ideals and intellect, Wahid
has drawn constant criticism for his disorganized and impulsive
leadership style, particularly at a time when Indonesia struggles
with economic collapse, sectarian violence and political disarray.

   SCI-NILE-VIRUS (Undated) _ West Nile virus appears to be
settling in for the long haul. Almost one year after the Western
Hemisphere debut of the virus sent 62 people to hospitals,
eventually killing 7 of them with severe brain inflammation, the
bird-carried, mosquito-transmitted disease has struck again.
Despite widespread spraying, many scientists expect that a
scattering of such cases and a few deaths, mostly in the elderly or
infirm, may well become the norm in years to come. More slowly than
expected, but steadily, the globe-hopping virus is dispersing from
last year's focal point in northern Queens County, in New York,
leaving a trail of dead birds that so far extends north to Boston,
west to Syracuse, N.Y., and south to Maryland. According to virus
experts, this pattern indicates that West Nile, which was first
identified in Uganda in 1937 and flares up sporadically in Africa,
Europe and the Middle East, appears ensconced in the New World. By

   SCI-CULTURE-THOUGHT (Undated) _ Western philosophers and
psychologists have based their discussions of mental life on a
cardinal assumption: that the same basic processes underlie all
human thought, whether in the mountains of Tibet or the grasslands
of the Serengeti. Cultural differences might dictate what people
thought about. But the habits of thought were the same for
everyone, exemplified by, among other things, a devotion to logical
reasoning, a penchant for categorization and an urge to understand
situations and events in linear terms of cause and effect. Recent
work, however, is turning this long-held view of mental functioning
upside down. A series of studies comparing European Americans to
East Asians has found that people who grow up in different cultures
do not just think about different things: they think differently.

   Hive Sweet Hive
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy said it best in ``The Wizard of Oz'': there's no place
like home. That's as true for a Kansas farm girl who finds herself
in the Emerald City as it is for migrating animals that return to
the same place year after year.
</P>
<P>
   But social insects that migrate are not known to be particularly
faithful to their home base. Except, it turns out, the Asian giant
honeybee, Apis dorsata.
</P>
<P>
   People in southern parts of Asia who collect the bees' honey
know that the same nest sites _ usually in trees or the eaves of
houses _ will be occupied year after year by migrating swarms.
</P>
<P>
   Now, two reports in the journal Nature show that these nest
sites are being occupied by swarms that are related. Researchers in
India and Malaysia analyzed the DNA of bees found at the same
nesting sites over several years.
</P>
<P>
   Both groups found that from year to year swarms with the same
queen, or with a queen that was the daughter of the previous year's
queen, end up at the sites. Since worker bees live for only about
two weeks, some sort of genetic mechanism must be at work, the
researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   Unpredictable Comet
</P>
<P>
   Comet Linear, which made its closest approach to Earth last
month, was a bust in more ways than one.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was one of the brighter comets in years, early
predictions that it would be visible to the naked eye did not pan
out. The comet, which was discovered in 1999, reached a maximum
magnitude of 6 to 6.5, meaning it was not bright enough to be seen
without binoculars or a telescope.
</P>
<P>
   But for professional astronomers, Linear held some surprises.
For one thing, jets of gas from the comet caused slight
disturbances in its orbit. Astronomers suggested that this was
because Linear was probably making its first pass near the Sun.
Being fresh, it had lots of ice and other compounds to vaporize as
it heated up.
</P>
<P>
   But the big surprise came around July 26, when the comet made
its closest approach to the Sun. Heating of the icy core apparently
became so intense that the comet started to disintegrate.
</P>
<P>
   Breakup of a comet is not unknown _ one notable example being
Shoemaker-Levy 9, which broke up before it crashed into Jupiter in
1994. But that breakup left relatively large fragments. Comet
Linear, on the other hand, is spewing its mass into space like a
puffball in the wind, leaving nothing but dust behind. It is
expected to disappear completely.
</P>
<P>
   Mapping a Protein
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made, and rightly so, about the project to
sequence the human genome and the effect it will have on research
into genetics and disease. But the genome, in a way, is really just
a blueprint. It is the proteins that it encodes that actually do
the work inside the cell. Understanding the nature of those
proteins is crucial as well.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have taken a big step in that direction, mapping for
the first time the crystal structure of a type of protein called a
G protein-coupled receptor. These are among the most common
proteins encoded by the genome.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, from the University of Washington and other
institutions, reported in the journal Science that they had mapped
the structure of a GPCR called rhodopsin, which functions in the
retina. Rhodopsin is one of the body's links to the outside world,
converting light into a signal that is sent to the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding rhodopsin's structure (which is highly complex, as
the molecule contains about 350 amino acids) should help
researchers to understand how it interacts with other molecules,
which could eventually aid in the design of drugs to combat various
eye problems.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps more important, since all GPCR's have the same basic
structure, knowledge of rhodopsin should help in understanding how
the others function. And since the proteins play a vital role in so
many areas, from the development of the embryo to the beating of
the heart, understanding how they function should aid research into
a variety of diseases.

VH1 REALITY SHOW PUTS FLICKERSTICK IN THE HOT SEAT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ For local rock band Flickerstick, ``The Real
World'' is their real world.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Fort Worth-based alternative-rock quintet filmed
a pilot for a new show on cable music channel VH1, ``Bands on the
Run,'' which, if picked up, will start airing next year.
</P>
<P>
   It's yet another ``reality'' program, in which the band's every
move will be filmed.
</P>
<P>
   Because the group signed a confidentiality agreement, similar to
those signed by the cast and crews of ``The Real World, Survivor,
Big Brother'' and other like-minded, tight-lipped shows, the band
cannot discuss the details of what happened on the trip.
</P>
<P>
   They must, in other words, carefully tiptoe through this
interview; ditto for their manager, Paul Bassman; the show's
director, Dan Cutforth; and, well, just about anyone and everyone
associated with ``Bands on the Run.'' ``Please don't quote me,'' is
a recurring, uh, quote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to keep our noses clean with VH1,'' said the
band's lead singer, Brandin Lea, when asked about the show. ``They
don't want us to talk about what happened because, well, they want
people to watch the show and see for themselves. The worst part
about it is, we don't know what we CAN say about it.''
</P>
<P>
   This much is known, though: At this point, the show chronicles
the lives of the members of Flickerstick _ and two other national
bands _ while they're on a 13- to 20-week U.S. tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept is following these three bands on tour, and
looking at life on the road, and the dynamics and inner workings of
a band,'' said Jane Lipsitz, vice president of development for VH1.
</P>
<P>
   And like on ``Survivor,'' a competition is involved.
</P>
<P>
   Lipsitz said the music channel will book the three bands in
various clubs, and whichever band promotes its shows the hardest _
in other words, gets the most people out to its gigs _ will win a
prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you what the (prize) is, but it'll be a
significant one for an independent band,'' Lipsitz said.
</P>
<P>
   The VH1 gig could not have come at a better time for
Flickerstick, which is rounded out by Brandin's brother, bassist
Fletcher Lea, guitarists Cory Krieg and Rex James Ewing, and
drummer Dominic Weir.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 15, the group will release a new CD, ``Welcoming Home
the Astronauts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one reason why we went ahead and decided to do this: to
get the CD heard,'' says Brandin Lea. ``We talked about it for a
long time, you know, `Do we really want to have cameras following
us around for weeks?' And we know we're gonna take some heat for
doing the show. We know we're going to be called sellouts. But we
decided that, yeah, we want people to hear our record, and this is
a great opportunity for that to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But the gig could not have come at a worse time for viewership;
the airwaves are flooded with reality shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it kind of sucks that there are so many shows like
that,'' Brandin says. ``But this seems more like a documentary. And
the whole show could very well change. That's one reason they don't
want us to talk about it _ nothing about it is set in stone.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before VH1 approached Flickerstick, there was already a
buzz surrounding them. Formed three years ago, the band quickly
developed a loyal local following, a crowd of friends and fans who
jammed places such as the Aardvark in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   About a year and a half ago, though, the band jettisoned its
hard-rock formula for its current, more accessible psychedelic-pop
sound. While a few fans turned their backs, the group soon found
itself playing to even bigger audiences. Today, their club shows in
Fort Worth are usually sold out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a completely different band now,'' Brandin says. ``We
put out a record a few years ago, but we've changed so much since
then that we'd like to forget it. We think of (the new record) as
our debut.''
</P>
<P>
   After the sonic makeover, in stepped Bassman, who offered to
manage the group and help fund the new disc. On a whim, Bassman,
who has worked with current chart-toppers Vertical Horizon,
submitted a demo of Flickerstick's new material to Billboard
magazine for an online talent search.
</P>
<P>
   Bassman said that Billboard was so floored by the demo, they
placed a track from it on a music-industry CD compilation, which
eventually made its way to VH1.
</P>
<P>
   ``They called me up and said they loved the song and were
working on a TV show about bands that had family members in it, and
since Brandin and Fletcher were brothers, they wanted to interview
them,'' Bassman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it didn't even get past the initial production,'' he said.
``We kept in contact, and they called me again about `Bands on the
Run.' We had just finished recording the new CD, so I sent it to
them in its most rough as possible form. Even so, they loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   What followed were weeks of interviews and showcases for VH1
reps, all of which have been kept hush-hush _ and all of which have
been filmed.
</P>
<P>
   Brandin admits that the presence of camera crews added a new
layer of pressure on an already somewhat turmoil-plagued band.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that might be one reason why they like us, because
there is some inner-band turmoil,'' he said. ``And having the
cameras there definitely added to it. We thought there'd be a lot
more fun and games, but it was far more intense than we imagined.''
</P>
<P>
   One fear that the band realizes it will have to deal with is a
backlash _ from local fans who can't believe their favorite unknown
group is on VH1, as well as from people who scrutinize them simply
for being on the show rather than for their music.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be on TV before the radio, there's definitely going to be
some backlash,'' Brandin says. ``If there's anyone who doesn't like
us because we're on TV, well, they don't understand how cutthroat
it is to even be known in the industry. We've gotten this
opportunity to get around the bull and red tape. I'm sure there
will be consequences for it.''

   OAKLAND, Calif. _ In a time when full-time academic appointments
are hard to come by, some mathematics Ph.D.'s may consider the
career path taken by Dr. Charles Brenner, 55, one of the world's
first fully employed freelance mathematicians.
</P>
<P>
   Brenner calls himself a forensic mathematician and his business
card reads, ``Charles H. Brenner, Ph.D., Aphorisms, Inferences and
Conclusions From Thin Air.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of his work with his consulting company, DNA-View,
Brenner travels around the globe helping scientists do the
mathematical calculations necessary to analyze DNA evidence. He
also advises in paternity cases.
</P>
<P>
   Brenner has always been a math rebel. In the 1970s, a time when
he should have been finishing his graduate studies, he went to
London where he supported himself for six years by playing bridge.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to the United States in 1974 to get his doctorate in
number theory from the University of California at Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   After completing his degree in 1984, he found that some software
consulting he had been doing over the years seemed to evolve into
new work in mathematical consulting associated with DNA
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like teaching as an academic visitor,'' Brenner explained on
a recent afternoon while sitting in his office in his home here.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, in many places, the academic environment can be
stultifying,'' he said. ``So this is a wonderful alternative. I get
to travel the world, encounter different cultures, rub shoulders
with some great scientists, and I get to look at vexing human
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Q. What exactly is a forensic mathematician?
</P>
<P>
   A. It's a term that I invented. It has to do with the
application of mathematics in the courts. Virtually all I do is DNA
identification. The most obvious example is I work out
probabilities.
</P>
<P>
   If you have, for instance, genetic material derived from the
crime scene, you have a suspect, and the DNA matches _ the question
is, Do they match by coincidence, and if so, how big a coincidence
is it? There are population studies that show how common various
DNA traits are. In the case of stain-matches, all I have to do is
multiply together a bunch of probabilities in order to get an
answer.
</P>
<P>
   I've worked for defense lawyers and for prosecutors. Also, a lot
of what I do is in paternity cases.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Your consultations for a Filipino court in the
paternity-inheritance case of the late California millionaire Larry
Hillblom made several Amerasian orphans very happy _ and rich. How
did that come to happen?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. A judge in Saipan asked me to advise. Hillblom had a fortune.
He'd used it to indulge his taste for sex with young Asian women.
After Hillblom died, there were all these young children scattered
all over the Asian-Pacific world. They were potential heirs
because, according to California law _ he was a Californian _ they
had not been specifically disinherited in a will.
</P>
<P>
   So to prove paternity, samples of Larry Hillblom's DNA were
needed. However, when an investigator went to Hillblom's Asian
homes, strangely no genetic material could be found. No hair, no
tooth brushes, none of the normal things are that are usual in any
home.
</P>
<P>
   Blood samples of these children and their mothers were then
assembled. None from Hillblom's California relatives were available
for that. The relatives wouldn't cough up any blood.
</P>
<P>
   There was a hospital in California that had a mole of
Hillblom's, but they refused to produce it. They subsequently
produced the wrong mole. It was all very strange.
</P>
<P>
   Given it was the only possibility, I designed a computer program
to look at the genetics of these children. Of the DNA profiles that
came to me, most of the children proved to have a similarity that
could only be explained if they had the same father. That, along
with evidence a relationship between the mothers and Hill-blom, won
the orphans a lot of money.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Software you designed has also been used in reuniting
families separated by the 1970s ``dirty war'' in Argentina. How
does that work?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, you know, in Argentina, there are about 300 adults who
were infants in the 1970s, and whose parents were murdered by the
military. These orphans were subsequently given to childless
military families to adopt. I've designed software, used by the
laboratory there, which helps make genetic identifications by
looking at the genes of still-living grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks ago, I got the case of an eminent Uruguayan, a
Nobel laureate, named Juan Gelman. His son and daughter-in-law fled
to Argentina from Uruguay in the 1970s, and they were killed there
as ``terrorists.'' Their little child was apparently auctioned off
to someone in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Through underground sources, Gelman was eventually able to find
out what happened to his grandchild. He was pretty sure a certain
young Argentine girl from a military family was her.
</P>
<P>
   The girl already had her own suspicions because her adoptive
father, on his deathbed, said, ``I hope you can forgive me,''
though he didn't say more. Gelman contacted the girl and gradually
revealed what he believed to be their kinship.
</P>
<P>
   My job was to make the calculation that nailed it down. I did
the calculations and the data was overwhelming consistent that this
girl was his grandchild.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The immigration services of several different countries have
bought your software. Why?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, in Denmark for instance, there is as law where if one
person has gained legal entry, then certain relatives are allowed
to immigrate, too. Well, in Somalia, where a lot of immigrants seem
to come from, there's a very broad definition of ``family.'' A
potential Somali immigrant to Denmark might feel he or she is
entitled because of membership in the same clan. When that happens,
the Danish authorities go to a DNA laboratory that uses my software
and who I consult for, to check the odds of a direct relationship.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is the most interesting thing you've learned about human
beings from your work?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. That quite a bit of adultery is intrafamily. One of the
problems that paternity labs come up with is where a man is accused
of paternity, and upon testing, it seems that he shares a lot of
genetic similarity with the child in question, but not enough to be
that child's father. What is going on here?
</P>
<P>
   In those cases, you always wonder if the man being sued is not a
father, might he not be the uncle! An uncle would explain this
evidence very well. So what we have is a woman who is having
relationships with a husband and the husband's brother. My
colleague Jeff Morris and I did an analysis some years ago in which
we came to the conclusion that this kind of relationship happens in
at least 1 percent to 10 percent of cases.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How did you develop this odd but interesting profession?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I come from a mathematical family. My father taught and my
mother was an artist and a politician _ she was mayor of Palo Alto.
In my family, practical mathematics was frowned on _ statisticians,
we didn't even talk of them. I find it rather amusing that I now do
very practical mathematics.
</P>
<P>
   But my history is this: I was in England during the Vietnam War,
avoiding the draft, and making a kind of living by playing bridge
for money. By the time the war was over, I returned to the U.S. and
graduate school, and I started developing a career for myself as a
software writer. The software writing led to creating this DNA
software. It's become a full-time business _ the software,
consulting, teaching. Basically, I'm a freelance mathematician.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is freelance mathematics lucrative?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It's not bad. I can do what I want, but I make less than most
senior academics.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The murder case where most of us learned about DNA evidence
was that of O.J. Simpson. How would you rate the presentation of
DNA issues during that trial?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The defense did something very clever from the DNA point of
view: they said the evidence was planted. Their basic strategy was
even if it matches, it was a plant. They gave up on the strategy of
disproving the DNA evidence. There obviously was a match in the
blood. They never denied it.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What did you think when you first heard of Monica Lewinsky's
unlaundered blue dress?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I tried not to pay attention. I was impressed by Bill
Clinton's toughness in the situation, but it did strike me that if
they could get a typing, his goose was cooked.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Does your work give you satisfaction?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Sure. We are always reading about people who are very
critical about the justice system. With this kind of work, at least
you have something you can hold on to. It's a tool that can make
the system more just.  &QL;

RESEARCH SUGGESTS PARENTS ARE NOT USING CHILD CAR SEATS PROPERLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By QIQI CHENG    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Researchers who analyzed thousands of car crashes report that
many parents are not using child car seats and booster seats
correctly and that proper protection drops sharply for children 3
to 8 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The American Academy of Pediatrics and government safety experts
recommend that babies up to 20 pounds travel in rear-facing car
seats; toddlers 20 to 40 pounds, generally those 1 to 4 years old,
in forward-facing car seats; and children between 40 and 80 pounds,
generally 4 to 8 years, in booster seats that make adult seat belts
fit well across children's hips, chests and shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   For the new analysis, researchers at Children's Hospital in
Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania examined State Farm
Insurance data on 30,000 crashes involving 48,000 children.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that 30 percent of babies below the age of 1 who
should travel in rear-facing car seats were turned forward. While
most parents used car seats properly for children up to age 2,
fewer than half the 3-year-olds were given the proper protection,
with nearly a third being graduated to booster seats before they
reached the recommended 40-pound threshold.
</P>
<P>
   The most striking safety lapse was for children 4 to 8: 83
percent were inappropriately put in adult seats instead of the
recommended belt-positioning booster seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to stress that child-specific restraint does not end
at age 2,'' said Dr. Flaura Koplin Winston, a pediatrics professor
at Children's Hospital and a principal researcher in the study.
</P>
<P>
   Even when parents were using car seats or booster seats, they
often made other errors, like failing to attach the seat tightly
enough or misusing the chest clip. In addition, 16 percent of those
12 and under were allowed to ride in the front seat, increasing
their risk of injury from a crash or air bag.
</P>
<P>
   The study found serious consequences from lack of proper
restraints. In crashes studied, 64 percent of injuries were
head-related.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the 2-to-5-year-olds, there is a fourfold decrease of
serious head injuries when those children are in car seats or
booster seats rather than inappropriately in adult seat belts,''
Winston said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration advises a
quick test on the car seat after its installation by firmly pulling
the base of the child seat forward and from the sides. A properly
installed car seat should not move more than one inch in any
direction.
</P>
<P>
   As for booster seats, Winston recommends belt-positioning
boosters that make the seat belts fit over children's hips, chests
and shoulders, rather than shield boosters, which use only lap
belts and could lead to ejection in a crash.
</P>
<P>
   Among advice from manufacturers is: Do not use strap covers,
blankets or cushions under harness straps because they may
interfere with proper fit; secure car seats with lap belts that
will not change lengths while driving; adults should not hold
children in their arms or share the same seat belt (a 20-pound
child in a car can put an extra force of 400 pounds on the adult's
arms during a crash at 30 miles an hour), and do not allow children
to hold lollipops or ice cream on a stick while riding in the car.

</P>
<P>
   After two smash films grossing a combined $840 million in
theaters, the Toy Story franchise is rocketing to infinity _ and
beyond the movie screen.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Buzz Lightyear, it's launching a new venture on video,
then speeding on to television.
</P>
<P>
   Now available in stores on VHS ($24.99) and DVD ($29.99) is
``Buzz Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure Begins.'' Coming
this fall is a Buzz TV series.
</P>
<P>
   The new movie has traditional hand-drawn artistry, not the
computer animation of ``Toy Story'' and ``Toy Story 2.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its title, it's also less a prequel to ``Toy Story''
than a spinoff. After all, Buzz never was a space hero in ``Toy
Story,'' just a deluded plaything.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in this 70-minute film _ as in the rollicking first scene of
``Toy Story 2'' _ he has the bold adventures he once only dreamed
about.
</P>
<P>
   Here, Buzz is, indeed, a powerful Space Ranger in the good-guy
Star Command _ sort of like interstellar Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   As a link to the toy universe we know, the film opens with new
computer animation of the Toy Story gang celebrating the arrival of
this videotape, then popping it into a VCR.
</P>
<P>
   For the segment, Wallace Shawn and R. Lee Ermey return to voice
Rex and Sarge, respectively, while Woody is voiced by Tom Hanks'
brother, Jim.
</P>
<P>
   The adventure begins with Buzz proclaiming, a la ``Dragnet's''
Joe Friday, ``This is the universe. I work here.''
</P>
<P>
   Still voiced with endearingly cornball swagger by Tim Allen,
Buzz must battle Evil Emperor Zurg, introduced at the start of
``Toy Story 2.''
</P>
<P>
   Voiced by Wayne Knight of ``3rd Rock From the Sun,'' Zurg seeks
the collective wisdom of the three-eyed little green men (we first
saw them as toys in a vending machine) as a power source. His goal:
galactic domination.
</P>
<P>
   You expected free ice cream for everyone?
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be all Zurg, all the time _ 24-7!'' Zurg exults in
crazed bombast.
</P>
<P>
   Buzz is bent on facing Zurg alone. He's lost one partner in
combat and resists endangering another.
</P>
<P>
   But as this film teaches, we all can use partners and pals.
Succinctly put, ``Everybody needs backup.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Buzz is preachy. It's even more action-driven than the
``Toy Story'' films _ too much so, at first.
</P>
<P>
   But it also unveils colorful new characters, including a
princess-turned-feisty Space Ranger (Nicole Sullivan), an amusing,
highly expressive robot named XR (Larry Miller), and an eager,
bulbous, fishlike janitor called Booster (Stephen Furst) who longs
to get his feet wet in space.
</P>
<P>
   The laughs lack the sneaky, adult-level wit of Toy Story, but
they're not overly childish, either.
</P>
<P>
   XR is seen reading ``Victoria's Circuits'' magazine, while Zurg
is an imperious hoot _ a testy tyrant who obsesses over image while
railing against his lackeys' incompetence.
</P>
<P>
   Zurg is high-maintenance, yet practical. When he creates a new
henchman he dubs ``Agent Z,'' he chortles, ``We'll save a fortune
on monogramming!''
</P>
<P>
   A few too many elements borrow from ``Star Wars,'' and the
Rangers' training room is straight out of the ``Danger Room'' of
old X-Men comics. But, as they say, steal from the best.
</P>
<P>
   As for the shift to flat, two-dimensional animation, once you
adjust, it's not bad.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect exquisite detail; this comes from a Japan-based
Disney studio geared to television. But the backgrounds are
fanciful, and the big-finned spaceships have a charming retro
style.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the film sags from too much action and not enough heart or
humor _ at least until the setup locks in. Then Buzz takes off with
spirited, adventurous fun _ and no interruptive songs.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, one does arise over the end credits, and it's a stitch:
William Shatner does his ironic talk-singing for ``To Infinity and
Beyond,'' a campy fight song backed by the ``Star Command Chorus.''
</P>
<P>
   Is this space heaven, or what?
</P>
<P>
   A bigger question is, can Buzz carry the ``Toy Story'' franchise
alone?
</P>
<P>
   Like Shatner's Captain Kirk, Buzz can be a pill. His heroic
resolve is rigid and naive, and his arrogance goes almost to
infinity. But his new team helps to loosen him up and soften the
edges of his gung-ho gusto.
</P>
<P>
   They'll all be back this fall, when ``Buzz Lightyear of Star
Command'' becomes a TV series for ABC (with 13 shows for Saturdays,
starting Oct. 14) and the Paramount Network and syndication (with
52 shows for weekdays and Sundays, starting Oct. 2).
</P>
<P>
   Allen won't provide Buzz's voice then; Patrick Warburton
(``Puddy'' of ``Seinfeld'') gets the gig. But if he's as good as
Jim Hanks as a sound-alike, the cartoon universe may still be in
good hands.
</P>
<P>
   DVD extras: ``Buzz Lightyear'' on DVD will have an onscreen
comic book with an option: you can read it, or have a narrator read
it to you.
</P>
<P>
   Discs also will sport a trivia game, with scores tallied and
ranked, and a ``Rogues' Gallery'' game that's a ``who's who'' of
Gamma Quadrant villains.
</P>
<P>
   On disc the film also has a widescreen image. &QL;

 &HT;    ISRAELI'S UNFAMILIAR WITH LIEBERMAN, BUT LIKE CHOICE
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (p) Politics categories.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ He keeps to Judaism's kosher dietary laws, observes
the Sabbath and helps clean up the image of the Clinton
administration. That's what Israelis began learning about
Connecticut Sen. Joseph Lieberman Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Most Israelis are not familiar with the man Democratic
presidential candidate Al Gore chose to be his vice presidential
running mate. But news shows quickly began introducing the Jewish
state to the first Jewish ticket partner for a major American
political party.
</P>
<P>
   Evening broadcasts carried Gore's choice high in the news _
though it was beaten for top story by a minor political scandal
here. Newscasters named the synagogue he attends in Washington, and
speculated briefly on whether his religion would help or hurt him
get votes for the Democratic ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Many Jewish Israelis do not keep the same strict adherence to
Judaism's dietary and Sabbath laws as does Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's very well-known,'' said Amos Eiran, an aide
to the late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in an interview
with Cox Newspapers. ``But, people who know Washington are very
proud of the fact that a Jewish senator will at least be nominated
to be vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   Eiran, a frequent commentator on U.S. politics, said Lieberman
frequently visits Israel and last came here a couple weeks ago. He
met with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and other officials on a
short visit.
</P>
<P>
   He said Lieberman knew Rabin well and is respected as a
consistent, though not ``blind'' supporter of Israel. Lieberman's
wife, Hadassah, volunteers in a project to help poor patients at
Jerusalem's Shaare Zedek Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Some Israeli media, which had been fascinated by the impeachment
scandal of President Bill Clinton, said Gore chose Lieberman
because he is seen as a moral force in U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   David Clayman, the Jerusalem representative for the American
Jewish Congress, told Israel radio that he heard that Lieberman and
Gore have long been friends. In their days together in the Senate,
Clayman said, Gore sometimes helped Lieberman keep to Jewish tenets
against turning on lights during the Sabbath by walking home with
him and turning his lights on for him.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis speculated that a Democratic ticket with a pro-Israel,
Jewish, vice presidential candidate would cause pressure on the
Palestinians to make a deal on the peace process before the
elections. Palestinians said they would withhold judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope that issues of Israeli relations don't become
paramount and that Mr. Gore and the Democrats are even-handed in
the peace process,'' Palestinian spokeswoman Hanan Ashrawi told
Israeli television.

<P>
   The first eyeglasses were made by medieval monks who carved bits
of quartz into magnifying glasses, riveted them together and
perched them on their noses to magnify the tiny handwriting of
manuscripts, historians say.
</P>
<P>
   Gems had been used as magnifying glasses since ancient times,
and the Roman emperor Nero is said to have gazed through an emerald
ring to improve his view of gladiators in combat.
</P>
<P>
   But spectacles represented a technological breakthrough because
they freed the reader's hands.
</P>
<P>
   Because there was a lens for each eye, they provided stereotypic
or three-dimensional vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eyeglasses give you depth perception, double your field of
vision, and are less tiring than a magnifying glass,'' said Dr.
Norman Medow, director of pediatric ophthalmology at Manhattan Eye,
Ear and Throat Hospital and an amateur historian of eyeglasses.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Bacon, a scientist and Franciscan friar in England who was
twice imprisoned by his order for ``black magic,'' is often
credited with making the first eyeglasses. The first written
reference to spectacles is in his ``Opus majus,'' published in
1268.
</P>
<P>
   But many historians attribute the discovery to monks in northern
Italy. In Pisa, a Dominican monk, Alessandro della Spina, was
making reading glasses at the end of the 13th century. The Chinese
had spectacles in the 13th century as well, but they were used to
shade eyes from the sun rather than to aid vision.
</P>
<P>
   With the rise of the Venetian glass industry in the 14th
century, glass lenses began to replace quartz. The invention of the
printing press in the 1450s, the subsequent spread of books and the
rise of literacy increased the demand for reading glasses.
Eyeglasses were commonly sold on the streets in the 16th century,
and professional guilds developed to control quality.
</P>
<P>
   The original spectacles were only for the farsighted. In the
beginning of the 16th century, eyeglasses were developed for the
nearsighted as well. A 1517 portrait by Raphael depicts Pope Leo X
holding a magnifying glass.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping glasses on one's face was a trial. The pince nez (French
for ``pinches the nose'' was uncomfortable and unstable,
particularly for those engaged in active pursuits like making the
king laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Will Somers, Henry VII's court jester, had a suit of armor with
spectacles riveted to the helmet, Alberta Kelly wrote in her book
``Lenses, Spectacles, Eyeglasses and Contacts: The Story of Vision
Aids.''
</P>
<P>
   More conventional people attached lenses to their faces with
ribbons or strips of leather.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as you didn't sneeze, they would stay on your nose a
while,'' said John Handley, the curator of the American Academy of
Ophthalmology's museum of eyeglasses in San Francisco. ``They
weren't too comfortable, but if you didn't know any better,
ignorance is bliss.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not until 1728 that a London inventor, Edward Scarlett,
came up with a really good way to hold glasses on: temple pieces _
strips of metal attached to the lenses with hinges that at first
held the glasses at a 45-degree angle to the face.
</P>
<P>
   George Washington bought a pair of glasses with hinged temple
pieces for $75 _ a staggering sum in his day.
</P>
<P>
   The temple pieces were short when wigs were in fashion, because
it would hurt to put a tight wig on top of them. The pieces evolved
into wires long enough to hook over the ear when wigs went out of
style in the 19th century, Handley said.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Franklin is generally credited with the invention of
bifocals. But London eyeglass makers were experimenting with the
idea of fusing two lenses as early as 1760, according to Dr. Alvin
and Virginia B. Silverstein, authors of ``Glasses and Contact
Lenses: Your Guide to Eyes, Eyewear and Eye Care.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of contact lenses dates to 1508 when Leonardo da Vinci
submerged his face in a bowl of water and used the bowl as a
refracting surface, Kelly wrote. At the end of the 19th century,
the first contact lenses were made of glass and covered the whites
as well as the iris. They were uncomfortable and could not be worn
for more than a few hours.
</P>
<P>
   Plastic lenses were developed in the 1930s, and by 1939,
Hollywood movie makers were using contact lenses to change the
color of actors' eyes or to produce special effects like making
someone look like an alien.
</P>
<P>
   The prototype for corneal lenses, which cover only the center of
the eye, was first developed by the American lens technician Kevin
Tuohy in 1948. His lenses rode on a thin layer of tears, and were
more comfortable than the larger ones that covered the white.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1950s, a Czech chemist, Otto Wichterle, invented a
soft, water-absorbing plastic that seemed suitable for contacts. He
made the first soft contact lenses in 1961 using a phonograph motor
and a child's Erector set, according to the Encyclopaedia
Britannica.
</P>
<P>
   Soft lenses were put on the market in 1971, and disposable
lenses became available in 1987. About 31 million Americans wear
contact lenses, the Contact Lens Council, a trade group, reports.
</P>
<P>
   With the rise of vision-correcting eye surgery, ``Fewer people
in the future might use spectacles, but for sure their demise is
exaggerated,'' said Medow, the pediatric ophthalmologist at the
Manhattan hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will always be a need for spectacles,'' he added,
``either for residual correction after refractive surgery, or to
add to our designer wardrobes.''

   The news Monday that Vice President Al Gore would name an
Orthodox Jew, Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, as his running
mate adds to the growing evidence that a candidate's religion is of
diminishing importance in national politics and that religious
prejudice is in decline as a factor in elections and high
appointive office, particularly for Jewish candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But many Jews don't believe it, and they fear awakening latent
anti-Semitism should they become too politically powerful.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the all-but-nominated Democratic standardbearer, is
expected to announce his choice of Lieberman on Tuesday in
Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton named two Jewish jurists in succession to the
Supreme Court -- Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Steven Breyer --
without much more than routine notice.
</P>
<P>
   And increasingly, Jewish candidates across the country are being
elected to local and national office by non-Jewish voters.
America's 6 million Jews, about 2 percent of the nation's total
population, occupy 11 percent of the seats in the Senate. In the
House of Representatives, there are 23 Jewish members holding 5
percent of the seats.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish community leaders say it no longer much matters if a
candidate is Jewish. Jewish candidates win or lose, and are
nominated or passed over for nomination, but being Jewish is not
the reason when they are successful -- and it is not the reason
when they are unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   A Jewish Republican from Pennsylvania, Sen. Arlen Specter, made
an unsuccessful but serious bid for his party's 1996 presidential
nomination. Not all, but many, Jewish leaders believe it is now
reasonable to think a Jew could be elected president, assuming that
one was positioned to win the nomination of the Democratic or
Republican parties.
</P>
<P>
   All of that certainly could not have been said 30 or even 20
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But while many Jews take pride in the trend and believe it
should be celebrated, other Jews find the dramatic change
troubling. They worry that acceptance and success can never be
taken for granted, that a strain of anti-Semitism still lingers
below the surface of American society and could erupt if too much
attention is paid to too many Jews who become too prominent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, there some who are fearful of what non-Jews will say,
who are mindful of Jewish history and think it would be better for
Jews to be not seen and not heard, but that is a view of a
diminishing minority,'' said Jonathan Sarna, professor of American
Jewish History at Brandeis University,
</P>
<P>
   To Rep. Howard Berman, one of five Jewish members of the
California congressional delegation, such fears are a remnant of
the ``shtetl'' or ghetto mindset among a fearful ``old guard''
whose Angst-ridden doctrine warns, ``Do nothing to push the king,
or the mayor, or the governor.''
</P>
<P>
   But not entirely old guard.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Laszlo, a 30-something Washington-based pollster and
political consultant, who is Jewish, said she cannot feel
complacent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darwin said it is not the smartest or the strongest but those
best able to adapt who survive and adapt sometimes means keeping
your head down,'' Laszlo said.
</P>
<P>
   To Laszlo, history is the best guide. ``While there is no reason
to think there is any problem in America now, there was no reason
to worry in Austria where my father lived when they put a yellow
star on him,'' Laszlo said. ``We are the only community that, when
we fail to be accepted, it's not just a matter of being unable to
be in the country club, it's a matter of survival.''
</P>
<P>
   Laszlo admits her concerns are connected to her own experience
in 1994 when she failed to win the Democratic nomination for
Congress in a crowded primary in the Second District of North
Carolina, where she grew up. One competitor's tactic was to refer
to her as ``that Jew-girl from Durham,'' Laszlo recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Even if there were risk of igniting anti-Semitism, that should
not deter Jews from seeking public office, said Ira Forman,
executive director of the National Jewish Democratic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is always some kind of risk out front when you head
up,'' Forman said. ``Politics is about who gets what, when and how.
In America today, if you don't take the risk you're going to be
left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Forman is a Jew of the baby boom generation. ``I grew up in the
Midwest and I couldn't go to the country club two blocks from me,
but other than that I found relatively little discrimination,''
Forman said. ``I had two or three fights growing up when someone
called me a `damn Jew.' But my experience was not horrible. Yet you
can't say anti-Semitism doesn't exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Discussing his own unsuccessful campaign for the Republican
presidential nomination (which Bob Dole won), Specter said he did
not lose because he was Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of other factors,'' Specter said. ``It had a
lot more to do with my position on the political spectrum. I did
not appeal to Republican primary voters because I was too much of a
centrist.''
</P>
<P>
   But Specter insists that, if nominated, he would have had ``an
excellent chance'' of winning the presidency in the general
election.
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup poll of voters nationally in February of last year
found that 92 percent said they would be willing to vote for a
Jewish presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Specter challenges the notion that religion is
irrelevant to voters when the candidate is Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a latent adverse reaction to Jewish candidates
today,perhaps not as intense as it was in the past, but it's still
there. I don't know if it's a 5 percent factor or a 9 percent
factor or an 11 percent factor, but it's there.''
</P>
<P>
   And Specter is sympathetic to Jewish concerns about the number
of members of the Jewish community in high profile positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have too many Jews in office, it gives support to the
frequent contention that Jews control Wall Street, Hollywood,
television and the newspapers. Jews also worry that if a Jewish
officeholder screws up, the Jewish community will be blamed,''
Specter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not simple,'' Specter said. ``There's a tendency to say
that times have changed and you have minorities in all sorts of
positions, African-Americans and Hispanics. All that is true to an
extent, but you really wonder about how much tokenism there is and
how much bias and discrimination is close to the surface.''
</P>
<P>
   Others exude optimism. ``We've lived through Holocaust and
pogroms,'' said 84-year-old Hyman Bookbinder, a longtime lobbyist
on issues of concern to the Jewish community. ``We can't say the
battle is over, but the battle is substantially won.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in California, a state where both senators are Jewish,
many Jews still perceive anti-Semitism as a lurking threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a foreboding that Jews maintain that there may not be
a great deal of anti-Semitism now, but they don't want to admit
there might not be in future,'' said Earl Rabb, former director of
the Jewish Community relations Council in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   David Singer, who studies polling data for the American Jewish
Committee in New York, is struck by the gap between reality and the
Jewish perception of reality, between an increased willingness
among non-Jewish voters to vote for Jewish candidates, and the
disbelief among many Jews that this could be true.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend is greater and greater acceptance of Jewish
candidates,'' Singer said. ``It's perfectly clear that their
Jewishness is irrelevant. Yet among Jews, you would not believe the
amount of resistance you get to this. There's this strange mind
warp we're in. American Jews remain convinced that there is a lot
of anti-Semitism in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   It is another tragic legacy of the Holocaust, Singer said.
``It's this notion that `they hate us' and it doesn't matter how
much the situation changes.'' Singer calls it ``anticipatory
anti-Semitism -- a grim concern that things may be good at this
minute but who knows what's around the corner.''
</P>
<P>
   What's around the corner may be the first Jewish president,
according to Jason Isaacson, director of governmental affairs for
the American Jewish Committee in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``With each generation and each passing year, we are closer and
closer to the reality in which ethnicity ceases to matter in
American politics,'' Isaacson said.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``That is a source of pride for various groups'' and nothing
less than ``a revolution'' in American society for Jews like
Isaacson, who remembers ``the bad old days when corporate board
rooms had few if any Jews; when Jews, with a few exceptions, were
essentially fenced off from access from elite preserves of society,
the best clubs, jobs and appointments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't say all the old stereotypes and old prejudices have
completely vanished, but certainly at the elite levels of politics
and academia and business those old walls have crumbled,'' Isaacson
said. ``Achievement and experience are the indices and standards by
which potential candidates are for the most part being judged.''
</P>
<P>
   As examples, Jews have assumed the presidency at Ivy League
universities where rigid quotas on Jewish admissions were once in
place. Alan Greenspan heads the Federal Reserve Board. Sandy Berger
is the White House national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   There are clearly hate groups and strains of society that do not
accept Jews and remain intolerant of minorities generally. ``But
the overwhelming portion of the population is generally tolerant
and supportive of diversity,'' Isaacson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quotas have vanished and limits on any ethnic or religious
group are no longer applicable, or even thinkable,'' Isaacson said.
``And if this is a permanent fixture in American society, and I
hope it is, America has genuinely changed.''

   Rep. Benjamin A. Cardin, a seven-term Democrat from Maryland, is
not convinced that religion has become irrelevant in politics.
``That's a little strong,'' he said. ``But it is clearly less of a
factor today than it was a decade or two ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Concern about a candidate's religion has been declining since
John F. Kennedy, the first and still the only Catholic to win the
presidency, broke that barrier in 1960, Cardin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a more diverse and tolerant society today,'' Cardin
said. ``People have gotten to know each other a lot better.''
Cardin believes the political process has matured enough ``to
permit a person qualified to be president who is Jewish to be able
to win,'' even if many Jews don't believe it yet.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   ``No one thought a Catholic could be president,'' Cardin said.
``Or, now, a woman, or an African-American. That's a stereotype
that will be broken in our lifetime. We're beyond that. Of course,
until it happens, nobody from the community involved will believe
it can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be a little soon to expect a Jewish president, according
to Sarna, the Brandeis professor. ``I expect we'll have a woman
president before we have a Jewish president,'' Sarna said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it seems to me we'll have a Jewish president at some point
in time. I can never remember a time when so many of the candidates
talked about as potential vice presidential material are Jewish.
That seems to be a very interesting feature of the current
election. It remains to be seen if it's just talk or if something
will come of it.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Lieberman, former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
and Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California were on early lists of
potential choices for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some things about this year's presidential race are
causing head-shaking in the Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both major candidates are using the religion card,'' said Abe
Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai
B'rith. ``Whether it's George W. Bush saying that Jesus is his
political philosopher or Gore making decisions based on `what Jesus
would do,' that's a problem. They are very specific.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are talking about Christ and Christianity. They are
saying that's how they would govern. In an autobiography, that's
one thing. When you go to church, that's wonderful. But on the
political platform, it takes on a different meaning. It plays on
church-state relationships, prayer in school, abortion, school
vouchers; it plays on all issues and that's anxiety-producing. It
brings about a sense of alienation not only to Jews but others,
Muslims, Buddhists, atheists and other ethnic groups. Don't forget,
we are becoming an amalgam of all kinds of religions and ethnic
groups.''
</P>
<P>
   (THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the cultural acceptance of Jews has been accompanied by
the diversity phenomenon that some Jews find less comforting.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a certain fear in the Jewish community that even as
individual Jews have certainly risen up into elite circles that the
Jewish community itself is in some ways less significant in the
world of American religion,'' Sarna said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once upon a time we talked about Protestants, Catholics and
Jews. Jews were one of America's `big three' religions,'' Sarna
said. ``Now there's a sense that America is a smorgasbord of
religions, of many minority faiths of which the Jewish community is
just one.''
</P>
<P>
   The change, Sarna said, is visible on ceremonial occasions.
Where once the priest, minister or rabbi once stood, a broader
selection of religious leaders now rise to deliver the
benedictions.

   The news Monday that Vice President Al Gore would name an
Orthodox Jew, Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, as his running
mate adds to the growing evidence that a candidate's religion is of
diminishing importance in national politics and that religious
prejudice is in decline as a factor in elections and high
appointive office, particularly for Jewish candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But many Jews don't believe it, and they fear awakening latent
anti-Semitism should they become too politically powerful.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the all-but-nominated Democratic standardbearer, is
expected to announce his choice of Lieberman on Tuesday in
Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton named two Jewish jurists in succession to the
Supreme Court -- Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Steven Breyer --
without much more than routine notice.
</P>
<P>
   And increasingly, Jewish candidates across the country are being
elected to local and national office by non-Jewish voters.
America's 6 million Jews, about 2 percent of the nation's total
population, occupy 11 percent of the seats in the Senate. In the
House of Representatives, there are 23 Jewish members holding 5
percent of the seats.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish community leaders say it no longer much matters if a
candidate is Jewish. Jewish candidates win or lose, and are
nominated or passed over for nomination, but being Jewish is not
the reason when they are successful -- and it is not the reason
when they are unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   A Jewish Republican from Pennsylvania, Sen. Arlen Specter, made
an unsuccessful but serious bid for his party's 1996 presidential
nomination. Not all, but many, Jewish leaders believe it is now
reasonable to think a Jew could be elected president, assuming that
one was positioned to win the nomination of the Democratic or
Republican parties.
</P>
<P>
   All of that certainly could not have been said 30 or even 20
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But while many Jews take pride in the trend and believe it
should be celebrated, other Jews find the dramatic change
troubling. They worry that acceptance and success can never be
taken for granted, that a strain of anti-Semitism still lingers
below the surface of American society and could erupt if too much
attention is paid to too many Jews who become too prominent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, there some who are fearful of what non-Jews will say,
who are mindful of Jewish history and think it would be better for
Jews to be not seen and not heard, but that is a view of a
diminishing minority,'' said Jonathan Sarna, professor of American
Jewish History at Brandeis University,
</P>
<P>
   To Rep. Howard Berman, one of five Jewish members of the
California congressional delegation, such fears are a remnant of
the ``shtetl'' or ghetto mindset among a fearful ``old guard''
whose Angst-ridden doctrine warns, ``Do nothing to push the king,
or the mayor, or the governor.''
</P>
<P>
   But not entirely old guard.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Laszlo, a 30-something Washington-based pollster and
political consultant, who is Jewish, said she cannot feel
complacent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darwin said it is not the smartest or the strongest but those
best able to adapt who survive and adapt sometimes means keeping
your head down,'' Laszlo said.
</P>
<P>
   To Laszlo, history is the best guide. ``While there is no reason
to think there is any problem in America now, there was no reason
to worry in Austria where my father lived when they put a yellow
star on him,'' Laszlo said. ``We are the only community that, when
we fail to be accepted, it's not just a matter of being unable to
be in the country club, it's a matter of survival.''
</P>
<P>
   Laszlo admits her concerns are connected to her own experience
in 1994 when she failed to win the Democratic nomination for
Congress in a crowded primary in the Second District of North
Carolina, where she grew up. One competitor's tactic was to refer
to her as ``that Jew-girl from Durham,'' Laszlo recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Even if there were risk of igniting anti-Semitism, that should
not deter Jews from seeking public office, said Ira Forman,
executive director of the National Jewish Democratic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is always some kind of risk out front when you head
up,'' Forman said. ``Politics is about who gets what, when and how.
In America today, if you don't take the risk you're going to be
left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Forman is a Jew of the baby boom generation. ``I grew up in the
Midwest and I couldn't go to the country club two blocks from me,
but other than that I found relatively little discrimination,''
Forman said. ``I had two or three fights growing up when someone
called me a `damn Jew.' But my experience was not horrible. Yet you
can't say anti-Semitism doesn't exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Discussing his own unsuccessful campaign for the Republican
presidential nomination (which Bob Dole won), Specter said he did
not lose because he was Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of other factors,'' Specter said. ``It had a
lot more to do with my position on the political spectrum. I did
not appeal to Republican primary voters because I was too much of a
centrist.''
</P>
<P>
   But Specter insists that, if nominated, he would have had ``an
excellent chance'' of winning the presidency in the general
election.
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup poll of voters nationally in February of last year
found that 92 percent said they would be willing to vote for a
Jewish presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Specter challenges the notion that religion is
irrelevant to voters when the candidate is Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a latent adverse reaction to Jewish candidates
today,perhaps not as intense as it was in the past, but it's still
there. I don't know if it's a 5 percent factor or a 9 percent
factor or an 11 percent factor, but it's there.''
</P>
<P>
   And Specter is sympathetic to Jewish concerns about the number
of members of the Jewish community in high profile positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have too many Jews in office, it gives support to the
frequent contention that Jews control Wall Street, Hollywood,
television and the newspapers. Jews also worry that if a Jewish
officeholder screws up, the Jewish community will be blamed,''
Specter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not simple,'' Specter said. ``There's a tendency to say
that times have changed and you have minorities in all sorts of
positions, African-Americans and Hispanics. All that is true to an
extent, but you really wonder about how much tokenism there is and
how much bias and discrimination is close to the surface.''
</P>
<P>
   Others exude optimism. ``We've lived through Holocaust and
pogroms,'' said 84-year-old Hyman Bookbinder, a longtime lobbyist
on issues of concern to the Jewish community. ``We can't say the
battle is over, but the battle is substantially won.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in California, a state where both senators are Jewish,
many Jews still perceive anti-Semitism as a lurking threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a foreboding that Jews maintain that there may not be
a great deal of anti-Semitism now, but they don't want to admit
there might not be in future,'' said Earl Rabb, former director of
the Jewish Community relations Council in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   David Singer, who studies polling data for the American Jewish
Committee in New York, is struck by the gap between reality and the
Jewish perception of reality, between an increased willingness
among non-Jewish voters to vote for Jewish candidates, and the
disbelief among many Jews that this could be true.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend is greater and greater acceptance of Jewish
candidates,'' Singer said. ``It's perfectly clear that their
Jewishness is irrelevant. Yet among Jews, you would not believe the
amount of resistance you get to this. There's this strange mind
warp we're in. American Jews remain convinced that there is a lot
of anti-Semitism in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   It is another tragic legacy of the Holocaust, Singer said.
``It's this notion that `they hate us' and it doesn't matter how
much the situation changes.'' Singer calls it ``anticipatory
anti-Semitism -- a grim concern that things may be good at this
minute but who knows what's around the corner.''
</P>
<P>
   What's around the corner may be the first Jewish president,
according to Jason Isaacson, director of governmental affairs for
the American Jewish Committee in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``With each generation and each passing year, we are closer and
closer to the reality in which ethnicity ceases to matter in
American politics,'' Isaacson said.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   ``That is a source of pride for various groups'' and nothing
less than ``a revolution'' in American society for Jews like
Isaacson, who remembers ``the bad old days when corporate board
rooms had few if any Jews; when Jews, with a few exceptions, were
essentially fenced off from access from elite preserves of society,
the best clubs, jobs and appointments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't say all the old stereotypes and old prejudices have
completely vanished, but certainly at the elite levels of politics
and academia and business those old walls have crumbled,'' Isaacson
said. ``Achievement and experience are the indices and standards by

</P>
<P>
   As examples, Jews have assumed the presidency at Ivy League
universities where rigid quotas on Jewish admissions were once in
place. Alan Greenspan heads the Federal Reserve Board. Sandy Berger
is the White House national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   There are clearly hate groups and strains of society that do not
accept Jews and remain intolerant of minorities generally. ``But
the overwhelming portion of the population is generally tolerant
and supportive of diversity,'' Isaacson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quotas have vanished and limits on any ethnic or religious
group are no longer applicable, or even thinkable,'' Isaacson said.
``And if this is a permanent fixture in American society, and I
hope it is, America has genuinely changed.''

   Rep. Benjamin A. Cardin, a seven-term Democrat from Maryland, is
not convinced that religion has become irrelevant in politics.
``That's a little strong,'' he said. ``But it is clearly less of a
factor today than it was a decade or two ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Concern about a candidate's religion has been declining since
John F. Kennedy, the first and still the only Catholic to win the
presidency, broke that barrier in 1960, Cardin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a more diverse and tolerant society today,'' Cardin
said. ``People have gotten to know each other a lot better.''
Cardin believes the political process has matured enough ``to
permit a person qualified to be president who is Jewish to be able
to win,'' even if many Jews don't believe it yet.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   ``No one thought a Catholic could be president,'' Cardin said.
``Or, now, a woman, or an African-American. That's a stereotype
that will be broken in our lifetime. We're beyond that. Of course,
until it happens, nobody from the community involved will believe
it can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be a little soon to expect a Jewish president, according
to Sarna, the Brandeis professor. ``I expect we'll have a woman
president before we have a Jewish president,'' Sarna said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it seems to me we'll have a Jewish president at some point
in time. I can never remember a time when so many of the candidates
talked about as potential vice presidential material are Jewish.
That seems to be a very interesting feature of the current
election. It remains to be seen if it's just talk or if something
will come of it.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Lieberman, former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
and Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California were on early lists of
potential choices for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some things about this year's presidential race are
causing head-shaking in the Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both major candidates are using the religion card,'' said Abe
Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai
B'rith. ``Whether it's George W. Bush saying that Jesus is his
political philosopher or Gore making decisions based on `what Jesus
would do,' that's a problem. They are very specific.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are talking about Christ and Christianity. They are
saying that's how they would govern. In an autobiography, that's
one thing. When you go to church, that's wonderful. But on the
political platform, it takes on a different meaning. It plays on
church-state relationships, prayer in school, abortion, school
vouchers; it plays on all issues and that's anxiety-producing. It
brings about a sense of alienation not only to Jews but others,
Muslims, Buddhists, atheists and other ethnic groups. Don't forget,
we are becoming an amalgam of all kinds of religions and ethnic
groups.''

<P>

   ``No one thought a Catholic could be president,'' Cardin said.
``Or, now, a woman, or an African-American. That's a stereotype
that will be broken in our lifetime. We're beyond that. Of course,
until it happens, nobody from the community involved will believe
it can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be a little soon to expect a Jewish president, according
to Sarna, the Brandeis professor. ``I expect we'll have a woman
president before we have a Jewish president,'' Sarna said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it seems to me we'll have a Jewish president at some point
in time. I can never remember a time when so many of the candidates
talked about as potential vice presidential material are Jewish.
That seems to be a very interesting feature of the current
election. It remains to be seen if it's just talk or if something
will come of it.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Lieberman, former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
and Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California were on early lists of
potential choices for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some things about this year's presidential race are
causing head-shaking in the Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both major candidates are using the religion card,'' said Abe
Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai
B'rith. ``Whether it's George W. Bush saying that Jesus is his
political philosopher or Gore making decisions based on `what Jesus
would do,' that's a problem. They are very specific.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are talking about Christ and Christianity. They are
saying that's how they would govern. In an autobiography, that's
one thing. When you go to church, that's wonderful. But on the
political platform, it takes on a different meaning. It plays on
church-state relationships, prayer in school, abortion, school
vouchers; it plays on all issues and that's anxiety-producing. It
brings about a sense of alienation not only to Jews but others,
Muslims, Buddhists, atheists and other ethnic groups. Don't forget,
we are becoming an amalgam of all kinds of religions and ethnic
groups.''
</P>
<P>
   (THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the cultural acceptance of Jews has been accompanied by
the diversity phenomenon that some Jews find less comforting.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a certain fear in the Jewish community that even as
individual Jews have certainly risen up into elite circles that the
Jewish community itself is in some ways less significant in the
world of American religion,'' Sarna said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once upon a time we talked about Protestants, Catholics and
Jews. Jews were one of America's `big three' religions,'' Sarna
said. ``Now there's a sense that America is a smorgasbord of
religions, of many minority faiths of which the Jewish community is
just one.''
</P>
<P>
   The change, Sarna said, is visible on ceremonial occasions.
Where once the priest, minister or rabbi once stood, a broader
selection of religious leaders now rise to deliver the
benedictions.

<TEXT>

<P>
   Who hasn't heard the mantra: change or perish? It's a corporate
cliche by now. And like many cliches, it happens to be true. But
so, too, is its unhappy corollary: many companies change and
perish. Change is so disruptive it can tear organizations apart.
</P>
<P>
   To change successfully, companies should stop changing all the
time. Instead, they should intersperse major initiatives among
carefully paced periods of smaller, organic change. By doing so,
overall change can be managed with an approach called dynamic
stability.
</P>
<P>
   Achieving dynamic stability is more difficult than ramming big,
hairy, audacious changes through an organization, in much the same
way that it is more difficult to end a war with negotiations than
with an atomic bomb.
</P>
<P>
   But dynamic stability has the great advantage of leaving
survivors. It allows change without fatal pain.
</P>
<P>
   Change, as it is usually orchestrated, creates initiative
overload and organizational chaos, both of which provoke strong
resistance from the people most affected.
</P>
<P>
   Dramatic change programs _ programs that have been all the rage
since the 1970s _ typically involve drastic measures as CEOs seek
to maximize growth or economic value as quickly as possible. In
dynamic stability, though, the goal is change that can be sustained
over both the short and long term.
</P>
<P>
   In its drive to become a global competitor, Finley, Kumble,
Wagner, Heine, Underberg, Manley, Myerson &AMP; Casey, a law firm based
in New York City, speedily added partners and associates throughout
the 1980s. But the firm's pace wasn't sustainable. Finley Kumble
collapsed in 1988 amid huge debts, vicious infighting and many
legal improprieties.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric, by contrast, wanted rapid change, but it also
knew when to slow down. Throughout the 1980s GE engaged in creative
_ most people would say brutal _ destruction involving massive
layoffs, restructuring and divestitures. But GE's changes in the
1990s were far less disruptive.
</P>
<P>
   GE's acquisitions in the last decade _ companies such as
Employers Reinsurance and Kidder, Peabody _ have tended to be in
areas like financial services where GE had already carved out
niches. They were thus less disruptive to the organization. By
alternating radical change with more organic modifications, Jack
Welch carefully buttressed the organization's stability, thereby
making major changes more feasible. That's dynamic stability.
</P>
<P>
   At its essence, dynamic stability is a process of continual but
relatively small change efforts that involve existing practices and
business models rather than new ones. Besides ``tinkering'' and
``kludging,'' which differ from each other mainly in scale, dynamic
stability requires that the pace of big and small changes must be
implemented at the right intervals.
</P>
<P>
   We all know a Mr. Fixit, someone who is always making things
from odd nuts and bolts. Similarly, some of the greatest change
masters _ companies such as 3M and Hewlett-Packard _ are
world-class tinkerers. They go into the corporate basement, so to
speak, where they rapidly pull together inspired solutions to
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Chemical, for example, developed Saran Wrap for an
industrial-coating application. With a little tinkering _ and a lot
of expertise in marketing and branded consumer products _ Dow
successfully aimed the product at consumers, an entirely different
market.
</P>
<P>
   Tinkering, of course, does not guarantee successful change. But
it is less costly, less destabilizing, and quicker than creative
destruction and invention.
</P>
<P>
   Kludging is tinkering, but with a college education. It takes
place on a larger scale and involves many more parts. Some parts
can come from outside a company's existing portfolio as in mergers
and acquisitions, but usually the components of a kludge are assets
lying around an organization's backyard, such as particular skill
functions or standard technologies or models.
</P>
<P>
   Because they are so large, kludges can result in the creation of
a division or an entire business. Consider the case of GKN, a
British industrial conglomerate. Starting in the early 1980s, the
organization would often land contracts and then find engineers to
staff the projects. But sometimes contracts would get postponed or
canceled, leaving engineers idle.
</P>
<P>
   To deal with this recurrent situation, GKN's units began to rent
out their idle engineers for short assignments elsewhere, pulling
them back into the organization as needed. The units started the
practice on an informal basis, but it proved so successful that GKN
created a new company, CEDU, to manage hiring out its own engineers
_ and those of other companies _ on short-term contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The change in the status quo has been almost painless. The
business model had been known in the organization for years. To
make more money from it, all GKN had to do was formalize the
practice in a new company.
</P>
<P>
   Most proponents of change management argue that you have to
change as much as you can as quickly as you can to stay ahead of
the competition. That advice is not so much wrong as
overgeneralized.
</P>
<P>
   Like individuals, organizations have different needs for change.
Those that have consistently avoided change may need to undergo
rapid, destructive change. Companies that already have been
changing rapidly face a different challenge _ they must learn to
shift down from highly destabilizing, disruptive change to
tinkering and kludging.
</P>
<P>
   One business leader who understands the value of pacing is Lou
Gerstner. At IBM and, before that, at American Express Travel
Related Services and RJR Nabisco, his initial impact was pure
creative destruction.
</P>
<P>
   In his first nine months at Travel Related Services, for
example, Gerstner began a major reorganization of the card and
traveler's check businesses, accompanied by a widespread shift of
managers across those units. A rash of new product introductions
followed quickly. The nine-month transformation was, in Gerstner's
words, like ``breaking the four-minute mile.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gerstner had a genius for knowing when it was time to rest.
He was alert to early signs of change fatigue: cynicism and
burnout. He recognized that the success of his overall change
campaign depended on the stability of the units involved, and he
was very thoughtful about how and when to intersperse the small
changes among the big.
</P>
<P>
   At Travel Related Services, no new products were launched and no
new executives were brought in from outside for 18 months after
Gerstner's initial blitz. But he tinkered constantly to prevent the
company from drifting into inertia; he played with the structure,
with the compensation system, with product offerings.
</P>
<P>
   The unthreatening nature of the interim changes allowed the
company to better absorb a second wave of product introductions and
restructurings when it arrived.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL SIDEBAR)
</P>
<P>
   FOUR OPERATING GUIDELINES
</P>
<P>
   Like many managerial practices, dynamic stability is as much art
as science. But companies that successfully tinker and kludge use
these four operating guidelines:
</P>
<P>
   REWARD SHAMELESS BORROWING: The first rule of dynamic stability
is that companies must be willing to noodle with what already
exists _ and invent from scratch only as a last resort.
</P>
<P>
   APPOINT A CHIEF MEMORY OFFICER: Only by remembering the past as
we tinker and kludge can we avoid making the same old mistakes _
and take advantage of valuable opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   TINKER AND KLUDGE INTERNALLY FIRST: Dynamic stability is much
easier to manage if you stay inside the organization. Just as the
body is more likely to reject a foreign organ than its own, an
organization has greater difficulty reconfiguring imported parts.
</P>
<P>
   HIRE GENERALISTS: A company dedicated to dynamic stability needs
generalists. Generalists are often derided as jacks-of-all-trades
and masters of none. But their range of skills lets them combine
disparate ideas, techniques, processes and cultures. In other
words, they can tinker and kludge. What's more, generalists are
typically more open-minded and less biased than specialists are.

 c.2000 Harvard Business School Publishing  
<TEXT>

<P>
   The vast Chinese market has always attracted foreign companies,
but very few have been able to capitalize on the opportunities the
country affords. That failure can be attributed in large part to
the traditional investment vehicles available to foreign companies,
all of which create complexities and conflicts that hamstring
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Now, one company, Eastman Kodak, is pioneering a new corporate
structure in China _ one that looks very similar to Western
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   To understand the uniqueness of Kodak's approach, consider how
most foreign companies operate in China. The most common corporate
structure is the joint venture, in which companies share day-to-day
operational control with a local partner. But doing so can paralyze
decision making, a fatal flaw in today's rapidly changing markets.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent, for example, has seen its share of the market for
optical-fiber transmission equipment in China slide from 70 percent
to 30 percent because it must negotiate each technological change
in a product with a local partner.
</P>
<P>
   The involvement of local partners also exacerbates the effect of
China's narrow business licenses. Because Chinese regulations
restrict companies' geographic reach as well as the range of goods
they can manufacture and distribute, realizing economies of scale
and scope is difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Unilever, for example, recently had six joint ventures in
Shanghai making soap, ice cream, skin cream and laundry detergent.
Theoretically, a foreign company could consolidate the distribution
of its various joint-venture products, but it would have to get
consent from all its Chinese partners. That seldom happens, because
the partners fear that the products from their individual joint
ventures would end up at a disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid such complicated management issues, some companies have
established wholly owned foreign enterprises, so-called WOFEs, but
they, too, have limitations, among them difficulty winning
contracts and forging local alliances. China's local governments
have routinely favored state-owned enterprises over foreign
ventures, especially since 1999, when the industrial ministries in
Beijing were abolished.
</P>
<P>
   There is a better way for companies to compete in China. Since
1994, businesses have been able to register as joint-stock
companies _ a familiar corporate structure in the West. All of
China's state-owned enterprises listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen
stock exchanges have adopted this structure. But so far, only one
foreign multinational has taken this route: Eastman Kodak.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak's joint-stock companies, which I call foreign investor
shareholding corporations, or FISCs, have allowed the company to
achieve a high degree of operational control. The FISCs eliminate
the trade-off between management control and market access by
granting local partners minority stakes in return for their
business assets, such as factories and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Because local partners lose direct ownership of those assets,
they can be excluded from the day-to-day management. But as part
owners, they remain interested in helping the FISCs perform, which
motivates them to help the venture secure access to the markets.
</P>
<P>
   The FISC structure also mitigates the economic impact of narrow
business licenses. For example, Kodak doesn't have to get its local
partners' consent to consolidate distribution of products from its
different operations.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Kodak has created two FISCs: Kodak (China), in which it
holds an 80 percent share, and Kodak (Wuxi), in which it holds a 70
percent share.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak (China) purchased the assets of two domestic photofilm
manufacturers, Xiamen Fuda and Shantou Era, in return for 10
percent stakes and the right to appoint one board member each;
Kodak named the remaining eight directors. Because there must be at
least five shareholders, the Guangdong and Fujian international
trust and investment corporations also took nominal stakes in Kodak
(China). For its part, Kodak put up $380 million in cash. Kodak
(Wuxi) worked out a similar arrangement with different
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear why the shareholding structure works for Kodak. But
it's important to realize that it works for China as well. It gives
Chinese authorities a face-saving way to allow industrial reform
through the back door.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the photo industry had been almost entirely closed
off to foreign corporations because the government wanted to
develop a domestic photofilm industry. Foreign companies such as
Kodak were restricted to licensing agreements or direct imports,
which attracted heavy duties. But domestic manufacturers could not
keep up with the industry's rapid technological innovations, and
all but one were technically bankrupt by the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak's proposal to create FISCs was therefore considered a good
solution by Beijing authorities. No less than five central
government organizations, including three ministries, cooperated
with Kodak.
</P>
<P>
   China's State Development Planning Commission, which had been
involved in creating Kodak's FISCs, last year released a research
report supporting the ``Kodak model.'' And, in theory, the
regulatory framework already lets foreign corporations convert
existing joint ventures and WOFEs into FISCs, provided they have
been profitable for three years.
</P>
<P>
   If foreign corporations move in this direction on their own, it
will save Chinese authorities from having to embark on a wholesale
restructuring of the legal infrastructure of business.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the FISCs are well placed to obtain quick listings
on the Shenzhen and Shanghai stock exchanges, making it easier for
them to raise new capital. For all these reasons, many companies
will probably follow Kodak's lead.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The quick fix of laser surgery may be freeing more people from
eyeglasses and contact lenses, but no matter how successful the
surgery, their liberation is only temporary. Sooner or later the
need for reading glasses descends on all adults _ and from those
devices there is still no quick escape.
</P>
<P>
   Human bodies age at enormously different rates with one single
exception: the fine-focus mechanism of the human eye. The lens of
the eye and the muscle that surrounds it tick away the passage of
time like tiny atomic clocks, slowly deteriorating with a precision
so immutable that ophthalmologists say they can accurately estimate
patients' ages to within a few years by measuring their ability to
focus close up.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of close-up focus is known as presbyopia, from the
Greek for ``elderly vision,'' but the process actually begins in
very young adulthood. Children with normal vision can focus on
objects an inch or so from their eyes, but they lose that ability
as teen-agers, and by the age of 50 or so, when the eyes can focus
no closer than a yard or two away, almost all adults in the world
need glasses to read newspapers or thread needles.
</P>
<P>
   Those who claim they do not, researchers say, are simply
unusually skilled at ``blur interpretation,'' fooled by good
guesswork into thinking they are exceptions to a universal
biological rule.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Presbyopia is thought to represent not so much a sign of
approaching decrepitude as a leftover feature of primate life, when
scanning for food or predators on the horizon was a more important
survival task for adults than was any close-up work.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, for such a longstanding and uniform feature of human
biology, scientists are still not sure exactly what causes
presbyopia or what might reverse it.
</P>
<P>
   For the last five years, they have been arguing heatedly over
the risks and the merits of an experimental surgical procedure,
scleral expansion surgery, that, despite a host of scientific
objections, appears to fix it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely difficult to study the internal structures of
the eye,'' said Dr. Adrian Glasser, an expert in the physiology of
the eye at the University of Houston College of Optometry in Texas.
``It's such a finely regulated organ that many of the technologies
that have been available to study it have in one way or other
disrupted the very thing we're trying to study.''
</P>
<P>
   Dissections of human specimens have provided only partial
snapshots of the focusing process, while animal research is of
limited help because few animals focus the way humans do.
</P>
<P>
   The lens of the eye is suspended in the eyeball right behind the
iris, connected by a halo of fibers to a ring of circular muscle.
The lens, the fibers and the muscle itself all show changes with
the passing years, but exactly which of these changes drives the
loss of focusing ability is disputed.
</P>
<P>
   The lens is the best-studied part of the system. A
protein-filled disk, it derives from the same type of cells as do
the skin and the hair and, like them, continues to grow throughout
life. Unlike other continuously growing structures, though, the
lens cannot shed its older cells, or blindness would result.
Instead, it slowly gets bigger and thicker, bulging forward into
the fluid-filled space that separates it from the iris.
</P>
<P>
   According to the principles of optics, the bulging curvature
should make the lens focus better and better with advancing years.
The fact that exactly the opposite occurs means that other powerful
factors are operating too, and the clue to presbyopia lies with
them.
</P>
<P>
   Many scientists think that the most important factors are the
age-related changes that take place within the lens proteins,
making the lens harder and less elastic with the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proteins in the lens of an adult are decades old,'' said
Dr. Jane F. Koretz, a professor of biophysics at Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y. ``They are even older than we
are, because the first ones were laid down before we were born. In
no other part of the body is that the case. Everything else gets
replaced.''
</P>
<P>
   The protein molecules in the aging lens slowly change in ways
that make them bend light less, Koretz said. Although the elderly
lens is more spherical, it is less and less able to focus light
from nearby objects.
</P>
<P>
   Age-related changes also take place in the muscles surrounding
the lens. Most scientists agree that these muscles do not become
weak with age _ it would make no sense for one isolated muscle in
the body to slowly give out while all the others continue to work
perfectly well. A recent study using high-resolution magnetic
resonance to photograph the eye muscles confirmed that the muscles
still contracted powerfully in older people who could not focus up
close.
</P>
<P>
   The geometry of the fibers connecting the muscle to the lens
shifts as the lens grows with age, and the fibers themselves appear
to harden and become less elastic, a process that also interferes
with the ability to focus.
</P>
<P>
   Exercises purporting to ``strengthen'' the lens muscles are
purposeless, Koretz said, since the muscles are already strong: it
is their position and fibrous attachments that may hamper their
ability to move.
</P>
<P>
   If not exercise, then, can any measures help the owner of two
aging eyes elude reading glasses?
</P>
<P>
   Some people find that a satisfactory solution is the creation of
``monovision,'' in which one eye is manipulated to focus well at
reading distances (usually with a contact lens or an intraocular
lens placed after cataract surgery), while the other focuses for
distance. People instinctively grow to favor one eye or the other
for different tasks. While some people are delighted with this
solution, Koretz said, others are plagued by dizziness or nausea,
or miss the depth of vision they once had.
</P>
<P>
   Finding a better fix for presbyopia is rapidly becoming the Holy
Grail of experimental ophthalmology, especially as researchers and
entrepreneurs begin to calculate the profits that might accrue from
curing an annoyance affecting every single adult in the population.
</P>
<P>
   The basic disagreements as to why the process occurs have meant
that viable solutions are slow to emerge, and are extremely
controversial when they do.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most disputed to date is scleral expansion surgery, a
procedure devised by Dr. Ronald Schachar, a Texas ophthalmologist
and physicist, in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   A maverick who has argued that much of what scientists think
they know about the focusing mechanism of the eye is actually
untrue, Schachar holds that presbyopia develops only because, as
the lens of the eye swells with age, the muscles and fibers
surrounding it grow lax, and the system can no longer work
effectively.
</P>
<P>
   By stretching the system out again, Schachar says, presbyopia
can be easily and permanently reversed. He claims to restore
tension to the muscle and fibers by surgically implanting four
small curved pieces of plastic in the white of the eye a few
millimeters from the iris, which, he says, re-establish an
effective working distance between the lens muscles and the lens.
</P>
<P>
   His technique has evoked howls of protest from physiologists who
point out that it ignores decades of solid experimental evidence
implicating age-related changes within the lens itself as key
causes of presbyopia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scientific community never took scleral expansion surgery
seriously,'' Glasser said.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   A few hundred patients who have volunteered for the surgery over
the last decade in Mexico, Canada and Europe have stymied the
procedure's critics with reports that the surgery does seem to
restore their ability to see up close.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the Food and Drug Administration approved preliminary
trials of the operation at six sites in the United States,
including the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary in Manhattan, where
Dr. Barrie D. Soloway, co-medical director for vision correction,
will head the studies. Dr. Stephan D. Plager, 60, an
ophthalmologist in Santa Cruz, Calif., is also among the
investigators who are to take part in the evaluation of surgical
expansion surgery. In early May, Plager himself became a patient,
undergoing the procedure in both eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, he said, he was performing cataract surgery, and
10 days later, vision still a little blurry but ``getting clearer
every day,'' he read passages from his local newspaper over the
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how excited I am,'' he said. ``I haven't seen
this well since I was 35.''
</P>
<P>
   Familiar with all the reasons that his surgery should not work,
Plager said only that while the theory behind the procedure might
be flawed, the end result was hard to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proof that it works will ultimately be in the scientific
studies,'' he said, ``but the proof as far as I'm concerned is
already on the table. I'm not so courageous _ I'm more of a
pragmatist than courageous. I just wanted to get rid of the
glasses.'' &QL;

   WHICH COLLEGE? EARLY DECISION OPTIONS AND THE CAMPUS TOUR
</P>
<P>
   COLLEGE-OPTIONS-LIFEBEAT _ From a high school senior's
perspective, the advantages of applying to college ahead of the
pack are tempting: not only do you receive a speedy ``yea'' or
``nay,'' but your odds of being accepted increase markedly.
However, this tactic can limit a student's scholarship
opportunities. Also, some students simply need more time to look
around. If possible, students should schedule campus tours and
interviews at the colleges that interest them. By Kristen Carr.

   MIDDLE EASTERN FILMMAKERS FASCINATE THE WEST
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-FILM-LIFEBEAT _ Today, with intermittent peace talks and
slightly relaxed borders, the Middle East seems hesitantly
welcoming yet still esoteric enough to provoke fascination in the
West. Filmmakers and video artists from Iran and elsewhere in the
Middle East have found that repression and even war inspire
passionate, provocative works of art. By Brad Gooch.

   GARDENS-HYDRANGEAS-LIFEBEAT _ Hydrangeas are among those species
for which the word ``remarkable'' can be used without exaggeration.
How many plant families can trace their history back 70 million
years, are native to three continents, contain members that are
bushes, trees and vines, are both deciduous and evergreen and have
flowers that can completely change color from year to year or
season to season? There's a hydrangea for any garden, from clay
pots to meticulously cultivated acres. By Michael Weishan.

aggressive form of breast cancer. She and her husband wrestled with
the decision of whether to abort the pregnancy and decided to go
ahead. Their healthy child is now five years old, but the cancer

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Iranian video artist Shirin Neshat lives a long way from the
land of the chador, in a Chinatown loft in Manhattan, across from a
row of sweatshops. She dresses all in black and keeps her long dark
hair drawn severely back; she could pass for a SoHo art-world
character, circa 1978. Last February, Neshat returned from
Marrakech, where she had marshaled more than 200 people to film
``Fervor,'' a riveting tale of a man and woman who have an unspoken
epiphany while a mullah rants against sexual desire. It's an
11-minute immersion in the communal ecstasy of hidden Iranian
sensuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Iran, a man isn't allowed to make eye contact with a
woman,'' Neshat explains, sitting at a wooden table decorated only
with a vase of apricot-colored roses. ``But occasionally, when it
does happen, you get chills all over your body. Repression
heightens sexuality. My film is not so much a political analysis _
rather, it's romantic.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, with intermittent peace talks and slightly relaxed
borders, the Middle East seems hesitantly welcoming yet still
esoteric enough to provoke fascination in the West. More than a
century ago, the American painter Frederic Church built Olana, his
lavish Moorish-style home on the Hudson, where it is said he
enjoyed lounging in the robes of an Arab sheikh. Eventually, the
public swooned over belly dancers, camels and palm trees while
puffing on Fatima cigarettes. Irving Berlin wrote ``In My Harem,''
Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney wore tunics and harem pants and
moviegoers poured into theaters to watch Valentino vamp in ``The
Sheik''.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, it's artists in particular who are fascinated by the
Middle East. Filmmakers, video artists, painters, and writers from
Iran, Egypt, and Lebanon are being talked about for the first time
in years in the West. And American and European artists, in turn,
are showing signs of a new orientalism in their work and travel.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most prominent of the Middle Eastern artists
working today, Neshat gained notoriety for her early
black-and-white photographs in which she posed in a chador, a rifle
propped between her bare feet, her skin tattooed with calligraphic
lines by female Farsi poets.
</P>
<P>
   The images are opaque, offering few clues as to how a Westerner
should respond. Neshat's work has since evolved to more ambitious
double-screen films that are projected in simultaneous loops on
facing gallery walls as high as 12 feet, requiring audiences to
shift their gaze from, say, an image of a woman at a mosque in
Istanbul to a scene of white-robed worshipers in an American
church. Art critic Peter Schjeldahl, one of Neshat's many admirers,
has written that her meditations on chador culture ``emit an icy
heat of suppressed passions; they are among the first undoubtable
masterpieces of video installation.''
</P>
<P>
   While Neshat, who emigrated to America in the '70s, uses the
artistic freedom of the West as a foil for the regime back home,
filmmaker Abbas Kiarostami works within the system of Iranian
censorship.
</P>
<P>
   Regularly compared to neorealist masters Vittorio de Sica and
Satyajit Ray, Kiarostami has extracted uncanny performances from
young amateur actors and for more than 20 years has outfoxed the
mullahs by concealing political messages in ordinary dramas.
</P>
<P>
   In his film ``The Wind Will Carry Us'', which opens this month,
the protagonist is forever driving to a cemetery _ the only place
he can get reception for his mobile phone. Leading Iranian film
critic Jamsheed Akrami says, ``Before the revolution, Iranian
movies were banal Hollywood knockoffs. Afterward, deprived of
romantic formulas, directors were forced to be inventive. Now the
art films have turned into the dominant cinema. We may well be
witnessing a film renaissance from the East.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-six-year-old filmmaker Ziad Doueiri, like Neshat, tackles
theo-politics from the safety of the West. Doueiri has lived in
L.A. since 1984 and has worked as a regular cameraman for Quentin
Tarantino. Doueiri's film ``West Beirut,'' is a memoir of his
misadventures as a teenager during Lebanon's devastating civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Banned in Syria, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, ``West Beirut''
won the Francois Chalais Prize at Cannes in 1998 and debuted in the
States at the New Directors Film Festival last year.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, the protagonist maneuvers through a war zone in an
attempt to get his Super 8 film developed, only to wind up in a
Lebanese brothel, waving his Christian girlfriend's bra to the
snipers as a flag of truce. It brings to mind the lyricism of
adolescence as epitomized by Franois Truffaut's ``The 400 Blows''.
``My high school in Beirut was French,'' Doueiri explains. ``We had
to watch a French movie twice a week and write about it.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, Doueiri is navigating the same schizoid psyche as
Neshat, professionally and artistically. ``I was seeing a girl in
Paris, and she said, joking, 'I'm only going out with you because
it's hip to go out with an Arab these days.' In France, being a
'Ber,' meaning an Arab, is the cool thing.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Syrians and Israelis met in January to strike a peace
deal, says Doueiri, ``I thought, That's it; there's going to be
peace, and I'm making films about war. Then a friend from Paris
called and said, 'Don't worry. It will break down.' And two days
later, the negotiations did. And I said, 'Good!'''
</P>
<P>
   The comic and not-so-comic repercussions of being caught in a
cultural crossfire have also sparked the work of first-time
novelist Salar Abdoh, 35, as seen in his literary thriller, ``The
Poet Game'' (Picador). Abdoh fled Iran with his father and brothers
following the revolution in 1979, earning a master's degree in
English literature at the City College of New York and working as
the night manager at the Iroquois Hotel in midtown Manhattan, where
he wrote most of his noirish novel.
</P>
<P>
   Like a ventriloquist manipulating the stylish thrillers of
Graham Greene or John Le Carre, Abdoh tells the brilliant, dark
tale of a young man working for Iranian intelligence whose mission
impossible is to stop a New Year's Eve bombing in Manhattan planned
by a Hezbollah-style group of terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Abdoh relies on current media as the very wallpaper of his
imaginative world. ``The main female character is an
Italian-American who works with an Algerian terrorist cell called
the GIA,'' says Abdoh. ``So imagine my surprise a few months ago
when I read about this woman of Italian background caught at the
Canadian border who (allegedly) worked with the same Algerian
terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Abdoh read from his novel at the Temple Bar in
downtown Manhattan. Neshat was among the predominantly Middle
Eastern audience crowded into the smoky lounge. Abdoh, tall and
wearing spectacles reminiscent of James Joyce's, was asked how he
got material for his novel. ``I read the same newspapers as
everyone else,'' Abdoh replied, somewhat disappointing those in the
audience who thought he must have been privy to secret information.
</P>
<P>
   Artists were once described by poet Ezra Pound as ``the antennae
of the race.'' Philip Taaffe, the American painter whose canvases
have been infused with a certifiable Middle Eastern aesthetic,
might seem the likely successor to Delacroix in his trekking
through Egypt, Syria, Tunisia, and Morocco. But, unlike work of the
orientalists of the 19th century, Taaffe's version is more about
collaboration than colonialism. ``I wanted to embody a culture,
rather than impose myself on it. I didn't just want something to
refer to, to (symbolize) the exotic.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the artists in exile from the Middle East are driven by
nostalgia and curiosity to either return or discover untouched
vistas. The draw for filmmaker Doueiri remains his hometown of
Beirut, which he last visited two years ago. ``When it's not being
bombed, it's such a fun place,'' he says, laughing. ``The bars you
go to are the fanciest you've ever seen, like the Sunset Room in
Hollywood or the Pink in Santa Monica. There's even a gay scene at
BO18. Imagine, a thriving gay scene in the Middle East!''
</P>
<P>
   When artist Y.Z. Kami travels from his home in New York to his
native Iran, which he left in 1973, he seems as much a tourist as
his peers from America. Recently, he traveled to the ancient ruins
of Persepolis, the palace of the king of Persia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was all by myself,'' he says. ``There was this huge castle
and desert all around me. That could not happen anywhere else.
There would be 10,000 tourist cars.''
</P>
<P>
   He hopes to travel to Syria, where the medieval bazaars, or
souks, in Damascus and Aleppo are reportedly still intact. ``We
must hurry up and get there very soon, before they sign the peace
agreement with Israel,'' he says, his comment decidedly un-P.C.,
almost, well, orientalist. ``After that, everybody will be doing
the same thing, the tourists from everywhere.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   From a high school senior's perspective, the advantages of
applying to college ahead of the pack are tempting: not only do you
receive a speedy ``yea'' or ``nay,'' but your odds of being
accepted increase markedly. Harvard, for example, admits 26 percent
of its early- decision applicants, versus only 6 percent of those
who apply under the usual deadlines; Stanford, 24 percent versus 14
percent. It's no wonder that more and more students are opting for
early decision.
</P>
<P>
   Its exact terminology is well known to high school students, but
it may not be to their parents. Through ``early decision I:'
seniors apply to a college by November 15; if accepted, they must
commit to that school and withdraw all other applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early decision II'' is no different except that the deadline
is extended to January 15, giving students a few more months to
decide whether to go this route. (Students applying for I or II
typically receive a reply within a month of submitting their
applications.) Under ``early action,'' students will receive word
they've been accepted as early as December 15 but do not have to
commit to the school until May 1. (Applicants for regular admission
generally hear back from colleges in April.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Early decision is great for a student who's mature enough to
distinguish among various colleges, who is sure about his first
choice and who has a better than reasonable chance of getting in,''
says Stephen Singer, director of college counseling at Horace Mann
School in Riverdale, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not a simple antidote to all the anxieties that attend
getting into college. ``If you're not in the school's ballpark,
academically speaking, you're risking rejection,'' says Leonard
King, director of college counseling at the Maret School in
Washington, D.C. ``Waiting to apply later, when your latest scores
from standardized tests and your first-semester grades are
available, may help you get in.'' Provided, of course, those scores
and grades add up to a stronger academic standing.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that ``the more competitive the school, the less of
an advantage early decision presents,'' adds King. That's because
early decision often attracts the brightest, most motivated
students to begin with _ not to mention the fact that top schools
can well afford to be choosy. A rejection or deferral means that
students will have to start the entire process over again, this
time with a wounded ego _ and greater time constraints as they
scramble for an alternate school.
</P>
<P>
   Early decision can also limit a student's scholarship
opportunities. Once a school has locked in an applicant, there's no
more incentive for it to continue the wooing game. But not all the
benefits of bypassing early decision can be measured in monetary
terms: for many students, having the time to make the right
decision could yield the biggest payoff of all.
</P>
<P>
   TAKING THE TOUR
</P>
<P>
   With the college-selection process intensifying every step of
the way, it's no surprise that students and parents approach the
on-campus tour with SAT-level seriousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers of people making the tours have absolutely
mushroomed,'' says Singer. Amid the increasing frenzy, how do you
get the most out of this family ritual? Here are some tips to help
you make the college tour a real education.
</P>
<P>
   CONSIDER THE TIMING ``There should be an evolution in the way
you visit a school,'' says Singer. ``During the junior year, visit
schools so you can form some general impressions. The visits you
make in April or May of the senior year, when the student is
narrowing his choices, are the most important ones, because that's
when he's the closest, emotionally, to being an actual college
student. One's focus and priorities can change from junior to
senior year.''
</P>
<P>
   PHONE FIRST Alert a college admissions counselor of your arrival
date about a month in advance of any visit. That should allow
plenty of time to arrange for accommodations at a nearby inn and
set up interviews, meetings with professors and opportunities to
sit in on classes. Don't forget the schools' Web sites: most have
sections devoted to prospective students and offer the goods on
aspects of campus life _ academic or otherwise _ that students
might want to learn more about on a visit.
</P>
<P>
   BE SURE THEY'RE HOME Book your tours at the start of a semester,
so you're not there during spring break or final exams.
</P>
<P>
   AVOID THREE-DAY WEEKENDS Chances are many others will have had
the same idea. Check with admissions counselors to see which tours
have the most spots open.
</P>
<P>
   PRESS FOR AN INTERVIEW An interview provides the student with
the perfect chance to gather specific information. (Write questions
out in advance to save time.) It may not be as integral to the
admissions process as it was in the past, but it can't hurt to
schedule one. And why not help the admissions office match a face
with an application?
</P>
<P>
   DON'T OVERBOOK Allow at least half a day per stop and try not to
visit more than four colleges in a single trip. ``More than that,
and they're likely to just blur together,'' says Anne Ferguson, a
college counselor at the Hathaway Brown School in Shaker Heights,
Ohio. Taking notes can help keep each college's pros and cons
disdnct when it comes down to decision time.
</P>
<P>
   BREAK THE ROUTINE Visit coffeehouses and other student hangouts
to chat up the locals _ they might offer perspectives you won't get
from brochures or tour guides.
</P>
<P>
   GO SOLO Arrange for your child to visit on her own once she's
narrowed down her choices. Says tour veteran Libby Beckenbaugh,
mother of a sophomore at SMU: ``High school kids can get a much
better feel for the college if they're spending the weekend there
alone.'' Many admissions offices will happily arrange a stay in the
dorms with a volunteer host.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Like many women of my generation, I waited to have a baby,
thinking I would be better prepared for parenthood emotionally and
financially. I was 38 in 1994 when I finally got pregnant _
particularly coveted after two years of wandering through the
fertility maze.
</P>
<P>
   But there was another price to pay for waiting. Three weeks
after learning the jubilant news of my pregnancy, my husband, Mark,
and I sat in a surgeon's office as he told us that a lump I had
found in my breast was malignant.
</P>
<P>
   My cancer was aggressive. The surgeon told us I had only a 25
percent to 30 percent chance of surviving five years, and counseled
me to weigh my prognosis carefully in relationship to my pregnancy
_ my child could be motherless.
</P>
<P>
   We left the office, and I still had not dropped one tear. That
night, I broke down and wailed in my husband's arms.
</P>
<P>
   Breast cancer is the most common cancer in pregnant and
postpartum women, occurring in one in 3,000 pregnant women,
according to the National Cancer Institute. The average patient is
32 to 38 years old. And while there are no firm statistics, the
consensus is that the number of cases is rising.
</P>
<P>
   ``The incidence of pregnancy breast cancer is increasing just
because women are getting pregnant at older ages, when breast
cancer is more common,'' said Dr. Jeanne A. Petrek, director of the
Evelyn H. Lauder Breast Center of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Pregnancy coinciding with breast cancer is a complex problem
without straightforward answers for the mother, as I soon
discovered.
</P>
<P>
   My case was reviewed by two tumor boards, panels of oncologists
who advise treatment for difficult cancer cases. Both the one in
Albuquerque, where I live, and another at Scripps Memorial Hospital
in San Diego advised that I follow the same plan: therapeutic
abortion, mastectomy, chemotherapy, radiation and tamoxifen
hormonal therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams of doctors were concerned, first, with saving my
life. They recommended removing what made the case so different _
the baby. The rising hormonal levels of pregnancy, which could
encourage cancer growth, would be halted. Treatment could be more
aggressive and started earlier. They considered this my best chance
for survival.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side were the doctors I came to refer to as the
``baby people'': Dr. Krista Wills, my obstetrician; Dr. Gary
Aisenbrey, my high-risk obstetrician; and Dr. Richard Giudice, my
oncologist. They cited case studies of pregnant women who delivered
healthy babies after receiving chemotherapy in the second and third
trimesters, once fetal organs and limbs are formed. They concluded
that specific chemotherapy drugs administered after the first
trimester were a reasonable risk for the baby and an effective
treatment for me.
</P>
<P>
   They also believed in the positive effect of keeping my
pregnancy. Depression and stress from aborting a deeply desired
child could weaken my immune system and reduce my body's ability to
fight the cancer.
</P>
<P>
   I was presented with these two opinions. The final decision
could only be mine, although my husband and I had to face the many
possibilities together. Our late-night discussions prompted
stress-induced insomnia and forced us to make a rule: no cancer
talk after 8 p.m. But still the questions haunted us day and night.
Were we willing to raise a child with birth defects? Could we give
up this pregnancy? Were he and I prepared to give my life for the
child's? Was he willing to be a single father?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we both wanted two things _ me alive and a healthy
baby. Mark said he would support me in the choices I made.
</P>
<P>
   Within three weeks of the first biopsy results I underwent a
lumpectomy, a bone scan, blood tests and ultrasounds to detect any
spread of the cancer and then the removal of my left breast.
Confirming the aggressiveness of the cancer, the mastectomy
revealed that five of the 13 axillary lymph nodes were invaded by
cancer cells. There were no indications the cancer had spread to
other parts of my body, however. This placed my disease at IIB of
IV stages.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the test results, I needed more information. I read,
ate crackers, drank ginger tea for morning sickness that lasted all
day, read and read some more.
</P>
<P>
   I scoured a database developed by Dr. John J. Mulvihill, the
director of the Program in Human Genetics at the University of
Oklahoma, containing information on some 300 pregnancies in which
the women were exposed to chemotherapeutic agents. The project
draws no conclusions, but as a guide to oncologists it gives
details of the type and amount of drugs used at particular stages
of pregnancy and the outcome of each case.
</P>
<P>
   In my research it became quickly apparent that pregnant women
with breast cancer generally have poor prognoses, not just because
of hormonal and biological changes experienced during pregnancy,
but also because of the delay of treatment until after delivery. In
addition, several medical papers cited evidence that termination of
the pregnancy did not change the outcome for the patients.
</P>
<P>
   As I read encouraging data for keeping my pregnancy, an intense
anger toward the tumor boards' cut-and-dried attitude grew and
grew. I wanted them to be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   If I could only talk to someone who had been through this
ordeal. I needed to hear these words from another woman: ``Yes, I
went through chemotherapy when I was pregnant with my son five
years ago. He's right in front of me this minute, running around
healthy and normal, and I'm fine.''
</P>
<P>
   But back in those pre-Internet-chat-room days, I never did find
anyone in my same situation to talk to.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, based on the information I gathered, I made a leap of
faith. We would fight my cancer, we would keep the pregnancy, and I
believed our baby would be healthy. Most important, despite the
statistical chances of my survival, I chose to believe that I would
live to attend his high school graduation.
</P>
<P>
   My belly started to round. My right breast swelled. The left
side of my chest was flat and smooth with a tidy scar running from
the center of my chest horizontally eight inches to the left and
finishing midway under my arm. My breast and most lymph nodes were
gone, but I still had my child. The baby had survived the
mastectomy in excellent shape, but we had a fight for our lives
ahead of us.
</P>
<P>
   At 14 weeks' pregnant, a ``safer'' time for the fetus, I began
my chemotherapy regimen: a combination of the drugs Adriamycin,
Cytoxan and ''5FU'' (fluorouracil) _ six months of treatments
delivered at three-week intervals. Radiation would begin after I
delivered my baby.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was to finish the treatments a few weeks before the
baby was due. This would give me time to recover my strength and
rebuild my immune system before the physical demands of labor and
delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Overwhelming exhaustion from the chemo possessed me every third
week. The first two weeks of every cycle I was just
pregnancy-exhausted. They told me I would lose my hair. I bought a
wig and waited. Each month my high-risk obstetrician performed an
ultrasound to monitor my baby's growth _ he was growing like a
champ.
</P>
<P>
   My oncologist was amazed at how well I tolerated the chemo. I
did not lose my hair. I pushed through my exhaustion to exercise;
forced myself to eat well; took vitamins and herbs to strengthen my
immune system; and thought positively about the future of our new
family.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing was normal about my pregnancy. But we tried to make it
seem so and took joy out of my expanding belly, baby showers,
nightly caramel turtle fudge ice cream trips and exposing our
unborn son to classical music and lullabies.
</P>
<P>
   The weeks of pregnancy and chemotherapy treatments ticked by.
Everything went fine until eight weeks before my due date. I went
into premature labor, one of the risks on which all the literature
agreed. Medication and full bed rest stopped the inevitable for a
month.
</P>
<P>
   Four weeks early, after a five-hour labor and natural delivery,
I cuddled to my remaining breast my long-awaited baby: Tanner J.
Wilson, beautiful, healthy, normal.
</P>
<P>
   Seven days after Tanner's birth I underwent my eighth and last
chemo treatment. I submitted once again to weeks of fatigue and
weakness as the nurse inserted the IV into a vein in my right hand.
I knew I would lack the strength to care for our new son by myself.
But I had to have the last treatment. What if one renegade cell
remained? It had to be snuffed out.
</P>
<P>
   Now, six years later, Tanner shows no ill effects of exposure to
chemotherapy. He is articulate, delightfully curious and as
challenging as any 5-year-old when he digs in his heels. He runs,
cartwheels and kicks a mean soccer ball.
</P>
<P>
   As for me, one renegade cell did remain. My cancer returned. In
1996, when Tanner was 15 months old, we found it had spread to my
sternum, the breast bone. This time the treatment was high-dose
chemotherapy with stem-cell rescue. Stem cells, immature cells from
which all blood cells develop, are removed from the body, treated
to kill cancer cells, then frozen. After very high doses of
chemotherapy are administered to the patient, killing healthy cells
as well as cancer cells, the stem cells are returned in hope that
they grow new healthy cells.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this aggressive regimen, in January 1999 a biopsy showed
that the cancer had remained in the sternum and was growing. I had
one radical option left.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, my oncologist, Dr. Giudice, helped me find a
talented and compassionate team of surgeons at the M.D. Anderson
Cancer Center at the University of Texas in Houston. I had my
sternum removed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after a painful six-month recovery and with a new
strong-as-bone plastic sternum, I look and feel better than I have
in six years. I am writing children's books, enjoying my son and
husband and continuing to look at the world through the eyes of a
cancer survivor. We see things differently _ all colors are
brilliant, music creates pictures, nature is more precious.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Cancer Society, a person with a bone
metastasis _ cancer spread beyond the initial site to bone _ has a
16 percent chance of surviving five years, although general health
and individual circumstances can raise the odds.
</P>
<P>
   At this moment, I am part of that 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although I had always been convinced I would be one of those
survivors, I still treasure each milestone we reach with Tanner.
When he was born, I would say to Mark, ``We'll be blessed if I live
long enough to see Tanner walk.'' Our next goal was Tanner out of
diapers, then riding his first bike with training wheels. Now, it's
time for me to meet his kindergarten teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Would terminating my pregnancy have prevented the recurrences or
changed my survival possibilities? The medical community has mixed
opinions. But regardless of my final outcome, I know that I would
not have done anything differently.

12-year-olds, will be published next year by Holiday House.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Plant enthusiasts have a tendency to be rather florid, if you'll
pardon the pun, when they describe their favorite species. But
hydrangeas number among those species for which the word
``remarkable'' can be used without exaggeration. How many plant
families can trace their history back 70 million years, are native
to three continents, contain members that are bushes, trees and
vines, are both deciduous and evergreen and have flowers that can
completely change color from year to year or season to season?
</P>
<P>
   This is not to mention that almost all hydrangeas are extremely
hardy, easy to grow and tolerate both full sun and partial shade. A
variety of hydrangea exists to suit any garden, from clay pots to
meticulously cultivated acres.
</P>
<P>
   The genus hydrangea is actually divided into at least eight
subsections, which are further broken down into at least a dozen
species and hundreds of cultivars _ though there are so many
different kinds of hydrangeas that even the botanical
nomenclaturists are often in disagreement as to the exact number.
It simplifies matters that the most common types of hydrangeas seen
in nurseries today belong to only five species: macrophylla,
paniculata, quercifolia, anomala and arborescens, and from each of
these I've selected one or two varieties that I think are real
knockouts in the garden.
</P>
<P>
   HYDRANGEA MACROPHYLLA 'Generale Vicomtesse de Vibraye': The
macrophyllas, often called somewhat erroneously the Lacecap
hydrangeas, are the species that most often come to mind when
people think of hydrangeas. Native to the temperate maritime
climates of eastern Asia, these are the potted plants often seen in
florist shops; in fact, the Generale is a common variety for
forcing indoors and container growing.
</P>
<P>
   Flowering continuously from early summer with large, pale
blooms, this wonderful shrub will grow quite large if given the
moist, mild (hardiness Zone 6 or warmer), dappled shade it loves.
The macrophyllas are also the hydrangea species that are capable of
the famous color-changing trick: In acid soil (pH 6.5 or less) the
bloom is blue: Add a little lime, and presto, subsequent blooms
will turn pink. The flower heads are also excellent for drying,
turning a lovely dusky hue.
</P>
<P>
   H. PANICULATA 'Grandiflora': Also known as the PeeGee hydrangea,
``H. paniculata'' is a common sight in many parts of the country.
Generally forming a shrub 6 to 10 feet high, 'Grandiflora' can also
be pruned to form a small, single-stemmed tree _ a shape
particularly beloved by the Victorians. Pruned upright, the large
blossoms, opening pink and then gradually turning to white, are
able to dangle enticingly in even the faintest breeze.
'Grandiflora' flowers _ buried inside the bloom heads _ are famous
for their drying ability. ``H. paniculata'' is extremely hardy
(Zones 3 and 4) and prefers full sun. Another worthwhile cultivar
is 'Tardiva,' which, as the name suggests, blooms much later than
'Grandiflora.'
</P>
<P>
   H. QUERCIFOLIA 'Snow Queen': This is one of my favorite members
of the hydrangea family, and, unfortunately, one of the least
known. The species name ``quercifolia'' means ``oak-leaved'' in
Latin, and the epithet is apt.
</P>
<P>
   The large oak-like leaves emerge fairly late in the spring,
followed in midsummer by large panicles of creamy white flowers 6
to 8 inches long. Like most other hydrangeas, this one requires a
constant supply of moisture; given extended periods of dryness,
most hydrangeas will wilt miserably. But unlike its cousins that
prefer at least partial sun, this beauty will take a considerable
amount of shade, and for that reason I like to use oakleaved
hydrangeas in the landscape as backdrops to hosta, astilbe and
other shade-loving plants. Hardy to Zone 5, ``H. quercifolia'' has
the added benefit of lovely fall color _ the leaves turn purple-red
and remain on the plant for quite a long time.
</P>
<P>
   H. ARBORESCENS 'Annabelle': This is a stellar plant, and one
that should be in almost every landscape. Growing between 3 and 5
feet high, this American native is covered in huge white balls of
flower in June, some up to 12 inches in diameter. In fact, this
generosity in flowers may be its only flaw _ 'Annabelle' is so
floriferous that the huge blooms will often weigh down and
occasionally snap the branches after a heavy rain. This cultivar
also has the added benefit of reblooming, if the first round of
blossoms is removed when spent.
</P>
<P>
   Tolerant of light shade, 'Annabelle' requires a moist though
well drained spot with reasonably high fertility to produce the
best show. Hardy from Zones 3 to 9, this shrub is perfect for mass
plantings on the edge of the woods or lawn.
</P>
<P>
   H. ANOMALA subsp. ``petiolaris'': The lustrous, dark-green
leaves of this climbing member of the hydrangea family are the
perfect background for the large, fragrant white flowers, which
open in June and July and last for more than a month. Tolerant of
sun or shade, climbing hydrangeas ascend by twining, making them
ideal for growing up the side of a trellis or tree.
</P>
<P>
   Left on their own, the vines can reach 80 feet; in bloom, they
are an almost unimaginably beautiful sight. Virtually pest-free,
the only drawback to this species is that it is almost painfully
slow to get started: The first few years the plant seems to hardly
move at all, and then, suddenly, the growth is exponential.
Originating in China and Japan, climbing hydrangeas are hardy from
Zones 4 to 8.

WIRELESS WEB: PALMS HOLD PROMISE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Editors, in 12th graf: It took, etc., note that (Star) has been
used as a substitute for the asterisk) 
(For release Sunday, August 13) 
 By BOB TEDESCHI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   By now, it's almost a consensus among Internet pundits that the
future of the Web rests in the hands _ or, perhaps more
appropriately, the palms _ of those who make wireless Internet
devices and software. Why would consumers want to be shackled to a
desktop computer, the thinking goes, when they could roam freely
with a hand-held device that gives them everything they need?
</P>
<P>
   Since mobile Internet devices like Web-connected cellular phones
and so-called personal digital assistants (PDA's) like the Palm VII
were born and bred for on-the-road use, futurists have dreamed up
especially rosy scenarios for travel applications.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the problem. Nearly all the talk surrounding mobile
Internet devices and applications is in the future tense.
</P>
<P>
   You will be able to program your phone to call you when you're
on the road and alert you to shoes that are on sale, in your size,
at the store you happen to be walking past at that moment. You will
be able to tap the screen a couple of times on your cell phone and
have a guide tell you about a tourist site without actually having
to have a human near you. (Heaven forbid that should happen.)
</P>
<P>
   And on it goes. The reality is that today's wireless Internet
offerings look a lot like the wired Internet offerings of 1995.
They're useful if you have patience and are willing to spend the
money on the hardware and the connection time. But they can also
present frustrating limitations.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that, because businesses see such huge demand
for wireless Internet gizmos, it won't take five years for the
technology to improve dramatically. Some particularly useful travel
applications, in fact, are arriving en masse this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every company that caters to the traveler has some
semblance of a wireless Internet strategy and is working hard to
refine it. For instance, Travelocity offers wireless users the
option of checking their flight status, and by summer's end will
allow users to change their flight itineraries from their wireless
phones. So if you get off your plane and discover _ along with the
other 200 people on the plane _ that your connecting flight has
been canceled, you can conceivably skip the mad dash to the
customer service desk and simply call up the Travelocity site to
make the change.
</P>
<P>
   Trip.com already has such a feature. By pushing a button on a
cell phone, you get options for rebooking your flight. So if you
are late for a flight or have already missed it, you can select
from the next available flights, press a button and see a
confirmation number on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Like many such services, this feature requires a little work
beforehand on a desktop computer. Typically, users must register
personal information and a credit card number with the site _ or,
in Trip.com's case, book a flight with the site _ so they can avoid
the maddening task of inputting numbers and text on a wireless
device.
</P>
<P>
   I recently tested a Palm VII, the latest technological wizardry.
It retails for about $500, with unlimited Internet access through
Palm.net for about $45 a month. I pretended I was lost going home
from an appointment, and tapped on the MapQuest.com icon.
</P>
<P>
   As with most other Internet sites on wireless devices, MapQuest
has, in the interest of speed, modified its site to include only
bare essentials _ no photos, no graphics. MapQuest started me
immediately with a form to fill in addresses for directions.
</P>
<P>
   It took a lot of tapping to get the addresses typed in, but
about five minutes later, I had step-by-step directions home.
Buoyed by my success, I checked the status of an imaginary flight I
was taking to San Francisco. I went to the Travelocity site on my
Palm and tapped the icon for departure and arrival information, and
it told me the scheduled times for departure and arrival. Then it
informed me that the actual times of departure and arrival were
``:61???'' and ``:92???(STAR)'' respectively. Lower down on the
screen, the site told me the asterisk denotes the estimated arrival
time, which helped clear things up tremendously.
</P>
<P>
   My trusty cell phone was next. I tried to get directions, but
that involved entering text using the phone's keypad. For this, you
hold down the ``2'' button, for instance, until the screen shows
the letter ``C,'' then press the ``7'' button until you get an
``S,'' and so on. Talk about a recipe for road rage.
</P>
<P>
   After about 10 minutes of this, my phone told me that my home
address did not exist, which made me consider driving my car over
my phone so that it, too, did not exist.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Americans who use wireless devices to gain access
to the Internet will be about 1.3 million by year's end _ most
through cell phones, with PDA's like the Palm VII accounting for
roughly 300,000, according to the Yankee Group, a technology
consulting firm. Analysts and executives say that will grow to 38
million by 2002, with 30 million cell phones connected to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the sudden growth is that the next generation of
wireless Internet devices will likely combine the phone and the
Personal Digital Assistant, eliminating the cost of multiple units.
Next year's cell phone/PDAs will also likely have touch screens,
with prices comparable to or lower than today's units, and faster
connections.
</P>
<P>
   Today's wireless devices typically connect at speeds of about 14
kilobits to 19 kilobits per second, a far cry from a 56-kbps modem,
but because the sites have done their best to create text-only
presentations, the sluggish connection is not too much of a burden.
And as connection speeds increase, Internet connection fees should
drop, analysts said, because telecommunications companies will find
other ways to pay the freight of the service, such as getting a
percentage of transactions made by users.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, offerings from Internet sites will improve
quickly, giving users more reason to get unplugged, as it were.
Zagat, for instance, now lets wireless users get the names of
restaurants in different cities, review their ratings, and press a
button to call the establishment. Starting next month, the
reservation will be made by pushing a button; in November, hotel
and spa ratings and reservations will be added.
</P>
<P>
   Through a service called Tellme (www.tellme.com), users can look
up Zagat's content _ and that of other Web sites _ by speaking
their requests into the phone. There is something odd about
speaking into a phone to get Internet content, but for someone who
doesn't want to risk life and limb to look at the screen on their
cell phone or PDA, the service is comforting.
</P>
<P>
   For travelers who want to take in a show or a sporting event
while on the road, Ticketmaster-CitySearch offers wireless options
_ and, notably, options that don't require you to type in ``Hootie
and the Blowfish'' on your cell phone. Through the Ticketmaster
wireless site, users choose a city and their area of interest, such
as music or sports, and choices appear on the screen. If users have
already registered their credit card information with Ticketmaster
on its nonwireless Web page (www.ticketmaster.com), they can buy
tickets with a press of a button or a tap on their PDA screen.
</P>
<P>
   Such oases will be increasingly common. And while such features
will be enough to lure some of the more technology-addicted
travelers to hand-held devices, for those who want more potency and
less potential from their wireless, it's a wait-till-next-year
story.

<P>
   As air travel set a record earlier this summer _ with major
domestic airlines flying fuller planes than at any time since World
War II _ Newark Airport, the New York area's busiest, was putting
its monorail on sick leave. The system was partly shut for repairs
on July 8 and will be completely closed after Labor Day, possibly
till the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The five-year-old monorail has been handling 30,000 people a
day, getting them, their luggage and wheelchairs in from car-rental
sites and parking lots, shifting them among the three terminals and
returning them to drop-off spots. Now, according to John S. Jacoby,
assistant manager of airport services for Newark, the contractor
must repair a flaw that causes the rails to ice over in winter.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was not happy news for Newark, the nation's 11th
busiest airport, which handled 33.9 million passengers in the 12
months that ended April 30, as against Kennedy Airport's 32.2
million. Newark, already in the midst of construction projects
affecting most of its 2,000 acres, decided to postpone the full
shutdown until after the summer crush. Jacoby said it was hoped the
repair could be completed in three months, but a return by
Thanksgiving is doubtful, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The monorail is now serving only the central portion of its
normal route, linking Terminals A, B and C and Station D-1, the
site for Avis, Hertz and National, and some parking. It skips three
stops: D-2, a site for Budget and Dollar and the pickup spot for
off-airport rental companies; D-3, a parking area, and E, which
serves a parking area, vans from hotels and motels and off-airport
parking, and valet parking. The stops not reached by the monorail
are served by 35 buses marked by construction-orange signs. After
Labor Day, more than 50 buses will fill in.
</P>
<P>
   The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates
the airport, suggests that travelers using Newark allow at least 30
minutes more travel time than their airline recommends; it is
probably smart to add 15 minutes more to figure out what you are
doing. Here is a little help:
</P>
<P>
   All air passengers must at some point rely on rubber-tired
wheels to get to Kennedy, La Guardia or Newark; short of using a
helicopter, it remains impossible to get all the way without
risking traffic tie-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Until a new station links the Amtrak-New Jersey Transit rail
lines to a new monorail station, planned for a year from now,
Newark has the poorest junction with rapid transit. Most New
Jerseyans get there by car, and Jacoby believes they prefer it that
way.
</P>
<P>
   He says the airport has 16,000 parking spots, and 6,500 more are
being created in two huge garages, one by Monorail Station E and
one by Continental's Terminal C. These are expected to open next
year. Construction, however, is tearing up existing lots in
sequence, and Jacoby says it is impossible to say from day to day
how many spaces are lost. Despite this, he says, lots are seldom
entirely filled; the big complaint is that people cannot park where
they want.
</P>
<P>
   On holidays, when business travel slows and leisure travel
rises, the long-term economy lots can be swamped with vacationers
seeking $8-a-day rates. Then, Jacoby said, drivers may be directed
to spaces in daily lots, where they are given parking checks that
entitle them to a bargain: $8 instead of $24 a day. When everything
does fill, he said, directions are posted to private areas off the
airport. In such situations, Jacoby said, the operators may
distribute discount coupons.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, travelers using private cars should enlist someone to
drop them off. The bad part of that plan is the return, when the
pickup person must call to see if the plane is on time, which in
May happened only 66.4 percent of the time at Newark.
</P>
<P>
   Another alternative is valet parking, at $18 a day. Customers
tell the attendants when they are due back, and get a phone number
to call with changes. The car is brought from a remote lot in time
for the return.
</P>
<P>
   Families with children who want to use the cheaper lots should
budget time for two loops through congested roadways. On the first,
an adult should deposit everyone else and all the bags to start the
check-in. Then the driver should park and ride the free bus back to
the terminal.
</P>
<P>
   Getting to Newark from the east shore of the Hudson usually
involves taking a bus from the midtown Port Authority Bus Terminal,
Penn Station or Grand Central. The timetable says Olympia Airport
Express, but Coach USA now owns the company. The fare is $11 one
way, $20 round trip. A round-trip fare of $10 is available to
passengers displaying Medicare cards or New Jersey Transit Reduced
Fare identification cards. Reduced-fare MetroCards with photos,
used in the New York City transit system by senior citizens, are
not recognized.
</P>
<P>
   The right terminal at Newark is not an automatic choice,
particularly if you are flying Continental, which handles half of
Newark's passengers. It has flights at Terminals A, B and C,
depending on the destination.
</P>
<P>
   Its flights to Chicago, Atlanta and Dallas leave from Terminal
A. Terminal B is the international arrivals building, but
Continental's London flights leave from there. The majority of the
line's flights use Terminal C, although pressure like this summer's
can cause the line to shift to any available gate: on June 30, the
line reported 89.7 percent of its seats were filled, a record. A
system called code-sharing also confuses the issue because a flight
sold under one airline's name may be flown by another line out of
that line's gate. Gates 10 to 39 are in Terminal A. Gates 40 to 68
are in Terminal B. Gates 70 to 121 are in Terminal C.
</P>
<P>
   Until Labor Day, the monorail is the best way to travel between
terminals. It runs on the outside curve of the three terminals at
the concourse level, reached by escalators and elevators. It
accommodates wheelchairs and luggage carts. (Domestic passengers
pay $1.50 to rent carts; people coming through Customs get them
free.) In two midday tests, monorails arrived pretty promptly.
</P>
<P>
   The bypass buses, by Jacoby design, do not pick up passengers
while they discharge them: they pick up, go someplace and
discharge, then start over. Bus arrivals are designed to be five
minutes apart. These buses are boarded in the outdoor bus bays to
the left of each terminal as you exit. The buses are tied into a
global positioning system using satellites so that dispatchers can
direct them where they are needed.
</P>
<P>
   The buses frequently have luggage racks, but luggage carts
cannot be rolled aboard, as they can onto the monorail. So
passengers using bypass buses will have to cough up another $1.50
for a new cart. Wheelchairs also cannot go aboard the buses.
Red-jacketed customer service representatives call for
wheelchair-accessible vans.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, despite the dust and mud outside, the inside of
Terminal C presents a much improved environment. Staples, Speedo,
the Museum Co., the Discovery Channel and other places to buy
things you might want or need have opened in recent months. A
counter that sells CD's is just outside the Continental Young
Travelers Club, where children traveling alone await connecting
flights if their parents pay a fee of $60 or more. On a recent
Tuesday, eight young people were inside watching television; the
Garden State Diner was SRO.
</P>
<P>
   Sets of benches have been placed at the marked meeting spots for
limousine drivers; considering Newark's record for delays, it seems
like a humane gesture.

   LOWES-FORESTS _ Lowe's will detail its new policy to phase out
``old-growth'' wood a day before its official announcement.
Environmentalists are giddy about Lowe's plan, which they say
outmuscles Home Depot's. Both retailers are requiring vendors to
prove their products come from well-managed forests. And both are
using standards developed by the Forest Stewardship Council, which
has big forest companies irked because they've developed their own
voluntary plan. We'll update Home Depot's progress, plus talk about
thorny issues in the South, where private landowners own most
timberland. (Bond, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 18.

   WASHINGTON _ By choosing to run for the White House with Sen.
Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, Vice President Al Gore came about
as close as he decently could to sticking a finger in President
Clinton's eye.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, a senior Democratic legislator of impeccable personal
integrity, was the party's most thoughtful _ and most devastating _
critic of Clinton's inexcusable behavior during his affair with
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans never directly mentioned her during their
convention, but they didn't have to. They constantly deplored the
decline of presidential character and the administration's failure
to respect the dignity of the Oval Office. Everybody got the
message.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman is Gore's answer to the concentrated, oily GOP
campaign to lump the vice president's behavior with that of the
president. ``We will never think of one without thinking of the
other,'' GOP vice presidential nominee Dick Cheney intoned.
</P>
<P>
   It was practicing guilt by association at the highest political
level. We were encouraged to believe that there is no philosophical
or ethical difference between Clinton and Gore, even though insofar
as anyone knows, Gore's private life is spotless.
</P>
<P>
   And judging by the polls immediately following the GOP
convention that give Gov. George W. Bush a healthy lead of 17
percentage points, the assault was working.
</P>
<P>
   So Gore picked a little-known but respected Orthodox Jew who was
the first of his party to stand up on the Senate floor and condemn
Clinton's behavior as ``not just inappropriate but immoral It is
wrong and unacceptable.'' The popular senator delivered a stern
lecture about the importance of good values in family and political
life.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said he thought the president ought to be censured,
and ultimately he refused to jump party lines to convict Clinton of
any impeachable offense. But his criticism shook the Clinton White
House, encouraged other Democrats to join in and reinforced his
image as the moral conscience of his party.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's religious values are not cosmetic, as they are with
some politicians. He practices what he believes. He is so serious
about his faith that he refuses to campaign or do nonessential
chores during the Jewish Sabbath, which he observes from sundown
Friday to sundown Saturday. His interpretation of religious family
values has also led him to crusade against sexually explicit and
violent films, music, television programs and video games.
</P>
<P>
   With Lieberman, Gore is practicing what the Republicans preached
in Philadelphia _ inclusiveness. As the first Jew on a major
party's national ticket, Lieberman will test the country's true
tolerance of religious diversity.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a measure of our country's greatness that our leaders
do not fear to tread where others have never gone before. In the
relatively dark ages of 1960, Sen. John F. Kennedy similarly
challenged public resistance to the idea of a Catholic president
and broke that particular barrier forever. Religion has not been a
dominant issue since, although Christian, especially evangelical,
leaders have until this year heavily influenced GOP politics.
</P>
<P>
   A recent CNN-USA Today Gallup poll indicates that 92 percent of
those surveyed said they would vote for a Jewish person for
president, but nobody knows whether some people simply refuse to
admit to anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, this was Gore's bold move to shake up the
established thinking, much as Walter Mondale in 1984 chose
Geraldine Ferraro as the first female running mate on a major
ticket in hopes of breaking President Ronald Reagan's lead in the
polls. It didn't succeed but it did attract women in droves to the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The gray-haired Lieberman, 58, is not the symbol of
forward-looking youth that Gore had indicated he was seeking when
he considered junior senators. Instead, he opted for a running mate
who is qualified to become president if necessary, who supports
abortion rights and gun control and who is generally in the middle
of the road on defense and foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   To attack Lieberman as a liberal counterpoint to Cheney's
extreme conservatism won't wash, based on Lieberman's record. He is
the chairman of the Democratic Leadership Council, a vehicle to
advance moderate Democratic policies that Clinton also once headed.
He is, in fact, a Clinton-style Democrat in legislative and
economic matters. Wall Street should be comfortable with this
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman was not disloyal to his party in condemning the
president's bad behavior. Nor is Gore disloyal in running with a
man who openly disapproved of an immoral White House. Gore himself
has said he thinks Clinton did wrong in the Lewinsky affair, while
sticking to his general support of administration policies and
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is not Clinton any more than Dubya is Daddy Bush. This is a
new ball game. And the sooner the country accepts that and gets on
with the real election contest, the better off we will all be.

 &HT;    GOP says Lieberman sounds like a Republican
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a back-handed compliment, the George W. Bush presidential
campaign on Monday hailed the opposition's newly announced running
mate as a good man with some good ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman's ideas are so good,
according to Bush-Cheney campaign spokesman Ari Fleischer, that
they sound more Republican that Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney respect Joe Lieberman for
his intelligence, his integrity, and for many of the positions he
has taken, positions which Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney
support but Al Gore has attacked,'' Fleischer said. ``From Social
Security reform to missile defense, tort reform to parental
notification (abortion), and from school choice to affirmative
action, Al Gore has chosen a man whose positions are more similar
to Governor Bush's than to his own.''
</P>
<P>
   It adds up to good news for Bush, Fleischer added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that Al Gore is willing to select a running mate
whose positions he has attacked throughout this campaign will cause
many to question Al Gore's commitment to the positions he takes,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut on Monday, Lieberman said he and Gore ``have
walked pretty much the same path,'' but acknowledged some
differences on issues.
</P>
<P>
   Those differences include the Democratic ticketmates' positions
on school vouchers. Gore takes the party line that vouchers are a
one-way ticket to ruination of the public schools. Lieberman has
sponsored several measures that would have set up experimental
programs allowing parents to use government education dollars to
send their kids to private schools.
</P>
<P>
   Bush favors that concept, which Lieberman has backed away from
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman also sides with Bush _ and against Gore _ on the
concept of partial privatization of Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   The selection of Lieberman, a vocal critic of President
Clinton's liaisons with Monica Lewinsky, though he voted not to
remove the president from office, comes in the wake of the Bush
campaign's effort to link Gore with the worst of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``And now, as the man from Hope goes home to New York, Mr. Gore
tries to separate himself from his leader's shadow,'' Cheney said
in his acceptance speech in Philadelphia last week. ``But somehow
we will never see one without thinking of the other.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lieberman selection, the first Jew to be on a national
ticket, also could bring new focus to Bush comments that brought
questions from some Jews in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, prior to his successful 1994 gubernatorial campaign,
Bush, a Methodist, said his religion tells him that heaven is open
only to people who accept Jesus Christ as their savior.
</P>
<P>
   He later said the comment was misunderstood. In 1998, after a
discussion with Bush, Abraham Foxman, national director of the
Anti-Defamation League, said he believes Bush harbors no religious
intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   Foxman, who on Monday hailed Gore's selection of Lieberman for
the Democratic ticket, issued a 1998 statement saying Bush had
proven his ``commitment to tolerance, diversity and the principles
of religious freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Foxman, Bush said he was ``troubled that some
people were hurt by my remarks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Judgments about heaven do not belong in the realm of politics
or this world; they belong to a higher authority,'' Bush told
Foxman.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Bush drew criticism for issuing a gubernatorial
proclamation designating June 10 as ``Jesus Day'' in Texas in
conjunction with the annual March for Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   The American Jewish Congress criticized Bush for mixing state
and church, calling the proclamation an ``egregious example'' of an
elected official trying to ``accommodate the religious views'' of
constituents.
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides responded by noting he also had issued proclamations
honoring other religious organizations and places of worship.

<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ A newly humble President Abdurrahman Wahid
apologized to the nation Monday for falling short of expectations
as Indonesia struggles to build a working democracy and said he
would name an executive minister to bring order to his flailing
administration.
</P>
<P>
   In a state-of-the-nation speech that opened a restive annual
parliamentary session, Wahid said he would begin concentrating more
on foreign affairs and would create a sort of prime ministerial
post to handle day-to-day domestic affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Admired for his integrity, democratic ideals and intellect,
Wahid has drawn constant criticism for his disorganized and
impulsive leadership style. He has talked in the past of delegating
daily administration to a chief-of-staff. The harshness of much of
the attacks reflects what many analysts call the political
immaturity of a nation whose growth was stunted by three decades of
authoritarian rule under former President Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid has made foreign affairs something of a hobby, visiting 30
countries _ some of them several times _ during his 10 months in
office, even as Indonesia struggles with economic collapse,
sectarian violence, separatist movements and political disarray.
</P>
<P>
   The president, 60, who is virtually blind, has talked in the
past of delegating daily administration to a chief-of-staff. He had
his speech read by an aide today as he sat nearby, occasionally
dozing off. Wahid said Monday that the new ministerial post would
be part of a broad reorganization of his bloated and feuding
cabinet, which is widely expected to include the creation of a more
focused and professional economic team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not comfortable with details, so he will need somebody
to run day-to-day governance for him,'' said Sarwono Kusumaatmadja,
a cabinet member who is minister of maritime affairs.
</P>
<P>
   After clashing repeatedly with the noisy legislature over the
past months, Wahid suddenly changed tack Monday, as he often does,
and was contrite.
</P>
<P>
   ``To all the people of Indonesia, I humbly apologize for being
unable to fully solve the prevailing problems during the last 10
months,'' he said. ``Rest assured, however, that we would work even
harder to strive for more accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am really more than willing to do whatever necessary to
improve the performance of the government by adopting proper
policies and strategies and sharpening agendas and priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Wahid's speech, lasting nearly 90 minutes, was a powerful tour
of the political scene, laying out his vision for a tolerant,
inclusive, democratic nation and echoing many analysts in blaming
the current problems on the aftermath of Suharto's 32-year rule.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto, 79, who was forced from office in May 1998, was charged
with corruption last Thursday. His case is expected to be presented
to a court this week.
</P>
<P>
   The day's session was also a demonstration of the chaotic new
openness and personal quirkiness that have supplanted Suharto's
dour style and harsh grip on all aspects of national affairs.
</P>
<P>
   After opening _ as always _ with a joke or two, Wahid said that
his political secretary, Marislam Simanjuntak, would read his
speech for him.
</P>
<P>
   Then Wahid, who tends to fall asleep at public meetings, dozed
off several times during the reading of his own speech. In what
appeared to be a planned tactic, an adjutant woke him each time by
handing him a hard candy to suck on.
</P>
<P>
   In another signal that the Suharto years were over, the assembly
began with a clamor when a dozen or so of the 700 delegates sought
to make procedural points by shouting ``Interruption!
Interruption!''
</P>
<P>
   The interruption is a parliamentary motion that allows delegates
from the floor to be heard. During Suharto's 32 years in power this
break with enforced unanimity was almost never heard; indeed it led
at least once to the expulsion of a member from the assembly.
</P>
<P>
   There was widespread speculation Monday that the new executive
manager would be a prominent former lieutenant general, Susilo
Bambang Yudhoyuno, a military reformer who is now the minister of
mines and energy.
</P>
<P>
   But members of the government said Vice President Megawati
Sukarnoputri, a powerful figure who leads the country's largest
party, might want the job for herself.
</P>
<P>
   Such a development, they said, could complicate government by
creating competing power centers. Though Megawati is not herself an
aggressive manager, she has created a respected minicabinet of her
own.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the morning, Megawati, whose passivity contrasts with
Wahid's puckishness, showed no expression, busying herself with
wiping her neck and her glasses with a small cloth and rattling a
small fan beside her face.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's session was remarkable for one other development: the
excitement was confined to the parliament chamber. This is the
first major political event since Suharto's departure that has not
been accompanied by turmoil and bloodshed on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Though security forces prepared, as they have in the past, with
a huge contingent of nearly 30,000 soldiers and police officers,
there were no mass rallies. The small orange buses with students
dancing on the roofs, the face-offs with police, the stone-throwing
and baton charges of past demonstrations were conspicuously absent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think things will stay calm,'' said Sarwono. ``It has become
very hard to mobilize and agitate the people now because the public
is sending strong signals that they want stability.''
</P>
<P>
   In this respect, perhaps, Wahid has made headway as he seeks to
calm the nation. Analysts agree that most of the problems for which
he absorbs the blame run deep and defy quick solution.
</P>
<P>
   Having acknowledged his shortcomings, Wahid, in his prepared
speech, strongly affirmed the ideals that are the banner of his
administration as it seeks to pull Indonesia toward cohesion and
cooperation and away from the bloodshed and fragmentation that
threaten it in the wake of Suharto's departure.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that he had taken the difficult step of bringing the
politically powerful military under civilian control, had promoted
human rights and permitted a free and open press, had taken steps
to combat government corruption and had worked to nurse an economic
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, he had opened negotiations with separatist
movements in Aceh and Irian Jaya.
</P>
<P>
   A number of these actions have had decidedly mixed results. The
military remains divided and restive with a breakdown in the chain
of command that has contributed to horrific bloodshed in the Maluku
Islands, where more than 3,000 people have been killed in the past
18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Violence also continues in Aceh and Irian Jaya.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Corruption remains widespread and Wahid himself has come under
attack for several questionable deals and allocations of funds.
Most troubling, the faltering economy _ which precipitated
Suharto's fall _ has not been healed.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid's promised government changes could directly address this
problem. Although analysts say some economic fundamentals now
appear stronger, the currency has continued to slide in value and
foreign investors have stayed away. This has largely been because
of political uncertainties that have been aggravated by Wahid's
unpredictable style and the disarray of his economic management.
</P>
<P>
   Although the parliamentary session, which will last until Aug
18, was preceded by a surge of political squabbles and calls for
his impeachment, most prominent politicians now say they will give
the president another chance to bring his administration under
control.
</P>
<P>
   Sarwono said there is no chance now that an impeachment motion
will go forward, as some legislators have warned. ``Nil. Zero. Hot
air,'' he said of the possibility.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a high probability of more hot air. The legislature
is angry, divided, filled with muscle-flexing and political
agendas. There are still 11 days to go before the session ends. The
legislators' turn to take the floor begins on Tuesday.

OSTEOPOROSIS MAY BE DISEASE OF BRAIN AS WELL AS BONE (For use by
NYTimes News Service clients) By JESSIE MILLIGAN c.2000 Fort Worth
Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   The search for a cure for one of the most debilitating diseases
of old age is under way, here in the laboratories of Baylor College
of Medicine in Houston. Outside, nine floors below the urban
multistory medical school, the city is crippled by fractured
streets and sidewalks under repair.
</P>
<P>
   It's an unsettling thought that someday, in the normal course of
the weakening of human bones, the pedestrians scurrying around the
construction outside may not be able to walk at all.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the old streets of Houston, the old human infastructure
cannot be as easily rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   Bone disappears as we age. It becomes less dense, more porous.
Once adult bone is gone, it is gone forever. No one knows how to
rebuild it. At least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Baylor labs, French-born Gerard Karsenty, physician,
professor and researcher, and a team of other scientists are
working on a project that may help us to rebuild our own
infrastructure from the inside out.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor, a detective of sorts, one who tracks missing bone,
says he has discovered that the brain has the power to signal the
skeleton to rebuild itself.
</P>
<P>
   It could be, if Karsenty can figure out how to signal the brain
to rebuild bone, that this discovery may someday lead to a cure for
osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
   Osteoporosis, a gradual loss of bone density as the body ages,
leaves skeletons more fragile and susceptible to fractures,
including debilitating breaks to hips and spines. Karsenty
estimates that 28 million Americans _ particularly thin, elderly
Caucasian and Asian women _ have fragile bones, and of those about
half have become crippled by it.
</P>
<P>
   Although osteoporosis strikes far more women than men, more
whites than blacks, more old than young, the disease shows up
across racial and age lines.
</P>
<P>
   Osteoporosis is insidious, silent. Not many people who have it
even know they do, not until they get a serious fracture. By then,
the bone is gone forever.
</P>
<P>
   All doctors can do now is recommend preventative steps to stop
further bone loss. The National Osteoporosis Foundation says
calcium, vitamin D, weight-bearing exercise and strength training
all prevent bones from degrading. Four medications also are on the
market to prevent further bone loss for those who have been found
to have osteoporosis. Estrogen-replacement therapy is considered
helpful in preventing excessive bone loss in post-menopausal women,
although it carries with it negative side effects such as the
increased risk for breast and uterine cancers.
</P>
<P>
   A cure would help millions. Karsenty is on the path.

   Fifty-two years ago, in France, Gerard Karsenty was born into a
family where medicine is a tradition. His father was an
opthalmologist _ an eye doctor. The younger Karsenty wanted
something more.
</P>
<P>
   ``A physician delivers a treatment. I want to create a
treatment,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   What he wants to do, he says, is study the core of our being,
the very framework that holds everything else together, the very
skeleton that degrades as we age.
</P>
<P>
   He studied medicine at the University of Paris, graduating in
1984. The most prestigious medical research institutions in the
United States saw his promise. As a post-doctoral fellow, he
studied molecular, cellular and nutritional endocrinology at the
National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., and genes at the
National Cancer Institute before moving to the University of Texas
M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston in 1987. In 1998, he moved
to Baylor as a researcher and as a professor, where he teaches the
next generation of doctors about human and molecular genetics.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Karsenty, gray-haired, sturdy of frame, not a top candidate for
osteoporosis himself, has devoted his research to the study of
bones. You can ask him, ``Do you have anyone in your family who has
osteoporosis?'' and he will look at you like he doesn't know how
could you possibly even ask that. And he will say, ``Everyone gets
osteoporosis.'' If they live long enough, he explains, because
eventually bone will break down.
</P>
<P>
   About two years ago, Karsenty decided to link the most
well-known facts about bones and bone loss in a study with his
colleagues at Baylor, scientists Patricia Ducy, Shu Takeda and
Jianhe Shen, as well as five researchers from the University of
Hamburg, Germany, and one from the U.S. National Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   If outlined on a blackboard, their hypothesis would look
something like this:
</P>
<P>
   1. Bone mass is affected by menopause. When the hormone estrogen
is switched off, bones become more breakable.
</P>
<P>
   2. Bone mass is affected by obesity. Fat people are at less of a
risk than thin people. In 1994, the medical community became aware
of a hormone called leptin. Leptin works through the brain to
regulate weight. If we don't have much leptin, we are fat.
</P>
<P>
   Hypothetical questions: If the hormone estrogen affects bone
mass, could the hormone leptin also affect bone mass?
</P>
<P>
   So for about two years, Karsenty and the team _ working in three
separate labs in Texas, Maryland and Germany _ have been studying
mice. About 1,000 of the small rodents, scurrying through the
sawdust in glass aquariumlike cages in the labs, are observed.
</P>
<P>
   They study mice that have no ability to reproduce, and they
study mice that can reproduce. Males and females are studied.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, a former Baylor public affairs employee writes a
press release that says the sterile mice studied are menopausal,
but really, they are not. The mice lack hormones, just as
menopausal women do. But the nonreproducing mice in the study have
been sterile since birth.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers inject leptin into the hypothalamus region of
the mice's brains. By studying mice bones under a microscope, they
discover that when the hormone leptin is present, the bones do not
rebuild. When the hormone leptin is in low supply, the bones get
stronger.
</P>
<P>
   The research represents a milestone, said current Baylor
spokesperson Lynn Foltin. For the first time, scientists can say
that the brain controls bone mass. Bone is not kept strong only by
nutrition, weight-bearing exercise and strength-training. Hormones
affecting our brains also are at work.
</P>
<P>
   The research opens a new door for more researchers to enter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Osteoporosis may be a brain disease as much as it is a bone
disease,'' Karsenty said.
</P>
<P>
   Is this the cure? Not yet. It may be pointing researchers that
way, but there is a big kink to work out.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, it is the roly-poly lab mice that have great
bones.
</P>
<P>
   They are obese little guys, weighing 60 grams instead of the
normal 20 grams.
</P>
<P>
   So the challenge for Karsenty and his team is to figure out how
to regulate leptin without making mice obese. They also must figure
out how the brain sends messages about leptin to the bone.
</P>
<P>
   Studies with humans have not been done. Karsenty said leptin and
bone loss work the same way in mice as they do in people, so he is
confident the results can someday be transferred to human medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Much work remains.
</P>
<P>
   Karsenty's results so far have been reported in the medical
journal Cell, and elsewhere. The study has met with everything from
great joy to great incredulity, he said. But that's the way it is
with discoveries. Not everyone will be happy to be led off into a
new direction. Most osteoporosis research now centers on the impact
of calcium and exercise, not on the impact of hormones regulated by
the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Karsenty will not divulge the amount of money spent on the
research.
</P>
<P>
   He will continue to do more research.
</P>
<P>
   It could take five years, it could take 20 years to complete the
research, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no deadlines in my lab,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So he continues, searching for the way to build bones, the very
frame of our existence.

<P>
   The search for a cure for one of the most debilitating diseases
of old age is under way, here in the laboratories of Baylor College
of Medicine in Houston. Outside, nine floors below the urban
multistory medical school, the city is crippled by fractured
streets and sidewalks under repair.
</P>
<P>
   It's an unsettling thought that someday, in the normal course of
the weakening of human bones, the pedestrians scurrying around the
construction outside may not be able to walk at all.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the old streets of Houston, the old human infastructure
cannot be as easily rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   Bone disappears as we age. It becomes less dense, more porous.
Once adult bone is gone, it is gone forever. No one knows how to
rebuild it. At least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Baylor labs, French-born Gerard Karsenty, physician,
professor and researcher, and a team of other scientists are
working on a project that may help us to rebuild our own
infrastructure from the inside out.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor, a detective of sorts, one who tracks missing bone,
says he has discovered that the brain has the power to signal the
skeleton to rebuild itself.
</P>
<P>
   It could be, if Karsenty can figure out how to signal the brain
to rebuild bone, that this discovery may someday lead to a cure for
osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
   Osteoporosis, a gradual loss of bone density as the body ages,
leaves skeletons more fragile and susceptible to fractures,
including debilitating breaks to hips and spines. Karsenty
estimates that 28 million Americans _ particularly thin, elderly
Caucasian and Asian women _ have fragile bones, and of those about
half have become crippled by it.
</P>
<P>
   Although osteoporosis strikes far more women than men, more
whites than blacks, more old than young, the disease shows up
across racial and age lines.
</P>
<P>
   Osteoporosis is insidious, silent. Not many people who have it
even know they do, not until they get a serious fracture. By then,
the bone is gone forever.
</P>
<P>
   All doctors can do now is recommend preventative steps to stop
further bone loss. The National Osteoporosis Foundation says
calcium, vitamin D, weight-bearing exercise and strength training
all prevent bones from degrading. Four medications also are on the
market to prevent further bone loss for those who have been found
to have osteoporosis. Estrogen-replacement therapy is considered
helpful in preventing excessive bone loss in post-menopausal women,
although it carries with it negative side effects such as the
increased risk for breast and uterine cancers.
</P>
<P>
   A cure would help millions. Karsenty is on the path.

CRITICS NOTEBOOK: BEHIND THE GROSS-OUT HUMOR, THE TEEN-AGE MOVIE IN
HIDING 
</HEADLINE>
   By A.O. SCOTT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the movie box office, like the pop music charts, is ruled by
the taste and purchasing power of high school students, why are
there so few credible representations of adolescent life on today's
movie screens?
</P>
<P>
   The American teen-ager was invented some time in the 1950s, a
cultural byproduct of the baby boom, the rise of the suburbs and
the explosive growth of television and the recording industry. From
the start, the teen-ager was a source of anxiety and an object of
longing _ the vision of a terrifying, amoral future and the image
of an irrecoverably innocent past _ as well as an irresistible
target for marketers of entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The Eisenhower years saw the convening of congressional
committees to assess the dire menace of comic books and the
supposed epidemic of juvenile delinquency. The rise of rock 'n'
roll sparked a culture war that has never really abated through
decades of psychedelia, heavy metal and gangsta rap.
</P>
<P>
   And through it all a lot of grown-ups got rich holding magic
mirrors up to pimply faces, selling young people and the rest of
the world a series of confused, beguiling fantasies about life in
the shopping malls, study halls and dormitories of America.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last half-century, teen-age life has seemed at once
unalterable and ephemeral. Its defining themes _ rebellion against
parental, academic and political authority, sexual and romantic
exploration, wanton irresponsibility and uncompromising idealism _
recur from decade to decade, but the reference points are always
perishable and specific.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing ages faster than youth culture. The pop songs and
fashion statements that define one generation's horizons of
experience quickly appear ridiculous to the children and younger
siblings who follow. (Did you really think that haircut looked
good? How could you listen to that?) But at last the bell-bottoms
and make-out anthems are rescued from the thrift shop shelves and
the cutout bins, rediscovered as retro chic, classic rock and old
school flavor.
</P>
<P>
   The first teen-agers are now grandparents. The cinematic emblems
of their wild youth are either long dead (James Dean, Elvis
Presley) or unrecognizably altered (Marlon Brando, Warren Beatty).
But Hollywood's ambivalent attention to the young and its ardent
courtship of them are perhaps more intense than ever. A summer that
in box office terms seemed to be headed for disappointment a month
ago has been miraculously redeemed, in no small part because of
youthful enthusiasm for ``Scary Movie'' and ``X-Men.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if these movies appeal to young people, neither is
strictly speaking a teen-age movie. Since last summer, a parade of
forgettable prom-date and college-sweetheart romantic comedies has
marched into theaters and almost as quickly marched out again. As
is so often the case, television has done a bit better, offering
watchable prime-time soap operas with a canny, covert
cross-generational appeal. And now, with ``American High'' on Fox,
the nation's insatiable demand for reality-based programming has
met its queasy fascination with the almost grown.
</P>
<P>
   I can't help wondering how many members of the generation
depicted in ``American High,'' R.J. Cutler's documentary series,
will be watching. My suspicion is that a significant segment of the
audience will be people in their 20s and 30s, a group whose morbid
devotion to programs like ``Freaks and Geeks'' and ``My So-Called
Life'' couldn't generate sufficient ratings to save them from
cancellation.
</P>
<P>
   A bit of personal disclosure is in order: I'm one of these
people, and my complaint that there are no good movies out there
for teen-agers may really be an expression of my frustration that
there are no good teen-age movies out there for me. And this
frustration may arise from the fact that my own teen-age years _
the years of my most passionate and indiscriminate consumption of
popular culture _ happened to take place in the 1980s, what should
now be regarded as the golden age of adolescent cinema.
</P>
<P>
   Not that everyone, including me, necessarily thought so at the
time. John Hughes, who produced and directed a string of winsome,
bittersweet comedies in the mid-1980s _ including ``The Breakfast
Club,'' ``Pretty in Pink'' and ``Ferris Bueller's Day Off'' _ was
hardly beloved by serious cinephiles, and he has yet to be given
sufficient credit for updating the elegant studio comedies of the
1930s in the post-production-code, blockbuster-driven Hollywood of
his own era. By then, in any case, the youth picture itself already
seemed formulaic and tired. In 1982, in The New York Times, Janet
Maslin asked, ``Can there be anything about life in high school,
especially high school in a suburban California high school, that
the moviegoing public hasn't already seen?'' This was in a review
of ``Fast Times at Ridgemont High,'' a movie that answered the
question, Maslin acknowledged, with a qualified ``yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Many high school seniors who have been going to licit,
unaccompanied viewings of R-rated movies for less than a year were
born during the first release of ``Ridgemont High,'' and they may
marvel at the aspects of life in high school that the film shows
that the moviegoing public no longer sees. The movie, directed by
Amy Heckerling, is best remembered for starting the film careers of
Sean Penn, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Cameron Crowe, who wrote the
screenplay based on a novel he had written after spending a year at
a suburban California high school and who went on to direct the
fine school-of-John-Hughes romance ``Say Anything'' (as well as
``Jerry Maguire''). But it is most remarkable for its candor about
the sexual lives of its characters.
</P>
<P>
   Stacy Hamilton, the high school junior played by Leigh, loses
her virginity, painfully and half consensually, to a 26-year-old
stereo salesman who doesn't bother to call her again. Later,
pregnant after an unsatisfying encounter with one of her
classmates, she has an abortion, an occurrence almost unimaginable
in the cautious Hollywood of today. But from these grim events,
Heckerling and Crowe managed to conjure a plausible happy ending,
in which Stacy ends up going steady _ but not going all the way _
with the shy, decent Mark Ratner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fast Times at Ridgemont High'' arrived before ``date rape''
and ``secondary virginity'' had entered the lexicon as slogans in
the continuing ideological struggle over the sexuality of young
people, young women in particular. It tackled this delicate subject
without excessive moralism or melodrama. Some of the film's more
graphic and uncompromising scenes were cut, but the movie retains a
feeling of unsentimental honesty that somehow doesn't spoil its
governing spirit of lighthearted comedy.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In the last year or so, movies like ``Election,'' ``Rushmore''
and ``Outside Providence'' have attempted a similar blend of
seriousness and humor, and they have suffered at the box office
despite critical praise. But these are not so much teen-age movies
as movies that use the universality of teen-age experience to tell
delicate, idiosyncratic stories about sexual politics, class
antagonism and the mysteries of desire. ``Election'' and
``Rushmore'' also trotted out two of the icons of '80s teen-movie
bad behavior _ Matthew Broderick of ``Ferris Bueller's Day Off''
and Bill Murray of ``Meatballs'' and ``Caddyshack'' _ and subjected
them to brutal comic debunking. It turns out that Ferris grew up to
be the kind of teacher he loved to torment and that Bill Murray's
smug infantile charm ripened into chastened middle-aged charm.
</P>
<P>
   But where are this year's equivalent movies _ for mature
audiences of any age _ about being young? Since January, alongside
the clockwork release of Freddie Prinze Jr. vehicles (the latest
and weakest of which, ``Boys and Girls,'' is about to reopen, a
last stop on its way to video), a handful of flawed, worthy
examples have come and just as quickly gone, including Sarah
Kernochan's ``All I Wanna Do'' and Colette Burson's ``Coming
Soon,'' which lasted all of a week on a single New York screen.
</P>
<P>
   Burson's sly farce about a high school senior looking for sexual
satisfaction was evidently too hot for the big studios or the MPAA
to handle. The display of semen to comic effect _ most recently and
explosively evident in ``Scary Movie'' _ is permissible, but frank
discussion of female orgasm remains taboo. A strange hypocrisy
about sex _ too complex and involuted to be a simple double
standard _ haunts the culture. The most interesting youth movies _
``Road Trip'' (featuring MTV star Tom Green), ``Loser'' (uniting
Jason Biggs from ``American Pie'' with Mena Suvari from ``American
Beauty'') and even ``Scary Movie'' in addition to the more serious
ones I've mentioned _ at least engage this hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   The equation of sex with other bodily functions _ its reduction
to the level of scatology _ isn't so much an assault on taboos as a
way of evading them. Strange sensations and scary emotions are
neutralized by being made occasions for infantile humor. ``Scary
Movie'' tries to make its audiences feel safe by turning male
sexual anxiety _ about being straight or gay, about the adequacy of
one's equipment _ into occasions for unembarrassed laughter. ``Road
Trip,'' with unlikely grace, balances this kind of comedy with the
old-fashioned romantic kind and even manages to respect its female
characters (despite its propensity for showing them stripped down
to their underwear).
</P>
<P>
   Is there any place for a teen-age romantic comedy that
illuminates the risk and absurdity of sexual initiation without the
protection of gross-out humor? Heckerling's new film, ``Loser,''
makes an attempt, but the brave realism and satiric accuracy that
distinguished both ``Fast Times at Ridgemont High'' and
``Clueless,'' Heckerling's 1996 updating of Jane Austen's ``Emma,''
seem to have deserted her _ or else to have been taken away. There
are glimpses of the danger that haunted Ridgemont High: the heroine
works as a waitress in a sleazy strip club, and the foppish
fraternity-boy villains keep a stash of roofies, or date rape
pills. But the movie skitters away from its darker implications and
ends up hovering in a confused limbo between romance and satire
rather than achieving equipoise between them.
</P>
<P>
   But 10 or 15 years from now, everything may look different,
which is to say, nothing may have changed. ``Loser'' and
``Election'' may have found their way into the home-viewing canon
of wistful 30-year-olds who stare in mute incomprehension at what
the kids are watching and think, Where are the teen-age movies for
me today? Where is my so-called life?

THE ENDURING APPEAL OF THE CANADIAN ROCKIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, August 13)  
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the genteel days of railroad tourism, the Canadian Rockies
had predictable, limited flows of visitors who came to gawk at
dramatic mountain crags that were marketed around the world as the
second Switzerland. But now Banff National Park, the oldest park in
Canada's system, has a busy, largely four-lane highway transecting
it and an international airport only 90 minutes away, in Calgary.
Flying to Calgary from Tokyo or piloting motor homes from Michigan,
an estimated 4.4 million people visit the park every year, with
another 4 million indulging in what park officials call
``windshield tourism'' as they drive through on the Trans-Canada
Highway.
</P>
<P>
   In the peak days in July and August, the population of Banff can
easily quadruple from its year-round population of 7,000. ``It's
like a wall of metal,'' Pamela L. Veinotte, a Parks Canada tourism
manager, said of the lines of recreational vehicles that wind up
one mountain road to a major attraction, Moraine Lake, where still
waters are framed by granite peaks.

   Even with high gasoline prices, the American tourist crush is
not expected to abate this summer. Canada is a travel bargain as
the American dollar fetches almost $1.50 Canadian. Even if Air
Canada pilots conduct a slowdown or go on strike this month over
pay and working issues stemming from the airline's ongoing merger
with Canadian Airlines, there are alternatives. U.S. carriers offer
direct flights linking Calgary with major American cities _
Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, Salt Lake City and
San Francisco. With a North American open skies agreement that
began to take effect five years ago, the number of Americans flying
to Canada increased by almost 60 percent during the 1990s, putting
Canada on a par with Britain as Americans' favorite air travel
destination after Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   To cope with this summer's crowds at Canada's most heavily
visited park, planners have taken new steps to induce
recreational-vehicle drivers to take shuttle buses, to reduce
conflicts between tourists and wildlife and to cut down on the
herds of tourists tromping through Chateau Lake Louise, the
venerable resort hotel on the edge of the emerald lake.
</P>
<P>
   Starting last June, visitors have had the option of riding free
shuttle buses between the Lake Louise Campground and Lake Louise
and between the campground and Lake Moraine. Although passers-by
may hail the buses, priority is given to drivers of recreational
vehicles. As North American baby boomers age, park officials have
detected an increase in motor homes and a decrease in back country
camping.
</P>
<P>
   Also in June, managers at Chateau Lake Louise began to put much
of the 488-room hotel off limits to nonguests, with the exception
of the eight restaurants and a shopping arcade. Guests, some of
whom were paying $250 a night for a room, had long complained of
tourists filling up easy chairs in the hotel's famous Lakeview
lounge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the crowds _ people were paying a premium rate for a
world-class experience for Lake Louise and were not getting it,''
Janet Eger, the hotel's director of public relations, said of the
new restrictions on public access.
</P>
<P>
   Tourist encounters with bears, elk and wolves have long been a
problem along the park's central valley and the park's two towns,
Banff and Lake Louise. After tourists were injured by elk during
calving season in the spring and rutting season in the fall, park
officials moved last winter to relocate about two-thirds of Banff's
elk population of 400 animals to remote park areas. Two small herds
remain and are easily visible off the eastern edge of town, around
the city golf course.
</P>
<P>
   ``The locals notice the amount of flowers that are not eaten at
night,'' said Dennis R. Shuler, Banff's part-time mayor. To
minimize conflicts with grizzlies, park officials have cracked down
on bird feeders, on the grounds they attract bears, have
temporarily closed some campgrounds and trails, and have harassed
bears with noisemakers to teach them to stay away from humans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At Moraine Lake, where several trails were closed in past
summers because of grizzlies in the area, the park is experimenting
with allowing hikers to go out in groups of six or more, on the
theory that there is greater safety in numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Wardens patrol the Bow Valley Parkway, an unfenced valley road
that parallels the Trans-Canada Highway, looking for ``bear jams,''
or traffic backups in front of bears and other wildlife. One road
section now has a temporary speed limit of 20 miles an hour because
a wolf litter was spotted near the road in early June. After a
cougar attacked and injured a loose dog near Banff in April,
wardens increased warnings to visitors to keep dogs on leashes.
</P>
<P>
   Although hotels in the park offer 8,800 beds, space tightens in
the peak season of July and August. In May, the neighboring town of
Cranmore closed off one loophole, passing a law that forbids
homeowners from renting their homes for periods of less than 28
days. In illustration of how tourism pressure is spilling out of
the park, Cranmore now fines illegal tourist homes up to $3,000 _
more than double the fines for unauthorized logging.

 &HT;    Lieberman selected over five others as Gore's running mate
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Al Gore has selected Connecticut Sen. Joseph Lieberman to be his
running mate, rounding out the Democratic ticket with the first
Jewish vice presidential candidate in American history. Gore
offered Lieberman the job in a telephone call Monday, and Lieberman
accepted. Picking the moderate Democrat and self-styled moral
crusader as his running mate signals an effort by Gore to win over
independent and Republican voters and distance himself from
President Clinton's controversies. Lieberman, 58, beat out five
other finalists: Sens. Evan Bayh of Indiana, John Edwards of North
Carolina, John Kerry of Massachusetts; House Minority Leader Dick
Gephardt of Missouri and New Hampshire Gov. Jeanne Shaheen.
</P>
<P>
   FORGIVE AND FORGET
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton praised Sen. Joseph Lieberman as a longtime
friend and innovative thinker, but did not mention Lieberman's
stern criticism of his behavior in the Monica Lewinsky affair. ``I
think he's one of the most outstanding people in public life,''
Clinton said. In August 1998, when most senators were steering
clear of comment on the Lewinsky sex scandal, Lieberman stunned the
White House by calling Clinton's behavior ``immoral'' in a speech
from the Senate floor. Lieberman's speech helped open the way for
an impeachment process that eventually ended in the president's
acquittal. In the end, Lieberman voted with the president.
</P>
<P>
   THE GLOVES COME OFF EVEN BEFORE CALL COMES IN
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman wasted no time in going after the
Republican presidential ticket -- blasting its nominees even before
being officially asked to be the Democratic vice presidential
nominee. The official announcement will come today. Addressing
union members at an AFL-CIO event in Hartford before Al Gore called
to offer him the slot, Lieberman tagged the Bush-Cheney ticket a
far-right pairing. He said the Republicans would recklessly spend
budget surpluses built up under the leadership of President Clinton
and Gore and make massive tax cuts that would leave no money for
Medicare, defense or education. ``If that is their idea of
compassion, I'd hate to see their idea of contempt,'' Lieberman
said.
</P>
<P>
   YOU WIN SOME, YOU LOSE SOME
</P>
<P>
   Under Connecticut law, Joseph Lieberman can run for both vice
president and his third term in the Senate. His re-election has
seemed all but sure: A recent Quinnipiac University poll showed
Lieberman supported by 71 percent of respondents, compared with 14
percent for Republican challenger Philip Giordano, the mayor of
Waterbury. But if the Democratic ticket wins the White House and
Lieberman also wins re-election, he will have to resign his Senate
seat. It would fall to Republican Gov. John G. Rowland to appoint
someone to fill the seat, affecting Democratic efforts to regain
control of the Senate, where the Republicans now hold a 54-46
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   BOUNCE OR TROUNCE?
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush has jumped into a 17 percentage point lead over
Al Gore, reaping a 13-point bounce from last week's Republican
convention, according to a Reuters/Zogby poll released today. The
poll of 1,000 likely voters found Bush winning 49 percent of the
vote, and Gore polling 32 percent. Ralph Nader won 6 percent;
Reform Party hopeful Pat Buchanan scored 1 percent and the rest
were undecided or favored others. The statistical margin of error
was plus or minus 3.2 percent. However, on a historical note of
caution, Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis led Bush's father, then
Vice President George Bush, by 17 points after the 1988 Democratic
convention but Bush wound up winning the election easily.
</P>
<P>
   ONE JOE ON THE TICKET, REGULAR JOES ON STAGE
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles next week will
showcase working Americans, their daily struggles and the issues
important to them, party officials said today. In a departure from
the usual political speeches, the convention will feature half-hour
panel discussions with three-to-six participants. Dubbed ``American
Dialogues,'' the discussions will be moderated by a prominent
Democrat each night and highlight everyday issues such as health
care, education, crime, retirement and middle-class tax cuts, among
others. Doug Hattaway, a campaign spokesman for Al Gore, said
George W. Bush is giving voters ``cotton candy and we're giving
them real nutrition.''
</P>
<P>
   THEY HAD GEORGE P., WE'VE GOT FORD JR.
</P>
<P>
   Forget Mario M. Cuomo or Ann Richards, keynoters of conventions
past. The main speaker for the Democratic convention will be a
30-year-old congressman from Memphis who is virtually unknown in
national politics. Meet Harold E. Ford Jr., who, in 1996, became
the youngest member of Congress when he won the seat that had been
held by his father_Tennessee's first African -American congressman.
Ford said his 15 to 20 minute speech will be ``positive, uplifting
and forward-looking.''
</P>
<P>
   THE STATE OF THE UNION MEETS THE ACADEMY AWARDS
</P>
<P>
   With the presidential nomination all but certain, the real
pressure for the delgates attending the convention will be to snag
invites to the A-list parties. The hosts are under pressure too,
competing to get Hollywood's top television and movie stars to turn
out for their public gala or private gathering. A $1,000 donation
to Hillary Clinton's Senate campaign will allow donors to party
with her, the president and the likes of Stevie Wonder, Toni
Braxton, Cher and Melissa Etheridge. For another $24,000, donors
can stay for dinner and hear Michael Douglas, Shirley MacLaine,
John Travolta, and civil rights leader Rosa Parks pay tribute.
Barbara Streisand will hold a $1,000 a-head Al Gore fundraiser. And
of course there's the most controversial of all parties: the
Hispanic Unity PAC fund-raiser at the Playboy mansion. Gore is not
attending the event and reportedly asked organizer Rep. Loretta
Sanchez of California to cancel it.
</P>
<P>
   AS IF THEY NEEDED ANY MORE
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush and Dick Cheney will receive $67.56 million in
public funds for the general election, the Federal Election
Commission announced. Bush and Cheney requested the money after
receiving their party's nomination at the convention last week.
Under election law, major party nominees are entitled to federal
funding for the general election if they agree to national spending
limits. They may spend no more than the public funding plus a
combined total $50,000 from their personal funds. The candidates
may also raise money from supporters for legal and accounting
expenses, subject to FEC rules. The Democratic ticket of Al Gore
and Joseph Lieberman will be eligible for federal money after the
party's convention in Los Angeles next week.
</P>
<P>
   GOP DIPS INTO PIGGY BANK
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party is launching a $100 million campaign that
will dwarf the spending of George W. Bush and Al Gore in an effort
to get indifferent voters to go to the polls in November. Victory
2000 targets wavering citizens_over the air, on the phone, in the
mail and on doorsteps_in hopes of boosting turnout among those who
seem most likely to come down on the side of Bush and other GOPers.
In '96 and '98, Democrats and their union allies did a better job
of turning out their most reliable voters than did Republicans. But
this year, with evidence that the Republican base is already more
than 90 percent committed to Bush and eager to oust the Democrats
from the White House, the GOP is investing an unprecedented
treasury in going after the undecided and the weak partisans.
</P>
<P>
   THE CHOICE IS CLEAR: VOTE FOR ME OR PERISH
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan, who heads to the Reform Party's nominating
convention this week without a running mate or the assurance that
he will survive an attempt to throw him off the ballot, said he is
sure to win the Party nomination and declared the fractured third
party will die if he doesn't gain the nod. ``If I don't get this
nomination, it is pretty much the end of the Reform Party,'' he
said. Buchanan, a former TV commentator who left the Republican
Party, predicted he would win the overwhelming majority of
delegates at the convention that begins Thursday in Long Beach,
Calif. The Reform Party that Dallas billionaire Ross Perot built
has split into pro- and anti-Buchanan factions.
</P>
<P>
   PRESIDENT WORRIES AL WILL GET GORED
</P>
<P>
   Some might expect a lame-duck president to assume the role of
political cheerleader, but at the moment President Clinton sounds
more like a coach worried that his team is trailing at halftime.
Wrapping up a speech at a fund-raiser on Cape Cod, the president
warned Democrats, ``Don't blow this election.'' It was the latest
in a series of wary comments he has made about the general
election. Clinton has also complained about polls showing that Al
Gore gets little credit for the nation's booming economy. The
concerns have been expressed in unscripted settings, such as
evening fund-raisers and news interviews. He has never publicly
said that he believes the Gore campaign is in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   FOR DAD, MUM'S THE WORD
</P>
<P>
   Former President George Bush admitted he went too far when he
threatened last week to tell Americans what he thought about
President Clinton. The former president had warned that he would
drop a self-imposed ban on criticizing Clinton if the current
occupant of the White House continued attacks on Bush's son, George
W. Bush. Clinton, who defeated the elder Bush in the 1992
presidential race, recently said Bush's son was running only
because ``daddy was president.'' Bush responded by saying, ``I'm
going to wait a month... If he continues that, I'm going to tell
the nation what I think about him as a human being and person.''
But in a Time magazine interview, Bush said his response was
inappropriate. ``I went too far,'' he said. ``That's it. I'm not
going to say any more.''
</P>
<P>
   MAYBE 'SLICK WILLIE' WAS ON TO SOMETHING
</P>
<P>
   George and Al take note: A team of psychologists has determined
that great presidents are ``not above tricking, cajoling, bullying,
or lying if necessary. They are politicians playing the right tune
to each crowd.'' That's the conclusion of three reserachers, who
made their presentation to the American Psychological Association.
For their study, the researchers consulted with 115 presidential
historians who helped rate the nation's 41 presidents on a complex,
600-question psychological scale. The psychologists found that the
best presidents were extroverted, assertive and slightly
disorganized.

ONE CRUISE WITH A TASTE OF 3 NATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, August 13)  
 (Editors: See also TRAVEL-LAKE-SUPERIOR, TRAVEL-LAKE-ERIE)  
 By DONNA MARCHETTI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   I am a sucker for the Great Lakes.
I vacation on them. I swim in them. I walk their beaches and scuba
dive in them. I even live on one _ Lake Erie. But one of the few
things I'd never done on the Great Lakes was take a cruise.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Great Lakes passenger ships have a long and venerable history.
In the days before cars and planes, when ships offered the most
exciting way to get somewhere, vacationers from Cleveland, Buffalo,
Chicago and Milwaukee regularly boarded vessels that took them to
resort towns. Many of these ships boasted a level of luxury that
rivaled oceangoing liners. Very few of these historic vessels
remain; the once-beautiful Keewatin, now a museum on Lake Michigan,
is in a sad state of disrepair.
</P>
<P>
   It took Europeans to revive interest in passenger ships on the
Great Lakes: In 1997 the Columbus was built in Germany specifically
to navigate the Great Lakes. The 472-foot cruise ship sails all
over the world, spending winters in tropical locales like the
Caribbean or the South Pacific. But in the summer it comes back to
the lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Owned by a German company, Hapag-Lloyd, the Columbus is
chartered each year by one or more American companies for Great
Lakes cruises.
</P>
<P>
   The Columbus began selling its cruises mostly to Germans; in
1998 one trip was opened to North Americans. Last year there were
three, and when I heard about them, I vowed to be on board for one.
</P>
<P>
   Time and money constraints led me to choose the shortest of the
three (each of the other cruises was 10 days). My three-night,
four-day jaunt, operated under charter by by the Great Lakes Cruise
Co., would embark from Windsor, Ontario, travel up the Detroit
River, then into Lake St. Clair, up the St. Clair River to the top
of Lake Huron and back, debarking at Detroit. (Because of U.S. and
Canadian maritime laws regarding foreign-owned ships, we had to
embark from one country and debark in the other.) The ship was
scheduled to stop at Manitoulin Island in Ontario and Mackinac
Island, Mich. The cruise was set for the first week of October,
just in time, the brochure said, to catch the fall colors at their
height.
</P>
<P>
   Originally I thought I would be alone. I booked a double outside
cabin with a ``partially obstructed view.'' It was smaller than the
other outside cabins and almost $200 less expensive because of the
obstruction and reduced size. Several months later, when my sister,
Carol, told me she would be able to join me, I had completely
forgotten about the small cabin with the partial view.
</P>
<P>
   We boarded the ship on a Saturday in Windsor at pretty Dieppe
Park (taking a $30 cab ride from just across the river in Detroit,
where we had left our car after driving from Cleveland). We were
immediately ushered into the dining room for lunch while our cabins
were being prepared. It was the first of many delightful meals:
perfectly poached salmon drizzled with cucumber dill sauce, tiny
roasted potatoes. German wine and beer flowed freely.
</P>
<P>
   Capable of carrying 418 passengers and a crew of 170, the
Columbus is beautifully appointed and well maintained. Numerous
times over the short cruise we saw crew members on hands and knees,
scrubbing tiny spots off the carpet or sprucing up chrome.
</P>
<P>
   Though small by cruise ship standards, the Columbus has many of
the features you would expect on an oceangoing ship: lovely public
sitting areas with beautiful views, a cozy wine bar, a small
exercise room facing the water, a library, lounge, large dining
room, sauna, hair salon, boutique, lots of deck space, a swimming
pool, and a good-size hall for shows and the lectures on Great
Lakes history that took place throughout the cruise.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the ship left the dock, a light drizzle was falling
and the Detroit skyline passed in a soggy blur. Spirits were high,
though, as we continued on our way, waving to people on pleasure
boats and to crews on freighters that passed close by. Though the
cruise was completely booked, and most passengers were on deck for
the departure, we didn't feel crowded then or any time later on the
trip.
</P>
<P>
   Rain finally drove us to our cabin, where we discovered that our
``partially obstructed view'' consisted entirely of a 150-person
lifeboat-tender perched just outside our cabin. It was possible, we
learned through experimentation, to sit on about a square-foot area
of one of the berths and catch a glimpse of a six-inch sliver of
water.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, we were quite satisfied with our cabin, small but
still roomy enough to be comfortable. The space had been well
planned _ there was plenty of storage, a substantial bathroom with
vanity and shower, two comfy berths and a table and chair. Other
amenities included a minibar, safe, telephone, TV, good reading
lights and cabin temperature control. Chocolate-covered
strawberries provided a nice touch, as did a fresh flower. My
favorite part, though, was the fluffy European-style down-filled
comforter and pillow.
</P>
<P>
   We found, in fact, many European touches to the ship _ most of
them pleasant, a couple inconvenient. The food had a subtle
European elegance, and was always well executed. The restaurant
opened exactly as scheduled and other events like lectures and the
nightly musical entertainment also began promptly. On the down
side: although the mostly European crew spoke English, some were
more fluent than others, and small misunderstandings often
occurred. All prices on board _ in the gift shop and on the
restaurant's beverage list _ were in marks, the cause of endless
head scratching among our four table mates.
</P>
<P>
   We missed the predinner cocktail hour that first night, enjoying
ourselves instead with champagne in our cabin (we brought our own;
there was only the minibar, no cabin service), speculating on the
view beyond our lifeboat. Dinner for me was salad with delicate
truffle-cream dressing, a delicious couscous-stuffed eggplant and
for dessert, a small plate of European cheeses. I was grateful for
the daily vegetarian selection at both lunch and dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Later that evening we ventured onto the deck, but a cold wind
was blowing with a ferocity that held portents for the coming
night. I awoke at 1:30 a.m. to feel the boat pitching and creaking
with far more vehemence than I thought possible for a large boat on
a lake, at one point slamming down on the water with a thud that
set the whole place shuddering.
</P>
<P>
   By morning the storm had passed, the water was calm and we could
see sunlight peeking in from around our window shade.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Eager to see the sun, I opened the shade, still in my
nightshirt, and found myself face-to-face with an equally startled
crew member working on the tender.
</P>
<P>
   At noon we anchored off Manitoulin Island near the picturesque
town of Little Current, population 1,600. From the water the island
appeared almost uninhabited, covered with forests of pine and
hardwood just beginning to turn colors. At more than 80 miles long
and from 2 to 40 miles wide, Manitoulin Island is often billed as
the world's largest freshwater island, though there is apparently a
larger island in the Amazon River delta (which may at times,
presumably, be brackish, but we're splitting hairs). There are more
than 100 inland lakes on Manitoulin, some of them with their own
islands.
</P>
<P>
   The island's name comes from ``Manitou'' or ``Great Spirit'' in
the language of the Algonquin group of American Indian tribes that
lived throughout the Upper Great Lakes when the Europeans began to
arrive in the 1600s and 1700s. Many descendants of the first Indian
inhabitants live today on Manitoulin _ about a quarter of the
island's 12,000 residents. The economy is based primarily on
farming, lumbering, fishing, livestock raising and _ increasingly _
tourism.
</P>
<P>
   We had signed up for an excursion advertised as an Ojibwe dance
and drum group performance, though it proved to be more. After
boarding buses in Little Current, we were driven about eight miles
to West Bay, also known by its Indian name, M'Chigeeng. There we
received a brief introduction to Ojibwe culture by Chief Glen Hare,
followed by a tour of the Ojibwe Cultural Foundation, which houses
many works by local artists as well as artifacts and museum pieces.
</P>
<P>
   But the high point of the day was a powwow in an outdoor arena
nearby. The crisp fall air smelled of pine and wood smoke, and
colorful leaves glowed against a sky just beginning to cloud. We
watched as dancers, mostly teen-age boys and girls, performed their
traditional dances accompanied by musicians and singers. Especially
fascinating was a hoop dancer, who maneuvered about two dozen hoops
to create shapes of things in nature _ a bird, a butterfly emerging
from its cocoon, a flower. At the end of the performance, the
audience was invited to participate, adding a celebratory note to
the day.
</P>
<P>
   The ship left Manitoulin just as the sun was setting and sailed
through the night to Mackinac Island, which took 13 hours at a
deliberately leisurely pace. Once again the day dawned bright and
sunny, though a chilly 40 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   We were on the first tender at 8 a.m., when the slanting sun
shone golden on that beautiful island.
</P>
<P>
   What many people associate with the island, the name of which is
pronounced MAC-uh-naw, are the things that are immediately
noticeable to tourists. The lack of motorized vehicles, by order of
a turn-of-the-century edict, means that all nonemergency
transportation _ even for deliveries _ is accomplished by horse or
bicycle. The island is known for its fudge stands and souvenir
shops, and perhaps most famous for the elegant Grand Hotel, the
setting for the 1980 movie ``Somewhere in Time.''
</P>
<P>
   But the island is steeped in history that goes further back than
tourism. Its strategic location in the Straits of Mackinac, where
Lakes Huron and Michigan join, and only a short distance from Lake
Superior, put it at the crossroads for voyageurs, traders and the
British and American military. Fort Mackinac, in a stunning
location overlooking the water, was built by the British in 1780-81
but was later ceded to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Because I had visited the island twice during the summer before
the cruise and had done the usual tourist activities, we decided to
try something a bit different and explore the island on horseback.
We stopped by Cindy's Riding Stable, hired horses and a guide and
went off for a ride in the cold, clear morning. We sauntered over
wooded trails up to the highest point of the island, the ruins of
Fort Holmes, from whose vantage point the British had retaken Fort
Mackinac during the War of 1812. From there we had a spectacular
view of the harbor below and our ship anchored to the east. To the
west was the Mackinac Bridge, one of the world's longest suspension
bridges, which connects Michigan's lower and upper peninsulas.
</P>
<P>
   Back on the ship, it was lunchtime, with some people in the
dining room, and the rest enjoying a lively Oktoberfest on the deck
by the pool. Sausages, sauerkraut, pretzels and beer were being
savored in the chilly air, while a few hardy passengers played in
the heated pool, beers in hand. The ship pulled up anchor just
after lunch and sailed under the bridge, the top of the stacks
appearing to brush its bottom. We turned around and passed under it
again, then headed south to Detroit, where we would get off the
next morning.
</P>
<P>
   The all-too-brief cruise was what I had hoped for _ relaxing and
elegant yet casual, against a backdrop of subtly gorgeous scenery
that has long held special appeal for me. The only thing I would do
differently were I to sail again on the Columbus: spend the money
for a full view, leaving the close encounter with a lifeboat for an
emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ALL THE COMFORTS: Booking a Cruise
</P>
<P>
   I arranged the cruise aboard the Columbus from Windsor, Ontario,
to Detroit through the Great Lakes Cruise  &UR; Co. &LR; , 3270 Washtenaw
Avenue, Ann Arbor, Mich. 48104; (734) 477-6045, fax (734) 677-3128;
www.greatlakescruiseco.com.
</P>
<P>
   My sister and I drove from Cleveland to Detroit, where we left
our car in a downtown parking garage. We took a taxi to Dieppe Park
in Windsor, Ontario. United States and Canadian maritime laws
require the Columbus to depart from a different city from the one
it returns to. This was not an inconvenience because Windsor and
Detroit are a 15-minute taxi ride apart. Some itineraries require
more complicated arrangements, which must be made by the passenger.
</P>
<P>
   Our double cabin was $682 a person, including meals, lectures
and entertainment aboard ship, tips and port taxes. We also paid
$34 each for the ship's tour to an Ojibwe powwow on Manitoulin
Island.
</P>
<P>
   During our stop on Mackinac Island, we went horseback riding on
our own at Cindy's Riding Stable, on Market Street, (906) 847-3572,
at a cost of $25 a person for the first hour, $20 for each
additional hour, including a guide.

<P>
   This year, the Great Lakes Cruise Co. will offer cruises on the
Columbus and Le Levant, a 330-foot luxury yacht built in France in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Columbus, owned by Hapag-Lloyd, will sail Sept. 13 for a
10-day Great Lakes Odyssey that will begin in Windsor, Ontario, and
end in Chicago, with stops at Tobermory, Sault Ste. Marie and
Thunder Bay in Ontario; Duluth, Minn.; Marquette, Mackinac Island
and Traverse City, Mich.; and Manitowoc, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   Double cabins range from $1,722 to $3,299 per person. Suites
range from $3,382 to $3,747 per person, double occupancy. Single
cabins are $3,0135 to $5,773. Although all meals are included,
gratuities no longer are; beverages and shore trips also are extra.
</P>
<P>
   Le Levant, owned by Compagnie des Iles du Ponant in Nantes,
France, will next sail on Sept. 23. The weeklong cruise will begin
in Toronto and end at Chicago, with stops at Niagara Falls,
Windsor, Manitoulin Island and Sault Ste. Marie in Ontario, and
Mackinac Island and Saugatuck, Mich. Per person rates for double
occupancy cabins range from $3,725 to $5,425. All staterooms are
outside cabins. Single cabins are $6,519 to $9,494. Rates include
many items the Columbus' fares do not, like one night in a luxury
Toronto hotel before sailing, all shore excursions, wine at lunch
and dinner, some meals at ports of call and tips.
</P>
<P>
   In 2001, Great Lakes Cruise Co. will offer two weeklong sailings
on Le Levant and four weeklong cruises on the Columbus. Fares will
range from $1,098 to $4,696 a person, double, on the Columbus and
$4,043 to $5,801 on Le Levant, with discounts for booking before
Dec. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Another addition to Great Lakes cruising will begin with the
2001 season. The 367-foot Arcadia, owned by Golden Sun, a Greek
company, will offer 24 sailings with 11 itineraries, ranging from
three nights to seven. Most begin in Windsor and end in Detroit.
The ship, which has a Greek and North American crew, was built in
1969 and refurbished in 1989. It has undergone several upgrades
since then. Prices per person, double occupancy, range from $430 to
$1,795. Contact Great Lakes Cruises, 217 Wisconsin Avenue,

THE JOYS OF THE FULL ENGLISH BREAKFAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, August 13)  
 By ALAN COWELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not as if we had a secret hankering for cholesterol. But,
often as not, like Mount Everest _ and in more ways than one _ it
was simply there. I'm talking, of course, about the Full English
Breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   My brother, David, and I had chosen to vacation with our
youngest children in the Lake District, retracing youthful
footsteps in places where the very mention of our boyhood escapades
(``See that rock face? Well, we climbed that,'' etc.) produced
either knowing exchanges of rolled eyes between our offspring or _
yet more of a put-down _ a studious page-turning in their
undeclared competition to be first to finish the latest Harry
Potter.
</P>
<P>
   Much to the relief of my youngest daughter, Rebecca, 12, and
nephew Ted, 11, we had chosen accommodations from a guide to
Britain's best bed-and-breakfast establishments rather than the
faux-nostalgia of flapping canvas and off-putting sanitary
arrangements associated with a camping holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Very quickly we discovered that things had moved on in the B&AMP;B
world, at least in the places listed in our guidebook, and at least
when judged by distant memories of impromptu overnight halts with
our own parents. En suite bathrooms had become de rigueur _ a
marked departure from the days of chilly expeditions across
unfamiliar corridors in quest of the facilities. Residents' lounges
and television sets, too, were no longer unusual. Some places even
offered evening meals and wine lists, with reservations and maps
available on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing had not changed: the idea that the day cannot be
started adequately without the ingestion of mountains of food. Not
just any food. This being the northwest of England, the usual
attributes of a Full English _ fried bacon, fried eggs, fried
mushrooms, fried tomatoes _ were complemented by chunks of
Cumberland sausage (a spicier, meatier variant on the less muscular
southern sausage) or black pudding, a close relative of the German
Blutwurst, or blood sausage. Fried bread and baked beans were
offered as optional extras for those craving just that extra little
something to titillate the palate. Cereals were mere hors
d'oeuvres. Buttered toast and jam provided a kind of dessert.
</P>
<P>
   Far more than breakfast in a New York diner with its
pick-and-mix perils of hash browns and muffins and eggs over easy,
the Full English comes as a complete package. Like a cigarette
pack, it should be served with the equivalent of a surgeon
general's warning: this breakfast will damage your relationship
with the bathroom scales, at the very least.
</P>
<P>
   As Nancy Reagan counseled, we could have said no. But we didn't,
and neither did any of the other guests we greeted as they came to
grips _ sometimes with a furtive delight, like children at a
midnight feast _ with this most British of offerings. Somehow, the
dietary prescriptions, the regime of juice and muesli and herbal
tea, all fell away. Somehow, the slightly forced oohs and aahs and
I'll-never-eat-all-of-its that greeted the arrival of each serving
gave way to determined assaults and plates wiped clean.
</P>
<P>
   The most remarkable thing of all is that this meal, this
sceptered dish, this Full English bears no relation at all to what
most people in England eat for breakfast. Its title is a marketing
device, an extension of the branding of England that seeks to
persuade visitors that the English are all ruddy-cheeked,
tweed-clad, hearty types who live in Tudor cottages and sometimes
dress in bizarre but colorful medieval uniforms. Its basic
assumption is that England is still a rural country where chicken
and pigs are reared to provide sustenance for bucolic yeomen.
</P>
<P>
   In the frenzy of modern England, particularly in the driven
southeast around London, very few people have the time or the
inclination to gird themselves with skillet and cooking oil to
prepare breakfast even as they shower, scan their stock prices,
recharge their cell phones and brace for the subway. Increasingly,
breakfast-time eateries (with some notable exceptions) are far more
likely to offer lattes and cappuccinos and croissants than mugs of
sweet, milky tea and latherings of dubious pork products.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in B&AMP;Bs and hotels across the land, the Full English
endures. Why? Not simply because it's there, as the mountaineer
George Leigh Mallory said of Mount Everest. But because it wasn't
always there for everybody.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, for instance, that Britain's baby boomers grew up in
the shadow of food-rationing after the Second World War, when eggs
and bacon were prized rarities. Their forebears lived through two
world wars and the intervening depression. In Victorian times,
particularly in the industrial north, the Full English might have
been served from the chafing dishes in the toffs' dining room,
along with grilled kidneys, kippers and kedgeree, but for the
toiling masses, bread and lard was a more likely breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   There is something faintly decadent about sitting down to a meal
that may well be completely unnecessary. But the Full English is so
quintessentially English because of its association of prosperity
with plenty: eat at any roadside pub or restaurant in middle
England and you soon discover that the size of the serving really
does matter, and not just at breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   It is inconceivable that, say, an Italian breakfaster (with the
same distant memories of wartime hardship) would gorge on extra
cornetti when one cornetto (croissant) suffices, grazie. Yet, on
the way back from the Lake District, when we rewarded our children
for tolerating our recherche du temps perdu with a visit to the
huge amusement park called Alton Towers, the meals on offer along
the byways of the English Midlands included chicken tikka masala
with fries, lasagne verde with fries and pizza Margherita with
fries.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is only so much anthropology to be squeezed
from a breakfast, however Full or English it may be.
</P>
<P>
   In the Lake District, surrounded by soaring crags and distant,
rugged peaks, it was easy enough to justify the excess: after all,
we had hills to climb, streams to ford, memories to recount, B&AMP;Bs
to reach before nightfall. We would need solid fare to sustain us.
</P>
<P>
   As we checked into our last B&AMP;B before the amusement park in the
Midlands, the owner ventured that, considering the vertiginous
rides ahead of us, we might prefer a lighter breakfast _ a
half-English, or quarter-English even: toast and tea, fruit juice
and cereal. We assented with something like relief _ and perhaps a
premonition that end-of-vacation reality was about to reclaim us to
a more frugal world.

 &HT;    42 flavors, no whining
 &HT;    By Sofia Villalobos
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EATON, Ohio _ Sour apple, cinnamon, root beer or mint chocolate
_ choose a flavor. Parents can take a vacation from tantrums and
screeching cries since pharmacist-technician Kenneth Kramm invented
Flavorx _ 42 flavors to cover the bitter taste of some prescribed
and over-the-counter liquid medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most popular flavors are bubblegum, cherry and grape,''
said Edee Gosnell, a registered pharmacist and owner of Medicap
Pharmacy in Eaton.
</P>
<P>
   Used to cover even the most brutal antibiotic, the concoction
isn't quite as popular as it could be, but the solution's
popularity is beginning to grow. ``We have posters and
advertisements telling customers they can bring their medication
and have it flavored for $3,'' Gosnell said.
</P>
<P>
   Just like an ice cream shop, a large menu hangs from the ceiling
for customers to choose and even try their preferred gusto. The
concoction is easy to swallow but doesn't taste like candy. ``It
makes the medicine more palatable but not so good that a child
would want to drink the entire bottle,'' said Gosnell.
</P>
<P>
   According to his Web site at www.flavorx.com, Kramm and his
father began experimenting with the flavors because Kramm's
daughter, Hadley, who was diagnosed with cerebral palsy as an
infant, would gag and even vomit her medication. If she did not
absorb the proper amounts of medicine, Hadley would suffer
seizures.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington, D.C., resident says his daughter's condition has
stabilized since she has been able to consume the proper
medication.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, Kroger pharmacies began offering Flavorx,
charging $3 a shot. ``But not all 42 flavors can be mixed with just
any medication,'' said Mike Davidson, a registered Kroger
pharmacist in Centerville. ``My 5-year-old daughter Shelby is kind
of picky, and we've had to change the flavor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If a child doesn't care for the first taste chosen, parents can
have the medicine reflavored two or three times free of charge.
</P>
<P>
   Flavorx does not alter the effectiveness of the drug taken. An
over-the-counter bottle of cough medicine works just as well after
the few flavorful drops are figured in. And there is no age
restriction _ adults can be choosy, too.
</P>
<P>
   If the children are fine, but you need help getting the cat to
swallow his hairball medicine, Flavorx Veterinary System is working
on a version for pets. Flavors such as beef, tuna and liver have
been launched to help owners avoid kitty scratches and barks of
disgust.
</P>
<P>
   And, Kramm notes on the Web site: ``Dogs like peanut butter and
birds like grape.''

RUSTIC RETREAT ON GITCHE GUMEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: See also TRAVEL-GREAT-LAKES, TRAVEL-LAKE-ERIE)  
 (For release Sunday, August 13)  
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last September, on a family trip to Longfellow's ``shining
Big-Sea-Water'' _ Lake Superior in Minnesota _ we hiked, bicycled,
canoed, sailed, visited historic sites and gobbled lake trout and
heavenly homemade doughnuts. We even swam in the icy water.
</P>
<P>
   What made a fine adventure extraordinary was our stay at
Naniboujou Lodge. Founded as a private club for the likes of Babe
Ruth, Jack Dempsey and Ring Lardner, the rustic 71-year-old
building of shingles and glass is listed on the National Register
of Historic Places. It is on scenic Highway 61, memorialized in the
Dylan song.
</P>
<P>
   We were intrigued, but were sure Naniboujou was out of our price
range. The first of many pleasant surprises was that rooms are $70
to $90 a night. We ended up doing even better with a special deal
for families. For $110, we got two cozy, interconnected rooms, each
with a small, shower-equipped bathroom (more expensive rooms have
larger baths with tubs) and knotty pine furnishings. We would have
been happier with a view of the lake, but for a family accustomed
to rough-and-tumble housekeeping cottages, we reveled in the fact
that our beds were made and rooms thoroughly cleaned each morning.
</P>
<P>
   We arrived on a Sunday evening and after we had finished our
first fine meal of lake trout in the vast dining room, our waitress
told us the almost full moon would rise around 10.
</P>
<P>
   By the time our sons, Roy, 11, and Guy, 9, were asleep, the moon
had changed from a dangling pumpkin to an impossibly large sheer
white orb. My wife, Suzanne, and I stood on the shore for a moment,
entranced by the broad band of light that paved the rippling
``Kitchi-Gami'' _ the original Indian term for the greatest lake
(Longfellow called it ``Gitche Gumee.''). I remembered that Guy had
pronounced at dinner: ``The fun's just starting.''
</P>
<P>
   The fun here started a long time ago, though not in the manner
intended.
</P>
<P>
   Naniboujou was born in the twilight of the Jazz Age, when nobody
imagined that the stock market would soon crash, killing the
immense and crazy dreams of a crazy decade. For the rich group who
banded together in the late 1920s to form an exclusive club of
1,000 men of affluence and achievement on the rocky shores of Lake
Superior, the party was just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   A scrapbook of articles and newspaper clippings in the lobby
told us of the big plans to turn a virgin forest into a golf
course, a dozen tennis courts, a marina for yachts and a clubhouse
built from native stone. Celebrities lent their names in return for
free membership. Lardner even promised to recommend the club to
friends ``as soon as I find out how to pronounce it.''
</P>
<P>
   The name itself reflected grandiose, if quixotic aspiration. The
lakeside retreat was called Naniboujou after the Cree Indian god of
the outdoors who ruled the Lake Superior area. Naniboujou fueled
great myths: it was he who invented the raspberry and made the
blueberry grow in marshy places, not to mention chasing the devil
from the North Shore.
</P>
<P>
   So when Naniboujou opened on July 7, 1929, with fireworks,
flappers and its very own fable, promoters were already moving on
to the next thing _ adding 5,000 acres and a hunting lodge near the
Canadian border to the resort's original 3,330. But just four
months later came Black Friday, members stopped paying dues, and by
the next summer nobody was coming. Only the clubhouse _ today's
hotel _ was built. By all rights, Naniboujou should have died then
and there.
</P>
<P>
   The club idea did. By 1932, the lodge was open to any paying
guest. Then came a succession of uses and owners; it was closed
during World War II. Then a family named Wallace owned it for
nearly two decades, transforming it into a hotel for families. In
1985, a young couple bought it, determined to carry on the new
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Tim and Nancy Ramey, like the Wallaces, were part of an
evangelical Christian organization. They strained mightily to come
up with the purchase price, relying on prayer and friends' money.
In one sense, they bought far less than the original resort: the
more than 3,000 acres across the street had long ago become a
magnificent state park with a spectacular waterfall.
</P>
<P>
   Today, just nine acres belong to the resort. But it seems much
bigger. There is a quarter mile of beach frontage and a wide lawn
with chairs for relaxing. Birch, pine and maple trees rustle in the
lake breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the heart of the resort _ the Great Hall, which is used
as the dining room _ is covered in colorful zigzagging designs in a
psychedelic marriage of Art Deco and traditional Cree Indian
patterns, the original paint from 1929. At one end stands a
20-foot-high fireplace made with 200 tons of rounded Lake Superior
rocks. The ceiling is arched to represent the bottom of a canoe.
</P>
<P>
   The Rameys updated the building little by little, adding
wood-burning fireplaces in 5 of the 24 rooms, a solarium and a new
heating system. They also set policies intended to take guests back
to a gentler time: there are no televisions. There is only one VCR,
in the solarium, and it is for guests to watch family-type movies
or a home video of a really bad storm in 1996. Alcohol, which must
be supplied by the guests themselves, is permitted only in guests'
rooms. (Ice will be delivered upon request.) Nancy says the couple
makes no attempt to evangelize, focusing instead on creating an
environment where people ``can slow down and enjoy each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually, all seven Ramey children, ranging in age from 5 to 25,
help out in the lodge where four of them were born. Nancy, who
bakes all the bread herself, said, ``Coming here should be like
coming home.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in the minds of the original promoters, that was pretty
much the idea. ``What to do at Naniboujou?'' they asked in their
ornate brochure. ``Live, that's the principal matter.''
</P>
<P>
   So, for a week, we did. We loved the breakfasts of homemade
granola, blueberry flapjacks and elaborate egg dishes, as well as
the almond-crusted walleye and steak basted with balsamic vinegar
at dinner. Afternoon teatime included treats like cucumber
sandwiches and white chocolate scones. The Sunday buffet brunch at
$10.95 is so sumptuous that when we were there it attracted a crowd
of more than 400 or more in a county of just 4,000. Many stood in
line outside waiting to get in.
</P>
<P>
   It is the just-hanging-out stuff that is nicest for a family.
Roy loved playing basketball and pitching horseshoes. Guy liked
swimming in the chilly water with me. (``Another memory
completed,'' he announced after his first dip.) Suzanne liked to
watch the myriad changes in the northern sky from the old-fashioned
chair glider swing on the front lawn. We all enjoyed sitting in the
solarium where there was an upright piano and sheet music of Cole
Porter and Gershwin, Monopoly and other board games and binoculars
to observe shore birds.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the audacious dream of the founders to build a sporting
paradise, the equipment available is almost charmingly modest:
horseshoes and croquet; strolling along the lake is by far the most
popular activity. Kayaks can be rented in nearby Grand Marais and
canoes at the many little resorts on the lakes just inland.
</P>
<P>
   In the pleasant solarium library, I kept returning to the
Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms. Mushrooms
are common in the vicinity, along with wild blueberries,
strawberries and raspberries.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece, always, was Lake Superior, the world's largest
freshwater lake in surface area. As you look toward the horizon,
the water shimmers in bands of four or more colors, ranging from
pale gold to the deepest blue. On one shore walk just a little
south of Naniboujou, the beach changed from fine gravel to round
stones to intricate basalt outcroppings.
</P>
<P>
   Hiking was our favorite activity. There are many nearby trails,
some steep, often winding through the birches and, almost always,
within earshot of a stream.
</P>
<P>
   Most of our hikes, including the shore walk, were on the
Superior Hiking Trail. Extending from Two Harbors, Minn., to
Canada, the 200-mile trail was begun in the mid-1980s along the
model of the Appalachian Trail. On one three-mile hike on the
Kadunce River trail, several miles from Naniboujou, we took time to
read some comments from hikers in a notebook kept in an unlocked
box near a waterfall. My favorite: ``I'm 73 and this country is
very beautiful _ but not as beautiful as my wife Dana.'' _ Bob
</P>
<P>
   Another trip was to Grand Portage National Monument about 30
miles north, near the Canadian border. There we learned of the
voyageurs, those intrepid canoeists who fanned out across the
northern reaches of North America to create a new economy, and
ultimately a new consciousness. Our well-informed guides wore
18th-century costumes and demonstrated boat-building, pie-making
and other skills.
</P>
<P>
   Later we hiked up Mount Rose and were rewarded with a lovely
view of the fort and the lake _ home, at that moment, to a single
sailboat. Next trip, Roy and I plan to hike the Grand Portage _
meaning Great Carrying Place _ along which the voyageurs brought
trade goods from one direction and furs from the other. It is more
than likely that we will skip the 90-pound load each voyageur
carried on the 17-mile round trip.
</P>
<P>
   We made many trips to Grand Marais, a picturesque harbor village
15 miles to the south. The town's slightly quirky sensibility is
suggested by the folk art that pops up everywhere: for instance, a
fishing tackle store has an enormous lake trout popping through the
side of the building.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   We loved hanging around the World's Best Donuts, where we
feasted on jelly-stuffed doughnuts called bismarks. We saw boats
and baskets being built at the North House Folk School and took a
sail on the school's schooner Hjordis, a wonderful two-hour trip
for $35 a person. I rented a mountain bike at the local bike store,
and was given directions for a more than challenging scenic ride on
logging roads and snowmobile trails to the west of town.
</P>
<P>
   The people in Grand Marais are remarkably friendly. When our
rental car refused to start after dinner one evening, drivers kept
offering us a jump. Sue from the local service station drove more
than 30 miles out of her way to give us a ride back to Naniboujou.
</P>
<P>
   We figured people in the north country naturally help each other
out. Tim Ramey, for instance, had served as a volunteer fireman. In
the fall of 1998, a fireplace in a burning house collapsed on him,
leaving him paralyzed. He nevertheless mans the phone on Sunday
afternoons and is full of plans to upgrade Naniboujou further,
beginning with modernizing the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   It all recalls Naniboujou's mission, as defined in the original
brochure of a long-ago club. The idea was to get ``back to the
beginning of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting back is our intention. Roy put our names on the list for
next year's drawing at the World's Best Donuts, and we will return
to see if 2668 turns into our lucky number.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A system of thunderstorms over parts of the southern Great Lakes
on Tuesday morning will move east-southeast across Ohio into
western Pennsylvania and western New York during the day. If the
system maintains its intensity, there will be a risk of severe
weather in this region, with damaging straight-line winds posing
the biggest threat in a few spots.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, potent thunderstorms are possible later Tuesday
across parts of southern Wisconsin and southern Michigan as another
upper-air disturbance arrives in the fast current of steering winds
high over the northern-tier states.
</P>
<P>
   A tandem of easterly waves, which are disturbances moving from
east to west over low latitudes, will increase the chance of
showers and thunderstorms along the western Gulf Coast and
east-central Florida.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: SUNDAY FLOODS
</P>
<P>
   Recurrent thunderstorms deluged the Laurel Highlands of
southwestern Pennsylvania with as much as 5 inches of rain on
Sunday, causing flash flooding. Heavy rains in mountainous and
hilly terrain are infamous for producing flash floods. For
starters, the sloping terrain can augment the lifting of humid
surface air, thereby energizing thunderstorms. Rain falling at high
rates from terrain-enhanced thunderstorms then runs off rapidly and
gets quickly channeled into the valleys below. The sudden rush
overwhelms streams and river tributaries with a flooding surge of
water. &QL;

Lieberman's camp ISRAEL-LIEBERMAN _ JERUSALEM _ If Vice President

OPERA AND LITURGY IN MEDIEVAL LUCCA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, August 13)  
 By BERNARD HOLLAND     
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUCCA, Italy _ Lucca in September can make one forget the
Renaissance ever happened. Situated just above the knee of the
Italian boot barely 20 miles from the Mediterranean Sea, this
Tuscan city of 87,500, long prosperous and well pleased with
itself, uses the beginning of autumn to celebrate what it was and
what in good part it still is.
</P>
<P>
   The dour beauty of the old city is medieval. Florence is 50
miles to the southeast but even more distant in spirit. The Romans
gave the town its enduring roots although Lucca (probably from
``luk,'' the Ligurian word for marshland) had residents going back
to Paleolithic times. The marks of an economic boom during the
first two centuries of the Christian era have not gone away. The
great amphitheater in the center of old Lucca is Roman to this day,
as are some of the surviving walls around the city.
</P>
<P>
   Lucca became both a crossroads for trade and more important a
purveyor of silk, which it sold to both Europe and Asia. The feudal
struggles that followed were not good for business, ending in some
ugly 15th-century episodes during which Florence and the hated
nearby Pisa moved in and established rule. There was also an
unfortunate takeover by Napoleon and his sister Elisa in the early
1800s, but Lucca _ handsome and livable _ eventually retook and
retained its air of independence and hard work. The mulberry trees
that ring the ramparts remind the visitor of the city's silk trade.
The banks that seem to occupy every corner of the old city today
testify that the Lucchesi have found new ways to make money.
</P>
<P>
   If the ancient buildings and the narrow streets of old Lucca act
as physical reminders, it is the enduring attitude toward art and
religion that makes this city feel so medieval. The Renaissance
told us that painting, architecture and music could exist away from
the church, where it had been so at home. In the third week of
September, Lucca has the festival of the Volto Santo to remind us
of old unities, beginning with a midmonth procession of solemnity
and beauty to make its point.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wandering Saint'' (loosely translated) is a life-sized
crucifix that was carved, according to legend, by Nicodemus from a
cedar of Lebanon. It is said to have arrived in Lucca on a cart
drawn by untamed oxen after having come ashore on an unmanned ship
at some shadowy time a millennium ago. Legend says that boatmen
from Pisa were the first to spot the floating crucifix, but broke
their oars trying to approach it. The Lucchesi had no such problem,
hence their current ownership. The Pisani, I am sure, have another
story.
</P>
<P>
   Ownership seemed to have had its problems early on. Apparent
inanimacy did not keep this dark and fierce-eyed image of Christ
from walking periodically from its perch at night and reclining in
adjacent fields. There, the ancient Lucchesi would find it in the
morning and restore it to its church. Now elegantly housed at the
Cathedral of San Martino within a small 15th-century octagonal
temple designed by Matteo Civitali and set in an enclave to the
left of the main altar, the Volto Santo has stopped its wandering
ways.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with a little help, it makes a yearly sacred promenade, the
Luminaria di Santa Croce. Outfitted with a crown, the simple robe
on the Christ figure covered with elaborate ornament, this object
of continued and sincere devotion waits every Sept. 13 for sundown.
Streetlights are turned off and torches lighted, and the ancient
crucifix is carried for about two hours across the half-mile width
of Old Town from the Church of San Frediano to the cathedral. Good
deeds and good fortune are attributed to the Volto Santo, and in
gratitude gold plaques from citizens are hung for display in the
cathedral, or cash is donated.
</P>
<P>
   For this slow march, clergy from local and nearby churches is
joined by squadrons of parishioners, all in full regalia. Windows
along the Via Fillungo are embellished with richly decorated cloth
and carpet. The procession, slowed by the narrowness of the
streets, passes the Piazza San Giovanni and then reaches the
cathedral. Participants keep up their strength with nut candies
called croccanti, which are made and sold for the occasion from the
bancarelle, or street carts, set up along the way.
</P>
<P>
   At San Martino, high Mass is celebrated and a motet, written
annually for the occasion, is sung. For the last decade the
composer has been one of the city's musical activists, Msgr. Emilio
Maggini. His predecessors include the father, grandfather and
great-grandfather of the opera composer Giacomo Puccini, all of
them church musicians. If the cathedral is filled to capacity,
which it usually is, loudspeakers on the piazza outside convey the
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Two to three hours can pass from start to finish, by which time
Lucchesi are ready for dinner. For the immediate celebrants the
church lays on a banquet; restaurants are filled, or else families
go home to dinner.
</P>
<P>
   This has been an evening when art serves the church, but in
multiple events lasting through October, the church opens its doors
to art and music. The La Scala Orchestra's concert last fall of
non-operatic Puccini conducted by Riccardo Muti was held, for
example, in San Frediano. Art exhibits are everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   It is at this time of year that theater and opera also come to
life. The jewel-like and historic Teatro del Giglio begins its
opera season; last fall it was with ``La Sonnambula'' by Bellini.
Puccini, like Catalani and Boccherini, were from this town, and the
citizenry, amazingly just now awaking to the extraordinary
reputation of ``La Boheme'' and ``Madama Butterfly'' in the rest of
the world, are plotting citywide festivals of Pucciniana in the
next few years: in October, ``Il Trittico,'' followed in succesive
seasons by ``La Fanciulla del West'' and ``Turandot.''
</P>
<P>
   If culture begins to wear on you, comforts are to be had. One
place to stay is the large, slightly worn but engaging Hotel
Universo. Administered by silver-haired, good-hearted but sometimes
grumpy men, the Universo is reasonably priced and looks directly
across the Piazza del Giglio to the opera house. Once a ducal
palazzo, its rooms tend now to be small and minimal in the manner
of so many European midpriced hotels. Traces of grandeur remain in
the high-ceilinged lobby and in the faded murals and frescoes of
the second-floor breakfast and conference rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at the Universo's front door, one can soak up music
history without so much as wiggling the toes. Look straight ahead
to the Giglio where Gilbert Duprez in 1831 introduced Italian opera
to the first tenorial high C sung from the chest, thus changing the
medium forever. Turn your head to the right and contemplate the
stately Palazzo Ducale, where Paganini, wizard of the violin, had
apartments and was said to frolic illicitly with his landlord,
Maria Luisa of the Parma Bourbons.
</P>
<P>
   If you are hungry and feeling a bit fancy, walk two doors to the
left. At the Ristorante del Giglio one finds superior veal and wild
mushrooms and a splendid La Badiola red wine for under $40 a
person. Fancy is not always best in this city, however.

   I have dined well and often in the back room of Da Guido on the
Via Giovanni Battista. Presiding is Leo Barsotti, who makes or
grows almost everything you eat: wine, olive oil, chickens,
rabbits, produce. Finish with the hard biscotti Toscani and an
after-dinner glass of the local vin santo. One's stomach is well
treated for under $20. (Blue-collar workers pay by the week, and
assuredly less.) Barsotti doesn't speak English, but his young
waiter is taking lessons and is happy to use you for practice.
Another plain and pleasant place is Slim Joes restaurant on the
Corte Campana, started originally by an American couple. Large,
well-lighted and popular with townsfolk, Da Giulio is near the city
walls on the Via delle Conce.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly a tourist destination, Lucca could use more hotels.
Locals will steer you to small and welcoming ones off the winding
central streets. One is the Piccolo Hotel Puccini on the Via di
Poggio, another is La Luna on the Via Fillungo.
</P>
<P>
   Lucca, like most of urban Europe, has its antique district (the
Via del Battistero) and all the familiar big-name boutiques. But
Bellandi on the Via Beccheria behind the Universo, offers sweaters,
scarves and related goods of a splendor and variety I don't find in
New York at three times the price. If you, like me, pine for those
old European bath towels, the ones with the hard and waffled
textures, they are stocked at In Villa on the Via Vittorio Veneto.
I bought two big ones for $35 each, and scarcely anything Turkish
has touched my back since.
</P>
<P>
   The walls, most of which were built in the 16th and 17th
centuries to protect Lucca from marauders, also help modify the
corrosive traffic plaguing most Italian cities. Many thoroughfares
and byways are for pedestrians only, and this is truly a walkable
town, especially along the tops of the walls themselves. One stop
on almost every pedestrian tour is the Caffe di Simo on the Via
Fillungo where Puccini and colleagues gathered. It has its glossy
charm, but odd and accidental discoveries on aimless walks are
often more interesting. I was struck by the postered death notices
found on walls all over town. Paid obituaries in local newspapers,
I was told, are expensive; these ``manifesti per lutto'' are the
medium of choice.
</P>
<P>
   The towers are fascinating. Where 130 once existed, only about
nine remain, some four and five stories high. Trump-like, rich
homeowners once used towers to compete among themselves: the higher
the altitude, the more potent the family. That the Torre delle Ore
on the Via Fillungo survives has to do with its clock, deemed a
practical necessity.
</P>
<P>
   Wandering through the Roman Ampitheater, laid out in the first
century A.D., one comes upon ancient houses now being peeled to the
original brick. The smooth facades we associate with old Italian
cities were in fact a product of the plague. Stucco, it was thought
by 14th-century Lucchesi, sealed off disease.
</P>
<P>
   The Renaissance did pay rich visits to Lucca. See especially
Tintoretto's ``Last Supper'' at San Martino, the cathedral built in
the sixth century, rebuilt in the 11th and notable for its stacked
arcades and sculpted pillars. A lot of Lucca's striking pictures,
facades and sculpture are older. In San Martino, spend time in two
places. First, before the Volto Santo. If the glaring eyes of the
Christ figure follow you too closely, find relief and calm in the
extraordinarily beautiful Sarcophagus of Ilaria del Carretto, young
wife of the powerful Paolo Guinigi, carved by Jacopo della Quercia
in 1405.
</P>
<P>
   Mystery and something vaguely disquieting inhabit the first
image, utter serenity the second. A few moments with both might
help prepare the visitor for the people out there on the streets of
Lucca. They have been good businessmen for several millenniums, yet
it is these same shrewd and practical people who hold firmly to the
city's mysterious Christian legends. The thoughts may be new, but
they are informed and colored by old beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   If the Lucchesi dream of the past, they also insist on time to
live right now. The growing, cooking and consuming of food is
discussed in bars and cafes as rabidly as baseball is in the Bronx.
This city must have its workaholics, but the flow of pedestrians in
the streets at noon and late-afternoon reflects a citizenry that
knows when to put business behind it and to enjoy friends and
family. Creating space for both enterprise and relaxation is a
life's work here.
</P>
<P>
   MORE ABOUT LUCCA
</P>
<P>
   Getting There  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One thing that protects Lucca from a tourist onslaught is its
lack of an airport. Alitalia and British Airways schedule regular
flights into Pisa, 15 miles away. Train service to Lucca is regular
and cheap, with departures every two hours or so.
</P>
<P>
   Taxis are metered and not unreasonable. I took a cab from Pisa
with a Lucchese and paid $40, at 2,100 lire to the dollar, but
returned alone for $48. Just smile. Minimal fleecing _ the furtive
surcharge or unspoken tourist tax _ should be accepted with good
grace.  &QL; 
Getting Around  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lucca is a walled city of manageable size that continues to lean
more and more toward pedestrians and away from cars. Just about
everything worth seeing can be reached on foot. A quick drive by
rental car will get you to Puccini's charming little retreat at
Torre del Lago about 15 miles west or to such equally charming
hilltop towns as Montecarlo and Barga. And at Barga there is a
first-class summer opera season.  &QL; 
Where to Stay  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Central, appealing and relatively large is the Hotel Universo at
Piazza del Giglio 1, across the Piazza Puccini from the Teatro del
Giglio, Lucca's historic opera house; telephone (39-0583) 493-678,
fax (39-0583) 954-854. Rates are $71 for a single and &QL; 
$124 for a double, breakfast included, but can actually vary wildly
according to who you are.
</P>
<P>
   A smaller alternative is La Luna, Corte Campagnoni 12, telephone
(39-0583) 493634, fax (39-0583) 490021; $52 single and $81 double,
with breakfast buffet $7 per person.
</P>
<P>
   The Piccolo Hotel Puccini, Via di Poggio 9, (39-0583) 55421, fax
(39-0583) 53487, charges $44.50 single and $61 double.Lucca's
recent discovery by tourists has caught the city short of hotels.
But newer ones are appearing almost monthly.  &QL; 
Where to Eat  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For fancy dining with white tablecloth, spiffy service and
splendid food and wine, try the Ristorante del Giglio, Piazza del
Giglio 2, next door to the Hotel Universo, (39-0583) 494058. Forty
to fifty dollars a person will take care of you splendidly.
</P>
<P>
   Da Giulio, Via della Conce 45/47, near the city walls, is a
family favorite for locals; (39-0583) 55948. At Da Guido, Via C.
Battisti 28, you will be hard pressed to spend more than $20 a
person; (39-0583) 467219. Simple, straightforward and frugal is
Slim Joes, at Corte Campano 3; (39-0583) 312037.  &QL; 
Where to Shop  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lucca has all the fancy international shops you will find on
Madison Avenue, but for sweaters and woolen goods of unusual
quality and imagination go to Bellandi Maglierie at Via Beccherie
25, just behind the Hotel Universo; (39-0583) 496052.

HIS FATHER'S SON
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Femi Kuti proved in a potent set Sunday at the Hollywood
Bowl, the Afrobeat apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone owns the rights to the syncopated, polyrhythmic sound,
it's Kuti, the 38-year-old son of the late Nigerian Afrobeat
superstar and political irritant Fela Anikulapo-Kuti.
</P>
<P>
   While somewhat similar, Femi's high-energy music differs from
his father's in several key ways. As demonstrated in concert and on
his well- received debut album, ``Shoki Shoki,'' Kuti's songs
average six or seven minutes; Fela's hypnotic jams often topped 30
minutes on record and stretched to more than an hour in concert.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Femi's tight, well-rehearsed, 15-member Positive Force
band adds accessible pop elements to Afrobeat's James
Brown-inspired groove, and with just one guitarist, three
dancer-singers and a small horn section, the number of people on
stage was less than a third of Fela's usual sprawling backup unit.
</P>
<P>
   The 6,305-strong Bowl crowd took some time to warm up to Kuti's
inviting opening set. As the sun dimmed, though, the initial
scattered dancers were joined by others and by the time Kuti
launched into his most tuneful number, the lascivious ``Beng Beng
Beng,'' almost the entire audience was up on its feet, swaying
joyously.
</P>
<P>
   Kuti, who closely resembles his father, left politics out of the
performance, except once when mentioning that his music seeks to
put a positive spin on a country widely known for AIDS and civil
unrest. By comparison, Fela would often stop the music to rail
against the World Bank or other governmental agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Kuti didn't perform an encore.
</P>
<P>
   Next up was ex-Brown saxophonist Maceo Parker, who offered a set
of mannered funk that only caught fire when he covered tunes
associated with his former boss.
</P>
<P>
   Parker's staccato approach was most effective on simmering
readings of ``Pass the Peas,'' ``Doing It to Death'' and ``Cold
Sweat.''
</P>
<P>
   While the spotlight was plainly on Parker _ who at one point
spread his arms wide and announced ``I'm Maceo Parker!'' in case
there was any question _ his band was underused and two backup
singers mostly danced throughout the set while the audience largely
remained seated.
</P>
<P>
   Parker, who left the Brown band to go solo in 1988, probably
would have been more effective Sunday as an opening act for Kuti,
whose warm persona invited audience participation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Kuti/Parker bill was an imaginative one, and
hopefully it signals more world music to come at the Bowl. &QL;

DELTA HIRES E-COM FIRM TO STREAMLINE AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Enigma Inc., a privately held business-to-business e-commerce
company, said Monday it has a contract with Delta Air Lines to
provide software that will allow the airline to customize some
repair manuals and increase maintenance efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   The contract, worth several hundred thousand dollars, will allow
Delta mechanics to have electronic access on the shop floor to
maintenance manuals for the Pratt &AMP; Whitney PW4000 engines. Eight
percent of the passenger jets in Delta's fleet are powered by the
PW4000.
</P>
<P>
   While several airlines used Enigma products because suppliers
such as engine manufacturers use them, Delta is the first airline
to purchase the software, called Xtend. Xtend allows the airline to
add its own maintenance procedures to those of the manufacturer,
and bring the system behind its own firewall.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most important features of Xtend is that the
enhanced navigation capabilities provided by Pratt &AMP; Whitney in
their e-catalogs will apply to our customized data as well,'' Mike
Lane, manager of the airline operations portfolio at Delta, said in
a statement. ``Xtend is the only e-publishing product that
intelligently supports the enormous amount of complex content
involved in jet engine maintenance and repair.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy Clark, vice president of marketing for Enigma, said
the &UR;  &LR; Burlington, Mass. company hopes Delta will purchase additional
software for other engine types.
</P>
<P>
   The software allows Delta to modify Pratt &AMP; Whitney manuals and
access them electronically on Delta's intranet. It also links to
illustrated parts catalogs and parts lists, and ties in to
inventory management programs, said Clark. The system will also
greatly accelerate acceptance of service bulletins issued by the
manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   ``By automating its maintenance information processes, Delta
further underscores its commitment to reducing aircraft equipment
downtime,'' Nathan Shuchami, vice president of aerospace at Enigma,
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Enigma said Delta expects the system to reduce the length of its
overall maintenance cycle by as much as 10 percent.

PILOT, WEATHER WOES BRING UNITED FLIGHT CANCELLATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   United Airlines canceled 180 flights Monday _ 7.5 percent of its
daily schedule _ as wildcat actions by pilots working without a
contract and bad weather continued to disrupt the world's largest
airline.
</P>
<P>
   In a summer punctuated with cancellations and delays, United has
been particularly hard hit in the last few days. The airline
canceled more than 120 flights Sunday and about 150 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   While hubs in Chicago and San Francisco were particularly hard
hit, Logan International Airport in Boston was not unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, four flights into Boston were canceled, as were four
outbound flights, said Matt Triaka, an airline spokesman. Triaka
did not know if weather or labor issues were responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Juves, spokesman for the Massachusetts Port Authority,
which owns and operates Logan, said the cancellations resulted in
minor disruptions. Most passengers were put on later flights, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Low clouds in San Francisco, residual effects of bad weather in
the Midwest, and a line of storms along the East Coast all
contributed to the delays. But United was particuarly hard hit
because of labor problems with its 10,000 pilots, who have been
working without a contract since April.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are facing some operational challenges today,'' Triaka
said.
</P>
<P>
   Because pilots refused to work overtime, United had already
pared its summer schedule by 3 percent, but pilots are still
balking at working overtime and taking other actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are starting to see is a sharp increase in the number
of pilots calling in sick,'' Triaka said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It creates a very challenging operational environment, and
challenges for the customer service people, who need to
reaccommodate passengers on the next flight out,'' Triaka said.
``If we can't get them out on United flights we are trying to book
them on other airlines.''
</P>
<P>
   If a labor problem causes a cancellation thaty strands
passengers overnight, United will give them hotel vouchers, the
airline said.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots and the airline are meeting daily with the Natioanl
Mediation Board, and both side are hopeful a new contract can be
reached next month. One issue is the proposed takeover of US
Airways by United, and how the airlines would merger their pilot
seniority lists.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Air Line Pilots Association were not
available for comment.

NETMORF, BARNES &AMP; NOBLE IN DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NetMorf Inc., a new Boston company that converts World Wide Web
pages for display on Internet-connected wireless telephones and
other devices, announced its biggest deal to date, with Barnes &AMP;
Noble's online book-selling site.
</P>
<P>
   BN.com, which already offers online purchasing through wireless
Palm pilots and three national wireless carriers, agreed to use
NetMorf's ``SiteMorfer'' service as its standard ``mobile
commerce'' platform for those devices and future wireless Net
services such as computer screens in cars and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Financial terms were not disclosed. The companies said, however,
that in addition to a fixed fee, privately held NetMorf will
collect a small bounty on each sale transacted through a
SiteMorfer-enabled site. The year-old company considers recurring
e-commerce revenues crucial as it aims to grow and potentially go
public.
</P>
<P>
   While NetMorf aims to simplify the transacation as much as
possible, using a wireless phone to buy a book from BN.com or
rivals such as Amazon.com can be a chore, requiring people to press
numbers repeatedly on the phone keypad to spell the name of a book
they want to buy and enter a shipping address.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Albert, director of wireless with BN.com, said he could
not comment on how many sales the company is actually completing
through wireless connections.
</P>
<P>
   However, Albert said, ``We're very pleased that mobile commerce
is real. From the day we launched, we've been getting sales every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to wireless Palm VII devices and Palm V's outfitted
with Omnisky access, BN.com is a featured link on AT&AMP;T Wireless,
Sprint PCS and Verizon Wireless and reachable through other
carriers' phones at mobile.bn.com. Barnes &AMP; Noble says it has 15
million titles in its catalogue, with 800,000 in stock, but its is
widely considered to lag Amazon in sales and user features.
</P>
<P>
   Albert said BN.com considered several different vendors before
concluing NetMorf was ``the ideal partner'' to oversee both current
wireless sales operations and ``as new devices come out determine
how to adapt to these devices.''
</P>
<P>
   In Nasdaq trading Monday, BN.com stock rose $1.4375 to $5.1875.
It traded as high as $23.50 last October.
</P>
<P>
   Other announced customers for NetMorf services include
CEOExpress.com of Boston, a customizable Web information portal;
PurchasingCenter.com of Burlington, Mass., which sells industrial
and maintenance supplies; and, AnyDay.com, a Cambridge, Mass.
online meeting planning service recently bought by Palm.

IPARTY TO BUY SOME BIG PARTY   STORES, INVENTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Looking to add a brick-and-mortar component to its
e-commerce and catalog operations, iParty Corp. has agreed to buy
some of the assets of The Big Party, a chain that sells balloons,
decorations, and other party-themed merchandise at 54 stores.
</P>
<P>
   Because The Big Party is in bankruptcy protection, the deal to
buy the inventory, fixed assets, and leases of 33 stores, including
possibly 18 stores in Massachusetts, requires the approval of a
Bankruptcy Court in Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Two members of iParty's management team, chief executive Sal
Perisano and his wife, senior vice president Dorice Dionne, are
cofounders of The Big Party, which opened its doors in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Halpern Denny &AMP; Co., a Boston investment firm, assumed ownership
of The Big Party two years ago after he and his wife decided ``we
were ready for a change,'' Perisano said.
</P>
<P>
   As retail evolves into the 21st century, many experts believe
the shrewdest merchants will offer their goods in three channels _
in stores, on the Web, and through catalogs _ and let consumers
decide which channel is the most convenient for them.
</P>
<P>
   To the best of Perisano's knowledge, the acquisition of The Big
Party stores will make iParty the first retailer in its category to
be able to pursue such a three-pronged strategy in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the early-adopter advantage,'' he said, noting that
once stores are renamed iParty.com, they should help drive more
traffic to iParty's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The company began selling its wares at www.iparty.com last
October and added a catalog in April, Perisano said.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to The Big Party and Halpern Denny were not returned, so
it is not clear what will happen to its remaining stores.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Party, which claimed $69 million in sales in 1999, filed
for bankruptcy protection earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   At Party &AMP; Paper Retailer magazine, editor Trisha McMahon Drain
said The Big Party's woes may be an isolated incident in a mostly
healthy industry.
</P>
<P>
   According to Drain, industry sales grew nearly 5 percent last
year to $12.06 billion. Of The Big Party, she said, ``I think they
may have tried to expand too fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Perisano remains convinced that the idea behind The Big Party
remains sound if the stores can operate with lower overhead.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Party and iParty share the same core customer, a woman
between 25 and 50 who in many cases is organizing a party for a
child, he said. Halloween is a major event for party retailers, and
Perisano hopes The Big Party stores can be integrated into iParty's
operations by then.
</P>
<P>
   IParty has attracted $28 million in venture capital funding,
Perisano said. Through a reverse merger transaction, the company
began trading on the American Stock Exchange in January, with the
opening trade at $4.125 per share. Shares closed unchanged Monday
at 50 cents. For its most recent quarter, iParty lost $5.5 million
on sales of $146,834.

   In its 100 years as one of the nation's leading research
institutions, Baylor College of Medicine has tackled projects big
and small. Its researchers helped map the human genome. It is
working on conquering the flu virus. Its researchers delve into
allergies. They also work on cancer, AIDS and infectious diseases,
as well as a range of other research projects affecting neonatal to
geriatric medicine.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. News and World Report this spring ranked Baylor among the
top 10 percent of U.S. medical schools. Baylor tied with the
University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, for 12th place among 125
accredited medical schools. The ranking is based on several
factors, including research activity and number of faculty.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor has a $239 million research budget this year, one of the
largest medical research budgets among U.S. universities. About
1,570 faculty members are involved in research.
</P>
<P>
   Among the medical research projects under way at Baylor, a few
stand out:
</P>
<P>
   Baylor _ where genetic research has been taking place since 1970
_ was selected as one of the U.S. research centers to sequence the
human genome, the strands of genes that now can be studied to find
genetic causes for disease. The project, funded by federal grants
of more than $92 million, involved eight researchers working for 10
years, along with researchers at several other institutions. The
first draft of the human genome was completed this year, and Baylor
is continuing research on the causes of diseases, using information
from that draft.
</P>
<P>
   Under grants of more than $5 million, Baylor researchers are
developing cancers in mice that mimic human breast and prostate
cancers, which will allow researchers to see how cells change from
healthy to malignant. Eventually, researchers hope they will find
the gene that turns those cancers on and off. Previous studies have
created cancer in mice for study, but they have not replicated the
pattern of human cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The National Institutes of Health in April awarded $15.5 million
to Baylor for studies on all aspects of tuberculosis. During the
next seven years, TB specimens and blood samples will be collected
from 500 TB patients in the Houston area, where the rate of the
infectious disease is two to three times the national average.
</P>
<P>
   A study is under way to learn more about how humans can stay
healthy during long space flights. Studies include those on sleep
deprivation, exposure to constant darkness or constant light, bone
loss, radiation effects, nutrition and other physical and
psychological factors that must be understood before man can become
an interplanetary traveler.
</P>
<P>
   The Baylor Flu Center is testing to see how 15,000 children in
Temple, Texas, respond to a nasal spray that it is hoped will work
better than a vaccine in controlling the spread of flu.

<TEXT>
<P>
   For more than a century, Western philosophers and psychologists
have based their discussions of mental life on a cardinal
assumption: that the same basic processes underlie all human
thought, whether in the mountains of Tibet or the grasslands of the
Serengeti.
</P>
<P>
   Cultural differences might dictate what people thought about.
Teen-age boys in Botswana, for example, might discuss cows with the
same passion that New York teen-agers reserved for sports cars.
</P>
<P>
   But the habits of thought _ the strategies people adopted in
processing information and making sense of the world around them _
were, Western scholars assumed, the same for everyone, exemplified
by, among other things, a devotion to logical reasoning, a penchant
for categorization and an urge to understand situations and events
in linear terms of cause and effect.
</P>
<P>
   Recent work by a social psychologist at the University of
Michigan, however, is turning this long-held view of mental
functioning upside down.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of studies comparing European Americans to East
Asians, Dr. Richard Nisbett and his colleagues have found that
people who grow up in different cultures do not just think about
different things: They think differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to think that everybody uses categories in the same
way, that logic plays the same kind of role for everyone in the
understanding of everyday life, that memory, perception, rule
application and so on are the same,'' Nisbett said. ``But we're now
arguing that cognitive processes themselves are just far more
malleable than mainstream psychology assumed.''
</P>
<P>
   A summary of the research will be published next winter in the
journal Psychological Review, and Nisbett discussed the findings
Sunday at the annual meetings of the American Psychological
Association in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In many respects, the cultural disparities the researchers
describe mirror those described by anthropologists, and may seem
less than surprising to Americans who have lived in Asia. And
Nisbett and his colleagues are not the first psychological
researchers to propose that thought may be embedded in cultural
assumptions: Soviet psychologists of the 1930s posed logic problems
to Uzbek peasants, arguing that intellectual tools were influenced
by pragmatic circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   But the new work is stirring interest in academic circles
because it tries to define and elaborate on cultural differences
through a series of tightly controlled laboratory experiments. And
the theory underlying the research challenges much of what has been
considered gospel in cognitive psychology for the last 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's true, it turns on its head a great deal of the science
that many of us have been doing, and so it's sort of scary and
thrilling at the same time,'' said Dr. Susan Andersen, a professor
of psychology at New York University and an associate editor at
Psychological Review.
</P>
<P>
   In the broadest sense, the studies _ carried out in the United
States, Japan, China and Korea _ document a familiar division.
Easterners, the researchers find, appear to think more
``holistically,'' paying greater attention to context and
relationship, relying more on experience-based knowledge than
abstract logic and showing more tolerance for contradiction.
Westerners are more ``analytic'' in their thinking, tending to
detach objects from their context, to avoid contradictions and to
rely more heavily on formal logic.
</P>
<P>
   In one study, for example, by Nisbett and Takahiko Masuda, a
graduate student at Michigan, students from Japan and the United
States were shown an animated underwater scene, in which one larger
``focal'' fish swam among smaller fishes and other aquatic life.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to describe what they saw, the Japanese subjects were much
more likely to begin by setting the scene, saying for example,
``There was a lake or pond'' or ``The bottom was rocky,'' or ``The
water was green.'' Americans, in contrast, tended to begin their
descriptions with the largest fish, making statements like ``There
was what looked like a trout swimming to the right.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Japanese subjects in the study made 70 percent more
statements about aspects of the background environment than
Americans, and twice as many statements about the relationships
between animate and inanimate objects. A Japanese subject might
note, for example, that ``The big fish swam past the gray
seaweed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans were much more likely to zero in on the biggest
fish, the brightest object, the fish moving the fastest,'' Nisbett
said. ``That's where the money is as far as they're concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   But the greater attention paid by East Asians to context and
relationship was more than just superficial, the researchers found.
Shown the same larger fish swimming against a different, novel
background, Japanese participants had more difficulty recognizing
it than Americans, indicating that their perception was intimately
bound with their perception of the background scene.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to interpreting events in the social world, the
Asians seemed similarly sensitive to context, and quicker than the
Americans to detect when people's behavior was determined by
situational pressures.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists have long documented what they call the
fundamental attribution error, the tendency for people to explain
human behavior in terms of the traits of individual actors, even
when powerful situational forces are at work. Told that a man has
been instructed to give a speech endorsing a particular
presidential candidate, for example, most people will still believe
that the speaker believes what he is saying.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Asians, according to Nisbett and his colleagues, may in some
situations be less susceptible to such errors, indicating that they
do not describe a universal way of thinking, but merely the way
that Americans think.
</P>
<P>
   In one study, by Nisbett and Incheol Choi, of Seoul National
University in Korea, the Korean and American subjects were asked to
read an essay either in favor of or opposed to the French
conducting atomic tests in the Pacific. The subjects were told that
the essay writer had been given ``no choice'' about what to write.
But subjects from both cultures still showed a tendency to ``err,''
judging that the essay writers believed in the position endorsed in
the essays.
</P>
<P>
   When the Korean subjects were first required to undergo a
similar experience themselves, writing an essay according to
instructions, they quickly adjusted their estimates of how strongly
the original essay writers believed what they wrote. But Americans
clung to the notion that the essay writers were expressing sincere
beliefs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   One of the most striking dissimilarities found by the
researchers emerged in the way East Asians and Americans in the
studies responded to contradiction. Presented with weaker arguments
running contrary to their own, Americans were likely to solidify
their opinions, Nisbett said, ``clobbering the weaker arguments,''
and resolving the threatened contradiction in their own minds.
Asians, however, were more likely to modify their own position,
acknowledging that even the weaker arguments had some merit.
</P>
<P>
   In one study, for example, Asian and American subjects were
presented with strong arguments in favor of financing a research
project on adoption. A second group was presented both with strong
arguments in support of the project and weaker arguments opposing
it.
</P>
<P>
   Both Asian and American subjects in the first group expressed
strong support for the research. But while Asian subjects in the
second group responded to the weaker opposing arguments by
decreasing their support, American subjects actually increased
their endorsement of the project in response to the opposing
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of studies, Nisbett and Kaiping Peng of the
University of California at Berkeley found that Chinese subjects
were less eager to resolve contradictions in a variety of
situations than American subjects. Asked to analyze a conflict
between mothers and daughters, American subjects quickly came down
in favor of one side or the other. Chinese subjects were more
likely to see merit on both sides, commenting, for example, that,
``Both the mothers and the daughters have failed to understand each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Given a choice between two different types of philosophical
argument, one based on analytical logic, devoted to resolving
contradiction, the other on a dialectical approach, accepting of
contradiction, Chinese subjects preferred the dialectical approach,
while Americans favored the logical arguments. And Chinese subjects
expressed more liking than Americans for proverbs containing a
contradiction, like the Chinese saying ``Too modest is half
boastful.'' American subjects, Nisbett said, found such
contradictions ``rather irritating.''
</P>
<P>
   Nisbett and Dr. Ara Norenzayan of the University of Illinois
have also found indications that when logic and experiential
knowledge are in conflict, Americans are more likely than Asians to
adhere to the rules of formal logic, in keeping with a tradition
that in Western societies began with the ancient Greeks.
</P>
<P>
   For example, presented with a logical sequence like, ``All
animals with fur hibernate. Rabbits have fur. Therefore rabbits
hibernate,'' the Americans, the researchers found, were more likely
to accept the validity of the argument, separating its formal
structure, that of a syllogism, from its content, which might or
might not be plausible. Asians, in contrast, more frequently judged
such syllogisms as invalid based on their implausibility _ not all
animals with fur do in fact hibernate.
</P>
<P>
   While the cultural disparities traced in the researchers' work
are substantial, their origins are much less clear. Historical
evidence suggests that a divide between Eastern and Occidental
thinking has existed at least since ancient times, a tradition of
adversarial debate, formal logical argument and analytic deduction
flowering in Greece, while in China an appreciation for context and
complexity, dialectical argument and a tolerance for the ``yin and
yang'' of life flourished.
</P>
<P>
   How much of this East-West difference is a result of differing
social and religious practices, different languages or even
different geography is anyone's guess. But both styles, Nisbett
said, have advantages, and both have limitations. And neither
approach is written into the genes: Asian-Americans, born in the
United States, are indistinguishable in their modes of thought from
European Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alan Fiske, an associate professor of anthropology at the
University of California at Los Angeles, said that experimental
research like Nisbett's ``complements a lot of ethnographic work
that has been done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anthropologists have been describing these cultures and this
can tell you a lot about everyday life and the ways people talk and
interact,'' Fiske said. ``But it's always difficult to know how to
make sense of these qualitative judgments, and they aren't
controlled in the same way that an experiment is controlled.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet not everyone agrees that all the dissimilarities described
by Nesbitt and his colleagues reflect fundamental differences in
psychological process.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Patricia Cheng, for example, a professor of psychology at
the University of California at Los Angeles, said that many of the
researchers' findings meshed with her own experience. ``Having
grown up in a traditional Chinese family and also being in Western
culture myself,'' she said, ``I do see some entrenched habits of
interpretation of the world that are different across the cultures,
and they do lead to pervasive differences.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cheng says she thinks that some differences _ the Asian
tolerance for contradiction, for example _ are purely social.
``There is not a difference in logical tolerance,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, to the extent that the studies reflect real differences
in thinking and perception, psychologists may have to radically
revise their ideas about what is universal and what is not, and to
develop new models of mental process that take cultural influences
into account.

IN MOSCOW, FIGHTING TO CONTROL THE VODKA

 By PATRICK E. TYLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ No shots have been fired yet, but there is a war going
on under the leafy summer canopy that shades the streets in the
Lefortovo district of the Russian capital. Here, on 20 acres of
factory grounds, thousands of workers are daily engaged in the
production of one of Russia's most essential commodities _ vodka.
</P>
<P>
   Precisely because vodka is such needed balm for the Russian
soul, the country has been riveted _ in the political lull of
August _ by the struggle for control of the Krystall factory, one
of the country's oldest vodka producing plants that last year
rolled out 130 million bottles of famous brands like Stolichnaya
and Krystall itself.
</P>
<P>
   Given the factory's well-known trade marks and estimated value
of $600 million, it was perhaps only a matter of time before this
economic plum became one that rival forces sought to pluck. The
only thing both sides agree on is that the federal government's
attempt to reconsolidate control over the lucrative vodka industry
_ an effort intensified since President Vladimir V. Putin was sworn
in in May _ set off the latest of Russia's business battles.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, armed paramilitary police stormed the factory's
administration building, ordering everyone out, ostensibly so tax
authorities could seize some documents. Once the building was
secured, the troopers made way for Alexander Romanov to enter and
occupy the general manager's suite, along with dozens of muscular
private security guards hired for the occasion. Then the SWAT team
departed.
</P>
<P>
   Romanov, 37, has never worked at Krystall and knows little of
the vodka business _ aside, presumably, from consumption. For
several years, he has been a vice president for public relations
and other duties at Rosneft, Russia's state-owned oil company. He
describes himself as a highly trained ``top manager'' and
grudgingly acknowledges that he went to school with the deputy
minister in the state property administration, who happens to be
leading one of the warring factions on Krystall's board.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 feet away from Romanov's second-floor encampment, the
chief accountant and acting general manager of the Krystall
factory, Vladimir Svirsky, also 37, leads the other board faction,
which controls 40 percent of the stock. This group has set up
defensive positions at the entrance to the production lines where
frightened workers tried to complete their shift Friday, hoping to
avoid violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shouldn't be happening in a factory as important as
this,'' said Svetlana Soborova, who has worked at Krystall for 18
years and now sells the final product in the company's retail
store.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, on a weekend when a state of emergency had been declared in
Moscow to guard against possible terrorist acts on the anniversary
of the uprising by rebel forces in Chechnya, neither the courts,
nor police, nor federal government seemed willing to act.
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood around the 100-year-old factory became a sea of
muscle, with private security guards hired by each warring camp
facing off in front of the huge enterprise, in which the state has
a 51 percent controlling interest. Each side sent patrols out to
roam the streets and alleys around the factory looking for ways to
outmaneuver each other and get control of the premises.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Russia unfortunately we have the phenomenon of a weak
state, where the legal institutions, too, are very weak,'' said
Grigory Koshkarov, a factory financial adviser.
</P>
<P>
   For two years, Russia's leaders have been rediscovering a truism
of the Soviet era _ that vodka, and the tax revenues derived from
its sale, can be the salvation of a beleaguered national budget.
</P>
<P>
   But that will hold true now only if the government can
re-establish control over the vodka industry, where half or more of
the market has been seized by an enormous industry of illegal and
counterfeit distillers.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the government collected $470 million in taxes on
alcohol production, and some estimates indicate this number could
double under tighter state control.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after being sworn in in May, Putin signed a decree creating
a new state-owned conglomerate, Rosspiritprom, to consolidate state
control over 50 distilleries in which the Russian government owns a
majority stake and 20 others in which it is a minority shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   The showdown over Krystall follows months of maneuvering in the
boardroom and the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Romanov went to court last spring seeking to enforce the board's
decision to appoint him acting general manager of the plant, but
the court ruled the appointment was illegal because opposing
directors did not receive 10 days' notice.
</P>
<P>
   Romanov claimed that his rival Svirsky bribed the judge, but
then acknowledged he had no evidence. The board met again in June
and reaffirmed Romanov's appointment, but Svirsky and his directors
walked out.
</P>
<P>
   Svirsky asserts that one or another of Russia's business
oligarchs close to the Kremlin is behind Romanov's appointment and
is seeking to get control of the 40 percent stake now controlled by
employees, managers and their allies. But Svirsky too said he had
no proof.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of waiting for the courts to act on its subsequent
petitions, Romanov's faction orchestrated Friday's takeover.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am authorized by the government to take over the management
of this factory,'' Romanov said. ``Fifty-one percent of the shares
are in the hands of the state, but there is such chaos here.,''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Romanov presented himself as the vanguard of
state power come to reclaim the alcohol industry from incompetents,
thieves and ``swindlers.'' He accused Svirsky of disobeying board
directives, and of trying to become a ``new oligarch'' by amassing
40 percent of the company shares and behaving like ``Napoleon.''
</P>
<P>
   Svirsky countered that his board faction was fighting to keep
control of management, which he said was justified by record
profits and tax payments posted in 1999. ``We are trying to prove
our right to work at this enterprise by the results of our work,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday night, Romanov and Svirsky were showing the strain.
Desktops were littered with the detritus of cold cuts and fast
food. Svirsky needed a shave and Romanov had been sleeping in his
clothes and worrying about Svirsky's guard dogs, one of them known
as a ``man eater,'' that might be loosed on his men if they entered
the plant.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Svirsky addressed employees returning to work,
telling them to ignore any orders from Romanov's men. And the board
chairman, Yevgeny Panteleev, reiterated his support for Romanov's
insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the face of our Russian democracy,'' said a somewhat
grizzled security guard in front of the factory gate. ``Now it is
up to Putin,'' he added, who has pledged to establish a
``dictatorship'' of law in Russia and end the kind of anarchy on
display here.
</P>
<P>
   Notably invisible in the conflict has been Moscow's powerful
mayor, Yuri Luzhkov.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor does not want to intervene in this dispute because
the city's shares are going to the federal government,'' said
Romanov. ``The federal government does not want to intervene until
the shares are turned over.''
</P>
<P>
   Svirsky has effectively blocked both actions by hiding the
corporate seal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am like a kamikaze,'' Svirsky said, ``and I will fight for
my rights to the death.''

   BERLIN _ Two Jewish cemeteries were desecrated in the western
German state of Rhineland-Pfalz and an explosive device found
outside a Jewish family's home in Bavaria, the police said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The incidents contributed to a climate of mounting concern in
Germany over anti-Semitic and anti-immigrant violence by rightist
groups. The attacks are not new, and they reflect the activities of
a small minority, but evidence that extremists are now better armed
and organized has alarmed the government.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder is currently on vacation in
Mallorca. But his spokesman, Uwe-Karsten Heye, met Monday with Paul
Spiegel, the leader of the Central Council of German Jews, to
promote a new initiative called ``Show Your Face.''
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting in Duesseldorf, where a bomb last month
injured nine immigrants, six of them Jews, Heye said an advertising
campaign would begin next month in which famous Germans, including
sports and film celebrities, would exhort the nation to show zero
tolerance for racists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to encourage people to do something against xenophobia
and anti-Semitism,'' Heye said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said Germans had
been too silent in the face of rightist violence. His statement
struck a chord in a nation where the need for ``Zivilcourage'' _
personal courage rooted in a strong moral conscience _ has been
exhorted as an essential quality since the Third Reich demonstrated
the dangers of passivity.
</P>
<P>
   Spiegel said Germans must act together to isolate and undermine
rightist agitators, whose propaganda has thrived particularly in
the formerly communist east. Among many youths, often socially
alienated and without work, shaved heads, racist slogans,
black-leather attire and para-military discipline have proved an
appealing route to an elusive sense of identity and togetherness.
</P>
<P>
   ``As many people as possible have to say we don't want to let a
group of outlawed madmen destroy what we've built up over the past
55 years,'' Spiegel said. A number of recent incidents, including
the latest, have occurred in western Germany, suggesting that
rightist groups may be broadening their appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, the Schroeder government had given scant attention to
rightist violence, concentrating its efforts on deregulating the
German economy. But it has become clear to Schroeder that his aim
of making Germany a competitive ``global player'' _ to use a phrase
in vogue in his coalition _ is scarcely compatible with repetitive
outbreaks of nationalist thuggery.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest incidents, a total of 11 graves in the villages of
Rockenhausen and Dielkirchen, near Kaiserslautern, were desecrated.
The police said Nazi swastikas and SS slogans were daubed on
headstones in light gray paint.
</P>
<P>
   The desecration of Jewish cemeteries is not uncommon in Germany.
Last year more than 100 headstones were smashed or overturned in
Berlin's Weissensee cemetery, and Julius Schoeps, an expert on
German Jewish affairs, said that there had been more than a
thousand cases of desecration in the years after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 2,300 Jewish cemeteries in Germany, reflecting
centuries of Jewish presence in a country where more than 500,000
Jews lived before Hitler's rise to power. In many places,
particularly smaller towns and villages, these cemeteries
constitute the last trace of Jewish life in the area.
</P>
<P>
   In the northern Bavarian town of Bamberg, police found an
explosive device outside a Jewish family's home after it was
spotted by a neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``After recent incidents, people have become more vigilant,'' a
police spokesman said.

`BEN, IN THE WORLD':   HIS WEIRDNESS ATTRACTS   THE EVEN MORE
WEIRD 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Publication notes appear at end of review.)  
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twelve years ago, Doris Lessing wrote a grisly little horror
tale called ``The Fifth Child,'' a sort of highbrow ``Rosemary's
Baby,'' which recounted the story of a monstrous child born into a
middle-class London family. The child, Ben, looks like a grotesque
gnome or troll and displays an equally ugly personality: he kills
the family's dog and cat, tortures his brothers and sisters and
thoroughly disrupts the family's heretofore idyllic life.
</P>
<P>
   When the sequel to that book, ``Ben, in the World,'' opens, Ben
is 18 and on his own, roaming the streets of London. He now looks
like a yeti or caveman and still has fits of brutal anger. He
feasts on birds he catches with his bare hands, and when he sees
one of his brothers in a park he can barely suppress his murderous
rage.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this Ben is more sinned against than sinning. Whereas the
Ben in ``The Fifth Child'' was often an active agent of disruption,
the Ben in this volume is usually a victim, mocked and abused by
others who cannot accept his otherness.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger difference between the two books, however, lies in
the author's handling of Ben's story. In ``The Fifth Child''
Lessing created a perfect balance between naturalistic detail and
fablelike allegory. In fact the sense of terror that the book
generated in the reader stemmed in large measure from the
insinuation of a frightening, inexplicable creature into a
thoroughly ordinary, recognizable world; it was as if
Frankenstein's monster had been plunked down in a London _ or New
York _ suburb and sent to school with our children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben, in the World,'' in contrast, reads entirely like a fairy
tale, and a not very compelling one at that. All of the subsidiary
characters _ including a whore with a heart of gold and an evil Dr.
Mengele-type scientist who wants to perform strange experiments on
Ben _ are either kindly good Samaritans trying to help Ben or evil
villains out to exploit him. All of Ben's encounters with these
people have the contrived feel of incidents meant to illustrate
society's reaction to people who don't fit in.
</P>
<P>
   Because nothing feels very real in this novella, because Ben and
everyone else seem like cardboard cutouts, the reader feels neither
pity nor fear for the characters, only a vague sense of irritation.
``Ben, in the World,'' like the author's last novel, ``Mara and
Dann,'' points up a curious development in Lessing's recent
fiction: a seemingly arbitrary decision to jettison both the
visionary grandeur of the ``Canopus in Argos'' series and the
psychological nuance and social detail of her early ``Martha
Quest'' stories in favor of a more primitive, knee-jerk brand of
story telling.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of ``Ben, in the World,'' the story Lessing tells
consists of little more than a series of picaresque adventures that
take Ben from England to France to Brazil. In London Ben meets a
kindly old woman who takes him in off the streets and tries to care
for him. He next meets a hooker and her pimp, who decide to use him
as an unwitting accomplice in a drug deal: they load him up with
suitcases stuffed with cocaine, put him on a plane to Nice and
arrange for him to be met by a colleague.
</P>
<P>
   In Nice Ben is taken up by a would-be film director who wants to
make a movie starring him as a kind of Neanderthal alien. The
director takes Ben to Rio, where another former hooker befriends
him. She and her friends must later try to rescue Ben from a
villainous scientist who has kidnapped him and taken him to a
remote laboratory referred to as ``the bad place.'' The scientist,
not Ben, we're reminded, is the real monster _ ``a monster of
cruelty.''
</P>
<P>
   Lessing spends a great deal of space describing how this
scientist demeans Ben by locking him in a cage like an animal, but
she dwells at obnoxious length on Ben's animal-like appearance and
behavior. She describes him barking during sex and whimpering in
his sleep. She repeatedly discusses his hairy body, his heightened
sense of smell, his voracious appetite for raw meat.
</P>
<P>
   ``His hunger hurt and threatened him,'' she writes, ``It was not
an easy hunger: the thin taste of bread or a bun could not satisfy
it. It was a need for meat, and he smelled the rawness of blood,
the reek of it: yet this hunger was dangerous to him. Sometimes,
when he had gone into a butcher's shop, pulled there by the smell,
his body had seemed to engorge with wanting, and his arms stretched
out of their own accord towards the meat.''
</P>
<P>
   Such descriptions make Ben out to be some sort of generic
creature, endowed with only the most instinctual reactions and
responses, and Lessing does nothing to give him a discernible
personality. Her other characters are described in an even more
cursory manner, their fates dismissively summed up in a careless
sentence or two. We learn that the London hooker and pimp use their
cocaine profits to become part of the landed gentry: ``So you could
say that this part of our tale had a happy ending.'' We learn that
the Brazilian ex-hooker and her boyfriend marry and start a new
life: ``So their story at least has a happy ending: things turned
out well for them.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Ben, Lessing concocts a fate for him that's as
preposterous as it's predictable. A fitting end, in a way, for such
a flimsy, crudely written story.

 &HT;    LIEBERMAN TOOK A LONELY AND UNUSUAL ROUTE TO THE NATIONAL TICKET
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a town where the first rule of political success
has long been ``go along to get along,'' Joseph I. Lieberman has
bucked his party's positions and spoken out against its leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The second-term Connecticut senator rose to national fame two
years ago when he became the first of his Democratic colleagues to
deliver a public rebuke to President Clinton for having an affair
with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such behavior is not just inappropriate,'' Lieberman said in
extended remarks from the Senate floor. ``It is immoral.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman spoke out despite a friendship dating back to 1970,
when Clinton, then a law student at Yale University, helped
Lieberman campaign for Connecticut's state Senate. Even a
telephoned plea from Clinton during a trip to Moscow failed to
dissuade the senator from delivering the stinging criticism.
Lieberman's only concession was to wait until Clinton had left
Russia and landed in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't the first time Lieberman had challenged the
integrity of the Clinton administration. In 1997, he was the only
Democrat on a Senate investigating committee who asked tough
questions about the Democratic campaign finance scandals of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   A central element in that scandal was the role of Vice President
Al Gore, who Tuesday plans to name Lieberman as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman stopped short of blaming Gore personally, but he had
harsh words for the now-famous fund-raising event attended by Gore
at a Buddhist temple. Calling the event ``surreal,'' Lieberman
warned in a Senate report that there would be more ``hustlers
trying to put their change into the subway turnstile at the White
House gate.''
</P>
<P>
   Soft-spoken and courtly, Lieberman has hardly been a
flame-thrower on Capitol Hill. Instead, he has quietly tried to
rechannel the mainstream of his party, on both values and issues.
</P>
<P>
   As head of the Democratic Leadership Council, a group of
moderates that Clinton helped form, Lieberman has pushed for
greater emphasis on a strong defense, more parental choice for
education, including experimentation with vouchers for private
schools, and including some form of individual investing in the
Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Republican National Committee on Monday produced a
long list of issues where Lieberman is closer to Republican nominee
George W. Bush than to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But what largely distinguishes Lieberman's career has been a
concern over a moral decline that has sometimes brought him into
strange alliances.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some of the leaders of his party who have visited
Hollywood chiefly to gather big bucks for campaigns, Lieberman took
the entertainment industry to task for sex and violence. His
campaign was credited for helping pressure the TV networks into
developing a rating system to help parents guide their children's
viewing habits.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has continued to monitor the system and to criticize
it as inadequate. He once called the system ``a turkey.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining forces with William Bennett, a former education
secretary and staunch Republican conservative, Lieberman took aim
at ``gangsta rap'' music for glamorizing criminal behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Taking such stands is an outgrowth of Lieberman's faith, which
he wears much more openly than many in public office. An observant
Orthodox Jew, he works on the Jewish sabbath, between sundown
Friday night and sundown Saturday, only when necessity demands it.
</P>
<P>
   He has cast Senate votes on the sabbath, including during the
Clinton impeachment trial, even if it meant walking home 4 1/2
miles to avoid breaking rules against using conveyances. He has
also attended national security meetings at the White House on the
sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only is he allow to perform duties that would benefit the
public, but he is obligated to'' by Jewish law, said his
administrative assistant, Bill Andresen (cq). ``There is no
conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   However, campaigning is another matter. Lieberman has twice
skipped his own state Democratic nominating convention to observe
the sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   Usually that is private time for Lieberman, a family man whose
father owned a Stamford, Conn., liquor store where he read
philosophy and the Torah between customers.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman and his wife, Hadassah, have practicend-term
Connecticut senator rose to national fame two years ago when he
became the first of his Democratic colleagues to deliver a public
rebuke to President Clinton for having an affair with White House
intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such behavior is not just inappropriate,'' Lieberman said in
extended remarks from the Senate floor. ``It is immoral.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman spoke out despite a friendship dating back to 1970,
when Clinton, then a law student at Yale University, helped
Lieberman campaign for Connecticut's state Senate. Even a
telephoned plea from Clinton during a trip to Moscow failed to
dissuade the senator from deliverin

   CAMILLA-VICTIMS _ Six months after a tornado struck Camilla,

   BILINGUAL-AMERICA _ BOSTON _ This summer, three former
housekeepers filed suit against a posh Boston hotel claiming they
were forced to speak English instead of Spanish by their managers.
As immigrants from non-English-speaking countries flow into the
United States, businesses and institutions increasingly face a
foreign-language test: How best to cope with new workers and new
customers whose first language is not English. The notion of
English as the sole language of American business and political
life is being challenged, swamped by new demographic and market
realities. The demand for translators and translation services has
soared. Hispanics spent about $380 billion last year on products
and services, up 84 percent since 1990. On Capitol Hill, lawmakers
are

   GRAPES _ BOONVILLE, N.C. - In the four decades he's grown
tobacco, Frank Hopson never worried about the rising and setting of
the sun. ``Tobacco's a weed,'' and will grow just about anywhere,
he always figured. But now one of a fast growing number of North
Carolina farmers growing grapes to supply area vineyards,
57-year-old Hopson has learned to pay attention to sunshine and
other considerations critical to growing sweet, firm grapes. The
payoff? A crop that agricultural experts say won't replace North
Carolina's embattled, nearly billion-dollar-a-year crop, but one
that is acre for acre as profitable as tobacco.

thousands of Russians, bored or disenchanted with traditional
religions, do. (Coker, Cox News Service).

a choice between a mini-bus driver, a shop owner and a fellow
farmer. That the election took place in China is a sign to some -
especially those at the Carter Center, who are working with China
on standardizing village elections _ that this communist country is
on a slow but steady course towards democracy. To others, village

found UPS had committed a ``sham transaction.'' As a result, the

in tax history - up to $2.3 billion in back taxes, interest and
penalties. UPS has appealed the ruling and the 11th Circuit
considers it next month. (Hirschman, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

 &HT;    Wildcats' hopes rest on arm of 275-pound quarterback
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Alabama defensive end Kenny Smith was standing in the
lobby of a Birmingham, Ala., hotel last month when a reporter asked
him if he'd seen Kentucky's new quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``That dude with the blond hair?'' Smith asked. ``He's a
quarterback? Nah, he's got to be a lineman.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith was staring down Kentucky redshirt freshman Jared
Lorenzen, who was named the Wildcats' starting quarterback this
summer. At 6 feet 4 and 275 pounds, Lorenzen isn't your everyday
signal-caller.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a quarterback?'' Tennessee linebacker Eric
Westmoreland asked after catching a glimpse of Lorenzen at SEC
Media Days. ``I've only hit linemen that big.''
</P>
<P>
   Lorenzen is bigger than a lot of linemen. He outweighs
Kentucky's starting tight end and three of its four defensive
linemen who were projected starters going into preseason camp. He
is the heaviest quarterback in Division I-A, outweighing his
closest competitor _ UNLV's Jason Thomas _ by more than 30 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Lorenzen) is never going to be a small guy; he'll always be
huge,'' Kentucky coach Hal Mumme said. ``He hasn't seen 230
(pounds) since the eighth grade.''
</P>
<P>
   Mumme is hoping his oversized quarterback can help the Wildcats
overachieve this season. He first met Lorenzen four years ago when
the sophomore from Highlands High School in Fort Thomas, Ky.,
attended the Wildcats' summer camp.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of camp, Lorenzen told Mumme he wanted to be
Kentucky's quarterback one day. Mumme responded, ``You might be an
offensive lineman for me.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mumme's assessment of Lorenzen changed when he saw his left
arm. Lorenzen won every competition at Kentucky's ``Top Gun'' camp.
He threw the ball 72 yards; nobody else threw it past 60.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats were one of the few teams that recruited Lorenzen
as a quarterback, even after he led Highlands High to the Class AAA
state championship as a senior. In his final prep season, Lorenzen
passed for 3,392 yards and 45 touchdowns and was named the state's
``Mr. Football.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ohio State, Purdue and all of the other Big 10 schools were
recruiting me as a lineman,'' Lorenzen said. ``They told me they
weren't going to play me at quarterback. Coach Mumme was the first
and only head coach to call me. I knew he would give me a chance at
quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Lorenzen didn't expect to get the starting job this
quickly. Last season, Kentucky quarterback Dusty Bonner led the SEC
in passing efficiency and averaged 297 yards per game. The Valdosta
native completed 65 percent of his passes and threw an SEC-high 26
touchdowns. Bonner also guided the 'Cats to their second bowl game
in a row, a feat the program had not accomplished since 1983-84.
</P>
<P>
   After spring drills, Mumme said however, Mumme changed his mind.
He called Lorenzen into his office and told him that he'd start the
Sept. 2 opener at Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shocked the heck out of me,'' Lorenzen said. ``He told me I
was going to start. I didn't have a clue. I was speechless.''
</P>
<P>
   So was Bonner, who transferred to Division I-AA Valdosta State a
few days after Mumme's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Dusty made the right decision,'' Mumme said. ``In
our system, two quarterbacks don't work well in the equation. The
receivers need continuous repetitions with the quarterback. That's
why we will always be a one-quarterback school.''
</P>
<P>
   Mumme was discouraged by Bonner's play late last season, when
the Wildcats averaged only 18 points and lost three of their final
four games, and he prefers Lorenzen's arm, which he claims is
stronger than Tim Couch's.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is accurate and has great touch. There is not a drawback to
Jared,'' Mumme said. But Mumme's decision is still a risky one.
After three non-conference games against Louisville, South Florida
and Indiana, the Wildcats open their SEC schedule with road games
at Florida and Mississippi. Lorenzen will face two of the SEC's
more intimidating environments early in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it puts more pressure on me because we don't have an
experienced quarterback behind me,'' Lorenzen said. ``If people
realize I'm going to have some bumps in the road, I think we'll be
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   After Mumme's controversial about-face, Lorenzen isn't the only
one who will be judged by his performance this season.

   LIEBERMAN-ASSESS (Washington) _ After struggling mightily for
two years to move out of President Clinton's shadow, Vice President
Al Gore, in a bold but risky choice of a running mate, effectively
thrust Clinton and impeachment front and center in the 2000
presidential campaign. It was clear from the Republican convention
last week that the Republicans will not be timid in making the
moral lapses of Clinton a basic subtext of their campaign. The
thinking of the Gore camp is that by picking Lieberman, the most
vociferous critic of Clinton during the impeachment proceedings,
Gore will confront such criticism head on and underscore his
independence from the President. While no one can predict how the
Lieberman choice will play _ pr play out _ one thing is certain: It
was not a play-it-safe choice as was Gov. George W. Bush's
selection of Dick Cheney. There several obvious plusses to the
Lieberman choice _ but there are also several minuses. A news

<TEXT>
<P>
   Tucked in the backyard of a rapidly developing suburban
community on Johnson's Island in Lake Erie, 206 gleaming white
marble tombstones rise in perfect rows from carefully manicured
grass. The stones are marked with names, military ranks and the
occasional ``unknown,'' but no dates. These sons of the Confederacy
rest while one of their own _ in the form of a bronze statue _
stands guard. Oddly, the statue does not face south. Instead, it
looks out over the lake to Canada, less than 10 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The graveyard, on the 300-acre island in northwest Ohio, is all
that remains of a 40-acre Civil War prisoner of war camp that held
some 2,800 Confederate officers and enlisted men from 1862 to 1865.
``You're walking around and you'll see `so-and-so from Fifth
Alabama Infantry,''' said Dick Spicer, president of the Port
Clinton, Ohio, Chamber of Commerce, when we stopped by to pick up
some maps and brochures. ``It's not something you see very often in
the North.''
</P>
<P>
   The cemetery is but one memorial among dozens on the Lake Erie
islands, a region saturated with pivotal, and forgotten, history.
As boys, my friend Ben and I had made annual pilgrimages to Cedar
Point, the amusement park in Sandusky that overlooks the cemetery.
In college, we made a beeline for the bars on South Bass Island.
Now, as adults, we were going back to the playground of our
adolescence, and discovering a fascinating side of the region.
Within a day of our visit in late April, I felt as if I was living
in a history textbook.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are about a dozen islands in the lake, people
live year-round on just six of them, including Johnson's Island.
Each has a distinct character. South Bass Island, also known as
Put-in-Bay, is the most popular. It fancies itself Ohio's answer to
Key West, complete with a strip of bars with names like the Round
House and the Beer Barrel Saloon. Kelleys Island, the largest
American territory in the lake, is quieter and quaint with a rich
history of winemaking. Middle Bass and North Bass Islands are less
populated and have few tourist amenities. Pelee Island, Canada's
southernmost inhabited point, and Lake Erie's largest island, is
another wine-growing area that produces potent, sweet ice wines.
The other islands are either privately owned or too small to be
hospitable.
</P>
<P>
   It was off the Lake Erie Islands that an epic naval battle in
1813 decided the northern boundaries of the United States. Later,
as bored Confederate prisoners played poker with useless
Confederate money on Johnson's Island, Jay Cooke, a banker who sold
war bonds to to help the North finance the Civil War, bedded down
in his summer castle on Gibraltar Island, only a few miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Across from Gibraltar, South Bass Island became a watering hole
at the turn of the century, as steamships delivered tens of
thousands of people on weekends to drink at the myriad saloons and
stay at what claimed to be the world's first fully electrified and
largest wood-frame hotel, the Victory. In 1919, it burned in a
spectacular fire that was visible in Detroit, some 60 miles away.
The Lonz Winery, operating on Middle Bass Island since the 1800s
and the largest wine producer in the United States by 1875, was a
popular destination. But it was forced to close in July after a
terrace collapsed, killing a visitor and injuring 75 others.
</P>
<P>
   People still tell how during Prohibition, most residents of the
islands were connected to the rum-running operation of crime gangs
on Middle Island, just over the border in Canadian waters and just
out of reach of the United States officers. Other historic
attractions _ the oldest continuously operating lighthouse on the
Great Lakes in Marblehead, mysterious mansions and shipwrecks
galore _ complement such natural wonders as huge underground caves
and ancient glacial grooves. It would take a few weeks to explore
the histories and intricacies of every island and the Ohio
mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the ghost stories. On a stormy night in 1915, a
group of Italian laborers on Johnson's Island reported seeing the
Confederate statue turn to face the graves. When it blew its bugle,
ghostly soldiers emerged from the mist, the laborers said, stood at
attention in rotting gray uniforms, and marched away. A dozen men
killed in an 1840s quarry accident on Kelleys Island were rumored
to take their revenge by throwing a chain around ship propellers,
causing at least some of the 40,000 shipwrecks in the Great Lakes
in the last 200 years.
</P>
<P>
   On the mainland, trailer parks, marinas and low budget hotels
sit alongside tacky attractions like miniature golf courses and a
``prehistoric forest'' filled with life-size dinosaur models. The
islands, however, have kept their well-preserved Victorian villages
and avoided the mainland clutter.
</P>
<P>
   South Bass Island alone has at least 130 buildings that are
recorded by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office for historical or
architectural significance, and all of Kelleys Island is on the
National Register of Historic Places. Bed-and-breakfasts abound;
with the exception of a Dairy Queen and a Taco Bell in Put-in-Bay,
there isn't a name-brand restaurant or hotel chain to be found on
the islands.
</P>
<P>
   Ben and I spent an hour roaming the Confederate graveyard and
drove across the causeway that connects Johnson's Island to the
mainland, where we caught a ferry to Put-in-Bay. As we inched
closer to South Bass Island, I was surprised to see how flat it is.
South Bass was carved by the same glaciers that made the Great
Lakes tens of thousands of years ago, and is as low-lying as any
cornfield in central Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The island's dominant feature, Perry's Victory and International
Peace Memorial, is a Doric column of pink granite. Rising 352 feet
from an isthmus in the middle of the island, it is visible from all
the islands and most of the mainland, and is the third tallest
national memorial in the United States, after the the Gateway Arch
in St. Louis and the Washington Monument.
</P>
<P>
   It was constructed between 1912 and 1915 to commemorate
Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry's daring victory over the British
fleet during the Battle of Lake Erie on Sept. 10, 1813. After the
battle, Commodore Perry wrote his immortal telegram to President
William Henry Harrison: ``We have met the enemy, and they are
ours.''
</P>
<P>
   As the memorial grew closer, the significance of that battle
began to sink in. Less than 10 miles west of where we were sailing,
Commodore Perry and a racially diverse crew of sailors and soldiers
had defined the borders of a young United States and left the door
open for Manifest Destiny.
</P>
<P>
   Had the commodore lost, ``we probably would have ended up with
at least all the water in the Great Lakes belonging to Great
Britain and Canada,'' Edwin R. Isaly, curator of the Lake Erie
Islands Historical Society in Put-in-Bay, told us when we stopped
in to browse the society's impressive collection. Among its
treasures are expansive murals of the Battle of Lake Erie, models
of famous ships that have sailed the Great Lakes and antiques
rescued from the the Victory Hotel fire.
</P>
<P>
   We docked at the lime kiln dock on the southwest tip of the
island and drove a few minutes to the middle of the island for a
closer look at the Perry monument.The Canadian and American flags
flew side by side in a 25-acre park surrounding the monument,
symbolizing the longest unguarded international border in the
world. Around us, actors clad in period costumes re-enacted life as
it was in 1813.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the monument, we were greeted with a panoramic
view encompassing the Michigan mainland, Kelleys Island, the
120-year-old Cedar Point amusement park, Middle Bass and North Bass
Islands and the southern shore of Ontario. We also had fantastic
views of Pelee Island in Canada and the gangster haven of Middle
Island on the international border, where the remains of a
Prohibition-era casino and bordello is the only structure still
standing.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, we could see Put-in-Bay, which looks like a
Hollywood version of a New England fishing village _ only you're
more likely to find fried perch or walleye than ocean fish to go
with your beer. They do consume a lot of beer in Put-in-Bay,
especially in the stretch of bars along Delaware Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   We could hear the strains of ``Love Shack'' by the B-52s coming
from the Round House bar as we walked along Bay View Avenue to
DeRivera Park, a leafy square with playgrounds, gardens, gazebos
and a bathhouse that separates the marina from the strip of bars in
grand, Colonial-style buildings. The abundance of antique cars
idling around the park only added to the town's ``Ragtime''
ambience.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   In DeRivera Park, a row of 19th-century cannons aim across the
bay at Cooke Castle on Gibraltar Island, which has the highest
elevation of the islands and was used by Commodore Perry as a
lookout before the Battle of Lake Erie. Although the island is
close enough to swim to, visitors are allowed only by special
permission from Ohio State University, which owns Gibraltar. The
University frequently sponsors a weekly lecture series during the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Before we joined the party on Delaware Avenue, Ben and I checked
into a hotel. We sampled two neighboring Put-in-Bay lodgings. Our
rooms at each were clean and serviceable but far from luxurious.
</P>
<P>
   The first hotel, the two-year-old Islander Inn on Erie Street,
fit in well with Put-in-Bay's party atmosphere, with a Caribbean
resort theme, inclusing brightly appointed rooms and an outdoor
pool with swim-up bar. Nearby, Parker's Inn on Catawba Avenue was
more sober, with a neutral decor, and emphasized that it would not
tolerate rowdiness.
</P>
<P>
   At the Erie Isle Tavern in Parker's Inn, Ben enjoyed salmon
roulades stuffed with goat cheese, pine nuts, spinach and
portobello mushrooms. I opted for the tender filet mignon
medallions. The tavern's extensive wine list offered a classy
alternative to the fraternity row scene around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, we took a ferry to Kelleys to investigate the
quieter side of the islands. On Lakeshore Drive, stately
turn-of-the-century homes line the road, most with wraparound
porches, impeccably manicured lawns and a lake view. By the time we
arrived at the two-block downtown, Kelleys seemed like the antidote
to Put-in-Bay's excesses. The 150 or so permanent residents appear
to want to keep it that way, if the many ``no trespassing signs''
are any indication. some residents of Kelleys are so wary of
encroaching tourism that they ``moved over to Pelee Island to get
away from the crowds,'' said Robby Zettler, co-owner of the
Kelley's Island Wine Co. on Woodford Road. This lone survivor from
two dozen wineries that made the island famous in the 19th century
is now one of its most popular restaurants. Zettler served us a
plate of bread and cheeses with a sampler of the winery's dry wines
as she described the quirks of the island.
</P>
<P>
   On the northwest side, for example, 396-foot-long, 30-foot wide
glacial grooves illustrate the raw power of the geological forces
of the ice age. On the other side of the island is Inscription
Rock, a 32-by-21-foot limestone boulder covered with pictographs of
animals and people carved by the Erie Indians, who spent summers
here in the 1600s.
</P>
<P>
   There is also plenty of kitsch. Near inscription rock, a
seven-foot white plaster model of the Statue of Liberty stands in
front of a Victorian bed-and-breakfast, Kelley Mansion. A sign in
the yard boasts improbably that it is ``the most famous mansion in
the world.'' Its most famous feature is a grand, self-supporting
circular staircase built without nails.
</P>
<P>
   During the summer, there are tours and overnight stays, but Ben
and I were too early _ the windows were still boarded up and the
lawn was overgrown, giving the weathered mansion a sinister
appearance. ``It's the kind of place where you look around,'' Ben
said, ``and you keep expecting someone to be looking back at you.''
</P>
<P>
   Odds are, that someone would be wearing gray and carrying a
musket.
</P>
<P>

ferry runs every half hour from 7 a.m. until 8 p.m. in summer, but
there can be long waits on Friday and Sunday. The 18-minute trip
costs $5 each way, $1 for children ages 6 to 11. It costs an
additional $2 each way for a bicycle and $10 for a car. A car is
not necessary since it is easy to rent golf carts on the islands.

 &HT;    Stocks, mutuals excite some sports superstars
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - The image of sports superstars as spoiled kids
squandering money by the ton is not a complete picture, says Money
(September), the personal finance magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every clown blowing a signing bonus on a puce Bentley and
a dozen gold Rolexes, there is at least one eager student of
finance who brings a laptop to practice and talks asset allocation
in the locker room,'' the magazine says in a profile of sports
investors.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA's Shaquille O'Neal favors tech stocks such as Lucent and
AOL; basketball great Michael Jordan is mostly in large-cap mutual
funds at the moment; and NASCAR winner Dale Earnhardt likes _ what
else? _ GM and Goodyear.
</P>
<P>
   Five hefty quarters
</P>
<P>
   Economists predicted that corporate profits would be good to
strong in the second quarter, and they were right, Business Week
(Aug. 14) reports.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings increased 17 percent for the 900 companies the magazine
monitors, making it the fifth straight quarter of double-digit
earnings growth. Not surprisingly, one of the biggest gains came in
the energy sector, where coal, oil and gas companies posted a 187
percent year-over-year gain.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest growth was in the ``new economy'' semiconductors
industry, up 271 percent. The biggest casualty was the ``old
economy'' steel industry, which lost money. Health care, banks and
publishing industries also suffered big declines.
</P>
<P>
   Tax-free and rewarding
</P>
<P>
   Did somebody say ``munis''? Once regarded as the investment
choice of widows and orphans, municipal bonds are winning fans in
the most unlikely of places, Barron's (Aug. 7) reports.
</P>
<P>
   Dot.com millionaires have been buying tax-exempt bonds as a
hedge against the volatility of tech stocks. That's because the
tax-free yield on munis of, say 5.85 percent, is equivalent to a
9.69 percent taxable yield to an investor in the top bracket.
</P>
<P>
   Clicking without film
</P>
<P>
   Digital imaging has been seen by some analysts as the death
knell for old-fashioned photography, and with it companies such as
Kodak, the world's best-known photo company.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, says Forbes (Aug. 21), which notes that Kodak Chief
Executive Dan Carp sees digital images as ``an explosive
opportunity'' for the film company, not the kiss of death.
</P>
<P>
   If he's right, says Forbes, Kodak is an undervalued company. But
if he's wrong, it's lights out in Rochester, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Fast Company (September) devotes 100 of its 400 pages to the
tech magazine's second annual analysis of the ``new economy,''
including the comments of 17 people ``on the cutting edge of the
Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Pro sports is big business in metro Atlanta, with an estimated
$4.5 billion economic impact during the past five years, Georgia
Trend (August) reports. One reason is the breadth of the sports
menu, from baseball to football to basketball to motor sports, and
then some.

 c.2000 Newhouse News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The news Monday that Vice President Al Gore would name an
Orthodox Jew, Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, as his running
mate adds to the growing evidence that a candidate's religion is of
diminishing importance in national politics and that religious
prejudice is in decline as a factor in elections and high
appointive office, particularly for Jewish candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But many Jews don't believe it, and they fear awakening latent
anti-Semitism should they become too politically powerful.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the all-but-nominated Democratic standardbearer, is
expected to announce his choice of Lieberman on Tuesday in
Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton named two Jewish jurists in succession to the
Supreme Court -- Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Steven Breyer --
without much more than routine notice.
</P>
<P>
   And increasingly, Jewish candidates across the country are being
elected to local and national office by non-Jewish voters.
America's 6 million Jews, about 2 percent of the nation's total
population, occupy 11 percent of the seats in the Senate. In the
House of Representatives, there are 23 Jewish members holding 5
percent of the seats.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish community leaders say it no longer much matters if a
candidate is Jewish. Jewish candidates win or lose, and are
nominated or passed over for nomination, but being Jewish is not
the reason when they are successful -- and it is not the reason
when they are unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   A Jewish Republican from Pennsylvania, Sen. Arlen Specter, made
an unsuccessful but serious bid for his party's 1996 presidential
nomination. Not all, but many, Jewish leaders believe it is now
reasonable to think a Jew could be elected president, assuming that
one was positioned to win the nomination of the Democratic or
Republican parties.
</P>
<P>
   All of that certainly could not have been said 30 or even 20
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But while many Jews take pride in the trend and believe it
should be celebrated, other Jews find the dramatic change
troubling. They worry that acceptance and success can never be
taken for granted, that a strain of anti-Semitism still lingers
below the surface of American society and could erupt if too much
attention is paid to too many Jews who become too prominent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, there some who are fearful of what non-Jews will say,
who are mindful of Jewish history and think it would be better for
Jews to be not seen and not heard, but that is a view of a
diminishing minority,'' said Jonathan Sarna, professor of American
Jewish History at Brandeis University,
</P>
<P>
   To Rep. Howard Berman, one of five Jewish members of the
California congressional delegation, such fears are a remnant of
the ``shtetl'' or ghetto mindset among a fearful ``old guard''
whose Angst-ridden doctrine warns, ``Do nothing to push the king,
or the mayor, or the governor.''
</P>
<P>
   But not entirely old guard.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Laszlo, a 30-something Washington-based pollster and
political consultant, who is Jewish, said she cannot feel
complacent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darwin said it is not the smartest or the strongest but those
best able to adapt who survive and adapt sometimes means keeping
your head down,'' Laszlo said.
</P>
<P>
   To Laszlo, history is the best guide. ``While there is no reason
to think there is any problem in America now, there was no reason
to worry in Austria where my father lived when they put a yellow
star on him,'' Laszlo said. ``We are the only community that, when
we fail to be accepted, it's not just a matter of being unable to
be in the country club, it's a matter of survival.''
</P>
<P>
   Laszlo admits her concerns are connected to her own experience
in 1994 when she failed to win the Democratic nomination for
Congress in a crowded primary in the Second District of North
Carolina, where she grew up. One competitor's tactic was to refer
to her as ``that Jew-girl from Durham,'' Laszlo recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Even if there were risk of igniting anti-Semitism, that should
not deter Jews from seeking public office, said Ira Forman,
executive director of the National Jewish Democratic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is always some kind of risk out front when you head
up,'' Forman said. ``Politics is about who gets what, when and how.
In America today, if you don't take the risk you're going to be
left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Forman is a Jew of the baby boom generation. ``I grew up in the
Midwest and I couldn't go to the country club two blocks from me,
but other than that I found relatively little discrimination,''
Forman said. ``I had two or three fights growing up when someone
called me a `damn Jew.' But my experience was not horrible. Yet you
can't say anti-Semitism doesn't exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Discussing his own unsuccessful campaign for the Republican
presidential nomination (which Bob Dole won), Specter said he did
not lose because he was Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of other factors,'' Specter said. ``It had a
lot more to do with my position on the political spectrum. I did
not appeal to Republican primary voters because I was too much of a
centrist.''
</P>
<P>
   But Specter insists that, if nominated, he would have had ``an
excellent chance'' of winning the presidency in the general
election.
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup poll of voters nationally in February of last year
found that 92 percent said they would be willing to vote for a
Jewish presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Specter challenges the notion that religion is
irrelevant to voters when the candidate is Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a latent adverse reaction to Jewish candidates
today,perhaps not as intense as it was in the past, but it's still
there. I don't know if it's a 5 percent factor or a 9 percent
factor or an 11 percent factor, but it's there.''
</P>
<P>
   And Specter is sympathetic to Jewish concerns about the number
of members of the Jewish community in high profile positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have too many Jews in office, it gives support to the
frequent contention that Jews control Wall Street, Hollywood,
television and the newspapers. Jews also worry that if a Jewish
officeholder screws up, the Jewish community will be blamed,''
Specter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not simple,'' Specter said. ``There's a tendency to say
that times have changed and you have minorities in all sorts of
positions, African-Americans and Hispanics. All that is true to an
extent, but you really wonder about how much tokenism there is and
how much bias and discrimination is close to the surface.''
</P>
<P>
   Others exude optimism. ``We've lived through Holocaust and
pogroms,'' said 84-year-old Hyman Bookbinder, a longtime lobbyist
on issues of concern to the Jewish community. ``We can't say the
battle is over, but the battle is substantially won.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in California, a state where both senators are Jewish,
many Jews still perceive anti-Semitism as a lurking threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a foreboding that Jews maintain that there may not be
a great deal of anti-Semitism now, but they don't want to admit
there might not be in future,'' said Earl Rabb, former director of
the Jewish Community relations Council in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   David Singer, who studies polling data for the American Jewish
Committee in New York, is struck by the gap between reality and the
Jewish perception of reality, between an increased willingness
among non-Jewish voters to vote for Jewish candidates, and the
disbelief among many Jews that this could be true.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend is greater and greater acceptance of Jewish
candidates,'' Singer said. ``It's perfectly clear that their
Jewishness is irrelevant. Yet among Jews, you would not believe the
amount of resistance you get to this. There's this strange mind
warp we're in. American Jews remain convinced that there is a lot
of anti-Semitism in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   It is another tragic legacy of the Holocaust, Singer said.
``It's this notion that `they hate us' and it doesn't matter how
much the situation changes.'' Singer calls it ``anticipatory
anti-Semitism -- a grim concern that things may be good at this
minute but who knows what's around the corner.''
</P>
<P>
   What's around the corner may be the first Jewish president,
according to Jason Isaacson, director of governmental affairs for
the American Jewish Committee in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``With each generation and each passing year, we are closer and
closer to the reality in which ethnicity ceases to matter in
American politics,'' Isaacson said.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a source of pride for various groups'' and nothing
less than ``a revolution'' in American society for Jews like
Isaacson, who remembers ``the bad old days when corporate board
rooms had few if any Jews; when Jews, with a few exceptions, were
essentially fenced off from access from elite preserves of society,
the best clubs, jobs and appointments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't say all the old stereotypes and old prejudices have
completely vanished, but certainly at the elite levels of politics
and academia and business those old walls have crumbled,'' Isaacson
said. ``Achievement and experience are the indices and standards by
which potential candidates are for the most part being judged.''
</P>
<P>
   As examples, Jews have assumed the presidency at Ivy League
universities where rigid quotas on Jewish admissions were once in
place. Alan Greenspan heads the Federal Reserve Board. Sandy Berger
is the White House national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   There are clearly hate groups and strains of society that do not
accept Jews and remain intolerant of minorities generally. ``But
the overwhelming portion of the population is generally tolerant
and supportive of diversity,'' Isaacson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quotas have vanished and limits on any ethnic or religious
group are no longer applicable, or even thinkable,'' Isaacson said.
``And if this is a permanent fixture in American society, and I
hope it is, America has genuinely changed.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Benjamin A. Cardin, a seven-term Democrat from Maryland, is
not convinced that religion has become irrelevant in politics.
``That's a little strong,'' he said. ``But it is clearly less of a
factor today than it was a decade or two ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Concern about a candidate's religion has been declining since
John F. Kennedy, the first and still the only Catholic to win the
presidency, broke that barrier in 1960, Cardin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a more diverse and tolerant society today,'' Cardin
said. ``People have gotten to know each other a lot better.''
Cardin believes the political process has matured enough ``to
permit a person qualified to be president who is Jewish to be able
to win,'' even if many Jews don't believe it yet.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   ``No one thought a Catholic could be president,'' Cardin said.
``Or, now, a woman, or an African-American. That's a stereotype
that will be broken in our lifetime. We're beyond that. Of course,
until it happens, nobody from the community involved will believe
it can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be a little soon to expect a Jewish president, according
to Sarna, the Brandeis professor. ``I expect we'll have a woman
president before we have a Jewish president,'' Sarna said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it seems to me we'll have a Jewish president at some point
in time. I can never remember a time when so many of the candidates
talked about as potential vice presidential material are Jewish.
That seems to be a very interesting feature of the current
election. It remains to be seen if it's just talk or if something
will come of it.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Lieberman, former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
and Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California were on early lists of
potential choices for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some things about this year's presidential race are
causing head-shaking in the Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both major candidates are using the religion card,'' said Abe
Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai
B'rith. ``Whether it's George W. Bush saying that Jesus is his
political philosopher or Gore making decisions based on `what Jesus
would do,' that's a problem. They are very specific.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are talking about Christ and Christianity. They are
saying that's how they would govern. In an autobiography, that's
one thing. When you go to church, that's wonderful. But on the
political platform, it takes on a different meaning. It plays on
church-state relationships, prayer in school, abortion, school
vouchers; it plays on all issues and that's anxiety-producing. It
brings about a sense of alienation not only to Jews but others,
Muslims, Buddhists, atheists and other ethnic groups. Don't forget,
we are becoming an amalgam of all kinds of religions and ethnic
groups.''
</P>
<P>
   (THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the cultural acceptance of Jews has been accompanied by
the diversity phenomenon that some Jews find less comforting.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a certain fear in the Jewish community that even as
individual Jews have certainly risen up into elite circles that the
Jewish community itself is in some ways less significant in the
world of American religion,'' Sarna said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once upon a time we talked about Protestants, Catholics and
Jews. Jews were one of America's `big three' religions,'' Sarna
said. ``Now there's a sense that America is a smorgasbord of
religions, of many minority faiths of which the Jewish community is
just one.''
</P>
<P>
   The change, Sarna said, is visible on ceremonial occasions.
Where once the priest, minister or rabbi once stood, a broader
selection of religious leaders now rise to deliver the
benedictions.

 c.2000 The New York Times  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   BERLIN _ Torsten Schmale and Christian Wessel started Inubit,
their Berlin-based business-to-business software and services
company, in December after their respective girlfriends decided
that they had had enough of listening to them complain about their
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The women, who work together at another company, persuaded Dr.
Schmale, who was bored with his job as a software developer for
Siemens, and Wessel, who was sick of his job as a consultant with
Roland Berger &AMP; Partners, a management consulting firm, to meet.
They did, and quickly hit upon an idea for a technology platform
that would enable business-to-business marketplaces. In doing so,
they joined a wave of business-to-business start-ups in Germany.
(After the business idea was hatched, the couples got married.)
</P>
<P>
   The beginnings of Germany's Internet start-up revolution can be
traced to June 1999, when eBay purchased Alando.de, a German online
auction company, for $43 million. Since then, the start-up scene
has accelerated, causing investor interest to shift from businesses
selling to consumers to those servicing other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The emerging business-to-business climate is healthy and likely
to continue growing. Indeed, Forrester Research, a market research
firm in Cambridge, Mass., predicts that by 2004, Germany will lead
Europe with 26 percent of all e-commerce activity, followed by
Britain, with 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The business-to-business landscape in Germany, however, will
look different from its early-stage counterpart in the United
States. A crucial difference is that in Germany, corporate players
are recognizing the importance of the business-to-business market
almost in tandem with start-ups. DaimlerChrysler, Bayer, Volkswagen
and Siemens are creating e-commerce marketplaces to procure goods
or have plans to do so, and both SAP and Intershop Communications
are also interested in expanding into such commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big companies were faster in realizing the potential of
business-to-business e-commerce in Germany than in the U.S.,'' said
Reinhard Edelmann, an investment manager with Technologieholding, a
Berlin venture-capital firm.
</P>
<P>
   One result, said Thorsten Wichmann, the chief executive of
Berlecon Research, a research and analysis firm also in Berlin, is
that ``niche markets are where start-ups are coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   Inubit is focusing on European niche markets, along with other
start-ups, including Newtron.de, Surplex.de and Portum.de. (The
``de'' stands for Deutschland.) Inubit has built a
business-to-business technology platform and is planning to join
with established companies to create industry-specific
marketplaces. So far, Inubit has one partner, the Floramedia Group,
a horticulture company with a pan-European presence.
</P>
<P>
   Even if big companies are quicker on the draw in Germany, enough
business-to-business start-ups have taken root in the last six
months to spawn more than 100 online marketplaces, according to
Berlecon's research.
</P>
<P>
   Inubit, as is typical for a German business-to-business company,
is fashioning itself as a European company _ one that needs to
adapt to multiple countries, cultures and languages from the
get-go.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at the European market, which is like the
worldwide market. From an organizational perspective, it's the
same,'' Wessel explained. ``If you're a B-to-B start-up in Germany,
it doesn't make sense to stay in the German market. We programmed
our technology so that if someone comes in and says he's from
Spain, he gets Spanish content.''
</P>
<P>
   This approach, according to Edelmann, of Technologieholding, is
what distinguishes European e-commerce ventures from American ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're used to dealing with other cultures,'' he said, ``and
Americans are not.''
</P>
<P>
   Many American companies add multiple language abilities to their
technology only after they stake a claim in the United States
market, Edelmann said, rather than integrating them from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Multiple languages are just the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The European market is not homogenous like the U.S. market,''
said Patrick Sheehan, the managing director for the United States
division of 3i Group, a venture capital firm in London. ``There are
quite different market conditions in each country.''
</P>
<P>
   European companies have to take into account the different
business processes, tax systems, cultures, market structures, labor
laws and governments from country to country.
</P>
<P>
   ``To address your market, you have to have a whole different set
of business approaches,'' Wessel said.
</P>
<P>
   Even the level of technological adoption _ which varies widely
from southern to northern Europe _ is an issue: A European
technology company must have different strategies for, say, wired
Sweden and analog Spain.

<P>
   Congress will soon begin debating the need for legislation to
protect consumer privacy on the Internet. The chances of such
legislation passing quickly are small, given that the issues are
complicated, the economic and political stakes are high and the
technology is changing constantly.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, though, there are many steps that consumers can
take to protect themselves. Many of these measures will prove
useful to Internet shoppers even if consumer-privacy laws become a
reality.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the use of ``cookies,'' which are pieces of computer
code dropped from Web sites onto users' hard drives. Cookies
collect information about sites visited, purchases made and
passwords created, as well as any personal information disclosed
during a Web-site visit.
</P>
<P>
   Cookies are not always bad. Benign ones make Web sites run
efficiently and help operate features such as online shopping
carts.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the recent brouhaha over privacy springs from a new
capability to correlate previously anonymous information with
people's e-mail and street addresses, which are sometimes reused or
even sold to third parties.
</P>
<P>
   This sharing can simply result in unwanted e-mail messages or
junk mail. But more disturbing is the possible disclosure of
sensitive information.
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible to browse without surveillance? No, not
completely _ but it is possible to move about the Internet in
stealth mode. Some methods are in the hands of Web users
themselves, others in the growing number of companies that sell
privacy as part of their packages.
</P>
<P>
   While Anonymizer.com was one of the earliest, there are now
literally hundreds of so-called remailers. These intermediaries
will remove all revealing information, such as your name or e-mail
address, from your e-mail messages before sending them on to their
destinations.
</P>
<P>
   The Electronic Privacy Information Center, at www.epic.org,
maintains a list of reliable remailers, and if you follow the links
on its Web site to ``privacy tools,'' it offers tips. There are
also encryption programs such as Zero-Knowledge Systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Infomediaries'' such as Enonymous and PrivaSeek act on behalf
of consumers, collecting personal information and providing to Web
sites only what the users allow.
</P>
<P>
   A new infomediary company, Youknowbest.com, is coming online
this summer. The company, based in Celebration, Fla., is expected
to work as if it were a combination consumer reporter, personal
shopper and guard dog. It will enable consumers to create private
profiles at the youknowbest.com Web site and to use the site to
solicit information _ from price to service records, from color to
safety _ for thousands of products. At the same time, the consumers
can review how youknowbest.com and other customers rank merchants
on adherence to privacy and security standards.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the various computer programs and Web-based
businesses that protect privacy, you can help safeguard it
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most important ways is to disclose as little personal
information as possible, says Jason Catlett, president of
Junkbusters.com, a company that works with other businesses to
develop what he calls consensual approaches to marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't give your identity online or, at the very least,
minimize the sites at which you register,'' he says. ``Under United
States law, there is almost no protection for data, and the
consumer has no recourse if information is misused.''
</P>
<P>
   The Junkbusters Web site, at www.junkbusters.com, offers
detailed instructions on how to use your browser to turn off
cookies, to alert you when a cookie is offered or to accept cookies
only from trusted sites. Junkbusters also offers a filter to
dispose of banner ads, which are used in tracking.
</P>
<P>
   For those with fond memories of playing cops and robbers, the
new company Guidescope Inc., at www.guidescope.com, has a product
that allows consumers to ``zap'' advertisements permanently,
thereby disposing of them not only from their own screens but also
from those of other Guidescope users. The banished ad is sent to a
central database that functions like a blacklist. When other
Guidescope users visit the Web source of the offending ad, they
won't see it at all.
</P>
<P>
   Catlett also advises consumers to maintain separate e-mail
accounts: one for personal messages, one for business and one for
ordering information or products. The last is easiest to abandon if
junk e-mail messages become intolerable.
</P>
<P>
   Catlett does not think that the privacy policies posted on many
Web sites are worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are vague and often incomprehensible,'' he says, ``and
always subject to change.''
</P>
<P>
   If you insist on perusing the policies, he adds, watch for seals
from business-monitoring groups that attest to the companies'
adherence to consumer-privacy standards.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Geraghty, the director of marketing at youknowbest.com, says
that caution is essential.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is the only two-way media that most people
consume,'' Geraghty says, ``and it's very powerful. You buy a TV,
and RCA doesn't know what you watch. You buy the newspaper, and no
one there knows what section you read first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your computer, on the other hand, is telling your secrets
without your knowledge,'' he says. ``Our take is that this is your
information, not theirs.''

 By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ West Nile virus appears to be settling in for the
long haul.
</P>
<P>
   Almost one year after the Western Hemisphere debut of the virus
sent 62 people to hospitals, eventually killing 7 of them with
severe brain inflammation, the bird-carried, mosquito-transmitted
disease has struck again, infecting a 78-year-old man from Staten
Island.
</P>
<P>
   The man, who became ill last month before mosquito spraying
began, recovered, as the vast majority of infected people do.
</P>
<P>
   But despite widespread spraying, many scientists expect that a
scattering of such cases and a few deaths, mostly in the elderly or
infirm, may well become the norm in years to come.
</P>
<P>
   More slowly than expected, but steadily, the globe-hopping virus
is dispersing from last year's focal point in northern Queens
County, part of New York City, leaving a trail of dead birds that
so far extends north to Boston, then west to Syracuse, N.Y., and
south to Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   According to virus experts, this pattern indicates that West
Nile, which was first identified in Uganda in 1937 and flares up
sporadically in Africa, Europe and the Middle East, appears
ensconced in the New World.
</P>
<P>
   Since last fall, dozens of scientists have been scrambling to
understand West Nile's origin and destiny as it travels this
continent and tests new hosts, decimating some, like crows, leaving
others, like pigeons, untouched, and occasionally infecting people.
Thousands of hours of sleuthing, testing and analysis are only now
offering preliminary clues. The big questions are largely
unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   How did the virus get here? Where did it come from? What is its
main animal reservoir _ the birds in which it can simmer in
sufficient concentrations to be passed by mosquitoes from one host
to another? How far will it spread?
</P>
<P>
   Most important, will West Nile pose a major threat to public
health in the United States? The answer to this question, at least
so far, appears to be no.
</P>
<P>
   Though the virus was first identified in Uganda, the source of
the outbreak here was probably Israel; the American strain is
almost indistinguishable from a virulent strain found in a goose on
an Israeli farm in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   House sparrows _ ubiquitous, dust-colored, one-ounce
crumb-snatchers _ are probably a principal reservoir here; new
tests at federal laboratories show they can harbor the virus for
five days or more at levels high enough to infect mosquitoes that
bite them.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, little is known.
</P>
<P>
   Given the lack of knowledge about what conditions set off the
virus' spread to people, the major response so far _ spraying near
spots where birds have died _ is akin to shooting at an assailant
in the dark, many scientists say. And while surveillance and
spraying can help cut the risk that people will be infected, the
virus is probably here to stay and will continue to spread.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're beyond containment now,'' said Dr. Robert G. McLean, a
government biologist studying West Nile's impact on birds. ``We
have to live with it and do the best we can.''
</P>
<P>
   The closest thing to an absolute fact in the investigation of
the disease, scientists say, is that it is truly new in the
Americas, arriving somewhere around New York City in the months
before last summer's outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   Blood tests in people and birds showed the kind of immune
response typical when a body is freshly exposed to an infection,
according to federal health officials. Mapping of test results for
captured house sparrows _ which do not migrate _ show a hump in the
exposure rate in and around Queens and nowhere else.
</P>
<P>
   And crows, the most vulnerable birds, are almost nowhere to be
seen in northern Queens this summer. The population there crashed
90 percent, federal scientists say, while in other areas the birds
were hit less hard.
</P>
<P>
   West Nile virus is closely related to several other
mosquito-borne viruses found around the world, including Japanese
encephalitis and St. Louis encephalitis, which has a similar cycle
in birds and mosquitoes and occasionally strikes people across the
South and Middle West.
</P>
<P>
   One big difference is that St. Louis encephalitis is ``silent''
in birds, generally not killing them, scientists say, so there is
usually no warning before a human case. For West Nile, at least the
American strain, birds, and particularly crows, offer a hint of
possible trouble to come.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The disease has caused epidemics in the past. In West Nile
outbreaks in Israel in the 1950s, South Africa in 1974 and Romania
in 1996, hundreds and sometimes thousands of people became ill,
with 5 percent to 10 percent of those cases proving fatal.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, scientists say, human illness from the virus will
probably remain rare since humans are likely to remain what
biologists call ``dead-end hosts'': they can be infected, but their
immune systems almost always prevent the virus from multiplying
enough to be passed back to mosquitoes and then to other hosts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's horrible for the few individuals who've been terribly
affected, but I don't see any way that it will cause more than a
dribble of cases here,'' said Dr. Paul W. Ewald, an infectious
disease expert at Amherst College.
</P>
<P>
   Still, West Nile has already defied expectations here, and
health officials want to be prepared, should the virus surprise
them again.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, the surprise was pleasant. The federal Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention issued an alert from New York to
Texas, offering money to states to track what was expected to be a
kind of rolling wave of dying birds as the annual southward
migration took place and the virus tagged along.
</P>
<P>
   But no southerly die-off was seen. And since then, the only new
discoveries of birds with the virus have come to the north, not the
south _ in Syracuse, and just outside of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Of growing concern to some biologists is the virus' potential
impact on American wild birds, including species like whooping
cranes, eagles and ravens, which seem susceptible.
</P>
<P>
   The imported West Nile strain, and the Israeli strain it most
resembles, are more dangerous to birds than other known strains of
the virus, said McLean. And the dead birds keep coming. In a
telephone interview on Aug. 4, McLean said a fresh shipment of 25
new birds had just come in from New York and, he predicted, ``it's
going to start picking up more and more.''
</P>
<P>
   While trying to stay a step ahead of the virus, scientists are
also looking back, trying to retrace how and why it finally found
its way across the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   This could help change the way health officials guard against
other so-called emerging diseases, said Dr. Martin Cetron, an
epidemiologist in the federal centers' quarantine division in
Atlanta, who is helping to direct the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   A team based at the centers devised a mathematical model to
determine a top-10 list of probable sources, Cetron said, which
mostly included things like shipments of poultry or pet birds. Only
one subset of people ranked in the top 10: travelers from Israel
whose immune systems were weak enough to allow the virus to thrive
long enough to be picked up by a New York mosquito and spread to
birds and, eventually, back to people. Cetron stressed that the
model was like a compass: it pointed in a certain direction, but
did not provide firm answers.
</P>
<P>
   The research has not yet been published, but Cetron described
some remarkable statistics the team came upon, which show just how
many possible carriers of the virus came to the New York region
through the three major airports in the year leading up to the
outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   From July 1998 to June 1999, 5 million people arrived with the
metropolitan region as their final destination. Of those, 2.1
million came from places where West Nile has been found.
</P>
<P>
   There were shipments of imported birds, horses, even frogs, all
of which can harbor the virus. More than one million live birds,
mostly poultry, were imported to New York City in that span.
</P>
<P>
   Now that West Nile is here, what is it capable of? No one has
been able to determine how the virus makes the leap to a human
outbreak from the circumstances now seen in southern New York _ a
scattering of bird deaths, one human case and a few dozen samples
of trapped mosquitoes carrying the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists say that conditions are not nearly as primed for
a significant human outbreak as they were last year. West Nile is
usually passed from birds to humans in late summer, in cities more
than the countryside and in weather or in places that mosquitoes
enjoy. The scientists note that frequent downpours this summer are
likely to have flushed storm drains that were stagnant last year
because of a prolonged drought. Stagnant, nutrient-laden water is a
welcome mat for Culex mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   This year, too, many communities revived mosquito control
efforts, including widespread use of larvacide, that had ended 10
or 20 years ago for lack of concern.
</P>
<P>
   Even with all the precautions underway, many scientists said, it
is likely that when the disease begins to strike people again, it
will come as a surprise. They just do not know whether West Nile,
in its new terrain, will play by established rules. ``We don't have
the luxury of a track record,'' said Roger S. Nasci, a mosquito
expert in the disease-control centers' laboratories at Fort
Collins, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   On the front lines in New York, scientists are racing to keep up
with a rising number of dead birds. In his laboratory near Albany,
Dr. Ward B. Stone, the state's wildlife pathologist, conducts
triage on a steady flow of crows, herons, hawks, bluejays and other
birds, quickly assessing which should be sent on for tests for the
new virus and which were killed by conventional causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``From mid-August until after Labor Day, we're going to see this
virus amplifying,'' Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he had no doubt that the current frenzied focus on
West Nile would eventually ebb, and that it would be added to the
growing list of diseases on the fringe _ never as familiar as flu,
rabies or meningitis, but something always to consider when a bird
dies, or an old man runs a fever in the summertime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will become one of the diseases in America that we have to
watch for,'' Stone said. ``And we should be getting ready for the
next one.''

 &HT;    Confederate sub to return to shore today
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SULLIVAN'S ISLAND, S.C. - This morning, as the barge carrying
the Confederate submarine H.L. Hunley nears Charleston Harbor, the
bells of Stella Maris Catholic Church will ring first.
</P>
<P>
   Other churches will join in during the historic sub's 13-mile
journey from the ocean floor where it sank 136 years ago to its
North Charleston conservation laboratory. As much as scientists,
history buffs and tens of thousands of others eagerly await a
glimpse of the historic Confederate relic, the sub's journey is
also a funeral procession.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did not have a proper burial,'' said Michael Osbourne,
the Stella Maris deacon who will signal the Hunley's approach to
bell ringers in the church's tower. ``It is simply a traditional
way of paying respect to the dead.''
</P>
<P>
   For the 14 men who died the night of Feb. 17, 1864, it's a trip
long overdue, organizers say.
</P>
<P>
   Five Union sailors died after the Hunley rammed the USS
Housatonic with a long spar affixed with a charge of black powder.
As the ship sank, marking the first time a sub had sunk another
warship, the Hunley backed away. Its crew flashed a blue light,
signaling fellow Confederates on shore that it was returning home.
</P>
<P>
   But the Hunley sank mysteriously, and its nine Confederate
crewmen also died.
</P>
<P>
   Today as the barge reaches the pier at the conservation lab,
Confederate re-enactors will flash a blue light, one of many
symbolic acts to welcome the Hunley home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are ringing for the crews of the Hunley and the Housatonic
who died that night,'' said the Rev. Lawrence McInerny, pastor of
Stella Maris, the church organizing the bell-ringing tribute. It
will ring its eight bells half muffled, a custom at memorials for
the dead.
</P>
<P>
   The Hunley, McInerny said, will be ``treated as a military
tomb.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 300 Confederate re-enactors will take up positions
along the Cooper River, firing cannons and rifles in salute as the
Hunley passes. Women dressed in Confederate garb will toss flowers
into the river from the deck of the retired USS Yorktown,
considered by organizers to be one of the best spots for viewing
the Hunley.
</P>
<P>
   Today's trip will be the public's first opportunity to glimpse
the sub, or at least its outline encased in metal supports, slings
and foam-filled bags intended to stabilize the vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Marietta, Ga.-based Flexible Products Co. donated the
foam-filled bags. One of the company's sales representatives, Bill
Youmans, a Savannah native with family ties to Charleston, has
traveled four times to the recovery site, four miles off Sullivan's
Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard so many stories about the Hunley from my grandfather
when I was a little boy that it was natural for me to get
involved,'' said Youmans, 51.
</P>
<P>
   A relatively small number of people have seen the Hunley's spar,
one of the sub's technological marvels already recovered by divers.
It is submerged in a shallow tank of water at the conservation lab.
</P>
<P>
   One who has seen the long orangish shaft is Jim Tapley, a
retired submarine mechanic from the now-closed Charleston Naval
Yard. A volunteer in today's Hunley activities, he was reluctant to
touch the spar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just to look at it, it was quite a thing,'' Tapley said.
</P>
<P>
   While the NAACP has protested another Civil War relic _ the
Confederate battle flag at the Statehouse _ the Hunley has drawn no
protests. ``We do not look at this as a North-South thing,'' said
Tapley, commanding officer of the Charleston Torpedo Division, a
group of naval re-enactors. ``We look at it as a groundbreaking
military treasure that we can now examine and learn from.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the lead scientists who in coming weeks will cut open the
Hunley's iron hull says she's keenly aware of the vessel's
historical significance, as well as the sensitivity of its probable
contents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a sardine can that we're opening,'' said Maria
Jacobsen, senior archaeologist at the Hunley conservation lab.
``These are human remains we are dealing with.''

LIEBERMAN'S MORAL EDGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Moral outrage has been a hallmark of Joseph I. Lieberman's
political career for two decades. His passionate voice and his
common-sense approach to many issues are welcome additions to the
debate.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, in choosing the two-term Connecticut
senator as his running mate, has picked a man with relatively
little national reputation or stature. Only once has Lieberman led
the news, when he criticized President Bill Clinton for his
behavior with Monica Lewinsky, saying ``It is immoral. And it is
harmful.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican convention made two strong statements, claiming
diversity for the GOP and tarring Gore for his relationship with
Clinton. Lieberman's selection _ as the first Jewish candidate for
national office and the first Democrat to criticize Clinton _
blunts both Republican initiatives effectively. But if Gore's
choice is meant merely to inoculate him from GOP criticism, it is a
poor rationale.
</P>
<P>
   We hope and expect voters have grown beyond prejudging a
candidate based on religion. Vice presidential nominees should be
judged primarily for their ability to work with the presidential
candidate and to take over in the White House if necessary.
Lieberman still has much to prove.
</P>
<P>
   In his public career, he has been an independent thinker, often
with a moral edge. As attorney general of Connecticut, he
investigated a failed child support system, not only as a policy
issue but also from the principle that parents need to accept the
responsibility for raising their children. A genuine intellectual,
he wrote a book on the subject in 1985. Similarly, there has been a
tone to his support for campaign finance reform, for the V-chip to
screen out televised sex and violence, and for other issues that
has seemed sanctimonious at times and appropriately outraged at
others.
</P>
<P>
   He is more centrist than most of the others on Gore's short
list, supporting some privatization of Social Security and, more
troublingly, questioning affirmative action and supporting a pilot
school voucher plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' job now is to convince voters that Lieberman is a
good answer not just to the GOP's past convention, but for the
nation's future.

BEING CLEAR ABOUT SADDAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It may be true that party platforms nowadays are, for the most
part, artful patchworks of subliminal signals, lacking real
meaning. A promising exception to that rule is the two-paragraph
plank in the Republican Party platform concerning the unresolved
problem of Saddam Hussein's continued misrule in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP's critique of Clinton administration dithering in its
Iraq policy is on target.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration has pretended to support the removal of
Saddam Hussein from power, but did nothing when Saddam Hussein's
army smashed the democratic opposition in northern Iraq in August
1996,'' the Republican platform laments. ``The administration also
surrendered the diplomatic initiative to Iraq and Iraq's friends,
and failed to champion the international inspectors charged with
erasing Iraq's nuclear, biological, chemical, and ballistic missile
programs.''
</P>
<P>
   These are stipulations of fact, notwithstanding the partisan
intent of the platform's authors. What those Republican authors
omit, of course, is that former President George Bush, vice
presidential nominee Dick Cheney, and former chief of staff Colin
Powell were the decision-makers responsible for failing to support
the popular uprising of Iraqis in March 1991, just after the Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
   That revolt of soldiers and civilians could have toppled
Saddam's Baathist dictatorship if Bush, Cheney, and Powell had not
permitted its helicopter gunships, tanks, and heavy armor to move
through the airspace and land routes controlled by America's
victorious troops, enabling Saddam's forces to massacre Iraqis who
heeded the elder Bush's call for them to overthrow the dictator.
</P>
<P>
   If George W. Bush and Cheney could admit the errors the last
Republican administration made in Iraq, the party's prescription
for Iraq policy in 2001 would sound more credible.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Cheney has never ceased pretending that the only
choice Washington had in 1991 was to send US troops to Baghdad or
leave Saddam in power.  &UR; Today &LR;  his party's platform calls for
basing ``a comprehensive plan for the removal of Saddam Hussein''
on support for the Iraqi National Congress, ``an umbrella
organization reflecting a broad and representative group of Iraqis
who wish to free their country from the scourge of Saddam Hussein's
regime.''
</P>
<P>
   This plank of the Republican platform proposes a clear and
plausible means for rectifying the mistakes on Iraq made by
President Clinton and the Bush administration. It has the great
virtue of favoring a democratic future for Iraq after Saddam, and
it has the corollary advantage of helping Iraqis to overthrow the
criminal who has tortured and murdered so many of their
compatriots. This is preferable to accepting the counsel of some
Arab regimes that warn of Iraq's fragmentation into separate
entities should a Sunni Moslem minority no longer rule in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a service to the voters if George W. Bush and Cheney
were to debate Iraq policy in the fall campaign. Because of
Saddam's revived missile program and his chance to pursue nuclear,
chemical, and biological weapons again in the 20 months since UN
inspectors were kicked out of Iraq, the vengeful despot looms as a
true threat to his neighborhood and to the cause of
nonproliferation.
</P>
<P>
   But if Bush and Cheney wish to give a public airing to the
criticisms of Clinton or the policy proposals in the Republican
platform, they will first have to address the contradiction
implicit in that document. They will have to acknowledge that the
party's present critique of Clinton's Iraq policy applies equally
to some of the same Republican officials who now advise George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam has benefited too long from schizoid policy-making in
Washington. If Bush and Cheney want a substantive debate of the
crucial issue of Iraq, they will have to make it plain that they no
longer accept the premises of the original Republican containment
policy.

PREVIEW OF NO. 16 OHIO STATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
No. 16 Ohio State Conference: Big Ten Coach: John Cooper (103-39-4
in 12 seasons, 185-79-6 overall in 23 seasons) 1999: 6-6, 3-5 in
Big Ten, tied for 8th Bowl: None Starters returning: Six on
offense, seven on defense Key players: Senior WR Ken-Yon Rambo,
senior WR Reggie Germany, senior DE Rodney Bailey, junior QB Steve
Bellisari. Reasons to smile: Despite last year's .500 record, Ohio
State is loaded with talent. In a conference with many top
recievers, the Buckeyes might have two of the best in Germany and
Rambo. The defensive line is experienced and talented. Reasons to
frown: Bellisari is the team's quarterback, but he has to prove he
can win in the Big Ten. Last season, the Buckeyes never jelled as a
team. Finding that cohesiveness will be a challenge. A glorious
season if: Bellisari gets the job done at quarterback, a productive
tailback emerges and the defense plugs some holes. Datebook: The
Buckeyes get Big Ten challengers Penn State, Michigan State and
Michigan at home. However, Ohio State must play at Wisconsin on
Oct. 7 and at Illinois on Nov. 11. The nonconference schedule is
highlighted by a dangerous trip to Arizona on Sept. 9. This and
that: Ohio State is in the process of expanding Ohio Stadium.
Seating capacity is being increased from 89,000 to approximately
96,000. The $187 million project won't be completed until 2001, but
construction isn't expected to affect this season's home games. ...
Despite his 2-9-1 record against rival Michigan, Cooper signed a
five-year contract extension last year worth a guaranteed $1.1
million annually. ... Cooper reworked his coaching staff in the
off-season. He moved Chuck Stobart from receivers coach to
offensive coordinator and moved Jon Tenuta from defensive-backs
coach to defensive coordinator. ... Steve Bellisari's older
brother, Greg, a former Buckeyes' linebacker, is a
graduate-assistant defensive coach with the team.1999 statistical

SPOTLIGHT QB's improvement key for Buckeyes Ohio State coach John
Cooper says, ``Without a quarterback, you just don't have an
offense.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's Buckeyes offensive coordinator Chuck Stobart talking
about junior quarterback Steve Bellisari: ``Make no doubt _ he's
the man.''
</P>
<P>
   And in those two statements, you've got Ohio State's season in a
nutshell. Bellisari retains the quarterback job he won early last
season. But if he doesn't significantly improve, the Buckeyes could
be headed toward another 6-6 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like this season has taken forever to get here,''
Bellisari said. ``I've been wanting to erase some of the things
that happened last year. The only way to do that is by playing. I
feel we're going to be more competitive. After a season like that,
it's a motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bellisari beat out Austin Moherman for the starting spot in
September. However, the on-the-job training was difficult. It has
been 20 years since an Ohio State quarterback had worse statistics.
Bellisari ranked 10th in the Big Ten in passing efficiency,
completing 101 of 224 passes (45.1 percent) for 1,616 yards. He had
12 touchdown passes, nine interceptions and completed more than 50
percent of his passes only twice in 10 starts.
</P>
<P>
   However, in the middle of last season, Ohio State won three of
four games, including victories against bowl-bound Purdue and
Minnesota. In those games, Bellisari used quarterback draws and
scrambles to move the ball. Stobart plans to put more plays in this
season's offense to take advantage of Bellisari's mobility,
including some options.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid has been in our program for a couple of years,''
Cooper said. ``This year, he has a much better understanding of
what he can do, and, most importantly, we have a much better
understanding of what he can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Bellisari's previous claim to fame came as a freshman reserve
when he killed time playing on Ohio State special teams. At
6-foot-3 and 220 pounds, the athletic Bellisari is often compared
to Steve Young. So far, that comparison has mostly been made
because Bellisari and the former 49ers quarterback both throw
left-handed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always say losing builds character and stuff, but it was
tough,'' said Bellisari, who was intercepted twice in the Buckeyes'
season-ending 24-17 loss at Michigan. ``I look at it as a
motivating factor. I don't ever want to feel that way again. I was
more frustrated than anything. I'm a very competitive guy. I mean,
I don't like losing even a Play Station game.''

<P>
   MACHIDA CITY, Japan _ Sales started sliding at the Katos' small
sake shop here a decade ago, when trucks began coming into the
neighborhood and selling cut-price beer and other alcoholic
beverages off their tailgates.
</P>
<P>
   Now the trucks have been put out of business by convenience
stores, supermarkets and discount shops, but Yoshiro Kato and his
wife, Mitsuko, soldier on, determined to resist forces that could
turn shops like theirs into quaint memories of a Japan that no
longer exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's deregulation,'' she said. ``People in government say
Americans have deregulation, so we should too, but those saying
that don't understand the feelings of people like us who are just
struggling to survive. It's like they're telling us, just hurry up
and die, would you.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kato has suppressed her anger many times as once-loyal
customers walk past the shop in this Tokyo suburb, lugging heavy
bottles of alcohol from the supermarket nearby. She does not blame
them for the shop's waning business. Her own children, she said,
frequent discount stores, lured by ample parking space, late hours
and low prices.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 10 years have passed since Japan began to dismantle the
litany of licenses, permits and other regulatory approvals that
were long part of breaking into business here. Under deregulation,
competition has grown, the number of stores has increased and
Japanese consumers now enjoy many of the same benefits as Americans
in areas ranging from convenience banking to the purchase of
gasoline. But the endangered shotengai, or local shopping district,
has become a rallying point against deregulation among Japanese
worried that they are destroying something precious.
</P>
<P>
   In some isolated cases, the forces opposing deregulation are
prevailing. Neighborhood groups have banded together to fight
incursions by big store chains. And in a throwback to a more
regulated era, large retailers must now get permission from local
committees to open stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deregulation has been accepted without any criticism in Japan
as a great measure for reviving the economy,'' said Shoji Muranuki,
leader of a citizens' group that won concessions from a retail
chain seeking permission to open in their neighborhood. ``But how
can we say that deregulation is helping the economy when so many
local shopkeepers and merchants are hurting because of it?''
</P>
<P>
   Groups like Muranuki's and business associations that sat by
quietly as the effects of deregulation spread are now increasingly
vocal about drawing the line somewhere. Breaking up a telephone
monopoly like the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. is one
thing, they say, but destroying the livelihoods of local
shopkeepers is going too far. This sympathy for local shopkeepers
has given them a powerful means of defense that NTT does not have.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is like the difference between an elephant and
an ant,'' said Hiroshi Yamada, the mayor of Suginami ward in Tokyo,
when asked to compare the power of small shops to that of NTT, the
telecommunications giant that is under heavy political pressure to
accept further deregulation. ``NTT bows to the politicians, but the
politicians bow to the local shopkeepers.''
</P>
<P>
   Shopkeepers have traditionally been the backbone of the Japanese
neighborhood. They organize festivals that make the long, sticky
summers here tolerable. They are active in school affairs and
community sports. They hang out in front of their shops, chatting
with patrons and handing out candy or small toys to children.
</P>
<P>
   ``They might be feeble in terms of their sales power, but they
have a big say in what happens in local areas,'' Yamada said. They
lack the financial resources of big corporations like NTT, he said,
``but the local shop owners can collect something even more
valuable _ votes.''
</P>
<P>
   As a young member of Parliament a few years ago, Yamada was a
strong proponent of deregulation. But as a local politician, he has
pressed for passage of an ordinance to restrict activities of large
discount stores in the interest of protecting his constituents from
the traffic jams they fear will blight their neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that I have come to the front line, I have learned that
just legislating deregulation does not make deregulation
fruitful,'' he said. ``I realize that many conditions need to be
imposed to make deregulation work in society.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be, but the shotengai is one of the biggest drags on
Japan's sputtering economy. According to a new study by the
McKinsey Global Institute that blames Japan's economic troubles on
low productivity, traditional shops like the Katos' are far less
productive than their counterparts in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Many shops stay in business in part because of high tax
penalties that discourage them from selling their property.
Government loan guarantees and subsidies also make it easier to
survive.
</P>
<P>
   But the McKinsey study discloses another important source of the
traditional shopkeeper's power: Mom-and-pop shops account for 55
percent of retail employment here, while the entire retail industry
accounts for 12 percent of total employment and 5 percent of the
gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   Kabun Muto, a senior member of the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party, is making a name for himself as a champion of small
liquor-store owners like the Katos in particular and a critic of
deregulation in general. He has submitted a bill to postpone
further deregulation that could hurt neighborhood stores.
</P>
<P>
   Muto and the 220 representatives who support him also oppose the
relaxation of rules on taxi licensing. Muto contends that looser
rules have given the Japanese mafia a toehold in the cab business.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is less intervention by the bureaucracy now,'' said
Muto, whose family owns a sake brewery. ``But in creating such an
open environment, we have weakened society, and people would have
different opinions about whether that's a good thing or not.''

   DEMS-VEEP (Washington) _ Al Gore selects Connecticut Sen. Joseph

 MACHIDA CITY, Japan: or not.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The question for Japan is whether the social costs that concern
Muto _ the loss of livelihood by shopkeepers who are often pillars
of their communities or a potential increase in troubled youth _
offset the benefits of deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   In the fiscal year that ended in March 1998, the Economic
Planning Agency estimated that deregulation had created 8.6
trillion yen, or $83 billion at current exchange rates, in consumer
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also concluded that growth was notably strong that
year in deregulated businesses like telephone services, electricity
and gasoline, even as the overall economy shrunk. ``The progress in
the last few years has been marvelous,'' said Yoshihiko Miyauchi,
chairman of the government's Regulatory Reform Committee.
</P>
<P>
   He regards Muto's campaign and the lobbying of the All-Japan
Liquor Merchants' Association, whose officials paid 300 visits to
politicians last year and contributed 40 million yen, or about
$381,000, to the ruling party, as a sign of how far deregulation
has penetrated the economy. ``One reason we have these types of
movements is because the efforts we have made are having an
effect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Japan is falling behind the rest of the developed
world, Miyauchi said. ``We are walking in the right direction at a
very leisurely pace, congratulating ourselves for our progress,
while other countries are running this race like Olympic
athletes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those pressing for fast-paced regulatory change here seem more
like, well, Don Quixote, which happens to be the name of a discount
store chain that has become the bane of anti-deregulation forces.
The Don Quixote store in Suginami, where Yamada is mayor, has
become a cause celebre among proponents and opponents of reform,
with its extended hours, large parking lot and cut-rate prices.
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhood residents and local merchants united last year and
gathered 6,271 signatures in their campaign to keep the Don Quixote
store out. They worried that the store would attract motorcycle
gangs, increase traffic and worsen pollution. They feared that some
merchandise, ``adult'' toys and videos and knives, in particular,
would end up in the hands of youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, ``if the store operated 24 hours a day, regular shops
could not compete,'' said Muranuki, a retired salaryman who leads
the group. ``Already, our shops are suffering from large-sized
retailers like supermarkets.''
</P>
<P>
   The group won some concessions from Don Quixote. The store
agreed to close from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. daily, to avoid flashy
advertising and handouts that might lead to litter, and to keep
certain goods off its shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Suginami Assembly passed an ordinance in early
July that allows the mayor to block the opening of stores larger
than 500 square meters if he thinks the owner has failed to address
local concerns about ``the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The ordinance thus resurrected restrictions on retailers that
were recently abolished by the national government. ``Now, the
entire nation is focusing on what's happened here,'' Muranuki said
proudly.
</P>
<P>
   Takao Yasuda, the president of Don Quixote and a passionate
proponent of deregulation, contends that the citizens won a Pyrrhic
victory. His store did open, and its sales are running 30 percent
above expectations. ``We are closed in hours when few customers
would visit the store anyway, and if the store is closed, we can do
preparatory work, like straightening up the cash registers and
shelves,'' Yasuda said.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the group that opposed the store concede that their
worries have proved unfounded _ and take credit for it. They still
watch the store, patrolling the parking lot between 10 p.m. and 11
p.m. and making spot checks of the merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the shop isn't causing any trouble,'' said Kyoko
Hashiguchi, the group's secretary. ``Traffic jams outside the store
are much less than we expected because local people seem to ride
their bicycles to the store.''
</P>
<P>
   But Yasuda is concerned about the precedent the fight in
Suginami established. The citizens' appeal to quality-of-life
concerns has resonated with the media and with politicians in a way
that complaints solely about the economic impact of deregulation
have not.
</P>
<P>
   Their ability to enlist the local government in their cause is
also alarming, he said. The local ordinance's vague command that
retailers must ``protect the environment'' leaves plenty of room
for government interference, Yasuda said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ordinance itself is not so strong, but I worry that it is
rather arbitrary and fuzzy in its meaning,'' Yasuda said. ``That
means that in a uniquely Japanese way, the local government can
exercise its own power of interpretation, and that worries me.''

<P>
   It's hard to defend (beginitalic)Coyote Ugly (enditalic)as being
much of a movie. It's more like a collection of music videos, or a
pretty good LeAnn Rimes CD, or a fashion show for belly shirts,
leather pants and cowboy boots.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, that's all it's trying to be.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which could be retitled (beginitalic)Urban
Cowgirl(enditalic), delivers exactly what it promises - gorgeous
women in skimpy clothing, dancing in a rowdy bar. And it does so
with such an amiable tone, you can't help but like the silly thing.
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic)Coyote Ugly (enditalic)is all about titillation,
since its PG-13 rating won't allow anything more. The movie is
essentially one long parade of belly buttons.
</P>
<P>
   While men will enjoy it for obvious reasons, there's also plenty
here to attract women, including two strong female characters in
leading roles.
</P>
<P>
   Piper Perabo gives a winning performance as Violet, an aspiring
songwriter from the sticks who goes to work in a crazed New York
bar to make ends meet. The winsome Perabo seems to have emerged
unscathed from (beginitalic)The Adventures of Rocky and
Bullwinkle(enditalic), which is no mean feat.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Bello ((beginitalic)ER(enditalic)), does a nice job as
Lil, the tough bar owner who hires Violet to add some innocence to
the mix. Given a caricature to play, Bello pumps life into the
role.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all this chaos, there is John Goodman, doing a
heart-warming turn as Violet's widowed father, who doesn't want her
to leave for the big city. When the film threatens to slow down,
Goodman buoys it with one funny line after another. He also injects
a much-needed shot of credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the bar. Though supposedly patterned after a real
tavern, (beginitalic)Coyote Ugly (enditalic)seems like no other.
First off, the bartenders, or ``coyotes,'' all look like models
(one is played by real-life supermodel Tyra Banks). Between serving
drinks and setting the bar on fire, they turn up the music and
dance in their cowboy boots and halter tops, whipping the patrons
into a frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   This is the movie's trademark scene, and to make sure you don't
miss it, they show it about six times. After awhile, this becomes a
bit repetitious, as if the filmmakers couldn't think of much else
to do.
</P>
<P>
   To anyone who ever tended bar, the movie must seem pretty
ridiculous. But this is more about fantasy than reality.
</P>
<P>
   To fill the gaps between the dancing, producer Jerry Bruckheimer
added a paper-thin love story, featuring hunky Adam Garcia as
Kevin, Violet's would-be boyfriend. We know Kevin is a nice guy,
because he collects comic books. There's a cute little back-story
that has Kevin trying to persuade Violet to overcome her stage
fright and perform her songs on stage.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Perabo gets a little more help than that. In the
movie, her singing is dubbed by country-Western star Rimes, which
is a little like subbing Michael Jordan into a pickup game at the
Y.
</P>
<P>
   Still, (beginitalic)Coyote Ugly (enditalic)has a pretty good
beat, and you can dance to it.

&HT;     LIEBERMAN JOINS AN EXCLUSIVE CLUB 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the Democrats nominate Joseph Lieberman for
vice president next week, they will inscribe the Connecticut
senator's name beside those of others who have ripped down barriers
that prevented individuals from attaining or seeking high office
because of religion, race, gender or geographic base.
</P>
<P>
   The club to which Lieberman _ an Orthodox Jew _ will be admitted
is very small and exclusive. Its members have weathered storms over
their religious affiliations, the color of their skin, their sex or
their area of origin. The club has included:
</P>
<P>
   _ New York Gov. Alfred E. Smith, who in 1928 became the first
Catholic to be nominated by a major party for president. His quest
failed.
</P>
<P>
   _ John F. Kennedy, the first Catholic to be elected president.
</P>
<P>
   _ New York Rep. Geraldine Ferraro, nominated for vice president
by the Democrats in 1984, the first woman in either major party to
be so honored.
</P>
<P>
   _ Housing and Urban Development Secretary Robert Weaver, the
first black Cabinet officer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Labor Secretary Frances Perkins, the first woman to serve in
the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Like Lieberman, all were Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   To that list, we could add the name of Thurgood Marshall, the
first black named to the Supreme Court and that of Sandra Day
O'Connor, the first woman appointed to the high court. Marshall was
a Democrat; O'Connor is a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   And certainly Eleanor Roosevelt was a member of that elite group
as the first lady who cast aside the strictures that had bound her
predecessors and established own career as an outspoken proponent
of racial equality, federal aid for the poor and the peace-keeping
efforts of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Should Hillary Rodham Clinton win the Senate seat she is seeking
in New York, she would achieve a remarkable first. No other first
lady has sought public office.
</P>
<P>
   A further addition to the group is Jimmy Carter of Georgia, who
in 1976 became the first individual from the Deep South to be
elected president since before the Civil War, which ended in 1865.
</P>
<P>
   In l916, Woodrow Wilson ignited a religious conflagration when
he nominated Louis D. Brandeis as the first Jewish member of the
Supreme Court. Brandeis' ability was never in question, but his
religion and his liberal reputation were.
</P>
<P>
   He eventually became one of the court's great justices.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the walls that bar admittance of able Americans to the
upper reaches of government have tumbled down in recent years. But
each success has been the product of a struggle that pitted
American against American.
</P>
<P>
   The problems faced by those who are confronted by bigotry was
addressed memorably by Kennedy in his successful 1960 campaign for
president. Appearing before the Houston Ministerial Association,
Kennedy declared: ``I believe in an America where the separation of
church and state is absolute _ where no Catholic prelate would tell
the president (should he be a Catholic) how to act, and no
Protestant minister would tell his parishioners for whom to vote _
where no church or church school is granted any public funds or
political preference ... an America that is officially neither
Catholic, Protestant nor Jewish _ where no public official either
requests or accepts instructions on public policy from ... any ...
ecclesiastical source ... where there is no Catholic vote, no
anti-Catholic vote, no bloc voting of any kind and where religious
liberty is so indivisible that an act against one church is treated
as an act against all.''
</P>
<P>
   To that powerful defense of the separation of church and state,
Kennedy added: ``I am not the Catholic candidate for president. I
am the Democratic Party's candidate for president, who happens also
to be a Catholic. I do not speak for my church on public matters,
and the church does not speak for me.''
</P>
<P>
   What criticism Lieberman may face in the upcoming presidential
campaign is anybody's guess. But he should be able to weather
anything that is thrown at him, by remembering the ordeal faced by
other members of the exclusive club.

<P>
   LISBON, Portugal _ At the urging of eminent Portuguese
paleontologists, the government is acting to protect the country's
rich array of dinosaur fossils and tracks, threatened now by the
forces of erosion and development.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the fossils turned up along the Atlantic coast of
Portugal. Among recent finds were a dinosaur nest with scores of
eggs, several containing embryos; a skull with well-preserved neck
vertebrae of a theropod, a carnivorous bipedal dinosaur; and the
world's longest track way left by sauropods, giant plant eaters
that walked on all fours. But dinosaur fossils and tracks have long
been noticed there, though people did not always realize what they
were.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent paleontologists like Martin Lockley of the University
of Colorado, Philippe Taquet of the Museum of Natural History in
Paris, Jose Bonaparte of the Argentine Museum of Natural Sciences
have recognized the exceptional value of these fossils and have
worked with Portuguese scientists on a number of scientific papers
in connection with these discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Portugal is a showcase for dinosaur resources now that we know
they have good bones, tracks, eggs and embryos,'' Lockley said in
an interview during the International Dinosaur Conference in Lisbon
in 1998. He pointed out that tracks and the vertebrate record ``are
very sparse globally'' from the Middle Jurassic _ 175 million years
ago _ and, until recently, there were surprisingly few reports of
well-preserved track ways from the Late Jurassic or 145 million
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up to present, there exists a legal void concerning our
paleontological resources,'' Professor Miguel Telles Antunes of the
Nova University at Lisbon, who heads the scientific group, said in
an interview last month. For example, he said, people who unearth a
dinosaur egg or even a complete skeleton in Portugal are not
obliged to inform the authorities and may dispose of them any way
they wish.
</P>
<P>
   To remedy the situation, Jose Mariano Gago, minister of science
and technology, said in an interview that the government planned to
set up a National Council for Paleontology under his ministry by
October. The government is also studying proposals for the
establishment of museums to protect the most important track sites.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, paleontology, including studies on the protection of
paleontological resources, has been established as a new separate
research field with financing from the National Science Foundation.
Portuguese scientists have complained that despite the national
wealth in fossils, paleontology and paleobiology of dinosaur
studies were limited to a couple of hours in connection with a
master's degree in biology.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Portuguese have been aware of large fossil
footprints on certain cliffs since the Middle Ages but had given
them a religious significance. For example, according to a 13th
century legend, footprints up the steep cliff at Cape Espichel,
south of Lisbon, were made by a giant mule that rescued the Virgin
from Lagosteiros Bay and carried her up the steep cliff to safety.
A popular shrine to Our Lady of the Mule was built at the cape.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, Antunes identified the footprints as those of a giant
theropod of the Late Jurassic Portlandian age. In fact, he said,
the Lagosteiros cliffs are one of the richest sites in Europe for
dinosaur tracks from the Lower Cretaceous, about 70 million years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there has been a surge of fossil discoveries from the
Late Jurassic, 145 million years ago, in what is known as the
Lusitanian Basin.
</P>
<P>
   Lourinha, an ancient farm town near the coast, is the site of
the most impressive fossil discoveries and its small museum,
established in 1980, contains the most varied and best-preserved
paleontological collection in the country. Lourinha is also the
home of the Ethnological and Archeological Group of Lourinha, known
by its Portuguese acronym as GEAL (pronounced JAY-al). Like the
museum, GEAL was formed by the Mateus family (no relation to the
wine producers).
</P>
<P>
   It was Isabel Mateus, an amateur speleologist, who made a major
discovery in 1993 on a seaside cliff at Paimogo, north of Lourinha,
when she chanced upon a large cluster of eggs while walking with
her 3-year-old daughter, Marta.
</P>
<P>
   She immediately recognized the black oval eggs as belonging to
dinosaurs, even though they were largely broken into fragments.
</P>
<P>
   Mateus, her husband, Horacio, a retired government tax employee,
their son Octavio, a biology student, and a number of villagers
painstakingly excavated and cleaned six large blocks containing
more than 100 eggs. In the process, over three summers, they found
some eggs with embryos and many tiny bones, adult theropod teeth
and fragments of three crocodile-like eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Later with help from Antunes and Taquet, the Mateuses identified
the Paimogo eggs as theropod remains, dating from the Upper
Jurassic and resembling those found in the Upper Jurassic of
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Paimogo discovery, we have the extremely rare
opportunity to correlate a shell morphotype with taxonomically
identified dinosaur bones,'' Taquet said at Lisbon's First
International Meeting on Dinosaur Paleobiology in 1998. He called
the clutches ``exceptional'' because dinosaur eggs in Jurassic beds
are very rare, generally come in smaller clutches of 12 to 24 eggs
and rarely contain embryos.
</P>
<P>
   Now studying for a doctorate in paleontology, with a fellowship
from Nova, Octavio Mateus, 25, is trying to determine if there is a
relationship between the eggs and the incomplete skeleton of a
theropod found earlier by a local farmer. An exuberant
fossil-hunter, Octavio also supervises dozens of volunteers in
summer fieldwork and handles foreign relations for GEAL.
</P>
<P>
   His sister Marta, now 11, is a born fossil-hunter and came upon
a well-preserved theropod skull in hard sandstone near Lourinha in
1997, which is still under study.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Horacio Mateus, 50, runs the museum and is organizing
a nationwide campaign to promote it. ``We dream of creating a great
museum of natural history in Lourinha,'' Mateus said in an
interview. He said the existing museum was filled with specimens
from the region.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Before Paimogo appeared on the world's paleontological map,
Portugal had attracted international attention with the discovery
of several important dinosaur track sites. The most spectacular
tracks _ and the only site organized for visits _ are those in
Serra d'Aire Park, near the Roman Catholic sanctuary of Fatima. A
score of long track ways with some 1,000 giant elliptical
footprints can be seen clearly on the floor of a limestone quarry,
as if a herd of dinsaurs had passed through only yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Classified as a natural monument in 1996, the Fatima site
includes the longest known sauropod track way in the world,
measuring 147 meters. The track makers have been identified as
brontosaurs, which go back 175 million years. At that age,
according to Lockley, they are ``the oldest known wide-gauge
sauropod footprints.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanda dos Santos, 32, a Portuguese geologist who has worked with
Lockley, told the paleobiology conference that there were at least
20 Jurassic sites with sauropod track ways in Portugal, or
one-third of the world's total known Jurassic sites.
</P>
<P>
   Cretaceous track sites are less significant in Portugal, she
said, except for the Carenque track way, which is one of the
longest in Europe at 141 meters.
</P>
<P>
   What is known as the Battle of Carenque took place in 1992,
after it was found that dinosaur tracks lay in the path of a
highway construction project in a Lisbon suburb. Two tunnels were
built for the highway under the tracks, at great cost.
</P>
<P>
   The tracks are covered with latex until a museum is built over
them.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 International Dinosaur Conference designated Portugal
as a productive field for paleontological studies. John R. Horner,
a conference participant from Montana who found the first eggs with
embryos in the United States in the late 1970s, emphasized the
importance of the Paimogo eggs, which he said were the first
dinosaur eggs with embryos found in Europe and provided valuable
material for research.
</P>
<P>
   A conference organizer, Galopim de Carvalho, who heads the
Natural History Museum, paid tribute to the foreign specialists
``who have come here to do what we cannot do for lack of means.''
He urgently appealed to the authorities to develop paleontological
studies and provide museums for the most important track sites,
like the Fatima site, which could be lost if not protected.
</P>
<P>
   While the Portuguese are working out ways to protect their
paleontological treasures, help could come from the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, or Unesco.
Science and Technology Minister Gago announced that ``general
agreement'' had been reached with Unesco to name a Portuguese site
as a Geoparque, a classification created last year for the
protection of natural resources.

   LOS ANGELES _ Question: I am being considered for a promotion,
and I feel flattered about this. The problem, and I don't like to
admit it, is that I am nervous about my ability to handle the
position. Do you have any suggestions for a person in my situation?
M.N.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: If you were being considered for a promotion and were
not nervous, that would be enough to get management nervous. Your
nervousness is totally normal. The possibility of this promotion is
a major life change filled with unknowns, and that is the classic
formula for nervousness, and even some anxiety, self-doubt and
resistance.
</P>
<P>
   It is very important to avoid letting your nervousness interfere
with this opportunity or with your chances for success if you are
promoted. Now is the time to keep your expectations as positive as
possible. If you enter a new position and expect to fail, you
greatly increase your chances of doing so.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to enter a new position with the firm belief that
you are smart, successful and will do whatever is necessary to
perform with excellence. When an athlete feels a little nervous
before a race, that can actually energize him or her to perform at
even higher levels. Why shouldn't that happen to you too?
</P>
<P>
   When you are first promoted, you will probably receive at least
some guidance and mentoring. If you feel that you need to know
more, you can do some reading or take some courses. Remember, no
one involved in your promotion wants you to fail, for that would be
a failure for them too.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We have an excellent technical employee who wants to take a
month off without pay so that he can teach a course. We are
dismayed that he would be out this long, but if we don't let him do
this, we are afraid that he will leave. Is there any way to change
his mind? F.V.
</P>
<P>
   A: If you try to change this employee's mind, he may end up
changing employers. You know what the job market is like for
technical people, and unless you enjoy hunting, you are going to
need to show some flexibility. The fact is that it is better to
have him for a somewhat reduced period than not have him at all.
</P>
<P>
   Over the near term, his teaching responsibilities will further
encourage him to keep his expertise current, and this is a true
benefit to your company. And, over the longer term, if he truly
enjoys teaching others, he is actually demonstrating some
motivations that are highly appropriate for a managerial position,
and that is worth keeping in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Another benefit to your company is that employees who have the
freedom to pursue this type of professional activity often have
increased appreciation for their regular employer. And, when these
employees return to work, they typically come back filled with
renewed energy and enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   If you look at the big picture, having an employee who takes
time off to do some teaching is actually a great learning
experience for all involved.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whenever I meet with my manager, he takes out his nail
clippers and cuts his fingernails throughout our discussion. I
think this is rude, inconsiderate and sort of gross, but I don't
want to say anything because he could get real upset. What can I
do? M.A.
</P>
<P>
   A: If anyone has a right to be upset in this cutting episode,
it's you. If you want your manager to clip his nails on his own
time and not on yours, you are going to have to say something.
</P>
<P>
   The next time you are meeting with him and the clippers come
out, don't even let the cutting begin. Tell him that you would
greatly appreciate it if he would not cut his nails while the two
of you are talking. After you say this, be quiet. There is no need
to discuss why you feel this way, how much it disgusts you, or
anything else.
</P>
<P>
   The next move is his. He may surprise you and put the clippers
away. In fact, this outcome is not as unlikely as you might expect.
With your message delivered in a calm, direct and businesslike
style, he might actually get it.
</P>
<P>
   On a worst case basis, he will look at you and then proceed to
clip away. This means that he is sending you a message well beyond
the clipping. That message is that he is not interested in your
thoughts, feelings or needs. He is only interested in himself and
his nails.
</P>
<P>
   A word or two with his boss is in order here. If your manager,
however, continues his clipping service, then you have some
nail-biting decisions to make. &QL;

`SAMMY': AN ARCHIE   FOR 2000   WITH A TASTE   FOR LECHERY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Broadcast notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
 By NEIL GENZLINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's too bad, really, that ``Sammy,'' David Spade's new animated
sitcom, didn't make its appearance about 30 years ago. That was the
moment in history when loutishness could be lovable, as Norman Lear
showed us with Archie Bunker. Alas, Spade's Sammy, who makes his
debut Tuesday night on NBC, is a lout born too late.
</P>
<P>
   When Archie and ``All in the Family'' landed in living rooms in
January 1971, the notion of what is today called politically
incorrect behavior was still a hazy one; part of the show's
scandalousness was that it was educating and defining as it went
along. ``See?'' the subtext of each episode read. ``This is what
bigotry and insensitivity are, and now let's all share a laugh over
someone who's a step behind.''
</P>
<P>
   The title character in ``Sammy,'' who is billed as being based
on Spade's own father, is a sort of hypersexed Archie, spewing
bawdy bedroom talk the way Lear's character served up invective
about blacks and Poles. Sammy, who abandoned his wife and three
young sons at some point in the distant past, has reappeared in
order to mooch off one of those sons, James, who has become a
television star. Part of the fun of the show is that Spade provides
the voices of both father and son.
</P>
<P>
   The notion, apparently, is that Sammy and James form a bond in
adulthood that they never had as father-son; Sammy's eccentricity
is supposed to be endearing as well as offensive. Today, though,
that's too much to ask. There are certainly still plenty of lechers
among us, some even as openly lascivious as Sammy, but we're beyond
the point where thinking people will put up with them. It's the
back half of the ``Arthur'' syndrome at work: Dudley Moore's drunk
was amusing and poignant in the original 1981 film but an
embarrassment in ``Arthur II'' in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   This makes ``Sammy'' not quite work, even though many of its
component parts are quite good. There is subtle wit and social
commentary sprinkled throughout the show, as when James, accepting
a drink from his immigrant maid at poolside, asks her:
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you ever had one of those days where things work out
better than you could have possibly imagined, and you realize
everything you were worried about just disappeared, and the sun is
shining and the birds are singing and you just feel completely at
peace with the world?''
</P>
<P>
   The maid answers, ``Almost every day is like that for me.'' Then
she adds deferentially, ``I'll go clean the toilets now.''
</P>
<P>
   Also welcome is the way the animated format, unencumbered by the
pacing requirements of a laugh track and/or live audience, allows
such lines to be delivered the way they would be in real life: as
fleeting asides, or muttered, or thought rather than spoken. Thus
Sammy, after making a throat-scarring bear growl during a barroom
brawl with another son, Gary (Bob Odenkirk), can pause just long
enough to say under his breath, ``Note to self: Don't make bear
noise; it hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   The voice work in ``Sammy'' is notable. Maura Tierney as James'
gorgeous assistant, Andy Dick as his agent, Harland Williams as the
third brother and others catch their characters nicely.
</P>
<P>
   Especially impressive is Spade's rich and nuanced rendition of
Sammy, who is braying vulgarly one minute and whimpering pitifully
the next. With the animation nothing special and the plot lines
fairly standard sitcom stuff, the best way to take in ``Sammy''
might be with eyes closed, just focusing on the vocal techniques.
Maybe then it would be possible to drift back to those salacious,
sexist days of yore.

 &HT;    AMD completes spinoff of communications products division
 &HT;    By Kirk Ladendorf
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas - Employees of Austin's newest chip maker headed
to a minor league baseball game Monday night to celebrate, but
their infant company, Legerity Inc., already has a solid batting
average.
</P>
<P>
   The spinoff from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. has a solid
customer base, $300 million in annual sales, a veteran staff of 250
and a portfolio of several hundred patents.
</P>
<P>
   Now all it must do is recruit a new chief executive, fill about
60 job openings, find a new headquarters site and beef up its
product portfolio. All those moves are part of a plan for a public
stock offering within 18 months, company executives said. To
accomplish all that, the new company will have to live up to its
name, which means quick and agile.
</P>
<P>
   A California investment group, Francisco Partners, completed its
purchase Monday of AMD's former communications products division
for $375 million, allowing the formation.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Partners agreed to buy the AMD division in May after
the chip maker said it would sell the communications division to
concentrate on its other product lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at ourselves as a $300 million startup,'' said company
chief operating officer Gary Ashcraft, a 25-year veteran of AMD.
``We have real customers and real products and real profits that
can fuel our growth.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has made chips used in voice communications
equipment for many years, but it has plans to move into more
advanced chips used in high-speed Internet access gear.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Legerity has a solid base of business and
technical expertise to build a solid company in a fast-moving
telecommunications market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good little division,'' said analyst Fred Zieber with
Pathfinder Research of San Jose, Calif. ``It was an orphan within
AMD,'' he said, which has been preoccupied in recent years with its
rivalry with Intel Corp. to gain a foothold in the microprocessor
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year from now they could be the hottest company in the
world,'' Zieber said. ``It's amazing what getting rid of the parent
company can do for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Legerity is an independent company, but it still has ties to its
former parent. AMD has agreed to manufacture, test, package and
ship many of the new company's chips for the next five years. AMD
retains a 10 percent ownership interest in the company.
</P>
<P>
   Legerity also is leasing 35,000 square feet of space from AMD at
a former Lockheed site in Southeast Austin. The company expects to
find a new headquarters by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The company has 60 job openings that it is trying to fill in
engineering, marketing and finance.
</P>
<P>
   The company already has filled several senior level positions
from the ranks of AMD managers. Russ Apfel is chief technology
officer; Homer Lloyd is vice president of marketing; Michael
Stibilia is director of systems architecture; Michael Hogan is
director of CMOS product development; and Duncan Ashworth if vice
president of bipolar products and process technology.

LIEBERMAN'S CONSERVATIVE RECORD IS NO HELP TO GORE, GOP SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
 (With GORE-LIEBERMAN) 
 By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans praised the selection of Sen. Joseph I.
Lieberman as Vice President Al Gore's running mate Monday but
contended that Lieberman had major differences with Gore and that
his conservative record would not help the ticket with core
Democratic voters.
</P>
<P>
   But spokesmen for labor, teachers and environmental and abortion
rights groups enthusiastically spoke out for the Democratic ticket
and brushed off Lieberman's occasional votes against their
positions.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, Texas, Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Gov. George W.
Bush, called the Connecticut senator ``a good man who Governor Bush
and Secretary Cheney respect.'' He added, ``From Social Security
reform to missile defense, tort reform to parental notification,
from school choice to affirmative action, Al Gore has chosen a man
whose positions are more similar to Governor Bush's positions than
to his own.''
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Mahe, a veteran Republican consultant, said the choice
probably has ``a small political downside'' for Gore because it
``further erodes his support on the left.''
</P>
<P>
   Clifford May, chief spokesman for the Republican National
Committee, called the choice ``a stick in the eye to the Democratic
labor base, the teachers union bosses.'' He said the selection
``does nothing to solidify his base, and he needs to.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 70 percent of Democrats support Gore, according to a new
CBS News Poll, while 88 percent fo Republicans back Bush. May and
Ed Gillespie, a Republican consultant, both said they looked
forward to the first ``Gore-Lieberman debate.''
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota
disagreed. He said, ``I think it will excite the base because it is
a clear indication that Al Gore is determined to win this
election.''
</P>
<P>
   And spokesmen for core Democratic constituencies backed him up.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Feldman, president of the American Federation of
Teachers, called Lieberman a man of ``great integrity, a thinking
man'' and ``a very strong supporter of labor and of education.''
She minimized his votes for school vouchers, saying, ``He voted
just a couple of times for an experiment.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Rosenthal, political director of the AFL-CIO, said despite
differences over trade issues and school vouchers, Lieberman ``has
had a very strong voting record on behalf of working families.'' He
said the choice ``helps make this an election about things that
matter to workers: Social Security, health care, education,''
instead of ``muddying the water with a lot of talk about
morality.''
</P>
<P>
   Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion and
Reproductive Rights Action League, another major force in the
Democratic coalition, was equally enthusiastic. She called it ``a
bold and excellent choice.'' She said ``It's also a statement about
Gore's commitment to pro-choice values and a woman's right to
choose.''
</P>
<P>
   May's office released a letter it said Lieberman had written in
1989 that included this statement: ``I also support a requirement
that parents of a minor be notified before an abortion is
performed.'' But Michelman dismissed releasing the letter as a
``desperate tactic,'' saying that whatever Lieberman may have
thought then, what mattered was that on two subsequent occasions he
voted in the Senate against parental notification measures
involving abortion.
</P>
<P>
   There was no shortage of applause from Democrats. Al From,
president of the moderate Democratic Leadership Council, called
Lieberman ``a terrific choice for America, the Democratic Party and
the New Democrat Movement.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Senate's leading liberal, Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,
said, ``Joe Lieberman is a giant in the Senate. He's worked
brilliantly, effectively and tirelessly to promote the highest
values of public service and integrity in public office.'' Kennedy
cited Lieberman's efforts on issues including the minimum wage, the
environment, education and defense.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, the other Democrat from Connecticut,
called Lieberman's selection ``a reach to the future.'' He recalled
attending the 1960 convention with his parents in Los Angeles,
where Democrats nominated John F. Kennedy, and hearing people
complain, ``You can't elect a Catholic president.'' He said, ``I
think there is some symmetry that 40 years later in that same city
we are going to nominate an Orthodox Jew.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally, Republicans would not discuss what made the choice
historic: Lieberman's religion. ``I think it's irrelevant,'' May
said.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League,
said that while ``approximately 12 percent of the American people
have strong anti-Semitic views, these people don't vote anyway.''
He said that with at least 70 percent of Jews already voting
Democratic, there was little room for the party to gain simply by
having Lieberman on the ticket. He called the selection ``a wise
choice, a dramatic choice. It says a lot about America. From our
perspective I think it's a milestone.'' .
</P>
<P>
   While the Bush campaign gave the impression that the selection
did not trouble them, Bill Kristol, a Republican strategist and
publisher of The Weekly Standard, said the choice destroyed the
argument that the Democrats were seeking ``a third term for
Clinton-Gore.'' He said Lieberman's selection made the ``character
issue considerably less relevant.''
</P>
<P>
   The news ``stopped the Bush story in its tracks,'' Kristol said.
``It ended the `bounce' today.''

REPORT CITES BENEFITS OF RACIALLY-MIXED CLASSROOMS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Students who attend racially-mixed schools say they are more
willing to live and work in a multi-racial society, according to a
Harvard University study that aims to measure the benefits of
classroom diversity _ and blunt challenges to school desegregation
plans across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Civil Rights Project, a Harvard think tank, says the survey
of high school juniors in the racially-balanced schools of
Louisville, Ky., provides ``strong evidence'' to support districts
that assign students to schools based in part on their race. The
survey was released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Louisville students' opinions on race are very different
and very much more optimistic than what you see in other surveys
about race,'' said Gary Orfield, who heads the Civil Rights
Project.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, an overwhelming majority of the 1,164
students surveyed said that exposure to people of a different race
had given them a greater understanding of that group's views, and
80 percent said their school experience had helped them get along
better with members of other races.
</P>
<P>
   Also, about 90 percent of the students who responded said they
were comfortable or very comfortable discussing controversial
issues related to race _ a far higher percentage than in surveys of
the general population, Orfield said.
</P>
<P>
   All of the students surveyed attended high schools with a black
student population of between 20 and 50 percent. The survey's
response rate was more than 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have grown up in an intensely desegregated setting and
they feel very comfortable in it and plan to live and work in it as
adults,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Orfield added that the survey, which will be followed by similar
studies in other districts around the country, tackles the question
posed by a federal appeals court in 1998 when it struck down the
race-based admissions policy of the prestigious Boston Latin
School: exactly how does such a policy advance educational goals?
</P>
<P>
   But attorney Michael McLaughlin, who represented a white Boston
student in challenging the Latin School's race-based admission
policy after she was rejected in favor of 10 minority students with
lower test scores, dismissed the study as ``advocacy research'' and
``pseudo-science.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin noted that the Harvard survey lacks a reliable
control group and fails to account for factors other than classroom
diversity that might have influenced the students' attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all want to believe what they're going for,'' McLaughlin
said. ``But as a matter of science and law, you will never get
there because it is too easily disproven. We're trying to prove
amorphous concepts.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin insists he supports affirmative action to correct
clear cases of past discrimination. But he noted that the Boston
School Department and other districts use racial diversity as their
goal, yet never define the term.
</P>
<P>
   To do so, he argued, the schools would have to cite specific
percentages of minority students, thus leaving them open to charges
of using quotas, which are unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is essentially trying to get a result that cannot be
scientifically evaluated. It's just wishful thinking.''

VARYING TREATMENT FOR NEWBORNS COSTING LIVES, STUDY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many states are failing to adopt new technologies for testing
blood samples of newborns, allowing children to die needlessly from
undetected rare but devastating diseases, according to a national
task force report released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The task force, sponsored by the Health Services and Resources
Administration and the American Academy of Pediatrics, said broad
disease screening of infants belongs on a national agenda even
though states traditionally determine on their own what diseases to
test for. Currently, a baby may become retarded or die from an
undetected disease in one state while another infant across the
state line gets timely treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But officials at the March of Dimes immediately criticized the
report for not going further and identifying a ``menu'' of tests
all states should mandate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system is extremely fragmented and in terrible disarray,
so that newborns in the United States aren't well served,'' said
Dr. Donald R. Mattison, medical director of the March of Dimes, in
an interview.
</P>
<P>
   It is urgent, he said, that a nationwide testing program be
standardized ``so that every single baby that's born with a disease
for which there is treatment has an opportunity to have that
disease detected or treatment.'' About 4 million babies are born
each year in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The report was of necessity ``a compromise'' among members who
varied in their enthusiasm for expanded screening, Dr. Harvey Levy
of Children's Hospital in Boston, a member of the task force,
sponsored by the Health Services and Resources Administration and
the American Academy of Pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
   He echoed the report's call for a ``national consensus'' on
disease tests, but noted that many state health officials ``are
very jealous about their prerogatives in newborn screening,'' and
don't want outside interference.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Edward McCabe, cochair of the task force, said that he
welcomed the March of Dimes' criticism, but defended the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the first time it's been stated that there should be a
national agenda'' on an issue that has traditionally been
controlled by stastes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 rare metabolic diseases can now be detected through
high-tech analysis of a blood sample taken at birth. In many cases,
they cause severe retardation or developmental disorders or death,
but if treated promptly with special diets or medication, the
infants can lead fairly normal lives.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts is a pioneer in newborn screening, and over the
last two years has expanded its list of required tests to about 30.
The additional tests can be carried out because of a relatively new
technology called Tandem Mass Spectrometry, or TMS. Some states
only test for three or four or five diseases, and may not employ
the most reliable test methods, said the task force report, which
appears in a special supplement to the August issue of the journal
Pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
   A Maine couple, Alex and Susan Millett, said Monday they are
petitioning the state to require testing for a rare disease that
wasn't immediately diagnosed in their daughter, Gabrielle, who is
now 6 months old.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Susan Millett said, blood from Maine newborns is
sent for testing to Massachusetts, where the test in question _ for
a disease called proprionic acidemia _ is part of the mandatory
set. But because Maine doesn't require it, no one notified the
Milletts that Gabrielle was affected.
</P>
<P>
   When the newborn was lethargic, not eating well and vomiting, no
doctor suspected the disease until two weeks later when Gabrielle
was hospitalized with seizures and became comatose. Medication and
a special low-protein diet would have prevented much of the brain
damage she suffered, said Susan Millett Monday. And if her newborn
heelstick blood sample had been tested for the disease, ``we
wouldn't have gone two weeks just thinking she was sleepy,''
Millett said.
</P>
<P>
   The March of Dimes, a voluntary health agency dedicated to
preventing birth defects, recommends a core group of eight
screening tests for all newborns. They are for PKU
(phenylketonuria), congenital hypothyroidism, congenital adrenal
hyperplasia, biotinidase deficiency, maple syrup urine disease,
galactosemia, homocystinuria and sickle cell anemia.
</P>
<P>
   Of these, sickle cell anemia is the most common, affecting 1
baby in 400, and the rarest is homocystinuria, affecting 1 in
275,000.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They call themselves the world's oldest political
party, and the Democrats bear the burden of their own history.
</P>
<P>
   The very first Democratic platform in 1840 supported slavery and
forbade the federal government to undertake any ``general system of
internal improvements'' for the American people.
</P>
<P>
   The evolution of the party's philosophy since then is chronicled
in a century and a half of subsequent platforms, which stand as
barometers of changing public opinion and emerging trends across
most of the nation's political history.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Democrats became champions of civil rights and
advocates of federal action on every front, as well as federal
spending to improve education, nutrition, housing, employment,
health and transportation; fight poverty; raise living standards;
and create the Social Security system to ease retirement.
</P>
<P>
   The record also shows the Democrats hopping from one side to the
other on a wide variety of issues right up to the present.
</P>
<P>
   Party platforms have called for higher taxes and lower taxes,
less defense spending and more defense spending, denying entry to
immigrants and welcoming immigrants, isolating China and bringing
China into the world community, states' rights and civil rights. At
different times, the Democrats have been for and against the use of
military force, for balanced budgets and for deficit spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no sentient entity called the Democratic Party, no
disciplined, coherent party structure,'' said Rep. Barney Frank,
D-Mass. ``It's a lot of competing, conflicting people.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, in the last 100 years particularly, the Democrats
have managed to forge a distinct identity around certain repeated
principles that contradict those the party proclaimed in its
earliest days.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Democratic Party that first called in the platform of
1908 for an income tax on individuals and corporations. In the same
platform and successive ones, the Democrats firmly allied
themselves with organized labor, endorsed the eight-hour workday,
proposed creation of the Labor Department, asserted that ``there
should be no abridgment of the right of wage earners to organize
for the protection of wages and the improvement of labor
conditions,'' and rejected claims that labor unions should be
regarded ``as illegal combinations in restraint of trade.''
Establishment of a minimum wage and then periodic demands to
increase it became staples of Democratic platforms, along with the
principle of overtime pay.
</P>
<P>
   Health care has been another perennial platform issue for the
Democrats. The party proposed a national bureau of public health in
1908 and federal tuberculosis sanitariums for the needy in 1916,
and promised in the platform of 1928 to ``appropriate all monies
necessary'' for federal research to find cures for cancer, polio
and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The 1948 platform proposed a federal program of disability and
sickness benefits and 13 weeks of maternity benefits for working
mothers.
</P>
<P>
   By 1952, the Democrats sounded alarms over the rising cost of
medical care and promised to pour federal money into research,
medical training, hospital construction, preventive medicine and
rural health services.
</P>
<P>
   The 1960 platform called for a federal program to provide health
care to all retired persons without a means test. ``This has first
The addition of prescription drug benefits to Medicare was in the
party's 1972 platform, which also called for a program of universal
national health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Early Democratic platforms generally toed a line in support of
states' rights -- essentially a euphemism for discrimination and
segregation. But in 1948, divided Democrats departed from that
tradition and, led by Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota, adopted
strong new civil rights language committing the party to efforts to
``eradicate all racial, religious and economic discrimination,''
and declaring that ``minorities must have the right to live, the
right to work, the right to vote, and the full and equal protection
of the laws on a basis of equality with all citizens as guaranteed
by the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Southern delegates refused to support the Democratic
presidential nominee, Harry S. Truman, because of his civil rights
program, and a Southern faction known as Dixiecrats broke away to
nominate Gov. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina instead.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Irony abounds in the policy gyrations of Democrats seeking to
synchronize themselves with the swinging pendulum of politics.
</P>
<P>
   The 1960 Democrats who nominated John F. Kennedy for president
adopted a platform vow to beef up the Internal Revenue Service and
crack down on tax cheats. ``We will add enforcement personnel and
develop new techniques of enforcement to collect revenue which is
now being lost through evasion,'' the party thundered.
</P>
<P>
   By 1976, Democrats were banging out a different tune. ``We will
protect the rights of all taxpayers against oppressive procedures,
harassment and invasions of privacy by the Internal Revenue
Service,'' the platform said.
</P>
<P>
   The current opposition of President Clinton and congressional
Democrats to Republican bills repealing the estate tax, the
marriage penalty and taxation of Social Security benefits seems at
odds with some of the party's earlier platform pledges.
</P>
<P>
   A 1980 plank declared that the Democratic Party would ``oppose
any effort to tamper with the Social Security system by cutting or
taxing benefits as a violation of the contract the American
government made with its people.'' The Democratic Congress passed a
bill taxing Social Security benefits in 1993 and Clinton signed the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   The 1980 platform pledged to ``end tax discrimination that
penalizes married working couples'' -- Clinton vetoed a
GOP-sponsored bill last weekend -- and the 1976 platform said
Democrats would ``overhaul federal estate and gift taxes to provide
an effective and equitable structure to promote tax justice and
alleviate some of the legitimate problems faced by farmers, small
businessmen and women and others who would otherwise be forced to
liquidate assets in order to pay the tax.''
</P>
<P>
   Time has rendered once-respectable party positions politically
incorrect, to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, immigration and the platform of 1900. The
Democratic Party declared itself in favor of ``continuance and
strict enforcement of the Chinese exclusion law, and its
application to the same classes of all Asiatic races.''
</P>
<P>
   But other old planks could fit perfectly into this year's
political debate:
</P>
<P>
   Campaign finance reform: ``We pledge the Democratic Party to the
enactment of a law prohibiting any corporation from contributing to
a campaign fund and any individual from contributing any amount
above a reasonable maximum.'' That's from the platform of 1912.
</P>
<P>
   Narcotics: ``Recognizing in narcotics addiction, especially the
spreading of heroin addiction among youth, a grave peril to America
and to the human race, we pledge ourselves vigorously to take
against it all legitimate and proper measures for education,
control and for suppression at home and abroad.'' -- 1924
</P>
<P>
   Family values: ``We hold these truths to be self-evident -- that
government in a modern civilization has certain inescapable
obligations to its citizens, among which are: protection of the
family and the home.'' -- 1936
</P>
<P>
   Prosperity: ``We have achieved the longest and strongest
peacetime prosperity in modern history.'' -- 1964
</P>
<P>
   Global trade: ``World trade is essential to economic stability.
The growing interdependence of nations, particularly in economic
affairs, is an established fact of contemporary life.'' -- 1968
</P>
<P>
   Guns: ``Promote the passage and enforcement of effective
federal, state and local gun control legislation.'' -- 1968
</P>
<P>
   Medicare: ``Medical care for the aged should be expanded to
include the costs of prescription drugs.'' -- 1968
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Over the decades, Democratic platforms heralded a steady parade
of public policy concerns leading to federal action.
</P>
<P>
   In 1928, when the nation was mired in recession, the Democratic
platform urged the government to launch public works projects to
create jobs for the unemployed, and by 1940 the party's platform
asserted ``the obligation of government to provide work for
deserving workers who cannot be absorbed by private industry.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the 1932 Democratic platform call for unemployment and
old age insurance that was precursor to the Social Security Act
four years later.
</P>
<P>
   Affirmative action as a remedy for past discrimination was born
in the Democratic platform of 1972, along with support for
multiculturalism, bilingual education and legal services for the
poor.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic platforms have expanded the national political agenda
to include the principles of economic and social justice, disaster
assistance, farm programs, support for the arts, consumer rights,
occupational health and safety, and the rights of children, women,
poor people, the disabled and the mentally retarded. In 1972, ``the
right to be different'' was a platform plank.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is amazing. If you look back over this century's platforms,
there is a populist thread, a constant theme of Democrats standing
up and fighting for others,'' said Democratic National Chairman Joe
Andrew.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, modern Democratic platforms ranged from support of
abortion rights and demands for ``full warranties'' on new cars, to
warnings about global warning and ozone depletion and the
designation of tobacco as ``the single greatest threat to the
health of children.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the 1996 Democratic platform, echoing Clinton, declared
that ``The era of big government is over.''
</P>
<P>
   If the past is prologue, don't bet on it.

include the costs of prescription drugs.'' -- 1968

<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Over the decades, Democratic platforms heralded a steady parade
of public policy concerns leading to federal action.
</P>
<P>
   In 1928, when the nation was mired in recession, the Democratic
platform urged the government to launch public works projects to
create jobs for the unemployed, and by 1940 the party's platform
asserted ``the obligation of government to provide work for
deserving workers who cannot be absorbed by private industry.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the 1932 Democratic platform call for unemployment and
old age insurance that was precursor to the Social Security Act
four years later.
</P>
<P>
   Affirmative action as a remedy for past discrimination was born
in the Democratic platform of 1972, along with support for
multiculturalism, bilingual education and legal services for the
poor.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic platforms have expanded the national political agenda
to include the principles of economic and social justice, disaster
assistance, farm programs, support for the arts, consumer rights,
occupational health and safety, and the rights of children, women,
poor people, the disabled and the mentally retarded. In 1972, ``the
right to be different'' was a platform plank.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is amazing. If you look back over this century's platforms,
there is a populist thread, a constant theme of Democrats standing
up and fighting for others,'' said Democratic National Chairman Joe
Andrew.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, modern Democratic platforms ranged from support of
abortion rights and demands for ``full warranties'' on new cars, to
warnings about global warning and ozone depletion and the
designation of tobacco as ``the single greatest threat to the
health of children.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the 1996 Democratic platform, echoing Clinton, declared
that ``The era of big government is over.''
</P>
<P>
   If the past is prologue, don't bet on it.

<P>
   Despite its image of arcane intellectuality, particle physics is
fast becoming a field with plenty of heart-pounding, high-stakes
suspense. The reasons lie not so much in the field's recent string
of discoveries as in how some of them were made.
</P>
<P>
   Several large, multinational teams of particle physicists, who
design experiments to capture, measure and understand the most
elementary building blocks of matter, have adopted an analysis
technique that might best be compared to walking a tightrope while
blindfolded.
</P>
<P>
   They hope the technique will help them overcome their problems
with particle ``discoveries'' that turned out to be wishful
thinking, and conflicting results that took decades to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is bias, and it plagues all realms of scientific
experimentation. In medicine, finding statistically beneficial or
disease-causing effects is part of the fabric of research, and
blind studies have been used for decades.
</P>
<P>
   That approach has been difficult to apply to physics, with its
emphasis on discrete effects, from nuclear fission to
superconductivity. But in some cases it can be used in particle
physics, where detectors collect huge numbers of interactions in
order to find a few unusual events or slight differences in
behavior between two types of particles.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, somewhat in the spirit of biomedicine, research teams
in particle physics have been programming their computers to add
unknown numbers, called ``offsets,'' to their data to make the
outcome of their analyses blind. When an experiment is over, the
researchers open their metaphorical sealed envelopes and discover
what the value of the offset is _ learning only then whether they
are close to a routine confirmation of theory, a Nobel Prize or a
humiliating mistake.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, much of the data is ordinary and irrelevant, and
physicists must painstakingly winnow it for a few rare particle
decays _ events so precious that physicists refer to them as
``golden.'' In other cases, physicists must find tiny differences
in millions of decays of two different types of particles.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, physicists' natural eagerness to find new
effects may lead them, in all innocence, to pare the data or make
the comparisons in slightly biased fashion if they can see the
answer as they work. Offsets are designed to prevent that, because
they obscure the bottom line as all those choices are being made.
</P>
<P>
   The teams agree ahead of time to operate completely in the dark
during months of analysis and then to announce publicly whatever
results pop out when the cloak is removed.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Eric Prebys, a particle physicist at Princeton University
who is a member of a large collaboration called Belle, said
scientists ``always want a particular outcome _ whatever they
say.'' Removing all landmarks is the only sure way to insulate them
from their own hopes and expectations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it takes a little bit of courage to do it,'' Prebys
said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the queasy moments of suspense have been followed by
surprise in more than one recent case. That is just the point,
advocates of the method say: There is no chance to redo the
analysis just because the answer looks odd.
</P>
<P>
   The practice can be a salve for physicists who simply want to
get on with the analysis without worrying about what their
subconscious minds might be doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Psychologically, it's better,'' said Dr. Bruce Winstein, a
physicist at the University of Chicago and a member of an
experiment team at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, which
used the technique in work on decaying of particles called kaons,
and whose results were announced last year. ``There's no concern
about, `Do we agree with our old experiment? Do we agree with the
Standard Model?''' _ the theory that correctly describes all
particle physics experiments performed to date.
</P>
<P>
   The reward, said Dr. Aaron Roodman, a physicist at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center who is a member of the large team called
BaBar, is better science and a few thrills for the physicists who
are present when the offset is revealed, and the experiment is
judged either routine or groundbreaking. .
</P>
<P>
   Both the Belle team, centered at the KEK high-energy physics
laboratory in Japan, and the BaBar team, based at the Stanford
accelerator site, announced preliminary new results last week after
using the blind technique, and both had surprises. The experiments
tried to measure a difference, or asymmetry, in the rates at which
particles of matter and antimatter decayed. The crucial parameter
is called sine-two-beta, a number that would be zero in a perfectly
symmetric universe and either positive or negative otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   With the Standard Model predicting a value for sine-two-beta of
between 0.4 and 0.85, BaBar's result came in positive but
unexpectedly low: 0.12. Belle had two separate values corresponding
to different types of decays. One of the values, 0.8, raised no
eyebrows. But when the other blind result came ``out of the box'' a
shocker: A negative 0.6, nowhere near what anyone had predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reaction among some people was, `Could we find a way not
to include the result?''' Prebys said. Then they remembered their
pledge to change nothing once the answer was revealed. Belle
finally merged the two data sets, as planned, and came up with a
middle-of-the-road value of 0.45.
</P>
<P>
   Without the blind analysis, the team would almost certainly have
searched exhaustively for flaws to justify dropping the deviant
result, he said. And even though all the Belle and BaBar numbers
still have wide error bars and are considered preliminary, the
incident ``shows how these biases creep in,'' Prebys said.

<P>
   &LR; Human bias has a long, unhappy history in scientific research.
In retrospect, some of Gregor Mendel's data on heritable traits was
probably too good to be true, but the great Austrian geneticist
knew what he was seeing and may simply have discarded some data
that did not fit.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Arthur Eddington, the British astrophysicist, probably did
the same thing with his team's measurements of the deflection of
starlight over the edge of the sun in 1919. But his results fit the
predictions from Einstein's theory of relativity, which Eddington
was championing at the time and which turned out to be correct.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now think that his photographic plates weren't as stable as
he thought,'' said Dr. Spencer Weart, director of the Center for
History of Physics at the American Institute of Physics. ``Which
isn't to say that a person who's a great scientist like Eddington
isn't entitled to some bias.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists who are either less skilled or less lucky have had
harsher experiences with bias. In the 1980s, scientists at the
Organization for Heavy-Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany,
convinced themselves that they had established to a statistical
certainty of 99.9999 percent that they had discovered either a
bizarre new particle or some other unpredicted event. But the
particle evaporated when physicists tried to find it in other
laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think there's something there and you're very committed
to looking for it, you may lull yourself into saying, `Gee, I've
found it,''' said Dr. Michael Lubell, chairman of the physics
department at City College of New York, who searched for the
particle in experiments at Brookhaven National Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many physicists have learned to take precautions,
especially when searching for rare events amid the confusion of a
much greater number of ordinary processes. In such cases, it is
only by carefully subtracting events with, say, the wrong energy or
mass or decay products that the few golden events emerge. Mistakes
or biases in the subtraction can either erase those events or fail
to remove all of the meaningless background.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tatsuya Nakada, a physicist at the University of Lausanne
and CERN, a European particle physics laboratory, both in
Switzerland, said that one effective way to wipe out biases was to
let several subgroups analyze the data independently and then
compare notes. ``If they disagree, they discuss why they
disagree,'' and work out the kinks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another common method, he said, was to place a sort of mask over
the part of the data in which rare decays would be hiding among the
background, if they were there. Criteria, often called ``cuts,''
are established that eliminate the visible background, and then the
mask is removed. Anything that remains is golden.
</P>
<P>
   The recent experiments at KTeV _ for Kaons at the Tevatron, the
experiment in which Winstein was involved _ as well as Belle and
BaBar took blind analysis a step further, actually showing
researchers false numbers as they refined their analysis of the
data. As it happened, all three experiments were seeking to measure
the matter-antimatter asymmetry, although KTeV was looking at
decaying of kaons while the others looked at B mesons, another
particle.
</P>
<P>
   At KTeV, Dr. Peter Shawhan, a collaborator at Caltech, wrote a
computer program that converted a text string into a number in a
horribly complex way that only the computer could reproduce. The
string was entered, and the number became an unknown offset in all
calculations of their measure of the asymmetry during the analysis.
</P>
<P>
   The BaBar team had an unknown offset, but also shuffled the raw
data in plots used by the team so that no advance hint of the
asymmetry would be revealed, Roodman said. Belle used its own
shuffling procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Like Belle and BaBar, the KTeV result was not what the team had
expected. (And like the others, it still contained a wide
uncertainty. Roodman believes the ultimate utility of the blind
analysis will be to squeeze those inaccuracies to the extreme.)
</P>
<P>
   When asked for his reaction when the result came out of the box,
he said it had been an expletive followed by ``What did we do
wrong?''
</P>
<P>
   The asymmetry was larger than expected from theory. KTeV
published the result.

SOUTH KOREA REPLACES TOP OFFICIALS IN EFFORT TO GET ECONOMY ON
TRACK 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAMUEL LEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ Worried about the slow pace of financial
reforms in South Korea and the stubbornly high debts of its big
businesses and banks, President Kim Dae-jung replaced almost half
of his 19-member cabinet Monday, including the nation's top
economic officials.
</P>
<P>
   The changes, coming halfway though Kim's term of office, were
almost entirely related to the performance of South Korea's
economy, which has made a remarkable recovery since the severe
economic crisis that began nearly three years ago but lately has
been showing signs of increased stress.
</P>
<P>
   Kim selected the new cabinet members based on what his
spokesman, Park Joon-young, called the degree of
``reform-mindedness and expertise under the belief that we must
gain national competitiveness and enter the ranks of advanced
nations in the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   The cabinet shuffle is the second in seven months after Kim
replaced half of his ministers in January ahead of the nation's
April general election.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant change in the cabinet was the appointment
of Jin Nyum, 59, who had been serving as planning and budget
minister, charged with privatizing the nation's state-run
companies, as the new minister of finance and economy.
</P>
<P>
   Jin replaced Lee Hun-jai, who had been appointed in the last
cabinet shuffle. Lee has been criticized for the slow progress in
reducing debts at banks and major business groups and in lowering
control by the founding family members of the nation's powerful
business conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   ``After implementing the first round of corporate and financial
reforms, the government failed to play a strict supervisory role,''
said Nam Jooha, professor of finance and economy at Sogang
University. ``That has led to fears of another economic crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Before his seven-month tenure as finance minister, Lee was head
of the Financial Supervisory Commission, which has been overseeing
the restructuring of the nation's business conglomerates and
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   During the early stages of the government's reform drive shortly
after the economic crisis in late 1997, Lee's strict enforcement of
the government's corporate restructuring plans won him praises from
the foreign business community. Also this week, Lee was
hospitalized for acute appendicitis, and he received news that he
had been dismissed while still in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The most high-profile sign that the previous cabinet had not
been dealing effectively with South Korea's economic problems was
its struggle with the Hyundai Group, the nation's largest business
group. Hyundai has resisted efforts to get the conglomerate's
founder, Chung Ju-yung, and his family, to loosen controlling
stakes in their industrial empire. Despite continued government
pressure and threats from creditor banks to seek immediate
repayment of huge amounts of loans, the Hyundai Group has yet to
produce a plan that promises a reduction of Chung's stake to levels
acceptable to the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in the past, there has been a tendency for
confrontation,'' said James Rooney, former president and chief
executive of Templeton Trust Investment Management Co. in South
Korea. ``I think Jin Nyum is known for being more conciliatory.
There will be more cajoling and encouragement.''
</P>
<P>
   Jin had served as the chairman of the Planning and Budget
Commission since 1998 and became minister in May last year, when
the commission was raised in status to a ministry. He also served
as the court-appointed manager of Kia Motors Corp. in 1997, and was
responsible for rescuing that automaker from a financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   While Jin vowed ``to achieve concrete results within five months
to a year,'' investors did not seem impressed with his appointment.
The Korea Composite Stock Price Index, a barometer of the country's
economic mood, fell 4.85 percent. The new cabinet faces a difficult
task. Despite South Korea's efforts to clean up its bad debts and
untangle decades of murky finances among business conglomerates,
domestic banks are still struggling with billions of dollars of
loans that have not been repaid.
</P>
<P>
   The international debt ratings company, Standard &AMP; Poor's, said
recently that the government would need to spend about $126 billion
or one-third of South Korea's gross domestic product, to clean up
the bad debts in its financial industry.
</P>
<P>
   The president also replaced Lee Yong-keun, the chairman of the
Financial Supervisory Commission, which oversees the restructuring
of the nation's business groups and banks.
</P>
<P>
   The newly appointed chairman of the commission is Lee
Keun-young, 63, chairman of state-run Korea Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Lee also spent 20 years in the finance ministry's tax division
and is credited with playing an important role in the dismantling
of Daewoo Group, once South Korea's second-largest conglomerate,
which owes creditors at least $80 billion.

   The New York Times plans three pages of stories and photos on Al
Gore's selection of Sen. Joseph Lieberman as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   GORE-LIEBERMAN (Nashville, Tenn.) _ Ledeall: Vice President Al
Gore picked Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut to be his running
mate on Monday, putting a Jewish candidate on a national ticket for
the first time in history. Gore will not formally announce his
selection until Tuesday. Lieberman, 58, is known chiefly on the
national stage as the first Democrat to condemn President Clinton
during the Monica Lewinsky scandal, branding his behavior
``immoral.'' By Katharine Q. Seelye. (1250 words)

   LIEBERMAN-PROFILE (Undated) _ Man-in-the-news profile of the
vice presidential candidate. By Robert D. McFadden. (2000 words)
</P>
<P>
   LIEBERMAN-ASSESS (Washington) _ After struggling mightily for
two years to move out of President Clinton's shadow, Vice President
Al Gore, in a bold but risky choice of a running mate, effectively
thrust Clinton and impeachment front and center in the 2000
presidential campaign. It was clear from the Republican convention
last week that the Republicans will not be timid in making the
moral lapses of Clinton a basic subtext of their campaign. The
thinking of the Gore camp is that by picking Lieberman, the most
vociferous critic of Clinton during the impeachment proceedings,
Gore will confront such criticism head on and underscore his
independence from the President. While no one can predict how the
Lieberman choice will play, one thing is certain: it was not a
play-it-safe choice as was Gov. George W. Bush's selection of Dick
Cheney. There several obvious plusses to the Lieberman choice _ but
there are also several minuses. A news analysis by Richard L.
Berke. (1350 words)
</P>
<P>
   LIEBERMAN-RECORD (Washington) _ In two terms in the Senate,
Joseph Lieberman has often taken positions at odds with Vice
President Al Gore and important constituencies of the Democratic
party on school vouchers, regulation of managed care, capital gains
taxes and product liability. But he sided with the Clinton
administration on all important budget votes, and unlike many other
Democrats, supported the administration's positions on trade and
welfare. His views are completely in tune with the vice president's
on abortion, the environment, gun control and gay rights. And he
usually supported the Clinton administration on foreign policy
issues. By David E. Rosenbaum. (1125 words)
</P>
<P>
   LIEBERMAN-REACT (Washington) _ Republicans reacted to the
selection of Sen. Joseph Lieberman as Vice President Al Gore's
running mate Monday by praising the choice but contending that
Lieberman had major differences with Gore and his conservative
votes would not help the ticket with core Democratic voters. But
spokesmen for labor, teachers, environmental and abortion rights
groups enthusiastically spoke out for Gore and brushed off his
occasional votes against their positions as unimportant. By Adam
Clymer. (1125 words)

<P>
   LIEBERMAN-RIGHT (Undated) _ In Sen. Joseph Lieberman, Al Gore
has managed to choose as his running mate an Orthodox Jew whom many
Christians _ and especially conservative evangelicals _ regard an
ally on many social and moral issues. Although he wears a yarmulke
on his head, Lieberman has been seen by some Christians as a
kindred spirit for his willingness to wear his religion on his
sleeve. His talk of the Talmud inspiring both his values and his
vote has often been cited by those Christians who believe the Bible
ought to guide public policy. By Laurie Goodstein. (990 words)
</P>
<P>
   LIEBERMAN-JEWS (New York) _ Regardless of political leanings or
depth of spirituality, American Jews expressed great pride Monday
that one of their own, Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, had
been picked by Vice President Al Gore to be his running mate. By

   LIEBERMAN-CLINTON (Undated) _ In a Senate speech on Sept. 3,

impeaching the president, giving his reasons in a statement
released on Feb. 11, 1999. Exerpts from these two statements. (1750

COMMENTARY: A WHOLE NEW WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the 1976 election campaign, Jimmy Carter vowed to withdraw
U.S. troops from South Korea. When Carter won, the first words he
had to eat were his vow to withdraw U.S. troops from South Korea,
as Congress and the allies revolted against him.
</P>
<P>
   Should George W. Bush win, it is useful to consider how
different a world he and his foreign policy advisers would confront
from the last time Colin Powell, Dick Cheney, Condi Rice and Paul
Wolfowitz were in office with President Bush eight years ago. The
book on Governor Bush is that while he doesn't know much about the
world, his advisers _ who were all his father's advisers _ are
experts. That is true, but many are experts in a world that doesn't
exist anymore: We do not have a Cold War global system anymore, we
don't have a Cold War military and we don't have a Cold War public.
In short, this ain't your father's foreign policy. The players may
be the same, but the world isn't. Here are five things President
Bush could never have taught his son about the world:
</P>
<P>
   1. While America was certainly a superpower when Bush left
office, its economy was just coming out of stagnation and the
Soviet Union had not totally collapsed. Today, America is not just
a superpower, it's a hyperpower, with both unrivaled military might
and an information economy that is the envy of the world.
</P>
<P>
   What's new in all this is that while other countries still call
for U.S. leadership, they envy and resent America more than ever.
No one wants to be America's enemy, but few want to be perceived as
its friend. And what that means is that if Bush tries out some of
the more macho-unilateralist policies talked about by his advisers
_ such as abrogating the ABM treaty or sponsoring an uprising in
Iraq _ he will face a ferocious backlash from U.S. rivals and
allies alike.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, because of U.S. economic sanctions on Iraq, Saddam
Hussein is now more popular than ever on the Arab street. Indeed, I
am sorry to report, a huge cheer would go up from the Arab street
today if Iraq were to acquire nuclear weapons to counterbalance the
United States and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   2. Bush had to manage the waxing military power of China, the
waning military power of the Soviet Union and the soaring economic
power of Japan. What U.S. foreign policy is about today is managing
the weakness of China, the weakness of Russia and the weakness of
Japan, as all three go through the wrenching internal adjustments
to globalization that have made their possible collapse more
threatening to us than their strength. In the Bush years, U.S.
officials liked to say ``We lead, Japan pays.'' Now we must lead
and pay.
</P>
<P>
   3. The Internet did not exist as a foreign policy tool when Bush
left office. Today, it's huge. Jody Williams won the Nobel Peace
Prize for organizing a global ban on land mines _ against the
wishes of the major powers _using e-mail. If Governor Bush really
did try to abrogate the ABM treaty unilaterally, and cram it down
the throats of the Russians and Europeans, I believe it could
trigger a Seattle-like, Internet-driven, mass-based, anti-nuclear
protest against the United States _ identical to the popular
movement in Europe today against America's genetically modified
foods. This could make it impossible for any NATO ally to cooperate
with the United States on missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
   4. America was a deficit country when Bush left office, and now
it is a surplus country. That means that the Republican ethos of
steadily cutting back government, and the foreign affairs budget,
is not only unnecessary, it's reckless, and it will be perceived by
the world as increasingly selfish.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it's easy for the Bushies to sneer that they won't be
the world's 911 or global cops, but such aloofness is much harder
in practice now that America is so dominant. As the Clintonites
discovered, we are now held responsible for everything, but
Americans don't want to die for virtually anything. So finding ways
to make a sustainable difference in places such as Kosovo or Rwanda
is a lot harder than uttering a sound bite.
</P>
<P>
   5. Globalization: The speed, interconnectivity and economic
impact of global markets today is much greater than eight years
ago. If Bush does try a deep tax cut that the markets perceive as
reckless, their judgment on him will be nasty, brutish and swift _
swifter than he may ever imagine.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that _ nothing's changed.

   The New York Times plans three pages of stories and photos on Al
Gore's selection of Sen. Joseph Lieberman as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   GORE-LIEBERMAN (Nashville, Tenn.) _ Ledeall: Vice President Al
Gore picked Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut to be his running
mate on Monday, putting a Jewish candidate on a national ticket for
the first time in history. Gore will not formally announce his
selection until Tuesday. Lieberman, 58, is known chiefly on the
national stage as the first Democrat to condemn President Clinton
during the Monica Lewinsky scandal, branding his behavior
``immoral.'' By Katharine Q. Seelye. (1250 words)

   LIEBERMAN-PROFILE (Undated) _ Man-in-the-news profile of the
vice presidential candidate. By Robert D. McFadden. (2000 words)
</P>
<P>
   LIEBERMAN-ASSESS (Washington) _ After struggling mightily for
two years to move out of President Clinton's shadow, Vice President
Al Gore, in a bold but risky choice of a running mate, effectively
thrust Clinton and impeachment front and center in the 2000
presidential campaign. It was clear from the Republican convention
last week that the Republicans will not be timid in making the
moral lapses of Clinton a basic subtext of their campaign. The
thinking of the Gore camp is that by picking Lieberman, the most
vociferous critic of Clinton during the impeachment proceedings,
Gore will confront such criticism head on and underscore his
independence from the President. While no one can predict how the
Lieberman choice will play, one thing is certain: it was not a
play-it-safe choice as was Gov. George W. Bush's selection of Dick
Cheney. There several obvious plusses to the Lieberman choice _ but
there are also several minuses. A news analysis by Richard L.
Berke. (1350 words)
</P>
<P>
   LIEBERMAN-RECORD (Washington) _ In two terms in the Senate,
Joseph Lieberman has often taken positions at odds with Vice
President Al Gore and important constituencies of the Democratic
party on school vouchers, regulation of managed care, capital gains
taxes and product liability. But he sided with the Clinton
administration on all important budget votes, and unlike many other
Democrats, supported the administration's positions on trade and
welfare. His views are completely in tune with the vice president's
on abortion, the environment, gun control and gay rights. And he
usually supported the Clinton administration on foreign policy
issues. By David E. Rosenbaum. (1125 words)
</P>
<P>
   LIEBERMAN-REACT (Washington) _ Republicans reacted to the
selection of Sen. Joseph Lieberman as Vice President Al Gore's
running mate Monday by praising the choice but contending that
Lieberman had major differences with Gore and his conservative
votes would not help the ticket with core Democratic voters. But
spokesmen for labor, teachers, environmental and abortion rights
groups enthusiastically spoke out for Gore and brushed off his
occasional votes against their positions as unimportant. By Adam
Clymer. (1125 words)
</P>
<P>
   (MOVED)
</P>
<P>
   LIEBERMAN-RIGHT (Undated) _ In Sen. Joseph Lieberman, Al Gore
has managed to choose as his running mate an Orthodox Jew whom many
Christians _ and especially conservative evangelicals _ regard an
ally on many social and moral issues. Although he wears a yarmulke
on his head, Lieberman has been seen by some Christians as a
kindred spirit for his willingness to wear his religion on his
sleeve. His talk of the Talmud inspiring both his values and his
vote has often been cited by those Christians who believe the Bible
ought to guide public policy. By Laurie Goodstein. (990 words)
</P>
<P>
   LIEBERMAN-JEWS (New York) _ Regardless of political leanings or
depth of spirituality, American Jews expressed great pride Monday
that one of their own, Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, had
been picked by Vice President Al Gore to be his running mate. By
Clyde Haberman. (990 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo, NYT9.
</P>
<P>
   LIEBERMAN-CLINTON (Undated) _ In a Senate speech on Sept. 3,
1998, Sen. Joseph Lieberman sharply criticized President Clinton's
conduct in the Monica Lewinsky matter, but he voted against
impeaching the president, giving his reasons in a statement
released on Feb. 11, 1999. Exerpts from these two statements. (1750
words)
</P>
<P>
   GORE-ANNOUNCE (Undated) _ The Gore campaign is getting all the

   Gore's VP pick rivals Clinton, not Cheney
</P>
<P>
   By Tom Baxter
</P>
<P>
   c 2000 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA - With as long as they've had to look at the short list,
Vice President Al Gore wasn't likely to throw the Republicans off
balance with his choice of a running mate. But in picking Sen.
Joseph Lieberman, Gore may have achieved the closest thing to
leverage he could have hoped for.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman isn't the anti-Cheney some in the Bush camp thought
Gore might choose: a Democrat with youth and pizazz to counter Gov.
George W. Bush's choice of former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Any of the others on the short list _ Sen. John Edwards of North
Carolina, Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana and Sen. John Kerry of
Massachusetts, would have been more of a counter to Cheney than
Lieberman. Instead, Lieberman can be thought of as a counter to
Gore's former running mate, President Clinton _ and a finely
balanced one. The Connecticut Democrat was the first leader in his
party to denounce Clinton's personal behavior during the Monica
Lewinsky affair, but he also holds one of the president's old jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Now in his fifth year, Lieberman holds the record for the
longest term at the helm of the Democratic Leadership Council, the
centrist, business-friendly organization that Clinton chaired when
he was governor of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   That association gives Lieberman a claim on Clinton's economic
legacy, without an endorsement of his peccadillos _ which is where
the Gore campaign wanted to be.
</P>
<P>
   If his advantages are so obvious now that he's picked, why
didn't Lieberman stand out more on the short list?
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman is the first Jew ever chosen for the vice-presidential
nomination, which may have seemed a deficit a couple of days ago,
when Democratic National Committee chairman Ed Rendell remarked
that Lieberman would be a ``slam-dunk'' if he wasn't Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he's the nominee, however, there doesn't seem much
downside, and Rendell's comment sounds in retrospect a bit much
like a setup line. The ticket might lose some votes simply because
he is Jewish, but Lieberman will be an asset to the Democrats in
those states _ California, Illinois, Florida and New York _ where
they have to begin gaining ground back from the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman is Orthodox, which will set off a quite separate
conversation within the American Jewish community. For the rest of
America, the biggest upshot of this is that in an age of
considerable lip service to ``faith traditions,'' he is one
candidate who actively practices one.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason Lieberman may not have been high on the radar
screens, however, is that for whatever his advantages, he doesn't
leap out as a choice for a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Selecting the the 58-year-old former Connecticut attorney
general insures that this will be the first presidential election
in a decade with no big generational differences between the two
tickets, and that deprives Gore-Lieberman of part of the excitement
the Clinton-Gore ticket generated.
</P>
<P>
   In his younger days, Lieberman organized anti-war rallies, but
the mature man is identified among the Washington scolds who decry
violent video games, dirty rap lyrics and other signs of moral
decline. That's part of the reason he's a good antidote to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But you can't be a scold on the stump. How well will Lieberman
play with all those crowds to whom Clinton played so well? We
should know shortly.

 &HT;    Religion no conflict with job, senator says
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The most important Jewish holidays fall during the
grueling campaign sprint between Labor Day and the election. Don't
expect Sen. Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.), an Orthodox Jew, to choose
politics over worship.
</P>
<P>
   But if elected vice president, Lieberman already has made it
clear that he will not set aside his duties because of religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always tried to separate pure politics on the Sabbath,
which I don't do, from governmental responsibility,'' he said in an
interview with The New York Times last month. ``It seems to me my
religion, as I understand it, not only permits me to fulfill
important work associated with being a public servant, but actually
requires me to do so because people are depending on me. I don't
see that as an issue at all.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, he has cast votes on Saturday, the Jewish
Sabbath, although he has walked to work to adhere to restrictions
on using cars on the Sabbath. Of the three main branches of Judaism
in the United States _ Reform, Conservative and Orthodox, the
Orthodox are the most observant.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman will be the first Jew on a major party's presidential
ticket. If the past is any guide, he will not campaign on the
Sabbath or on Jewish holidays.
</P>
<P>
   When Lieberman ran against Republican incumbent Sen. Lowell
Weicker in 1988, he did not attend the Connecticut Democratic
convention that nominated him. Instead, he sent a videotaped speech
to the Saturday gathering.
</P>
<P>
   He missed 17 campaign days that year between Labor Day and the
election, and he won a very close election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here you have a politician to whom visibly something other
than politics is important,'' said Rabbi Barry Freundel, leader of
the Kesher Israel Synagogue that Lieberman attends in Georgetown.
``But he is not a guy who comes up to you and says, `Hi, I'm an
Orthodox Jew.'''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of Jewish groups praised Lieberman's selection as a
milestone in American politics, and several political scientists
said Lieberman's religion would matter only to a very small segment
of the electorate that already was unlikely to vote for Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The Gallup organization, which has measured Americans'
willingness to vote for Jewish candidates for the past 60 years,
found last year that 92 percent of Americans said they would vote
for a Jew for president.
</P>
<P>
   But there remains some uncertainty about how the nation will
react to the prospect of a Jew being a heartbeat away from the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone can calculate the effect of having a Jew
on the ticket,'' Democratic Party Chairman Ed Rendell, who is
Jewish, said last week.
</P>
<P>
   And James Thurber, a political science professor at American
University, said Lieberman's views about Israel and the Middle East
may be a legitimate issue in the campaign. But Lieberman's strong
support for Israel places him with the vast majority of his Senate
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's rise to national prominence may serve to heighten
the nation's awareness of what it means to be Jewish, beyond
expressions and ethnic foods that have become American staples.
</P>
<P>
   On that front, there apparently is some work to do.
</P>
<P>
   A Southern Democrat jumped to Lieberman's defense Monday, saying
Lieberman's religion will not count against him in the presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Americans do not care, Sen. John Breaux (D-La.) said, where
someone ``goes to church on Sunday.''

MOST JEWS EXPRESS PRIDE AT CHOICE OF LIEBERMAN

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK - Joseph I. Lieberman, vice-presidential candidate _
good for the Jews or bad for the Jews?
</P>
<P>
   That was the question Jews all over the country were pondering
Monday, as Al Gore named the Senator from Connecticut to be his
running-mate _ the first Jew ever picked to run for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Many Jewish leaders expressed pride and celebrated the event _
but many were also more than a little nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Schneier, rabbi at Park East Synagogue, one of the
largest modern Orthodox temples in Manhattan, was completely
positive. ``It shows the maturity of American democracy,'' he said.
``It's a transformation of America. This would not have happened 25
years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Haskell Lookstein, the rabbi at Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun,
another large modern Orthodox synagogue, agreed: ``Jews are very
well-integrated in the American mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic political consultant and an
observant Jew, also dismissed the notion of controversy. ``After
years of `Seinfeld,' '' he said, ``who cares?''
</P>
<P>
   But others are less certain.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Gordon, the rabbi at Germantown Jewish Center, a
conservative synagogue in Philadelphia, spent much of Monday
perusing an Internet chat-line of conservative rabbis across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consensus,'' he said, ``is that this is a disaster. Nobody
who's sent in e-mail is happy about it.''
</P>
<P>
   At one level, Gordon said, a Vice President Lieberman would make
``a great role model for Jewish kids _ here's an observant Jew
who's made it at the highest realm of American politics.''
</P>
<P>
   But at another level, he went on, ``People are nervous that this
is raising our profile to a place where we can be shot at. It's not
so much explicit anti-Semitism that's worrisome. It's that the
quirkier parts of traditional Judaism will be out there in the
public domain, misunderstood, joked about.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman is Jewish in a way that goes well beyond the
pop-culture portrait of Judaism _ the bagels, Yiddishisms, and
stand-up comic neuroses.
</P>
<P>
   He is an active Orthodox Jew, which means, first and foremost,
that he observes Shabbot, the Jewish Sabbath. From Friday sundown
to Saturday sundown, he cannot travel except by foot; he cannot use
the telephone or any other electrical device; he cannot turn a
lightswitch on or off; he cannot carry anything outside the home.
</P>
<P>
   Several rabbis emphasized that these prohibitions would not
prevent Lieberman from carrying out important official duties on
the Sabbath. The Talmud, the book of Jewish law, states that
life-or-death situations override all other restrictions (except
those forbidding murder, adultery or idolatry). And this exemption
could be interpreted to include various duties of the state.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, for example, rabbinic councils have ruled that
Orthodox soldiers are allowed to engage in routine army activities,
even when they are not facing mortal danger.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Barth, dean of the Academy for Jewish Religion, a
Manhattan seminary, said Lieberman could even attend a Saturday
session of the Senate to cast a deciding vote _ though he would
have to walk to the Capitol to do so. Lieberman, as Senator,
currently maintains an apartment within walking distance of the
Capitol, for just this reason.
</P>
<P>
   However, traveling on the Sabbath _ to campaign or attend a
foreign dignitary's funeral, for example _ would probably not be
allowed.
</P>
<P>
   A larger issue, in terms of the upcoming election, is whether
people will consider all these strictures a little strange.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, where Jews comprise one-eighth of the electorate
statewide, Lieberman's name on the ticket might even help Gore,
perhaps lure some conservative Jews who were leaning toward George
W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Sheinkopf said Lieberman will also help Hillary Rodham Clinton's
Senate bid ``enormously,'' because these Jews, once motivated to
vote for Gore, ``will stay with the Democratic line.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, pollster John Zogby, while agreeing that
Lieberman might shore up Gore in New York, said, ``I think the
Hillary race stands alone. People consider it a separate matter.''
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, though, there is concern among some Jews that,
beneath the surface of modern pluralism and tolerance,
anti-Semitism might not be entirely a thing of the past. After all,
Bush publicly expressed the opinion, not long ago, that
non-Christians will not be let into Heaven. Some outrage was
voiced, but not enough to deny him the Republican nomination for
President.
</P>
<P>
   Some worry that underlying suspicions and hostilities might be
stirred up if an Orthodox Jew _ even a modern Orthodox Jew, who
feels no need to wear the black garb of fundamentalists _ is
hoisted to such a high and visible place in political life.
</P>
<P>
   However, others feel it is high time for American Jews to tear
away their insecurities. Rabbi Schneier _ who survived the
Holocaust, came to this country after World War II, and worked very
hard to lose his accent so he could fit in to the then-narrow
straits of American life _ sees Lieberman's emergence as the
fulfillment of his pluralist dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Lookstein pointed to how John F. Kennedy wiped away
anti-Catholic sentiment in the 1960 election. However, when asked
if Jews today are better-integrated into American society than
Catholics were 40 years ago, he paused and replied, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, he noted that the suspicions about Kennedy concerned
whether he might be ordered around by the Pope, whereas Judaism
doesn't have a single spiritual leader. There might be questions
about loyalty to Israel, but, Lookstein said, ``Nearly every
American politician is pro-Israel. Israel is about as American as
apple pie.''

<P>
   The Invisible Man was never like this.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of Claude Rains simply disappearing as he unwraps his
bandages, (beginitalic)Hollow Man (enditalic)features fantastic
transformation sequences as bodies dissolve before our very eyes.
</P>
<P>
   In a special-effects showcase, skin melts away, replaced by bone
and sinew. Muscles gradually disappear until there's only a
skeleton. Finally, the bones seem to disintegrate, and there's
nothing left.
</P>
<P>
   If you think that's something, you should see it in reverse.
</P>
<P>
   And in (beginitalic)Hollow Man(enditalic), you do. The
disappearing and reappearing trick is trotted out several times,
and it never fails to impress. We've come a long way from Lon
Chaney Jr. turning into a werewolf.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, those old horror movies had substance and style,
which (beginitalic)Hollow Man (enditalic)clearly lacks. While the
special effects and a wisecracking Kevin Bacon are enough to carry
the first 90 minutes, the movie unravels in the final act.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the film devolves into something akin to
(beginitalic)Alien:(enditalic) a monster on the loose with our
brave crew trying to find it and survive in the process. It's also
quite the gore fest, with gallons of blood and mangled corpses
everywhere. Not to mention explosions - lots of explosions.
</P>
<P>
   Though (beginitalic)Hollow Man (enditalic)would have worked much
better as an understated thriller, director Paul Verhoeven just
couldn't resist returning to his blood-soaked
(beginitalic)RoboCop-Total Recall (enditalic)roots.
</P>
<P>
   That's too bad because the movie starts out with promise as we
meet Sebastian Caine (Bacon), a cocky, egotistical researcher who
has developed an invisibility serum. Caine, who is working with the
military - invisible soldiers being a pretty formidable weapon -
first tests his serum on animals but becomes convinced it will work
on humans.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon does a nice job developing the character, who takes an
almost boyish glee in his work while being reckless at the same
time. He also lightens the tone with good comic timing.
</P>
<P>
   Like brave researchers before him, Sebastian decides to test the
invisibility serum on himself, with the help of his lovely
assistant, Linda McKay (Elisabeth Shue), and granite-jawed
researcher Matthew Kensington (Josh Brolin). Naturally, Linda is
Sebastian's old flame, and she's now dating Matthew behind his
back.
</P>
<P>
   From there, it's the old good-news, bad-news scenario. It's
pretty easy to make Sebastian disappear. But making him reappear
proves a little tougher.
</P>
<P>
   With Sebastian invisible, the movie rolls out the inventive
special effects, adding clever touches throughout. The audience can
have fun counting the ways to spot the invisible man, at least for
a few seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Sebastian is not the nicest guy, so he ultimately becomes the
world's most scientifically advanced peeping Tom, and worse.
Gradually, the whole thing begins to work on his mind, with
somewhat unfortunate results.
</P>
<P>
   Being invisible has other drawbacks, especially for an audience.
Ultimately, Verhoeven must have realized that the viewers need to
see Sebastian for part of the time, so he replaced Rains' bandages
with a crude latex mask.
</P>
<P>
   When Sebastian removes his sunglasses, he's literally
empty-headed.
</P>
<P>
   And there's no better way to describe (beginitalic)Hollow
Man(enditalic).

 &HT;    `SPACE COWBOYS' GOES WHERE PLOTS HAVE GONE BEFORE(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By BILL MULLER(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In space, no one can hear you yawn.
</P>
<P>
   And that's a good thing, too, especially when it comes to
(beginitalic)Space Cowboys(enditalic), a by-the-numbers action
picture that dusts off every old saw in the tool shed.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe a movie with Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee
Jones and Donald Sutherland can be this dull and silly. But
(beginitalic)Space Cowboys (enditalic)manages it easily, mostly
through a painfully formulaic, predictable script.
</P>
<P>
   Example: At the beginning of the film, younger versions of
Eastwood and Jones parachute out of a crippled plane, after Jones'
character pulls a wild stunt. So what does Clint do when they land?
Naturally, he walks right over and punches Jones in the kisser.
Isn't that cute?
</P>
<P>
   The dialogue is so cliched that the Loud Plot Explainer sitting
behind me managed to deliver every punch line before the stars
could. And unlike the characters in the movie, this guy was no
rocket scientist.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, (beginitalic)Space Cowboys(enditalic) is like a
comfortable old shoe. We know how things are going to play out, and
it's supposed to be fun to watch Eastwood squint and deliver his
lines in a gravelly voice as he and the gang go through the
motions.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood plays Frank Corvin, a former test pilot and engineer
who's called on to repair a wayward Russian satellite, because it
employs an obsolete guidance system that only he understands. Only
problem is, Frank is pushing 70, much like the other members of his
team, who were set to go into space in the late '50s, only to be
passed over for a monkey.
</P>
<P>
   They include flashy pilot Hawk Hawkins (Jones), astrophysicist
Jerry O'Neil (Sutherland) and robotics expert Tank Sullivan (James
Garner). Yes, we know Garner did a bad movie named
(beginitalic)Tank(enditalic), and here he is as Tank again. How
clever.
</P>
<P>
   Frank's foil is NASA bureaucrat Bob Gerson (James Cromwell).
Frank and Gerson spend a lot of time arguing in Gerson's dimly lit
office, when his assistant (Marcia Gay Harden) is not giving dull
briefings in a dimly lit conference room.
</P>
<P>
   The movie spends an inordinate amount of time with boilerplate
(beginitalic)Armageddon(enditalic)-type setup: Frank assembles his
team members, who are scattered around the country. They are all
doing supposedly hilarious things (Garner is a preacher, Sutherland
a roller coaster designer, etc.), and Frank must coax them back
into the space program.
</P>
<P>
   The training sequences bring the occasional chuckle. Frank and
his fellow senior citizens have to pass NASA's tough physical
tests, and there are plenty of scenes of them doubled over on the
running track or trying to outdo those whippersnappers in the
weight room.
</P>
<P>
   The film is also filled with all those tired arguments, which we
know can only end one way. Frank initially turns down NASA and then
shows up; Hawk turns down Frank and then changes his mind. Gerson
tells Frank he can't go, when the whole audience knows there is no
movie if Clint Eastwood doesn't end up in outer space.
</P>
<P>
   Once they get into space, the movie gets really silly, with plot
holes you could drive the space shuttle through. But at this point,
you are so anesthetized by the tinny dialogue and deadly dull
setup, you may not even notice. The ending is just as predictable,
and there are at least three major plot points left unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   But hey, who's counting?

ADVERTISING: REPORT SAYS INTERNET GROWTH WILL DRIVE OVERALL AD
SALES 
</HEADLINE>
 (Spelling Rutherfurd is CQ) 
 By JANE L. LEVERE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In its annual forecast, Veronis Suhler, the investment banking
firm, predicted that the popularity of the Internet as an
advertising and information medium will continue to increase
rapidly in the short term, though not to the exclusion of more
traditional media like magazines and newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's 14th annual communications industry forecast,
released on Monday, found that total advertiser spending grew 9.1
percent, to $165 billion, last year; it expects spending to grow
8.6 percent annually, climbing to $249.1 billion in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, this growth ``will be driven largely by
Internet advertising, which exploded 140.6 percent, to $4.6 billion
in 1999 and is forecast to increase at a 39.5 percent compound
annual growth rate, more than quadrupling to $24.4 billion by
2004.''
</P>
<P>
   The report said the growth in online ad spending should account
for nearly a quarter of total advertising growth predicted for all
segments through 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Should Veronis Suhler's predictions pan out, by 2004, Internet
advertising will exceed consumer magazine advertising, which is
projected to reach $16.4 billion; network television advertising,
estimated at $19.4 billion; and cable television advertising, a
projected $21 billion. It should then be close to radio
advertising, projected to climb to $26.6 billion. Daily newspapers
are still expected to generate the highest advertising income, an
estimated $63.2 billion in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet will continue to stimulate media growth almost
across the board, said James P. Rutherfurd, executive vice
president of Veronis Suhler, which is based in New York. ``The good
news is that it has sparked a metamorphosis for traditional
media,'' he said. ``By developing content-rich Web sites and
information portals, traditional publishers and television networks
are positioning themselves to capture their share of revenue
diverted to the Web over the next several years.''
</P>
<P>
   The report found that newspapers had lost some classified and
real estate advertising to the Internet. But newspapers have offset
these losses with strong national advertising, increased dot-com ad
spending and development of online classified advertising programs.
Another positive trend for newspapers, the report said, was the
aging of the United States population, since 71 percent of people
over the age of 35 read a newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the forecast said that ``contrary to popular
thought, television viewing is not being cannibalized by growing
Internet use.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead,'' the report said, ``many Internet users actually
watch television while surfing _ in a majority of households,
computers are co-located in the living or family room with the
television.''
</P>
<P>
   It also said that ``while the television market has benefited
from dot-com ad dollars, this influx is not expected to last, as
some Internet entities change their advertising emphasis to more
targeted media.''
</P>
<P>
   Veronis Suhler said this development should be positive for
consumer magazines, which, with their large, targeted audiences,
have become an increasingly attractive advertising vehicle for
dot-coms. These publications have proved ``very resilient when it
comes to the Internet's growing reach,'' the report said, in part
because the Web ``has so far been unable to successfully duplicate
the look, feel and ease of use of magazines and other printed media
and is unlikely to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is easy for search and comparison shopping, but
not for random access,'' Rutherfurd said. ``If you're looking for
what's going on in the sports world, for example, flipping through
a magazine or newspaper, with a catchy picture or headline, is
better than surfing page after page on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The forecast also predicted that although the decline in
broadcast television ratings has slowed since 1997, it will resume
after the 2000 elections, the Sydney Olympics and the recent spike
generated by reality-based programming.
</P>
<P>
   It projected that interactive entertainment _ PC games and
console video games, like Sega's Dreamcast system _ would have the
highest growth rate of any segment of the communications industry
through 2004. Hourly use per person per year of video games is
forecast to climb 21.5 percent through 2004, on top of a 29.4
percent annual increase between 1995 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, between 1995 and 1999, hourly annual
Internet use rose 106.8 percent. That growth is expected to
moderate to 18.4 percent through 2004.

</P>
<P>
   ``PURPLE CANE ROAD''
</P>
<P>
   by James Lee Burke
</P>
<P>
   (Doubleday, $24.95)
</P>
<P>
   Burke has been called the Faulkner of crime fiction, and while
we might quibble with the particulars, there's no denying that he's
very, very good. His characters inhabit his setting - the darker
corners of Louisiana - with consummate ease, and he makes few of
the missteps common to other writers, mistakes that disrupt a
reader's easy way through a violent and sometimes tawdry story. In
Burke's new novel, detective Dave Robicheaux learns from a New
Orleans pimp some sketchy details about the death of Robicheaux's
mother, an alleged prostitute whom he has not seen since he was in
high school. Robicheaux's obsessive search for more information
takes him through a maze of colorful characters, any one of whom
could carry a novel alone. The book's only flaw is its ending,
which has so many twists that it seems calculated. Otherwise,
there's no beating the rich, sweaty atmosphere of the bayou country
Burke portrays so well.

<P>
   ``THE WEALTH OF CHOICES''
</P>
<P>
   by Alan Murray
</P>
<P>
   (Crown, $24.95)
</P>
<P>
   Murray, Washington Bureau chief for the(beginitalic) Wall Street
Journal(enditalic) and columnist at
(beginitalic)SmartMoney(enditalic) magazine, starts his book with a
quiz that's supposed to tell if you are prepared to succeed in the
New Economy. New &AMP; Notable took this quiz, and we are dazed to
report that we scored very high - a fact that probably says more
about Murray's questions than our financial savvy. Indeed, much of
his book is just a compendium of common sense, filtered through the
sensibilities of the Internet age. His advice: Use your computer to
get information on car prices, airfares, stocks, insurance rates,
long-distance phone service. Dicker over everything you buy -
sellers often lower their prices. And don't buy the fancy model
when the standard model will do. There's not a whole lot of new
information here, but it's an effective, entry-level pep talk for
people who are intimidated by money and by the decisions that will
determine their financial futures.
</P>
<P>
   ``WRITING ON DRUGS''
</P>
<P>
   by Sadie Plant
</P>
<P>
   (FSG, $24)
</P>
<P>
   Robert Louis Stevenson wrote (beginitalic)The Strange Case of
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (enditalic)during six days and nights of a
cocaine high. Wilkie Collins dictated the last part of
(beginitalic)The Moonstone (enditalic)under the effects of opium.
``When it was finished,'' he said, ``I was not only pleased and
astonished at the finale but did not recognize it as my own.''
Anais Nin's diaries contain florid accounts of her LSD dreams, and
speed gave Philip K. Dick (beginitalic)Do Androids Dream of
(enditalic)(beginitalic)Electric Sleep(enditalic)?, the book that
became (beginitalic)Blade Runner(enditalic). Plant explores the
history of drugs and their use by writers of the last two
centuries. Her book is thought-provoking and packed with
information we're not sure we wanted to know. We learned, for
instance, that Frederic-Auguste Bartholdi, the architect of the
Statue of Liberty, was a coke enthusiast. ``It is very probable
that had I taken it 20 years ago,'' he said, ``the Statue of
Liberty would have attained the height of several hundred meters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``THE RICH AND HOW THEY GOT THAT WAY''
</P>
<P>
   by Cynthia Crossen
</P>
<P>
   (Crown, $25.95)
</P>
<P>
   ``When I fight,'' Hetty Green once said, ``there is usually a
funeral, and it isn't mine.'' She was a driven, demented, stingy
and unpleasant woman at a time when Victorian ladies were expected
to be gracious and demure. But when she died in 1916, she was worth
$100 million - more than $1 billion in today's dollars. Crossen
profiles some of the wealthiest people of all time, from
11th-century plunderer Machmud of Ghazni (who accumulated wealth by
saying ``That's mine,'' and killing anyone who disagreed) to the
sleazy and corrupt Pope Alexander VI, who made his fortune during
the 15th century through shameless use of divine imperative, and to
Bill Gates, whose monopolistic methods look like church work by
comparison. Sadly, of the 10 people here, only one is a woman, but
we like Hetty best. ``I go my own way, take no partners, risk no
one else's fortune,'' she once said, ``therefore I am Madame
Ishmael, set against every man.''

   The peak months of the hurricane season begin with August, and
though we're more concerned here with blowing dust and palm fronds
than storms of mass destruction, the National Hurricane Center's
official site offers armchair meteorologists as much data as they
can handle. No, more. In addition to up-to-the-minute satellite
images, landlocked storm buffs will find tracking charts and
detailed accounts of aircraft reconnaissance missions as well as
long-term forecasts. (According to the center, conditions have
aligned to make this season a busy one, at least in the Atlantic.)
If the Weather Channel isn't interactive enough for you, this could

   In the cover story, Robert J. Sternberg asks readers to cast
themselves in their own love story. The idea: ``As much as
psychologists have attempted to explain the mysteries of love
through scientific laws and theories, it turns out that the best
mirrors of romantic experience may be (beginitalic)Wuthering
Heights, Casablanca (enditalic)and (beginitalic)General
Hospital(enditalic)(beginitalic),(enditalic)'' he writes. A reader
quiz helps decide your type - you know, cop or comedian, princess
or martyr. We took the quiz on our lunch hour and discovered that
our type is one of the lesser (beginitalic)Chicken Run
(enditalic)hens. (beginitalic)Bawk(enditalic)! Other features
include a short list of a few new concepts in infant development
and an iffy examination of intuition headlined, ``Do we really have
a sixth sense?'' Later, Roger Fouts confesses that one of his
oldest and dearest friends is a chimpanzee.

   Staying rooted in a restless world is this issue's theme, and
the centerpiece is Bill Kauffman's celebration of provincialism. He
picks big government, big business and Hollywood as the culprits in
our drift toward soul-sapping rootlessness. ``For almost 60 years,
the placeless have waged war on the rooted, stealing their
children, devastating their neighborhoods, wiping out local
peculiarities and idiosyncrasies,'' he writes. ``What we have is
class war - though this war has never been acknowledged because the
casualties are places and attachments and sentiments; nothings,
really; everythings, in fact - waged by the mobile against the
immobile, by the cosmopolitan against the rooted, and the winners
are the professionals, people so depraved that they would actually

company ``whose only reason for being is to make life good,''
writes Michael Hopkins. Eichen's Rokenbok Toy Co. operates north of
San Diego employing lots of north of San Diego values, such as a
casual dress codes and rampant collegiality. Mellow, man. Then flip

   Decrying limited commercial-network coverage of this summer's
political conventions, the editors launch their Page 9 editorial by
recalling the 1934 Communications Act, which granted broadcasters
use of the airwaves on the promise that they serve the ``public
interest, convenience and necessity.'' Nostalgia has its place -
that pony left the barn a long time ago {ndash} yet the point
remains: By abandoning their civic obligation to cover, uh, civics,
the nets have become negligent corporate citizens. Meanwhile, the
cover story profiles Bill Daley, recently drafted to reorient Al
Gore's campaign for the general election. We'll pause here for
network newscast devotees to ask ``who?'' Glad you asked. The
youngest child of legendary Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley, he's
``the most creative operative in the Democratic Party,'' says the
magazine.

<P>
   The recent flap over (beginitalic)Family Circus(enditalic) and
pool safety serves as a reminder that Bil Keane's seemingly gentle
comic strip long has been a hotbed of controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The strip in question - depicting the strip's daddy, Bill,
paying scant attention to his pool-paddling brood - caused a
firestorm of protest from local firefighters, and Keane quickly
altered the strip for poster reprint by adding a cautionary
caption.
</P>
<P>
   But the scuttlebutt echoed strongly the impassioned reaction to
the (beginitalic)Family Circus (enditalic)compilation
(beginitalic)What Does This Say?
</P>
<P>
   (enditalic)Reader emotion flowed onto the reader-input screens
of Amazon.com and was so memorable that the online retailer
included the typed tussle in recent anniversary celebration of
wacky reader exchanges. The collective manifesto - which admittedly
may be tongue in cheek - is still archived in full on the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keane is a genius,'' writes one correspondent.
``(beginitalic)Family Circus (enditalic)is a deconstruction of
modern suburban emasculation - sort of like the movie
(beginitalic)American Beauty(enditalic) but far more clever. I
offer my apologies to Mr. Keane. I am simply not good enough to be
in the presence of his work. I will now poke out my eyes with my
mother's brooches, such is the shame I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Another correspondent calls the strip ``the cartoon equivalent
of the faceless black monolith in the first segment of
(beginitalic)2001: A Space Odyssey (enditalic)that begets
technology and civilization among a race of ape-men. {ellipsis}
These original masterpieces have lost none of their stark,
visionary power.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet another digs for the political subtext ruling the world of
Billy, Dolly, Jeffy, et al.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nihilists and existentialists, look out!'' the writer writes.
``The profound truths conveyed through the heartwarming, hilarious
predicaments of four whimsical moppets and their parents will rock
your world view! Secular humanists, manicurists, clergy and lawyers
alike will (laugh) out loud or --at least chuckle in
self-realization at the sheer depth of humanity presented in Bil
Keane's tours de force. Belongs on the shelf with Kant, the Bible,
Nietzsche, Jung {ellipsis} to delve into again and again. Sure to
age gracefully and not to be missed.''
</P>
<P>
   One critic writes that though (beginitalic)Family Circus
(enditalic)''was once viewed as a lighthearted romp through
middle-class society. Deeper study might reveal the Marxist
overtones of the comic. This is exactly the kind of message that we
want the youth of America to absorb. We want young girls to realize
that even after many years it's never too late for a new hairstyle.
Change and revolution is coming, and Bil Keane is leading the
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Keane, reached at his Paradise Valley home, said he seldom
objects to (beginitalic)Family Circus (enditalic)satire.
</P>
<P>
   ``They select the (beginitalic)Family Circus (enditalic)because
of its innocence and its (depiction of ) American family life and
apple pie and motherhood,'' he said. ``It's the perfect target.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that 188 million people read it daily gives it an
armor that they hardly can pierce, and to me it's always flattering
they feel that the feature is known enough for them to take
potshots.''

   CO-OP SNOOP
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am a member of my co-op board. A prospective buyer's tax
return showed that she had deducted the entire cost of her Ivy
League MBA, a clear violation of the tax laws. I am appalled by her
deceit and wonder if it is a legitimate reason to reject her
application. Should I report her to the IRS?
</P>
<P>
   _ Anonymous, New York
</P>
<P>
   A: You should neither reject her application nor report her to
the IRS, at least not based on what you've described. You have no
idea if her deduction was deceitful or an honest error _ or if
indeed it was an error at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``If education or training is undertaken to qualify you for a
new profession, it is not deductible,'' says Curtis Arluck, a
partner in the accounting firm Weikart Associates. ``But if it's
further training within your field, it may be deductible.'' Either
way, the case should be settled by the IRS, not a co-op board. And
the IRS has every opportunity to do so if it wishes: the woman
declared her tuition on her tax forms, after all.
</P>
<P>
   While you have a legitimate interest in assessing a prospective
buyer's financial strength, you should use each applicant's private
information for that purpose only, not to snare tax cheats or
otherwise clean up Dodge City. Unless you learn that an applicant
is engaged in a serious and ongoing crime _ a string of grisly
murders, say, or touring with 'N Sync _ then you must respect her
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When my eyeglasses needed a new screw to hold the lens in
place, I went to the village optician. He fixed them and declined
my offer to pay. Ten minutes later, I noticed the lenses were
cracked. I presume he just made them too tight. I feel he should
pay at least part of the replacement cost, but since I did not pay
for his services, am I wrong to hold him responsible?
</P>
<P>
   _ Peter Rogavin, Westchester, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A: If the optician broke your glasses, he should replace the
lenses. He might argue that his refusal to accept payment
transformed your encounter from a commercial transaction to a
favor, and you can't hold someone accountable for a favor. He'd be
wrong to think so. This was a professional service _ probably
rendered with the thought of your repeat business _ and he should
stand behind his work. Some opticians who do free repairs post an
at-your-own-risk sign, but if that's his policy he should make it
clear before starting the job.
</P>
<P>
   Why not go by the shop and talk to him? However, if he declines
to cover your cost, don't be surprised, and if he tries to put you
in pink rhinestone harlequin frames, don't be persuaded.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When newsstand dealers discard unsold papers, they tear off
part of the front page for reimbursement, bundle the papers and
place them by the garbage, presumably for recycling. One day I
undid the bundle and helped myself to a paper. The newsstand
attendant told me to put it back. I said that it was garbage and
that I'd return after he left and take it. Was I wrong?
</P>
<P>
   _ N.R., New York
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. No matter how you figure it, you are stealing from
someone _ the publisher, the news dealer or the recycler. Further,
the continued existence of newspapers, something you seem to value,
depends on readers buying a paper. Why not try that? Incidentally,
all of us who have written for a paper have heard it called
``garbage,'' but it still hurts our feelings.

VERIZON, UNIONS SAID MAKING SLOW PROGRESS IN TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As pickets rallied Monday, Verizon Communications and its unions
moved closer to resolving a two-day-old strike over job security
and the unionization of wireless employees.
</P>
<P>
   The walkout by 85,000 telephone customer service representatives
and technicians left millions of consumers in a dozen Eastern
states with delays in directory assistance and repairs.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, 2,500 customers lost telephone service in the
Bronx, and an additional 600 reported no service in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the company confirmed that five incidents of
vandalism occurred at Verizon facilities in New York City, but it
was not clear Monday whether the damage was related to the strike.
A company spokesman said several cables were cut.
</P>
<P>
   The Communications Workers of America and the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers staged mass picketing and rallies
at dozens of corporate sites on the East Coast that each drew
between 350 and 1,200 telephone operators, customer service
representatives, and technicians.
</P>
<P>
   Union workers struck Verizon, which was created by the merger of
Bell Atlantic and GTE, at 12 a.m. Sunday, affecting some 25 million
consumers from Maine to Virginia. Talks between management and
labor ended at 1 a.m. Monday, and resumed seven hours later, a
company official said.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides said considerable progress had been made since the
parties reached an impasse over labor groups' push to unionize
3,500 nonunion workers at Verizon Wireless, a subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   The CWA and IBEW are seeking contract language that would allow
them to use card check neutrality agreements. Under such a plan,
workers at the wireless unit would automatically gain bargaining
rights after a majority sign union cards. This method bypasses
union elections, which can be appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Other issues on the table include outsourcing and the transfer
of technical and customer service jobs from the East to
right-to-work cities in the South, where union representation is
not as high.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are finding the talks to be productive, and we are
encouraged,'' Verizon spokesman Steve Marcus said. ``Although we
still have to work through some serious issues, we are hopeful that
we will be able to resolve these issues and reach an agreement on a
contract.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The gap has definitely closed,'' noted Steve Early, an
international representative for the CWA in New England. ``The
company made an improved offer to try and settle outstanding issues
involving 42 union technicians at Verizon Wireless in New York, and
details for card check neutrality are being hammered out.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, negotiators broke into small groups and began working on
the renewal of a contract for 42 wireless technicians in New York
who are represented by the IBEW. The workers are the only unionized
members in the company's fast-growing wireless division.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials have complained that wireless workers earn less
and receive a smaller benefits package than their unionized
colleagues in the company's traditional wireline division.
</P>
<P>
   Details pertaining to the outsourcing of work involving the
installation of high-speed digital subscriber lines in Pennsylvania
and New York have not yet been finalized. However, negotiators
Monday were trying to determine whether the company would use
independent contractors or a separate unit of lower-paid union
members to install DSL service lines. The latter would be employees
of Bell Atlantic Communications Systems Inc., a subsidiary, and
would work under a different contract.
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, meanwhile, the Court of Common Pleas issued an
injunction restricting the number of pickets at any company
entrance to four. A similar injunction was issued in Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported more than 350 people, dressed in
black T-shirts stamped with a cobra and the words ``Will strike if
provoked'' rallied at Verizon Communications headquarters in
Providence, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   And in Andover, Mass., some 500 pickets rallied outside a
Verizon office park at 6:30 a.m. The strikers, who wore red and
white placards with the words ``CWA ON STRIKE,'' said they were
concerned that Verizon could move some New England jobs to other
regions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wages are only a part of this,'' said Michelle McCormack, a
32-year-old customer service representative and mother of three.
``We're out here because we want job security.''

   TESTING AT THE TAP
</P>
<P>
   If you want to find out what's in your tap water, the place to
start is your local public water utility. Ask for the most recent
``Consumer Confidence Report.'' This report should tell you where
your water comes from _ whether it's surface water (from rivers or
lakes), groundwater (from underground rivers or streams) or some
mixture. It will also tell you whether your water exceeds the
limits for any of the 80 contaminants regulated by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency. You should also ask for a printout
of the levels of all 80 contaminants.
</P>
<P>
   If you get your water from a well, you'll need to get it tested.
Call the EPA Safe Drinking Water Hotline
</P>
<P>
   (1-800-426-4791) for information on how to obtain a list of
certified labs that will test for lead, turbidity, arsenic,
parasites and other contaminants.
</P>
<P>
   CONSIDERING A WATER FILTER?
</P>
<P>
   Water filters vary widely in what they can remove, how much they
cost and how expensive they are to maintain.
</P>
<P>
   Varieties include tabletop carafes that require frequent
refilling; faucet-mounted units that can be switched from a filter
to a nonfilter position; and under-the-sink units that supply
filtered cold water from a separate spigot or the main faucet.
</P>
<P>
   Prices range from $20 to $500; replacement filters can add up to
$150 a year. Before shopping, determine what you want to remove
from your tap water and the degree of convenience you desire.
</P>
<P>
   A carafe uses a carbon filter that improves flavor and removes
chlorine, DBPs and lead, but not microorganisms. Carafes are
inexpensive and handy for use in bathrooms and bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Faucet-mounted, countertop and under-the sink filters use more
sophisticated carbon filters, some of which can remove
cryptosporidium bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   There are also rather expensive countertop, under-sink or
basement systems that cleanse water by a process called reverse
osmosis. It works slowly and wastes a lot of water; it also removes
beneficial fluoride from the water.
</P>
<P>
   NSF International is an independent organization that tests
water filters and bottled water for purity. An NSF publication
titled ``Water Wise: The Consumer's Guide to Safe Drinking Water,''
which lists all the water filtration units tested by NSF and what
they remove, is available for $5. Write to NSF International, 789
N. Dixboro Road, P.O. Box 130140, Ann Arbor, MI 48113-0140, or call

 &HT;    Are you getting enough water?
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Where Atlantan Carol Hoban goes, so goes her big glass. Or
sometimes it's a big bottle. But either way Hoban always knows
where her next drink of water is coming from.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most Atlantans, Hoban drinks more than the recommended
minimum of eight glasses of water each day. ``It's something I've
been doing for 10 years, '' said Hoban, 33, an epidemiologist. ``If
I don't get enough water, I can tell. I feel thirsty and
sluggish.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three-quarters of Atlantans questioned in a recent survey
said they know they are supposed to drink at least eight 8-ounce
servings of water each day. But only 35 percent reported they
actually do, according to the survey, conducted by Yankelovich
Partners for the Rockefeller University in New York and the
International Bottled Water Association.
</P>
<P>
   The survey encompassed 2,818 Americans, 201 from Atlanta. And
Atlanta's numbers track the national numbers almost exactly.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the bottled water industry has an interest in
encouraging people to drink more water. But the truth is, people
need to.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, most of us need more than eight glasses a day. Kathleen
Zelman, a Marietta, Ga., nutritionist and local spokeswoman for the
American Dietetic Association, said eight is the minimum in a range
up to 12.
</P>
<P>
   A good guideline is to divide your weight in half and then
consume that many ounces of water each day. So a 128-pound person
needs 64 ounces, but a 160-pound person needs 80 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons we need water are many. After oxygen, water is the
human body's most important need. Our bodies consist largely of
water (estimates range from 50 percent to 70 percent), and water
plays a role in nearly every major bodily function.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, water is essential to regulating our body
temperature, which is especially important in hot, humid weather.
``Any time you are exposed to high temperatures, you need to keep
replenishing with water to keep the body temperature normal,''
Zelman said. ``That's your body's way to cool down.''
</P>
<P>
   Water also plays a key role in carrying nutrients and oxygen to
cells, removing waste, cushioning joints and protecting organs and
tissues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without proper hydration, the body is exposed to a variety of
health risks,'' said Barbara Levine, director of the nutrition
department at Rockefeller University. ``Long-term, more severe
dehydration poses serious problems that dangerously affect blood
pressure, circulation, digestion, kidney function and nearly all
body functions.''
</P>
<P>
   Mild dehydration can cause sluggishness, dry and itchy skin,
headaches, indigestion, constipation and the trigger to drink _
thirst. ``You shouldn't wait until you are thirsty,'' said Zelman.
``That's a sign that dehydration has already set in.''
</P>
<P>
   Water isn't the only liquid that can hydrate our bodies. But
while caffeinated beverages like coffee, tea and soda and alcoholic
drinks may wet the mouth, they actually cause the body to lose
water. The Yankelovich survey showed Atlantans drink more of these
beverages (6.8 servings a day) than they do water (6.2 servings.)
</P>
<P>
   Folks would be better off trading caffeine and alcohol for
water, juice, milk and carbonated sodas without caffeine. And some
foods with high water content, such as lettuce and tomatoes, can
aid in hydration.
</P>
<P>
   Sports drinks also can help. ``They have minerals in them and
some flavor, which for some people simply helps them ingest as much
fluid as they need. Of course some also have sugar,'' Zelman said.
</P>
<P>
   And contrary to popular belief, only those who've participated
in strenuous marathon-type activity really need to replace sodium
and minerals with a sports drink. ``If you've just been batting the
tennis ball around, water will do it. But if a sports drink will
help you drink a lot, then go for it,'' Zelman said.
</P>
<P>
   Mindy Perilla, 29, a coordinator of international health
programs, said she likes to add lemon juice, lime juice or
cranberry juice to her water for a little flavor. ``I'm not an
athlete, I just like to drink water,'' said Perilla, who consumes
two to three liters a day. ``People notice it. My parents say they
don't know how I can drink so much. But I have fewer headaches and
muscle aches and it just makes me feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   FOODS THAT HELP HYDRATE
</P>
<P>
   Water should be your key source for the necessary fluids to keep
your body cool and functioning properly. But there are
</P>
<P>
   Some foods have a high water content. Try adding these to your
diet to help meet your body's water requirement.

 &HT;    Medicare HMO closings have many scrambling
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I want my HMO.
</P>
<P>
   That's the cry of thousands of Georgia senior citizens notified
in the past month that their Medicare HMOs are going out of
business _ taking with them such benefits as cheap prescription
drugs, annual exams, hearing tests and other services not normally
included in the traditional Medicare plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has become a national crisis within the past three
years,'' said Susan Pisano, spokeswoman for the American
Association of Health Plans. ``But it's simply not financially
feasible for these HMOs to stay in business.''
</P>
<P>
   Pay attention. Although Medicare HMOs serve an older population,
their demise could be a harbinger of larger problems for managed
care. Right now, 1.4 million Georgians depend on HMOs, and all of
these managed care companies _ whether they are Medicare, Medicaid
or private plans _ are struggling to contain rising medical and
prescription drug costs.
</P>
<P>
   So why are Medicare HMOs having such financial woes? And what
can you do if yours goes out of business?
</P>
<P>
   Insurers that offer Medicare HMOs say the key problem is
inadequate federal payment for benefits. Under a traditional plan,
Medicare is a fee-for-service plan, with the federal government
paying a set amount for services or treatment rendered. But under
an HMO, the federal government contracts with an insurer to provide
all treatment of its older citizens for a monthly, per-head, capped
amount. In order for the insurer to stay in business, that amount
has to at least cover the cost of treatment and prescriptions used
by the members enrolled in the HMO.
</P>
<P>
   But insurers say the federal compensation is not covering their
costs, making Medicare HMOs unprofitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most plans in most locales are getting a 2 percent increase in
payment (annually) when their expenses are going up 7 to 8 percent
a year,'' Pisano said. ``It doesn't take that long for that to
become unsustainable.''
</P>
<P>
   A General Accounting Office report, released in July, said there
is enough money for basic services, but not enough for all the
perks that patients love. It recommended Congress figure out
exactly what the HMOs should cover and adjust funding accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, three out of five insurers offering Medicare
HMOs in Georgia have announced they are pulling out, including
Aetna US Healthcare, Cigna HealthCare and UnitedHealthcare. And
that means about 20,000 seniors _ almost half of those enrolled in
Medicare HMOs in Georgia_ have been notified their plans will not
exist after Dec. 31, according to the Georgia Insurance
Commissioner's Office.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, doctors also have been notified. And many
are canceling their contracts with the HMOs now, leaving thousands
of patients scrambling to find new doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Newman, 69, joined Cigna's Medicare HMO last year, and
was thrilled with it. The plan paid for his treatment for prostate
cancer and paid for medication and care related to his high blood
pressure and kidney problems. But in June, he was notified that
Cigna was pulling out of the market. And then his primary care
physician canceled his contract. That meant Newman had to pick from
a list of three new doctors he didn't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was left holding the bag,'' Newman said. ``This is a dirty
trick.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Elizabeth deGive, a Rockdale County internist, is seeing
similar problems among the 400 patients in her practice recently
dropped by Cigna. ``Quite honestly, the patients who would choose
an HMO are often people who have high medical costs _ numerous
prescriptions and visits _ and they're trying to get by on a fixed
income,'' deGive said. ``They tend to be our sicker, more
complicated cases.''
</P>
<P>
   So many seniors were upset and confused about the changes, a
handful of Medicare representatives and physicians held a series of
meetings at the Newton County Library in Covington last week to
explain their options. Almost 200 people showed up for the first
meeting _ with some having to be turned away because of fire laws.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the seniors who have lost their HMO have the option of
joining another one in their county. According to the Insurance
Commissioner's Office, only 2,303 _ in Newton and Spalding counties
_ would have to travel over county lines to rejoin an HMO.
</P>
<P>
   Two companies _ Blue Cross &AMP; Blue Shield of Georgia and Kaiser
Permanente of Georgia _ still offer Medicare HMOs. But even they
acknowledge that the future is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have tried to construct a business plan for 2001 that
allows us to remain in the Medicare business,'' said Dick Shirk,
Blue Cross &AMP; Blue Shield of Georgia's chief executive officer.
``But if we cannot get the funding to maintain this, we're going to
have to rethink beyond 2001.''
</P>
<P>
   So what should you do if you've just learned of your HMO's
demise? Signing up with another HMO can be a solid tactic if your
doctor is part of the new network. Seniors can also decide to
return to the traditional Medicare plan.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a good idea to purchase a supplemental plan to cover
the holes in the traditional plan.
</P>
<P>
   You can also learn more about Medicare by contacting:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Georgia Insurance Commissioner's Office, which offers a
help line at 404-656-2070, which is open 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. weekdays.
It also offers a free brochure called ``Medicare and You.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Health Care Financing Administration, which manages
Medicare and offers a help line at 1-800-633-4227 from 8 a.m. to
4:30 a.m. weekdays or you can get tips from www.hcfa.gov.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Your current HMO, even if it's going out of business. Not only
are there important deadlines that indicate how fast you need to
change to another HMO or to the traditional Medicare plan, but the
HMO should also offer packets of information by October explaining
your options.

 &HT;    ABC News chief under spotlight in New Yorker
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a fascinating New Yorker ($3) profile, Jane Mayer focuses on
ABC News President David Westin and his crusade to revive network
news. So far, Westin's claim to fame is his decision to send
Leonardo DiCaprio to interview Bill Clinton. Longtime news staffers
complain that Westin's concern about offending top executives at
Disney, the network's parent company, has resulted in ``an
atmosphere of self-censorship and timidity.'' Adding to the
discontent are Westin's close ties to Diane Sawyer and his marriage
to Sherrie Rollins, former public relations executive at ABC and
ex-wife of political adviser Ed Rollins.

   &QR;  Tiger beat: Any golfer who played like Tiger Woods did in the
1997 Masters wouldn't have changed a thing _ not even his
underwear. But, as Time ($3.50) notes in its cover story on Woods,
the best golfer in the world decided that he needed to revamp his
swing completely. The gamble paid off and Woods went on to win the
British Open by a record margin. He also reinvented his private
life, Time reports, by dumping his caddie, his agent and his lawyer
and reshaping his image. The picture of Woods as a somewhat aloof
racial pioneer in the early Nike ads has been replaced with lighter
TV spots showing him juggling a golf ball on a wedge and conducting
classes on how to be Tiger Woods.

   &QR;  Double issue: Teen People ($3.99) does a flip in its September
issue, with a regular cover about hot summer concerts and a back
cover shot of Serena Williams introducing a special section on the
Olympics. Featured athletes include soccer great Mia Hamm, track
star Marion Jones and weightlifter Cheryl Haworth of Savannah.
Already the holder of all U.S. records for her weight and gender
class, Haworth, 17, is favored to win a medal in Sydney. The
270-pound athlete also encourages girls to overcome the stereotype
that they must be pencil-thin to succeed.

<P>
   &QR;  Politics then and now: Newsweek ($3.50) wraps up the
Republican convention neatly in 10 pages, then devotes 12 pages to
Newsweek editor Evan Thomas' biography ``Robert Kennedy: His
Life.'' In this excerpt, Thomas describes how the multifaceted
politician matured during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. ``He
blended high moralism and shifty pragmatism in a peculiarly
Kennedyesque way to edge the United States and the Soviet Union
back from the abyss,'' Thomas writes.

<P>
   &QR;  Leaving (late) on a jet plane: In a cover story on runway
rage, U.S. News &AMP; World Report ($3.50) looks at the reasons behind
the long lines and lengthy delays at the nation's airports.
Basically, the reporters conclude, there are too many planes and an
outdated air traffic control system that would cost $30 billion to
modernize. Other factors include lack of airport expansion and
labor squabbles. As a result, the number of verbal and physical
attacks on flight attendants is soaring.

&HT;     IMPACT OF LIEBERMAN'S RELIGION ON RACE COULD BE NIL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By MARK HELM and JUDY HOLLAND  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The religion of Sen. Joseph Lieberman, who next
week will become the nation's first Jewish vice presidential
nominee of a major political party, may have little or no impact on
the outcome of the election, some experts said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore will announce his selection of the
Orthodox Jewish senator from Connecticut as his running mate
Tuesday in Nashville, Tenn. The senator told reporters he received
a call from Gore Monday morning offering him the second spot on the
Democratic ticket. The two men prayed together during their phone
conversation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a Gallup Poll of 1,000 likely voters taken March 29 of last
year, 92 percent said they would vote for a well-qualified
candidate ``who happened to be Jewish.'' In 1937, in a similar
poll, only 42 percent said they would vote for a Jewish candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Religion has not been an issue in presidential politics since
John F. Kennedy became the first Catholic to win the presidency in
1960.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts divided on how voters will view a Jewish vice
presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Some said Lieberman will help Gore win over religious voters and
will raise the public's opinion of the ticket's moral standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes it harder for (George W.) Bush and (Dick) Cheney to
argue that there's one ticket that represents truthfulness and
morality and one that doesn't,'' said Norm Ornstein, a senior
fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington-based
think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Ornstein said that in past elections, Lieberman has received
significant support from Catholics and evangelical Protestants.
``Religious people respect other religious people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Pitney, a political science professor at Claremont McKenna
College in Claremont, Calif., predicted that Lieberman's religious
background will be a plus among members of the Christian Right. ``A
lot of people in the Christian Right would much rather have a
Jewish person of piety and integrity than a nominal Christian of
dubious character,'' Pitney said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Louis P. Sheldon, head of the Traditional Values
Coalition, a conservative lobbying group, also praised Gore's
choice while taking a dig at the vice president himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe Lieberman has an identifiable moral compass and would be
an improvement over the morally-challenged Al Gore,'' he said. ``By
selecting Lieberman, Gore is trying to distance himself from
Clinton and send a message to the American people that he
disapproved of Clinton's sexual antics.''
</P>
<P>
   But other observers questioned the impact of Lieberman's
religion on the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone can calculate the effect of having a Jew
on the ticket,'' Democratic National Chairman Ed Rendell said last
week. ``If Joe Leiberman were Episcopalian, it would be a slam
dunk.'' Rendell became Philadelphia's first Jewish mayor in 1992
and served until last year, when he took the party post.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic consultant David Axelrod, who also is Jewish, said
Lieberman could hurt Gore in the South and other conservative
states. But he added that Bush already has substantial leads in
those states.
</P>
<P>
   In the Midwest, where a number of states are too close to call,
Lieberman's religion is ``less of a problem,'' he said, adding,
``If you look at the swing states, starting with New Jersey to
Wisconsin, every one of them has elected a Jewish senator or
governor.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Gore's effort to distance himself from Clinton by
choosing Lieberman could end up helping a cause dear to the
president's heart: Hillary Rodham Clinton's quest to win New York's
U.S. Senate race against Long Island Republican Rep. Rick Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton needs the overwhelming support of New York's
Jewish vote if she hopes to win the race, but most polls show her
garnering only slightly more than half of it. However, Ornstein
said Lieberman's likely campaign stops in the state will be ``a big
plus for Hillary. It will excite a lot of Jewish voters, who
represent 10 percent of the electorate in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Jews have traditionally voted Democratic, and in the last
presidential election, Bill Clinton won some 75 percent of their
vote. However, their loyalty to the party cannot be taken for
granted.
</P>
<P>
   New York Republican Mayor Rudolph Giuliani was re-elected with
more than 70 percent of the Jewish vote in 1997, when he trounced a
liberal Jewish candidate, Ruth Messinger. In the 1992 Senate race,
Republican Alfonse D'Amato beat the popular Jewish state
attorney-general, Democrat Robert Abrams, and won a surprisingly
high 41 percent of the Jewish vote in the process.Lieberman has not
always voted according to the Democratic Party line. He once
sponsored a bill to set up experimental voucher programs, letting
parents use federal money to send their children to public or
private schools, including religious schools. Gore opposes such a
plan, saying it would undermine public education.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Lieberman backed education proposals that do not
include vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   He voted to expand tax-free education savings accounts to help
parents cover education expenses in all grades and at public and
private schools, including religious schools _ an idea promoted by
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   He has also spoken in favor of partially privatizing Social
</P>
<P>
   Security, as proposed by Bush and opposed by Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Monday that the most important thing Lieberman
brings to the Democratic ticket is integrity. Pitney said
Lieberman's reputation as a religious man of unquestioned morals
will help Gore distance himself from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe Lieberman represents a shot of anti-Clinton vaccine,''
Pitney said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, a longtime friend of Clinton, was the first Senate
Democrat to publicly criticize him on the Senate floor for his
behavior in the Lewinsky scandal. He called the president's
behavior ``immoral'' and his denials of wrongdoing ``intentional
and premeditated.'' In the end, however, Lieberman voted against
impeaching Clinton, saying he thought the president should be
censured instead.
</P>
<P>
   William F. Connelly., a political science professor at
Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Va., said Lieberman
cannot inoculate Gore against the reputation of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately Al Gore will stand or fall on the basis of his
close association with Clinton,'' Connelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, often called the moral conscience of the Senate,
strictly observes the Sabbath, from sundown Friday until sundown
Saturday, refusing to use a telephone or drive a car. He also won't
campaign on Saturdays, an observance that kept him from attending
his own state nominating convention in 1988, the year he was first
elected to the Senate.

THE `BOOK' ON LIEBERMAN: `MR. ETHICS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD HIGGINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lawrence Fuchs of Weston wrote ``the book'' on the political
behavior of American Jews.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday Fuchs, a veteran Democratic activist and Brandeis
professor, said he was surprised by Vice President Al Gore's choice
of US Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut as a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had asked me who'd be the first Jew on a national
ticket, I would have said a highly assimilated one, not an Orthodox
Jew,'' said Fuchs, who wrote ``The Political Behavior of American
Jews'' in 1956. ``Usually, you don't crack through with a seriously
religious person.''
</P>
<P>
   Jews and non-Jews from around the region Monday reacted
favorably to the choice of Lieberman, noting the political appeal
for Gore of a running mate with a reputation for moral rectitude
and high ethical standards.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, saw historical significance in the choice of
the nation's first Jewish vice presidential candidate _ coming as
it does on the 40th anniversary of the Democrats' nomination of
Kennedy, also in Los Angeles, who would become the nation's first
(and only) Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has transcendent meaning for the Jewish community,'' said
Barry Shrage of Newton, Mass., president of Combined Jewish
Philanthropies of Greater Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Perlmutter of Newton, author of ``Legacy of Hate,'' a
book on the history of anti-Semitism in America, said Gore's choice
shows that respect for religious diversity in America is growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm delighted for him and for the country,'' said Perlmutter,
the former director of the Jewish Community Relations Council of
Greater Boston. ``Who could have predicted just a few years ago
that they would take a Jew on a national ticket, and an an
observant one, but why not? Bush is running as a devout
Christian.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman and his wife, Hadassah, who grew up in Gardner, Mass.,
are Orthodox Jews who observe the Jewish Sabbath from sundown
Friday to sundown Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The senator has said that he won't campaign during that period
but will vote on legislation, attend important meetings or
otherwise do work that promotes ``the respect and protection of
human life and well-being.'' Gore staffers said Lieberman has an
apartment within walking distance of Capitol Hill so he can go to
work on the Sabbath without breaking the stricture against riding
in automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   Hadassah Frelich, his second wife, was born in Prague in 1948
and moved to Gardner when she was 3, according to a spokesman for
the senator. She graduated from Boston University in 1970 and has a
master's degree in health care administration.
</P>
<P>
   While many observers suggested that Lieberman's religion would
help Gore get a needed jolt of attention before next week's
Democratic convention, Fuchs, the Brandeis professor, urged
caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is a bid for the Jewish vote,'' said Fuchs,
noting that the great majority of America's more than 5 million
Jews already vote Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about the fact that Lieberman is Mr. Ethics, the
conscience of the Senate, a man whose morality and piety are
without compromise,'' said Fuchs, who was an aide to President John
F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing Lieberman, he said, was a way for Gore to ``declare his
independence from the more tawdry aspects of the Clinton
presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   However Shrage, the head of Combined Jewish Philanthropies, said
that it was hard to overplay the significance for American Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, it's a symbol of just what an amazing country America
has been for the Jewish people,'' said Shrage, a second-generation
American whose grandparents were born in Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   Shrage, who is an Orthodox Jew himself, said Lieberman
represents a stream of Orthodoxy that he called modern, centrist
Orthodoxy. He said that strain is associated with Yeshiva
University in New York and respects plurality, both within the
Jewish world and beyond.

 &HT;    Lowe's to quit selling products made with wood from endangered
forests
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA  &QC;  Lowe's Cos. plans to stop selling products from
endangered forests, starting with an immediate ban on wood from
areas of British Columbia, Canada
</P>
<P>
   Lowe's, the nation's second-largest home improvement retailer,
is expected to announce today a wood purchasing policy that
requires suppliers to prove their products come from well-managed
forests.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just about 2x4s and plywood. Even though a large
majority of our (wood products) is in building materials, this
policy has big implications for flooring, doors and anything else
made from wood,'' said Mark Kauffman, senior vice president of
merchandising for Lowe's.
</P>
<P>
   As global logging practices face increasing scrutiny, Lowe's
joins a growing group of wood buyers that wants to know where the
wood is coming from. Trees from endangered or ``old-growth''
forests typically end up in stores in the form of windows, tool
handles and cabinets, for example. Those products can be hard to
track because they go through so many manufacturers before landing
on shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe's said it will give preference to suppliers that hire
outside auditors to inspect forests for sustainable management
practices. The Wilkesboro, N.C.-based retailer wants its suppliers
to use harvesting standards set by the Forest Stewardship Council,
a non-governmental group in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   One year ago, Atlanta-based Home Depot launched a similar plan,
also endorsing the Forest Stewardship Council. With partners such
as the World Wildlife Fund and Greenpeace, the council is trying to
persuade companies and foresters around the world to agree on one
set of standards for forest conservation and management.
</P>
<P>
   Products that are certified under this plan end up in stores
with a label similar to the Good Housekeeping label.
</P>
<P>
   But certification is a highly complex endeavor. Although the
world's forests have vanished at a dramatic rate in recent decades,
little is known about the status of the remaining forests as a
whole. Most research has been restricted to individual countries.
</P>
<P>
   The World Resources Institute, a Washington-based policy
research group, is preparing a map of forests and the risks they
face. Home Depot, Lowe's and other companies endorsing the Forest
Stewardship Council will use that map to guide their purchasing
policies.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only Canada and a few other countries have been mapped.
In the meantime, the retailers are banning certain forests and wood
products that are widely recognized as being at risk. Home Depot,
for example, said last year it will phase out cedar, redwood and
lauan, unless they are certified to comply with environmental
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe's declared an immediate ban on products from the Great Bear
Rainforest of British Columbia. In the United States, Lowe's is
concentrating on logging in the Pacific Northwest and the
Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Regulations and dwindling resources in the Northwest have
shifted wood demand to the South in recent years. As the Southern
forest industry tries to keep up with demand for wood products,
pine plantations have popped up on former forest and farm land.
Environmentalists generally frown on tree farms because of the lack
of ecological diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Another contentious issue in the move toward certification is
competing schemes. Large forest products companies such as
Georgia-Pacific and International Paper have endorsed the
``Sustainable Forestry Initiative'' designed by the American Forest
and Paper Association, the industry's trade group.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines cover issues such as water protection,
clear-cutting, wildlife and ecosystem function, but opponents argue
that industry's standards are not independent.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot and Lowe's want suppliers to use the international
standards set by the Forest Stewardship Council. The American
Forest and Paper Association says its members are sticking to the
industry standards.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear how that will play out with the retailers' new
purchasing policies, but in the meantime Home Depot and Lowe's will
have to keep doing business with the forest giants. For one thing,
there isn't enough certified wood to feed demand.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, the Forest Stewardship Council has certified only 45
million acres of forests, or an area about the size of Georgia and
half of South Carolina. That's less than 1 percent of the world's
forests.
</P>
<P>
   That's expected to change with the recent push from retailers,
though.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get calls every week from Home Depot suppliers, wanting to
find out about certification,'' said Hank Cauley, executive
director of the Forest Stewardship Council in the U.S. ``Now, with
Lowe's on board, it's going to be a domino effect.''

A FRESH APPROACH FOR MTV
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3 stars 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Page through concert listings these days, and you'll notice
there are more pop bands from the '70s and '80s on the road than
current recording artists. Joining the fray is the Jackson Decker
Band, an '80s phenomenon that, we are repeatedly told in the
opening moments of MTV's new series ``Live Through This'' was
wildly ``influential'' on hip '90s groups.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the music we hear the band perform, that's a little
hard to believe _ their music is generic, anthemic rock that's out
of fashion in today's music climate. The show's title is cribbed
from the biggest album from Courtney Love's band Hole, which hardly
resembles the band here, but then again, this is MTV _ not
late-night Cinemax.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``Live Through This'' is an interesting concoction _
there are hints the show will examine the band's current
irrelevance as the series progresses. The series, about the band's
reunion tour _ to lure MTV viewers, the story has the band members
all bringing their wildly attractive children, all in their teens
or early 20s, along for the ride (on their own bus, without parents
to chaperone!). And the tour manager is the grumpy guitarist's
smart, centered son (Tom Lock), who must contend with his father's
abuse and his own lingering feelings for the lead singer's daughter
(Sarah Manninen).
</P>
<P>
   Despite the numerous soap-operatic angles _ will the lovestruck
kids reunite? Is the band's guitarist (David Nerman) as big a jerk
as he seems? Will the recovering alcoholic diva (Jennifer Dale)
sing? And shouldn't they have hammered out that last question
before even announcing the tour, let alone dragging in the media
for the first open rehearsal? _ it's a surprisingly reflective
series. It examines, albeit peripherally, how these musicians
didn't really grow up and how they didn't plan for the future,
which accounts for this tour _ part reliving their glory days and
part just another pathetic has-been act humping it on the road for
a much-needed payday.
</P>
<P>
   MTV, which has presented scads of original programming in the
past, declares that ``Live Through This'' is noteworthy because it
represents ``the channel's first-ever hour-long drama series''
(distinctions, always parsing out the slim distinctions). But it's
actually distinctive because it likely represents the first time
people older than 30 have been given significant air time on the
network (outside, of course, of Kurt Loder). One wonders what the
MTV demographic will make of all those fogeys crowding their sacred
screen; the show probably makes more sense on MTV's sister network
VH-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Live Through This'' is, almost characteristically, something
you'd never expect from MTV _ a show that's purposefully not hip.
Which, given the way MTV works, probably makes it all that much
cooler. &QL; 
_____ &QL;

COMMENTARY: HIGH NOON AT GORE GAP 
</HEADLINE>
   By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   My early years in journalism were spent searching for colorful
things to say about Joseph Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   I have here a list of the best and worst members of the
Connecticut state legislature circa 1978. Lieberman was sixth-best.
Most of the people who came in ahead of him are either dead or
lobbyists, so when it came to potential running mates from the
Nutmeg State, Al Gore pretty much got the pick of the litter.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut magazine compiled the list, but I was in charge of
the lively prose. This is the lead I came up with: ``Senate
Majority Leader Joseph Lieberman is a man who's given a whole new
meaning to the term `low key.''' In another profile, I noted that
the then 35-year-old Lieberman was one of those guys who look
middle-aged at 30, and would still look middle-aged at 80. He's
become fond of quoting that in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   This is one laid-back Democrat, a subtle mix of interesting and
boring that solves almost all the main problems facing Al Gore
except how to get anybody to listen to the convention speeches.
It's a perfect match. Gore can be stiff but not pompous. Lieberman
can be pompous but not stiff. And who else would qualify as a
compelling, thinking-outside-the-box choice without looking more
exciting than the top of the ticket?
</P>
<P>
   The running-mate-to-be seemed positively giddy Monday afternoon,
and giddy is not normally one of his adjectives. ``I can't think of
a place I'd rather be at this momentous time of my life than with
you, the working people of Connecticut,'' he told a convention of
the state AFL-CIO in Hartford. Then he launched into reminiscences
of Connecticut labor leaders of yore, the late Gov. Ella Grasso,
his parents and his salad days in the state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman won his first race when he was only 28, so the 10
years he spent as a state senator shaped him as a politician. It
was a peculiar time in Connecticut history. Every state legislature
has a moment when it gets golden. (Well, maybe not Alabama.) You
hit a stretch where the people who get elected seem unusually
smart, and the good-government tools like open meetings and public
hearings and full floor debates actually work the way they're
supposed to. Connecticut was golden like that in the 1970s, and the
result was a rather extraordinary level of bipartisanship that
seems to have marked Lieberman for life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a great deal of civility there. We had open caucuses
and the Democrats came into our caucus room to discuss tax
policy,'' said Lewis Rome, a lawyer who was Senate minority leader
at the time and calls the senator ``a moral force.'' (Rome, by the
way, finished first in that best-legislator poll.)
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's ability to rise above party politics is his biggest
strength as a legislator, and he probably couldn't have learned it
if he'd spent his formative years in the House of Representatives
of the 1990s. ``If he has any detractors in the Senate it's because
of his bipartisanship,'' said Sen. Charles Schumer of New York, who
describes Lieberman as ``almost a Gary Cooper type in the Senate.''
(Becoming the first Jewish candidate on a national ticket is nice.
But every male politician's fantasy is being called the Gary Cooper
of the Senate.)
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has been much more daring as a U.S. senator than he
was when he was younger. He used to have one of those careful,
work-your-way-up careers. He lost a bid to become lieutenant
governor, then ran for Congress in 1980. He was defeated by Larry
DeNardis, the current president of the University of New Haven, who
recalls that the campaign was so issue-oriented even the League of
Women Voters got tired of hearing them debate.
</P>
<P>
   He became attorney general and then made the first big, risky
move of his career in 1988 when he ran against Sen. Lowell Weicker.
``Before a big speech he'd drop down and do push-ups to get his
blood running,'' said Marla Romash, who was the campaign
communications director.
</P>
<P>
   This is an excellent potential bonding tool for the campaign, in
which Al Gore is known to do stomach crunches during long flights.
Perhaps instead of the traditional post-convention whistle-stop
tour, they could travel from one athletic field to another. In your
heart, you know they're fit.

SELECTION OF MODERATE TAKES BUSH CAMP UNAWARES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Republicans, caught off-guard by the selection of a
respected moderate as Vice President Al Gore's running mate,
lavished Senator Joseph I. Lieberman with praise Monday while
quietly admitting they would have preferred to compete against
someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to George W. Bush had hoped Gore would select a more
liberal figure, such as Senator John F. Kerry of Massachusetts, or
an unknown, such as Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, whose
records and personal histories would have been wide open to attack.
Of the five names floated before the announcement was made, only
Lieberman's caused concern among Bush officials and Republicans,
who said he would be virtually immune to criticism.
</P>
<P>
   And sure enough, as news of Lieberman's selection seeped out,
Republicans could not say enough kind things about the 58-year-old
orthodox Jew long viewed as a voice of morality in the US Senate.
Instead, the Bush campaign was left to condemn Gore himself, saying
the selection proved he was again reshaping his image for political
gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``His selection raises an interesting question about Al Gore's
commitments, and whether he truly believes some of the things he
has attacked George Bush for,'' said Bush communications director
Karen Hughes. In particular, she said, Lieberman has supported
school choice, otherwise known as vouchers, and Social Security
privatization _ positions more in line with the Bush platform than
that of the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The Lieberman decision appeared to throw a wrench in the Bush
strategy of tying Gore to President Clinton, adding to the ticket
the Democrat who first criticized Clinton during the Monica
Lewinsky scandal. Some Republicans said his presence might blunt
the impact of Bush's frequent promise to ``restore dignity to the
White House''; Scott Reed, the campaign adviser to Republican
presidential candidate Bob Dole in 1996, called the pick the
``smartest thing Gore's done since he won the nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're afraid to death of the moral problems and scandals of
the last eight years, and they're desperately trying to distance
themselves from the president,'' said Ron Kaufman, the
Massachusetts committeeman at the Republican National Committee.
``I think he's a good pick for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The only potential upside, one Republican said, is that the
selection indicates the Bush strategy is working. ``Lieberman is
the moral choice,'' one Senate Republican aide said. ``If there's a
political risk to it, it could send the message that George Bush is
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Governor Paul Cellucci of Massachusetts agreed. ``I suspect this
is a response to the success of the Republican convention,'' he
told reporters. ``It's pretty clear that Bush and Cheney have the
moral high ground here.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Republicans were hard pressed to find fault with any
facet of Lieberman's political or personal past, and as party
officials showered him with compliments it appeared their only hope
was to cast him as superior to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott considers Lieberman as ``among
our favorite Democrats,'' his spokesman, John Czwartacki' said.
Senator John S. McCain, the former rival of Bush, called Lieberman
``a worthy opponent and one who has respect on both sides of the
aisle.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Rudy Giuliani, the mayor of New York City, had praise for
the Connecticut senator, despite some speculation that his
appointment might gain Hillary Clinton support among that city's
important Jewish voters in her bid for the US Senate. Giuliani, who
withdrew from the race earlier this year, called Lieberman a
``very, very good man, a distinguished public servant.''
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't even much focus on Lieberman's oratorical style,
which is sometimes viewed as long-winded and dull. Connecticut
Governor John Rowland, a Republican, was one of the few who noted
that a matchup between Lieberman and his Republican opponent, Dick
Cheney, might be ``borderline boring.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Bush campaign used the occasion to argue
their candidate is above partisan attack. Unlike Gore, who released
a campaign advertisement against Cheney when he was chosen as
Bush's running mate, Bush officials said they had no plans to
pursue Lieberman in a negative way. Hughes, the communications
director, said Bush would treat the Connecticut senator ``with
respect...and I think the American people will notice the
contrast.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet there was a detectable air of disappointment among some Bush
supporters, many of whom had anticipated a vice presidential
candidate that would underscore the centrist nature of the Bush
campaign. Coming out of a Republican convention that stressed a
party unified around moderate positions, Bush hoped to appeal to
the political center; with Lieberman in the race, the Democratic
ticket will have a legitimate claim to the center as well. With
both sides fighting for moderate Democrats and Independents, the
selection will make it more difficult for Bush to cast Gore as a
solid liberal, several Republicans said.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a partisan standpoint, I'm disappointed,'' said
Representative Chris Shays, a Connecticut Republican who has known
Lieberman for 24 years. ``From a partisan standpoint, I would have
liked Senator Wellstone from Minnesota, and frankly, I think we
would have done very well if it had been Senator Kerry from
Massachusetts. The bottom line is, they chose the best candidate
they could choose.''

<P>
   UNION MILLS, N.C. _ In a major shift, timber companies have
stepped up logging operations in the South, where they face less
regulation than in the carefully monitored forests of the Pacific
Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Timber harvests in North Carolina, Tennessee and 11 other
Southern states increased by 50 percent from 1977 to 1997, from 6.8
billion cubic feet to 10.2 billion cubic feet, according to the
draft of a federal report, the Southern Resources Assessment. And
the trend has accelerated.
</P>
<P>
   Today, these Southern states _ from Virginia west through Texas
_ account for two-thirds of the 16 billion cubic feet of timber
harvested in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials said that almost all of the logging in the
South has been conducted responsibly. And they point to the very
forests now being cut as an example of that stewardship. Most
Southern forests, they said, were logged extensively as long as a
century ago and then cut again in successive logging cycles.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials and industry critics said the geographic shift
reflected, at least in part, the relative permissiveness of the
South, where most forests are in private, not public, hands, and
where logging is subject to few regulations.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Southern states have given free rein to logging on
private land, in contrast to the West, where state regulations are
stricter and where the abundance of federally owned forests means
that cutting must meet tight federal guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 70 percent of the 214 million acres of forest in the
South is held by private, nonindustrial owners, with an additional
20 percent owned by the forest products industry.
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, which is typical of Southern states, logging
on private land does not require state approval, and the state does
little to monitor the extent of timber harvests.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, federal officials and industry critics said, they
are seeing several troubling trends. For the first time, softwoods
like pine are being harvested faster than they can be replaced, and
projections in the Southern Resources Assessment suggested that the
more valuable hardwoods face a similar fate.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also pointed to a wider use of clear-cutting
operations that have laid bare vast tracts of forest.
</P>
<P>
   The relentless appetite for wood is being fed by an economy that
has produced a strong market for construction. Small towns like
Union Mills in western North Carolina have felt the boom in the
form of chip mills, like the one here owned by the Willamette
Industries Inc. of Portland, Ore., that grind enormous quantities
of wood into chips for making paper. More than 100 such mills have
sprung up across the South in the past 15 years, most since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Among those concerned about the shift in logging has been the
chief of the U.S. Forest Service, Mike Dombeck. Over the past 20
years, Dombeck said in a speech in June to a group of writers, a
huge surplus in the growth of timber over harvests in the South has
been all but eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is a question of basic sustainability,'' Dombeck
said. ``Harvest levels cannot exceed growth if forests are to
continue providing healthy fish and wildlife habitats, clean and
pure drinking water, and scenic beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   In the South, according to federal estimates, the growth deficit
is widest on land owned by the timber industry, which is about 20
percent of the forests and where removals in 1997 exceeded growth
by 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even in cases where forests are being replanted, as is
encouraged but rarely required in Southern states, it is often with
varieties like the fast-growing loblolly pine, a tree that is a
valuable commercial crop but one that biologists say is less likely
to promote animal habitat than the natural mixed forests.
</P>
<P>
   Timber industry officials said that the concerns are groundless
and that most logging was being conducted with an eye to the future
health not only of the forests but of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   They also acknowledged that in isolated cases, too much timber
has been cut too fast with too little thought about what replaced
the existing forest. But logging, they said, was the only way to
clear old, marginal timber and make way for healthier, newer trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a resource that's getting old, and its growth is
slowing, and the removals are increasing,'' said Bob Slocum,
executive vice president of the North Carolina Forestry
Association, an industry group. ``So you might have a period where
your removals are exceeding the growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Slocum said it is important to remember that the timber in the
South was extensively cut in the early 20th century and that it is
again time for harvesting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would argue that the more important issue is what happened
to the land after the harvest,'' he said. ``If it stays in
forestry, you're going to be OK. But if you pave it over, if you
replace it with a Home Depot or Wal-Mart, it's going to be lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry critics have cited the speed and scope of the logging
in the 13 states as their main concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic fact is that the Southeastern states were ill
prepared in the extreme for this incredible acceleration of timber
products,'' said Lark Hayes, who, as a senior lawyer for the
Southern Environmental Law Center has helped lead an effort to
impose greater controls over timber operations.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Missouri, under Gov. Mel Carnahan, imposed a
two-year moratorium on permits for chip mills. North Carolina is
also considering a moratorium, as part of a study ordered by Gov.
Jim Hunt.
</P>
<P>
   But it is in small communities like Union Mills where the newest
outrage can be heard. Local voices of opposition have brought a new
tone to environmental activism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a bunch of tree huggers, and we do want to use the
forest,'' Caroline J. Edwards, a seventh-generation North Carolina
resident who works as a soil scientist and forest management
consultant, said in the county seat town of Rutherfordton, N.C.,
not far from Union Mills. ``But we want to use it wisely.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Shannon A. Buckley, who as district procurement forester for
Willamette in western North Carolina has been at the center of the
local fight, offered a contrasting view that restrictions of
logging would be a blow to property rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all got to come from a willing seller,'' Buckley said of
the 300,000 tons of wood chips the mill could produce each year for
Willamette's expanding papermaking operations in Kentucky and
Tennessee. ``If the landowners don't want to sell the wood, it's
not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, groups like the Southeast Forest Project have tried
to pressure Vice President Al Gore, as an environmental advocate
and a native of Tennessee, to address concerns about chip mills and
Southern forests.
</P>
<P>
   In his comments, Dombeck has been careful to point out that the
widespread private ownership of Southern forests means that there
may be little the government can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not public lands I'm talking about, and we will not
try to regulate private forest land,'' Dombeck said in a recent
speech to members of the American Forest and Paper Association. ``I
challenge you, the world's foremost leaders in private forest
management, to show leadership on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Resources Assessment, which should be completed
next year, is expected to provide a more detailed look at Southern
forests. But one picture of the transformation can be gleaned from
periodic estimates by the Forest Service, which tries to gauge the
nation's timber supply.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, the studies show, the growth of timber stock in the
South exceeded harvests by 75 percent. But by 1997, the most recent
year for which statistics are available, the gap had dropped to
less than 5 percent, as harvests increased and growth declined.
</P>
<P>
   Among softwoods, the regionwide ratio changed from a large
surplus in 1977 to a deficit of 10 percent. Among hardwoods like
oak, hickory and poplar, the surplus has also dropped, prompting
researchers to warn that those woods will also fall into deficit
within the next decade if the current increase in logging remains
unchecked.
</P>
<P>
   And though 20 years ago, about 15 percent of the nation's timber
production came from national forests, mostly in the Northwest,
that figure has dipped below 5 percent, driven by a series of
federal decisions aimed at protecting the environment, and in
particular by the 1994 Northwest Forest Plan, crafted to meet a
court-ordered directive to save the endangered spotted owl.
</P>
<P>
   As across most of the country, logging in the South takes place
far from the cities and the Interstate.
</P>
<P>
   But the view from the air can offer a more vivid picture,
exposing one checkerboard after another, with patches of natural
forest interspersed by tracts razed to the bare earth, and by
others whose uniform green was a telltale sign of the planting of a
single variety of tree.
</P>
<P>
   On one recent afternoon, in the rugged terrain of the Cumberland
plateau, not far from Chattanooga in southeastern Tennessee, the
extent of the leveling was particularly vivid and appeared to
support the findings of one federal research project whose
conclusions suggested that in particular cases, the broad-brush
estimates might not reflect the severity of timber loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very clear that, more broadly, no one really yet knows
exactly what is going on,'' said Jonathan Evans, a biologist at the
University of the South who is director of the federal project,
which focused on impoverished, rural Grundy County and found that
the county lost 12 percent of its hardwood habitat from 1981 and
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Among particular points of dispute is whether the chip mills are
part of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Only 32 of the more than 150 chip mills existed before 1985, but
timber industry officials say the increase represents a step toward
efficiency, by making it possible to ship pulpwood to paper mills
as chips, instead of as logs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a demand out there that's going to be met,'' said
Slocum of the forestry association group. ``The demand is from
people for pulp and paper products, and the chip mills are going to
bring in the wood necessary to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   As a corollary benefit, foresters like Buckley say, the mills
provide a market for scrap wood that otherwise would have little
commercial value, thus encouraging an overhaul they say is
necessary to make way for healthier forests.
</P>
<P>
   But environmental groups and their allies see the mills more as
instruments of an assault on Southern forests whose only guide is
the corporate bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   The Dogwood Alliance, a group formed to the protect Southern
forests, has estimated that more than 1.2 million acres of forest a
year or about 1,500 square miles is needed to feed the chip mills
now in operation.
</P>
<P>
   In operations of that scale, the critics said, neither time nor
attention is given to selective logging measures aimed at promoting
natural habitat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I've always waited until the trees get big, and
only then do I saw them,'' said Rodney Robbins, 44, a
third-generation logger from Union Mills. ``But these timber
companies only see one way of doing things: They just want to go in
and mow everything down.''

BOMB SITES POSE HAZARDS FOR CENTURIES, NATIONAL ACADEMY REPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Tenn., N.M., Wash.)   By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Most of the sites where the federal government
built nuclear bombs will never be cleaned up enough to allow public
access to the land, and the plan for guarding sites that are
permanently contaminated is inadequate, the National Academy of
Sciences said Monday in a report.
</P>
<P>
   ``At many sites, radiological and nonradiological hazardous
wastes will remain, posing risks to humans and the environment for
tens or even hundreds of thousands of years,'' the report said.
``Complete elimination of unacceptable risks to humans and the
environment will not be achieved, now or in the foreseeable
future.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea that the production of nuclear weapons has produced
``national sacrifice zones,'' land that the public can never use
again, is not new. The term became common in environmental circles
in the late 1980s, when the United States began recognizing the
environmental legacy of the Manhattan Project, the effort during
World War II to develop atomic weapons, and the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   But the academy's report, which was commissioned by the
Department of Energy, goes a step further. It says that the
government can try to declare certain areas permanently off-limits,
but it does not have the technology, money and management
techniques to prevent the contamination from spreading.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some of the contaminants have already ``migrated''
outside plant boundaries and others will follow, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas M. Leschine, the chairman of the committee that wrote the
report, said site managers could use barbed wire and post guards at
the sites.
</P>
<P>
   But Leschine, an associate professor in the School of Marine
Affairs at the University of Washington, added: ``There's no
assurance that we can maintain any of that control. It's one thing
to put a fence up around something, but it's really something else
to maintain it in perpetuity.''
</P>
<P>
   Controls on the use of some of the land are already breaking
down, the report said. For example, in the early 1990s, the
Department of Energy sold land near its Oak Ridge Reservation in
Tennessee for use as a golf course, stipulating that the
groundwater was contaminated and was not to be used. ``Within a few
years, however, DOE discovered that a well was being drilled to
irrigate the golf course,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Leschine said the committee had found another case in which the
Department of Energy had posted ``no fishing'' signs at a creek
near Oak Ridge because of radiation contamination in the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``The signs all got stolen, because the local high school kids
thought they were nice things to have,'' he said. ``Then there were
months of protracted battles between the local authorities and the
Department of Energy, over whose responsibility it was to replace
the signs.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Department of Energy, Gerald G. Boyd, the deputy
assistant secretary for science and technology, said his agency
established a long-term stewardship office a year ago to cope with
the problem, with about a dozen people working with engineers and
planners at the various sites. The office was established soon
after the department requested the study from the National Academy
of Sciences, Boyd said.
</P>
<P>
   He compared his operation to a highway department that replaced
stop signs stolen from street corners, thefts that might cause
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to put plans in place so we have a way to make sure
that it doesn't happen, or if it does happen, we correct it,'' Boyd
said. ``That's the kind of planning we have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The department has accelerated efforts to clean up the sites,
reduce the costs involved and minimize risks to surrounding
communities, but a perfect cleanup is not possible, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As an example of the breakdown of control, Leschine cited the
fire that endangered the Los Alamos National Laboratory, near
Albuquerque, N.M., in May. The fire set the stage for mudslides in
the coming rainy season that could contaminate the Rio Grande with
radioactive and chemical toxins from the weapons laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   But the cause of the blaze was not natural or malicious; the
fire was set by another government agency as part of its
land-management efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that no plan written now to minimize the spread
of uncontained wastes would suffice over the tens, hundreds or even
thousands of years that some of the contaminants would remain
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   It urged the department to assume that engineered barriers like
concrete and steel would eventually fail, and that most of what was
known about the behavior of contaminants in air, soil or water
might ``eventually be proven wrong.'' The department needs a
long-term program that ``actively seeks out and applies new
knowledge,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   It recommended that clean-up efforts be left to future
generations at sites with low risks, or where technology might be
developed in the future that would make the job more practical, and
that priority should be given to sites where a delay would allow
contamination to spread.
</P>
<P>
   But it also said that too little information was available about
most sites to be able to decide which category to put them in.
</P>
<P>
   The report identified 144 sites where the department and its
predecessors, notably the Atomic Energy Commission, processed
nuclear materials, and it said that 109 of them would not be
cleaned up enough for unrestricted release, because of insufficient
money, technical skill or political will to do the job.

AN ARTIST WHO TRAVELS WITH YOU (ON TAPE, THAT IS) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SARAH BOXER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ I first heard the voice, an insinuating, whispering
voice in my head, in Switzerland. Inside the new Kunstmuseum in
Lucerne, in the middle of an exhibition called ``Mixing Memory and
Desire,'' somewhere between Joseph Reinhardt's late-18th-century
paintings of Swiss peasants and a maze of 21st-century installation
art, I heard it. I had climbed into a black-curtained booth, a
theater in miniature called ``Playhouse,'' and had sat down to
watch a singer projected on a tiny stage. I put on the headphones
that were waiting on the chair.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly a woman whispered in my ear, ``Sorry I'm late.'' I
wheeled around to see who had invaded the booth. No one was there.
The voice was in the headphones. As the singer onstage sang, the
voice kept whispering next to me _ something about the singer, the
song, a box under my seat, a gun, a crime to be committed. Then she
left. I looked under my seat. Nothing was there. I left the booth
and put the voice out of my mind.
</P>
<P>
   But the voice followed me to London. I was wandering around the
Tate Modern and had almost finished seeing an exhibition of
installation art, ``Between Cinema and a Hard Place.'' People were
standing around watching a miniature movie in a puppet-size
theater. They were motioning to their friends, ``You've got to see
this.'' What was the big deal? I picked up some headphones. ``The
Muriel Lake Incident'' was playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there any popcorn left?'' a familiar voice whispered in my
ear. Soon I could hear a woman next to me munching popcorn, quietly
but audibly. How rude! I looked over. No one was there. The whisper
started again: ``This isn't the film I thought it was. I thought it
was supposed to be directed by Orson Welles.'' The voice
disappeared, and shots rang out. The people next to me jumped, then
smiled sheepishly at their friends.
</P>
<P>
   The voice belonged to Janet Cardiff, an artist from Lethbridge,
Ontario, and it had me snared. When I learned that the voice could
be heard in Whitechapel, the East London neighborhood where Jack
the Ripper did his dirty work, I went. At the Whitechapel Library I
exchanged my credit card for ``The Missing Voice (Case Study B)'':
a pair of headphones, a Discman and a map of the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The whispering voice ordered me to the back of the library. I
went. I heard the rustling of newspapers. Was it real or was it
Memorex? The voice pushed me into a corner and had me scanning the
third shelf for a book by Reginald Hill. It was there. I pulled it
down. The voice read a passage on page 88: ``She set off at a brisk
pace.'' Then the voice inside my head said calmly but firmly: ``I
want you to walk with me. There are things I want to show you.''
</P>
<P>
   We went up the stairs together, and she pointed out the peeling
ceiling. She confided in me: ``I started these recordings as a way
to remember, to make things more real.'' I understood. She led me
out of the library and onto the street and treated me as an old
friend. ``I sometimes follow men late at night,'' she told me. ``It
makes me feel safe.'' That was eerie. I used to do that, too _ find
``a secret guardian angel'' on the street. ``I have red hair,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She was my guardian angel in Whitechapel. When it was time to
cross the street, she reminded me to look both ways. This was
London, after all, and Americans never know which way cars are
going. As we gazed at the words ``Look left'' and then ``Look
right'' painted in the gutter, she said, ``I'm glad they write that
on the streets for people like me.'' But she was an odd guide. She
kept imagining strange men about to commit crimes. And she kept
pointing out banana peels on the sidewalk that just weren't there.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to hear her whisper. On the tape there was Caribbean
drumming. In the street jackhammers were pounding. And there she
was, oblivious, telling a story about a man who spent 20 years
looking for the woman he loved. He played the violin. She seemed to
give careful directions, but I couldn't keep pace with her
footsteps, tapping faintly right beside me on the sidewalk. I was
having trouble navigating.
</P>
<P>
   The Pakistani restaurants were closed. It was Saturday. Only the
workmen with their jackhammers were out. I walked blocks in the
wrong direction, stretching my imagination to make myself think
that I was actually seeing what she was pointing out. Finally, I
reoriented myself at the Jesus Christ Spitalfields Church.
</P>
<P>
   As I looked at the brick buildings with clay chimneys and white
lintels, she told me to to head toward a red-on-orange sign that
said, ``Eat Drink Restaurant.'' At last I found it. At the moment
of my navigational triumph, she told a spooky story from her
childhood. She had found a man's body hanging from the neck. It
turned out to be her father's suit, hanging out to dry. A real man
walked by us yakking into his cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a row of men marching toward me,'' she whispered as
we made our way down a narrow alley. ``They have pointy hats and
striped beards.'' Striped beards? The sound of gentle kazoos filled
my ears. Waiters were tossing buckets of water in the gutters.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, we sat down on a bench facing Bishopsgate Street. ``I
like looking at the chimneys,'' she said. People had obviously
begun to notice her. Or maybe they were looking at me.
</P>
<P>
   ``People wonder why I'm talking into this thing,'' she said in
her breathy voice. I could hear the click of her tape recorder
turning on, turning off. She wanted to move on. It was a sunny day.
The song ``Downtown'' was blaring inside my head, and it was hard
not to walk to the music of the gentle bossa nova. As my angel and
I strolled down the sidewalk together, I felt giddy.
</P>
<P>
   But she broke the mood. ``Woman's Body Found in Thames,'' she
read from a paper on the newsstand. Then she saw him: ``There's a
man in a suit coming towards me. His shirt collar is too tight.''
</P>
<P>
   She slipped into a nearby church. But for me, it was locked. She
told me to wait in the garden. ``It smells like incense in here,''
she told me, as if we were on walkie-talkies. Outside I smelled
flowers in the sun. She listened to the organ and reminisced about
her father's heavy breathing in church and the way the sun used to
move through the figures in the stained glass. I was locked
outside, listening to bird song and looking at trampled thistle.
Finally she came outside to join me and quickly noticed ``an older
man with a black jacket, tuning his radio.''
</P>
<P>
   She told me her dream of a polar bear and pointed out a woman
with red hair reading a book called ``Body Identified.'' Was she
pointing herself out to me? It didn't matter. No one was there.
</P>
<P>
   At last we reached a McDonald's at the Liverpool Street train
station. I had long since given up sorting out the layers of sound
and story in my head. There were literary voices reading
hard-boiled crime stories, loud birds in the plaza, skirmishes on
the street, working people having lunch, a man singing lieder,
another man saying, ``Her letter made no sense to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly she said: ``I have to leave now. I wanted to walk you
to the library, but there isn't enough time.'' She left. Walking
back quietly to the Whitechapel Library, I found my eyes wide open.
I saw a man on a cell phone, iron manhole covers in the cobblestone
streets, dog dung in the gutter, a fashion shoot on the sidewalk.
The voice inside my head had finally stopped. I was cured.

ISRAELIS OUTRAGED OVER RABBI'S REMARK ON HOLOCAUST VICTIMS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN F. BURNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The 80-year-old spiritual leader of Israel's largest
strictly observant political party outraged many Israelis with a
sermon over the weekend in which he said that the 6 million Jews
who perished in the Holocaust died because they were reincarnations
of sinners, and he sought Monday to calm the storm.
</P>
<P>
   In a new sermon, the spiritual leader, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef,
offered no explicit apology for his remarks in a broadcast on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But the Baghdad-born rabbi, the pre-eminent figure in the Shas
party, which holds a key bloc of 17 seats in Israel's 120-seat
Parliament, appeared to backtrack from his earlier statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six million Jews, among them 1 million children, were killed
by the wicked Nazis,'' he said. `` All were holy and pure and
complete saints.''
</P>
<P>
   The new sermon, carried like the earlier one over a
party-controlled radio station and relayed by satellite overseas,
contained no hint of contrition for remarks about the peace efforts
that insulted Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The rabbi said on Saturday that Prime Minister Ehud Barak, by
``bringing snakes beside us'' with the compromises he had put
forward at the recent Camp David talks, had demonstrated that he
had ``no brains.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the outcry from rabbis, politicians and Jewish leaders
around the world, many voices in Israel dismissed the earlier
remarks as the ramblings of a bellicose old man with a long record
of provocations. A commentary in Monday's editions of Yedioth
Ahronoth, the country's most widely circulated newspaper, described
him as ``an aging political hack who has lost control of his
tongue.''
</P>
<P>
   But other Israelis were less ready to dismiss the remarks, and
not only because of the deep offense they caused. Yosef remains
important to the peace efforts, if only because his party of
strictly observant Jews may determine whether Barak succeeds in
rebuilding his shattered coalition government.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the controversy raged, officials in Barak's Labor Party
confirmed Monday that contacts were continuing to lure the rabbi's
Shas Party back into the governing coalition that began to
disintegrate last month, before peace talks at Camp David failed.
</P>
<P>
   Shas and two other right-wing parties quit in protest against
Barak's peace plans, prompting other defections that have left
Barak, by the estimate of many Israeli commentators, with the
assured support of barely a third of the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Some commentators said that Barak, in careful comments on
Yosef's Holocaust remarks on Sunday, had ``pandered'' to the rabbi
so as not to spoil the chances that Shas would rejoin the
government, or at least back efforts to revive peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said the remarks were unworthy of Yosef's status, and
added, ``His words could harm the memory of those who perished in
the Holocaust and could hurt the feelings of their families and the
feelings of the entire nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak's restraint brought a chorus of criticism. ``Any pursuit
by Ehud Barak of the blasphemous rabbi, from this moment on, should
be considered as unconscionable kowtowing, as the abandonment of
any semblance of self-respect, and as groveling for the seats that
will give this government another few months,'' said Shalom
Yerushalmi, a columnist in Maariv, another major paper.
</P>
<P>
   Bannered in newspaper headlines and given top billing in radio
and television newscasts, the rabbi's remarks became the principal
talking point wherever Israelis gathered. Although Yosef has been
at the center of controversy before, commentators said they could
recall no occasion in the country's 52-year history when an Israeli
public figure had caused such an outcry.
</P>
<P>
   One of the harshest condemnations came from Yosef Lapid, a
68-year-old member of Parliament and Holocaust survivor whose
father died in the death camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I hear Rabbi Yosef's words, I feel that my father was
murdered a second time,'' said Lapid, who is leader of the
secularist Shinui party. ``If an important rabbi in Israel comes
and says that 6 million Jews who died in the Holocaust were sinning
souls, it's tantamount to his saying that Hitler was doing holy
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Others saw the remarks as a reflection of the divisions between
the European Ashkenazi Jews and Sephardic Jews, mainly from the
Middle East and north Africa, whose political power has grown. Shas
draws much of its support from working class Sephardis, a fact
alluded to by Lapid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems that Rabbi Yosef wanted to say that Ashkenazis sinned
and that is why they died in the Holocaust,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still others said they feared the remarks could encourage
anti-Semites who deny that the Holocaust occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Other critics saw Yosef's remarks about Palestinians as an
attempt to complicate the peace efforts further. But if the rabbi
intended to impede the peace efforts by insulting Palestinians, the
signs Monday were that he had failed. Israel Radio and the Agence
France-Presse news agency reported that Yasser Arafat, the
Palestinian leader, had told reporters in the Gulf state of Abu
Dhabi that President Clinton could set up a new summit meeting
after the Democratic National Convention ends on Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   But officials in Barak's office, quoted by Israel radio Monday,
said that it was ``premature'' to talk of a new summit meeting. An
American official with first-hand knowledge of the Camp David talks
said the United States would not be ready to call a new summit
without ``an indication that something has changed'' in the
negotiating stands of the two sides.

LIEBERMAN VIEWED AS KINDRED SPIRIT BY MANY EVANGELICAL CHRISTIANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See GORE-LIEBERMAN and related stories) 
 By LAURIE GOODSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Sen. Joseph Lieberman, Al Gore has managed to choose as his
running mate an Orthodox Jew whom many Christians _ and especially
conservative evangelicals _ regard as an ally on many social and
moral issues.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has been seen by some Christians as a kindred spirit
for his willingness to speak of the influence of religion in his
life. His talk of the Talmud inspiring both his values and his vote
has often been cited by those Christians who believe the Bible
ought to guide public policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a lot of serious Christians in America, the fact that he's
an observant Jew would be viewed very positively,'' said the Rev.
Richard John Neuhaus, a Catholic priest who is the editor of
``First Things,'' a neoconservative religious journal. ``America is
incorrigibly and confusedly a religious nation, and the fact that a
person is viewed as religiously devout, someone who lives what he
believes, is clearly a plus.''
</P>
<P>
   Some political scholars dismiss the idea that Christians, who
account for 85 percent of voters, would react negatively to a a Jew
on a national ticket.
</P>
<P>
   America has changed, they say. In 1937, only 46 percent of
voters surveyed in a Gallup poll said they would vote for a Jew if
the candidate was qualified. By 1999, 92 percent of voters said
they would. Other polls have found similar results.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that those numbers are so high,'' said John C. Green
director of the Ray Bliss Institute of Applied Politics at the
University of Akron, ``suggests that even if there is a hidden bias
that people are unwilling to admit to pollsters, it is not
substantial enough to make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   There are anti-Semitic racist groups that call themselves
Christian ``churches,'' said Green, but they have few adherents and
are so alienated from politics that many do not even vote. Some
African-Americans harbor anti-Semitic attitudes borne of years of
conflict, said Green, but not enough to change the vote of a
constituency that usually votes solidly Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Lieberman has championed some of the issues dear
to Catholics, mainline Protestants, and conservative Christian
evangelicals.
</P>
<P>
   He has supported school vouchers and pushed for the State
Department to punish countries for religious persecution.
</P>
<P>
   His speech on the Senate floor in 1998 denouncing President
Clinton for sexual immorality won praise from Christian clergy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the vice president made an excellent choice,'' said
the Rev. Jerry Falwell, a founder of the Moral Majority, in an
interview. ``It is a public acknowledgment that his candidacy has
two great needs. One is credibility, which Mr. Lieberman brings to
anything he touches. The second is an everlasting divorce from Bill
Clinton, and this is that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is acknowledging that character, not the economy, is the
issue in November,'' said Falwell, who is actively supporting Gov.
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   R. Albert Mohler Jr., president of the Southern Baptist
Theological Seminary in Louisville, Ky., said, ``American
evangelicals respect persons of great moral substance and
conviction, and we certainly share with Senator Lieberman a great
moral heritage to which we are both committed, in terms of the Old
Testament, the Hebrew scriptures, and most essentially, the Ten
Commandments.
</P>
<P>
   Mohler, Neuhaus and others noted, however, that having the Ten
Commandments in common is not enough. Many Catholics and
evanglicals who oppose abortion and homosexuality would not vote
for a Gore-Lieberman ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evangelicals are not going to be deceived in believing that
this represents a shift to the right on the Democratic ticket,''
Mohler said.
</P>
<P>
   But the evangelical vote is far from monolithic. There are
evangelicals who care more about poverty than abortion, more about
environmentalism than homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not everyone who is pro-life uses that issue as a litmus test
for who they are going to vote for,'' said Rabbi Yechiel Eckstein,
an Orthodox Jew who founded the International Fellowship of
Christians and Jews, based in Chicago. Lieberman served as co-chair
of the group's Washington affiliate, the Center for Jewish and
Christian Values, along with Sen. Dan Coats, a conservative
evangelical Christian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are many, many Americans who may be committed to
the pro-life platform, but who give equal value to violence on TV,
to morality in the public square, and integrity in the White
House,'' said Eckstein, ``and I think they would look to somebody
like Joe Lieberman for leadership in those areas.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Henry Blodget's words used to add rocket fuel to the
new economy. On Monday, Merrill Lynch's star Internet analyst
re-entered the atmosphere, downgrading 10 of the 26 companies he
covers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are resetting the investment ratings for our Internet
universe,'' Blodget wrote in a report. Four months after the start
of the April bloodbath that halted the Internet's unfettered
charge, one of the most reliable of Internet bulls is finally
showing signs of doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Blodget, 34, is considered one of the Internet sector's two
premier analysts, along with Mary Meeker of Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter. Last month, Meeker showed a speck of caution when she
raised her loss-per-share estimates for Amazon.com, but she stopped
short of a downgrade. Blodget has countered with a raft of
downgrades, but on Monday they barely registered across the sector.
</P>
<P>
   TheStreet.com Internet index gained 4.07 percent, and even
several of the names Blodget downgraded surged forward. Why? Maybe
because of how far they have already fallen. The analyst, who once
led the market up, now appears to be following it down.
</P>
<P>
   This has not been a banner year for Blodget, even by the recent
anemic standards of Internet investors. Of the 26 stocks he covers,
nine of the companies are new to the group this year. The other 18
stocks, which he has covered all year, are down an average of 54.7
percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this has been an abysmal year for investing in
Internet stocks. TheStreet.com Internet index is down 33.8 percent.
Since April, Internet mutual funds have had a choke hold on the
bottom of the barrel, entrenched as the worst-performing funds
among all domestic mutual fund categories this year.
</P>
<P>
   Comparing an analyst's picks to a mutual fund has its flaws, but
it can be useful for a rough picture. Blodget's average return
ranks behind even the worst-performing domestic mutual fund, Jacob
Internet, which is down 51.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Only one of his 17 year-long picks, Inktomi, has gained this
year. Six have lost more than 70 percent of their value. EToys has
lost 84.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is no longer giving some companies the benefit of
the doubt,'' said Blodget in an interview. ``We're acknowledging
that. The sector is so volatile that it's made some of the ratings
meaningless.''
</P>
<P>
   Figuring heavily into the ``resetting'' of Blodget's downgraded
names were e-commerce stocks. Perhaps the fact that TheStreet.com
E-Commerce index had already fallen 65.5 percent for the year when
the day began meant that there was not much more room for the group
to tumble. Some did fall. Buy.com dropped by 16.2 percent. Others
soared. Doubleclick, the Internet advertising firm, gained 9.77
percent following Blodget's downgrade. IVillage, the beleaguered
portal aimed at women that Blodget downgraded to accumulate from
accumulate/buy, gained 4.85 percent. And Barnesandnoble.com soared
38.3 percent after it struck a deal with Microsoft to create an
online store for digital books.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor could be that Blodget's report was far from a
stark reappraisal of the sector's prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of the reset is not to make a new `call' on the
direction of the group,'' the report said, ``but to provide a more
precise differentiation of our current opinions (by using a wider
range of ratings.)''
</P>
<P>
   A wider range of negative ratings, that is. For those who
actually followed his recommendations, it might come as cold
comfort that Blodget has decided to add a new word to his lexicon
of ratings. Before Monday, his ratings have all been combinations
of one of two words, either ``buy'' or ``accumulate,'' which is
more tepid than a buy recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Now Blodget has added the word ``neutral'' to his repertoire.
Previously, none of the 26 Internet stocks Blodget covered merited
a neutral rating. Neutral, according to Merrill Lynch, means that
it is not clear when a company will be profitable and that
``significant uncertanties or reservations remain.'' In plain
English _ though analysts rarely admit as much _it is roughly
analogous to a ``thumbs down'' from Roger Ebert.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's trying to say, `Look, there are a handful of
companies that are going to be stellar. Those are the Yahoos and
AOLs and maybe Inktomi,'' said James Houlton, manager of the Strong
Internet fund. ``As the market has put the Internet in its place,
it has put him in his place, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with just about everybody else, as Houlton added.
</P>
<P>
   So which companies picked up the dread word neutral? Monday,
eToys, the online toy seller, was downgraded from an accumulate/buy
rating to neutral. Barnesandnoble.com fared slightly better,
downgraded from an accumulate/buy rating to neutral/buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is focused on now is profitability,'' said Blodget. ``I
think we have been very vocal about the stage of the industry's
development. We suggested as far back as last July that this was
going to be a rough time.''
</P>
<P>
   In December 1998, when the Internet was still something of a
novelty item, Blodget predicted that Amazon.com would climb to $400
a share. His prediction made him the butt of jokes in some
quarters, until Amazon hit $400 a few weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Blodget left his job at CIBC/Oppenheimer for a blue
chip post at Merrill Lynch. His picks became a roadmap for some
investors. This year, the road has become less traveled.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an emerging sector like this,'' he said, ``you are going to
make mistakes picking stocks.''

  Rock en espanol hopes radio play 
can help build a popular following 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
By SANDRA BARRERA 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Watcha Tour launches on its 18-city trek Friday across
America from the Universal Amphitheatre, a proclamation will be
made declaring it ``Watcha 2000-Rock En Espanol Day in the City of
Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony here is that while rock en espanol is important enough
to have its own day in L.A., it can only be heard on the concert
stage since it's little played over the airwaves. Like country or
rock stations, Spanish radio is locked into the same format,
leaving no room for bands with a cult following.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge market that these people don't recognize,'' says
Emilio Morales, who publishes the Spanish answer to Rolling Stone
magazine, La Banda Elastica.
</P>
<P>
   By Warner Music Latin America estimates, nearly 40 million
Latinos in the United States buy rock en espanol CDs and flock to
its concerts annually.
</P>
<P>
   Morales says a large percentage of those people live in L.A.,
which is considered to be the rock en espanol capital of America.
He believes it has to do with the city's proximity to Mexico, as
well as the growing Latino population familiar with the rock en
espanol scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``When some of the best recording artists in Latin America and
Spain come here to record,'' he says, ``then go out and play small
clubs for the fun of it, people get really excited.''
</P>
<P>
   One group that generates a lot of that excitement is Mexico's
Cafe Tacuba.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, the band has toured the United States and attracted
people to its fusion of hip-hop, punk and folk music.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, Cafe Tacuba has toured with Beck and been
nominated for a Latin Grammy _ to be presented next month at the
Staples Center _ for Best Rock Album for its last album ``Reves,''
an album that has sold 60,000 copies in the United States. (``A
success is 50,000 units for a start up artist on U.S. labels,''
says Maribel Schumacher, who is vice president of marketing for
Warner Music Latin America. ``Our artists are selling that and way
more.'')
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Cafe Tacuba is gearing up for the Watcha Tour,
described as a Spanish version of the Warped Tour without the
skateboards and second stage acts.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the bands that are on Watcha have had relatively long
careers in their own countries,'' says Quique Rangel, who plays
bass for Cafe Tacuba, which has played together for the last 11
years. ``It would be absurd for a group whose been playing together
as long as we have to play the Warped Tour. But the Watcha Tour is
a good way to give bands from Latin America exposure to an American
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was first introduced to America in the late 1980s, rock
en espanol appealed to Latin immigrants already familiar with this
kind of rock in their countries.
</P>
<P>
   The rock scene has been thriving in Argentina since 1965, fueled
by the politically charged band Los Gatos Salvajes. Mexico's El Tri
helped shape the movement from covering '70s rock bands to
composing its own homespun sound.
</P>
<P>
   In Spain, the rock scene didn't take off until the mid-1980s,
several years after the death of Francisco Franco, the fascist
dictator who ruled the country for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan Dhu, a new wave band from Spain, was one of the first
artist to play America in 1989 on a 14-city club tour billed as the
``Rock En Espanol Tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumacher, who was then an independent band promoter, lost a
lot of money on that tour. ``It's always a question of somebody
taking the initiative,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said about the Watcha Tour, now in its second
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to work as a unification force within rock en
espanol,'' says Kevin Lyman, one of the tour's creators. ``We're
trying to grow the scene all across the labels so there's Warner
acts, there's Universal acts, there's independent acts.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Warped Tour we kind of unified everyone under the
umbrella of Warped and it's basically made the scene very strong
and large,'' he says. ``And we're trying to do the same for the
rock en espanol community.''
</P>
<P>
   He says one way of doing this is to put acts like the
Argentinean hard rock band A.N.I.M.A.L. on both the Warped and
Watcha tours for maximum exposure. The same was done with L.A.'s
Ozomatli and Mexico's Molotov last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this year we'll see some of our more musically
creative fans (from the Warped Tour) in the (Watcha) audience just
because they're starting to understand that wow, bands like
Ozomatli or Molotov and now A.N.I.M.A.L. are so great,'' Lyman
says. ``They're finding this is a music that has just been under
represented.''
</P>
<P>
   Another line of attack is expanding the Watcha Tour from last
year's 11 dates up to an 18-city trek.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to play in a few cities that we've never been
before so that's nice,'' says Andrea Echeverri, who fronts the
folksy Columbian punk band Aterciopelados.
</P>
<P>
   Echeverri says that the band, which is finishing work on a new
album yet to be titled, has always been received warmly by Latinos
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the United States, you always feel this warmth like you're
bringing something to them,'' she says. ``Some Spanish. Some
cultural roots. A bit of musical roots, as well. Identity. All
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But are they mainstream enough to land on commercial radio?
</P>
<P>
   The two Latin Top 40 Latin stations in L.A. _ 97.5 F.M.-KSSE and
107.1 F.M.-KLYY _ play dance music and hits by larger rock bands
such as Jaguares, Enanitos Verdes and Mana.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the number of artists who don't get recognition is very
big,'' says Patricio Flores, owner of the rock en espanol record
store Aventura Musical in Hollywood. ``We don't even hear one
percent of the rock that's being created.''
</P>
<P>
   KLYY broadcasts a rock en espanol show called ``The Red Zone''
on Sundays from 5 to 7:30 p.m. It plays old and new acts. But
unless these songs chart, programmers have no intention of making
these artists part of the station's regular programming.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Perez, music director at KLYY, says that while he
acknowledges rock en espanol is growing, ``radio stations are
looking for the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rock en espanol doesn't draw enough people to make it an
important revenue,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But Cafe Tacuba's Quique Rangel believes sooner or later that
perception will change with more people jumping on the rock en
espanol bandwagon. The latest is Batanga.com, an online radio
station that streams rock en espanol music and interviews 24-hours
a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll probably do it at first because they like the music,''
Rangel says. ``But in the end, they'll probably do it more for the
money.''

VENTURE CAPITAL STILL ROLLING IN DESPITE TECH STOCK RETREAT

<TEXT>
<P>
   Even as the public stock markets cooled, the level of venture
capital investment nationwide changed little in the second quarter,
the National Venture Capital Association reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, more companies received investments in the April-June
period than in either of the previous two quarters, though the
amount invested declined slightly for the second straight quarter
after growing at a blistering pace last year.
</P>
<P>
   And the survey found that e-commerce companies have fallen out
of favor, with Internet-related investments focused increasingly on
communications and infrastructure start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that the nation's 640 venture capital firms,
and the venture investment arms of corporations, poured $24.5
billion into 1,695 companies, compared with investments of $24.8
billion in 1,627 companies in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the increase from a year earlier was striking. In the
second quarter of 1999, $12.5 billion was invested in 1,168
start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   But since April, when the value of many technology stocks
tumbled, some venture capitalists have said they were investing in
start-ups less aggressively than they did last year, wary that they
would not be able to take companies public so readily.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne Metzger, director of marketing for the National Venture
Capital Association, an industry trade group, said the present rate
of investment showed that venture firms were still financing
entrepreneurs at a healthy rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The VC industry continues to grow at a strong pace,'' she
said, particularly ``when you take into account that this was a
period of substantial market volatility.'' She added that the fact
that the investment rate leveled off should not be cause for
concern because the growth in investing last year _ an increase of
150 percent over the total in 1998 _ was unsustainable.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, conducted in conjunction with Venture Economics, a
division of Thomson Financial Securities Data, found that
Internet-related investments grew to $19.9 billion in the second
quarter, from $19 billion in the previous period. Of such
investments, communications and infrastructure companies _ such as
those focused on wireless technology, telephony, or voice and data
transmission _ attracted 26.9 percent, compared with 20.1 percent
in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   E-commerce companies, in contrast, attracted 14.5 percent of
Internet-related investments, compared with 27.2 percent in during
first quarter. &QL;

INDIAN TRIBES IN MICHIGAN SIGN FISHING ACCORD WITH GOVERNMENTS

<TEXT>
<P>
   PESHAWBESTOWN, Mich. _ The federal government, the state of
Michigan and five American Indian tribes in northern Michigan
signed an agreement Monday aimed at rebuilding fish populations in
the upper Great Lakes and improving strained relations between
whites and Indians in upstate Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   The pact settles 27 years of litigation over whether the state
can restrict Indian fishing, people involved in the negotiations
said.
</P>
<P>
   A vibrant national economy has created a boom in vacation homes
and tourism here in the northern third of Michigan's Lower
Peninsula. The accompanying surge in pleasure boating and
recreational fishing has increased tensions between whites and
Indians, as pleasure boats become dangerously entangled in Indian
nets and charter boat operators blame the Indian fishermen for
depleting trout and salmon populations.
</P>
<P>
   Some Indian nets have been sabotaged, state officials say.
Indian leaders have denied that they are responsible for declining
fish stocks and have angrily denounced what they have described as
efforts to take away some of the few ancestral rights they retain.
</P>
<P>
   The pact calls for the tribes to reduce drastically their use of
large-mesh gill nets, which kill fish of various sizes and species
and can entangle boats. The Indians are to replace gill nets with
trap nets, which allow fishermen to catch fish more discriminately
and are less likely to entangle other boats. The state government
will pay $17 million to buy boats equipped with trap nets and
fishing permits from white-owned companies and give them to Indian
fishermen to replace boats with gill nets.
</P>
<P>
   The trap-net fishing permits are mainly for remote areas of
northwestern Lake Michigan and northern Lake Huron, pulling Indian
fishermen far from Michigan's main recreational boating and fishing
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, the federal government will pay another
$8.3 million to the five tribal governments. The tribes are
expected to use some or all of the money to compensate small-scale
Indian fishing operations, which will not receive the trap-net
boats but will face restrictions on gill-net fishing for the next
20 years. Use of large-mesh gill nets by non-Indians has been
heavily restricted since 1968.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has been particularly acrimonious here in this
Indian community and eight miles west in the mainly white town of
Leland. Both towns are on the northwest shore of Michigan's Lower
Peninsula, 220 miles northwest of Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   For whites like John Lindenau, who stood on the dock in Leland
on Monday morning next to his 30-foot charter fishing boat, the
Infinity, the dispute has been about imposing the same rules on
Indians that white fishermen must meet. ``We won the Indian wars
and gave it all away,'' Lindenau said, blaming the Indians for what
he said was the disappearance of lake trout in the area.
</P>
<P>
   But here in Peshawbestown, on the tiny reservation of the Grand
Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, the agreement is the
cause of considerable bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Grand Traverse Band hesitantly, really hesitantly agreed
to sign off on the deal,'' said Ardith Chambers, one of seven
members of the tribal council, as she sat glumly in her office
Monday afternoon. ``All the state wants to do is take apart treaty
rights, and so does the federal government.''
</P>
<P>
   The five tribes ceded the upper third of Michigan's Lower
Peninsula and the eastern half of Michigan's Upper Peninsula to the
federal government in the Treaty of Washington, concluded in 1836.
That treaty allowed the Indians to continue fishing in the region,
but allowed non-Indian fishing, too. The Indians have used the
treaty to oppose efforts by the state to limit Indian fishing,
because the treaty was signed a year before Michigan became a
state.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Traverse Band has only a dozen fishermen left. Most
will lose their livelihoods because they do not catch enough fish
to qualify for trap-net boats from the state, and they will face
new restrictions on the use of gill nets, Chambers said.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Traverse Band agreed to the pact because it was
engaged in a separate dispute with the state over its main
livelihood, the Turtle Creek Casino, a few miles east of Traverse
City. Although the state never explicitly linked the issues, the
tribe is so dependent on the casino that it felt compelled to
accept the fishing deal.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the four Upper Peninsula tribes, the Grand Traverse Band
is far from the trap-net fishing grounds being established. The
pact was signed Monday night in Brimley.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers along the coastal highway here in northern Michigan find
that Peshawbestown, with its battered trailers and small wood
houses, is a sharp contrast to other communities. The coastline
elsewhere has many million-dollar mansions, often built in the last
few years.
</P>
<P>
   Leland has older houses and has been a fishing center since the
late 1800s; the old wood fishing shanties and smokehouses of its
Fishtown neighborhood are popular with tourists. Leland fishermen
say that the trout population has plunged in recent years, and
blame two large, Indian gill-net boats moored Monday morning at the
Leland dock.
</P>
<P>
   But Indian officials attribute the fish shortage to
environmental factors, like unusually warm lake water in recent
years.

<TEXT>
<P>
   At the Republican Convention last week, Colin Powell boldly
challenged his party to be inclusive and follow the leadership of
George W. Bush in Texas. As a model of inclusive reform, he touted
Texas' 10 percent plan, which grants automatic admission to the
flagship public colleges to all state students graduating in the
top 10 percent of their high school classes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush calls this plan, which has been remarkably successful, an
example of his compassionate conservatism. But this claim would be
more convincing if his oratory about the program today had been
matched by action when it was being debated. The Texas Legislature
adopted it in 1997, after a U.S. Court of Appeals ruling, the
Hopwood decision, had outlawed affirmative action at the University
of Texas. Black and Hispanic state legislators conceived and
advocated the plan. Bush's contribution? He didn't veto it.
</P>
<P>
   During the debate over the bill, Bush ``never publicly supported
the idea,'' says Irma Rangel, the Democratic chairwoman of the
higher education subcommittee in the Texas House and the plan's
sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has about 1,500 high schools. But before the program's
inception, the University of Texas at Austin, the most selective
state-supported Texas college, filled 75 percent of its freshman
seats from about 150 economically privileged suburban and private
schools. Under the 10 percent plan, several poor white counties in
rural West Texas sent graduates to Austin for the first time.
Moreover, about 300 African-American freshmen were enrolled last
year, a 50 percent increase over the year immediately after the
Hopwood decision ended affirmative action. The number of Hispanic
students has also increased, to more than when affirmative action
was the official policy.
</P>
<P>
   (It is worth noting that the plan ensures integration at the
university level even if the high schools remain segregated. But as
some national Democrats point out, the plan is not a panacea for
educational reform, especially in states without the extraordinary
racial and economic segregation of Texas.)
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to the fears that they would be unqualified, the 10
percenters exceeded expectations; their collective grade point
average in their first year of college was higher than the freshman
average for all students before the Hopwood decision. Part of their
achievement comes from the university's efforts to make the school
itself smarter. The university created more small classes for
freshmen and allocated full scholarships to high schools with large
numbers of poor and working-class students.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these successes, and despite the high regard in which
Bush professes to hold the plan, there are rumblings among
Republicans about trying to change it in the next legislative
session. They want to restore a requirement that applicants take
the SAT, which rewards those who can afford coaching and test
preparation and does not predict the qualities of leadership and
achievement that the university values. And Bush is notably quiet
about these proposed overhauls. ``Hopwood required forward
thinking, and he's been passive,'' Michael Olivas, a professor at
the University of Houston who specializes in higher education law,
says of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 percent plan has worked in Texas to spread educational
opportunity to those who have had too little of it. It never would
have happened without leadership of people of color. Bush should be
bold enough to credit the black and brown leaders who gave him the
opportunity to crow about its success today. That would be
inclusiveness.
</P>

and the University of Texas, respectively, are authors of the
forthcoming ``The Miner's Canary.'')

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the midst of World War II, when my Uncle Seymour was about to
have his bar mitzvah, my grandmother went to the rabbi of their
Bronx synagogue with a request. At the climax of the ceremony, when
Seymour would march through the sanctuary bearing the Torah
scrolls, the rabbi should follow, holding aloft a portrait of
Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   That the rabbi eagerly complied with this motherly meddling
attests to more than the Jewish devotion to FDR. It served as a
vivid reminder that even in tolerant America, even at a time of
Nazi extermination abroad, most Jews depended on a righteous
gentile like Roosevelt to protect them and their interests. To
shout out on their own behalf, to draw attention to their tiny
share of the American populace, was to court anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   More than a half-century later, Al Gore has shattered the
enduring concept of American Jewish insecurity by naming as his
running mate Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, the first Jew
ever on a major party's presidential ticket. And in ways he himself
may not even understand, Gore has sent a powerful message by
choosing a Jew who is Orthodox, and, more specifically, Modern
Orthodox.
</P>
<P>
   For much of this century, the Jews who rose in government
service or partisan politics tended to be of Reform belief and
German ancestry. Herbert Lehman, Henry Morgenthau and Felix
Frankfurter arose from a subculture of Jews who had shed much
observance and ritual, who had embraced English liturgy as part of
becoming American. All these men, in their way, were domestic
equivalents of the shtadtlan of Eastern Europe's ghettos, the
communal diplomats who pleaded the Jewish community's concerns to
the crown.
</P>
<P>
   By now, so much has changed that a nation that is only 2 percent
Jewish has elected 34 Jews to both houses of Congress. Yet even
amid such company Lieberman stands out because of his public
observance. He is not Sandy Koufax or Hank Greenberg, making a show
of not playing ball on Yom Kippur while otherwise living a
relatively nonreligious life. Lieberman worships at Kesher Israel,
an Orthodox synagogue in Georgetown, and observes the 613
commandments, the mitzvot. If there is a vital session of Congress
on the Sabbath, he still attends and votes, but he walks rather
than drives.
</P>
<P>
   And recognizing that balance is essential to understanding
Lieberman's significance in the world of American Jewry. The Modern
Orthodox movement believes in the concept of Torah Umaddah _
literally ``Torah and worldly knowledge,'' but more broadly, the
value of engaging with the larger society.
</P>
<P>
   It is precisely this style of Orthodoxy that has been whipsawed
by two contradictory trends _ ever-increasing assimilation by less
observant Jews and withering criticism by ultra-Orthodox Jews who
view secular America as a spiritual pollutant that must be handled
only to the extent necessary.
</P>
<P>
   It could be that Joseph Lieberman earned his place on Al Gore's
ticket during the Monica Lewinsky scandal, when he rose in the
Senate to despair over a president's conduct. From a purely
pragmatic standpoint, that speech may help Gore distance himself
from Clinton's personal behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Far more important, though, Lieberman's oration, suffused as it
was with a religious man's sense of propriety, offered proof that a
Jew in modern America need not diminish his faith as the price of
worldly achievement or consider such faith alone a replacement for
the crucible of public life.

University, is the author of ``Jew vs. Jew: The Struggle for the

 &HT;    The system is what keeps the Braves rolling along
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cincinnati - Their reputation was for professionalism, winning
and confidence, not to mention pitching. So in March 1999 when Mike
Remlinger followed Tom Glavine to the Braves clubhouse after a
spring training game in St. Petersburg, he was shocked to hear
these words: ``Man, I had no idea what I was doing out there,''
Glavine said.
</P>
<P>
   Remlinger, acquired from Cincinnati, also had struggled in his
first game with the Braves. It was only spring training, but
Remlinger, retelling the story 1 1/2 years later, recalls trying to
unload his pitches at 100 mph to prove to the Braves he belonged.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't work out for him on the mound, but it did later in the
Braves clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `What? You have days like that too?' '' Remlinger
said. ``It was something that simple . . . that it was OK to have a
bad day.''
</P>
<P>
   Remlinger is one of many players who have thrived in the
``relaxed'' atmosphere of the Braves organization. Andy Ashby and
B.J. Surhoff, the Braves most recent acquisitions, have noticed the
same thing. And they're not just talking about the quiet afternoons
in the clubhouse, where games of hearts and rummy are being played,
or the post-game locker room, where there's no music blaring to
dictate whether the team won or lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The atmosphere around here is a part of who we are and what
makes us successful,'' said Glavine, who has helped set the tone
since the Braves run of success in 1991. ``A very businesslike
approach, a demeanor of confidence. . . . ``Sometimes we're
perceived as being cocky, but I think a lot of guys who come over
here from other organizations find out right away this is a good
situation. Our atmosphere is one that's easy to fit in and feel
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you not (like it)? You're playing for a manager who
treats you like a man, playing for an organization that's fair and
does what it can to win, and you're playing with good guys,''
Glavine said.
</P>
<P>
   Remlinger often struggled before finding this peace and
performance in Atlanta. Playing out the first year of his first
multi-year contract, Remlinger has become the most reliable
reliever and a poster boy for what works for the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   He has talked to pitcher Stan Belinda, the newest addition,
every day since he arrived a week ago. Belinda was released by the
Rockies after compiling a 7.07 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Belinda, `This is the best place you'll ever play,'''
Remlinger said. ``I'll come back in a month and you'll tell me
that. You'll pitch better than you've ever pitched.''
</P>
<P>
   Remlinger said it all adds up to success _ from the rules Bobby
Cox has for the clubhouse, to the way he and his coaches runs team
meetings, to the availability of the support staff .
</P>
<P>
   He has heard his teammate John Burkett say again and again,
``I've played baseball for 13 years, and I've finally gotten to the
big leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of teams have people watching every move you make,''
said Burkett, who joined the Braves at the end of spring training
after being released by Tampa Bay. ``Here it's more of a relaxed
atmosphere. They expect you to get it done and be prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox's rules are simple: If players want to listen to music in
the clubhouse they must wear headphones, eliminating arguments that
are common in other clubhouses. Players can't talk on cell phones
in the clubhouse. Players can't have family or friends in the
clubhouse after 3 p.m. The same rules apply for all players, stars
included.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby treats everybody the same,'' Keith Lockhart said. ``It
doesn't matter if you're a bench player or Greg Maddux, you'll get
respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting pitchers can play golf, as long as it's not on the day
they pitch. Players can't wear earrings and have to dress the same
for batting practice, with no shorts or pullovers like other teams
might wear.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way I've been my whole life,'' Cox said. ``I've
always tried to have my lockermates' best interest at heart. If a
guy has to get psyched up listening to music, he can do it with
headphones. . . . You can talk. You can't talk in other
clubhouses.''
</P>
<P>
   The rules are old school, but most players have come to
appreciate them because they're intended to foster respect among
teammates, and that's something Glavine thinks carries onto the
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't like everybody; you won't go out to dinner with
everybody, but when you go on the field there's a respect factor,''
Glavine said. ``When it's time to go out and play, we have a common
goal, and it's, `I've got your back.'''
</P>
<P>
   Remlinger likes that pitchers take batting practice on the road,
something that didn't happen when he played for the Reds. He also
likes not having to stretch on the field before batting practice
like most every other major league team does.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you need to stretch at 4 when your work doesn't start
until 10?'' Remlinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Bonilla enjoyed his first spring training in which players
weren't asked to stay late into the afternoons. Cox just asks that
they get their work in early and get on with their days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best spring training I've ever had,'' Bonilla said.
``I thought I was cheating myself. I'm seeing the benefits now.
Some people call these the dog days. They don't seem to be now. And
at 37, that's a beautiful thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla's reputation was not the best when the Braves called.
But there have been no problems in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so delighted they gave me a call,'' Bonilla said. ``Even
after all the (problems), they totally disregarded all that. . . .
There's a certain professionalism in this clubhouse. There's a
relaxed atmosphere I don't think I've experienced with any team. A
clubhouse is a clubhouse, but when the bell rings, everybody is
focused and ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitchers appreciate the approach Braves coaches take during
scouting meetings, where they focus on positives. Instead of
saying, ``Mark McGwire is a great fastball hitter; don't throw him
a fastball,'' Leo Mazzone might point out that McGwire is hitting
.150 with two strikes against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You give them five, six, seven ways to get hitters out,''
Mazzone said. ``Are you going to tell Tom Glavine he's got to jam
everybody he faces? You have to make sure to take advantage of what
pitchers do best or you'll underestimate yourself or overestimate
who's hitting. You'll put yourself in a position where you're
throwing without conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   And Braves players learn to follow Cox's lead of not getting
animated after losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the game, he's intense,'' Glavine said. ``When the game
is over, he has his 5 or 10 minutes of being ticked off and it's
over, get ready for the next game. . . . What that does is give
guys a sense of security, a sense of not panicking. If you're on a
club where everybody was throwing stuff and upset, as a player that
would tend to make you go out and play fearful of making mistakes.
What will it be like after we lose? You've got to shrug it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Belinda hasn't taken a month to make up his mind about playing
for the Braves. After his first bullpen session with Mazzone, he
told Remlinger he felt like he was 19 again.
</P>
<P>
   In just more than a week, he has become a believer with two
scoreless outings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody else takes an interest in you, it boosts your
confidence,'' Belinda said. ``It gives you the feeling of these
guys really believe in me. You want to make sure you go about
things the right way and give it all you have. The confidence they
radiate rubs off on you. You start feeling it.''

A PRINCE IN EXILE LOBBIES FOR A ROMAN HOLIDAY 
</HEADLINE>
  By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ The heir to the Italian throne has never visited his
family's former realm. Barred by a 1948 constitutional amendment
that forbids direct male descendants of the last king of Italy from
setting foot on Italian soil, Prince Emanuele Filiberto di Savoia,
28, has to content himself with gazing at the shores of Sardinia
through binoculars from Corsica, where his family has a summer
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 3 when I learned two words at the same time, `Italy' and
`exile,''' Emanuele Filiberto, who was born and raised in Geneva,
said in flawless Italian over the telephone. ``For me, they were
inextricably linked.''
</P>
<P>
   Emanuele Filiberto _ the great-grandson of the wartime king,
Vittorio Emanuele III, who cooperated with Mussolini _ is lobbying
fiercely for an end to his exile. In July, he apologized on Italian
radio for the errors of his family. The gesture may help smooth his
path among republicans, but it offended Italian monarchists, who
feel the royal family has no need to apologize.
</P>
<P>
   For most, his cause does not really stir up old passions
anymore. Few Italians believe that he should be held accountable
forever for his great-grandfather's collusion with Mussolini,
particularly given the fact that Mussolini's granddaughter,
Alessandra Mussolini, is a member of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, his compatriots are betting on whether his request will
move through Italy's fractious, slow-moving Parliament in time to
meet his personal deadline of visiting Italy during this Roman
Catholic Holy Year.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Italians have followed the handsome prince's jet
set lifestyle in glossy magazines like Oggi and Gente, where he is
a celebrity along the lines of Formula One race car drivers and
former bodyguards of the princesses of Monaco.
</P>
<P>
   But in Turin, where the Savoys had their royal palace, their
claims have long been only faintly noticed. ``When we speak of
royalty here, we mean the Agnellis,'' Claudio De Consoli, a
Turin-based public relations consultant, said, referring to the
princes of Italian industry.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to the young prince's recent lobbying efforts, the
royal family's campaign _ waged in European courts, the Vatican,
the Italian Parliament and newspapers _ has become one of the more
closely watched celebrity travails of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this summer, Emanuele Filiberto, who works as a banker
in Switzerland, threatened to return to Italy on Aug. 19 for the
Vatican's World Youth Day Jubilee, saying he would enter the
country illegally if necessary. That brinkmanship seemed aimed at
taking advantage of the pope's emphasis on forgiveness and clemency
during the Holy Year, but the prince has since rethought his
tactics. ``Since I said that, there has been some movement in
political circles,'' he explained. ``I want to go home, but not as
an outlaw.''
</P>
<P>
   The Savoy dynasty was founded in the 11th century by Umberto the
Whitehanded and ruled over the territories of Savoy, in parts of
what are now France and the Italian Piedmont. In the 16th century,
the Savoys moved their seat from Chambery to Turin and gradually
expanded their territory. After the Italian Risorgimento, the
movement to create one country from a patchwork of tiny entities,
Italy was united in 1861 under Vittorio Emanuele II.
</P>
<P>
   Before World War II, Vittorio Emanuele III acquiesced to
Mussolini's dictatorship, signing the 1938 racial laws that harshly
discriminated against Jews. The royal family is also condemned for
its actions on Sept. 8, 1943, when Mussolini was overthrown and
Italy surrendered to the allies. The king and his court fled
German-occupied Rome for safety in Brindisi, abandoning Italian
troops. Hundreds of thousands of Italian soldiers were deported to
internment camps in Germany. (One of the king's sisters, Mafalda,
was arrested by the Nazis and died in Buchenwald).
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, Vittorio Emanuele III abdicated, putting his son
Umberto II on the throne in an effort to salvage the monarchy. But
Umberto II was king for only one month, until Italians voted in a
referendum to abolish the monarchy in favor of a republic. The
royal family went into exile, and in 1948 a constitutional
amendment barred their return.
</P>
<P>
   Some World War II veterans still oppose the growing consensus
for reconciling the past. ``At least wait until my generation is
gone,'' Alessandro Galante Garrone, 91, a jurist and leader of the
wartime resistance, recently told the newspaper La Repubblica. But
even many hard-core republicans say the time has come to change the
law. Mainly, the question is how.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ban makes no sense in the year 2000,'' said Giorgio La
Malfa, secretary of the Republican Party. ``We have to end it, but
with dignity.'' He said the Savoy heirs must recognize the errors
of Vittorio Emanuele III and also make a solemn statement
recognizing that Italy became a republic legitimately.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Both Emanuele Filiberto and his father, Vittorio Emanuele IV,
who went into exile in 1946 at age 9 and has also been battling for
the right to visit Italy, have recently expressed a willingness to
swear allegiance to the constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The demand that they also affirm its legitimacy is aimed at
monarchist complaints that the referendum and the constitutional
amendment that followed were legally flawed. ``We advise him not to
do it,'' said Giulio De Renoche, a member of the Monarchist
Movement of Italy. ``It hurts his prestige, and it violates the
principles of free expression.''
</P>
<P>
   And even Emanuele Filiberto expressed some irritation with La
Malfa's suggestion. ``We are asked to swear allegiance and to say
we are sorry, but the demands keep growing,'' he complained. ``It's
never enough. Next they will ask me to fly to the moon and back.''
</P>
<P>
   The prince did not rule out an eventual restoration of the
monarchy, however unlikely. ``I am from a royal family, so it is
hard for me to be against the monarchy,'' he said. ``Despite
everything, a king can be a source of stability, giving people a
unifying figure who is above politics. If the Italian people want
it, then I am ready.''
</P>
<P>
   But his fiancee, Natasha Andress Geitling, 31, a Swiss-American
who works for Sotheby's in Geneva, said his ambitions were more
modest. ``He doesn't want to be king,'' he said. ``He just wants to
see his friends and family, do a little business and travel. I
think the ban is ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Any change to the Constitution requires both houses of
Parliament to confirm it twice, making it highly unlikely that the
law could be changed before the end of the Holy Year. Instead, a
few politicians have suggested a temporary 40-day pass, an
exception that would have to be granted by the president, Carlo
Azeglio Ciampi.
</P>
<P>
   And some Italians find the whole royal fuss overrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to sell books, so obviously this whole clamor helps
me,'' said Gianni Oliva, author of a 1998 book titled, ``The
Savoys: A Dynasty's Nine Hundred Years,'' and of a coming biography
of Umberto II. ``But I think they should return in silence. I don't
think they merit so much talk.''

LIEBERMAN HAS TAKEN STANDS AT ODDS WITH HIS PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (With GORE-LIEBERMAN) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In his two terms in the Senate, Joseph Lieberman
has often taken positions at odds with Vice President Al Gore and
important constituencies of the Democratic Party on school
vouchers, affirmative action, regulation of managed care, capital
gains taxes and product liability.
</P>
<P>
   He has sided with the Clinton administration on all important
budget votes, and unlike many other Democrats, he has supported the
administration's positions on trade and welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's views are completely in tune with the vice
president's on abortion, the environment, gun control and gay
rights.
</P>
<P>
   On Social Security, a central point of conflict between Gore and
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, Lieberman has suggested that he could
support allowing workers to invest a portion of their payroll taxes
in the private markets. That is Bush's position. But Lieberman has
never been faced with a vote on the matter and never made explicit
what kind of investments he would allow and in what circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   He has usually supported the Clinton administration on foreign
policy issues, and in 1991, Lieberman and Gore, who was then a
senator, were among only 10 Democratic senators who voted to give
President George Bush the authority to use military force in the
Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   When he has opposed the Clinton administration, Lieberman has
invariably taken a more conservative stance, often the one held by
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   For example, since he first entered the Senate, Lieberman has
supported and sponsored legislation establishing pilot programs in
which the federal government would give parents vouchers they could
use to pay their children's tuition at private schools, including
those with religious affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has argued that such programs could undermine public
schools. Teachers unions, which are important supporters of
Democratic causes and contributors to Democratic candidates,
strenuously oppose vouchers. And many Democrats believe that
vouchers violate the doctrine of separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly because of Democratic opposition, no voucher plan has
ever become law.
</P>
<P>
   But in testimony in 1997 before a Senate committee about schools
in the District of Columbia, Lieberman declared: ``There are some
who dismiss suggestions of school choice programs and charter
schools out of hand, direly predicting that these approaches will
`ruin' the public schools. The undeniable reality here is that this
system is already in ruins, and to blindly reject new models and
refuse to try new ideas is simply foolish. We can and must do
better for these children, and to cling stubbornly to the failures
of the past will just not get us there.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Lieberman has been critical of programs that give
special breaks to blacks and other groups to make up for past
discrimination. Gore has been a strong supporter of affirmative
action.
</P>
<P>
   And in a speech on the Senate floor in 1995, Lieberman said:
``Affirmative action is dividing us in ways its creators could
never have intended because most Americans who do support equal
opportunity and are not biased don't think it is fair to
discriminate against some Americans as a way to make up for
historic discrimination against other Americans. For after all, if
you discriminate in favor of one group on the basis of race, you
thereby discriminate against another group on the basis of race.''
</P>
<P>
   On managed care, Lieberman was part of a bipartisan group that
tried unsuccessfully last year to break a deadlock between the
Clinton administration and Republican senators over how to regulate
health plans. The administration maintained that the legislation
Lieberman favored would have been too generous to insurance
companies. Consumer groups and labor unions were among those siding
with the administration.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, when Democratic senators used a filibuster
to block the Bush administration's proposal for a cut in the
capital gains tax, Lieberman opposed his party's leaders and voted
with Republicans against the filibuster and in favor of the tax
cut.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has also regularly voted for legislation to limit
damages that can be assessed in civil lawsuits. In doing so, he
took on not just the Clinton administration but also trial lawyers,
who are among the Democrats' biggest contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Lieberman's friends said he had no alternative but to
take this position because it was the one favored by the insurance
industry. The industry is important to Connecticut's economy and
has donated generously to Lieberman's campaigns over the years.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not Lieberman's explanation for his stand. At a news
conference last year, he said the American system of civil law had
``gone way off track and become a lottery in which literally a few
people do very well but most of the people injured don't really get
adequately compensated.''
</P>
<P>
   His vote in 1996 in favor of overhauling the welfare system lost
him friends among liberal Democrats. And his consistent support of
international trade measures like the North American Free Trade
Agreement and favorable trade relations with China runs against the
views of organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, on other issues of primary importance to the
unions like increases in the minimum wage and prohibitions against
employers' hiring permanent replacements for striking workers,
Lieberman has taken labor's side.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career in Congress, Lieberman has voted for
proposals to overhaul the campaign finance system. Most recently,
he supported legislation that would ban unregulated gifts to
political parties, known as soft money, a position also backed by
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans tried Monday to portray Lieberman as less than 100
percent in favor of abortion rights. They produced a letter he
wrote to a constituent in 1989 suggesting that he favored a
requirement that parents of a minor be notified before an abortion
could be performed.
</P>
<P>
   But the organizations here that favor abortion rights said
Lieberman had never wavered in his votes on abortion, and the
National Right to Life Committee put out a statement criticizing
Lieberman's record across the board.
</P>
<P>
   On national security issues, Lieberman has regularly voted
against efforts to reduce the military budget and has supported
submarines and aircraft built at least in part by the many military
contractors in Connecticut. Until the Clinton administration took
office, Lieberman favored cutting funds for the Star Wars missile
defense system, but recently he was one of the first Democrats to
endorse deployment of such a system as soon as it was
technologically realistic.
</P>
<P>
   The one time he challenged the Clinton administration on a major
foreign policy matter was in 1995, when he and Sen. Bob Dole,
R-Kan., co-sponsored legislation requiring the president to break
the U.N. embargo on sending arms to Bosnia.

COHEN DELAYS HIS FINDING ON BUILDING MISSILE RADAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Alaska)   By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Defense Secretary William Cohen postponed his
recommendation Monday to President Clinton on whether to proceed
with a limited national missile defense, citing ``a number of
difficult issues'' that still have to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, who had been widely expected to make his recommendation
to the White House this week, did not specify the reasons for the
delay of at least a month.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the Pentagon and its Ballistic Missile Defense
Organization had not reached a consensus on critical aspects of the
program to build the anti-missile system. Those aspects, discussed
in a flurry of meetings at the Pentagon in the last week, include
the costs of building the system, the building schedule and the
need for new tests, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Components of the Department of Defense are currently
completing their assessment of the program to develop a national
missile defense system,'' Cohen said in a statement released Monday
afternoon. ``A number of difficult issues remain to be resolved
before they can report to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said there was ``no immediate or artificial deadline for a
recommendation to the president,'' even though administration
officials had previously indicated that Clinton would make his
decision this summer or in the early fall.
</P>
<P>
   At best, the postponement compresses the time left for Clinton
to decide whether to continue with the system. It also means that
he could be faced with a decision in the middle of a presidential
election in which building a missile defense has emerged as a
divisive issue. Cohen noted in his statement that ``the president
fully supports this approach,'' referring to the postponement.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen and other officials had indicated that the administration
could begin work on the system _ clearing ground in Alaska to build
an advanced radar station _ without violating the Anti-ballistic
Missile Treaty of 1972, the agreement between the United States and
the former Soviet Union that prohibited national missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
   That would leave the final decision on building the system _
with or without the agreement of the Russians _ until next year,
when a new administration will take office.
</P>
<P>
   To meet the Pentagon's schedule for building a system by 2005, a
decision to award contracts has to be made this fall for work to
begin in the spring at the radar site, on a remote island in the
Aleutians, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's recommendation has been complicated by the failure of a
crucial test of the system last month, the officials said. In that
test, a high-speed ``kill vehicle'' that was supposed to have
intercepted a dummy warhead in space failed to separate from its
booster rocket. The Ballistic Missile Defense Organization has
attributed the failure to an error in the rocket's ``databus,''
which transmits signals to the the warhead, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The officials played down the failure, saying it was caused by
relatively old technology in the booster rockets that was not
essential to the defensive system that the Pentagon was designing.
Still, the failure denied the Pentagon critical information about
the feasibility of the system that, one official said, could make
it more difficult to argue for moving ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The part of the test that followed'' the error ``would have
been useful,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The next test, scheduled for November, will almost certainly be
postponed as officials make adjustments after the last failure.
</P>
<P>
   In June, even before the failure of the test, an independent
panel led by a retired Air Force general, Larry D. Welch, found
that the proposed system was technologically feasible against an
unsophisticated threat. The panel also recommended that additional
tests be conducted before putting any system in the field.
</P>
<P>
   One administration official said senior Pentagon and Ballistic
Missile Defense Organization officials were divided over the need
for more tests. Another official said delays in developing the new
booster rockets for the system could also affect its deployment.
</P>
<P>
   Several officials said they still expected Cohen to recommend
moving ahead with the first steps of the system this year, keeping
it on schedule for 2005, the year by which, intelligence officials
said, North Korea could build a ballistic missile capable of
hitting the United States.
</P>
<P>
   One senior official said, however, that the date for putting a
system into operation could still be pushed back.

QUANCE-JULIAN: MOM WITH A MISSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Kristine Quance-Julian is back to exorcise her
poltergeist.
</P>
<P>
   Her mere presence at the Indiana University-Purdue University
Natatorium is a show of spunk. It's like Roberto De Vicenzo
returning to the Masters after an incorrectly signed scorecard cost
him a victory in 1968, or Farrah Fawcett revisiting David Letterman
after her rambling wreck of an appearance on his late-night talk
show.
</P>
<P>
   When the curtain rises Wednesday on the 2000 U.S. Olympic
Swimming Trials, all eyes will be on Quance-Julian as the Granada
Hills High product attempts to secure one of two spots to Sydney in
the 400-meter individual medley.
</P>
<P>
   In the same event, in the same pool, at the same meet in 1996,
Quance-Julian was dubiously stripped of her best shot at Olympic
immortality when she was disqualified in the preliminaries for an
illegal backstroke-to-breaststroke turn.
</P>
<P>
   She would go on to qualify for her first Olympics in the 100
breaststroke, the 200 individual medley and the 400 medley relay.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't the same. The 400 IM, you see, was Quance-Julian's
best event, the one she felt she owned. It was her baby.
</P>
<P>
   And then she had a child.
</P>
<P>
   Trenton Jeffrey Julian's birth on Dec. 9, 1998, changed
everything.
</P>
<P>
   And nothing. In the water, Quance-Julian hasn't lost the steely
gaze that could freeze a wave. Her voice was as steady as an
assassin's trigger finger the other day when she said, ``I do think
about what happened in the 400 IM (at the last Trials), especially
lately. I find myself thinking that this is my chance to redeem
myself. I just want to make it extra special somehow.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of the water is where Quance-Julian is different. She is
softer, more well-rounded, all grown-up.
</P>
<P>
   The swimming world, which long has celebrated tunnel vision and
teddy bear-toting kewpie dolls, doesn't know what to make of a
competitor who carries her baby around for good luck. For every
person who wishes her well, Quance-Julian says, there are more who
whisper about how she is deluded, a darkhorse, done.
</P>
<P>
   Quance-Julian, who married Jeff Julian _ himself a former
world-class swimmer _ in 1998, doesn't care.
</P>
<P>
   Win or lose on Wednesday, ``I really feel like my life is so
much healthier,'' she said. ``I'm not so single-minded. I'm not so
selfish. Before, my world revolved around me and my swimming. Now
after practice, I can't wait to run home and be with my family.''
</P>
<P>
   At 25, Quance-Julian has arrived at a place not enough coaches
or swimmers get to. Should she earn a berth to Sydney, she will
score a major victory for a balanced life over an obsessed one.
</P>
<P>
   That's reason enough to root for her. Then there's this: Should
she earn a berth to Sydney, Quance-Julian will have the distinction
of being the first female swimmer from the U.S. to qualify for an
Olympic team in an event longer than 100 meters after having a
child.
</P>
<P>
   There's a reason it never has been done before. It's difficult,
juggling the demands of a baby and the training an endurance event
such as the 400 IM demands. It'd be impossible if Quance-Julian
weren't part of the new breed of swimmers who can stay afloat
financially through sponsorships and cash races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had such a hard time between the toll training takes on
my body and coming home and being a mom and wife,'' said
Quance-Julian, whose coach at Trojan Swim Club, Mark Schubert, also
likes her chances of making the Olympic team in the 200 IM and 200
butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   She freely admits she wouldn't have made it this far without her
husband, whom she met at USC. Jeff Julian quit his job as a
financial analyst last year so he could stay home and take care of
Trenton.
</P>
<P>
   He takes care of Kristine, too; one day recently when her racing
times were slow and her spirits were low, she came home to find a
bouquet of roses waiting for her. On the card, Jeff had written,
``Remember to stop and smell the roses.''
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, it didn't matter to Quance-Julian that she has
been feeling oddly nervous at meets recently, ``like I'm 14 years
old,'' she said, ``and at my first nationals again.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter that Trenton sometimes gets confused and calls
Jeff ``Mommy.''
</P>
<P>
   Quance-Julian looked at those roses and got her focus back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trenton is such a joy,'' she said. ``I had one of the girls on
my team ask me, `How can you not smile when you look at him? How
can you ever be unhappy about anything when he smiles at you?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The answer, Quance-Julian is happy to report, is you can't. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: WEST ALWAYS A DEADEYE ON TALENT, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   By IRA BERKOW    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   During a round of golf in the summer of 1995, Jerry West and
Rick Pitino were discussing a kid who was going into his senior
year in high school in Pennsylvania. Pitino, then coach of
Kentucky, said he was determined to recruit the kid. West, the
executive vice president of the Los Angeles Lakers, said: ``Forget
about it, Rick. He's going pro right out of high school. And we're
going to get him.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike today, star high school basketball players then were not
often considering the direct jump to the National Basketball
Association. ``C'mon, Jerry, he'll go to college for a year or two
at least, to get experience,'' Pitino said. West disagreed, saying,
``Not only will he go pro right away, but he's going to be one of
the greatest players in the history of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino recalled: ``I thought Kobe Bryant would probably be an
NBA player one day. And maybe even excel. But at that time, to
think he'd be one of the best of all time was quite a leap. But
West saw something that I didn't see, and that many others didn't
see. But that's Jerry West.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Jerry West have an eye for the basket, as one of
the greatest players in the history of the game, but he also had a
remarkable eye for talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved to scout,'' said Jerry Krause, general manager of the
Chicago Bulls. ``I'd be there with him on the road, and it's late
at night and you're watching your fourth, your fifth, your sixth
game of the day. I've never known a great ex-player who was a great
general manager _ who would spend that kind of time at details _
other than Jerry West. He just had a passion for building a team,
and he was also a master of the salary cap. Remember, the trade he
made with Vancouver, two expensive players for two draft choices,
opened up the cap so he could afford Shaquille O'Neal.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Jerry West, age 62 _ who, over two decades, was the
architect of numerous Laker championship teams, from Kareem and
Magic to O'Neal and that young first-team NBA player, Kobe Bryant _
has announced that he is retiring.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, as he said Monday, it's just time for him to be
``unburdened of the pressures.'' Maybe he indeed was just burned
out; it had reached the point where he couldn't sit through Laker
home games but had to pace about in an exit ramp. In the Lakers'
final game last June which gave them the NBA title, he motored
along the freeways and had a friend telephone him with updates on
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, as some have speculated, the new coach, Phil Jackson, has
gained more control of the team than makes West comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as others contend, West felt that that Jerry Buss, the
Lakers' owner, had never shown sufficient respect for his
achievements by offering him a piece of the team. At this last
championship celebration in Los Angeles, West, for whatever reason,
was conspicuous by his absence. (After 40 distinguished years in an
organization, one may cut him slack on a snit.)
</P>
<P>
   But for many, the image of West the executive fades to West the
player. The first time I saw him in person, in Chicago Stadium in
1958, he was an all-American with West Virginia. Despite a cast
covering a broken (nonshooting) left wrist, his sweet-as-marmalade
jumpers and knifelike drives staggered a superb Northwestern team.
</P>
<P>
   Krause recalled the 1965 playoff series between Baltimore _
Krause was then a Bullets executive _ and Los Angeles: ``The Lakers
were Elgin Baylor, West and three other average guys. Baylor got
hurt after five minutes of the first game and missed the rest of
the series. West took it upon himself to carry the team. He was
unbelievable.'' West, who averaged 31 points a game during the
regular season, averaged 46 in that series, scoring 49, 52, 44, 48,
43, and 42 points as the Lakers beat the Bullets in six games.
</P>
<P>
   Off the court, West was invariably candid and thoughtful, and,
it seemed, always wore the same size fedora regardless of his
accomplishments. Near the end of the 1974 season, West announced
his retirement as a player. ``I've enjoyed the camaraderie of
teammates, and I'll miss that a lot,'' he told me then. ``But right
now I feel like just going somewhere where there is no basketball
and there is no coach running my life. But I'll probably miss the
hell out of that, too, after about a week.''
</P>
<P>
   In one respect, though, West will still be around. The NBA logo
of the graceful dribbler silhouetted in red, white and blue was
taken from a long-ago photo of West. For those of us who have
enjoyed Jerry West in his various careers, we hope, as he reckoned
26 years ago, that he'll be back in basketball in a week.

HERTZ RAISES RATES AND OTHERS FOLLOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, August 13)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Car rental rates jumped last month, with Hertz taking the first
step and the other national companies following immediately. Hertz,
usually the industry pacesetter, announced a $3 daily increase for
noncorporate renters, effective July 14. The weekly rate for cars
reserved 21 days in advance rose $10, and the weekly rate for
reservations made at shorter range generally went up $20. Lauren E.
Garvey, a spokeswoman, said that rises in vehicle prices, wages and
interest rates required the increases, although the company had
record earnings for the most recent quarter.
</P>
<P>
   A week's rental of a midsize Ford in Orlando, Fla., Garvey said,
will cost $271.99 before taxes, up from $261.99, with a reservation
made 21 days ahead. The same rental at La Guardia Airport in New
York will be $489.99 before taxes instead of $469.99, regardless of
reservation time.
</P>
<P>
   Avis said it was matching the rates, as did Budget and Dollar.  &QL;

   SEA CARNIVORES MOVE IN AT LAS VEGAS CASINO  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An aquarium featuring some of the most feared predators of the
sea _ venomous tropical fish, carnivorous water monitors and 10
species of shark _ recently opened at the Mandalay Bay Resort and
Casino in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The Shark Reef at Mandalay Bay is constructed to resemble the
ruins of an ancient temple sinking into the sea. A path winds
through the temple's courtyard and gradually descends, to suggest
that the visitor is going underwater.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen exhibits range from a touch tank of small stingrays and
horseshoe crabs to a display of moon jellyfish. A
1.3-million-gallon tank features the largest sharks, including
nurse sharks that reach 12 feet. Staff members in scuba gear have
an underwater communication system that lets them answer questions
from visitors as they work.
</P>
<P>
   The 105,000-square-foot aquarium was developed in conjunction
with the Vancouver Aquarium Marine Science Center in Vancouver,
British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino is at 3950 Las Vegas
Boulevard South, Las Vegas, Nev., (877) 632-7400. The Shark Reef is
open daily 10 a.m. to 11 p.m. Admission is $12.95, $9.95 ages 12
and under; 5 and under are free.

   OPEN DOORS TO HONOR JEWISH HERITAGE
</P>
<P>
   Jewish sites in 16 European countries will simultaneously open
their doors to the public on Sept. 3 for a European Day of Jewish
Culture, in recognition of Jewish heritage as an integral part of
European tradition.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The list includes about 300 sites, including synagogues,
cemeteries, ritual baths, museums and medieval ghettos in Austria,
Belgium, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic,
France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Spain,
Switzerland and Britain. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Italy alone, sites in nearly 40 towns and cities will be
open, as will more than two dozen synagogues and Jewish cemeteries
in the Alsace-Lorraine region of France.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Concerts, lectures, performances, guided tours, exhibitions and
other events are also planned. These range from a Jewish book fair
in Bologna to concerts of Sephardic Jewish music and Jewish food
tastings in Girona and Toledo, Spain, to publication of a new
brochure on local Jewish history in Bratislava. In Florence, the
Italian Culture Minister Giovanna Melandri is to attend a ceremony
formally inaugurating restoration of the ornate synagogue and
Jewish museum at Via Farini, 4.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many of the sites on display date back centuries. Some, like the
Old Jewish Cemetery in Prague, and the two medieval synagogues in
Toledo, are world famous. Others, like the 18th-century synagogue
in Pfaffenhoffen, France, are used as Jewish museums. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But most, including the baroque synagogues in Carmagnola and
other towns in Italy's Piedmont region, are generally closed to
public access, little known or out of use.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The initiative is coordinated by the European Council of Jewish
Communities (www.ecjc.org), the Strasbourg-based Agency for the
Development of Tourism of the Bas-Rhin
(www.sdv.fr/judaisme/journee/europ/3sept.htm), B'nai B'rith Europe
(www.bnaibrith-europe.org/program.html), and the Red de Juderias de
Espana (www.redjuderias.org), based in Girona. (Note that some of
these sites do not yet list the full program.)
</P>
<P>
   The Council of Europe has included it as part of its campaign
promoting ``Europe, a Common Heritage.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The event is an expansion of an Open Doors to Jewish Heritage
program initiated in Alsace in 1996, which has grown each year
since then. &QL;

JEWS VOICE PRIDE IN SELECTION OF LIEBERMAN
</HEADLINE>
   (See GORE-LIEBERMAN and related stories) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Regardless of political leanings or depth of spirituality,
American Jews expressed great pride on Monday that one of their
own, Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, had been picked by Vice
President Al Gore to be his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   They were proud, they said, not only that a Jew had made it for
the first time into the highest echelons of U.S. politics. Their
pride was also in America itself, for having reached a point that
it could accept the possibility of a Jew _ and an Orthodox Jew at
that _ being a proverbial heartbeat from the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reflects a coming of age and maturity, both for American
Jewry and our political system,'' said Gary Rosenblatt, editor of
The Jewish Week, a newspaper based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   For some Jews, pride was tempered by concern that having a Jew
in a position of such prominence might trigger an anti-Semitic
backlash or, at the least, feelings of unease among other
Americans. Indeed, political chat rooms on the Internet focused on
the Lieberman designation all day on Monday, and many of the
comments were rawly anti-Semitic.
</P>
<P>
   By 6 p.m., an America Online message board set up to discuss
Lieberman had received more than 14,000 postings, compared with
2,000 messages received on a similar board created after Dick
Cheney was named the Republican vice-presidential nominee. At times
on Monday, anti-Semitic slurs and other offensive language made up
half the conversations.
</P>
<P>
   But many Jews, including the leaders of major Jewish groups,
said that, while anti-Semitism remains an inescapable fact of life,
it is waning in this country and has been pushed far from the
political and social mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Ismar Schorsch, chancellor of the Jewish Theological
Seminary in Manhattan, called Gore's selection of Lieberman ``a
historic step forward in the complete integration of Jews in
American society.'' But Schorsch added that it was perhaps an
inevitable step, given the fact that Jews were already highly
visible in the upper reaches of American life, from corporate
boardrooms to the U.S. Senate and even the president's Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this nomination just confirms the status of Jews in
American society,'' he said. ``It's not a breakthrough. It's a
confirmation.''
</P>
<P>
   And it is a development, he and others said, that will
ultimately benefit members of all minority groups whose presence on
the national tickets of the major political parties had been
virtually unthinkable until now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very special day not only for the Jewish people,'' said
Elie Wiesel, winner of the 1986 Nobel Peace Prize and chronicler of
the Holocaust. ``Now the political system is open to all men and
women, of all ethnic origins.''
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, perhaps, there were expressions of uncertainty about
a Jew's rising so close to the top. This concern is often summed up
in a question that is, at once, self-mocking and sincere: is it
good for the Jews? After enduring centuries of hostility and
oppression, many Jews are not totally comforted by their latter-day
success and remain uneasy when co-religionists reach positions of
influence and power.
</P>
<P>
   This attitude was reflected in the comments Monday of Shlomo
Singer, 33, who lives in the Borough Park section of Brooklyn, a
neighborhood of New York City inhabited largely by Hasidic Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Jews are too visible, it's bad news,'' Singer said. ``The
Jews have to remember that they're in a diaspora and that they have
no business running politics.''
</P>
<P>
   To some degree, attitudes like that are ``sort of hard-wired
into our system, for better or worse,'' said Rabbi Avi Shafran,
director of public affairs for Agudath Israel of America, an
Orthodox group based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``But at the same time, it is leavened with pride,'' he said,
and other agreed with him that feelings of apprehension are not
nearly as strong, or as widely held, as they used to be.
</P>
<P>
   To the contrary, some Jewish leaders saw Lieberman's ascension
as an opportunity to show Americans that Orthodox Judaism is a
diverse world and not solely the province of bearded men in black
caftans.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the campaign, I'd be very surprised if the
picture of the Orthodox Jew, active in his religion but also very
much part of this world, hasn't been elevated in the eyes of
Americans.'' said Dr. Mandell I. Ganchrow, president of the Union
of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all Jews were delighted by the Lieberman appointment. Among
them was Rabbi Michael Lerner, editor of Tikkun, a liberal magazine
on Jewish affairs. ``Rather than championing dramatic escalations
in spending for social purposes and to end poverty and oppression,
he will champion defense spending,'' Lerner said.
</P>
<P>
   On the Jewish right, many disapprove of the senator's support of
abortion choice and gay rights, and are unhappy that he has not
supported calls for freeing Jonathan J. Pollard, the American Jew
serving a life prison sentence for spying for Israel.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, the dominant feeling among Jews was that they
had arrived. ``For everything there is a time,'' said Abraham
Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League, ``and this
is the time for a Joe Lieberman.''

 &HT;    Florida Democrats: Lieberman is `outstanding' choice
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ South Florida's Jewish Democrats, who
already vote in large numbers, are likely to come out even stronger
because of the ``great excitement'' about having a Jewish running
mate for Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut will join Gore in
Nashville today for the formal announcement of the new Democratic
presidential ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Joe Lieberman is an outstanding selection,'' said
Florida Sen. Bob Graham, who is vacationing in Wyoming and was
among those being considered for the number two slot by Gore.
Supporters of Florida's senior senator said that while disappointed
that Graham's was not chosen, Gore's decision was ``a bold one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a fantastic choice,'' said Attorney General Bob
Butterworth who is Gore's state campaign chairman and Graham's top
cheerleader. ``Sen. Lieberman is going to be very strong in South
Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   Monte Friedkin, a major contributor to Jewish causes and
chairman of the Palm Beach County Democratic Party said ``phones
are ringing off the hook. There is great excitement in the Jewish
community.''
</P>
<P>
   While Republicans have made gains with both groups, Jewish and
black voters are among the Democratic Party's most loyal
supporters. Florida Democrats had been counting on Graham to help
push Gore over the top here in November, but now they believe
Lieberman will be cause enough excitement to get the job done.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will help us not only with Gore but Lieberman will help
with congressional races and all the way down the ballot,'' said
Bob Poe, chairman of the Florida Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Poe believes that an increased Jewish voter turnout could be
especially helpful to Jewish state Rep. Elaine Bloom of Miami Beach
who is running an uphill congressional race against Republican
incumbent U.S. Rep. E. Clay Shaw of Fort Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never had anyone at this level of politics,'' said
Friedkin of the 58-year old Lieberman. ``I thought Gore wouldn't do
it. It's a gutsy move.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time a person's religion was an issue on the national
ticket was when Catholic John F. Kennedy ran for president in 1960.
He had to convince certain segments of suspicious voters that he
would not be beholden to the Pope.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 21st Century we ought to be talking about people's
records and not their religion,'' said Butterworth.
</P>
<P>
   Said Friedkin, ``It will certainly wake-up the anti-Semite crowd
but they weren't going to vote for Democrats anyway.''

MARINERS TAKE THIRD STRAIGHT FROM YANKEES, 8-5 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Seattle manager, Lou Piniella, stepped from the
visitors' dugout before the National Anthem Monday, made eye
contact with his counterpart across the field and dramatically
doffed his cap and bent a knee in respectful tribute. Yankee
Manager Joe Torre and his staff responded in kind.
</P>
<P>
   Those might be the last acts of civility between teams possibly
heading for a playoff showdown. The Mariners whipped the Yankees,
8-5, in spite of four home runs by the Yankees on a hot and swampy
afternoon, and exchanged knockdown pitches before departing Yankee
Stadium with three straight victories in the four-game series.
</P>
<P>
   It was a cranky day for the Yankees, all things considered:
After reliever Jeff Nelson was ejected for offering an opinion on
the work of home plate umpire Mark Carlson, Chuck Knoblauch, the
Yankees' lead-off hitter, was placed on the 15-day disabled list
with an elbow injury that may or may not improve this season. The
Yankees made a small deal for the backup infielder Luis Sojo,
trading the minor league pitcher Chris Spurling to the Pittsburgh
Pirates, and a larger acquisition in claiming the slugger Jose
Canseco on waivers.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch, on the disabled list for the first time in his
10-year career, initially hurt his right elbow making an awkward
throw against Baltimore July 24. Knoblauch's condition has not
improved, and he was given a dye test Monday, which club officials
said confirmed an earlier diagnosis of inflammation. Knoblauch
mentioned on Sunday that he has a tear.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the exact nature of the injury, it could have
serious consequences for the Yankees. Knoblauch has been a crucial
member of the team, in spite of his throwing jitters, because he is
such an effective leadoff hitter. The Yankees hope his condition
can improve to the point that he can throw and play second base
again. ``Hopefully, he can continue,'' said Brian Cashman, the
Yankees' general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch can still hit, in spite of his elbow trouble, and if
he can't play second base, then Torre might consider using him as
the designated hitter. Until Knoblauch returns -- possibly the
first week of September -- then Jose Vizcaino will play second and
share the leadoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter led off Monday, and the Yankees took a 1-0 lead in
the second inning when David Justice hit his 28th homer; he added
another two innings later. But in the top of the sixth inning, with
Seattle leading, 3-2, the Mariners rallied against Denny Neagle.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs and runners at first and second, Neagle got ahead
of Rickey Henderson, no balls and two strikes. But Neagle
eventually walked Henderson - his critical mistake, Neagle would
say later. The bases were loaded, the count went to three balls and
two strikes on Carlos Guillen, and Neagle tried zipping a fastball
over the outside corner.
</P>
<P>
   The right-handed hitting Guillen poked the ball toward right
field. Neagle was sure it was an easy fly to right fielder Paul
O'Neill. But O'Neill ran toward the wall, hit the fence and watched
Guillen's drive ride a swirling wind into the stands, just over the
314-foot sign in the right field corner. Grand slam. Yankee Stadium
usually will be a friend to Neagle, a fly ball pitcher, but this
time it hurt him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime anybody wraps something around the pole, there's
really not a whole lot you can do about it,'' said Torre.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Grimsley relieved Neagle and nailed Edgar Martinez with a
fastball, and Piniella patrolled the Seattle dugout, talking aloud.
When Justice came to bat in the bottom of the sixth inning,
Mariners pitcher John Halama threw a fastball behind Justice, clear
retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pitch got away from him,'' Piniella said later. ``Although
Edgar did get hit the previous inning.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Halama: ``Whatever Lou said stands for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice said later he understood what Halama was trying to do,
and had no problem with that. But Justice did turn and ask the
umpire, Carlson, if he was going to give a warning to Halama, and
became somewhat animated when Carlson said no. Before the next
pitch, Justice stepped far back in the box, in anticipation of
another brushback that never came.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Justice was called out on strikes twice on pitches
that appeared to be out of the strike zone. Justice never said
Carlson retaliated for Justice's arguments, but it was apparent he
felt that way. ``Y'all got TV,'' Justice said. ``Y'all saw it.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenallen Hill and Jorge Posada also hit home runs - too little,
on a frustrating afternoon for the Yankees.

BAIL REDUCED FOR MAN ACCUSED OF LEADING PHILADELPHIA PROTESTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A man accused of being the ringleader of the illegal street
protests during the Republican National Convention had his bail
reduced from $1 million to $100,000 on Monday, as defendants
contended that the Philadelphia police were guilty of jailhouse
brutality and city officials maintained there was a criminal
conspiracy to shut down the city.
</P>
<P>
   During an appeal hearing, the million-dollar bail on misdemeanor
charges was ruled excessive for John Sellers, the 33-year-old
leader of the Ruckus Society of Berkeley, Calif. He denies leading
a conspiracy and insists that he only trained demonstrators in the
techniques of nonviolent civil disobedience.
</P>
<P>
   At the same hearing, Common Pleas Judge Lisa A. Richette
rejected a request for bail reduction for about 150 defendants
still in jail who are protesting their arrests by refusing to give
their identities to city authorities. Most of the defendants are
charged with misdemeanors, with bail of $20,000 or less. They would
probably be released with no bail once they properly identified
themselves, said the district attorney, Lynne M. Abraham.
</P>
<P>
   As more defendants from a total of 391 arrested returned to
freedom with complaints about their detention conditions, the
American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania cited ``credible
stories concerning serious injuries inflicted'' in jail, and urged
anyone who was injured to file complaints with the city Police
Advisory Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Frankel, executive director of the ACLU, accused city
authorities of overreacting to the provocations and relatively
petty crimes of some demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that vandalizing property, turning over trash cans,
assaulting persons and shutting down the city by blocking traffic
are not activities protected by the First Amendment,'' Frankel
said, summarizing the main street incidents that occurred last
Tuesday. ``However, they are not the kind of crimes that justify
treating the defendants as if they were dangerous urban
terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   The main demonstration group, R2K Network, protests the
``corruption of democracy'' through the power of Wall Street and
the globalized economy. R2K leaders accuse the city of
``criminalizing dissent'' by pre-emptively arresting some
protesters and seeking high bail, amounting to preventive
detention. R2K members noted that some of the same demonstrators
arrested in April in Washington during a similar protest were
eventually fined $5 for jaywalking.
</P>
<P>
   A network organizer, Beka Economopoulos, said some defendants
had been brutalized, denied medication and ``hog tied''
ankle-to-wrist in jail.
</P>
<P>
   The police denied the accusations and said defendants were
creating their own problems by offering fanciful identities,
staging hunger strikes and, in some cases, stripping off their
clothes to hinder identification from videotaped street protests.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor John F. Street has accused the protesters of ``a very
well-thought-out, well-planned conspiracy to shut down the city.''
And the police commissioner, John P. Timoney, maintained that
protest leaders had far more than nonviolent dissent in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call them conspirators and criminals and cowards,'' he said
on Friday in detailing some charges, including what he said was the
stringing of piano wire across Market Street in an attempt to
injure police officers on horseback and bicycles.
</P>
<P>
   The gravity of that charge was conceded in an interview by
Bradley Bridge, an assistant legal aid lawyer with the city's
Defender Association. But Bridge complained that 70 defendants were
being held for a far less suspicious incident _ being present in a
factory raided by the police where street puppets and other protest
materials were made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was there negotiating and saw the puppets,'' Bridge said.
``It's appalling those guys are still in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials contended that, with the police widely praised
for exercising restraint during the protests, the demonstrators
were deprived of bloody encounters and now sought to create an
issue with allegations of jailhouse brutality.
</P>
<P>
   Protest leaders argued that the city was bent on detaining
defendants beyond the Democratic National Convention next week in
Los Angeles. But they vowed that demonstrations planned for that
convention would be stronger because of the arrests in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   With bail appeals continuing, the court did not reduce the
$500,000 bail set for Darby Landy, 20, who is accused of a felony
assault on the police in a street fracas with bicycling officers
led by Timoney.

JULIE KRONE INDUCTED INTO RACING'S HALL OF FAME 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE DRAPE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ Julie Krone began in Michigan as a
barefoot 5-year-old bareback aboard Stony Baloney, whom she called
her Wonder Pony. As an 18-year-old, she hopped a fence at Tampa Bay
Downs to take out her first jockey license. She won riding titles
in New Jersey and Florida, and 119 stakes races in every important
hub of horse racing, and became the first and only female jockey to
win a Triple Crown event when she coaxed Colonial Affair home in
the 1993 Belmont Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   None of it came easily. Krone had to convince owners that a
woman possessed the physical strength to handle a 1,000-pound
thoroughbred and the mental ballast to recognize and take
opportunities at 35 miles an hour. There were scrapes with male
jocks and two bone-jarring spills that could have snuffed out her
career.
</P>
<P>
   Now 37 and retired, the 4-foot-11-inch Krone faced one more
obstacle before she became the first woman to be inducted into the
National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. She overcame that, too,
by stepping up on a milk carton to reach the microphone on the
podium to deliver her acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could put everyone single one of you on the back of a
horse at the one-eighth pole,'' she said, ``so you could have the
feeling of communicating with an animal you love so much. I got to
do that every day of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   She entered the Hall of Fame in impeccable company. The sport's
great past was invoked by the welcoming of the 1956 Kentucky Derby
winner, Needles. The museum's historic review committee also
announced that Tom Smith, the trainer who campaigned Seabiscuit in
the 1930s, was elected posthumously to the Hall of Fame and would
be inducted next August. Racing's current glory was reflected in
the inductions of the trainer Neil Drysdale and his horse A.P.
Indy, as well as of Winning Colors, who became only the third filly
to win the Kentucky Derby in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale was presented by Peggy Whittingham, the widow of the
Hall of Fame trainer Charlie Whittingham, whom he had apprenticed
under before going out on his own to train five champions,
including A.P. Indy, and guiding Fusaichi Pegasus to victory in
this year's Kentucky Derby. The 52-year-old Drysdale, a native of
Britain, conservative and concise, offered a brief but poignant
acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``My career would not be possible without a very forgiving
clientele tolerating me, and a very understanding and loyal
staff,'' he said. ``But most of all, these lovely four-legged
creatures that have given my life such passion.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Krone was the most galvanizing inductee in the class,
prompting much discussion in the racing community over whether she
had the statistical heft to deserve election. She amassed an
accomplished record, winning 3,545 races _ or 17 percent of her
mounts _ for earnings of $81.8 million, which are records for
female jockeys. But the rider she beat on the ballot, Earlie Fires,
for example, won more than 6,000 races, and current riders in the
Hall Of Fame like Jerry Bailey and Pat Day have won more than 4,600
and 7,600 races, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   But the trainers who trusted Krone on horses have been the most
vocal about her worthiness. She won the Belmont aboard Colonial
Affair for Scotty Schulhofer, giving them both their first victory
in a Triple Crown race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little leery about her being a girl,'' Schulhofer
conceded. ``But when I saw her on a horse for me firsthand, I could
see she was a great little horsewoman. She's got great finesse,
beautiful hands on a horse, and good communication. You don't have
to bully a horse _ just talk to him.''
</P>
<P>
   As her loud and warm ovation demonstrated, Krone is beloved
throughout racing for her effervescent personality and high-pitched
voice. In her heartfelt and often rambling speech, she told how the
Hall of Fame rider Angel Cordero Jr. used to tease her about how
she patiently waited on a horse until the stretch and one furious
run. Cordero would compare her to Day. From atop the milk crate,
she mimed the laid-back seat she would take on a horse and chirped,
``Angel used to say that if me and Pat Day had a baby, we'd go to
give it a bottle of milk and that baby would say, `No, no, you have
to wait an hour.'''
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Krone was the nation's third-leading jockey with 368
victories and was in demand as a rider. If not for two serious
spills, she might still be piling up numbers today. In 1993, on the
last day of the Saratoga meet, she shattered her ankle after being
tossed to the turf by the filly Seattle Way. She returned nine
months later, but she was more fragile of body and mind. In 1995,
she had finger surgery after an accident at Gulfstream Park in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   This time her rehabilitation also encompassed counseling and
prescription medication after post-traumatic stress disorder was
diagnosed. Krone returned to racing in 1997 and rode well at
Monmouth Park, but she decided in 1999 that injuries had diminished
her skills and eroded her determination.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing better than getting a second chance and coming
back and doing it right,'' she acknowledged, thanking the trainers
like Jonathan Sheppard, who presented her here, who had stuck with
her.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Krone shrugged off the second-guessing of her Hall of
Fame status. She pulled on the lapel of her blue blazer with the
Hall of Fame insignia. ``Go cast a net over 500 people in the
grandstand and see what they say,'' she said. ``From the personal
response I have received, I think most people believe I belong.''
</P>
<P>
   FINISH LINES
</P>
<P>
   The trainer Neil Drysdale said the Kentucky Derby winner
Fusaichi Pegasus has been kept in racing shape with continual
gallops, while his owners try to negotiation a stallion deal. He
said Fusaichi Pegasus, the 3-year-old son of Prospector, would race
again, but didn't say which races he would run in the fall. ... The
New York-bred Turnofthecentury held off the late charge of Aldo to
capture the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame Handicap on
Monday. The gray colt paid $9.80 for a $2 bet to win and earned a
$90,000 purse for the owners Barry K. Schwartz and Eugene Hauman. &QL;

 &HT;    Rivalry growing between ports of Charleston and Savannah
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ The Cooper River shimmers in the stifling
heat, a reflection of the rising rivalry between South Carolina's
major port here and its smaller competitor in Savannah.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, Savannah nabbed from Charleston a portion of its
Asian container business from Maersk Sealand, the world's largest
shipping line.
</P>
<P>
   Maersk's container ships now call on Charleston nine times a
week, rather than 10. That 10th vessel instead goes to Savannah,
delivering merchandise from Asia to the distribution centers of
retailers including Wal-Mart Stores and Home Depot.
</P>
<P>
   Maersk officials say they are testing Savannah, with a far
greater stake to be decided over the next year. The shipping line
is evaluating whether to leave its South Atlantic hub in
Charleston, or move part or all of the multibillion-dollar business
to Savannah.
</P>
<P>
   The competition for Maersk's hub goes beyond Southern bragging
rights. It's a test of both ports' abilities to handle ever-larger
volumes of containers, crucial for the facilities' long-term
prosperity and the strength of their respective states' economies.
</P>
<P>
   Any significant gain of Maersk's business would be a coup for
the port of Savannah, which handles a little more than half the
container freight volume as Charleston.
</P>
<P>
   But some environmentalists worry that Maersk is playing the two
ports against one another to pressure Charleston and Savannah to
deepen their navigational channels, which the shipping line has
said will be a key factor in its decision. Environmentalists say
that could harm wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international shipping lines are using their economic
leverage to try to force all of the ports to expand and to deepen
their channels, at taxpayers' expense,'' said Trip Van Noppen, a
lawyer with the Southern Environmental Law Center in Chapel Hill,
N.C. ``Maersk is the clearest example of this.''
</P>
<P>
   After spurring a bidding war two years ago from Norfolk, Va., to
Halifax, Nova Scotia, Maersk decided to keep its North Atlantic hub
at the New York and New Jersey ports. Those ports agreed to pay for
at least $1.6 billion in infrastructure projects over the next 27
years.
</P>
<P>
   Maersk says it is responding to a simple demand of the brutally
competitive global shipping business: It needs deeper channels in
Charleston and Savannah to accommodate its increasingly large
ships. In some cases, vessels must wait for high tide to call on
the two ports.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the ports do not have enough water, they are limiting our
ability to bring in the big ships already on the high seas,'' said
Nick Taro, vice president of Universal Maritime Services, the
Maersk arm that oversees the line's East Coast and Gulf Coast
business. ``We are not able to maximize our assets.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year Charleston ranked as the nation's third-largest
container port, and Savannah ranked ninth. Buoyed by the strong
Southeastern economy, both recently completed record years in
shipments of 20-foot-long and 40-foot-long containers distributed
by trains and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   In another victory last month for the Georgia Ports Authority,
Evergreen, the world's second-largest container shipper, selected
Savannah over Charleston for a new service to Asia, also involving
52 ships each year.
</P>
<P>
   Taro said Maersk, in the early stages of its evaluation, may
decide to divide its South Atlantic business between Charleston and
Savannah.
</P>
<P>
   The ports authorities of South Carolina and Georgia are spending
heavily on equipment such as cranes and on expansions to speed the
transfer of containers from ships to trucks and rail cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the (shipping) lines come, they want a berth on demand, a
crane on demand,'' said Byron Hock, the Georgia Ports Authority's
director of trade development. ``They do not want to wait.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more controversial is the deepening of the navigational
channels in Savannah and Charleston.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is in the midst of deepening
the Charleston Harbor channel from 40 feet to 45 feet. After that
project is completed in the next two to three years, South
Carolina's ports authority may start what promises to be the
complex, contentious process of deepening the channel to 50 feet or
more, said Chief Executive Bernard Groseclose.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the proposed deepening of the Savannah River's
navigational channel from 42 feet to 48 feet has received
congressional authorization, with the condition that the estimated
$230 million project win approval from federal agencies such as the
Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional funding for the Savannah River deepening would
come afterward, possibly two years or more from now. But it faces a
legal challenge.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the Southern Environmental Law Center filed a federal
suit on behalf of four conservation groups challenging the proposed
deepening. According to the suit, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
did not adequately evaulate the project's environmental impact
before issuing a favorable report to Congress.

CONSULTANTS SEEN AS WINNERS OVER ACCOUNTANTS IN ANDERSEN RULING

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ending one of corporate America's bitterest family
feuds, an international arbitrator cleaved the world's largest
consulting firm from the world's largest accounting firm on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling frees Andersen Consulting, with 65,000 employees,
from its parent company, which now consists entirely of Arthur
Andersen, a tax and auditing firm with 77,000 employees. In
exchange, Andersen Consulting will have to give up its name and pay
Arthur Andersen $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the decision, which ends a three-year battle that
had distracted the sprawling company, was a major victory for the
consultants. Hours after it was announced, the chief executive of
Arthur Andersen resigned.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of dispute was the same thing that has ended
hundreds of other partnerships: money. Over the last decade, as
Andersen Consulting became more profitable than the firm that had
founded it, the consultants began to chafe over sharing some of
their profits with the accountants. The frustration exploded into
an arbitration filing in 1997, with the consultants accusing the
accountants of violating an internal agreement by setting up their
own consulting unit and competing for the same clients.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's announcement _ made in Paris by the International Court
of Arbitration, which appointed a Colombian lawyer to oversee the
case _ separates the businesses immediately. Since 1989, the
partnerships have operated under one umbrella company called
Andersen Worldwide, but in recent years they have had as little to
do with each other as possible. As traumatic as the rift has been
for the partners, clients of both firms have remained largely
shielded from it, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   After the ruling, Andersen Consulting partners said they were
elated, largely because they had split off their division without
having to pay any of the $14.6 billion in damages that Arthur
Andersen had sought. The payment of $1 billion, most of which is
already in an escrow account, covers past profit-sharing fees that
Andersen Consulting refused to pay while the arbitration was in
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a morning of celebration and euphoria here,'' Joe
Forehand, Andersen Consulting's chief executive, said at the start
of a conference call with analysts and reporters Monday. The ruling
could add about $200,000 to the annual pay of each of Andersen's
1,200 partners.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Andersen's chief executive, Jim Wadia, said his fellow
partners were happy with the ruling and that he would resign
because, having been appointed three years ago largely to oversee
the dispute, his work was done. In an interview, he called the
decision a ``7 to 7.5'' on a scale of 1 to 10.
</P>
<P>
   The arbitrator, Guillermo Gamba, ruled that Arthur Andersen did
not breach the 1989 agreement by setting up its own consulting unit
and that Andersen Consulting may not use an internal computer
system designed by Arthur Andersen in the 1970s and 1980s. Gamba
instead blamed Andersen Worldwide, a bare-bones bureaucracy in
Geneva, for not assuring cooperation between the two units, as the
pact said it would.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts still called the decision surprisingly favorable
for the consulting unit. They said that Wadia had turned down a
settlement offer a few years ago that would have given the firm
more money than the ruling does, while sparing it years of
acrimony. Wadia ``is not going to be very popular with the Arthur
Andersen partners,'' said Wayne Cooper, the president of Kennedy
Information, which follows the consulting business.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge win for Andersen Consulting,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the decision formally separated the businesses,
nastiness continued between partners who had built a business
together and still ride the same elevators in a midtown Manhattan
building where employees of both firms work. Executives of the two
firms spent hours Monday dismissing _ sometimes vulgarly _ the
other side's analysis as misleading or simply false.
</P>
<P>
   Wadia, a British citizen, said he would take particular pleasure
in Andersen Consulting's having to remove a large sign displaying
its logo in the British Airways terminal of Kennedy International
Airport. ``The way I look at it, that's mine,'' he said, referring
to the Andersen name.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Andersen Consulting's lead lawyer scoffed at the
rival firm's opinion that the ruling was essentially a split
decision. ``These guys just spin endlessly,'' said Barry R.
Ostrager, a partner at Simpson Thacher and Bartlett.
</P>
<P>
   Though the roots of the case are internal, the ruling is the
latest example of the separation of consulting units from
accounting firms. Such splits have come as the Securities and
Exchange Commission has proposed restricting firms from selling
advice to companies they also audit. In February, Ernst &AMP; Young
sold its consulting business to Cap Gemini SA, and
PricewaterhouseCoopers and KPMG Peat Marwick are also moving to
shed their consulting units.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The splits, however, leave accounting firms with the challenge
of thriving without their fastest-growing units. The consolidation
of companies from the automobile industry to the packaged-food
industry has left accountants with fewer potential clients. At the
same time, accountants have found themselves the subject of an
increasing amount of litigation over aggressive bookkeeping methods
used by companies desperate to meet their profit targets in a
volatile stock market, said David F. Larcker, an accounting
professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike its rivals, Arthur Andersen will get virtually nothing in
return for its consulting unit. ``That practice could easily be
worth more than $10 billion,'' Larcker said. Ernst &AMP; Young, with a
consulting business about half the size of Andersen Consulting's,
received the equivalent of $11.1 billion from Cap Gemini.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Andersen also risks losing some of its 1,700 partners,
Cooper said, because they face a pay cut. Under the 1989 pact
setting up the semi-autonomous consulting unit, the more profitable
of the two divisions had to pay as much as 15 percent of profits to
the other. In recent years, the figure has been more than $200
million, and Arthur Andersen has been on the receiving end.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen Consulting will face its own set of difficulties, even
if analysts said they were less intimidating. Last year, the firm's
revenue grew by 8 percent, far below its typical rate in recent
years and half the industry average in 1999, according to Kennedy
Information. In response, Andersen Consulting is trying to shift
its focus from installing computer systems to designing Internet
strategies for both its traditional large clients and small
start-ups. It has also created a venture-capital division and begun
to take equity stakes in clients in exchange for lower fees.
</P>
<P>
   Now, just two years after launching a $100 million marketing
campaign to promote a new logo, the firm must spend another $100
million, by its own estimate, to make its new name well known. The
task is made easier, however, because the firm's customers are a
relatively small cadre of business executives rather than millions
of consumers, said Clive Chajet, chairman of Chajet Consulting, a
brand-identity concern in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Forehand said he and his partners had not yet decided on a new
name and would hire their regular advertising firm, Young &AMP;
Rubicam, for the project. Analysts said they expected the firm to
pick a name that evoked technology, and might even drop the word
``consulting.'' Forehand said he did not expect the firm to use the
dot-com suffix.
</P>
<P>
   Gamba, the arbitrator, barred the firm from ``using the
`Andersen' name or any derivative thereof,'' presumably preventing
it from adopting ``AC,'' which forms the crux of the logo designed
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen Consulting's partners voted unanimously in December
1997 to sever ties with Arthur Andersen. The 1989 agreement, known
as the Florida accord, called for any party leaving the partnership
to pay a breakup fee equal to 150 percent of its annual revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Andersen Consulting had sales of $8.9 billion, and
Arthur Andersen brought in $7.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The consultants contended in the arbitration case that the
contract was void because Arthur Andersen's consulting unit had
begun to pitch its services to all types of companies, rather than
just the small and medium-sized ones that the pact said it could
pursue. At the arbitration hearing in New York this year, the
consultants introduced as evidence a video in which Arthur
Andersen's top consultant praised his colleagues in 1995 for having
``winked and nodded'' at the ``arbitrary restriction.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1989 agreement called for the arbitration court, a part of
the International Chamber of Commerce, to settle disputes. It then
had to choose an arbitrator from a country in which neither the
consulting firm nor the accounting firm did business, leaving it a
list of eight nations that included Iraq, Somalia, the Sudan and
Colombia.

<P>
   AQABA TO JERUSALEM
</P>
<P>
   Q. We will arrive in Aqaba, Jordan, in November and plan to
spend a couple of days in Petra and possibly Amman and then go to
Jerusalem. What's the best way to arrange for transportation,
lodgings and a private guide?
</P>
<P>
   _ B.P., Bellport, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. Tours in Jordan usually include a few additional stops at
places of historic significance beyond the ones you mention. The
itinerary may vary, but the operators consulted _ Absolute Asia,
Isram World of Travel and Petra Moon _ said they could meet
travelers' needs. Here's a glimpse of the standard itinerary.
</P>
<P>
   A private car picks you up in Aqaba for a journey of about an
hour to Wadi Rum, where you hop aboard a Jeep for a two-hour
exploration of the pastel desertscape that was the setting of the
exploits of Lawrence of Arabia. You then travel about another hour
to Petra, staying the night (and the second night) at the
Moevenpick Petra.
</P>
<P>
   On Day 2 a guide takes you from near the Petra Forum Hotel on
horseback or foot (a walk of about 10 minutes) to the entrance to
the Siq, a winding, mile-long defile. At its end stand the imposing
Treasury and other sandstone monuments of Petra, a Nabatean city
dating from the fourth century B.C. (One can no longer ride through
the Siq itself.)
</P>
<P>
   The route on the third and fourth days depends on the tour
operator. On Day 3, Isram and Petra Moon take you along the King's
Highway, making several stops: Kerak, site of a 12th-century
Crusader castle; Madaba, where the glorious mosaics include the
oldest extant map of the Holy Land, dating to the sixth century and
found in the Greek Orthodox Church of St. George; Mount Nebo, from
which Moses is believed to have viewed the promised land; and,
finally, Amman, at the Grand Hyatt.
</P>
<P>
   On Day 4, the Isram and Petra Moon tours go to Jerash and Ajloun
and then leave you at the King Hussein Bridge, known across the
border, in Israel, as the Allenby Bridge. Jerash is a remarkably
well-preserved Greek-Roman city with a grand gateway built to honor
the Emperor Hadrian's arrival in A.D. 129, as well as temples,
baths and colonnaded streets. Ajloun is the site of a Crusader
castle.
</P>
<P>
   The Absolute Asia schedule for Day 3 lists Jerash (but you can
also request to see nearby Kerak) and a tour of Amman, where the
day's last stop is the Grand Hyatt. On the next day you visit
Madaba, Mount Nebo and the Hussein Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   As for the border formalities: To enter Jordan, you need a visa,
which costs $45. You can download an application from
www.jordanembassyus &QC; .org/visapage.htm. There's a consulate at 866
Second Ave., New York, N.Y. 10017; (212) 832-0119, fax (212)
832-5346. To enter Israel, you need only a United States passport.
</P>
<P>
   Here are details on the cost of the tours. Transportation,
lodgings and admission fees are included (except where noted) and
charges are per person, based on double occupancy.
</P>
<P>
   Absolute Asia, 180 Varick St., New York, N.Y. 10014; (800)

   BY CANAL IN FRANCE
</P>
<P>
   Q. We are planning to travel in France from Avignon to Bordeaux
by river boat and canal barges on the Canal du Rhone et Sete, the
Canal du Midi and the Canal Lateral a la Garonne. What companies or
agencies can help us chart our course? _ Leonard W. Frey, Memphis  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. What makes your proposed trip complicated is that no single
company operates passenger boats on all the canals you mention.
Covering the 300-mile route, which sets out essentially from the
Mediterranean and goes almost as far as the Bay of Biscay, should
take about four weeks. One reason for the slow pace is the many
locks (about 135, depending on the route).
</P>
<P>
   The season runs from April through October, and arrangements
should be made well in advance.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the companies that can meet your needs are the Barge Lady,
a broker for crewed boats, and Le Boat, which charters self-drive
and crewed boats. Both point out that four weeks is an unusually
long trip; one to two weeks is more common. But it's your vacation,
of course.
</P>
<P>
   The Barge Lady is at 101 West Grand Ave., Chicago, Ill. 60610;
(800) 880-0071 or (312) 245-0900, fax (312) 245-0952;
bargelady.com. ``The boats will be of varying quality, from first
class to deluxe,'' according to Ellen Sack, owner of the company.
There will be no more than 12 passengers, she said, and the charge
includes three meals and sightseeing every day, all wines and open
bar. The cost? ``Very roughly'' $13,000 a person, based on double
occupancy, Sack said.
</P>
<P>
   The trip, she said, comprises four legs of six nights each: From
Avignon to Beziers, from Beziers to Carcassonne, from Carcassonne
to Toulouse and from Toulouse to Agen, outside Bordeaux.
</P>
<P>
   Le Boat is at 45 Whitney Rd., Mahwah, N.J. 07430; (800) 992-0291
or (201) 560-1941, fax (201) 560-1945; www.leboat.com. Your trip
will require three boats, according to Evelyn Gresser, founder of
Le Boat. Noting that no self-drive boats are based in Avignon, she
suggested starting in St.-Gilles, which is 15 miles south of
Beaucaire, and going to Port Cassafieres. That, she said, allows
one to visit some of the medieval towns in Provence.
</P>
<P>
   The second leg is from Port Cassafieres, past Carcassonne, to
Castelnaurdry. Changing boats for the third and last time, you
travel the 137-mile stretch to Le Mas d'Agenais, 60 miles from
Bordeaux. One can travel a bit farther west, but because of strong
currents self-drive boats can't get closer to Bordeaux, Gresser
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cost is dictated by season and boat size. Assuming a four-week
trip, the charge for April 15 to May 5 and Sept. 22 to Oct. 5 is
$5,256 for a two-passenger boat and $8,136 for a four. From July 8
to Aug. 17, it is $7,056 for a two-passenger boat and $11,160 for a
four. The starting date of your trip determines the rate for the
entire cruise.

SHOPLIFTING TO ORDER INCREASES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla., Va., Ill.)   By GUY TREBAY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tossed on a bed in a Brooklyn apartment were a $600
Vuitton Broadway satchel, two $600 burgundy quilted polyester nylon
skirts from Chanel, a $545 scarf with the block-lettered Chanel
logo worked into the weave and two pairs of blunt-toed $425 Prada
Nero shoes for men. None of the garments matched. But that did not
matter. The apartment was a way station on a convoluted
distribution route, and the clothes did not yet have owners.
Unless, you count the retailers they were stolen from.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are going right out to Manhattan,'' said Angie E., a
transgendered person who pilfers clothing for a living. The
apartment is hers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use this fence in the diamond district,'' E said. ``There's
two brothers. They're the ones that sell it. I just mop the stuff
and get my little cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Mopping, or shoplifting, is no new development on the retail
scene. But large-scale shoplifting of luxury goods to order may be.
Although criminal law does not distinguish between shoplifting and
other kinds of larceny, law enforcement officials say that theft to
order of luxury brands appears to be a growth sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going for the upscale stores,'' said Joe Morrash, a
detective assigned to a stolen-property task force with the
Alexandria, Va., police. ``They're stealing in volume and selling
to fences and underground boutiques.'' At one drab single-family
home in Queens County, Morrash said, the New York police uncovered
over $500,000 in stolen clothes in 1998. ``The inside looked like
Macy's,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Macy's isn't the only target of enterprising thieves. As label
culture signals social arrival, even crooks are getting into the
act. ``It's a society where everybody's got their Fendi and their
Chanel and their Vuitton,'' said Gerald Dupree, 39, a Brooklyn
maintenance worker who said he left a career as a semiprofessional
shoplifter when he broke a longtime heroin habit four years ago.
``You've got to keep pace.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a breathtaking pace. In a survey conducted by the
University of Florida, retail ``shrinkage'' _ as shoplifting is
euphemistically called in the business _ was shown to have caused
losses exceeding $8.9 billion in 1997, the last year for which
figures are available.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, police officials say, an increasing number of
semiorganized crime syndicates, many of them South American, have
been operating along the Eastern Seaboard, in urban centers and at
upscale suburban malls. ``It's not normal shoplifting anymore,
where they're stealing one or two items,'' said Andrew McColl, a
Washington-based agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who
heads a task force on property crime. ``They're going for the
leather coats, the luxury items. The last arrest we made at Tysons
Corner mall here, they had $100,000 in goods.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not hard to imagine running up a total like that when you
consider the tagged prices of goods the thieves are now after.
``You can order a Chanel suit in size 10, and there are people who
can mop it and fences who have the goods,'' Dupree said. Such suits
typically cost around $4,000.
</P>
<P>
   Angie E. is a thief whose audacity has led her, by her own
account, to steal satchels from Louis Vuitton, baguettes bags from
Fendi, shoes from Prada and scarves from Hermes, goods that are
often kept in glass cases or under lock and key. She is, as Dupree
said, ``one of the ever-famous fierce girdle bandits of New York,''
a term referring to the practice of stuffing stolen goods into
underclothes. ``One thief I know put a whole mink in a girdle,''
Dupree asserted. Another, he said, would ``go into a jewelry
counter and, you know how they have chains hanging on display
racks?'' He paused. ``She could just lift the chains up all at once
and drop them down her sleeves.''
</P>
<P>
   At Saks Fifth Avenue last week a salesman said, ``If you don't
nail it down, they're going to take it.'' He was recounting an
episode in July, when a woman grabbed six $200 Coach bags from a
counter near the main Fifth Avenue exit and bolted. Although the
bags were equipped with acoustomagnetic sensors, designed to
trigger an alarm, that did not serve as a deterrent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think they care about the sensors?'' asked the
salesman, who, like most of the retailers I interviewed, did not
want to be identified. ``They're in, they're out, it's fast. Who's
going to chase them for the bags? The bags are insured.''
</P>
<P>
   The subject of shoplifting is an abiding taboo. Only one of a
dozen luxury store managers in Manhattan I spoke to would consent
to discuss shrinkage on the record. The response of Ellen
Hopfinger, manager of the Versace store on Fifth Avenue, was
typical. ``It's not something we would ever talk about,'' Hopfinger
said. ``I used to work at another luxury store, Armani, and no one
talks about it, ever.''
</P>
<P>
   The reasons are various, explained Bruce Van Kleek, a member of
the Loss Prevention Advisory Council at the National Retail
Federation. ``It points to internal problems, high turnover, people
coming and going all the time,'' he said. Public admissions about
shoplifting problems can also, of course, give potential thieves a
heads up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sick that you have to write about these things,'' said
Stephanie Greenfield, a retailer who attributes a low level of
shrinkage at her two Scoop stores in Manhattan to security guards
posted at every entrance. Still, she said: ``It's going to happen.
Look at the economy. Everybody wants stuff. I don't think it's only
people who can't afford it. I think there's a prejudice that people
don't steal on all class levels, all income levels. There's a
mistake people make only looking at one type of crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Kleek added that shoplifters ``come in all shapes and sizes,
from the 10-year-old stealing a comic book to sophisticated
criminal gangs.''
</P>
<P>
   The innovation, Morrash said, is that inroads are being made on
the luxury goods trade by professional gangs with greater levels of
sophistication and taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``The South Americans are only doing upscale stores now,'' he
said. ``The Limited, Nordstrom, Lord &AMP; Taylor, Bloomingdale's.''
</P>
<P>
   Goods obtained by one Chilean syndicate, the Washington police
reported, were later used to stock a ``legitimate'' Los Angeles
boutique. ``We had six guys who'd stolen $150,000 in three days,''
Morrash said. ``They move around the major cities like L.A., New
York, Washington and Chicago.''
</P>
<P>
   They rent hotel rooms and getaway cars. They use sophisticated
signaling methods to rake designer clothes into bags. One group
compiled a manual for ``contractors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Never wander around with any of the pieces you are planning to
take,'' read a copy of these guidelines that I obtained, ``because
not only will the salespeople want to help you or hold them for you
or put them in a dressing room for you, all of which defeat your
purpose, but it gives security a chance to count how many you
have.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time an alarm sounds, most professional thieves are gone.
In Manhattan particularly, where shoppers are made uneasy by
excessive security and surveillance, shoplifters often have
preferred exits from their favorite stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Madison Avenue side of Barney's,'' E. said, citing an
example ``The Fifth Avenue entrance to Saks. I did a job at
Pink's,'' the London shirtmaker with a branch on Madison Avenue and
53rd Street. ``They had $165 Sea Island shirts and a side door with
nobody around,'' she said. ``I got six. Everybody's always
complaining that they can't find anyone to wait on them. I say:
`Thank you. Let's keep it that way.'''
</P>
<P>
   An assistant manager at Pink, who would not give his name,
responded, ``That's sad, but that's New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Shoplifters have been known to line shopping bags with foil or
duct tape to thwart sensors. But Van Kleek of the retail federation
said that the spate of successful theft owed less to cunning than
to new levels of brazenness.
</P>
<P>
   It is a view that Dupree, the former thief, confirmed. The
secret of success, he said, is a formula that rings of business
motivational seminars: ``You go in there thinking, `This is mine
and I'm taking it with me.'''

BOTH PARTIES PLAN TO EMPTY WALLETS TO DRAW VOTERS TO POLLS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Both the Republican and Democratic parties say they
plan to spend record amounts of money on get-out-the-vote
operations this fall, showing that both sides expect the battle for
the White House and Congress to be so tight that slight changes in
voter turnout could carry the day.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Republican National Committee said they
expected to spend $100 million on television advertising, phone
banks, literature and a host of other activities intended to sway
independent voters and energize core Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Party leaders said they expected to spend half that
amount _ enough, they asserted, to match what they described as a
less experienced and less efficient Republican operation.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have traditionally focused more on advertising
campaigns than on voter turnout operations, leaving much of that
gritty trench work to religious conservatives, like the Christian
Coalition, or single-issue groups, like the National Rifle
Association.
</P>
<P>
   So their sharper focus on grass-roots organizing this year
indicates a significant shift in strategy in an effort to win the
election on what has long been Democratic turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to reinvigorate the party itself,'' said Terry
Holt, a spokesman for Victory 2000, a branch of the Republican
National Committee that will be coordinating the voter turnout
effort in all states.
</P>
<P>
   But Democratic officials asserted that the Republicans, for all
their money, were coming late to the war on the ground and would
have little time to build effective operations.
</P>
<P>
   They also suggested that the Republicans were creating their own
grass-roots operations because conservative groups usually aligned
with the Republicans, like the Christian Coalition, have lost much
of their potency. And they argued that undecided swing voters would
be more receptive to the Democratic message.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason Democrats have been winning is because we energize
voters on issues like Social Security, education and health care,''
said Michael Whouley, the senior strategy adviser for the
Democratic National Committee and Vice President Al Gore's
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can spend as much money as possible, but it will be like
the Wizard of Oz,'' Whouley said. ``It's a lot of blue smoke and
mirrors. But when you pull back the curtains, there aren't any
issues that will turn out voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Meyer, chairman of Victory 2000, said the $100 million
goal, which was first reported in The Washington Post on Monday,
would be 50 percent more than the Republicans spent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He estimated that $75 million of that money would be split
evenly between television issue advertisements and voter-turnout
operations, which include polls, phone banks, yard signs and
mailings. The group will also be training organizers to work in the
most competitive states.
</P>
<P>
   An additional $13.7 million would be used to defray
administrative costs for the Bush campaign. And the rest of the pot
would go toward miscellaneous Victory 2000 costs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the $100 million, which will be raised by the
Republican National Committee, Meyer said, state Victory 2000
committees would raise at least $50 million more for the
voter-turnout campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer _ a former chairman of the Texas Republican State
Committee and a close ally of the Republican nominee, Gov. George
W. Bush _ said one goal of the grass-roots campaign would be to
identify undecided voters who are leaning toward Bush and then
aggressively urge them to vote, using follow-up phone calls,
mailings and personal visits. He said similar efforts in Texas had
swayed large blocs of undecided voters to Bush during his first
campaign, in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats are planning to depend heavily on the AFL-CIO to
do much of the heavy work of energizing Democratic voters, as they
have in the past. Labor officials have budgeted $46 million for
political activities in 1999 and 2000, the bulk of which will be
spent on voter education and turnout activities in this fall's
national elections.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Rosenthal, political director for the federation, said
that unions would be trying to replicate their successes of the
1996 and 1998, when they increased union participation by building
old-fashioned ward and precinct systems in closely contested
Congressional districts. The federation plans to focus its efforts
on 71 Congressional districts in 25 states, Rosenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key for us is the personal contact,'' he said. ``We are
filling a void that parties used to fill. And it's been working.''
</P>
<P>
   The alliance of Democrats and labor is expected to be
strengthened this week, when it is anticipated that the United Auto
Workers will endorse Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats are also building get-out-the-vote operations in
African-American and Latino communities. Donna Brazile, Gore's
campaign manager, said that Democratic organizers would try to
``touch'' likely voters in those communities _ with mailings, phone
calls or personal contact _ dozens of times before Election Day.
Similar campaigns were highly successful in the 1996 and 1998
elections.

INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES SEE GREATER CHANCE OF INDIA-PAKISTAN NUCLEAR
CONFLICT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: 2nd take will move by 9:30 p.m. ET.) 
 By JUDITH MILLER and JAMES RISEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Behind President Clinton's blunt warning last spring that South
Asia was the world's most perilous region lay an assessment from
American intelligence agencies that the likelihood of a war between
India and Pakistan that could erupt into a nuclear conflict had
increased significantly, according to officials with access to the
secret intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that the CIA and the nation's other
intelligence organizations had reached their consensus after
examining the nuclear capacities of both countries and the growing
tensions between them, in particular over the disputed Himalayan
territory of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   The assessment, known as a National Intelligence Estimate, began
late last summer after Pakistan-backed militants crossed over the
high mountain peaks of Kashmir into the Indian-controlled area of
Kargil, setting off weeks of heavy fighting that included
airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, the administration grew fearful that the conflict
could escalate into a nuclear exchange, officials said, citing both
states' relatively poor intelligence about each other's intentions
and movements and their lack of direct communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kargil episode really got everyone's attention,'' said
George Perkovich, deputy director of the W. Alton Jones Foundation
and the author of ``India's Nuclear Bomb,'' published last year by
the University of California.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts who took part in drafting the assessment said
the report had succeeded in underscoring the importance of working
to ease political tensions between two rivals that have fought
three wars in the 50 years since their independence. In the past,
the administration had focused mainly on trying to stop the
development and spread of nuclear weapons on the subcontinent.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, for instance, Clinton talked by telephone with Prime
Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee of India, who is due on a state visit
next month, said Sandy Berger, the national security adviser.
Berger added that he himself talks with Pakistan's military leader,
Gen. Pervez Musharraf, as part of the dialog with Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton received the intelligence assessment shortly before his
first visit to South Asia in March. And he clearly reflected the
report's conclusions when he twice called the Indian subcontinent
``the most dangerous place in the world.'' India's president
scolded Clinton and called the description ``alarmist.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Kargil episode, the assessment, which remains secret,
concluded that there was a sharply increased chance of a nonnuclear
military conflict between India and Pakistan, possibly erupting
into a nuclear exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The chances of such a nonnuclear conflict, one White House
official said, were put in the ``50-50 range.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The likelihood of a nuclear conflict goes up and down,'' said
another official. ``It's less important to assign a probability to
it than to warn senior officials that there is a serious threat
here that demands immediate and focused attention and action.''
</P>
<P>
   The assessment contained no specific guidance on what the
administration could do to reduce tensions, according to those
familiar with the document. But Clinton and other top officials
have urged senior Indian and Pakistani officials in public and
private meetings to open a direct political dialogue and give up
their nuclear programs, warning them of the growing peril of an
accidental or deliberate nuclear exchange.

LIEBERMAN ANNOUNCEMENT IS AIMED AT STEALING REPUBLICAN THUNDER 
</HEADLINE>
  (See GORE-LIEBERMAN and related stories) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like a select number of other journalists covering the Gore
campaign, Claire Shipman of NBC News received the official word on
Monday about Sen. Joseph Lieberman's selection as Vice President Al
Gore's the running mate before even Lieberman did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the calls at 4:30 a.m., and we put together a package at
5 a.m.,'' said Shipman, who added that she had been working the
phones for days. ``The deal was I was going to use it at 7 a.m. and
not before.''
</P>
<P>
   At a few minutes to 7, Katie Couric, the co-host of ``Today,''
offered a tease about the news that would be elucidated at the top
of the hour. The Associated Press put out an urgent bulletin, and
the Gore campaign was off on a fast break with its hottest news day
in months. By 7:01 or thereabouts, every major network and a
variety of news-oriented Web sites were buzzing over Gore's choice
of Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat, as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, was by no means an accident. In the wake of a
Republican convention as tightly choreographed as a modern ballet,
the Democrats were answering with a political announcement as
finely plotted as a three-act whodunit. The aim, Democratic
officials said, was to quell the post-convention Republican thunder
by a pre-emptory saturation of news pages, Web sites and airwaves
with the choice of Lieberman, a selection that allowed commentators
to use words like ``bold'' and ``historic.''
</P>
<P>
   It was all part of an effort to make a big splash going into the
Democratic convention next week, and to draw vivid contrasts
between the ways in which Gore and Gov. George W. Bush picked their
running mates _ as if to put forth the selection process as a
metaphor for the kinds of administrations they would preside over.
Aides to Gore were quick to point out that Bush's choice of Dick
Cheney leaked out so haphazardly that the Bush campaign was made to
look indecisive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to throw out information in a very controlled,
businesslike fashion,'' said an official in the Gore campaign,
``while they lost control of the process very early on.''
</P>
<P>
   A commentator on MSNBC's ``Equal Time,'' Paul Begala, a former
speechwriter and adviser to President Clinton, said that in an age
when the press and the public try to deconstruct every television
image, ``process is often message.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A big part of Gore's message is that he is experienced and
intelligent,'' Begala added. ``Nothing could prove it better than
the way he handled this. He kept his own counsel, then he made his
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   It was no accident, either, that the news was spread by the
campaign 32 hours in advance of the formal declaration by Gore at a
rally on Tuesday in downtown Nashville that was to include a
performance by the pop singer Jewel. The idea was to turn the news
conference into something like political infotainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're getting coverage all day today, all day tomorrow and
getting a lot of coverage probably on Wednesday and Thursday,'' the
Gore campaign official said. ``The pick is a historic pick, and you
want to leverage something like this as much as you can.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, having served as defense secretary during the Persian
Gulf war, has a higher public profile than Lieberman, whom the
Democrats essentially will have to introduce to a large percentage
of American voters. Gore campaign aides said they needed to make
sure that they got the first shot at ``defining'' Lieberman for the
public.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, close advisers to Gore spent the wee hours on
Monday lining up prominent Democrats to speak for Lieberman on
morning and daytime news programs. Among those recruited were Sens.
John B. Breaux of Louisiana, Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, Frank
R. Lautenberg of New Jersey and one of the others who had been
mentioned for the vice presidential slot, John Edwards of North
Carolina. Former Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York, Eleanor Holmes
Norton, the nonvoting House delegate from the District of Columbia,
and Labor Secretary Alexis Herman also offered their opinions in
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, it's a situation where once the decision is made by
the vice president, you have to be very aggressive to control the
news,'' said another Gore aide.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats have refined their ideas about managing the news
in the years since 1984, when the last groundbreaking nominee,
Geraldine Ferraro, was picked to run with former Vice President
Walter Mondale. That year, said Martin Kaplan, who was Mondale's
chief speechwriter at the time, Ferraro was flown overnight to
Minnesota and appeared with Mondale the next morning, just as the
story broke. The event pretty much spoke for itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the most dramatic moments I've ever been at,''
Kaplan said. ``There were tears in the eyes of some of the Secret
Service people in the chamber.''

LIEBERMAN ON LEWINSKY AFFAIR: EMBARRASSING FOR ALL OF US AS
AMERICANS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a Senate speech on Sept. 3, 1998, Sen. Joseph Lieberman,
D-Conn., sharply criticized President Clinton's conduct in the
Monica Lewinsky matter, but he voted against impeaching the
president, giving his reasons in a statement released on Feb. 11,
1999:
</P>
<P>
   ON CLINTON'S CONDUCT
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, I must respectfully disagree with the president's
contention that his relationship with Monica Lewinsky and the way
in which he misled us about it is nobody's business but his
family's and that even presidents have private lives, as he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he or we think it fair or not, the reality is in 1998
that a president's private life is public.
</P>
<P>
   Contemporary news media standards will have it no other way. And
surely this president was given fair notice of that by the amount
of time the news media has dedicated to investigating his personal
life during the 1992 campaign and in the years since.
</P>
<P>
   But there is more to this than modern media intrusiveness. The
president is not just the elected leader of our country. He is, as
presidential scholar Clinton Rossiter observed, and I quote, ``the
one-man distillation of the American people'' and, as President
Taft said at another time, the personal embodiment and
representative of their dignity and majesty.
</P>
<P>
   So when his personal conduct is embarrassing, it is sadly so not
just for him and his family, it is embarrassing for all of us as
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The president is a role model, and, because of his prominence
and the moral authority that emanates from his office, sets
standards of behavior for the people he serves. ...
</P>
<P>
   So no matter how much the president or others may wish to
compartmentalize the different spheres of his life, the inescapable
truth is that the president's private conduct can, and often does,
have profound public consequences. In this case, the president
apparently had extramarital relations with an employee half his age
and did so in the workplace, in the vicinity of the Oval Office.
Such behavior is not just inappropriate, it is immoral.
</P>
<P>
   And it is harmful, for it sends a message of what is acceptable
behavior to the larger American family, particularly to our
children, which is as influential as the negative messages
communicated by the entertainment culture.
</P>
<P>
   If you doubt that, just ask America's parents about the intimate
and frequently unseemly sexual questions their young children have
been asking them and discussing since the president's relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky became public seven months ago. I have had many
of those conversations with parents, particularly in Connecticut,
and from them I conclude that parents across our country feel much
as I do that something very sad and sordid has happened in American
life when I cannot watch the news on television with my 10-year-old
daughter anymore.
</P>
<P>
   This, unfortunately, is all-too-familiar territory for America's
families in today's anything-goes culture, where sexual promiscuity
is too often treated as just another lifestyle choice with little
risk of adverse consequences.
</P>
<P>
   It is this mind-set that has helped to threaten the stability
and integrity of the family, which continues to be the most
important unit of civilized society, the place where we raise our
children and teach them to be responsible citizens, to develop and
nurture their personal and moral faculties.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, in fact, has shown during the course of his
presidency that he understands this and the broad concern in the
public about the threat to the family. He has used the bully pulpit
of his presidency to eloquently and effectively call for the
renewal of our common values, particularly the principle of
personal responsibility and our common commitment to family. And he
has spoken out admirably against sexual promiscuity among
teen-agers in clear terms of right and wrong, emphasizing the
consequences involved.
</P>
<P>
   Now, all of that makes the president's misconduct so confusing
and so damaging. The president's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky not
only contradicted the values he has publicly embraced over the last
six years, it has, I fear, compromised his moral authority at a
time when Americans of every political persuasion agree that the
decline of the family is one of the most pressing problems we are
facing.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, I believe the president could have lessened the
harm his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky has caused if he had
acknowledged his mistake and spoken with candor about it to the
American people shortly after it became public in January.
</P>
<P>
   But, as we now know, he chose not to do this. This deception is
particularly troubling because it was not just a reflexive, and in
many ways understandable, human act of concealment to protect
himself and his family from what he called the embarrassment of his
own conduct when he was confronted with it in the deposition in the
Jones case. But rather, it was the intentional and premeditated
decision to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing this path, I fear that the president has undercut
the efforts of millions of American parents who are naturally
trying to instill in our children the value of honesty. As most any
mother and father knows, kids have a singular ability to detect
double standards. So we can safely assume that it will be that much
more difficult to convince our sons and daughters of the importance
of telling the truth when the most powerful man in the nation
evades it. Many parents I have spoken with in Connecticut confirm
this unfortunate consequence.
</P>
<P>
   The president's intentional and consistent statements, more
deeply, may also undercut the trust that the American people have
in his word. Under the Constitution, as presidential scholar
Neustadt has noted, the president's ultimate source of authority,
particularly his moral authority, is the power to persuade, to
mobilize public opinion, to build consensus behind a common agenda.
And at this, the president has been extraordinarily effective.
</P>
<P>
   But that power hinges on the president's support among the
American people and their faith and confidence in his motivations
and agenda, yes, but also in his word.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As Teddy Roosevelt once explained, ``My power vanishes into thin
air the instant that my fellow citizens, who are straight and
honest, cease to believe that I represent them and fight for what
is straight and honest.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is all the strength that I have,'' Roosevelt said.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, with his deception, President Clinton may have weakened
the great power and strength that he possesses, of which President
Roosevelt spoke.
</P>
<P>
   I know this is a concern that many of my colleagues share, which
is to say that the president has hurt his credibility and therefore
perhaps his chances of moving his policy agenda forward.
</P>
<P>
   But I believe that the harm the president's actions have caused
extends beyond the political arena. I am afraid that the misconduct
the president has admitted may be reinforcing one of the worst
messages being delivered by our popular culture, which is that
values are fungible. And I am concerned that his misconduct may
help to blur some of the most important bright lines of right and
wrong in our society.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. President, I said at the outset that this was a very
difficult statement to write and deliver. That is true, very true.
And it is true in large part because it is so personal and yet
needs to be public, but also because of my fear that it will appear
unnecessarily judgmental. I truly regret this. ...
</P>
<P>
   We all fall short of the standards our best values set for us.
Certainly I do.
</P>
<P>
   But the president, by virtue of the office he sought and was
elected to, has traditionally been held to a higher standard. This
is as it should be, because the American president, as I quoted
earlier, is not just the one-man distillation of the American
people but today the most powerful person in the world. And as
such, the consequences of his misbehavior, even private
misbehavior, are much greater than that of an average citizen, a
CEO or even a senator.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE IMPEACHMENT VOTE
</P>
<P>
   No matter how deeply disappointed I am that our president, who
has worked so successfully to lift up the lives of so many people,
so lowered himself and his office, I conclude that his wrongdoing
in this sordid saga does not justify making him the first president
to be ousted from office in our history. I will therefore vote
against both articles of impeachment. ...
</P>
<P>
   Although the House managers have left me thoroughly unconvinced
of some of their allegations, the evidence presented on others does
lead me to believe that it is likely that there were occasions on
which the president made false or misleading statements and took
actions which could have had the effect of impeding the discovery
of evidence in judicial proceedings. Whether any of his conduct
constitutes a criminal offense such as perjury or obstruction of
justice is not for me to decide. That, appropriately, should and
must be left to the criminal justice system, which will uphold the
rule of law in President Clinton's case as it would for any other
American.
</P>
<P>
   What I must do is uphold the Constitution and decide whether the
House managers have presented clear and convincing evidence that
the president has committed a high crime or misdemeanor, which is
to say whether they have demonstrated that his misconduct has so
compromised his capacity to govern in the national interest that he
must be removed.
</P>
<P>
   I conclude that the House managers have not met that high
burden.

YANKEES ACQUIRE CANSECO, BUT WHY? 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Yankees wanted Jose Canseco in the past and could
not get him. They finally got him Monday, acquiring the slugger on
waivers, but they don't really want him or need him; they just
wanted to make sure he isn't going to play for somebody else.
</P>
<P>
   Canseco, beset by injuries in his career, is a struggling
36-year-old designated hitter who cannot be used in the outfield
because of defensive deficiencies. Trouble is, the Yankees might
have as many as five players who would be most effectively deployed
as a designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Joe Torre, who gushed over the previous deals for Denny
Neagle and David Justice, was far more reticent about this move.
``I'm a little stunned,'' he said after the Yankees' 8-5 loss to
Seattle Monday afternoon, their third straight defeat. ``I'm a
little surprised. I don't have an opinion one way or another.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre was asked how much Canseco will be used. ``I don't know,''
he responded, without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, said of his
executives: ``I think they got caught up in something they didn't
think about, but I'm behind my people. I'm totally supportive of
what they did. I'm happy the man is coming here, and I'm hoping he
does the job for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, meanwhile, placed second baseman Chuck Knoblauch on
the disabled list because of inflammation in his right elbow,
reacquired the veteran utility infielder Luis Sojo in a trade to
serve as a backup and will take outfielder Ryan Thompson off the
25-man roster. Canseco and Sojo are expected to arrive before
Tuesday night's game against Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the Yankees have added Justice, Neagle,
designated hitter Glenallen Hill, outfielder Luis Polonia,
infielder Jose Vizcaino and pitcher Dwight Gooden. Now they have a
spare part named Canseco. ``I think I can play shortstop, and a
little bit of third base,'' Canseco said. ``I really don't know how
I'm going to fit in there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees paid $20,000 for Canseco, who has 440 career homers,
after claiming him on waivers from the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. The
Yankees will also pay a little less than $1 million in salary for
this season, as well as incentive payments he might soon achieve.
These are the costs for the Yankees' procedural aggressiveness, for
placating the championship obsession of Steinbrenner, who has been
particularly interested in Canseco in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Canseco hammered 46 homers for Toronto in 1998 and 34 homers in
113 games for Tampa Bay last year, in a season cut short by back
surgery, and has not been the same player since. Canseco averaged
one homer for every 14.85 at-bats before the operation. He has
averaged one homer every 26.8 at-bats and a strikeout for every 3.4
at-bats since then.
</P>
<P>
   But he has been a huge star in his controversial career, and
Steinbrenner loves stars. When the Yankees were struggling for
offense in late May, Steinbrenner asked the Yankees' baseball
officials if it would be worthwhile making a trade for Canseco.
Tampa Bay's asking price was high and the Yankees turned elsewhere,
attempting to deal for Juan Gonzalez and Sammy Sosa before
eventually getting Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Spencer wrecked his knee the day before the All-Star Game
break, however, and the Yankees were back in the market for a
right-handed hitter. Before swapping for Hill July 23, General
Manager Brian Cashman called Chuck LaMar, the general manager of
the Devil Rays, and asked if Canseco was available. LaMar repeated
his high demand, and Cashman got Hill, who has been highly
effective in his role, banging 4 homers in 25 at-bats, including a
solo shot in Monday's loss to the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   After the July 31 trade deadline, teams began filling the waiver
wire with players; no player can be traded in August or September
unless he is swapped to the team that makes the claim, or unless he
has cleared waivers. As always, Cashman aggressively placed claims,
some because the Yankees have a genuine interest in a player, and
some because they wanted to prevent players from going to another
team.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay placed Canseco on waivers last Thursday. The order of
waiver claims is based on won-loss records, worst to best, and the
Yankees were 11th among 29 teams, with Oakland, Seattle and the
Chicago White Sox picking behind them. Teams submit waiver claims
on the same day, blindly; there is no way for any team to know if
another team has placed a claim.
</P>
<P>
   So Cashman had to weigh the plusses and minuses of claiming
Canseco. If Cashman passed on Canseco, then there was a chance a
team with a better record could land him or that he could clear
waivers and be traded to a Yankee rival, such as Toronto. If that
happened, Steinbrenner presumably would have been apoplectic.
</P>
<P>
   If Cashman gambled and claimed Canseco, then Tampa Bay could
choose to withdraw Canseco from waivers and keep him, thereby
making it impossible for the Devil Rays to trade him the rest of
the season. The Devil Rays' other option was to simply let the
Yankees keep Canseco. Last year, the Yankees placed a claim on
Chicago's Frank Thomas, and for a couple of days, the White Sox
debated whether to give Thomas, with his huge contract, to the
Yankees before they withdrew him from waivers just before the
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   So Cashman decided to place a claim on Canseco, along with 47
other claims, and on Friday, LaMar called to tell him the Yankees
had the preeminent claim. For two days, the Yankees rebuffed
LaMar's requests to work out a trade, probably in the hope that
LaMar would keep Canseco.
</P>
<P>
   But LaMar called Cashman at 11 a.m. Monday to say he was giving
Canseco to the Yankees. Torre learned about the transaction just
before the start of the game Monday and was surprised. A cameraman
told Derek Jeter about the move just before the start of the game.
Reliever Mike Stanton, a former teammate of Canseco, heard the news
while listening to the game on the radio in the clubhouse, and when
Stanton went to the bullpen in the fifth inning, he told the other
relievers.
</P>
<P>
   Canseco was a controversial figure in the early part of his
career, but he has matured and will not likely threaten the
Yankees' chemistry. But now Torre must figure out a way to utilize
Canseco. The manager's preference is for Justice to be his
designated hitter, to save the wear and tear on his legs _ a
priority, considering that Justice has hit 29 homers this year.
</P>
<P>
   Torre can't use Canseco without playing Justice in the outfield.
He can't play Canseco without benching Hill. In order to make room
for Canseco, the Yankees had to dump Thompson, who is their only
true backup center fielder.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Torre completely diminishes Hill's role, it would seem
Canseco's primary job will be as a pinch-hitter. The Yankees also
have the option of trying to pass Canseco through waivers and
unloading him, and even if Cashman doesn't want Canseco, then he
will at least have the luxury of sending him to a particular
destination. ``We'll see how he does,'' Cashman said. ``He might
wind up playing a key role.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know what Jose Canseco is capable of,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Canseco's salary is $3 million for this year, and he will
receive $175,000 if he reaches 300 plate appearances, $175,000 more
if he reaches 350 plate appearances, $200,000 for 400 plate
appearances and $250,000 for 450 plate appearances. There is a club
option for 2001, at $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Canseco is nearing 300 plate appearances, but may not get many
more, playing for a team that really doesn't want or need him. &QL;

GORE'S GUT FEELING LEAVES EDWARDS, KERRY OFF THE TICKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN AND GLEN JOHNSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE _ The hour was late and Al Gore had been in meetings
since the afternoon, conferring with small groups of advisers who
shuttled in and out of his 10th floor suite at the Loew's
Vanderbilt Plaza Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   With just 36 hours until he was scheduled to parade his running
mate before the world, the question was this: Should he pick North
Carolina Senator John Edwards, Connecticut Senator Joseph
Lieberman, or Massachusetts Senator John F. Kerry?
</P>
<P>
   Kerry, despite his status as one of the finalists, and despite
support from Gore consultants who had worked for Kerry in previous
Massachusetts elections, had fallen off the radar screen by Sunday
night, and was viewed by some in the campaign as too easily
typecast as a liberal, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was less concerned about the liberal tag, sources said, and
was impressed by Kerry's war record and cast of mind. Still little
was said by Gore or any of his advisers about Kerry throughout the
evening, as attention focused on the other two.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it wasn't clear to any on the campaign staff which way
Gore was leaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has totally not made up his mind,'' said one adviser
leaving one of the discussions. ``It's really shocking.''
</P>
<P>
   Also a suprise was Gore's mood. With such a critical choice
looming, and with the entire election potentially at stake, the
vice president was positively chipper as he grilled his advisers on
each of the candidates, cracking jokes and asking for
recommendations around the living room area.
</P>
<P>
   Then, close to midnight, as Gore and his wife, Tipper, were
about to retire to their bedroom, the vice president informed
William M. Daley, his campaign chairman, Warren Christopher, the
head of his search committee, and Frank Hunger, his brother-in-law,
that he wanted Lieberman for his partner on the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to go with my gut,'' Gore told Kerry the next day as he
explained his choice over the telephone, Democratic sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Gore said the vice president hoped to underscore his
own ``New Democrat'' political philosophy with a Democrat
considered to be a centrist and a bridge-builder between the
parties. They also said Gore was most comfortable with Lieberman
personally and excited about making history by selecting the
first-ever Jewish vice presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a single person who had captured the imaginations
of campaign insiders, however, it was Edwards, the young,
charismatic senator who had served less than a year and a half in
public office after a career as a trial attorney.
</P>
<P>
   First elected in 1998, Edwards, 47, had ties to numerous staff
members and political consultants who are now working for Gore.
Those people, including campaign consultants Bob Shrum and Tad
Devine, and David Ginsberg, the campaign research director, all
touted Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also seemed tempted by the idea of tapping someone younger
and fresh to the national scene, someone who had belt his
reputation as a trial lawyer in Raleigh who took on hard cases and
made millions in legal battles ``for the little guy.'' Shrum's
wife, the author Mary Louise Oates, even took Edwards' wife,
Elizabeth, shopping for new clothes on Sunday -- just in case the
call from Gore came.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, however, the vice president did not believe Edwards
was a realistic choice. Edwards' public resume would crowd out
attention to the senator's natural charm, intelligence and ability
to connect on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore's point was, `We know it, but how do we get the country
to know it,' '' said one insider. The source said Gore believed he
would have been betting his entire campaign on how the public and
press responded in the first 48 hours after an Edwards pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody basically wanted him, but realized it was a huge
hurdle,'' said another person in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Missing from the Sunday night meetings was the candidate's most
trusted adviser, his wife Tipper, whose flight from Washington to
Nashville was delayed due to thunderstorms. Shortly after Gore
arrived here from a breakfast fund-raiser in the Hamptons, he spent
an hour and forty-five minutes talking with Christopher, Daley and
Hunger. He then called his wife at the airport and his daughter,
Karenna, in New York City, to provide status reports.
</P>
<P>
   The talks, which took place over soft drinks and bottled water,
resumed when Tipper Gore arrived about 10:30 p.m., said Chris
Lehane, the campaign press secretary. They were free-wheeling,
moving back and forth over the candidates, Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were talking about different people from their own
perspectives -- it was all very positive,'' said one official
inside the meeting. ``There was no, `This is not a good idea
because of this.' ''
</P>
<P>
   For Kerry, the vetting process began three weeks ago, when
Christopher called him to ask him if he would like to proceed to
the next level of scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry agreed and thus began a process that included interviews
with him, his wife, their staffs and friends, as well as the
submission of every legislative bill he had ever filed, every
speech he had made, every book and article he had written _ or had
been written about him.
</P>
<P>
   The senator also met with lawyers from a Washington firm, who
culled through the material and spoke with him for hours over three
occasions. Among the subjects covered were his past use of
marijuana and about his social life when he was a divorcee.
</P>
<P>
   ``They asked a couple of questions from the period when I was
single and I gave them an explanation,'' he said over lunch Monday.
``Three-quarters of the stories that were written when I was single
were not accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry said he also had to submit not only his tax records and
financial information, but that of his wealthy wife. She agreed _
but only after the lawyers pledged confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry finally met with Gore for breakfast early on July 25, the
same day he would host the vice president at his home for a
Democratic party fund-raiser. The pair talked about the job, about
issues and about expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The final Gore deliberations came over a weekend that clearly
wore on Kerry as he jetted from Idaho to Washington to Boston and
back to Washington again. From Saturday through Monday, he wore a
cell phone on his belt, its green light flashing a reminder that he
might be called to serve.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry was still sleeping at 6:52 a.m. Monday when an Associated
Press bulletin announced Lieberman's selection. The news would be
relayed to him through a phone call that jarred him from his sleep.
On the other end of the line was Jeffrey R. Lewis, chief of staff
to Kerry's wife, Teresa Heinz.
</P>
<P>
   The call from Gore did not come until 1:20 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just expressed it was a very personal kind of choice,
expressed admiration and gratitude for my going through this,''
Kerry told reporters after taking Gore's call. ``He asked me to be
involved, and I obviously will continue to be involved.''
</P>
<P>
   One Gore aide noted that Kerry had been a strong candidate. ``He
had a lot of support and a lot of friends, including the vice
president, who was very, very comfortable with him,'' said Tad
Devine, in charge of running the day-to-day campaign operation.
``Absolutely no one felt he wouldn't be up to it or wouldn't do a
great job in that capacity and recognized the obvious strengths he
brought to the table.''
</P>
<P>
   When Kerry's name was on the table, advisers worried that he
would be painted as too far to the left because he represents
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all said he'd be viewed as a liberal, but (Gore) didn't
seem overly concerned,'' said one aide. The vice president, did,
however, like Kerry's service in Vietnam and the possibility of
running an all-veteran ticket against Texas Governor George W. Bush
and Dick Cheney, neither of whom saw active duty during that war.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, Kerry's turn in the national spotlight did not
come to pass.

HOSPITAL PROBING STOLEN PATIENT RECORDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLEMENT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Dana-Farber Cancer Institute will begin notifying
12,000 patients this week that personal information, including
Social Security numbers, may have been stolen from its records and
used fraudulently.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital and law enforcement officials said a major
investigation is under &UR;  &LR; way to determine the extent of the theft
that could leave cancer patients fighting to clear their financial
records.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will do everything in our power to make sure this does not
get in the way of medical care,'' said Dana-Farber chief operating
officer James Conway. ``There is no question.''
</P>
<P>
   One woman patient, who Conway refused to discuss because of
confidentiality laws, is so far the only person authorities say has
been victimized by the identity theft. The patient could not be
reached for comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A temporary Dana-Farber employee, working as a patient intake
worker, allegedly used the patient's name and other data to obtain
$2,500 in long-distance and other telephone service, officials said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But the Boston Police department's Major Case Unit is
investigating the financial and credit histories of several
patients to determine whether the same scheme was used with them,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The woman charged in the alleged scheme had the personal data
for 23 other patients in her pocketbook, according to court
records. A co-worker allegedly found the information at the woman's
home and returned it to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Dana-Farber officials said the records that were allegedly
accessed would typically include a patient's name, Social Security
number, date of birth, next of kin, and health insurance carrier.
Medical records are kept separately and are not involved, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have absolutely no inkling that clinical information was
involved here,'' Conway said.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital and law enforcement officials would not say what
triggered the discovery of the theft. But Conway said the hospital
learned of the problem July 28 and contacted Boston police that
day.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the first suspect in the case, Marlene Honore, was
arraigned in on one count of larceny over $250 for stealing the
$2,500 in telephone service, and one count of identity theft for
allegedly giving a patient's personal data to the telephone company
when it installed a phone line.
</P>
<P>
   Honore pleaded not guilty and bail was set at $500. Her
court-appointed attorney, Gus Sanderson, said in court that Honore
has been assisting the investigation and has shared information
with Boston police.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may very well not have the right person,'' Sanderson
said. Honore is a native of Haiti who is living in the United
States on a green card and lists a Woonsocket, R.I., apartment as
her home address in court records.
</P>
<P>
   Honore worked at the hospital from February until May of this
year, during which time 12,000 patients came to Dana-Farber for
treatment. In letters to patients, Conway said the hospital will
apologize and promise to help patients settle any problems linked
to identity theft.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital will urge patients to check their credit histories
and if they discover a problem they should contact the hospital,
which has hired a firm with expertise in resolving credit history
disputes to assist patients.
</P>
<P>
   Conway said the hospital in January began running criminal
background checks on full-time, non-medical personnel, and began
checking medical personnel in July. Next month the hospital planned
to begin checking the criminal backgrounds of temporary workers.
Honore has no prior criminal record.

   Ruling by Arbitrator Splits Arthur Andersen in Two
</P>
<P>
   An international arbitrator ruled that the world's largest
consulting firm could separate from the the world's largest
accounting firm. The ruling frees Andersen Consulting, with 65,000
employees, from its parent company, which now consists entirely of
Arthur Andersen, a tax and auditing firm with 77,000 employees. In
exchange, Andersen Consulting will have to give up its name and pay
Arthur Andersen $1 billion. Analysts called the decision, coming at
the end of a three-year battle, a major victory for the
consultants.

   Bear Stearns, the sixth-biggest United States securities firm,
paid $30 million to settle a lawsuit over its role as an adviser on
an ill-fated takeover, said lawyers involved in the case. The case
sent tremors through Wall Street two years ago when a federal jury
in California found the firm was negligent in the way it advised
its client, Daisy Systems, on a 1989 purchase of Cadnetix, and
awarded $108 million in damages to shareholders. The judge later
reduced the award to $36 million.

   ABC to Correct Organic Food Story

   ABC News said a report it showed twice, challenging the assumed
benefits of organic food, was based in part on research that did

Friday night. In the report, the correspondent John Stossel said
that research commissioned by ABC showed that conventional produce
does not necessarily have more pesticide residue than organic
produce.

   Stocks Rise on Interest Rate Hopes
</P>
<P>
   Stocks rose for a third day on optimism the economy is slowing
enough that the Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates again
in 2000. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 75.63 points, or 2

   Computer Associates International, seeking to bolster its
sagging stock, reassigned senior managers and said it intended to
use spinoffs or other strategies to tap the value of fast-growing
units now overshadowed by the company's main businesses. Charles B.
Wang is turning over the job of chief executive to Sanjay Kumar,
who had been president and chief operating officer. Wang will

<P>
   Earnings Fall at British Airways
</P>
<P>
   British Airways reported a 65 percent plunge in quarterly
earnings, attributing the poor performance to the effects of the
strong British pound and the rising price of jet fuel. The airline
is trying to break out of a prolonged slump, partly through a
proposed deal to acquire KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. But there were
signs that those negotiations have not advanced very far.

GORE PICKS LIEBERMAN, WHO WILL BE FIRST JEWISH VP CANDIDATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE _ Opening a new chapter in American political history,
Vice President Al Gore chose Connecticut Senator Joseph Lieberman
as his running mate Monday, completing the Democratic ticket with
the first Jewish candidate for the office in a bold political move
Lieberman called a ``miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   An emotional Lieberman, notified informally of the vice
president's choice Monday morning, accepted Gore's invitation at
about 1 p.m. and then headed to Nashville with his wife, Hadassah,
and four other family members to join the Gore family for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``At certain times in my life, I dreamed of being a United
States senator, in itself a pretty bold and outrageous dream,''
Lieberman told reporters outside his Connecticut home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was lucky enough to realize that. I never dreamed of this.
It says to me and everyone else that every day we're lucky enough
to be alive by the grace of God is full of possibilities, and
miracles happen. I consider this a miracle for which I am
grateful.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman ``said a short prayer together'' when Gore
called to offer him the spot, the senator said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, for his part, refused to discuss his choice, insisting
that he would make his formal announcement Tuesday in Nashville.
``I'm going to pick someone who will be able to become president on
a moment's notice, if that should ever become necessary,'' the vice
president told reporters as he exited a local soda shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll pick someone who shares my values and can be a good
partner for me, and who will join me in fighting for people and not
the powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   A political centrist and a man commonly regarded as a voice of
moralism in the US Senate, Lieberman was praised Monday by
Democrats and Republicans alike. But while Democrats argued that
the deeply religious Lieberman would bring a tenor of moral
rectitude to the ticket, Republicans argued that Lieberman's
differences with Gore on issues such as Social Security and school
vouchers would spell trouble for the Democrats' campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut senator is ``a good man whom Governor Bush and
Secretary (Dick) Cheney respect . . . for his intelligence, his
integrity, and for many of the positions he has taken,'' Ari
Fleischer, spokesman for the Bush campaign said. Some of those
positions _ favoring private school vouchers in certain cases, for
example _ are closer to Bush's views than Gore's, Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's spokesman, Chris Lehane, dismissed the criticism, saying
Gore and Lieberman are in agreement on many key issues, such as
support for the ``V-chip'' to screen violent TV programs, funding
for enterprise zones, and strict environment protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore is at the top of this ticket. The ticket is going to
reflect his agenda,'' Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman is perhaps best known as the first Democratic senator
to publicly chastize President Clinton publicly for his conduct in
the Monica S. Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such behavior is not just inappropriate, it is immoral,''
Lieberman told his Senate colleagues in September 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feelings of disappointment and anger have not dissipated,
except now these feelings have gone beyond my personal dismay to a
larger, graver sense of loss for our country, a reckoning of the
damage that the president's conduct has done to the proud legacy of
his presidency, and ultimately an accounting of the impact of his
actions on our democracy and its moral foundations.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, vacationing on Martha's Vineyard, nevertheless saluted
Lieberman as ``a wonderful friend to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been great for America,'' said the president, who as a
student worked on one of Lieberman's early-career campaigns for the
Connecticut state Senate. ``I'm very happy about Joe Lieberman.''
</P>
<P>
   Both campaign aides and Democratic consultants said Lieberman's
presence on the ticket will help neutralize the kind of character
attacks the Republicans made during their convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will work very well,'' said former vice president and
presidential nominee Walter F. Mondale. ``He is able, respectable,
and represents the middle of the Democratic spectrum. Lieberman
also separates the issue of Clinton's behavior from the Gore
ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   David Axelrod, a Democratic consultant in Chicago who is closely
allied with Mayor Richard M. Daley, called Lieberman ''a moral and
ethical leader who is also someone who has supported the right
issues _ the patients bill of rights and prescription drugs (for
Medicare patients) _ that puts the ticket on the side of working
families.''
</P>
<P>
   But the most dramatic response to Gore's choice was to the vice
president's dramatic move to break a religion barrier, a move that
surprised and impressed many in the Democratic party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore deserves a lot of credit'' for making the choice,
Democratic Party general chairman Ed Rendell said in an interview.
Rendell had observed last Saturday that ``if Joe Lieberman were
Episcopalian, he would be a slam-dunk,'' a comment that suggested
Gore would not risk selecting a Jew as his running-mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I meant was that if he were an Episcopalian, there'd be
nothing to hold him back as a vice presidential candidate,''
explained Rendell, who is Jewish. He added that he called
Lieberman, and that Lieberman ``said it's fine. He understood what
I meant. He had no problem with it.''
</P>
<P>
   As an Orthodox Jew, Lieberman is not supposed to work on
Saturdays, the Jewish Sabbath. Lieberman has in the past debated
and voted on Saturday, citing an exception in Jewish law that
allows work when human life or national security is at stake, noted
Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Lehane said Lieberman's religion was not a major part of the
search committee discussions. Both campaign aides and Democratic
analysts noted that people who wouldn't vote for the Democratic
ticket because Lieberman is Jewish probably wouldn't have been
voting Democratic anyway.
</P>
<P>
   It's not yet clear whether Lieberman will completely avoid
campaigning on Saturdays or during the high holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we're going to be very, very respectful of his
religion,'' Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's selection ``is a milestone in America's political
maturing process,'' Foxman said. ``In today's political culture,
the fact that the senator wears his faith, his values and his
religiosity on his sleeve can be an asset rather than a
liability.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's religion ``has been a marginal factor'' in
Connecticut politics, said Howard L. Reiter, a political science
professor at the University of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   The ticket ``is a test for the country, and I think it's a test
we're going to pass with flying colors,'' said Mark Mellman, a
Democratic consultant who is an informal Gore advisor. ``But make
no mistake about it. It's going to be a test.''
</P>
<P>
   While Jewish voters do tend to vote Democratic, Lieberman could
help energize the Jewish vote in Philadelphia, New York, New
Jersey, California, Philadelphia, Illinois and Michigan, a Gore
campaign official said.
</P>
<P>
   In the South, where Gore is weak, the Lieberman candidacy could
make the delegate-rich state of Florida a competitive race, said
Earl Black, a southern politics analyst at Rice University.
Southern Florida is home to many retired Jewish voters from New
York and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore needs to divide the South, and if you're not going to
have any kind of race in Texas, Florida is the next state,'' Black
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's presence on the ticket could have the ancillary
effect of boosting the campaign of First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton in her quest for the New York Senate seat, said Lee
Miringoff, head of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion in
Poughkeepsie, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is attracting Jewish voters ``in the low 50's,''
percentage-wise, and she needs to take about two-thirds of the
Jewish vote if she is to beat Republican rival Rick Lazio,
Miringoff said.
</P>
<P>
   For John Kerry, who had made the short-short list of three final
candidates, the announcement was a disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of day I'm used to because I'm a Red Sox
fan,'' the Massachusetts senator joked, his fingers stroking the
back of his wife, Teresa Heinz, as he spoke to reporters outside
his home.
</P>
<P>
   But ``for me it has been a great honor to go through this
process and both Teresa and I feel extraordinarily positive about
it,'' Kerry added. ``I don't feel anything except enthusiasm for
the next months.''

 UNDATED: nuclear exchange. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While administration officials agreed that Clinton's visit
helped ease some tensions, neither country has signaled that it
intends to halt development of the arsenals the two countries
revealed to the world by exploding nuclear devices in quick
succession in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   India continues to see its nuclear arsenal as necessary for its
status as an emerging power and to deter not only Pakistan but also
neighboring China, a Pakistani ally. Pakistan, less populous and
poorer than India, sees its nuclear force as essential to
counterbalance its rival's larger conventional forces.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, analysts have warned that if American plans for a
missile defense prompt China to build up its nuclear arsenal, still
more momentum will be added to the arms race across the region.
</P>
<P>
   While the president's visit has not prompted New Delhi or
Islamabad to scale back their nuclear programs, many experts say
the trip and subsequent administration diplomacy have helped to
nurture other positive political developments.
</P>
<P>
   India has released some political prisoners related to
Pakistani-backed militant groups in Kashmir, and last month one of
the most important of those groups, the Hizbul Mujahedeen, declared
a unilateral three-month cease-fire. The group opened talks with
India on Friday. But diplomats and other experts still see the
chances of a lasting breakthrough as low, and violence has
continued in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Given the Kashmir dispute, diplomats and arms control experts
see nuclear weapons on the subcontinent as particularly dangerous.
India and Pakistan, unlike other nuclear powers _ for example, the
United States and Russia _ share a common border, have had no
sustained dialogue and lack even a framework to hold serious
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   After Pakistan moved into Kargil, Pakistan's rhetoric grew
increasingly harsh and India prepared to mobilize a significant
force that could have led to a dramatic escalation, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kargil proved that having nuclear weapons would not deter new
conflicts,'' Perkovich said. ``It also showed that unless such
conflicts themselves were prevented, the possibility of an
accidental or deliberate nuclear exchange would also increase given
both states' relatively poor systems of intelligence surveillance
and nuclear command and control.''
</P>
<P>
   While neither private experts nor the American government has
firm estimates of the size of the Indian and Pakistani nuclear
arsenals, Perkovich estimates that India has produced enough
plutonium for 60 weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he believed that India had far fewer actual bombs,
``in the neighborhood of 35 weapons.'' In the event of a nuclear
war, these would be delivered by aircraft. Pakistan has enough
highly enriched uranium for roughly the same number of bombs, he
added, and it could deliver them by a combination of bombers and
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen P. Cohen, a South Asian policy scholar at the Brookings
Institution in Washington, called the risk of nuclear conflict
``serious'' and ``increasing.'' But the president's trip, he said,
had succeeded in engaging Washington in the region, a development
that was particularly important to India, which has long desired to
be seen as an Asian power. ``The president should have gone much
earlier,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Oakley, a former ambassador to Pakistan, said that
Washington may have inadvertently helped fuel Pakistan's nuclear
ambitions and reduced American leverage over Islamabad by failing
to resume economic and military assistance to Pakistan that
Congress cut off in 1990 because of the Pakistani nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
   Experts and diplomats said Clinton had been determined to visit
India after Hillary Clinton, the first lady, and their daughter,
Chelsea, toured the country in 1995, and when he finally went, in
March, the trip was billed as a ``war prevention trip,'' according
to one participant in the intelligence assessment, which was begun
with the two-month Kargil conflict that ended the previous July.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the intelligence report concluded that the region
demanded high-level attention to defuse tensions and prevent the
outbreak of conflicts that could escalate, the politics of the trip
dovetailed perfectly with the intelligence assessment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During his visit, in an address to the Indian Parliament,
Clinton appealed to the ``great nation of India'' to give up its
nuclear arsenal, and he urged India to take the lead in starting a
dialogue with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Progress toward such a dialogue seemed to be building with a
meeting of the two countries' prime ministers on their border in
early 1999. But after the Kargil incursion, which came just months
later, India's leadership felt betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   Since Kargil, Pakistan's civilian government was overthrown in a
military coup last October. Clinton met briefly with the leader,
Gen. Musharraf, after his much longer visit to India, but made no
headway on a range of American concerns, including when Pakistan
would return to democratic government.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan continues to maintain that it will not scale back its
nuclear program unless India does so first.
</P>
<P>
   While India has said that it will not be the first to use
nuclear weapons in a conflict in the region, it has made clear that
it will respond if attacked. Indian officials brushed aside efforts
by Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott to persuade them to
join international talks aimed at ending the production of fissile
materials for nuclear weapons. And Prime Minister Vajpayee has
steadfastly refused to renounce the country's nuclear arsenal,
though he has pledged not to conduct further nuclear tests.

CHARLES SCHWAB PUSHES FOR LEARNING `DIFFERENCES,' NOT
DISABILITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By KRUTI TRIVEDI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles Schwab, the billionaire businessman who runs one of the
world's most successful brokerage firms, is dyslexic. But, he
insists, that does not mean he is disabled. ``I look at it as a
difference,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when school districts are moving to standardize the
curriculum and districts are placing a heavier emphasis on state
tests, Schwab is spending the equivalent of hundreds of millions of
dollars leading a campaign of Americans who refer to themselves as
having ``learning differences'' rather than learning disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   To some, Schwab is on a quixotic semantic quest, something like
making sure the bald are called ``follically challenged.'' But to
others, he is using his name and fortune to undermine a delicate
and vital financing structure it has taken years to erect.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab said his main purpose was to encourage schools to see all
children as distinct learners who need individualized attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're trying to do with all this definitional stuff is
to make sure you don't beat the kids down and make them think
they're fully defective,'' he said. ``My fundamental belief is that
you want to emphasize the kids' strengths.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwab's initiative makes the Learning Disabilities Association
of America, the most powerful advocacy group for the learning
disabled, nervous. It is concerned that children with learning
disabilities will not get the services they need if they are
redefined under the broader term learning differences. What's more,
the group is worried that the federal financing for which it has
fought for years will decline or even disappear if ``learning
differences'' comes into favor with legislators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger, and where the controversy comes from, is that
there are some parents who would not like to have their child
called disabled,'' said Ann Kornblet, executive director of the
Learning Disabilities Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that a true learning disability is a
handicapping condition. Without understanding that, you're not
prepared to help them prepare for a life of advocating for
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Schwab is not alone. An increasing number of parents seem to
be referring to their learning disabled children as learning
different and teachers are starting to use the term in the
classroom.
</P>
<P>
   The Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act of 1975 uses
the term ``learning disability'' to classify children with ``a
disorder in one or more of the basic psychological processes
involved in understanding or in using language, spoken or
written.''
</P>
<P>
   A learning disability may show up as an imperfect ability to
listen, think, speak, read, write, spell, or do mathematical
calculations, according to the federal definition. Education
officials say that 12 percent of all school-aged children are now
classified as learning disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the strongest voices in the learning-disabled community
_ which includes researchers, lawyers, and the advocacy group _ say
the term disabled may have a negative connotation to some but is
still the most accurate. They worry that Schwab's opposition to the
term could unravel an identity it has taken years to weave.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're stuck with the term partly because we need to because of
advocacy and partly because it's true,'' said Larry Silver,
president of the disabilities association. ``You empower your kids
by helping them understand themselves: `learning differences'
suggest that you're just like everyone else, except if they add
with their fingers, you add with your toes.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwab's pronouncements bear a special weight in the
learning-disabled community, because he is its largest benefactor.
</P>
<P>
   To date, he has endowed what amounts to $280 million in Schwab
stock to the groups that use the term learning difference.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab said he first discovered his dyslexia as an adult, when
listening to a doctor explain why his son was having problems
reading. As he sat in the doctor's office, Schwab says he realized
that many of his own problems with language were caused by the same
reason.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife, Helen Schwab, founded the Charles and Helen
Schwab Foundation, now called the Schwab Foundation for Learning,
in 1987 to address the needs of families.
</P>
<P>
   Along with his own foundation, he is the co-chairman of All
Kinds of Minds, an iconoclastic organization that looks at every
child _ disabled or not _ in terms of strengths and weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our model is one where we refuse to label anybody, so we have
no `learning disabilities,''' said Mel Levine, co-chairman of the
organization with Schwab.
</P>
<P>
   The group has already trained 5,000 teachers around the country
to speak the language of learning differences at several regional
training centers, including one program run by The Bank Street
College of Education in Manhattan. Plans are in the works to open a
chain of consultation centers where parents can take their children
to be evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Levine hopes that every school in the country will
follow his model.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are determined to start a national movement,'' he said,
speaking of the work his organization is doing. ``As of now, we're
swimming upstream in many respects because people love to label
kids, people love to medicate kids and people love to test kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwab added: ``You need a few people to step out and say there
is an issue, there's a stigma.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to say, `I've dealt with it and it's not going to be
the worst thing in the world.'''

ANALYSIS: LIEBERMAN'S REPUTATION FOR PROBITY SEEN AS MAJOR FACTOR
IN SELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (With GORE-LIEBERMAN) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After striving for more than a year to outrun
President Clinton's restless shadow, Vice President Al Gore on
Monday made his boldest bid yet for autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   By picking Sen. Joseph Lieberman, one of the earliest Democrats
to rebuke Clinton during the impeachment proceedings, Gore's
objective, his advisers and other leading Democrats say, is to seek
to replace his political partner of eight years with a fresh _ and
untainted _ face who is regarded as one of the most upstanding
politicians in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats close to Gore also said he was seeking a No. 2 who
could inject a note of excitement into the race and illuminate the
Democratic ticket, as polls show that Gov. George W. Bush is on the
ascendancy after his triumphant convention in Philadelphia last
week.
</P>
<P>
   At that convention, the Bush campaign left no doubt it will make
the moral lapses of Clinton a basic subtext of its strategy,
emphasizing the need to restore dignity and honor to the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very clear after Philadelphia that these guys are going
to run a campaign of innuendo and guilt by association,'' said Al
From, the executive director of the Democratic Leadership Council,
a moderate group that Lieberman had chaired for five years. ``It's
going to be harder for Republicans to sustain that campaign. A
Gore-Lieberman ticket is not going to be associated with bad
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the very factors that make Lieberman an enticing choice also
make him a vulnerable one.
</P>
<P>
   In picking the first Jewish running mate _ and an Orthodox one
at that _ Gore hopes to underscore his willingness to break the
political rules and display a dash of daring that has largely been
absent from his campaign. But while the choice could energize
Jewish voters (though they are overwhelmingly Democratic anyway) it
could alienate others who might not be comfortable with a Jew in
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Gore hopes to protect himself from scandals of Clinton by
tethering himself to a politician who is above reproach, and who
has spoken out not only against the president but for campaign
finance reform. The downside is that Lieberman's public
denunciations of Clinton in 1998 could give the Republicans cover
to even more forcefully raise questions about the Clinton
administration's conduct, including Gore's own fund-raising
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   In turning to a politician with a decidedly moderate voting
record who prides himself as not being particularly partisan, Gore
also may have an easier time challenging Bush for the loyalties of
independent voters that he desperately needs to win. But that could
also unsettle some faithful Democrats who cringe at Lieberman's
breaks with the Democratic Party _ and Gore _ on issues ranging
from school vouchers to capital gains taxes. Some of these voters
could even end up defecting to Ralph Nader, the Green Party
nominee, Democratic strategists fear.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Gore campaign had tried to tar Bush by invoking Dick
Cheney's conservative voting record, the Bush campaign on Monday
sought to use Lieberman to undermine Gore's positions. The campaign
said Gore picked a running mate whose ideology is closer to Bush
than to the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been trying to figure out what the Gore people were
thinking,'' said Michael Nelson, a political scientist and
authority on the vice presidency at Rhodes College in Memphis.
``He's Jewish but it's not as if the Democrats don't already have
them energized. The only thing it brings is criticism of the
president _ and I don't see that as an advantage. Like it or not,
the vice president is yoked to the president whom he served.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans acknowledged it was difficult to directly condemn
Lieberman because of his reputation for moral rectitude. William
Bennett, the conservative morals maven who is close to Lieberman,
said he could not find fault with a politician who joined him in
repudiating the film industry in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's arguably the best Democrat in the Senate,'' Bennett said.
But asked whether Lieberman's ramrod reputation would inoculate
Gore against being linked with Clinton, he made a point echoed by
some Democrats, ``I don't know that Gore becomes a saint because of
Lieberman's virtues.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans made it clear that they are not about to abandon
their drive to fasten Clinton to Gore with the same zeal that
Democrats tied Bob Dole to Newt Gingrich four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Bush advisers said they had no expectation that they will drop
this refrain that Cheney declared to cheers in Philadelphia last
week: ``As the man from Hope goes home to New York, Mr. Gore tries
to separate himself from his leader's shadow. But somehow, we will
never see one without thinking of the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Gillespie, an adviser to the Bush campaign, practically
validated Gore's choice by calling Lieberman ``a decent man and an
honorable person.'' But, he added, ``There are just a number of
significant issues that Gore has just bitterly attacked Governor
Bush on and now he turns around and picks a running mate who agrees
with Bush on those issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps an even bigger danger for Gore is that several political
consultants said they did not have to think hard to come up with an
attack commercial for the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It would open with a clip of Lieberman shaking his finger like
an Old Testament prophet, denouncing Clinton for ``disgraceful''
and ``immoral'' behavior. The next frame would be a clip of Gore,
celebrating Clinton as ``one of our greatest presidents.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercial could end with side-by-side photographs of a
scowling Clinton and Gore and the tagline, ``Even his running mate
disagrees with Al Gore over what is appropriate conduct for a
president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   However Lieberman is received, this much is clear: It was not a
play-it-safe choice as was Bush's pick of Cheney. That reflects the
political reality that as his convention approaches next week in
Los Angeles, Gore advisers said they felt it was necessary to do
something daring _ yet not foolhardy _ to gain ground.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats on Monday said they have come around quickly to
Gore's thinking. In assessing the other possibilities on Gore's
short list of running mates, they said that Sen. John Edwards of
North Carolina was charismatic and youthful, but would be attacked
for serving only a year and a half in the Senate. And Sen. John
Kerry of Massachusetts, they said, had the experience and a
compelling war record, but could be dismissed as a Northeast
liberal as Gore is trying to broaden his appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But in keeping with the mold cast by Clinton in selecting Gore
eight years ago, the vice president demonstrated that he was not
driven by crass electoral considerations, like picking a candidate
from a battleground state. Some Democrats said they expect, though,
to hear grousing from voters who complain that in picking a Jewish
running mate, Gore is pandering to one of the most important
segments of the Democratic electoral base and one of the party's
deepest sources of contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans, however, rejected the notion that
Lieberman's religion could damage him. They said that people who
would oppose the ticket because of Lieberman's religion would
probably support the third party candidacy of Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing Lieberman, Gore also showed he was comfortable with
a No. 2 who is not known as especially scintillating on the
campaign trail. (It could be, of course, that after being Clinton's
understudy, Gore did not want someone who would outshine him.)
</P>
<P>
   And the vice president's choice seemed to reflect his genuine
concern about having a No. 2 with the experience and temperament to
help him govern. In addition, many people close to Gore have long
said that if personal chemistry were the more compelling factor,
Lieberman would shoot to the top of the list.
</P>
<P>
   For all the calculations of how Lieberman would help or hurt,
the senator, in an interview several weeks ago, dismissed what he _
or anyone _ could bring to the ticket. ``I presume any factor can
make enough of a difference,'' he said, ``although not a large
difference to be significant.''
</P>
<P>
   The relevance of a running mate choice, he said, was that it
``may tell the American people something more about the two major
candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the choice may tell the public something more not
just about Gore, but about his relationship with his political
partner for the past eight years.

HYBRID COIN _ A DOLLAR AND A QUARTER _ ADDS UP TO BIG BUCKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Pa., Ark.)   By JED STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Frank Wallis flips one coin, it is a quarter if it lands on
heads and a dollar if it comes up tails.
</P>
<P>
   That gold-colored coin has the back of a new Sacagawea dollar
but the front of a quarter, and it could bring Wallis thousands of
dollars at a Philadelphia auction that begins Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Such coins, with an incorrect striking on one face, are called
mules, just like the hybrid animals, and they are rare. Coins with
two denominations are so rare that none are known to have
previously been struck by the Mint since it began its work 208
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Mint officials have been closemouthed about the mistake,
although acknowledging that one did happen. Coin experts have
speculated that the only way such a misstrike could have occurred
was that a Mint worker replaced a Sacagawea obverse die with an
obverse quarter die. The result is a Sacagawea coin whose back
correctly shows a soaring eagle but whose front, rather than
depicting the Indian woman who served as a guide for the Lewis and
Clark expedition, instead shows the quarter's familiar profile of
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first year of minting Sacagawea dollars, and more
than 800 million of them have been struck so far. Thousands of
misstruck coins may have been produced before the error was
detected. The flawed coins were probably then destroyed, but a few
got into general circulation.
</P>
<P>
   Wallis, of Mountain Home, Ark., discovered the first such mule
in a roll of Sacagawea dollars he bought at a local bank in late
May. The discovery was first reported, on June 27, by Numismatic
News, whose managing editor, David C. Kranz, says that ``four of
them have now been found, and a fifth is rumored.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the known four, one was sold on eBay for $41,395. Two others,
one of them Wallis', are being auctioned this week in Philadelphia,
at the annual convention of the American Numismatic Association.
</P>
<P>
   While those two coins are expected to bring thousands of
dollars, subsequent finds will diminish the rarity and thus the
value of the entire batch. But a one-dollar investment will still
have brought a substantial return.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Vice President Al Gore picked Sen. Joseph I.
Lieberman of Connecticut to be his running mate Monday, putting a
Jew on a national ticket of a major party for the first time and
choosing the first prominent Democrat to openly chastise President
Clinton for his affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is to formally announce his decision at a rally here at
noon on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman was one of five candidates to be thoroughly vetted by
a corps of lawyers over the last two months and emerged as Gore's
choice early Monday morning, after the vice president huddled for
hours with top aides and family members at a hotel suite here.
</P>
<P>
   Gore aides said Lieberman brought a sense of moral rectitude to
the ticket as well as a seriousness of purpose, qualities that Gore
was intent on seeking after Gov. George W. Bush, his Republican
rival, chose Dick Cheney, the former secretary of defense, as his
running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Christopher, the former secretary of state, who led
Gore's selection process, said in an interview Monday that Bush's
choice had influenced Gore. ``Cheney meant that the vice
president's choice would be measured by a standard of seriousness
reflected by his record,'' Christopher said.
</P>
<P>
   But the comments of the Gore camp, laced with words like
integrity and rectitude, also seemed to reflect their desire to use
Lieberman to move their candidate away from the scandals of the
Clinton administration, which provided one of the themes of last
week's Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at both men, Al Gore and Joe Lieberman, they're
both people who throughout their lives made the right choices,''
said &UR;  &LR; Chris Lehane, Gore's spokesman. ``Both led very responsible
lives and are people who, when faced with tough choices, have time
and time again made the right choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has also been a vigorous advocate of campaign finance
reform, and he recently supported legislation that would ban
unregulated donations to political parties. His record on the issue
could clearly benefit Gore, whose aggressive fund-raising efforts
in 1996 are expected to be the subject of Republican attacks in the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   But in choosing Lieberman, Gore has also picked a running mate
whose record on a number of issues, from school vouchers to capital
gains taxes, are more conservative than the vice president's.
</P>
<P>
   Although reporters were informed of Gore's chose around dawn
Monday morning, Gore did not formally offer the spot to Lieberman
until the afternoon, catching the senator on his cell phone as he
drove into his driveway in New Haven, Conn., after giving a speech
to the Connecticut AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the call,'' Lieberman told reporters waiting at his
house. ``It was directly from Al Gore.'' He said the two had said a
short prayer together.
</P>
<P>
   Gore chose Lieberman over several other senators, including John
Edwards of North Carolina, whose only governmental experience was
two years in the Senate, and John Kerry of Massachusetts, whose
liberal voting record would surely have become an inviting target
for the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Also vetted were Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana and Gov. Jeanne
Shaheen of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, a 58-year-old Orthodox Jew, is known on the national
stage chiefly as the first Democrat to condemn Clinton during the
Lewinsky scandal, when he took to the Senate floor and branded
Clinton's behavior ``immoral.'' Gore, who did not criticize the
president throughout the impeachment process, has had a difficult
time in his campaign distancing himself from Clinton's personal
behavior, in part because he has also sought to associate himself
with the president's positive job performance and the booming
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of Lieberman, Gore advisers said, recognizes that the
Republicans will try to make the president's character a campaign
issue, and they hope the move will shield Gore from such attacks
and undermine Bush's claim that he will restore honor and integrity
to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Gore advisers said the decision, and its timing, a week before
the opening of the Democratic convention in Los Angeles, also was
grounded in Gore's recognition that he needed to do something to
shake up the race. The latest polls show Gore trailing Bush by as
much as 17 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign portrayed the selection of Lieberman as a bold
choice because of its historic nature in naming the first Jew to a
national ticket. At the same time, Gore aides said they believed
that the decision would demonstrate something the campaign has been
trying to convey for months _ that Gore is a ``principled fighter''
who would stand up for those who have been discriminated against.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Gore began interviewing potential running mates at the end of
July and had completed them by July 25. He interviewed Lieberman in
Washington at the vice president's residence, where four of the
five candidates sneaked past television cameras. He interviewed the
fifth candidate in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman, who have known each other since serving in
the Senate together, spoke for about an hour in the interview.
</P>
<P>
   One of the overriding factors for Gore was that he pick someone
who could become president on a moment's notice. This became more
imperative, advisers said, after Bush picked Cheney. Although Gore
advisers delighted in what they perceived as immediate weaknesses
in Cheney's voting record, they also saw that Bush had picked
someone whose ability to step into the Oval Office would not be
questioned.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Christopher said that Gore chose Lieberman for several
reasons. He said the vice president valued the senator's
independence, and the two were personally compatible. And,
Christopher said, Gore regarded Lieberman as ``a symbol of
rectitude.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore could visualize his being a very wise counselor in the
White House,'' Christopher said. ``People in the Senate have a very
high regard for the values he brings to decisions,'' he said,
adding: ``He conveys a very serious purpose.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The final selection process spanned several hours on Sunday.
Gore met at his hotel suite here at 3:30 p.m. Sunday with
Christopher, William Daley, his campaign chairman, and Frank
Hunger, his brother-in-law. They met until 6 p.m., then recessed.
</P>
<P>
   At 9, after dinner, they reconvened, this time with Jim
Hamilton, the senior vetter, and two aides, Tom Nides and Ron
Klain.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's wife, Tipper, and one of their daughters, Sarah, arrived
about 11 p.m., their commercial flight from Washington delayed by
bad weather. The circle then expanded to include other top
advisers, including Donna Brazile, the campaign manager, Tad
Devine, Carter Eskew and Bob Shrum.
</P>
<P>
   Gore made his decision after midnight. Some in the room asked
him if he wanted to sleep on his decision. He said no.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said he awoke to news reports that he had been chosen.
Monica Dixon, a Gore adviser, told Lieberman's staff that the
reports were based on statements by Democratic officials, but
Lehane, the Gore spokesman, said that Dixon had not told them
whether the accounts were true.
</P>
<P>
   When the cameras caught up with him mid-morning, Lieberman said
he was still awaiting the call. But he was confident enough to be
overjoyed, saying, ``Miracles happen.''

 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Sept. 3, 1998, Joseph Lieberman stood up in the U.S. Senate
to speak about Bill Clinton. They had been friends and Democratic
allies for 30 years, but the cornered president had finally
admitted having an affair with Monica Lewinsky. Anger, resentment,
a sense of betrayal: the bitter emotions had racked the nation, and
were about to find a powerful voice in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such behavior is not just inappropriate _ it is immoral,''
Lieberman said, abandoning for a principle a man who had campaigned
for him in his first political race for the Connecticut state
Senate in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it is harmful, for it sends a message of what is
acceptable behavior to the larger American family,'' he added. ``I
fear the president has undercut the efforts of millions of American
parents trying to instill in our children the values of honesty.''
</P>
<P>
   With those hard words, Lieberman, the first Orthodox Jew to
serve in the Senate, became the first Senate Democrat to denounce
the president's behavior. While he ultimately voted to acquit
Clinton in his impeachment trial, the episode strongly reinforced
his reputation as a maverick Democrat, often at odds with party
leaders, and as a moral compass in the wastelands of politics.
</P>
<P>
   It was apparently with those beguiling traits of pragmatic
independence and personal integrity in mind that Al Gore tapped the
58-year-old Lieberman as his vice-presidential running mate, a
choice widely seen as his boldest stroke yet to distance himself
from President Clinton and the scandal-tainted Clinton
administration, and one to spark his campaign before the start of
the Democratic convention in Los Angeles next week.
</P>
<P>
   While Lieberman was expected to help Gore shed himself of
Clinton's baggage, his selection also carried a risk, for he would
be the first Jew named to a national ticket. The weeks to come may
show whether Lieberman's faith will raise questions in the same way
that John F. Kennedy's Catholicism became a focus in the 1960
presidential election: whether religion might affect his
performance as vice president, for example, or the policies of a
Gore administration _ or a Lieberman administration _ toward the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, who describes himself as an observant Jew, strictly
observes the Sabbath, from sundown on Fridays to sundown on
Saturdays. While his religion ostensibly prohibits working, riding
in vehicles and other activities during the Sabbath, Talmudic
scholars say that exceptions are allowed for Jews to act to
preserve human life or on behalf of the needs of the community.
</P>
<P>
   In public life for more than three decades, Lieberman has always
shunned campaigning and purely political activities on the Sabbath,
but has considered it his duty to attend legislative sessions, to
vote and to sit in on important public meetings. In 1988, for
example, he refused to attend the Democratic convention that
nominated him for the Senate, but has often walked five miles to
the Senate from his home in Georgetown. He has cast 75 votes on
Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has been a staunch Senate supporter of Israel, but has
also backed arms sales to Saudi Arabia. And he has often found
himself in the company of Senate Republicans. In 1991, for example,
he was one of 10 Democrats to support American involvement in the
Persian Gulf war, and he was one of a handful of Democrats who
favored the deployment of American troops in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to do what I think is right on every issue, and not
feel obliged to vote a particular way because it's the party line
or because people expect me to,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   In his 12 years in the Senate, Lieberman has acquired a
reputation for steady habits, family values and faithfulness to his
beliefs _ a moderate who carefully deliberates options, sometimes
agonizing over them publicly, and often seems to be striking a
balance between conservative and liberal instincts.
</P>
<P>
   On the liberal side, he has voted for abortion rights, gun
control, tax increases, welfare reforms, consumer protections and
civil rights legislation. On environmental issues, he helped draft
clean air laws, wrote the Pollution Prosecution Act of 1990,
exposed lax security measures in nuclear power plants and supported
minimum-wage increases and laws to protect whistle-blowers.
</P>
<P>
   On the conservative side, he has been far more enthusiastic than
most of his Democratic colleagues concerning military spending. As
a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, he has had an eye
out for Connecticut's many military industries. Among other things,
he has supported the development of an anti-missile defense system
for the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Not one to toe a party line, Lieberman broke ranks with
Democrats in 1997 during the Senate hearings on campaign finance,
which investigated fund-raising abuses by the Clinton-Gore campaign
in 1996. Other Democrats lobbed softball questions at
administration witnesses, but Lieberman asked tough questions and
tried to position himself as objective and above the fray.
</P>
<P>
   He also has been conservative on so-called family values and
related issues. He supported tuition vouchers, for example, that
would allow parents to send their children to private schools at
taxpayer expense. And while some of his colleagues have dubbed him
the ``conscience of the Senate,'' he has also been criticized as
something of a moralizer.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Lieberman and William Bennett, the former secretary of
education, began handing out ``Silver Sewer Awards'' to draw
attention to the producers of sexually explicit and violent films,
music, television programs and video games. Critics were quick to
note, in a recent financial disclosure form, that the Senator had
stock in Fox and CBS, two recipients of his awards.
</P>
<P>
   He also pushed for electronic devices that would permit the
blocking of television programs that parents find offensive, has
monitored a system of voluntary ratings to guide children's
television viewing and has denounced rap music with lyrics that
celebrate violence and drug use.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman is not an electrifying orator. Associates say his
politics and personality are too moderate for him to play for an
emotional edge. His speeches tend to be heavy with facts and
figures. But having run for offices since he sought his ninth-grade
class presidency, he is poised in public and at times passionate
about the issues.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Lieberman was born in Stamford, Conn., on Feb. 24, 1942,
the son of Henry Lieberman, a liquor store owner and real estate
agent, and Marcia Manger Lieberman. He attended public schools in
Stamford and Yale University in New Haven, where he graduated with
a bachelor of arts degree in 1964. Three years later, he received
his law degree at Yale.
</P>
<P>
   For two summers during his college years, he worked in
Washington as an intern, once for Sen. Abraham Ribicoff of
Connecticut and once for the Democratic National Committee. After
practicing law for several years, Lieberman, at the age of 28, ran
successfully for the state Senate in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   One of his campaign volunteers was Bill Clinton, then a
24-year-old Yale law student. (Lieberman returned the favor in
1992, becoming the first senator outside the South to endorse the
Arkansas governor for president.) After a decade in the state
Senate, the last six as majority leader, Lieberman gave up his seat
to run for Congress, but lost.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, however, he made a comeback, winning election as
Connecticut's attorney general by a wide margin. He gained wide
popularity as an advocate for consumers and environmental issues,
and was overwhelmingly re-elected in 1986. Halfway through his
second term, he ran an uphill but successful campaign to unseat
Sen. Lowell Weicker Jr., a popular three-term Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Early in Lieberman's Senate career, a pattern became apparent.
Lieberman voted with Democrats on civil rights and environmental
issues, but joined Republicans on several high-profile issues, like
military spending and foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, he first voiced support for the confirmation of
Clarence Thomas as an associate justice of the Supreme Court, but
eventually voted against him. His varying stances, however, did not
appear to harm his standing with senators on either side of the
aisle, many of whom say they respect his independence, or with the
voters. He was re-elected in 1994 with 67 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has written five books, including ``The Power
Broker,'' a 1966 biography of the late Democratic party chairman,
John Bailey; ``The Scorpion and the Tarantula,'' a 1970 account of
early failures in controlling nuclear proliferation, and ``In
Praise of Public Life,'' a study of practical politics, written
with Michael D'Orso and published this year.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman and his wife, the former Haddasah Freilich, have each
been married twice. His first marriage, to Elizabeth Hass, whom he
met in 1963 when they were interns in Ribicoff's office, ended in
divorce in 1981. They had two children, Matthew, now 32, and
Rebecca, 31. He and Haddasah married in 1983, and she brought a son
from her previous marriage, Ethan, 24. The couple also have a
daughter of their own, Hana, 12, and two grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   The Liebermans, who have homes in New Haven and Georgetown, are
not lovers of the social scene in Washington, preferring quiet
dinners at home. He jogs to keep in shape, and reads voluminously,
including the Bible daily. He attends services in the capital at
Kesher Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The rabbi there, Barry Freundel, is a friend, and said of the
senator: ``He's not afraid to put life's most important things in
front of politics.''

PICKET LINES SWELL AND PHONE DELAYS SPREAD IN VERIZON STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (With VERIZON-WIRELESS) 
 By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A strike by more than 86,000 workers of the nation's biggest
telecommunications employer intensified Monday as problems with
local consumer telephone service _ some of it the result of
vandalism _ began to spread and picket lines swelled in a 13-state
region stretching from Maine to Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Chances of a quick resolution to the strike, which began on
Sunday, appeared to grow more distant as negotiators hit a snag on
several issues, according to people close to the negotiations
taking place at L'enfant Plaza Hotel in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Communications Workers of America and the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers are striking
against Verizon Communications, the company that was formed by the
recent merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE Communications.
</P>
<P>
   On the walkout's second day, about 14,500 union members were
picketing outside 550 telephone company buildings in the region.
That was more than than five times the number of workers walking
picket lines on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   While business customers appeared to be relatively unaffected by
the strike on Monday, residential service in scattered parts of New
York and other Eastern cities was knocked out by incidents of
vandalism, which police officials said might have been
strike-related. In New York alone, the police department reported
more than 70 such incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency services continued to function normally, along with
other parts of Verizon's network that are automated. But delays in
repairs and installations seemed inevitable even as Verizon
(pronounced va-RISE-en) dispatched some 30,000 managers to fill in
for striking employees. Workers remain on the job at the company's
nonunion Verizon Wireless unit, the nation's largest cellular
telephone company.
</P>
<P>
   Strikers seemed determined to stay on the picket lines as
negotiators in Washington continued discussing a range of issues
that include forced overtime and the loss of jobs from mergers. One
issue, extending union representation to workers in the company's
fast-growing wireless and Internet access businesses, could
potentially alter organized labor's role in high-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be here 'til we get what we want,'' Ella
Simmons, a striking telephone operator, said as she picketed
outside a call center in Washington Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The CWA, which represents 72,000 of the striking employees, said
that the biggest gap between labor and management involved the
union's effort to limit the number of jobs that can be shifted from
one region to another as a result of Bell Atlantic's takeover of
GTE.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family doesn't want to get uprooted any more than yours
does, but this company doesn't care about that possibility,'' said
Richard Leath, 50, who works as a line splicer for Verizon in
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon has amended an earlier proposal that had called for up
to 6 percent of its work force either to move or lose jobs as a
result of the Bell Atlantic-GTE merger. The latest offer from the
company would set the figure at 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the union is seeking a figure closer to the .5 percent it
was guaranteed after Bell Atlantic acquired Nynex in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Among other issues, the two sides have yet to reach an agreement
over how to make it easier for the union to organize workers at
Verizon Wireless, which has 32,000 employees and is seen as the
fast-growing part of the company where the best jobs may be found
in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The union filed a complaint last month with the National Labor
Relations Board over an incident the CWA contends took place at a
Verizon Wireless call center in Woburn, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   According to the complaint, management representatives, in what
would be a violation of the law, told employees that they could not
distribute union literature or discuss unionization anywhere on the
premises of the center, which has about 300 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The National Labor Relations Board is reviewing the complaint, a
process that could take months or even years. ``I'd be very
surprised to find out we acted illegally,'' said Eric Rabe, a
spokesman for Verizon.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to organize Verizon's wireless division are being
closely watched elsewhere, because so far the nation's wireless
industry has had few union workers.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators continued talks that were expected to last late into
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The relative lack of network disruptions reflects the high
degree of automation in modern telecommunications networks. More
than 98 percent of the calls that the 25 million business and
residential customers in the strike region place on Verizon's
network take place with no human assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Any disruptions Monday were ``nothing big, nothing more than
normal,'' said Rob Wilson, a spokesman for the Massachusetts
Department of Telecommunications and Energy, the state's utilities
regulator, which fields complaints about telephone service from
consumers.

STRAWBERRY UNDERGOES OPERATION FOR CANCER 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the second time in two years, Darryl Strawberry,
the former Yankee slugger, underwent surgery Monday to remove a
cancerous tumor in his abdomen. The surgery marked the beginning of
another and much tougher round in his fight against colon cancer,
cancer experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry was in stable condition at Columbia Presbyterian
Medical Center Monday night after a team of four surgeons found and
removed an ``isolated tumor mass'' near the left kidney, Myrna
Manners, a spokeswoman for the hospital, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The physicians caring for Strawberry are optimistic for an
uneventful recovery'' from surgery, Manners said.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry's cancer was first discovered in early October 1998
as the Yankees were steamrolling toward the World Series. Surgeons
operated on him Oct. 3, removing a 16-inch section of his colon and
36 lymph nodes. One of those lymph nodes tested positive for
cancerous cells, suggesting the cancer had begun to spread through
the lymphatic system. Strawberry underwent intensive chemotherapy
for six months.
</P>
<P>
   Though Strawberry did play last season, he missed 113 days.
Major League Baseball suspended him after he was arrested in Tampa,
Fla., in April 1999 on charges of possessing cocaine and soliciting
a prostitute. He returned to the Yankees on Sept. 1 and, over the
last 24 games of the season, hit .327 with three home runs and six
runs batted in, helping the team to its third World Series in four
years.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two weeks ago, while Strawberry was serving a yearlong
suspension for failing a drug test, a CAT scan revealed what
appeared to be a cancerous growth in a lymph node near the site of
his original tumor. Last week, tests at the Palms of Pasadena
Hospital in Tampa, Fla., confirmed the player's worst fears: the
cancer had returned.
</P>
<P>
   In those tests, Jonathan D. LaPook, Strawberry's
gastroenterologist, determined the cancer had spread into tissue
next to the player's left kidney but appeared not to have recurred
inside the colon itself.
</P>
<P>
   The surgeons _ Mitchell C. Benson, George J. Todd, Richard L.
Whelan and Peter B. Schiff _ said after the operation that they
believed they had removed all of the cancerous tissue, Manners
said. It remained unclear what further treatment Strawberry would
be given, but it is likely to include chemotherapy, oncologists
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You trust the people who are taking care of you,'' Yankees
Manager Joe Torre said. ``He has to be convinced he's in good
hands. It's nice to have faith, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the successful surgery, it will be an uphill battle for
the former slugger. Harmon Eyre, the chief medical officer of the
American Cancer Society, said studies have shown that people who
have a recurrence of colon cancer within two years have a 5 percent
to 15 percent chance of survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a new baby,'' Torre said, ``and that's something that
scares you the most.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry's odds may be slightly higher because he is
relatively young at 38 years old and extremely strong, Eyre said.
That means he can withstand stronger doses of chemotherapy and more
extensive surgery than an older patient could.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of people who have a recurrence of colon
cancer die from it,'' Eyre said. ``It's not a good situation, but
it's not totally hopeless, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Strawberry has made millions as a ballplayer in the last
17 years, he has told reporters recently that he is in deep
financial trouble. Strawberry, an eight-time All-Star, has five
children from two marriages. He was put on baseball's ineligible
list because he tested positive for cocaine on Feb. 28. It was the
third time he had been suspended for cocaine use in his career. In
March, he checked into a rehabilitation clinic in Fort Lauderdale,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, however, he left the clinic abruptly, telling
counselors he needed to earn money. In late July, he asked Major
League Baseball to reinstate him early. He also pursued a minor
league contract with the St. Paul Saints in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry has a career batting average of .259. He has hit 335
home runs and driven in 1,000 runs in 1,583 major league games with
the Mets, the Los Angeles Dodgers, the San Francisco Giants and the
Yankees. He was the National League Rookie of the Year with the
Mets in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the promise he showed that year, Strawberry's career
has been held back by numerous personal problems: twin addictions
to alcohol and cocaine, injuries, charges of tax evasion, and
failure to pay child support.

EDITORIAL: THE LIEBERMAN CANDIDACY 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Aug. 8:
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore's decision to choose Sen. Joseph
Lieberman of Connecticut as his running mate is certainly the most
dramatic move he has made in his presidential campaign, and may
turn out to be one of the smartest. It is not just that Lieberman
has been an effective senator. Of far greater significance is that
he was the first Democratic senator to denounce Bill Clinton for
``disgraceful'' and ``immoral'' conduct in the Lewinsky scandal and
for his failure to speak truthfully to the American people about
his behavior. In a very real sense, therefore, Lieberman's
selection announces a redoubled effort on Gore's part to separate
himself from Clinton's personal shortcomings. It also provides him
with insulation on the character issue at a time when the
Republicans, as Richard Cheney made clear in his speech at the
Philadelphia convention, plan to make an issue of the erosion of
presidential dignity during Clinton's eight years in office.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's decision was bold in one other respect. Lieberman will be
the first Jew nominated for president or vice president by a major
party. Recent polls have suggested that religion will not be an
important factor when Americans make up their minds in this
election. Nevertheless, Gore is in effect inviting the voters to
tear down any remaining barriers against Jewish candidates, much as
they did for John F. Kennedy's Catholicism a generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   As an Orthodox Jew who does not customarily work on the Jewish
Sabbath, Lieberman may be called upon to explain how he will handle
a job that demands full attention 24 hours a day, seven days a
week. Lieberman has already provided an answer. He states that,
while he does not carry out political or campaign activities on the
sabbath, Jewish law obligates him to perform official government
duties demanded of his job. He makes the analogy that Jewish law
also obligates a doctor to help a sick patient in such
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Other aspects of the choice were less surprising. Eight years
ago, when Clinton picked Gore, a middle-of-the-road Southerner, he
broke from the traditional practice of selecting running mates from
another part of the country to provide a geographical and in some
cases ideological balance. Now Gore has reached out to a fellow
centrist with a comparable record of breaking ranks with many of
their fellow Democrats on important issues like defense and free
trade. Lieberman was also one of only 10 Democratic senators who
supported President Bush on the gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   On this issue, too, Lieberman seems a shrewd political choice,
in that he will help inoculate Gore against charges that the
Democrats have been soft on matters of national security.
Similarly, Lieberman was and is a major advocate of campaign
finance reform who was forthright in criticizing Democratic
fund-raising abuses in 1996. This is also an issue where Gore, who
has promised reforms, needs to bolster his credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democratic liberals may be uneasy over Lieberman's
readiness to ally himself with conservatives on social issues. He
has criticized the television and music industries for too much
violence and sex, and he has also been more willing than party
orthodoxy to embrace school vouchers. But he has a solid record on
gay rights, gun control and the environment, and he is pro-choice
on the abortion issue. The Republicans may be tempted to replay the
senator's biting attack on how the president degraded the White
House. But if they go that route, they may find themselves
reinforcing the virtue of his selection, and perhaps be seen as
re-fighting the very battles in Washington that Governor Bush
declared in his acceptance speech that he wants to move beyond.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In two terms in the U.S. Senate, Democratic vice-presidential
hopeful Joseph Lieberman has at times voted more like a potential
running mate for Gov. George W. Bush than Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, senator from Connecticut, sponsored legislation in
support of private school vouchers, has spoken in favor of
privatizing Social Security, and was a prominent critic of
President Clinton during the impeachment scandal.
</P>
<P>
   But while he differs from Gore on a variety of issues, political
observers said Monday that Lieberman's record in the Senate could
prove a political enhancement for the Democratic presidential
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lieberman's voting record places him politically to the right
of Gore, which shows that the election is not about rousting the
core voters, but playing to the center,'' said Bob Stein, Rice
University political scientist and pollster.
</P>
<P>
   Like Gore, Lieberman supports abortion rights, and he voted
against a ban on late-term abortions, known by opponents as
partial-birth abortion.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Lieberman also has called for requiring
parental consent of minors seeking abortions in federally funded
clinics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Lieberman, a critic of the entertainment industry's
penchant for sex and violence, co-sponsored V-chip legislation to
help parents monitor what kids watch on television.
</P>
<P>
   Varied on issues of interest to gays, Lieberman sponsored
anti-discrimination legislation protecting homosexuals in
employment matters.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1994, Lieberman spoke disparagingly of the ``homosexual
lifestyle'' in backing a bill to deny funding for schools that
present materials supportive of homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Since joining the Senate, Lieberman has supported experimental
voucher programs that would let parents use federal funds to send
children to the schools of their choice _ a plan favored by Bush
but opposed by Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Schechter, chair of the Harris County Democratic Party,
downplayed the significance of conflicting positions between the
running mates, saying it's up to Gore to set the tone for the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Bradley supported vouchers and he certainly seemed to
have a strong following among Democrats,'' Schechter said. ``I am
not sure there are big enough differences there that anyone is
going to be too concerned about.''
</P>
<P>
   On defense issues, Lieberman sided with Republicans in backing
early deployment of the national missile defense system, and he
supported the war in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Like Gore, he now supports the death penalty, although he
opposed it earlier in his career.
</P>
<P>
   He has supported the Clinton administration's anti-crime
legislation, notably mandatory sentencing guidelines for crimes
involving guns.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Lieberman has been directly critical of
Clinton and Gore on campaign finance and recent controversies over
the duo's fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Stein, noting that past fund-raising scandals present a
lingering political problem for Gore, said Lieberman's moral
rectitude on that and other issues could actually prove useful for
the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore is not credible to moderates and conservatives, and to
independent and swing voters, it looks like he's pandered to a wide
range of traditional Democratic constituencies,'' Stein said.
``What he says with Lieberman is that this is a guy out front for
vouchers who's been critical of the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Lieberman has criticized human rights infractions in
China, he shares Gore's interest in liberalized trade and
normalizing trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's record reflects support for expanding hate crimes
laws, and for environmental initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   He backed mandatory child safety locks on guns and a five-day
waiting period for handgun buyers and a ban on semi-automatic
assault weapons. &QL;

ABC TO CORRECT REPORT THAT CHALLENGED BENEFITS OF ORGANIC FOODS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JIM RUTENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ABC News said Monday that a report challenging the
assumed benefits of organic food was partly based on research that
did not exist. It said it would make a correction on Friday night's
``20/20'' program.
</P>
<P>
   In the report, the correspondent John Stossel said research
commissioned by ABC News showed that conventional produce did not
necessarily have more pesticide residue than did organic produce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our tests, surprisingly, found no pesticide residue on the
conventional samples or the organic,'' he said in the report first
broadcast on Feb. 4 and again on July 7.
</P>
<P>
   But the two researchers who were commissioned to do the testing
_ Dr. Michael Doyle, a scientist with the University of Georgia,
and Dr. Lester Crawford, director of the Center for Food and
Nutrition Policy at Georgetown University _ said they had never
tested produce for pesticide residue for ABC.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released Monday night, ABC confirmed that
pesticide tests were never performed on produce. But it steered
blame away from Stossel. ``In making that statement, Mr. Stossel
was relying on inaccurate information that had been provided to
him,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   Executives said David Fitzpatrick, producer of the segment, was
responsible for the error, and they were trying to determine how it
appeared. But, they said, they believed it was an honest mistake
and did not think Fitzpatrick would be disciplined. Stossel will
make the correction.
</P>
<P>
   Top ABC News executives began looking into potential problems
with the report two weeks ago, after The New York Times addressed
them in an article.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not the first time the issue had been raised with ABC
News. Problems with the report were first brought to light by the
members of the Environmental Working Group, which supports the
consumption of organic food. They had learned that Stossel's
assertion about the pesticide tests was in error after speaking
with the researchers.
</P>
<P>
   They apprised Stossel of their findings in a letter dated Feb.
8. They were answered by Fitzpatrick, who, in a letter, asserted
that ABC did, indeed, test produce for pesticide residue. After the
report was rerun, Stossel re-emphasized the pesticide assertion in
an on-the-air conversation with Cynthia McFadden, a ``20/20''
anchor.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at ABC, a unit of Walt Disney, said they were trying
to determine why the group's assertion about the supposed pesticide
tests was not properly addressed when it was first raised.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Working Group also contended that Stossel's
report had inappropriately implied that ABC's tests had detected
dangerous strains of E. coli bacteria in the organic food when, in
fact, the tests did not establish the presence of the dangerous
type of E. coli.
</P>
<P>
   Executives said they were still looking into that accusation.

 &HT;    Lieberman accepts Gore's VP offer
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nashville, Tenn. _ Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut joins
Vice President Al Gore here today to make his debut as the
Democratic presidential candidate's running mate and the first Jew
on a major-party ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is scheduled to introduce Lieberman at a downtown rally at
1 p.m., 24 hours after he offered him the post.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, the first prominent Democrat to publicly criticize
President Clinton over the Monica Lewinsky affair, took the call
from Gore on his car phone Monday as he was returning from a
speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to ask you if you would honor me by being my running
mate,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be honored,'' Lieberman replied. ``I'd be humbled.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men had a moment ``of shared prayer,'' the 58-year-old
senator said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, his wife, Hadassah, two of their four children and
his mother flew to Nashville on Monday evening to have a private
dinner with Gore and his wife, Tipper.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman and Gore will be in Atlanta on Thursday with Gov. Roy
Barnes and a contingent of Southern Democratic governors to promote
the successes of welfare reform. Georgia Democratic Party Chairman
David Worley said they will attend a rally at noon at Centennial
Olympic Park downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman is perhaps best known outside his home state for the
hard line he took on the Lewinsky matter and on the fund-raising
practices of the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's choice of Lieberman, who nevertheless voted to acquit
Clinton on impeachment charges, may be intended to blunt efforts to
tar Gore with the Clinton character issue, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows Al Gore's sense that he is very vulnerable to the
linkage to Bill Clinton and the whole character aspect,'' said
Republican pollster Whit Ayres of Atlanta. ``This is an effort to
separate him from President Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton on Monday had nothing but praise for Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a bold thinker, he's always full of new ideas, he's
supported the changes that we've made over the last eight years,''
Clinton said, speaking to reporters while vacationing at Martha's
Vineyard, Mass. ``I think he's just an extraordinary guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman also won praise from some of the core constituencies
of the Democratic Party, including the environmental activist
Sierra Club and the Human Rights Campaign, a gay and lesbian rights
group. AFL-CIO President John Sweeney also applauded Lieberman,
even though the senator, like Gore, supports free trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
   But Loretta Kane, acting vice president for the National
Organization for Women, said her group was disappointed Gore didn't
pick a woman to run with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not our dream candidate, but he's not a nightmare
either,'' Kane said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, who surprised the political establishment when he
upset Republican Sen. Lowell Weicker in 1988, cuts a different
profile from Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Easygoing and accessible, Lieberman is generally not regarded as
a fierce partisan, and he has worked with Senate Republicans on a
number of high-profile issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe Lieberman is not a party-line Democrat,'' said Sen. Max
Cleland of Georgia, a Democrat who serves with Lieberman on two
Senate committees.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman was a co-sponsor of tax-free education savings
accounts for elementary and secondary school, legislation promoted
by the late Republican Sen. Paul Coverdell of Georgia and opposed
by Gore.
</P>
<P>
   He has been a harsh critic of Hollywood and the entertainment
industry's use of sex and violence in movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore and I have pretty much walked the same path, and where
we've had disagreements they've been good-faith disagreements,
never disagreements that touch our values,'' Lieberman said Monday,
speaking outside his home in New Haven, before he received the call
from Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaignsought to minimize the policy differences,
saying the two men share the same core philosophy of improving the
lives of ordinary Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ticket is going to reflect (Gore's) agenda,'' said Gore
spokesman Chris Lehane. Gore will not change his opposition to
education savings accounts favored by Lieberman, Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gore-Lieberman ticket will represent the new guard,''
Lehane said. ``A central issue of this campaign is: Do we want to
turn the clock back, which is Bush-Cheney, or do we want to move
forward?''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman learned of his selection when news leaked out early
Monday morning from Gore's headquarters in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   He was clearly surprised, telling reporters outside his home
that ``miracles happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I never dreamed of this,'' Lieberman said. ``And you know what
it says to me _ and everyone else _ that every day that we are
lucky enough to be alive by the grace of God is full of
possibilities, and miracles happen. And I consider this a miracle
for which I am grateful.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore settled on Lieberman on Sunday night after meeting with
campaign chairman William Daley, campaign manager Donna Brazile,
wife Tipper and former secretary of state Warren Christopher, who
chaired Gore's search committee, Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the running at that point included Sens. Evan Bayh of
Indiana, John Edwards of North Carolina, John Kerry of
Massachusetts, House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri
and New Hampshire Gov. Jeanne Shaheen.
</P>
<P>
   Gore phoned the other potential candidates Monday afternoon and
called two ``wild card'' candidates whom Lehane declined to
identify.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman is not required to give up his Senate seat to campaign
for vice president, but he would resign if he and Gore win. His
resignation would allow Connecticut Gov. John Rowland, a
Republican, to name a successor, possibly complicating the
Democratic Party's hopes of gaining a majority in the Senate.

 &HT;    Lieberman's religious faith deep and long-standing
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - If he is elected, this vice president
will pray for 45 minutes every morning before breakfast. He will
drape a prayer shawl over his shoulders and attach a small wooden
box filled with Hebrew prayers, written on parchment, on his
forehead and arm.
</P>
<P>
   If he is elected he will attach passages from Deuteronomy to
every door of his vice presidential mansion. He will ask that the
food at State dinners be cooked in a kosher kitchen. He will not
drive or write or work on the Sabbath unless it is absolutely
necessary, and he will study the writings of long-dead rabbis with
names like Maimonides and Rashi and Rashbam for wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps most conspicuously, if Joseph Lieberman is elected
vice president of the United States, the two-term senator from
Connecticut will put to rest a question floated in synagogues and
Jewish community centers across the country for years: Is America
ready for a Jew in the White House?
</P>
<P>
   ``Was I surprised when I woke up this morning and I heard he'd
been nominated? You bet I was,'' said Rabbi Moshe Scheiner of the
Palm Beach Orthodox Synagogue, which Lieberman attends when he is
in the area. ``I didn't think this country was ready to have a Jew
one heartbeat away from being president, but obviously (Gore) reads
the climate better than I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman is not just a Jew, he is an Orthodox Jew _ one of only
three in Congress out of 23 Jewish representatives and 11 senators.
(U.S. Reps. Robert Wexler and Peter Deutsch are the other two).
</P>
<P>
   He walks the 3 miles from his house to Capitol Hill if he has to
vote on the Sabbath, when driving is forbidden. He observes the
Jewish dietary laws. He studies the ancient commentary of the
Torah. He is married to the daughter of a rabbi. His own daughter
was recently bat-mitzvahed in New Haven, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been serious about his religious beliefs as long as I've
known him,'' says Dr. Michael Gelfand, president of the Palm Beach
Orthodox Synagogue and a friend of Lieberman's since their freshman
year at Yale. They were two of only four students in the class of
'64 to observe the kosher dietary laws. ``He was (Sabbath
observant) in college. This is something that has been ingrained in
him since childhood.''
</P>
<P>
   How ingrained? Lieberman once told the congregation at Palm
Beach Orthodox Synagogue that during a 12-mile road race he ran at
Yale he sang ``U'faratztah'' under his breath the entire distance
to keep himself motivated. The peppy song is the unofficial tune of
the Chabad Lubavitch sect of orthodoxy and means literally ``And
you shall spread forth.''
</P>
<P>
   As a Modern Orthodox Jew Lieberman believes that every word in
the Torah was dictated by God to Moses, says Scheiner. But instead
of building a wall around themselves as some orthodox Jewish
communities do, modern orthodoxy asks believers to fuse ancient
Judaism with the modern world.
</P>
<P>
   The concept may sound a little foreign to non-Jews. But Gore is
hoping that taken together with Lieberman's reputation for honesty
and integrity it will come off as noble and admirable, said Andrew
Grossman, a Democratic pol suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, anti-Semitic campaigns may even be welcomed by the Gore
team, Grossman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any attack on Lieberman (as a Jew) is the worst-case scenario
for Bush,'' Grossman said. ``All it takes is for one person to open
their mouths _ and you know they are going to _ and a whole lot of
moderates are going to flee the Republican Party. ``
</P>
<P>
   From where Ed Lefkowitz sits in his home on Singer Island, the
fact that this conversation is taking place at all is a bit of a
miracle. An 80-year-old Holocaust survivor, born in Poland,
Lefkowitz said even 20 years ago if someone had told him there
would be religious Jew on the presidential ticket, he would have
laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world has come forward a big, big amount,'' Lefkowitz
said. ``This is a big chance for us. Hopefully he'll make the Jews
proud.''

OAKLAND JOINS THE BAY AREA BOOM

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ The construction cranes and cement trucks are
taking over the downtown here, like the armored force of a
conquering army.
</P>
<P>
   Smack in the middle of the commercial district, a brick's throw
from the falling-down houses that have symbolized Oakland for a
generation, is the growing behemoth of an office tower _ the first
to be built in the city in more than 10 years _ that promises to
alter the landscape here for decades to come.
</P>
<P>
   All around that project, dot-com businesses are plowing down old
walk-ups for shiny new headquarters or swooping down on boarded-up,
sad-sack buildings and restoring them into the proud, handsome
office complexes they once were. In short, downtown Oakland can
boast that it is within striking distance of 1.6 million square
feet of offices and stores, built over the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   That Oakland has become so popular, already facing the same
space shortage, skyrocketing rents and gentrification battles that
plague the rest of the San Francisco Bay area, is an extraordinary
testament to the new economy.
</P>
<P>
   The last hot property within commutable distance of Silicon
Valley has long been the plain Jane cousin to San Francisco's prom
queen, never noticed except for its missteps (remember Ebonics?)
and flaws. From its slums, which rival the toughest in the nation,
to its reputation for high crime (a reputation not always deserved,
but hard to shake) to its poorly performing schools and
deteriorated housing, save for a few choice neighborhoods that
prefer to call themselves something other than Oakland, the city
has had a bad rap for so long that Mayor Jerry Brown likes to say
it has stagnated with ``diminished expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, largely because it is _ or was _ the last affordable
bastion in the Bay area, and because it has courted new residents
and businesses, Oakland is feeling the ups and downs of a boom.
Those celebrating include Ask Jeeves, the $1 billion Internet
search company, which is one of dozens of dot-coms that have staked
a claim here, with a commitment to moving at least 700 employees
into its new space from the nearby city of Emeryville.
</P>
<P>
   The Port of Oakland is getting in on the action as well, with a
$727-million modernization. Forbes magazine is impressed enough to
rank Oakland as No. 12 on its list of the top cities in the nation
to do business, ahead of San Francisco (No. 42) and Silicon
Valley's unofficial capital, San Jose (No. 29).
</P>
<P>
   But the pressure is building along with the boom. Oakland,
always considered a Bay area haven for the poor and dispossessed
has also become the last refuge for the middle class. Nonprofit
organizations, renters and house buyers alike have been leaving the
overpriced, overcrowded city of San Francisco in droves. They are
coming to this city of 400,000 people as their best hope for an
affordable place in the Bay area. Soon, a real estate agent said
recently, ``all that will be left is the wishbone.''
</P>
<P>
   All this new money gives Oakland an odd feel. In a scene from
the new Oakland, dot-comers with Palm Pilots are sitting in
Starbucks while homeless panhandlers who have lived here forever
stand outside waiting to ask them for spare change. The hot real
estate market is also creating a panic among members of the working
class, who have made up the backbone of the city, as rents rise and
renters are evicted, legally and not.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Nadel, an Oakland City Council member whose district
includes much of the prime development zones said that real estate
speculation had led to a housing crisis for the poor as landlords
evicted longtime tenants and, sometimes illegally, raised rents.
``As new owners acquire properties at higher prices, they are
raising prices higher than our somewhat weak rent control laws
allow, and evicting people illegally,'' Nadel said.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland still has a lot of its old problems, too. Its crime
rate, which has been dropping steadily, recently took an upturn.
Poverty and homelessness, drug dealing and AIDS, all plague the
city.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there are the new worries: skyrocketing rents, the
condemnation of old buildings that have given refuge to the very
poor and a growing sense of uneasiness on the part of many longtime
residents, many of them African-Americans, that their city is now
for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're getting enough attention focused on the
housing needs going on here,'' said Linnie Cobb, a 62-year-old
homeowner who has lived in Oakland most of her life. Cobb, who is
co-chairwoman of the local chapter of Acorn, the national community
advocacy organization, says she hears complaints all the time from
people who wonder what is happening to their city.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bad when you have a whole community up in arms except for
the yuppie types or the middle class or the rich,'' Cobb said.
``We're seeing a migration of yuppie types moving in and blacks and
minorities are being pushed out.''
</P>
<P>
   The newcomers are the city's biggest cheerleaders. John Dolby,
marketing director for the Shorenstein Co., which is building a
20-story office tower downtown, said the falling vacancy rates for
prime office space _ down to 1 percent (almost as low as San
Francisco's) from 9 percent last year _ reflected a changing
perception among wealthy companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a perception of Oakland that it was crime-ridden and
dilapidated, which is not the case,'' Dolby said. ``And then Jerry
Brown came in and the perception is changing for the better, blocks
getting cleaned up, not only downtown but surrounding
neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   Sam Nassif, owner of the Waterfront Hotel on Jack London Square,
was vice president of the city's Convention and Visitors Authority
when it sputtered to a close in 1998. Now, as chairman of a revived
bureau, he leads a 24-member board that can boast that Oakland's
2,000 hotel rooms are near-capacity in peak times. Another 630
rooms are slated to open in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   A growing problem for the city is sparked by its war on decades
of blighted housing. Since the city strengthened its antiblight
laws two years ago and urged citizens to file complaints, it has
issued 14,000 summonses for ugly nuisances, including trash cans
left at the curb too long and building code violations. ``This is a
very self-conscious effort at social engineering to get us on the
train of economic revival,'' said Claudia Leed, a deputy city
attorney.
</P>
<P>
   For some residents, the enforcement goes too far, punishing poor
people who can not afford to repair their houses to code. Slapped
with fines that start at more than $700 and quickly climb, old
homeowners may be pushed out of their only option at housing. This,
a growing number of ministers and community organizations say, is a
part of the consequence of Oakland's newfound popularity with the
rich and middle class.

NEWS ANALYSIS: UNIONS LEAVE COMPANIES SPEECHLESS

or 888-346-9867.) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Want to watch public relations executives from the nation's
biggest communications companies get uncomfortable? Ask them about
their unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the current circumstances I think our executives would
rather stay out of this, so we're going to decline to get involved
in this story,'' Burke Stinson, an AT&AMP;T spokesman, said Monday, the
second full day of a strike by 87,000 union workers at Verizon
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Or ask Mark Bonavia, a spokesman for the Sprint Corp. ``We
decline to discuss the issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Or Joe Chandler, a spokesman for the BellSouth Corp., which has
52,000 union employees out of 99,000 total. ``The people who are
closest to this, it's going to be difficult for them to be out
front on this right now, so you're stuck with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Even at Worldcom Inc., which has fewer than 500 union workers
among its 75,000 employees, the subject is officially out of
bounds. ``We just have a policy that we don't talk about these
issues,'' said Peter Lucht, a Worldcom spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   For companies that spend millions of dollars lobbying
regulators, buying advertising and trying to influence members of
the media _ not to mention having communications as their core
business _ why the sudden laryngitis? Because the unspoken secret
is that the established communications carriers that still have
unions basically wish that they did not. And the younger companies
that do not have them will do just about anything to keep them
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``All else being equal, would it make our life easier if there
were no union? Of course,'' said an executive at a large
communications carrier, on condition of anonymity. ``But we do, so
we just have to deal with it, and it's very delicate.''
</P>
<P>
   It is delicate because of fear, in particular fear of the
Communications Workers of America. But the bald fact is that a
preponderance of the communications companies that have had the
best financial performance over the last decade (Worldcom, for
instance) have not had the significant union presence of many of
the industry's laggards (AT&AMP;T and the former Bell company Nynex,
which is now part of Verizon).
</P>
<P>
   To acknowledge this is not to say that unionization is prima
facie bad for a communications company. It may just be that the
communications carriers that have had the strongest and most
powerful unions have happened to be in the weakest strategic
position, or have had subpar management or have been plain unlucky.
</P>
<P>
   And it may be that, down the road, companies with loyal
unionized work forces will fare better than even nonunion companies
in hotly contested growth businesses like wireless communications
and high-speed Internet access _ markets where the ability to
provide a reliable network and professional customer service may
matter more to customers than providing the lowest-cost product.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a reason why Verizon, the local phone behemoth
formed by Bell Atlantic's acquisition of the GTE Corp., has been
willing to tolerate a strike by tens of thousands of its workers as
it negotiates a new contract with the CWA. There is a reason why
the company has been fighting to keep its fast-growing wireless and
Internet operations union free.
</P>
<P>
   That reason is that the company, rightly or wrongly, appears to
believe that unions put it at a some disadvantage. And at least
some investors and financial analysts agree.
</P>
<P>
   This is Business 101. Few companies of any kind welcome unions.
But what makes the issue more important for the big, old
communications companies is that they are battling well-financed
competitors in various niches of their business _ especially
wireless and data communications _ that have little or no union
presence at all. So as the growth in the communications business
continues to shift to those very niches, those big old companies,
each in turn, could find themselves fighting this same battle.
</P>
<P>
   On condition of anonymity, one Wall Street analyst said Monday
that if Verizon's wireless operation were completely unionized, it
could cost the unit $300 million in additional annual expense. That
money probably means a lot more to Verizon's workers than it does
to the company; some analysts are expecting that same wireless unit
to generate $5.5 billion or more of cash flow this year. So in the
overall financial scheme, unionization may not be that big a deal.
</P>
<P>
   But there are other factors that matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're unionized,'' said John M. Bensche, a wireless
communications analyst for Lehman Brothers, ``you have less
flexibility in terms of hiring and firing people. And when you're
growing this fast and want to shift resources around in a company,
that can matter. For example, you might see a company move an
entire collections department over to customer activation at
Christmas time because it's really busy. And you might have to ask
whether they could do that if they were unionized.''
</P>
<P>
   Verizon and the other Bell companies in particular have become
very familiar with union work rules (and, some might say, the ways
around them). The issue they face is that the unions can use their
leverage over the companies' core business _ providing local
telephone service _ to try pry open new business units that had not
been unionized.
</P>
<P>
   But that leverage does not exist at, say, VoiceStream
Communications, an upstart wireless company that has agreed to be
acquired by Deutsche Telekom and that has has virtually no union
presence. Even at Sprint, only 10,500 of the company's 78,000
workers are unionized, almost all of them in Sprint's local phone
business _ not long-distance, not wireless and Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   MCI, the long-distance carrier that spent years battling the
unions, was acquired in 1998 by Worldcom. And Bernard J. Ebbers,
Worldcom's chief executive, has been loath to deal with unions. The
fewer than 500 of the combined MCI-Worldcom's 75,000 employees who
are unionized are affiliated with the Teamsters, not the CWA.
(Perhaps not coincidentally, the unions were big opponents of
Worldcom's proposed acquisition of Sprint, a deal recently shelved
in the face of opposition by antitrust regulators.)
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Bell companies, because of their legacy as part
of AT&AMP;T, have always had a significant union presence. AT&AMP;T itself
still has 36,000 union workers out of a total of 145,000 employees.
And the former Bell company Nynex, which covered New York and New
England before merging with Bell Atlantic a few years ago, was
always considered a union bastion with its New York-to-Maine
territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strength of organized labor is a nontrivial reason why
Nynex had lower productivity than its peers,'' said Eric
Strumingher, a communications analyst at Paine Webber.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go back and look at the CLECs,'' Strumingher added, using
telecommunications argot to refer to new local communications
companies like MFS, which was acquired by Worldcom, and Teleport,
which was acquired by AT&AMP;T. ``They had non-union labor, and they
were competing against companies that were unionized, and that was
a clear advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, of course, there is only so much money to go around,
and everyone _ workers, management, investors _ wants as much as
possible. Labor negotiations may not quite be a zero-sum game, but
they can appear quite close.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, I think everything will be fine,'' said Adrian G.
Davies, a communications analyst for Federated Investors, the
mutual fund company based in Pittsburgh. ``But unionization means
less money for shareholders, and of course we're not happy about
that.''

GORE HOPES LIEBERMAN TO HELP DISTANCE HIM FROM CLINTON SCANDALS 
 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Presidential hopeful Al Gore sought to inoculate himself from
lingering effects of the Monica Lewinsky scandal by choosing as a
running mate Sen. Joseph Lieberman, who once ripped President
Clinton over the Lewinsky affair, political experts said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, D-Conn., a longtime friend and political ally of
Clinton's, was among the first and most vocal of Democrats
castigating the president for his sexual relationship with the
youthful White House intern. Lieberman called the relationship
``disgraceful'' and ``immoral.''
</P>
<P>
   Those words were surprising coming from a Democrat who was known
to be a Clinton confidant, but in character with Lieberman's
carefully cultivated reputation for rectitude.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks made Lieberman the symbol of those hating the sin
while loving the sinner, when it came to Clinton. And, some experts
said, they made him the perfect choice for Gore's effort to
distance himself from the president's scandals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the first one to step up to disapprove of Bill Clinton,
who was an old friend of his,'' said Stephen Hess, senior fellow at
the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. ``If that
doesn't give you a moral vaccination, nothing will.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as California political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe said,
``Joe Lieberman is air freshener for those who were going to have
to hold their noses to vote for Gore because of the Clinton
association.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts reckoned that the selection of Lieberman could free Gore
from continuing his own litany of disapproving statements about
Clinton's behavior while also helping make the case that Gore was
stepping out of Clinton's shadow and becoming his own man.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Gore has any overriding requirement heading to Los Angeles,
it is to establish himself as his own person,'' said Michael Franc,
an analyst at the Heritage Foundation. ``Surely the selection of
Lieberman, who was very critical of Clinton, goes a long way toward
doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   For Republicans tempted to use Lieberman's words blasting
Clinton against Gore, to do so carries the risk of being seen as
too willing to wallow in the mud of Clinton scandals people are
tired of hearing about, analysts warned.
</P>
<P>
   But others were dubious that Lieberman would prove a Teflon
coating shielding Gore from the residue of Clinton's ethical woes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it neutralizes the scandal issue for Gore,''
said Stuart Rothenberg, editor of a political insider's report.
``There are people who just won't vote for Gore because of the
ethical problems of the Clinton administration, and this doesn't
change that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rothenberg noted that Gore has had his own brushes with campaign
finance scandal, independent of the Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   It was Lieberman's sharp critique of Clinton's behavior during
the Lewinsky case that was the first major break in Democratic
ranks during the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Clinton admitted the affair with Lewinsky, and before
independent counsel Kenneth Starr filed his report describing
potential impeachable offenses against Clinton, Lieberman publicly
rebuked the president, saying the affair had ``compromised his
moral authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said in September 1998, that his initial anger at
Clinton's behavior had deepened to ``a larger, graver sense of loss
for our country, a reckoning of the damage that the president's
conduct has done to the proud legacy of his presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said Clinton's actions were ``disgraceful'' and,
``deserving of public rebuke and accountability,'' while adding,
``such behavior is not only inappropriate, it is immoral and
harmful.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore had no comment Monday on the Lieberman rebuke of Clinton, a
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, traveling in Massachusetts, said of Lieberman, ``He's
been a friend of mine for 30 years. I've worked with him for 15
years or more through the Democratic Leadership Council. He's a
bold thinker, he's always full of new ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Some conservative groups were willing to raise the specter of
Lewinsky on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Traditional Values Coalition, a conservative religious
group, issued a statement by its head, the Rev. Louis Sheldon,
saying Gore was trying to ``send a message to the American people
that he disapproved of Clinton's sexual antics,'' in picking
Lieberman. ``This `moral move' is a little late. In fact, it is
nearly eight years too late,'' Sheldon said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's willingness to criticize Clinton must be seen in the
context of a long friendship between the two that has continued
post-impeachment, Washington political experts said.
</P>
<P>
   And Lieberman can note that while he was critical of the
president, he did vote against impeachment. He also worked with
Republicans to assure a quick Senate trial at which Clinton was
acquitted. &QL;

IMF BOARD REJECTS A G7 PLAN TO RAISE LENDING RATES 
</HEADLINE>
  By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Poor countries are fighting a proposal by the
leading industrial nations to increase the cost of borrowing from
the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, dealing a blow
to the campaign by Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence H. Summers to
change the lending agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The differences emerged on Monday when Horst Kohler, the IMF's
new managing director, chided Group of 7 finance ministers for
announcing their desire to charge more for loans instead of working
within the fund itself to build consensus on the issue. Several big
nations that vote on loan decisions at the IMF and the World Bank
oppose the changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The direction the G7 have set up, I think, is right and should
be considered carefully,'' Kohler said about a plan that had been
endorsed by the wealthy nations in advance of their meeting of top
leaders in Japan last month. ``But it is now a problem because a
big group of countries within the fund feels itself lectured by the
presentation of these ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohler's comments came after the fund's board rejected the
proposal from the G7 in an unpublicized, informal tally late last
month, a board member said today. Only about half the board members
sided with the G7 countries, with 70 percent support required to
change lending rates.
</P>
<P>
   The board's decision was a setback for Summers, who persuaded
the G7 to endorse an increase in lending rates as an important
element of his plan to overhaul the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury secretary, responding in part to heavy criticism in
Congress, has tried to change some of the fund's practices to
address concerns that it has made mistakes while expanding its role
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   There appears to be broad agreement, especially among wealthy
nations, that the fund should streamline its activities. But
developing nations, which make up a substantial voting bloc on the
fund's board and double as leading borrowers, do not want to pay
more for their loans or to agree to apply for help less often.
</P>
<P>
   Some board members from poor countries also disagreed with the
reasons the G7 gave for wanting to raise rates. The industrial
nations said that higher rates could make more money available for
new lending and the forgiveness of debts of the poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a case of them asking the poor to help the poor,'' an
IMF board member said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the National Press Club is his first major public
event here since becoming managing director three months ago,
Kohler said he personally supported the idea of raising loan rates,
but disagreed with the G7's decision to push for the changes
outside the fund. He said the job of winning support had now become
tougher.
</P>
<P>
   Kohler became managing director after a protracted struggle that
pitted the United States and several other nations against Germany.
The Clinton administration effectively vetoed Germany's first
choice of a candidate to head the IMF before settling on Kohler,
who is a former German government official.
</P>
<P>
   Kohler used his address to preview other elements of a plan he
is working on to change the IMF. He repeated his intention to focus
the fund primarily on macro-economic management and to reduce
overlap with the World Bank's mandate, which includes fighting
poverty and overhauling the way poor countries manage their
economies. His ideas are broadly similar to those of Summers.
</P>
<P>
   Some G7 countries had earlier expressed a hope that the IMF and
the World Bank would endorse pricing changes during their annual
meeting in Prague, Czech Republic, in late September. But several
fund officials said that is unlikely now. An official at the World
Bank said its board was also discussing lending rates but that
there was no consensus to raise rates at this time.

STATES AND CITIES FLOUT LAW ON UNDERGROUND FUEL TANKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Conn., N.J., Calif., Texas, Ohio, Va.)  By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ While private industry spends millions to meet
a 1998 federal deadline to upgrade leaking underground fuel tanks _
the nation's leading cause of ground water pollution _ state and
local government agencies continue to operate thousands of
antiquated tanks in danger of leaking chemicals into water
supplies, records show.
</P>
<P>
   Most private companies, from deep-pocketed oil conglomerates to
mom-and-pop gas retailers, upgraded their tanks before the December
1998 deadline to avoid stiff fines and negative publicity. But many
governments, from New York state to the town hall in Cheshire,
Conn., have taken advantage of lax enforcement standards to flout
the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very tough making people do something like this,
especially when the political will isn't there,'' said Hal White, a
technician with the Office of Underground Storage Tanks at the
Environmental Protection Agency. ``What they really need is a
disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Most outdated underground tanks are probably leaking fuel,
either into the soil, drinking-water wells or aquifers, said Tim
Fields Jr., a Washington administrator in the EPA's solid waste and
emergency response unit. Leaking fuel tanks have already tainted
hundreds of wells in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut,
including more than 400 in New Jersey alone, according to a 1998
study by the agency. But leaking tanks are a nationwide problem. A
1998 study by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in
California found traces of a gasoline additive, MTBE, in more than
10,000 sites statewide. Environmental groups complain that many
other states, like Texas, have failed to adequately track leaks and
punish tank owners.
</P>
<P>
   The full impact on ground water supplies from these old steel
tanks, which become prone to leaks after about 10 years, will take
years to gauge, environmental experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is certainly a long-term issue,'' said Lois Epstein, an
environmental engineer with the Environmental Defense Fund in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly half the nation's population draws its drinking water,
billions of gallons of it per day, from below-ground sources like
public and private wells or aquifers. In 1984, recognizing the
potential threat that the old single-wall steel underground fuel
tanks posed to the water supply, Congress ordered the EPA to
establish a compliance program to remove or replace the tanks to
protect against corrosion, spills and leaks.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the agency gave owners of the nation's 3 million or so
underground storage tanks _ which hold hazardous liquids, including
gasoline and industrial solvents _ 10 years either to remove or
upgrade them.
</P>
<P>
   The federal regulations covered underground tanks capable of
holding at least 1,100 gallons; home heating oil tanks, which are
generally smaller, were exempt from federal law, though some
states, including New York, regulate them.
</P>
<P>
   About 85 percent of the 750,000 storage tanks still in the
ground nationwide were in compliance as of March, according to the
EPA. Fields called the agency's tank-upgrade program ``a tremendous
success story'' that has significantly reduced the amount of fuel
trickling into the nation's soil and water.
</P>
<P>
   About 110,000 other tanks are being operated illegally,
according to state records. ``A large portion of those would be
leaking,'' Fields said.
</P>
<P>
   In most states, only a slight percentage of underground tanks
are still operating illegally, according to the EPA. But in other
states, compliance rates are either far lower or unknown. In Ohio,
only 4,556 of the 29,177 active storage tanks were upgraded fully,
according to March data provided by the state to the EPA. Texas,
home to 62,600 storage tanks, more than New York and New Jersey
combined, failed to report any data for the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Most industrial and private tank owners, particularly those in
the highly competitive retail gasoline business, upgraded their
tanks before the deadline because they knew they would be the first
to be fined by the EPA, said John Huber, vice president of the
Petroleum Marketers Association of America, a trade group based in
Arlington, Va.
</P>
<P>
   But state and federal enforcement officials took a more lenient
approach with government-owned tanks, he said. ``If you're a state
EPA inspector, are you going to go around to the state police, or
are you going to check private citizens?'' Huber said. ``How smart
would you look to be the one to shut down an ambulance's tanks?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   State environmental officials said many government-owned tanks
listed as being in violation of the deadline might actually be in
compliance, but that there was no way to know until they were
inspected.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, several state agencies are operating a total of 350
tanks illegally, EPA officials said. A spokeswoman for the state,
Jennifer Post, disputed that number and said that only 74
state-owned tanks were out of compliance. New York City officials
are negotiating the penalty amount the city must pay for operating
614 underground fuel tanks past the deadline, said Nina
Habib-Spencer, an EPA spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, a state-managed database lists 440 tanks operated
by public agencies and governmental bodies that are being used
illegally.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, the EPA estimated that 100 to 300 water wells
are tainted by gasoline additives. More than a quarter of the 2,027
underground fuel tanks listed as out of compliance by the State
Department of Environmental Protection are owned by a town or city
or the state itself, records show.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut, like many other states, has about a dozen
tank-related spills and leaks a year. In June, for instance, an
upgraded fiberglass tank under an ExxonMobil station in Madison,
Conn., leaked 6,000 gallons of gasoline over five days,
contaminating local ground water.
</P>
<P>
   In early July, officials discovered 26,000 gallons of diesel
fuel had leaked from a tank under a truck stop in Southington,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, it's not documented as to how much leaked,''
said Peter Zack, supervisor of Connecticut's underground storage
tank leak-detection program. ``A lot of times it will show up in a
river or stream.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond contributing to soil and ground water contamination, the
failures of city, county and state governments to upgrade
underground storage tanks, has cost taxpayers hundreds of thousands
of dollars, if not millions, in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   On July 9, 1999, for example, the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority agreed to pay a $32,000 fine for allowing tanks under a
South Bronx bus depot to leak 9,000 to 19,000 gallons of fuel,
Habib-Spencer said.
</P>
<P>
   Since March, the EPA has sought to collect a $37,221 fine from
the State Department of Transportation for operating storage tanks
that do not meet federal regulations.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, at least 19 cities and towns, including
Hartford, New Haven, Waterbury and Danbury, have been fined or
cited for fuel tank violations, including some that have
contaminated rivers and ground water, said Scott Deshefy, one of
four inspectors in charge of monitoring the 13,500 underground
storage tanks in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Underground fuel tanks in New Jersey, the most densely populated
state in the country, have tainted hundreds of private and public
water wells, federal officials said.
</P>
<P>
   All state-owned tanks in New Jersey have been upgraded, said
Kevin Kratina, chief of New Jersey's Bureau of Underground Storage
Tanks. But in July 1997, the EPA fined the New Jersey Transit
Authority $130,000 for failing to install leak protection equipment
on tanks it had at several sites around the state.
</P>
<P>
   Business owners have also been caught grossly out of compliance
with the federal law.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, the EPA fined Gaseteria, a chain of gasoline
stations, $360,000 for tank leaks. On Thursday, the agency
announced that it was seeking to fine Supervalue, a supermarket
chain based in Spring Valley, N.Y., $261,595 for tank violations at
four locations in northern New Jersey. On May 30, a federal judge
ordered a gas station owner, Oliver Hill, to pay $4.75 million _
the largest fine ever imposed for tank violations _ for ignoring a
1995 EPA order to clean up 10,000 gallons of gasoline that leaked
from tanks buried under a station on the Onondaga reservation in
upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   Forcing owners of underground fuel tanks to comply with
regulations has been difficult because there are too few
inspectors, EPA officials said, with enforcement left primarily to
individual states.
</P>
<P>
   But effectively enforcing laws protecting ground water also has
been complicated by politics, federal and state officials said. For
example, in New York, unlike most states, the Legislature never
passed a law giving the State Department of Environmental
Conservation the power to enforce the EPA's tank-upgrade law, said
John Kushwara, the chief of the EPA's regional unit on ground water
compliance in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington politics has also hindered enforcement of the
national storage tank law, state and federal environmental
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Congress has overseen a fund, collected from taxes
paid by petroleum companies, to help states clean up large fuel
spills caused by underground storage tanks. Though the fund, called
the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund, currently has $1.3
billion in it, federal law permits the EPA to draw only about $70
million a year, roughly the amount the fund earns in interest each
year. That money can be used only to clean up spills, not to find
and close leaking tanks or enforce the current tank-upgrade
regulations, EPA officials said.
</P>
<P>
   EPA officials in Washington and petroleum industry executives
said the law should be changed to free up more money and to allow
it to be used to detect fuel-tank problems before they erupt into
disastrous spills.
</P>
<P>
   But federal and state environmental officials, as well as
several petroleum industry executives, said congressional leaders
had refused to touch the fund's $1.3 billion principal as part of
the effort to reduce the federal deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Changing the law to allocate money for more enforcement action
would go a long way toward better preventing ground water
contamination, environmentalists said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really know a lot more about how to prevent this,'' said
Epstein, the engineer with the Environmental Defense Fund. ``It's
just a matter of money, and it's a matter of will on the part of
the owner-operators, and the agencies in charge of enforcement.''

BEAR STEARNS CLOSES BOOK ON AN ILL-FATED TAKEOVER 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Bear Stearns Cos. has closed the books on one of the darker
chapters in its history as an investment bank by writing a check
for $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bear Stearns, the sixth-biggest U.S. securities firm, paid that
amount to settle a lawsuit over its role as an adviser on an
ill-fated takeover, lawyers involved in the case said Monday. The
case sent tremors through Wall Street two years ago when a federal
jury in California found the firm was negligent in the way it
advised its client, the Daisy Systems Corp., on a 1989 purchase of
Cadnetix Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The jury awarded $108 million in damages to the shareholders of
the two companies, both of which are now defunct. That was easily
the biggest award against an investment bank for giving bad advice
in a merger or acquisition, and it held up other bankers' opinions
to the scrutiny of jurors, securities-law experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the creditors of Daisy Systems, a software company,
had argued that Bear Stearns contributed to the failure of the
companies by telling them that it was ``highly confident'' that it
could line up financing for the highly leveraged transaction, said
John Coffee, a law professor at Columbia University, who testified
as an expert witness in the original trial. When the firm failed to
arrange bank loans, Daisy Systems had to borrow at interest rates
higher than it could afford, Coffee said.
</P>
<P>
   The judge later reduced the award to $36 million, but Bear
Stearns and the bankruptcy trustee for Daisy Systems appealed that
decision. Then, as those appeals headed for a mid-summer hearing,
Bear Stearns agreed to settle the case for even less. It paid $30
million and withdrew a bankruptcy-court claim for $2.5 million in
investment banking fees, said J. Thomas Hannan, a lawyer in San
Francisco for the trustee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot better than paying out $108 million _ and they had
use of the money for two years,'' said Jimmy Lynn, a lawyer in
Oklahoma City who defended Bear Stearns. ``Bear Stearns wanted to
be rid of the case, and the plaintiffs wanted to be rid of the
case.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn also defended Bear Stearns in a case in which a wealthy,
Canadian currency trader won a $167 million award against the firm
in May. A hearing for an appeal of that judgment, for which the
firm took a $96 million charge against its earnings last quarter,
is scheduled for Sept. 28 in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, Lynn
said.
</P>
<P>
   By settling, Bear Stearns averted the possibility of having to
pay much more, even having the original $108 million award
restored, Coffee said. But, he added, the firm also ruled out the
chance of having an appellate panel completely throw out the
original decision by finding there was not sufficient evidence to
hold Bear Stearns liable.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in the investment banking industry who weren't facing
this liability were hoping that it would be reversed,'' Coffee
said.
</P>
<P>
   They fear increased liability for what they say in the
``fairness opinions'' that they render on all mergers and
acquisitions, he said. Corporate directors insist on having
investment bankers sign off on proposed transactions to shield them
from liability if shareholders sue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investment bankers make very high fees for giving these
opinions,'' in part, because ``the law places great weight on
obtaining these opinions,'' Coffee said. ``As a matter of public
policy, we want some risk of liability to attach to these opinions
or else they're likely to be fabricated.''
</P>
<P>
   Hannan, the lawyer for the trustee, said the case was notable
because ``two companies died but the creditors will recover'' some
of their losses and because it laid down guidelines for the
responsibilities of investment bankers in mergers and acquisitions.
Coffee said the jury had found that investment bankers, like
doctors in medical matters, play a pivotal role in mergers and can
be liable for malpractice.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement is unlikely to have much of an effect on Bear
Stearns' earnings because the firm had already set aside money to
cover the larger, original damage award and will be able to use
what is left of that reserve to cover other legal costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There could be some reversal'' of the legal reserve in the
next quarter, said Joan Solotar, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette, ``but I would not imagine that it would be a total
reversal. They could either fully release the reserve or find some
other use for it.''

 CHILD CARE PROGRAMS BRING TAX BILLS DOWN TO SIZE
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; COLUMN BY ARTHUR LOUIS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2000 San Francisco Chronicle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q:My wife and I both work, and we plan to place our son in day
care. We will pay about $360 per month. How much of a tax break
would we get? I've heard about the dependent care tax credit but
don't understand it.
</P>
<P>
   A: Granted, it is somewhat complicated.
</P>
<P>
   The child and dependent care credit allows you to deduct from
your tax bill a certain percentage of the amount you pay for your
son's day care. However, it applies to no more than $2,400 per year
in day care expenses. (If you had two or more children in day care,
the cutoff would be $4,800.)
</P>
<P>
   Credits are different from _ and better than _ deductions.
Deductions reduce the amount of your taxable income. Credits
directly reduce the tax itself.
</P>
<P>
   If your income is no greater than $10,000, then you can reduce
your tax bill by 30 percent of $2,400 _ that is, $720. The
percentage is scaled down to 20 percent for families with incomes
of $28,000 or more. If you are making that much, your maximum
credit would be $480.
</P>
<P>
   You should check whether your employer or your wife's employer
offer a superior alternative. I'm referring to an IRS-approved
dependent-care assistance program that allows you to set aside up
to $5,000 of your income tax-free to pay day care expenses.
</P>
<P>
   If you are in the 28 percent tax bracket _ and if you are
fortunate enough to have an employer who sponsors such a program _
you can do better than you would with the child care credit.
</P>
<P>
   In your case, the $360 monthly day care expenses would amount to
$4,320 annually. If you don't have to pay taxes on that amount, you
will save $1,209.60 _ several hundred dollars more than you would
save with the child care credit.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; How Total Is Total? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Early last year, I bought 2,145 shares of a stock called
Shaman Pharmaceuticals for about $5,000. It was a bad investment,
and the stock fell so steeply that by midyear, the company declared
a 1-for-20 reverse split, leaving me with 107 shares. This year
there was another reverse split _ this time, 1-for-50 _ leaving me
with a mere 2 shares. Those shares recently were selling for about
11 cents apiece, so my investment has been just about wiped out.
Can I claim a total loss on my income tax?
</P>
<P>
   A: If the company's stock became permanently and totally
worthless, you could write it off as a total loss in the year it
happened, notes Internal Revenue Service spokesman Jesse Weller.
</P>
<P>
   But Shaman Pharmaceuticals, a South San Francisco company that
produces dietary supplements derived from tropical plants, still
has an active market for its stock. It had revenues last year of
about $1 million (and a $16 million loss), and the current market
value of all its outstanding shares is more than $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   You can, however, sell your stock _ all 22 cents' worth _ and
claim a capital loss on the transaction. Bear in mind that you
can't claim the full $5,000 loss in one year unless you offset it
against at least $2,000 in capital gains. If you end the year with
more than $3,000 in net capital losses, you have to carry the extra
amount over to the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, your broker probably will charge a commission far greater
than the value of your shares _ but that's not altogether bad.
Weller says you can count the commission as part of your capital
loss.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Treasury Bonds a Good Bet &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q: My parents are retired and of modest means. Each month they
receive a personal check of $400 from a family member to whom they
made a loan. I recommended that they put away that money as savings
in a low-risk investment such as Treasuries. But Treasury bonds
apparently require a $10,000 minimum investment. Is there some way
they can participate, perhaps through a mutual fund?
</P>
<P>
   A: Treasuries aren't just for the big boys anymore. It's true
that they used to be priced out of reach for many small investors,
but now you can buy them for $1,000 each. That's the case with all
kinds of Treasuries: bonds, which expire in 30 years, notes (two to
10 years) and bills (13 to 52 weeks).
</P>
<P>
   They are easy enough to buy.
</P>
<P>
   If your parents have access to the Internet, tell them to go to
the U.S. Treasury Department Web site at  &LR; www.treasurydirect.gov &LR; .
They will find all the how-to information they need to open an
account and buy Treasuries commission-free. The purchases can be
made over the Internet or by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   If they don't have access to the Internet, tell them to apply to
one of the regional Federal Reserve banks for the necessary forms
and information. In San Francisco, the number to call is (415)
974-2330.

BATTLE FOR CONTROL OF REFORM PARTY COMES TO SHOWDOWN 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LETITIA STEIN 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A long-simmering battle for control of the Reform
Party will come to a showdown over the next several days as party
members gathering in Long Beach, Calif., to nominate a candidate
for president.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the painstakingly scripted Republican and Democratic
conventions, a week of political infighting is expected to set the
stage for the formal selection of a Reform Party presidential
candidate at the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't so much that our party is in disarray,'' said Judy
Duffy, co-chair of the national convention committee. ``All parties
are in disarray. It's just usually done behind closed doors.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the stakes are high in the Reform Party contest: The
convention winner will land $12.6 million in federal money for the
fall campaign, as well as ideological control over the fractious
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will determine the future of the Reform Party,'' said
Michael Farris, chair of the presidential nominations committee.
``Will it keep faithful to our initial promise of a broad, third
party for independent voters, or will we become a narrow, extremist
conservative party?''
</P>
<P>
   Although the convention does not officially kick off until
Thursday, many delegates are gathering today for a meeting of the
party's national committee. The meeting pits Reform Party
traditionalists against the growing ``Buchananite'' wing,
supporters of conservative commentator Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   When he fell short last year in his third try for the Republican
Party presidential nomination, Buchanan abandoned the &UR;  &LR; GOP and
began organizing a social conservative movement within the Reform
Party.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan foes hope to block a conservative takeover by backing
challenger John Hagelin, a physicist who has twice run for
president on the Natural Law Party ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan predicted that if he is denied the nomination, the
Reform Party will wither and die.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't get this nomination, it is pretty much the end of
the Reform Party,'' the conservative commentator said Sunday in a
pre-convention interview on CBS' Face the Nation.
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party was organized by Dallas billionaire Ross Perot
after his third-place finish in the 1992 presidential election.
Perot, running as the Reform Party nominee in 1996, received about
9 percent of the vote, enough to qualify the party for federal
funding this year.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Perot is staying quiet and away from the party's
nominating convention. He has declined entreaties from his
supporters to block Buchanan by running this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party's warring factions are at odds over whether a
party founded principally for government reform should get involved
in the politics of social issues. The party has avoided taking an
official position on the most controversial social matters. But
Buchanan has angered some party loyalists with his conservative
views on abortion, homosexual rights and affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's turning the party into a right wing, conservative
fund-raising organization,'' said party secretary Jim Mangia. ``It
was supposed to be socially neutral, bringing together people from
different viewpoints and ideologies.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next week, the heated interparty feud could prove more
than ugly _ it could become dangerous. Mangia recently reported
receiving death threats from pro-Buchanan callers. Security forces
are being deployed to keep the peace during the convention or the
first political face-off at the national committee meeting this
morning.
</P>
<P>
   The committee could decide to overturn an earlier executive
committee motion to disqualify the Buchanan candidacy for alleged
voter fraud. More significantly, the committee will name the chair
to the powerful credentials committee, which decides which
delegates will be seated at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the anti-Buchanan forces have accused the candidate
of trying to stack this committee to gain the two-thirds majority
needed to overturn the primary results and take control of the
party platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect it will be contentious,'' said Russell Verney, a
former party chairman and Buchanan opponent. ``I think you'll see
very outspoken, passionate people fighting for the future of the
party.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Verney plans to challenge the Texas delegation,
which he claims was appointed in violation of party rules. At the
state convention in June, Buchanan supporters refused to seat
anti-Buchanan delegates from Dallas and Bexar counties on
parliamentary technicalities. &QL;

 PAC BELL CRACKS DOWN ON FIRMS TIED TO QUESTIONABLE BILLING
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; BY TODD WALLACK &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHRONICLE STAFF WRITER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2000 San Francisco Chronicle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Two years ago, John McDonald was stunned to find
a $35 charge on his phone bill from a company he'd never heard of _
a billing firm called USP&AMP;C.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a completely fictitious charge for voice mail,'' fumed
McDonald, a manufacturing engineer from Van Nuys (Los Angeles
County).
</P>
<P>
   In industry parlance, McDonald had just been ``crammed.'' Like
thousands of other customers in California, McDonald discovered
that a billing agent had shoved an unauthorized charge onto his
local phone bill.
</P>
<P>
   Although they don't actually handle any calls themselves,
billing companies ``aggregate'' charges from scores of tiny
telecommunications firms and hand them off to the local phone
companies that print your bill. Since late 1997, billing
aggregators have racked up thousands of complaints in California
for passing along phony charges from shady operators.
</P>
<P>
   But regulators and local phone companies are striking back,
effectively putting some billing agents such as USP&AMP;C out of
business in at least some states and forcing others to fix the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Bell, the dominant local phone company in Northern
California, stopped pass along charges from USP&AMP;C last fall, after
state regulators began a formal investigation into the complaints.
Ohio, meanwhile, expelled the Kansas City, Mo., firm from its
borders altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Other billing firms are under fire. Ohio sued Telephone Billing
Services (TBS) of Las Vegas and HBS Billing Services of San Antonio
for cramming. And the Federal Trade Commission forced HBS to cough
up a $125,000 settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Billing companies insist they are simply caught in the middle.
Executives say they have no way to know the charges are phony until
consumers receive their bills and call to complain.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the crackdown appears to be working.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Complaints Drop &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Complaints against billing firms dropped by more than two-thirds
during the past year in California. State regulators logged 884
complaints in 1999, down from more than 3,000 in 1998, according to
a Chronicle analysis of complaints filed with the state Public
Utilities Commission. Even fewer complaints are coming in so far
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, two of the worst offenders appear to have shut down
altogether: International Telemedia Associates of Atlanta and TBS
in Las Vegas, also known as Long Distance Billing Co.
</P>
<P>
   Other billing agents have been forced to shed troublesome
clients, such as psychic hotlines and X-rated 900 numbers, to keep
regulators at bay.
</P>
<P>
   The whole industry has become more scrutinized over the past 18
to 24 months,'' said Michael Hynes, spokesman for Billing Concepts,
another billing service. ``Finally, it got to the point where we
had to do something. We had to fire a lot of customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, Billing Concepts has reduced complaints by
two-thirds in California, and some rivals have had even more
success. Integretel, which drew 536 PUC complaints in 1998,
received just 40 last year. Both HBS and the Operator Assistance
Network in Northridge (Los Angeles County) also reduced complaints
by more than 90 percent in California during the same time period.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt the crackdown has helped,'' said Pac Bell
spokesman John Britton. Whenever Pac Bell receives too many
complaints about a billing company in a quarter, it now puts the
firms on probation, warning that it will begin refusing to pass
along the company's charges unless complaints go down.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, complaints haven't dried up altogether.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Most Complaints &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Billing Concepts, which bills customers under the names U.S.
Billing, Zero Plus Dialing and ESBI, still drew 239 complaints in
1999, more than any other firm.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  But Billing Concepts says it controls 65 percent of the
market, so it should be expected to generate more complaints. And
executives insist charges are usually legitimate, even when
customers squeal.
</P>
<P>
   Bridget McQueen, a spokeswoman for San Jose billing firm
Integretel, insists that billing agents often won't find out about
a scam until customers receive their bills and complaints flood in.
</P>
<P>
   Billing Concept's Zero Plus Dialing division, for instance,
frequently draws fire because it passes along hefty charges for
calls placed at no-name pay phones. Since most states do not cap
the rates for calls from independent pay phones, consumers are
often stunned when the bill arrives.
</P>
<P>
   One customer complained on an Internet message board that he was
billed $381.47 for four collect calls from Mexico totaling less
than an hour. And two parents were floored when they were billed
$35.11 for two short collect calls from their daughter, who was
returning from a church camp in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, the customers blamed Zero Plus Dialing, instead
of the phone company that handled the call _ possibly because the
billing company's name is usually the only one to appear on the
local phone bill.
</P>
<P>
   But Jacquelene Mitchell, a Billing Concepts vice president,
insists customers could have avoided a nasty surprise had they
bothered to ask about the rates up front before placing a collect
call or agreeing to accept the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even when charges are incorrect, billing agents claim they
are just caught in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Difficult Clients &LR;
</P>
<P>
   USP&AMP;C lawyer Sheldon Krantz, for instance, blamed the company's
539 complaints in 1998 on a few troublesome clients, which he said
USP&AMP;C no longer works with. But in a complaint filed in October,
state regulators accused the company of violating state rules by
not clearly describing the charges and refusing to provide
information to the PUC. The probe has not been completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a tendency to automatically believe any allegation,''
Krantz said, ``but this is a very good company trying to do a very
good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Billing Concepts has suffered, too. Sales for the latest quarter
fell 19 percent to $29 million. And Profits, excluding its Internet
operations and special charges, shrank by $6.5 million to $700,000
during the past three months.
</P>
<P>
   Other firms fared worse and are going out of business.
</P>
<P>
   TBS, also known as Long Distance Billing Co., logged 141
complaints in California last year, more than any other company
except for Billing Concepts of San Antonio. The company did not
return phone calls. And Dean Kajioka, the lawyer listed on the
company's corporate charter filed with the state of Nevada, refused
to say whether the company is still operating. ``I don't know if I
can say that,'' Kajioka said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, ITA, which sparked 276 gripes in 1998 alone, hasn't
generated a single complaint in more than a year. Two industry
executives said that's because the firm shut down. The Chronicle
could not find any telephone listing or Web site for the firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an example of when a company bills for (troublesome)
clients, it can end up being their demise,'' said Sandy McGreevy,
Pac Bell's general manager of consumer protection.
</P>
<P>
   McGreevy said local phone companies such as Pac Bell are
increasingly willing to automatically remove charges from billing
companies whenever customers complain _ cutting off their main
source of revenue. Pac Bell, for instance, has set up a call center
with 200 people in Redding (Shasta County) to field complaints
about charges from other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Now some billing agents complain that phone companies and
regulators could go too far _ refusing to accept charges for
anything other than phone calls.

 COMPLEX FORMULAS LET LONG-DISTANCE SERVICE BEEF UP PHONE CHARGES
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; BY TODD WALLACK &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHRONICLE STAFF WRITER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2000 San Francisco Chronicle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Gail DeLong says she was offered a long-distance
deal too good to refuse: less than 8 cents a minute during business
hours.
</P>
<P>
   But the great rates evaporated after two months. Starting with
the third bill, the phone company suddenly started billing her in a
mysterious unit called ``TCUs'' (total call units) instead of
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Although she didn't notice at first, the company, NOS
Communications, started multiplying the length of every call by an
unusual formula to include overhead costs. A nine-minute phone
call, for instance, would translate into 18.5 TCUs _ essentially
doubling her rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so misleading,'' said DeLong, an oil broker who lives in
San Francisco. She said she was never told about the TCU billing
method when she signed up.
</P>
<P>
   DeLong is hardly alone. State regulators in California and
across the country have received scores of similar complaints. And
attorneys in at least four states have filed class-action lawsuits
on behalf of former NOS customers, accusing the Las Vegas firm of
pulling off an elaborate bait-and-switch.
</P>
<P>
   In court documents filed in June, San Francisco law firm Girard
&AMP; Green likened NOS to a service station that advertises gasoline
for $1 per gallon _ then charges $1 per quart. ``Their entire
business is based  &LR;   &LR; on scamming customers,'' said Charles Carbone,
a consumer attorney for the law firm.
</P>
<P>
   However, NOS attorneys say the company has never been fined or
sanctioned. They also have an easy way to swat away the lawsuits
with a simple defense:
</P>
<P>
   Its unorthodox rates are spelled out in a thick set of legal
documents, called tariffs, filed with the Federal Communications
Commission and the California Public Utilities Commission. Legally,
companies are not required to tell consumers about key details as
long as they are mentioned in the tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   So even if NOS salespeople never mention that the low rates they
are quoting will last for only two months, subscribers are still on
the hook. ``Customers need to ask,'' said Danny Adams, a Washington
lawyer who represents NOS.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints against NOS illustrate one of the downsides to
relaxed regulation in the long-distance market. With relatively few
standards in place, companies have developed a stunningly
complicated array of pricing plans, often laden with hidden fees
and catches.
</P>
<P>
   However, because the old tariff system in still in place _ a
vestige of the monopoly days when regulators closely scrutinized
rates _ customers often have little recourse when they are misled.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Four Investigations &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Still, NOS stands out. So many customers have complained
that the FCC and state regulators in California, Florida and
Wisconsin are investigating NOS. ``They advertise 7.9 cents per
minute, but bill at 7.9 cents per TCU,'' said Steven Foemmel, a
Wisconsin consumer protection investigator.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  In California, both the attorney general and the state PUC
have contacted NOS to investigate the allegations, Adams confirmed.
The PUC received 334 complaints about the firm last year, according
to a Chronicle analysis, an astonishing figure for a long-distance
company with only 175,000 customers nationwide. Sprint, with at
least 20 times more subscribers, drew only 40 percent more gripes.
</P>
<P>
   DeLong, who filed a complaint with the PUC a year ago, said she
noticed the rate she was quoted was listed as ``promotional'' in
the fine print of a one-page flyer the company faxed her. But when
she asked about it, she insists she was told ``these would be the
rates I would see all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   In a Florida case last year, NOS confirmed a sales agent misled
a customer about the promotional period. ``We have reviewed the
tape,'' an NOS lawyer wrote the state, ``and regrettably, the agent
did indeed respond incorrectly to (the customer's) inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams, the NOS lawyer, insists those are exceptions. He said the
company installed a $5 million tape recording system, in part, to
make sure telemarketers do not give misleading information.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not some rogue company trying to make a quick buck,''
Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said, telemarketers are supposed to use phrases
such as ``limited time offer'' to make it clear the initial rates
are only good for a few months. But customers could easily
interpret that to mean they must sign up right away to receive the
low rates.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; When Asked, Don't Tell &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In addition, two former NOS sales workers said they were ordered
not to tell prospective customers about the TCU billing method. If
people asked, they were instructed to transfer the calls to a
special department. (Adams confirmed the policy.)
</P>
<P>
   Once customers sign up for the service, Adams said, all the
details are spelled out clearly in a ``welcome kit.''
</P>
<P>
   To convert minutes into TCUs, Adams said, the company multiplies
the number of minutes by 2 and adds 0.5 for calls that are 20
minutes or less. For longer calls, the company adds 20.5. The
company then multiplies the number of TCUs by the same rate
initially quoted to customers for the ``per minute'' costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it boils down to is that you are paying twice as much as
you think you are,'' said Dan Baldwin, a former NOS customer in San
Diego, who set up a Web site critical of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Adams insists that's an exaggeration. Although short phone calls
are roughly doubled or more, longer ones are increased by a smaller
percentage. The price of a 40-minute phone call, for example, works
out to only 51 percent more.
</P>
<P>
   And even with the increase, Adams insists, the rates are a good
deal for many business customers, who often pay higher rates than
residential callers.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of his, Glenn Lloyd in San Carlos, said he also
couldn't decipher the surcharges on his NOS bill. ``There was zero
explanation,'' Lloyd said, ``and if you called the 800 number, you
couldn't actually talk to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   However, even a former NOS president, Neal Bobys, could not
explain the company's billing method under oath.
</P>
<P>
   In a deposition taken in October, a Florida attorney asked Bobys
for the price of a one-minute call at 14.9 cents per minute. Bobys
couldn't give a precise figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``More is the answer,'' Bobys said, referring to the 14.9 cents.
Bobys said the final price would also have to include ``equivalent
call units based on the tariff.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a state representative from Milwaukee found the billing
method so confusing that he proposed legislation requiring
telephone companies to charge by the minute. Just to be safe, he
also defined a minute as 60 seconds long.
</P>
<P>
   But lobbyists from AT&AMP;T and other major long-distance companies
helped defeat a Senate version of the bill in March over concerns
that the legislation would also ban rounding. Phone companies often
round calls up to the nearest minute, so a 61-second call would
still be billed as two full minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In no other industry do you have that,'' said state Rep.
Sheldon Wasserman, who entered the debate after his brother felt
burned by NOS. ``Go to any state and a quart is always a quart.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Going After Overseas Callers &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, NOS targeted small and midsize businesses,
employing vast banks of telemarketers to sign up customers. But
more recently, NOS also set up an ``ethnic call center'' in Los
Angeles to recruit customers who make frequent overseas phone
calls, especially to China, South Korea and the Philippines; the
lion's share of those 75,000 customers live in California, Adams
said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many of the complaints in the Bay Area came from San
Francisco residents with Asian surnames, the PUC data show.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Adams said, NOS started charging those residential
customers a $25 ``termination fee'' if they switched to another
long-distance carrier after less than six months. Plus, NOS boosted
the rates for customers' final bill.
</P>
<P>
   But NOS never told customers about the termination fee in
advance. Although technically legal, because NOS inserted the
change in its tariff, many customers were caught off-guard and
complained to the PUC.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said the company received so many complaints that it gave
all the customers refunds and eliminated the termination fee after
six months.
</P>
<P>
   Adams also said NOS recently agreed to stop pitching
introductory rates in ``cents per minute'' to appease the FCC.
Instead, the company plans to tell customers up front they will be
charged by the calling unit.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said NOS actually started implementing the change in June
but said it will take several months to teach all the telemarketers
the new pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company has tried to respond to criticisms and made a lot
of refinements,'' Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Numerous Names &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Despite the complaints, NOS says it is growing at a torrid pace.
The company's Web site boasts it is now a ``$400 million
telecommunications giant'' with more than 3,000 salespeople in Las
Vegas and Los Angeles. The company also operates under a half-dozen
other names, including Affinity Network, QuantumLink
Communications, HorizonOne Communications and the Internet Business
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, NOS touts its ties to WorldCom, the country's
second-largest long-distance company.
</P>
<P>
   But WorldCom spokeswoman Linda Laughlin denied the companies are
partners. She said WorldCom must sell its service to NOS, like any
other customer, regardless of how many complaints it receives. ``We
are not the police patrol,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The real telecom police, however, appear poised to step in. The
Florida Public Service Commission, for instance, has proposed
fining NOS $300,000, said PSC spokesman Mark Swanson.
</P>
<P>
   Swanson said staffers believe that NOS' ``unorthodox rate
structures, conversion charts and rates'' might violate two state
rules. One bars utilities from misleading customers. Another says
tariffs must be written in simple language and ``avoid
unnecessarily long, complicated or obscure phrases.'' (Girard &AMP;
Green, the San Francisco law firm, made this same argument.) But
Swanson said NOS has responded to the allegations, and staff
members are now mulling over what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Wisconsin's consumer protection agency last week
recommended the state's attorney general prosecute NOS for false
advertising, overbilling customers and slamming, or switching
customers' service without permission.
</P>
<P>
   Any fines, however, would come too late for DeLong and her
husband. She said the couple lost hundreds of dollars because they
were promised rates they never received.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were awful,'' she said.

 BOFA EXEC PLANS FOR PROMOTION
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; BY SAM ZUCKERMAN &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHRONICLE STAFF WRITER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2000 San Francisco Chronicle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Get ready for a corporate makeover at Bank of
America as it prepares to enter the post-Hugh McColl era.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Monday at San Francisco's Hyatt Regency Hotel,
Kenneth Lewis, the odds-on favorite to be the bank's next chief
executive, said giant corporate takeovers, cronyism and Southern
regional chauvinism will be out under his leadership. In will be
efficiency, profitability and an open corporate style.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, 53, the bank's president and No. 2 executive, sounded
very much like a man who has passed his career in the shadow of a
domineering leader and is struggling to find his own voice.
</P>
<P>
   McColl, of course, is the corporate titan who built his little
North Carolina bank into the nation's largest through an audacious
series of takeovers. Two years ago, McColl capped his career when
NationsBank bought San Francisco's BofA, took its name and elbowed
aside the California bank's leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the 65-year-old McColl is easing his way toward retirement,
something bank watchers believe could happen at the end of this
year or early next year. While Lewis' appointment is not official,
few doubt he will get the job.
</P>
<P>
   As McColl fades and Lewis emerges, the bank is going through a
seismic shift in strategy. Lewis is swearing off the kind of
megamergers McColl used to build BofA in favor of the more mundane
task of making the bank more efficient and profitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year we have been adding a bank,`` Lewis noted. Now, he
said, the bank needs ``a new model that is customer-centric as
opposed to acquisition-centric.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are creating a different kind of company than we have ever
been before,`` Lewis stressed.
</P>
<P>
   The change Lewis is pushing is sorely needed, Wall Street
analysts said. McColl's focus on growth made BofA a force to be
reckoned with, but it produced lackluster profits and weak stock
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been on an acquisition tear for many years, but
they've come to the end of the road,'' said Sutro &AMP; Co. analyst
Campbell Chaney. ``Now they have got to look internally to find
earnings growth.``
</P>
<P>
   But it's not only strategy Lewis said he will remake. It's also
the bank's insular culture.
</P>
<P>
   McColl packed BofA's board and top executive ranks with an
unswervingly loyal group of buddies, all from the South. The
Mississippi-born Lewis, handpicked by McColl as his successor, said
he will end that practice, though he was careful not to criticize
his mentor.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said he will select executives regardless of whether they
are NationsBank veterans or from other banks. And as current
directors retire, the bank will be ``very focused on broadening
board representation geographically,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis's claim of a new day at BofA isn't made any easier by
recent events, all of which took place under his supervision.
</P>
<P>
   In the past month, the bank's corporate and global banking unit
has demoted most top managers from the old BofA. San Francisco's
Northern California retail banking regional headquarters has been
shut and its functions combined with a similar office in Los
Angeles. And a cutback of up to 10,000 management jobs swept away
former California Treasurer Kathleen Brown, one of the old BofA's
most visible female executives.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said job cuts are needed to meet the bank's profit targets
as it moves away from big acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   And he stressed the bank's commitment to the Bay Area market.
``It's the market in which we do best. The growth rate is higher
than anywhere else in the country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   BofA's president didn't comment specifically on what kind of
organization the bank will keep in San Francisco, but he said the
bank plans to keep its Concord computer center open for the
foreseeable future. ``Concord is a very important center for us and
will continue to be so,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' style is bland, and he doesn't seem the sort to feed the
kind of cult of personality that built up around McColl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to build the best brand in financial service,'' Lewis
said. ``I want the brand to overwhelm any individual.''

ISRAELIS HAIL SELECTION OF LIEBERMAN 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH HORAN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israelis on Monday hailed the selection of Sen.
Joseph Lieberman as Al Gore's running mate, while Palestinians
worried that the Connecticut legislator's tough pro-Israel stance
could be an impediment to peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, D-Conn., an Orthodox Jew, has consistently stood
behind Israel during peace negotiations with the Palestinians and
Syrians, often joining ranks with other pro-Israel senators to bash
the administration's Middle East policy.
</P>
<P>
   Notably, in 1997, Lieberman wrote a letter to President Clinton
in which the senator called Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat a
``villain'' and slammed the administration's policy of
``even-handedness'' in Mideast peacemaking, which Lieberman said
had not been earned by the Palestinians. Four Republican senators
also signed the letter.
</P>
<P>
   That record of strong support for Israel would make Lieberman's
candidacy for vice president an attractive choice for many people
here, said Leslie Susser, an Israeli commentator and diplomatic
correspondent for the English-language Jerusalem Report.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like a dream ticket for Israel,'' said Susser.
``Lieberman, who is a Zionist, who knows Israel very well, would
probably be very sympathetic to Israel's needs, a continuation to
the very favorable terms of the Clinton presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials here declined comment on Gore's choice of
Lieberman. One official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
only that ``as a member of the Senate, (Lieberman) has shown a deep
interest in the Middle East peace process and is a regular visitor
to the region.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman last visited Israel in June.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, those same pro-Israel qualities may not sit too
well with a portion of the Israeli public, Susser said. Some
Israelis might worry that Lieberman could be an impediment to
progress in negotiations with Palestinians _ a fear shared by many
Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some Israelis feel that perhaps a Gore-Lieberman ticket would
be too pro-Israeli and that could lead to Israeli intransigence and
a slowdown in the peace process,'' Susser said. ``It could lead to
the relationship between Israel and the Arabs being more difficult
than it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Palestinians said they already were worried that Gore's
strong pro-Israel stand during his years as a Tennessee senator and
then as vice president would leave them at a disadvantage in
peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of Lieberman, they said, would increase Arab
skepticism about America's ability to maintain its role as a
neutral facilitator of the peace talks that have been reduced to a
low level since Israelis and Palestinians failed to reach an
agreement during 15 days of intensive negotiations at Camp David
last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bad news for the Palestinians, but it's in no way a
surprise,'' said Ghassan Khatib, a Palestinian political analyst
who directs the Jerusalem Media and Communication Center. ``We've
got enough bias statements from the vice president, so it's bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an impression of him being so biased and supportive to
Israel,`` Khatib said.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli politicians here said they did not expect Lieberman's
Jewish background to affect American foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is that the United States is behind Israel, behind
the peace process, and also for a fair settlement ... which will
give Palestinians freedom and security, and I am sure that is
independent of being a Jew or a non-Jew,'' said Michael Melchior,
an ultra-Orthodox Jew and Israel's minister of diaspora affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Melchior said, Lieberman's nomination was evidence that
the American people had come of age.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very proud that American society has matured to this
point that a Jew, that is a conscious Jew, a religious Jew, can be
a candidate of this high position,'' Melchior said. &QL;

PRACTICE SESSION LAST WEEK PAYS OFF FOR SIDOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. _ Anne-Gaelle Sidot and Ai Sugiyama
played a practice set together last week in Carlsbad, oblivous to
the possibility they would meet for real Monday in the first round
of the estyle.com Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her it had been a long time since we played each
other,'' Sidot said. ``Then I saw the draw and I saw Sugiyama and I
was surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   The friendly rivalry didn't make for much drama. Sidot went up a
break early in each set, cruised to a 6-3, 6-4 victory at the
Manhattan Country Club, and set up a second-round matchup with
second-seeded Lindsay Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   Sidot, a native of France, is trying to match her breakout 1999
season, when she finished a career-best 27th in the world and
reached the semifinals at Manhattan Beach and three other
tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Sidot has reached the quarterfinals of just three tournaments
this year but seemed enthused with a victory over an opponent whose
game she respects a great deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Sugiyama) has improved a lot,'' Sidot said. ``Last year she
was not as early on the ball, but now she's more aggressive. If
you're not ready with your legs, it's too late. The ball is going
to come fast.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Survivors:!end! The singles main draw was completed Monday
afternoon when four players advanced out of the 32-player
qualifying tournament.
</P>
<P>
   In the final qualifying matches, Marlene Weingartner of Germany
beat American Meghann Shaughnessy 6-4, 7-5; Tamarine Tanasugarn
beat American Kristina Brandi 0-6, 6-3, 6-4; Daja Bedanova of the
Czech Republic beat Maureen Drake of Canada 7-5, 6-3, and Tatiana
Panova of Russia beat Cara Black of Zimbabwe 3-6, 6-4, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   The best match of the day was the first on center court. Brandi
blitzed Tanasugarn in the first set with a strong serve and
consistently accurate ground strokes and broke serve to open the
second set. But she couldn't maintain the same high level of play.
Both players' games were plagued by frequent unforced errors in the
third set, but Tanasugarn's serve was strong enough to hold off
Brandi.
</P>
<P>
   Tanasugarn's first-round opponent will be Spain's Magui Serna,
who avoided the qualifying tournament and joined the main draw on
Friday, when Anke Huber withdrew because of an elbow injury. The
players met two years ago in the first round at Manhattan Beach,
and Serna won in three sets.
</P>
<P>
   __ Can't beat the heat: Warm and humid weather increased the
sale of bottled water and led to a few overheated players.
</P>
<P>
   Nathalie Dechy of France dropped the first set and the first
game of the second set to Russia's Elena Dementieva. Then WTA
officials examined her for possible heat exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   After a 10-minute rest, Dechy came back to win the next three
games and eventually tie the match with a second-set victory, but
Dementieva went up a service break early in the third set and won
6-4, 4-6, 6-4, to advance and face third-seeded Monica Seles in the
second round.

NETWORKS HAVE A BIZARRE GRIP ON REALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've got it, we'll televise a beauty pageant and let the
contestants pick their own winner, Darwin style.
</P>
<P>
   One contestant from each state. They're all locked in a
dormitory, see, and they do talent shows, and swimsuit
competitions, and world peace platitude contests, and are tempted
with chocolates, and form nasty alliances.
</P>
<P>
   Every week, five of them get booted out. The eventual winner
gets a million dollars, a crown, a sash, a ton of endorsement deals
and probably more attention than Miss America.
</P>
<P>
   Unsavory? Maybe, but it's practically ``Masterpiece Theatre''
compared with ``Chains of Love,'' the reality show NBC is pursuing.
</P>
<P>
   Developed by the makers of ``Big Brother,'' ``Chains of Love''
involves four men shackled to one woman, who turns them loose one
at a time until she holds the key to one stud's heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``It almost seems there's no idea too crazy these days,'' says
Mike Darnell, executive vice president for specials and alternative
programming at the Fox network, and a man who knows crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Darnell took heat for ``Who Wants to Marry a
Multi-Millionaire?'' But the fiasco that followed the onstage
marriage of Rick Rockwell and Darva Conger obscured something
noticed by programmers at every other network _ that February
special on Fox was a smash hit, and perversely riveting.
</P>
<P>
   It also proved that people will do (set ital)anything(end ital)
to be on TV, for the right price or the right exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Then came ``Survivor,'' this summer's top-rated program, and
``Big Brother.'' The race was on. Hollywood was suddenly
chockablock in wild ideas for TV reality shows.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the concepts that have been pitched to the networks:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Temptation,'' described as ``Change of Heart'' meets ``Blind
Date'' meets ``Survivor.'' Four couples in long-term relationships,
but not married, are sent to a Club Med-type resort where three
``dream dates'' are arranged for everyone to test their romantic
resolve.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Love Test,'' a similar idea except that men and women are
sent to separate resorts, where tempters and temptresses try to
seduce them. Andrea Wong, ABC vice president for alternative
programming, says the amazing thing is that ``the men know they're
being filmed but they do it anyway.'' Of course they do; they're
guys.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Glass House,'' a sort of ``Big Brother'' cousin, in which
contestants live in a glass house situated in a public park. In
other words, they're on display much like animals in a zoo. The
house keeps shrinking because every time a participant is banished,
a room is demolished.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Boot Camp,'' in which masochistic volunteers are subjected
to tests of physical stamina and plenty of verbal abuse from
military-style drill instructors. Fox has picked it up for future
broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Mole,'' in which contestants try to perform appointed
tasks while a saboteur in their midst tries to undermine their
efforts. Contestants have to try to identify the ``mole.'' It's
under development for ABC.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Popstars,'' based on a popular Australian series and
revolving around a Spice Girls-type band, from the band's inception
to the release of its first CD. Even though ``Making the Band''
didn't post big numbers on ABC, the WB network has picked up
``Popstars'' for midseason.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Reality Check'' is a concept similar to ``Popstars,'' but
this one chronicles the lives of would-be journalists as they
prepare stories for their own TV program. It's under development
for the WB, where programming chief Susanne Daniels regards it as a
blend of ``Primetime Live'' and ``The Real World.'' Daniels wants
to change the title.
</P>

NETWORKS HAVE A BIZARRE GRIP ON REALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've got it, we'll televise a beauty pageant and let the
contestants pick their own winner, Darwin style.
</P>
<P>
   One contestant from each state. They're all locked in a
dormitory, see, and they do talent shows, and swimsuit
competitions, and world peace platitude contests, and are tempted
with chocolates, and form nasty alliances.
</P>
<P>
   Every week, five of them get booted out. The eventual winner
gets a million dollars, a crown, a sash, a ton of endorsement deals
and probably more attention than Miss America.
</P>
<P>
   Unsavory? Maybe, but it's practically ``Masterpiece Theatre''
compared with ``Chains of Love,'' the reality show NBC is pursuing.
</P>
<P>
   Developed by the makers of ``Big Brother,'' ``Chains of Love''
involves four men shackled to one woman, who turns them loose one
at a time until she holds the key to one stud's heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``It almost seems there's no idea too crazy these days,'' says
Mike Darnell, executive vice president for specials and alternative
programming at the Fox network, and a man who knows crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Darnell took heat for ``Who Wants to Marry a
Multi-Millionaire?'' But the fiasco that followed the onstage
marriage of Rick Rockwell and Darva Conger obscured something
noticed by programmers at every other network _ that February
special on Fox was a smash hit, and perversely riveting.
</P>
<P>
   It also proved that people will do (set ital)anything(end ital)
to be on TV, for the right price or the right exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Then came ``Survivor,'' this summer's top-rated program, and
``Big Brother.'' The race was on. Hollywood was suddenly
chockablock in wild ideas for TV reality shows.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the concepts that have been pitched to the networks:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Temptation,'' described as ``Change of Heart'' meets ``Blind
Date'' meets ``Survivor.'' Four couples in long-term relationships,
but not married, are sent to a Club Med-type resort where three
``dream dates'' are arranged for everyone to test their romantic
resolve.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Love Test,'' a similar idea except that men and women are
sent to separate resorts, where tempters and temptresses try to
seduce them. Andrea Wong, ABC vice president for alternative
programming, says the amazing thing is that ``the men know they're
being filmed but they do it anyway.'' Of course they do; they're
guys.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Glass House,'' a sort of ``Big Brother'' cousin, in which
contestants live in a glass house situated in a public park. In
other words, they're on display much like animals in a zoo. The
house keeps shrinking because every time a participant is banished,
a room is demolished.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Boot Camp,'' in which masochistic volunteers are subjected
to tests of physical stamina and plenty of verbal abuse from
military-style drill instructors. Fox has picked it up for future
broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Mole,'' in which contestants try to perform appointed
tasks while a saboteur in their midst tries to undermine their
efforts. Contestants have to try to identify the ``mole.'' It's
under development for ABC.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Popstars,'' based on a popular Australian series and
revolving around a Spice Girls-type band, from the band's inception
to the release of its first CD. Even though ``Making the Band''
didn't post big numbers on ABC, the WB network has picked up
``Popstars'' for midseason.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Reality Check'' is a concept similar to ``Popstars,'' but
this one chronicles the lives of would-be journalists as they
prepare stories for their own TV program. It's under development
for the WB, where programming chief Susanne Daniels regards it as a
blend of ``Primetime Live'' and ``The Real World.'' Daniels wants
to change the title.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Runner,'' in which contestants must make their way
across the United States without being recognized and captured by
alert viewers. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are developing it for
ABC.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Endurance,'' an American version of the Japanese game show
in which contestants willingly endure all kinds of physical torment
and personal indignities. Apparently no takers yet.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Hotel Getaway,'' where unknowing ``contestants'' are awarded
free hotel vacations by friends who are in on the scam. The
destination turns out to be a Hotel Hell, where things go horribly
awry. Last dope to check out is the winner.

</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Big Diet,'' a ``Big Brother''-type endurance test for

CISNEROS LEAVING UNIVISISON TO RUN HOUSING COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
  By MIREYA NAVARRO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Henry Cisneros, the former housing secretary in the Clinton
administration who became president and chief operating officer of
the largest Spanish-language television broadcaster in the United
States, announced Monday that he was leaving the company, Univision
Communications Inc., to run a company that will build affordable
housing in downtown areas.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros is returning to his hometown of San Antonio, where he
served as mayor from 1981 to 1989, to become a partner with one of
the nation's largest homebuilders, Kaufman and Broad Home Corp.,
for his new venture. Cisneros said in a telephone interview that
his company, American CityVista, will identify areas that have been
overlooked by major homebuilders but are centrally located in order
to build residential communities, or ``villages within cities,'' at
affordable market prices.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was welcomed by Texas Democrats, who have
fallen on such hard times they currently hold no statewide office.
The possibility that Cisneros would run for office again, perhaps
governor, is tantalizing in the eyes of those who say Cisneros'
star power remains strong in Texas despite the scandal involving
payments to his former mistress that drove him out of national
politics. Last September, Cisneros pleaded guilty to one
misdemeanor count of lying to the FBI about the payments and was
fined $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   But Cisneros has denied any desire to run for public office
again. At 53, he said, he had been looking instead for ``an
entrepreneurial opportunity'' that would satisfy both his public
service and business inclinations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This represents a melding of mission and business,'' he said.
``Providing housing for people is as close as public service as you
can get.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, political experts said, Cisneros can considerably help
lift his party by using his charisma and fund-raising abilities to
help elect Democrats in 2002, when the statewide offices will be on
the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   As Univision's president and chief operating officer since 1997,
Cisneros focused on selling the broadcaster to leading advertisers.
The company, which has experienced tremendous growth in both
advertising and revenue as the rapidly growing Latino population
expands viewership, reaches more than 90 percent of the Hispanic
television audience in the United States through 33 broadcast and
1,093 cable affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts who follow the publicly-traded company said Cisneros
played a critical role in penetrating multinational advertisers.
But they said that Univision has a good management team and that
Cisneros' departure should not affect the company's operations or
growth in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   After the resignation announcement, Univision stock was down
$4.31, or 3.54 percent, to $117.56 while that of Kaufman &AMP; Broad
Home Corp. rose $2.62, or 13.04 percent, to $22.75.
</P>
<P>
   Univision is headed by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer A.
Jerrold Perenchio, a Hollywood dealmaker and major Republican Party
donor who led the group of investors that bought the network from
Hallmark Cards Inc. in 1992. Perenchio, who has assumed Cisneros'
responsibilities, said in a written statement that Cisneros'
``efforts on behalf of Univision were instrumental in our
development and he will certainly be missed.''

GUINNESS' ACTING DID THE TALKING 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB GRAHAM  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alec Guinness hid inside his roles. A recluse, he also hid in
life. He lived in the imagination.
</P>
<P>
   In one of life's little tricks, the shy actor, who died Saturday
in England at the age of 86, became famous throughout the world and
across the generations for a role he came to dislike, Obi-Wan
Kenobi in ``Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   The public's strong identification of him with the role surely
played a big part in his aversion to it. He also had no truck with
the pop mysticism that slopped over from Obi-Wan Kenobi onto
himself.
</P>
<P>
   There were consolations. Director George Lucas shared the ``Star
Wars'' bonanza, and Guinness reportedly got 2.25 percent of the
profits from the 1977 blockbuster. The actor went on to appear in
the sequels, ``The Empire Strikes Back'' (1980) and ``Return of the
Jedi'' (1983).
</P>
<P>
   Guinness was an unprepossessing figure, a drawback for a leading
man but no disadvantage at all for a character actor. From the
beginning of his film career, he was a master of disguise.
</P>
<P>
   He was more in the English theatrical tradition of John Gielgud,
his mentor, who died in May, rather than that of their great
contemporary, Laurence Olivier. The primary tool of Guinness'
craft, apart from disguise, was the compelling voice, in contrast
to the presence and force of personality, the charisma of an
Olivier.
</P>
<P>
   Guinness was anti-charisma.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from Obi-Wan Kenobi, he was known for his films since the
end of World War II, eccentric little English comedies and enormous
David Lean spectacles as well as an extraordinary range of leading
character roles, including that of the bunkered Fuhrer in ``Hitler:
The Last Ten Days'' (1973).
</P>
<P>
   He won an Academy Award for best actor as the monomaniacal Col.
Nicholson in Lean's ``The Bridge on the River Kwai'' (1957).
Guinness fans have their own favorite characterizations. Among them
are the anarchistic painter Gulley Jimson in ``The Horse's Mouth''
(1958), for which Guinness also wrote the screenplay, and the
Scottish military man, Lt. Col. Jock Sinclair, who is being
squeezed out of command in ``Tunes of Glory'' (1960).
</P>
<P>
   The portrayal of the tightly wound Scot might have been as close
as Guinness ever got to revealing anything personal onscreen. The
illegitimate son of a 60ish Scottish father he saw only a few times
and was taught to call Uncle, the young Guinness was reared by his
mother and spent much of his childhood by himself. The seeds of his
imaginative life were planted there.
</P>
<P>
   The Lean connection was a long one. It began with two Charles
Dickens adaptations, ``Great Expectations'' (1946) and ``Oliver
Twist'' (1948), and continued through the grand, literary-based
spectacles after ``Kwai.'' He was the Arab revolutionary leader
Prince Feisal in ``Lawrence of Arabia'' (1962), the storyteller
Yevgraf in Boris Pasternak's ``Doctor Zhivago'' (1965) and,
finally, the canny old Brahmin, Godbole, in E.M. Forster's ``A
Passage to India'' (1984).
</P>
<P>
   The creation of Fagin in ``Oliver Twist'' in 1948 was followed
the next year by his most famous feat of disguise, all eight
members of an aristocratic family who are being knocked off one by
one by a serial killer in ``Kind Hearts and Coronets.''
</P>
<P>
   It made Guinness an international star. In 1952 he received the
first of his Academy Award nominations, as best actor for ``The
Lavender Hill Mob.'' He was nominated for supporting actor for
``Star Wars'' in 1978
</P>
<P>
   and for ``Little Dorrit'' in 1989. For ``The Horse's Mouth'' in
1958,
</P>
<P>
   he was nominated for best screenplay adaptation, based on the
novel by Joyce Cary.
</P>
<P>
   Guinness lived quietly in the country near London with his wife,
Merula, and their three dogs. His wife and their son, Matthew,
survive.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Guinness was honored by the San Francisco International
Film Festival with a retrospective of his work. He did not like the
trappings of stardom or being fawned upon. He told a Chronicle
interviewer that it was easy for him to avoid attracting attention:
</P>
<P>
   ``I can make myself anonymous when I want to, not by wearing a
disguise but by the way I carry myself.''

 &HT;    Stocks, mutuals excite some sports superstars
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - The image of sports superstars as spoiled kids
squandering money by the ton is not a complete picture, says Money
(September), the personal finance magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every clown blowing a signing bonus on a puce Bentley and
a dozen gold Rolexes, there is at least one eager student of
finance who brings a laptop to practice and talks asset allocation
in the locker room,'' the magazine says in a profile of sports
investors.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA's Shaquille O'Neal favors tech stocks such as Lucent and
AOL; basketball great Michael Jordan is mostly in large-cap mutual
funds at the moment; and NASCAR winner Dale Earnhardt likes _ what
else? _ GM and Goodyear.
</P>
<P>
   Five hefty quarters
</P>
<P>
   Economists predicted that corporate profits would be good to
strong in the second quarter, and they were right, Business Week
(Aug. 14) reports.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings increased 17 percent for the 900 companies the magazine
monitors, making it the fifth straight quarter of double-digit
earnings growth. Not surprisingly, one of the biggest gains came in
the energy sector, where coal, oil and gas companies posted a 187
percent year-over-year gain.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest growth was in the ``new economy'' semiconductors
industry, up 271 percent. The biggest casualty was the ``old
economy'' steel industry, which lost money. Health care, banks and
publishing industries also suffered big declines.
</P>
<P>
   Tax-free and rewarding
</P>
<P>
   Did somebody say ``munis''? Once regarded as the investment
choice of widows and orphans, municipal bonds are winning fans in
the most unlikely of places, Barron's (Aug. 7) reports.
</P>
<P>
   Dot.com millionaires have been buying tax-exempt bonds as a
hedge against the volatility of tech stocks. That's because the
tax-free yield on munis of, say 5.85 percent, is equivalent to a
9.69 percent taxable yield to an investor in the top bracket.
</P>
<P>
   Clicking without film
</P>
<P>
   Digital imaging has been seen by some analysts as the death
knell for old-fashioned photography, and with it companies such as
Kodak, the world's best-known photo company.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, says Forbes (Aug. 21), which notes that Kodak Chief
Executive Dan Carp sees digital images as ``an explosive
opportunity'' for the film company, not the kiss of death.
</P>
<P>
   If he's right, says Forbes, Kodak is an undervalued company. But
if he's wrong, it's lights out in Rochester, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Fast Company (September) devotes 100 of its 400 pages to the
tech magazine's second annual analysis of the ``new economy,''
including the comments of 17 people ``on the cutting edge of the
Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Pro sports is big business in metro Atlanta, with an estimated
$4.5 billion economic impact during the past five years, Georgia
Trend (August) reports. One reason is the breadth of the sports
menu, from baseball to football to basketball to motor sports, and
then some.

   In an interview yesterday at San Francisco's Hyatt Regency

Southern regional chauvinism will be out under his leadership. In

   But the great rates evaporated after two months. Starting with
the third bill, the phone company suddenly started billing her in a

LIEBERMAN SURPRISE GORE VP CHOICE 
 

</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ In a historic move that could give a lift to
his campaign, presidential contender Al Gore Monday selected as his
running mate Sen. Joseph Lieberman, a centrist Democrat and
Orthodox Jew who will be the first of his faith to join a major
party presidential ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign officials compared the breakthrough to John F.
Kennedy's bid to be the first Roman Catholic president four decades
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more significantly, the choice of the two-term senator
from Connecticut underscores Gore's resolve to distance himself
from the scandals of President Clinton, which political experts
have opined may be contributing to Gore's difficulty in closing the
double-digit gap in polls with Republican rival George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, 58, gained national prominence when he stood on the
Senate floor and denounced Clinton's affair with White House intern
Monica Lewinsky as ``inappropriate'' and ``immoral.'' But he voted
against removing Clinton from office after he was impeached.
</P>
<P>
   While the senator could give Gore some moral cover, he could
cause the candidate some headaches with liberal Democrats who may
be unhappy with some of his more conservative stands, such as his
support for private school vouchers. The Bush campaign was quick to
say that Gore's running mate had more in common with the Texas
governor than the Democratic candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But Lieberman and the Gore camp played down differences between
the two men, noting that over the years they have shared similar
values. Both have been active in the Democratic Leadership Council,
a group that has worked to steer the party to the middle of the
ideological spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore and I have pretty much walked the same path. And where
we've had disagreements they have been good faith disagreements,
not disagreements that press our values,'' said Lieberman, who was
in Hartford shortly before noon Monday, when Gore called to offer
the running mate position.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman called the decision a ``a miracle,'' saying that he
assumed that when he went to sleep Sunday night, he had been
crossed off Gore's short list that included three other Senate
colleagues, John Kerry of Massachusetts, John Edwards of North
Carolina and Evan Bayh of Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   But, in fact, after spending Sunday in Tennessee consulting with
a group of close advisers and his wife, Tipper, Gore settled on
Lieberman just after midnight, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, his wife, Hadassah, and two of his four children flew
late Monday afternoon to Nashville, where they were scheduled to
join the Gores for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will officially introduce Lieberman as his
vice-presidential pick today at the War Memorial in downtown
Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the two men will participate in a town hall
meeting in Carthage, where the Gore family owns a farm, before
flying to Lieberman's home state of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore did not publicly confirm his choice, his aides were
eager to discuss the pick they believed would give the campaign a
boost before the Democratic National Convention next week in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane called Lieberman ``a man of
character and a man of integrity.'' He said that the Democratic
ticket will provide a vivid contrast with Bush and his running
mate, Dick Cheney, the former Wyoming congressman and defense
secretary whom Democrats have lambasted as too conservative and too
close to Bush's father.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have a ticket that will represent the new guard vs.
the old guard,'' Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   Lehane said that advisers were not concerned that because
Lieberman is an observant Jew he will not campaign on the Jewish
Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we are going to be very respectful of his
religion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Stamford, Conn., Lieberman is a graduate of Yale
University and its law school. He served as state senator and
Connecticut attorney general before first being elected to the U.S.
Senate in 1988. He was re-elected in 1994, with 67 percent of the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign officials found few faults with Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Al Gore has, in fact, selected Joe Lieberman, he has chosen
a man whom Secretary Cheney and Governor Bush respect,'' said Bush
spokesman Ari Fleischer.
</P>
<P>
   But he said Gore will have difficulty attacking the Texas
governor for his positions on several issues, such as support of
school vouchers and Social Security privatization, which are
similar to Lieberman's stands.
</P>
<P>
   Lehane dismissed the criticism, saying the Bush camp was ``a
little bit flummoxed'' by the choice of Lieberman. He also said
that Gore's positions will prevail on issues where the two men
differ.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, Al Gore is running at the top of the ticket. The
ticket will reflect his agenda,'' Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Democratic Chairwoman Molly Beth Malcolm called Lieberman
``a bold choice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Vice President Gore has demonstrated his strength of character
and independence by choosing someone who does not agree with him on
every issue,'' Malcolm said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lieberman decision got high marks from political analysts,
including conservative Heritage Foundation scholar Marshall
Wittmann, who called the choice ``a brilliant stroke.''
</P>
<P>
   Wittmann &UR; , &LR;  who advised former Republican candidate John McCain,
said the selection allows Gore to counter two negative images that
voters hold about him: that he is too cautious and too close to the
morally flawed Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Wittmann said that Lieberman's ``strong Orthodox faith will
deflect Bush's claim that only he can restore dignity to the White
House.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Ralph Reed, the former head of the Christian Coalition and
Bush adviser, praised Lieberman as a ``strong man who has taken
some courageous stands.'' However, Reed said that unless Gore
changes his positions on some key issues the Democrats will have a
hard time winning the White House.
</P>
<P>
   While Lieberman may create a sensation as the first Jewish
person on the presidential ticket, he may not attract additional
voters since Jews historically have voted for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Florida pollster Jim Kane said that Jews are already among the
most active and reliably Democratic voters in that key swing state.
</P>
<P>
   Kane said some voters may remain reluctant to vote for a Jewish
candidate. Polls showing that more than 90 percent of voters would
be willing to accept a Jew on the presidential ticket may be
deceiving because people will not reveal their prejudices to
outsiders, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because Lieberman works with Republicans regularly and often
takes similar stands on issues, it may be difficult for him to
fulfill the vice-presidential candidate's traditional role of
attack dog.
</P>
<P>
   However, Connecticut political observers noted that Lieberman
ran an aggressive campaign in 1988, when he ousted Republican
incumbent Lowell Weiker.
</P>
<P>
   At the Elliston Place Soda Shop on Monday, around the corner
from the hotel where Gore made his choice, many customers,
including those who were backing Bush, had admiration for
Lieberman, particularly his willingness to scold Clinton for his
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lieberman is a stand-up sort of guy,'' said Steve Ladd, 45,
who added he was amazed that Gore made the choice because he is
``so wishy-washy.'' &QL;

 PUC CHIEF DEMOTES CONSUMER AFFAIRS MANAGERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; BY TODD WALLACK &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHRONICLE STAFF WRITER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2000 San Francisco Chronicle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In her boldest move so far, the newly appointed
head of the California Public Utilities Commission has demoted two
key managers in the division that handles consumer complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Loretta Lynch, who became president in March, said she couldn't
discuss either move because they haven't been announced.
</P>
<P>
   But the former trial lawyer pointed out that last year the state
legislature gave the PUC president broad powers to make staff
changes.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Lynch said she felt the legislature gave the agency head
``a clear directive to become more active in the management of the
commission.''
</P>
<P>
   William Schulte, who has been director of the consumer services
division for 11 years, confirmed yesterday that he has been asked
to step down. Schulte said his last day will be Friday.
</P>
<P>
   One source identified the second demoted official as Larry
McNeely, one of Schulte's key deputies and the head of the consumer
enforcement division, who retired a few weeks ago. (Separately,
Kent Kauss, director of governmental affairs, left last week, but
that move was unrelated, Lynch said.)
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said she is still looking for their replacements.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Carl Wood, a fellow Democrat and key ally of Lynch,
also cited other reasons. He said Lynch didn't think Schulte was
doing enough to protect consumers' rights and was concerned about a
state auditor report that chastised the division for sloppy
accounting managing contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a matter of President Lynch having a senior management
team that she has full confidence in,'' Wood said.
</P>
<P>
   But the move immediately sparked complaints by some consumer
watchdogs, including those who have been critical of the consumer
division but thought Schulte did the best job he could within the
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am kind of shocked,'' said Nettie Hoge, executive director
of The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco. ``I have only seen
him do good work.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers'
Action Network in San Diego, said he was also concerned,
particularly because no replacement has been named.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Schulte was a very experienced internal advocate at the
CPUC,'' Shames said. ``I don't know of any one at the CPUC who can
bring his wealth of knowledge about utility tricks or enforcement
strategies to that position.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Witteman of the Greenlining Institute in San Francisco was
more neutral, saying he thought Schulte was ``a good guy'' but
thought Lynch should be given the latitude to pick managers she
likes.
</P>
<P>
   Schulte, who spent 28 years with the agency, said he wasn't
bitter about the move. ``She has the right to put in who she wants
and who she puts faith in.''
</P>
<P>
   He could still decide to stay on with the commission in a lesser
role or take another job.
</P>
<P>
   What's less clear is how the three Republican commissioners
react. Because Wood and Lynch only control two votes, they often
need help to approve key policies. So far, they have often been on
the losing side of 3-to-2 votes in controversial decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Josiah Neeper said he was unaware of the changes
and couldn't comment. The other commissioners couldn't be reached.

<P>
   PESHAWBESTOWN, Mich. _ The federal government, the state of
Michigan and five American Indian tribes in northern Michigan
signed an agreement Monday aimed at rebuilding fish populations in
the upper Great Lakes and improving strained relations between
whites and Indians in upstate Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   The pact settles 27 years of litigation over whether the state
can restrict Indian fishing, people involved in the negotiations
said.
</P>
<P>
   A vibrant national economy has created a boom in vacation homes
and tourism here in the northern third of Michigan's Lower
Peninsula. The accompanying surge in pleasure boating and
recreational fishing has increased tensions between whites and
Indians, as pleasure boats become dangerously entangled in Indian
nets and charter boat operators blame the Indian fishermen for
depleting trout and salmon populations.
</P>
<P>
   Some Indian nets have been sabotaged, state officials say.
Indian leaders have denied that they are responsible for declining
fish stocks and have angrily denounced what they have described as
efforts to take away some of the few ancestral rights they retain.
</P>
<P>
   The pact calls for the tribes to reduce drastically their use of
large-mesh gill nets, which kill fish of various sizes and species
and can entangle boats. The Indians are to replace gill nets with
trap nets, which allow fishermen to catch fish more discriminately
and are less likely to entangle other boats. The state government
will pay $17 million to buy boats equipped with trap nets and
fishing permits from white-owned companies and give them to Indian
fishermen to replace boats with gill nets.
</P>
<P>
   The trap-net fishing permits are mainly for remote areas of
northwestern Lake Michigan and northern Lake Huron, pulling Indian
fishermen far from Michigan's main recreational boating and fishing
areas.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government will pay an additional $8.3 million to
the five tribal governments. The tribes are expected to use some or
all of the money to compensate small-scale Indian fishing
operations, which will not receive the trap-net boats but will face
restrictions on gill-net fishing for the next 20 years. Use of
large-mesh gill nets by non-Indians has been heavily restricted
since 1968.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has been particularly acrimonious here in this
Indian community and eight miles west in the mainly white town of
Leland. Both towns are on the northwest shore of Michigan's Lower
Peninsula, 220 miles northwest of Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   For whites like John Lindenau, who stood on the dock in Leland
on Monday morning next to his 30-foot charter fishing boat, the
Infinity, the dispute has been about imposing the same rules on
Indians that white fishermen must meet. ``We won the Indian wars
and gave it all away,'' Lindenau said.
</P>
<P>
   But here in Peshawbestown, on the tiny reservation of the Grand
Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, the agreement is the
cause of considerable bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Grand Traverse Band hesitantly, really hesitantly agreed
to sign off on the deal,'' said Ardith Chambers, one of seven
members of the tribal council, as she sat glumly in her office
Monday afternoon. ``All the state wants to do is take apart treaty
rights, and so does the federal government.''
</P>
<P>
   The five tribes ceded the upper third of Michigan's Lower
Peninsula and the eastern half of Michigan's Upper Peninsula to the
federal government in the Treaty of Washington, concluded in 1836.
That treaty allowed the Indians to continue fishing in the region,
but allowed non-Indian fishing, too. The Indians have used the
treaty to oppose efforts by the state to limit Indian fishing,
because the treaty was signed a year before Michigan became a
state.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Traverse Band has only a dozen fishermen left. Most
will lose their livelihoods because they do not catch enough fish
to qualify for trap-net boats from the state, and they will face
new restrictions on the use of gill nets, Chambers said.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Traverse Band agreed to the pact because it was
engaged in a separate dispute with the state over its main
livelihood, the Turtle Creek Casino, a few miles east of Traverse
City. The tribe is so dependent on the casino that it felt
compelled to accept the fishing deal.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the other four northern Michigan tribes, the Grand
Traverse Band is far from the trap-net fishing grounds being
established. The pact was signed Monday night in Brimley.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers along the coastal highway here in northern Michigan find
that Peshawbestown, with its battered trailers and small wood
houses, is a sharp contrast to other communities. The coastline
elsewhere has many million-dollar mansions, often built in the last
few years.
</P>
<P>
   Leland has older houses and has been a fishing center since the
late 1800s; the old wood fishing shanties and smokehouses of its
Fishtown neighborhood are popular with tourists. Leland fishermen
say that the trout population has plunged in recent years, and
blame two large, Indian gill-net boats moored Monday morning at the
Leland dock.
</P>
<P>
   But Indian officials attribute the fish shortage to
environmental factors, like unusually warm lake water in recent
years.

NEW YORK'S MURDER RATE, AFTER UPTURN, STARTS TO SLIDE DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also NY-POLICE-SAFIR) 
 By ELISSA GOOTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York City's murder rate, after a surge that
alarmed the Police Department and brought about an expensive and
aggressive street enforcement campaign, has begun to slide back
down.
</P>
<P>
   The upturn in homicides, which by the end of last year was 6
percent above the count from 1998, had put the department on the
defensive and loomed as a potential political liability for Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, who had made crime reduction his most important
accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   But recent department statistics show that the homicide rate has
flattened, with this year's murder count, which was 413 as of
Monday, an even match with the corresponding period in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers looked even better just last week, with homicides
down 1 percent for the first seven months of this year, compared
with the same period last year, but the rate edged up slightly this
weekend, when the city had one of its most violent nights of the
year: Six people were fatally shot or stabbed throughout the city
late Saturday night into early Sunday. By the end of July, there
had been 392 murders, compared with 396 by the end of July 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of a flat murder rate belies a more marked
decline, given that at the beginning of the year, the police were
still facing a rise in homicides. By the end of March, the city had
13 percent more murders than in the first three months of last
year. That the weekend's onslaught of slayings did not push this
year's homicide count over the total from last year at this time
illustrates that, blips and spurts aside, the situation is
stabilizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crime rate,'' Giuliani said Monday, ``is down all over the
city, even with the violence over the weekend, which occasionally,
unfortunately, you deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sense of relief that we've turned the trend
around,'' said Garry F. McCarthy, the deputy police commissioner of
operations. ``Although it's not the bellwether crime _ the
bellwether crime is robbery _ it's obviously the most important.''
</P>
<P>
   The police credit the drop to Operation Condor, an antinarcotics
program begun in late January. The program has come under intense
criticism for its high cost, for saturating neighborhoods with
narcotics teams and for increasing the number of arrests for petty
offenses. The police say they have since broadened the program to
take aim at crimes against drivers of taxicabs and livery cabs and
to add uniformed street patrols focusing on quality-of-life
offenses like jumping subway turnstiles and peddling without a
license.
</P>
<P>
   So far, at least $41 million has been spent on the program;
police officers working under its banner have made 53,933 arrests
in the course of about 100,000 overtime shifts. In its latest,
broadest incarnation, the police say, Operation Condor is not so
much a new strategy as a redoubling of the department's regular
enforcement efforts in the neighborhoods that need it most.
</P>
<P>
   Critics are reluctant to credit the program for the decline in
homicides, saying the numbers are small, the downward curve is new,
and the murder rate could simply be fluctuating based on forces
that have little to do with law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Police Department has done a lot to reduce crime,
but I'm not sure that they can take all the credit,'' said Karim
Ismaili, an assistant professor of criminal justice at St. John's
University in Queens. ``If the economy goes on a slide and if some
other drug market or underground economy flourishes, we're going to
see an increase.''

IT'S WEST ON LOGO, ISN'T IT?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Nobody symbolizes his sport as literally as does
Jerry West, whose silhouette adorns the red, white and blue NBA
logo.
</P>
<P>
   Or so almost every basketball fan believes.
</P>
<P>
   What you might not know is that the NBA doesn't actually say
it's West on the logo. In fact, the league office seems to get
defensive when the subject is raised.
</P>
<P>
   An NBA publicist said last week that the image of a man
dribbling left-handed on the run is ``an artist's rendering'' not
intended to represent any individual.
</P>
<P>
   Asked for documentation to prove it is or isn't West, the
publicist phoned back minutes later to say he found nothing in the
NBA records that described the logo's origin.
</P>
<P>
   Could he at least look at old NBA publications to see when the
logo first appeared? ``We'll try and see if we can give it a
shot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't called back yet.
</P>
<P>
   The logo apparently debuted in the early 1970s. That was at the
zenith of West's on-the-court legend. It sure !ital!looks like
West. Put it this way: It sure doesn't look like Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar.
</P>
<P>
   But the NBA publicist said the idea that it's West is ``sort of
an urban myth.'' If it's a myth, that's news to the nation's
newspapers, which never hesitate to include the West-as-logo item
in articles about the Lakers' executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the players take the floor (for the NBA Finals), they'll
be wearing the official NBA logo on their uniforms. The player
pictured dribbling the ball with his left hand? Jerry West,'' the
New York Daily News said in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did so well . . . in a Hall of Fame career that the
National Basketball Asociation put his silhouette on its logo,''
The Wall Street Journal said in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The league won't officially recognize that it's him,'' said
Lakers publicity director John Black. ``But we all know it's him.''
</P>
<P>
   If West is retiring, and if the NBA has any thought of honoring
one of its greatest players and executives, a good way might be to
admit he is the sport's original model citizen.

NYPD COMMISSIONER LEAVING FOR CORPORATE JOB, OFFICIALS SAY
</HEADLINE>
 By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Police Commissioner Howard Safir, whose department
won accolades for routing crime and scorn for its unraveling
relationship with many of the black and Latino citizens it served,
is expected to announce Tuesday that he is leaving the job by the
end of this month, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Several officials said Safir, 58, who is being treated for
prostate cancer, will announce that he is taking a job as an
executive with Choice Point, a corporate security firm in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   With the departure of Safir, a loyal, taciturn administrator who
spent four years in the job, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani will have to
select his third and most likely last commissioner to lead the
agency whose work has done the most to form the public perception
of his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Safir, the 39th man to hold the post of
commissioner and the first Jewish one, refused to discuss his
plans. His health was not thought to be an issue in his departure,
several officials said.
</P>
<P>
   As the chief executive overseeing the 40,000-member police
force, Safir shared in the credit for New York City's plummeting
crime rate, which mirrored a national trend.
</P>
<P>
   Although murder rose slightly last year, overall crime remains
lower than it has been in more than three decades, and the safer
streets have been a large factor in New York's resurgence as a
tourist and business capital.
</P>
<P>
   The continuing crime reduction has confounded skeptics who
questioned whether Safir, a quiet and aloof man, would be able to
fill the shoes of his more affable predecessor, William J. Bratton,
an innovator and motivator who was widely seen as one of the
architects of the city's more aggressive approach to public safety.
But Safir ended up even improving the record in reducing crime and
undercut the perception that he was merely a caretaker in the post.
</P>
<P>
   During the latter part of his tenure, however, those gains have
been largely overshadowed by a series of incidents, like the
shooting of Amadou Diallo and stationhouse torture of Abner Louima,
that have raised concerns about whether the police, in their zeal
to cut crime, have trampled the civil rights of citizens,
particularly blacks and Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators have found the city lax in its handling of
brutal officers, and the U.S. Civil Rights Commission concluded in
April that police anticrime units appeared to engage in racial
profiling.
</P>
<P>
   Safir contends that high-profile cases like that of Diallo have
blurred a less-sensational reality: that the number of police
shootings, civilian complaints and brutality lawsuits have fallen.
</P>
<P>
   But some black and Hispanic New Yorkers said that Safir had
often hurt his own cause by adopting a defensive style.
</P>
<P>
   Public Advocate Mark Green, who has called several times for
Safir's resignation, called him a ``failed commissioner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He unnecessarily allowed a racial polarization to grow because
he would not move fast enough or far enough in reforming
recruitment, training and discipline,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he has resolutely defended his officers, Safir has never
been particularly popular with them. The Patrolmen's Benevolent
Association cast a vote of no-confidence in his leadership last
year, and many officers dismissed Safir early on as the mayor's
marionette.
</P>
<P>
   Allies and mayoral aides have said these officers missed how
artfully Safir advocated for his agency, securing additions in
staff and expansions in overtime that have fueled various anticrime
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought he had a very dignified air about him that
the department benefited from,'' said Richard J. Condon, a former
police commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Before being appointed police commissioner in 1996, Safir had
spent two years as fire commissioner. He had also served several
years as a federal drug agent, often working undercover, and in
several posts at the U.S. Marshals Service.

CLEAN BREAK IS BEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jerry West excelled at what coaches so colorlessly call ``making
good decisions.'' He always knew what to do with a basketball.
Later, in his desk job, he always knew what to do with a basketball
roster and salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Now he must decide what to do with himself.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's announcement that the 62-year-old West is stepping down
as the Los Angeles Lakers' executive vice president _ to take at
least a year away from the sport _ leaves him and the franchise in
limbo.
</P>
<P>
   To fans and sentimentalists, this might sound like a good thing,
allowing a glimmer of hope that the architect of four
NBA-championship-winning Lakers teams will eventually return to his
drafting board.
</P>
<P>
   Better, though, would be a clean and permanent break from the
team. Better for West. Better for the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   They have been in limbo, actually, since mid-July. That's when
West left for his Alaska fishing vacation amid reports he told
friends he was retiring. Of course, reports of his retirement have
been greatly exaggerated in several recent summers. So everybody
waited for three weeks for West and the Lakers to make it official,
as they did on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It's a measure of West's importance to the Lakers _ of his
godlike stature in Los Angeles and the basketball world _ that
Lakers owner Jerry Buss allowed him to wring his hands and leave
the franchise hanging for so long.
</P>
<P>
   But look at it another way.
</P>
<P>
   That Buss allowed him so long to make up his mind, to abandon
his office until he's made up his mind, at the precise time of year
when NBA teams are deciding what to do about free agents, is a
measure of the organization's ability to function without him.
</P>
<P>
   If West has been looking for the perfect time to depart, he has
found it.
</P>
<P>
   __ Head coach Phil Jackson is here now to fill the
celebrity-suit role for the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   West succeeded as a player-personnel chief not only because he
could spot talent and knew how to fit a dozen human pieces
together. He succeeded in part because he was Jerry West, Mr.
Clutch, Hall of Famer. The more championships he won as an
executive, the more great players wanted to work for him.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after coaching the Lakers to the NBA title in his first
year with them, Jackson is the star magnet.
</P>
<P>
   __ Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak has served a 13-year
apprenticeship and is ready to take the lead on player personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Kupchak has been wooed by a series of NBA rivals over the years
but remained with the Lakers because he anticipated this
opportunity. It's time he is rewarded _ before his patience runs
out.
</P>
<P>
   __ The decisions that turned the Lakers into champions again
have been made _ and will stay made for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is under contract for six more seasons. Shaquille O'Neal
is signed for three more, Kobe Bryant for five more. With that
trio, the Lakers are head, shoulders and beard above every other
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Staying there is a matter of filling in the lineup around O'Neal
and Bryant. West can leave that to Kupchak and newly appointed
assistant GM Kurt Rambis. Michelangelo painted the ceiling of the
Sistine Chapel; he didn't stick around and grout the bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   __ West, by leaving open the possibility of a return, creates
uncertainty and distraction for a team that proved last season how
helpful it is to have neither.
</P>
<P>
   Kupchak will face enough pressure. Every move he makes will be
measured against WWJD _ What Would Jerry Do? Kupchak shouldn't have
to deal with constant questions about whether he is merely the
!ital!interim boss.
</P>
<P>
   __ West's refusal to attend the NBA Finals is the ultimate sign
his battle with anxiety is lost. He should walk away while he can.
Retirement will be good for West.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement that West is leaving his Lakers office is cause
not to mourn but to celebrate. He leaves the Lakers in great shape.
He can do himself and the franchise another favor by making the
departure permanent.

PALMEIRO SURPASSING FORMER RANGERS STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
CLEVELAND _ There was a time when it was ludicrous to think you
could have traded Rafael Palmeiro for Jose Canseco. Ten years ago,
you probably couldn't have traded three Palmeiros to get one
Canseco.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But times have changed, as yesterday showed. The Tampa Bay Devil
Rays, eager to dump Canseco's salary and tired of his many
injuries, gave him to the New York Yankees for the $20,000 waiver
price, also ridding themselves of the almost $1 million it costs to
pay him the rest of the year. The Yankees are Canseco's sixth team
in seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Once considered the best player in baseball, he has become a
wandering slugger: have bat, will travel. By contrast, Palmeiro,
two months younger, remains an immensely productive player,
entering yesterday's game hitting .275 with 29 home runs and 86
runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the rabbit; I was the turtle,'' Palmeiro said,
observing how he has become more productive than his old friend.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the way it has been with many of Palmeiro's
contemporaries, who were once considered better players. Ruben
Sierra is in the minors, Will Clark is filling in for Mark McGwire
in St. Louis, and Juan Gonzalez is struggling in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly but steadily, Palmeiro is separating himself from those
once more glamorous former Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at it as me being lucky, me being consistent and me
being fortunate,'' Palmeiro said. ``Hard work, too. All those
things come into play. Also having the drive, seeing the light at
the end of the tunnel, where I've been and where I'm going.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro is blunt about what happened with some of his former
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of it, I think, has been carelessness,'' Palmeiro said.
``The main reason is they have been hurt. They've had major
setbacks and can't go out there. But some of it is being content,
not really putting the right amount of time and effort to stay at
the top, not wanting to attain higher goals and achieve more.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not been the case with Palmeiro, who wants to finish his
career with 500 home runs and 3,000 hits, a mark only three other
players have achieved: Hank Aaron, Willie Mays and Eddie Murray. He
has 390 home runs and 2,264 hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I'm still at the top of my game,'' Palmeiro said. ``My
experience is carrying me, but I still think the physical ability
is still here. No way do I think I'm on my way down. I feel I'm as
good as ever on defense and as good as ever on offense. I may have
lost a step of speed, but I was never fast anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Canseco, Palmeiro has also had his physical problems. Last
year, he underwent two knee operations, but instead of letting that
drag him down, Palmeiro went out and had his best year ever. Being
used mostly at designated hitter, Palmeiro hit .324 with 47 home
runs and 148 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Johnny Oates likes to point out Palmeiro played in more
games in the 1990s than Orioles ironman Cal Ripken and said, ``You
don't do that without a little fortitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro said: ``I could have sat out the first two months of
the season \Rlast year\S based on how my knee felt. There were days
I got out of bed, and my knee would give in. But I found a way to
play and help the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing with Cal Ripken also taught me that. I saw him go
through some bad times; there were days when he would practically
crawl into the clubhouse looking like he couldn't play. But not
only would he pick himself up and get into the lineup, he'd find a
way to help the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro is driven. He admitted he would like to finish with big
career numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you told me what I've done so far would be it, I'd be very
disappointed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he would also, more than anything, would like to win a World
Series. In that respect, this season has been hard. He knows the
Rangers are finished, and he wonders what will happen to the team
in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the ultimate deal,'' said Palmeiro, who played in two
American League Championship Series with the Baltimore Orioles.
``I've been so close, and it hurts so bad, especially feeling you
had the best team. I know how it hurts, so I can only imagine how
it feels \Rto win\S. I don't know if I'll get that feeling, but
I've got to make sure I stay at the top my game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look around this clubhouse, guys like Ruben Mateo and Gabe
Kapler, they're going to be good. These guys are going to be the
next stars in three or four years, and I want to be at the top of
my game.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro has three more years on his five-year, $45 million
contract. Despite his knee problems, he has given the Rangers no
reason to worry about receiving full value.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raffy today is the best unknown major-league baseball
player,'' Oates said. ``He quietly stays in the background and puts
up big numbers. He's going to get 500 home runs. Three thousand
hits might be a little tougher, but if he plays five more years, he
could get it. That would be a pretty good career.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be a Hall of Fame career. It doesn't appear as if
Canseco can say the same thing.

RESTORING 1932 WACO AIRCRAFT A 10-YEAR EXCERCISE IN LOVING CARE AND
FRUSTRATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. CRONKLETON  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The dirt path worn in the grass around John
Swander's biplane all but told the story of his adventures at the
recent AirVenture airshow in Oshkosh, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   Admirers, trying to get a good gander at the restored 1932 UEC
Waco Cabin, flocked to the black plane with silver wings.
</P>
<P>
   Swander, of De Soto, Kan., felt pride, and then a little
embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept saying how beautiful a plane it is,'' said Swander,
who restored the Waco. ``But I know better. I know all of the
imperfections and the flaws.''
</P>
<P>
   Swander's reservations aside, the plane is stunning.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see it among other Wacos and antiques of its type, as good
as many of them were, you could see it stand out,'' said Henry
Frautschy, executive director of the Vintage Aircraft Association
and editor of Vintage Airplane Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Swander won the Grand Champion Antique award at the AirVenture
Oshkosh 2000 airshow, sponsored by the Experimental Aircraft
Association. The Waco competed against 100 other antique airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   The annual airshow, held at Wittman Regional Airport in Oshkosh,
is one of the world's largest recreational aviation events. More
than 765,000 people attended this year's event, from July 26 to
Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically what it boils down to is that John has done an
extremely original restoration of the aircraft,'' said Frautschy,
whose association is a division of the Experimental Aircraft
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks just the way it looked as it came off the factory
floor in Troy, Ohio.''
</P>
<P>
   Swander said the Waco Aircraft Co. of Troy built just 45
aircraft of the model he restored. Today, only eight still exist,
and just two, including Swander's, are capable of flying.
</P>
<P>
   Swander's plane was far from its current state when he and his
wife, Jodi, bought it in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   John Swander had just sold a plane _ a 1937 Stinson Reliant SR93
_ and was looking for another to restore.
</P>
<P>
   He ran into his friend, Ron Huckins of Wichita, who mentioned he
had a Waco Cabin for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Swander drove to Wichita, disassembled the plane and took it
back to his workshop in the basement of his house. He started
restoring the plane in the fall of 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft's wing structure is constructed of wood, while the
fuselage is constructed of steel tubes with wood components. Fabric
covers the fuselage and the wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I removed the fabric, I knew I had my work cut out for
me,'' Swander said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally I thought it would take only five years and I would
get it knocked out,'' Swander said. ``I had to take another five
years after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Swander estimated that he had put more than 4,000 hours and
$80,000 into the plane. Had he known it would take so long, he
might not have started.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly have no desire to do it again,'' Swander said.
</P>
<P>
   Swander said more than 60 persons helped him restore the plane.
He has a list that credits them all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody does a project of this enormity all by themselves,''
Swander said.
</P>
<P>
   The one he credits the most is John Krekovich of Overland Park,
Kan., who helped with all of the woodwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw the hint that he wanted my help before he bought the
plane,'' Krekovich said. ``I knew that if he bought the plane, I
would jump right on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Krekovich said the restoration project came just as he was
recovering from a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ``The project became a good rehab,'' Krekovich said.
</P>
<P>
   Jodi Swander said that although the project stretched on, it
didn't bother her too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing how important it was to him made it easy for me,'' she
said. ``When he would get frustrated, I would convince him to put
it aside for a month or two. Sometimes I would provide a shoulder
to cry on.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a perfectionist too,'' she said. ``Somebody else would
have put on something that John rejected.''
</P>
<P>
   A prime example: When applying the fabric to the fuselage, he
decided it didn't look right. He cut it all off and started over,
trashing about a year's worth of work and expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough decision at the time,'' John Swander said.
``But I decided that the first time was good practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, when he got specially made coverings for the wheels,
called wheel pants, Swander just set them next to the plane and
didn't install them.
</P>
<P>
   That puzzled Krekovich, who after three weeks ask Swander why he
didn't put them on.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked at me and said, `I'm afraid to drill the first
hole,' &UR; '' Krekovich said.
</P>
<P>
   But Swander's precision and attention to detail paid off.
</P>
<P>
   As the plane sat on the grass near its hangar at Gardner, Kan.,
Municipal Airport on Saturday, people still gathered for a closer
look.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Dolan of Gardner was among them. He was driving by the
airport when he just had to stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me being an airport bum, I just had to get out and walk around
the plane,'' Dolan said. ``It is not just any day when you get to
see such a gorgeous plane.''

   The announcement that West is leaving his Lakers office is cause
not to mourn but to celebrate. He leaves the Lakers in great shape.
He can do himself and the franchise another favor by making the
departure permanent.

TIME IS RUNNING OUT ON STEELERS' STEWART
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
FORT WORTH, Texas _ Since Kordell Stewart can't throw a football
with any consistency, he should throw in his Terrible Towel.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stewart is a football player. He is not a quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   He is a player for all positions. He is a quarterback/running
back/receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Did you happen to catch him the other night in the Pittsburgh
Steelers' exhibition game against the Miami Dolphins? Of course you
didn't. Then again, neither did his receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart was 0-for-6 with an interception. On one of his
misfires, Stewart had receiver Bobby Shaw wide open in the corner
of the end zone, but he failed to step up in the pocket, and
Dolphins defensive end Jason Taylor hit Stewart's arm.
</P>
<P>
   In Stewart's defense, he had no time. He was chased all 12 times
he dropped back to pass, and the two times he ran for his life, he
gained 29 yards.
</P>
<P>
   That is where Stewart is most dangerous _ outside the pocket.
</P>
<P>
   In his first two seasons, Stewart drove defensive coordinators
crazy. He earned his ``Slash'' nickname by completing 16 of 37
passes for 160 yards and one touchdown, catching 31 passes for 528
yards and four touchdowns and rushing for 257 yards and six
touchdowns on 54 carries. Remember the Monday night game against
Cleveland in 1995 when Stewart's first career pass went for a
2-yard touchdown to Ernie Mills? Or how about the next week against
Cincinnati when he scored on a 71-yard pass from Neil O'Donnell?
Stewart was more exciting than Deion Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Stewart and the Steelers decided he was a quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   In the short run, it proved to be a good move.
</P>
<P>
   With Jerome Bettis running for a career-best 1,665 yards in
1997, Stewart passed for 3,020 yards with 21 touchdowns and 17
interceptions in his first year as a full-time starter, and the
Steelers made it to the AFC Championship Game before losing to the
Denver Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's performance got offensive coordinator Chan Gailey the
Cowboys' head coaching job, and prompted the Steelers to reward
Stewart with a $27 million contract extension that included an $8.1
million signing bonus. Both teams put too much stock in Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   There was the infamous ``Crying Game'' in 1998 in Tampa when
television cameras caught Stewart bawling on the sideline after he
was benched. There was last season when he threw six touchdown
passes, had an AFC-worst 64.9 passer rating and was moved to
receiver for the final five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say I was to a point where I was down and out, but
you know, when you don't have too much success, it kind of causes
you to start searching to try to find some things to happen for
you,'' Stewart said. ``When it doesn't happen, it can cause you to
mope. But I've always been one to work off faith, and with that,
anything's possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I don't ever want to go back out there and play
receiver. That's something that's been done in the past. It's
behind me. My future is to be a quarterback, and hopefully, I'll be
a great one. I'm the player formerly known as Slash. Hopefully we
can move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart had three offensive coordinators in his first three
seasons as a full-time starter. He also had a receiving corps that
couldn't catch a cold. He now has the same coordinator _ Kevin
Gilbride _ for the second consecutive season, and he has big-play
receivers in Troy Edwards and Plaxico Burress. He is out of excuses
and time is running out.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Cowher's job is tied to Stewart's future. Stewart's future
is tied to Bill Cowher's job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time will tell,'' Cowher said, when asked about Stewart's
future as a quarterback. ``That's just something that's going to
take time. There are going to be some tough games he's going to
have come back from, so I think everyone's kind of waiting for him
to have a bad game and see how he reacts to it. But you know what?
He's just got to stay focused and be ready to deal with everything
that comes. I think he's been hardened to a lot of things that have
taken place, and I think consequently, it's going to allow him to
deal with the tough times that are inevitable for every
quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   By next year, Cowher and Stewart both could be somewhere else.
Cowher could have a new zip code, and Stewart could have a new
position.

RANGERS SEND DOWN CORDERO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
CLEVELAND _ The Rangers sent struggling reliever Francisco Cordero
to Triple-A Oklahoma yesterday and called up right-hander Darwin
Cubillan. Cordero had allowed 32 hits and 16 runs in 16 innings in
his past 14 appearances.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``He needs to work on some things,'' Rangers manager Johnny
Oates said. ``One of them is locating the ball better. I can't get
him into enough ballgames here, and you can try some things in the
minor leagues and work on some things. You can't experiment in the
major leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Cordero will likely be back in September, although Oates said he
can't promise anything. Oates said the Rangers are planning an
organizational conference call today to discuss Cordero and Darren
Oliver.
</P>
<P>
   Cubillan was acquired from the Toronto Blue Jays on July 19
along with minor-league infielder Mike Young for pitcher Esteban
Loaiza. Cubillan made six appearances with Oklahoma and did not
allow a run in 13 innings. He allowed 14 runs in 15 2/3 innings in
seven games while with the Blue Jays from May 19 to June 24.
Free-agent broadcasters Besides players, the Rangers have four
other potential free agents: television broadcasters Bill Jones and
Tom Grieve and radio broadcasters Eric Nadel and Vince Cotroneo.
All four of their contracts expire after this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have yet to address that situation, but club
president Jim Lites said he wants to do so this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody needs to be nervous or worried,'' Lites
said yesterday. ``We just need to sit down and evaluate the
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox bought the Rangers' television rights for the next 10 years,
and Lites said the team will have input on the television team. The
Rangers control who does the radio broadcasts, and Lites said
several people will have input, starting with owner Tom Hicks.
Lites, Southwest Sports Group chairman Michael Cramer, club vice
presidents John Blake (public relations), Jeff Cogen (marketing)
and John McMichael (finance) and general manager Doug Melvin also
be involved.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are close to a new agreement with KRLD for the radio
rights, and it's unlikely the Rangers would make a change with
Nadel, who has been with them for 22 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Eric, and I like his style,'' Lites said. ``But he
still has to be evaluated. Everybody does. The job is more than
just broadcasting the game; there's also presenting our product to
the public and selling and representing the advertisers. That
doesn't mean there are any problems, but we still have to look at
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lites said he doesn't want to wait until the end of the season,
saying, ``That wouldn't be fair to anyone.''
Oliver sent to Oklahoma Darren Oliver, on the disabled list with
weakness and fatigue in his left shoulder, has been assigned to
Triple-A Oklahoma on medical-rehabilitation assignment and is
scheduled to Saturday against the Nashville Sounds. The Rangers
want Oliver to make at least four starts for Oklahoma so he can
build up the arm strength and durability that has been missing this
year.
Port Charlotte meeting The Rangers are planning to meet with
officials from Charlotte County this month and will likely work out
a one-year extension to stay at the training facility in Port
Charlotte, Fla. The Rangers aren't ready to commit to a longer
extension until they're sure the county will make the proper
improvements in the facility.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have been looking into Las Vegas, but club vice
president John McMichael said the chances of getting something done
there are diminishing. The Los Angeles Dodgers seem committed to
staying in Vero Beach, Fla., and the Toronto Blue Jays are close to
extending their lease in Dunedin, Fla., for another 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're keeping Las Vegas open as an option, but it's getting
less likely that will happen,'' McMichael said.

GASPING ON THE FIRST DAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE, Calif. _ USC opened what coach Paul Hackett billed as
his toughest training camp Monday, and true freshman defensive end
Nathan Goodson appeared to be the first casualty.
</P>
<P>
   Goodson, one of USC's top recruits, has had one of the most
unpleasant reactions to training camp, vomiting twice after being
run to the point of exhaustion by defensive line coach Ed Orgeron.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came ill-prepared and reality has kicked me in the butt,''
Goodson said good-naturedly. ``I came into camp out of shape. I was
gagging for air. Everything I got I expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodson weighed 265 pounds in high school but ballooned to 285
in the summer and currently weighs 272.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come in and want to play, but they have to be prepared,''
Orgeron said. ``Their idea and my idea of conditioning are probably
two different things. It's a different game up here. He responded.
He wants to be good.''
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Hackett was pleased with the Trojans' conditioning,
saying none of the other players seemed to be straining during wind
sprints.
</P>
<P>
   __ Palmer pleases: Quarterback Carson Palmer appeared extremely
sharp for the first day, showing few of the timing problems with
receivers that Hackett anticipated. The sophomore continues to work
his way back from last year's broken collarbone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he looked great,'' Hackett said. ``This will be his
best day for a while. He's going to get tired now from all the
throwing. But he'll get it back by the middle of next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer said the offense worked better than he expected for the
first day of practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offense is coming together pretty quickly,'' he said. ``I
was kind of surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Late arrivals: Offensive lineman Zach Wilson and linebacker
Anthony Daye missed practice to finish summer school and are
expected today. Hackett said he hoped to know by Thursday if
defensive lineman Sagan Atuatasi would be eligible to join the
team. Atuatasi has been attending junior college.
</P>
<P>
   __ Injury report: Freshman defensive lineman Jamaal Williams
injured his leg in Monday's morning practice and was scheduled for
X-rays Monday night. Wide receiver Steve Stevenson suffered a
pulled hamstring and missed the afternoon practice.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle Ryan Nielsen practiced just once to rest his
shoulder that underwent offseason surgery. Freshman tailback Chris
Howard remains limited from arthroscopic knee surgery and also
practiced once.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Vice President Al Gore picked Sen. Joseph I.
Lieberman of Connecticut to be his running mate Monday, putting a
Jew on a national ticket of a major party for the first time and
choosing the first prominent Democrat to openly chastise President
Clinton for his affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is to formally announce his decision at a rally here at
noon on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman was one of five candidates to be thoroughly vetted by
a corps of lawyers over the last two months and emerged as Gore's
choice early Monday morning, after the vice president huddled for
hours with top aides and family members at a hotel suite here.
</P>
<P>
   Gore aides said Lieberman brought a sense of moral rectitude to
the ticket as well as a seriousness of purpose, qualities that Gore
was intent on seeking after Gov. George W. Bush, his Republican
rival, chose Dick Cheney, the former secretary of defense, as his
running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Christopher, the former secretary of state, who led
Gore's selection process, said in an interview Monday that Bush's
choice had influenced Gore. ``Cheney meant that the vice
president's choice would be measured by a standard of seriousness
reflected by his record,'' Christopher said.
</P>
<P>
   But the comments of the Gore camp, laced with words like
integrity and rectitude, also seemed to reflect their desire to use
Lieberman to move their candidate away from the scandals of the
Clinton administration, which provided one of the themes of last
week's Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at both men, Al Gore and Joe Lieberman, they're
both people who throughout their lives made the right choices,''
said Chris Lehane, Gore's spokesman. ``Both led very responsible
lives and are people who, when faced with tough choices, have time
and time again made the right choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has also been a vigorous advocate of campaign finance
reform, and he recently supported legislation that would ban
unregulated donations to political parties. His record on the issue
could clearly benefit Gore, whose aggressive fund-raising efforts
in 1996 are expected to be the subject of Republican attacks in the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   But in choosing Lieberman, Gore has also picked a running mate
whose record on a number of issues, from school vouchers to capital
gains taxes, are more conservative than the vice president's.
</P>
<P>
   Although reporters were informed of Gore's chose around dawn
Monday morning, Gore did not formally offer the spot to Lieberman
until the afternoon, catching the senator on his cell phone as he
drove into his driveway in New Haven, Conn., after giving a speech
to the Connecticut AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the call,'' Lieberman told reporters waiting at his
house. ``It was directly from Al Gore.'' He said the two had said a
short prayer together.
</P>
<P>
   Gore chose Lieberman over several other senators, including John
Edwards of North Carolina, whose only governmental experience was
two years in the Senate, and John Kerry of Massachusetts, whose
liberal voting record would surely have become an inviting target
for the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Also vetted were Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana and Gov. Jeanne
Shaheen of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, a 58-year-old Orthodox Jew, is known on the national
stage chiefly as the first Democrat to condemn Clinton during the
Lewinsky scandal, when he took to the Senate floor and branded
Clinton's behavior ``immoral.'' Gore, who did not criticize the
president throughout the impeachment process, has had a difficult
time in his campaign distancing himself from Clinton's personal
behavior, in part because he has also sought to associate himself
with the president's positive job performance and the booming
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of Lieberman, Gore advisers said, recognizes that the
Republicans will try to make the president's character a campaign
issue, and they hope the move will shield Gore from such attacks
and undermine Bush's claim that he will restore honor and integrity
to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Gore advisers said the decision, and its timing, a week before
the opening of the Democratic convention in Los Angeles, also was
grounded in Gore's recognition that he needed to do something to
shake up the race. The latest polls show Gore trailing Bush by as
much as 17 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign portrayed the selection of Lieberman as a bold
choice because of its historic nature in naming the first Jew to a
national ticket, but questions were raised early on and again
Monday night about whether Lieberman's religion would work against
him.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Gore aides said they believed that the
decision would demonstrate something the campaign had been trying
to convey for months: that Gore is a ``principled fighter'' who
will stand up for those who have been discriminated against.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher said that the question of Lieberman's religion had
been raised but that Gore ``shut it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Hart, a Democratic pollster, said Gore was aiming his
selection at independent voters and the 15 percent of the
electorate that liked Clinton professionally but not personally.
Hart also said Lieberman, with his ``moral absolutism,'' could
appeal to supporters of Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate for
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore is saying, `I have to find a way of talking to the middle
and getting to the middle,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The centrist message that Lieberman sends was an important
consideration for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Gore began interviewing potential running mates at the end of
July and had completed them by July 25. He interviewed Lieberman in
Washington at the vice president's residence, where four of the
five candidates sneaked passed television cameras. He interviewed
the fifth candidate in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman, who have known each other since serving in
the Senate together, spoke for about an hour in the interview.
</P>
<P>
   One of the overriding factors for Gore was that he pick someone
who could become president on a moment's notice. This became more
imperative, advisers said, after Bush picked Cheney. Although Gore
advisers saw immediate weaknesses in Cheney's voting record, they
also saw that Bush had picked someone whose ability to step into
the Oval Office would not be questioned.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Monday, Christopher said that Gore chose
Lieberman for several reasons. He said the vice president valued
the senator's independence, and the two were personally compatible.
And, Christopher said, Gore regarded Lieberman as ``a symbol of
rectitude.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore could visualize his being a very wise counselor in the
White House,'' Christopher said. ``People in the Senate have a very
high regard for the values he brings to decisions,'' he said,
adding: ``He conveys a very serious purpose.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The final selection process spanned several hours on Sunday.
Gore met at his hotel suite here at 3:30 p.m. Sunday with
Christopher, William Daley, his campaign chairman, and Frank
Hunger, his brother-in-law. They met until 6 p.m., then recessed.
</P>
<P>
   At 9, after dinner, they reconvened, this time with Jim
Hamilton, the senior vetter, and two aides, Tom Nides and Ron
Klain.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's wife, Tipper, and one of their daughters, Sarah, arrived
about 11 p.m., their commercial flight from Washington delayed by
bad weather. The circle then expanded to include other top
advisers, including Donna Brazile, the campaign manager, Tad
Devine, Carter Eskew and Bob Shrum.
</P>
<P>
   Gore made his decision after midnight. Some in the room asked
him if he wanted to sleep on his decision. He said no.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said he awoke to news reports that he had been chosen.
Monica Dixon, a Gore adviser, told Lieberman's staff that the
reports were based on statements by Democratic officials, but
Lehane, the Gore spokesman, said that Dixon had not told them
whether the accounts were true.
</P>
<P>
   When the cameras caught up with him mid-morning, Lieberman said
he was still awaiting the call. But he was confident enough to be
overjoyed, saying, ``Miracles happen.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Henry Blodget's words used to add rocket fuel to the
new economy. On Monday, Merrill Lynch's star Internet analyst
re-entered the atmosphere, downgrading 10 of the 29 companies he
recommends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are resetting the investment ratings for our Internet
universe,'' Blodget wrote in a report. Four months after the start
of the April bloodbath that halted the Internet's unfettered
charge, one of the most reliable of Internet bulls is finally
showing signs of doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Blodget, 34, is considered one of the Internet sector's two
premier analysts, along with Mary Meeker of Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter. Last month, Meeker showed a speck of caution when she
raised her loss-per-share estimates for Amazon.com, but she stopped
short of a downgrade. Blodget has countered with a raft of
downgrades, but on Monday they barely registered across the sector.
</P>
<P>
   TheStreet.com Internet index gained 4.07 percent, and even
several of the names Blodget downgraded surged forward. Why? Maybe
because of how far they have already fallen. The analyst, who once
led the market up, now appears to be following it down.
</P>
<P>
   This has not been a banner year for Blodget, even by the recent
anemic standards of Internet investors. Of the 29 stocks he covers,
11 of the companies are new to the group this year. The other 18
stocks, which he has covered all year, are down an average of 54.2
percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this has been an abysmal year for investing in
Internet stocks. TheStreet.com Internet index is down 33.8 percent.
Since April, Internet mutual funds have had a choke hold on the
bottom of the barrel, entrenched as the worst-performing funds
among all domestic mutual fund categories this year.
</P>
<P>
   Comparing an analyst's picks to a mutual fund has its flaws, but
it can be useful for a rough picture. Blodget's average return
ranks behind even the worst-performing domestic mutual fund, Jacob
Internet, which is down 51.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Only one of his 18 picks, Inktomi, has gained this year. Six
have lost more than 70 percent of their value. EToys has lost 84.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is no longer giving some companies the benefit of
the doubt,'' said Blodget in an interview. ``We're acknowledging
that. The sector is so volatile that it's made some of the ratings
meaningless.''
</P>
<P>
   Figuring heavily into the ``resetting'' of Blodget's downgraded
names were e-commerce stocks. Perhaps the fact that TheStreet.com
E-Commerce index had already fallen 65.5 percent for the year when
the day began meant that there was not much more room for the group
to tumble. Some did fall. Buy.com dropped by 16.1 percent. Others
soared. Doubleclick, the Internet advertising firm, gained 9.8
percent following Blodget's downgrade. IVillage, the beleaguered
portal aimed at women that Blodget downgraded to accumulate from
accumulate/buy, gained 4.8 percent. And Barnesandnoble.com soared
38.4 percent after it struck a deal with Microsoft to create an
online store for digital books.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor could be that Blodget's report was far from a
stark reappraisal of the sector's prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of the reset is not to make a new `call' on the
direction of the group,'' the report said, ``but to provide a more
precise differentiation of our current opinions (by using a wider
range of ratings.)''
</P>
<P>
   A wider range of negative ratings, that is. For those who
actually followed his recommendations, it might come as cold
comfort that Blodget has decided to add a new word to his lexicon
of ratings. Before Monday, his ratings have all been combinations
of one of two words, either ``buy'' or ``accumulate,'' which is
more tepid than a buy recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Now Blodget has added the word ``neutral'' to his repertoire.
Previously, none of the 29 Internet stocks Blodget covered merited
a neutral rating. Neutral, according to Merrill Lynch, means that
it is not clear when a company will be profitable and that
``significant uncertanties or reservations remain.'' In plain
English _ though analysts rarely admit as much _it is roughly
analogous to a ``thumbs down'' from Roger Ebert.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's trying to say, `Look, there are a handful of
companies that are going to be stellar. Those are the Yahoos and
AOLs and maybe Inktomi,'' said James Houlton, manager of the Strong
Internet fund. ``As the market has put the Internet in its place,
it has put him in his place, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with just about everybody else, as Houlton added.
</P>
<P>
   So which companies picked up the dread word neutral? Monday,
eToys, the online toy seller, was downgraded from an accumulate/buy
rating to neutral. Barnesandnoble.com fared slightly better,
downgraded from an accumulate/buy rating to neutral/buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is focused on now is profitability,'' said Blodget. ``I
think we have been very vocal about the stage of the industry's
development. We suggested as far back as last July that this was
going to be a rough time.''
</P>
<P>
   In December 1998, when the Internet was still something of a
novelty item, Blodget predicted that Amazon.com would climb to $400
a share. His prediction made him the butt of jokes in some
quarters, until Amazon hit $400 a few weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Blodget left his job at CIBC/Oppenheimer for a blue
chip post at Merrill Lynch. His picks became a roadmap for some
investors. This year, the road has become less traveled.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an emerging sector like this,'' he said, ``you are going to
make mistakes picking stocks.''

BRITISH AIRWAYS REPORTS 65 PERCENT DROP IN ITS EARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ British Airways reported a 65 percent plunge in
quarterly earnings on Monday, attributing the poor performance to
the effects of the strong British pound and the rising price of jet
fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The results for the March-June quarter were reported as the
airline is trying to break out of a prolonged slump, partly through
a proposed deal to acquire KLM Royal Dutch Airlines N.V. But there
were more signs on Monday that those negotiations, which began in
early June, have not advanced very far.
</P>
<P>
   While both airlines are still in exclusive talks, concerns over
regulatory approval from both the European Union and the United
States have cast doubt over the deal. Executives close to the talks
have said that the two sides are not yet close to an agreement on a
price for KLM. British Airways chief executive, Rod Eddington, said
on Monday it remained unclear whether the talks would result in an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The regulatory obstacles are high for a deal with KLM to receive
approval. British Airways encountered regulatory problems when it
tried to form an alliance with American Airlines. A deal with KLM
was expected to face tougher antitrust scrutiny in Europe because
the combined routes of both airlines would cover a large share of
the market.
</P>
<P>
   The airline said pretax profit before one-time items dropped to
(PS)8 million, or $12 million, from (PS)23 million a year earlier.
Sales rose 4 percent to (PS)2.3 billion. Nonetheless, British
Airways posted a loss of (PS)50 million after the charges were
accounted for, compared with a profit of (PS)200 million a year
earlier. The airline said the rising price of jet fuel and the
strong pound were largely responsible for the financial results.
Fuel is one of the largest expenses for airlines, and a strong
currency translates into fewer profits when overseas earnings are
repatriated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We remain cautiously optimistic,'' Andrew Light, an analyst at
Solomon Smith Barney, wrote in a note to investors about the
airline. But, he said, the uncertainty of the KLM deal remains a
big risk for the stock.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of British Airways dropped 3 pence to 388 pence, or about
$5.82. KLM stock rose 5.9 percent to 30.39 euros, or $27.50.

TWO ENTER NOT-GUILTY PLEAS IN SALT LAKE OLYMPICS BRIBE CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  By JERE LONGMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The two chief organizers of Salt Lake City's bid to be host to
the 2002 Winter Olympics pleaded not guilty on Monday to federal
charges that they had conspired to bribe members of the
International Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants, Tom Welch, former president of the Salt Lake
City bid committee, and Dave Johnson, his chief deputy, said they
were eager to defend themselves in federal district court. A trial
date was set for Oct. 16 in Salt Lake City, but defense lawyers
said they would ask for a delay of up to a year to gather evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Welch and Johnson maintain that they violated no laws in paying
more than $1 million to IOC delegates and their families in the
form of cash payments, scholarships, medical treatment and
expensive gifts. The two have repeatedly said they were simply
conducting business that had become customary for cities bidding on
the Olympics. Their lawyers have indicated that they want a delay
in the trial so they can question IOC delegates to show that it was
common to shower them with exorbitant favors.
</P>
<P>
   The two bid officials have also said they acted with the
knowledge of the Salt Lake City business and political community.
Evidence uncovered in news reports last year clearly indicated that
there was widespread awareness of at least some of their
activities. A trial could prove extremely embarrassing to the
community and its leaders as they prepare to play host to the 2002
Winter Games in 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Welch and Johnson face one count of conspiracy to bribe, five
counts of mail fraud, five counts of wire fraud and four counts of
interstate travel in aid of racketeering. The charges carry a
maximum of 75 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not do anything that violated the law,'' Welch told
reporters outside the federal courthouse in Salt Lake City. ``We
did not do anything that other cities hadn't done. We didn't do
things that should embarrass this community. I think that not only
will we be vindicated and found not guilty, but history will put it
in perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Welch, 55, and Johnson, 41, have said the cash payments were
made to help impoverished athletes in developing nations. However,
evidence has shown that a good deal of the money went directly into
the pockets of IOC delegates. Ten resigned or were forced out of
their positions last year. In an effort to reform the bidding
process, IOC members are now forbidden to visit cities bidding on
the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 of the I.O.C.'s 113 delegates have been implicated in
some form of misconduct regarding bidding on the Games. Revelations
have shown that similar bidding practices occurred in other
successful bid cities, including Atlanta, Sydney, Australia, and
Nagano, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the thorniest charge facing Welch and Johnson concerns
$130,000 from a New York travel agency, Jet Set Sports, that
prosecutors say the two men diverted for personal use. Lawyers for
Welch and Johnson said the money was used for bidding purposes. Jet
Set Sports later became an official travel agent for the 2002
Winter Games.  &QL;

McMICHAEL FOLLOWS HEART, NOT RANGERS 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
ARLINGTON, Texas _ Chuck McMichael always looks like a man with his
passport in his back pocket.
<TEXT>
<P>
   He always looks like he is ready to ``go.''
</P>
<P>
   Not next week.
</P>
<P>
   Not tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Right now.
</P>
<P>
   He looks like a man who is about to catch a plane.
</P>
<P>
   To Puerto Rico. To the Dominican Republic. To Venezuela. To
Taiwan. Someplace, anyplace, with an exotic name and a baseball
diamond carved out of the jungle.
</P>
<P>
   With his dark tan and his casual, easy use of Spanish, he is as
at home talking about baseball in La Romana, or Maracaibo, or Nuevo
Laredo, as he is in his own backyard in Grapevine.
</P>
<P>
   He is exactly what he looks like _ a baseball scout.
</P>
<P>
   Until last week, he plied that trade for the Texas Rangers. Not
anymore, and that's what this story is about.
</P>
<P>
   Through no real fault of their own, the Rangers have lost a good
baseball man, and that's never a good thing. McMichael resigned
after four years as the Rangers' director of domestic and
international scouting.
</P>
<P>
   You could call it a case of burnout, but that wouldn't be quite
right. You could say it was a difference of philosophies between
McMichael and general manager Doug Melvin, but that wouldn't be
accurate either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just gets down to one guy's decision to be true to himself,
to say, `You know, follow your heart a little bit here,' ''
McMichael said yesterday. ``Baseball people tend to migrate toward
their heart, and my heart is in scouting. I was getting farther and
farther away from doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, McMichael found his administrative duties as the
Rangers' scouting director were keeping him away from his first
love, and that was in the field, not in the office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dirt and the grass and the sunshine and the smell of the
park are definitely in my blood,'' he said. ``I love Latin America.
I love spending time with newer scouts. I learn from them like they
learn from me.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a particular thrill to walking into a country when you
know no one in your organization has ever been there and then begin
pulling players out of there, whether it's Korea or Taiwan or
Nicaragua or Honduras or wherever.''
</P>
<P>
   The career blueprint the 42-year-old McMichael once thought he
would follow would have had him well on his way to becoming a
major-league general manager by 45. At one time, that seemed
important.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, maybe 55 would be OK,'' he said. ``Maybe I'll get back to
it then.''
</P>
<P>
   He's simply not ready to give up the grassroots part of the
game, and that's what his job with the Rangers was basically
forcing him to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an adjustment to be a scouting director,'' conceded
Melvin, who has been one himself. ``It's a demanding job and a
transition to go from the field to the office. We all get faced
with that sometime.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had an opportunity to work in here and do that. Part of
it is not only evaluating talent; it's directing and supervising
and managing people _ putting staffs together. There's a lot more
to it than just going out and seeing ballplayers. People just have
to decide what they want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past four years, McMichael has supervised the move of the
Rangers' baseball academy in the Dominican Republic from San
Cristobal to La Romana; opened a new academy in Venezuela;
increased the franchise's presence in Panama; and worked to
establish ties with teams in Mexico. At the same time, he has
overseen the club's scouting, drafting and signing of amateur free
agents in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``You create this monster,'' McMichael said, ``and then you have
to have a zoo keeper to feed the monster.''
</P>
<P>
   The 35 to 55 voice messages each day, the 30 e-mails each day,
the three to five hours on the cellphone every day, the constant
interruptions at home _ those are all normal days for a scouting
director.
</P>
<P>
   ``To feed the monster requires a huge amount of time and
sacrifices that in the end, you think you're best at,'' McMichael
said, ``and that's evaluation and creativity.''
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, McMichael would make a terrific special-assignments
scout. Send him to New York, or Chicago or Toronto to evaluate the
players in a possible trade. Have him cross-check the abilities of
a hard-throwing high school pitcher in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Send him
to the Dominican Republic or Venezuela to give a second opinion on
the talent there. That's what McMichael is good at.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rangers already have a fine special-assignments scout in
Rudy Terrasas. They have an experienced, veteran major-league scout
in former Astros general manager Bill Wood. Melvin thought about,
but ultimately rejected, creating a position to try and keep
McMichael, because he couldn't make it financially feasible for
either the organization or McMichael.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you lose someone who can evaluate talent, it hurts,
but it will give somebody else in the organization an opportunity
to grow,'' said Melvin, who has already talked to all three
cross-checkers (Jeff Taylor, Dave Klipstein and Tim Hallgren)
within the system to get a feel for their level of interest in
becoming the team's next scouting director.
</P>
<P>
   McMichael, meanwhile, has already had calls from Cleveland,
Colorado, Atlanta and Kansas City, among others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm flattered by the number of people who have called, almost
embarrassed,'' McMichael said. ``I'll find something that's the
right fit, something that will involve some major-league scouting
with international scouting mixed in.''
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 42, McMichael has taken the unusual and courageous
step of throwing out the career blueprint to follow his heart.
</P>
<P>
   He's got places to go, people to see.
</P>
<P>
   Have passport, will travel.

RANGERS WASTE HELLING'S EFFORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
CLEVELAND _ Gabe Kapler's hitting streak reached 21 consecutive
games last night, but Rick Helling's six-game winning streak is no
more.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Helling didn't deserve for his streak to end, but he was
pitching on a night when Kapler's streak and Rusty Greer's 1,000th
career hit were about the only good things to happen to the Rangers
offensively.
</P>
<P>
   And Helling ran into an unusual opponent, as five Indians
pitchers, including starter Steve Woodard, held the Rangers
scoreless on five hits for a 2-0 victory at Jacobs Field.
</P>
<P>
   Helling held the Indians to four hits through seven innings but
got his first loss since June 23 because of one controversial play
at the plate in the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He pitched awesome,'' said catcher Bill Haselman, shaking his
head.
</P>
<P>
   Haselman wasn't happy the Rangers lost when Helling pitched so
well. He was also fuming about the play at the plate in the seventh
inning that gave the Indians their first run.
</P>
<P>
   After retiring 12 consecutive batters, Helling walked Jim Thome
to start the seventh. After David Segui flied out, Wil Cordero
singled to right on a hit-and-run, moving Thome to third.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Fryman followed with a medium fly to right fielder Chad
Curtis and Thome tagged up. Curtis' throw beat Thome and Haselman
seemed to get the tag on Thome, who tried to slide around it. But
umpire Brian Runge ruled Thome got his hand on the plate before the
tag, a dubious point Haselman and manager Johnny Oates argued long
and loud.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question in my mind he was out,'' Haselman said. ``I
wouldn't have argued if I didn't think so. All I know is I tagged
him hard, but he \RRunge\S said he stuck his hand in there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians added a run in the eighth against reliever Mike
Venafro on three consecutive two-out singles by Omar Vizquel,
Roberto Alomar and Thome. That was more than enough against the
Rangers, who wasted Helling's performance by getting shut out for
the third time this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great pitching performance by Rick,'' Greer said. ``I
don't think anybody in the clubhouse expects Rick or anybody on the
pitching staff to do that every night. It's up to the offense to
help him out, and we didn't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' best chance came in the fifth when Rafael Palmeiro
and Kapler led off with singles. Ricky Ledee was supposed to bunt,
but missed the sign. Instead he hit a high drive to deep left and
Cordero got back to the wall to make a great leaping catch, taking
away an extra-base hit.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward then struck out Haselman, walked Mike Lamb and struck
out Royce Clayton to end the inning. The Rangers also loaded the
bases with two out in the sixth, but reliever Tom Martin got
Curtis, pinch hitting for Ledee, to ground out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I pitched well,'' Helling said. ``Their pitchers
made the big pitches when they had to. I have all the faith in the
world in our offense. It was just a night when we didn't score any
runs.'' nn

A Q&AMP;A WITH COWBOYS CORNERBACK RYAN McNEIL 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
Deion. Deion. Deion.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ryan McNeil has heard that name enough to last two lifetimes.
</P>
<P>
   The man, however, whom the Cowboys signed to replace their
former all-everything cornerback, knows the constant comparisons
have just begun. The regular season and two much-anticipated
meetings with Deion Sanders and the Redskins are still weeks away.
</P>
<P>
   In a conversation with Star-Telegram staff writer Clarence E.
Hill Jr., McNeil, who sports a brash, cool flavor compared with
Sanders' flashy and bold flair, said he just wants to be accepted
for being himself.
</P>
<P>
   Besides he says he didn't come here to replace Deion. He came
here to win a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ST: Are you comfortable here yet? I'm sure knowing head coach
Dave Campo and some of the other coaches from your days at Miami
helped.
</P>
<P>
   RM: ``It's been a smooth transition. One of my biggest assets
has been adaptability. This is my fourth team in seven years. I
have the ability to mesh well, mesh quickly. But here it was a lot
less effort doing so than previous teams.''
</P>
<P>
   ST: You've played with one-year deals the past four years, yet
you signed with the Cowboys for five years. You also could have
gotten more on a one-year deal in Cleveland. Are you looking for
stability?
</P>
<P>
   RM: ``This is the longest I've signed in my whole career. That
says a lot. I plan on being here five years or longer. Cleveland
was a great one-year deal situation. But there's going to be some
time before they have a lot of success. I've been a winner all my
life and the last four years in Detroit \R1996\S, St. Louis \R1997
and 1998\S and Cleveland \R1999\S have been miserable team-wise.
The Cowboys have been there and done that. Management is hungry for
another Super Bowl. The players are hungry for another Super Bowl.
I'm starving for a Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   ST: Does it bother you that you weren't the Cowboys first
choice? They turned to you after they got shunned by little-known
Deron Jenkins, who chose San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   RM: ``It doesn't bother me who played here before me or after me
or who else they wanted. That doesn't concern me. I know what I can
do. I've always been able to narrow my focus so much that it's like
a rifle shot as opposed to a gun shot. I know what I'm here to do,
and I'm going to do it well.''
</P>
<P>
   ST: OK, let's cut to the chase. Can you replace Deion?
</P>
<P>
   RM: ``I don't look at it as replacing Deion. What he brought to
the table as far as talent, nobody can replace him, not one person.
He is that special. He was a wide receiver, a kick returner and a
cornerback. My corner of the pie is the cornerback position. I've
done that most of my life. I've played cornerback. So I'm not
concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   ST: Do the constant Deion questions frustrate you, and how are
you dealing with them?
</P>
<P>
   RM: No, I knew the deal coming in. It takes a special person to
sign under those circumstances. But I had a long talk with Mr.
\RJerry\S Jones, coach \RDave\S Campo and coach \RMike\S Zimmer. I
understand where they are coming from. And I wanted it crystal
clear where I was coming from. I just told them what you see is
what you get. I'm not trying to be anything I'm not. I'm not trying
replace anybody. I'm a businessman. That's the way I approach the
game. I try to have fun. But for the most part I am serious. That's
the way I am. I want people to accept me for who I am. And for me,
the simplest approach is the easiest approach. Once training camp
starts, everything outside of football is extra. I cut that out as
much as possible. To me, the Deion stuff is extra. That has no
bearing on how I play. The game of football is 100 yards. You get
six points for a touchdown, and my job is to stop the opposing
receiver from catching the ball. It's been that way since peewee.
The rules haven't changed. I'm able to deal with that and thrive on
that.''
</P>
<P>
   ST: You were criticized in minicamp for being rusty. Now the
coaches are seemingly comfortable with what you can do. What was
the deal?
</P>
<P>
   RM: ``One thing I like about the coaches is that they were
patient with me. Yes, I was rusty. My technique wasn't up to par.
But I'm critical on myself. I will put more pressure on me than any
coach, media or owner. I've worked out the kinks, and I'm playing
pretty well. I'm not where I want. I will get better. But they have
some sense of security in me now.''
</P>
<P>
   ST: But is it funny that your early struggles caused such a
ruckus?
</P>
<P>
   RM: ``It all tickles me. Why bring me here if you didn't think I
could play? But I could feel everybody holding their breath. As a
veteran, you can sense it, people holding their breath, crossing
their fingers, hoping I can play. But it's cool. It just goes back
to me dealing with me. I just need to focus and keep things in
perspective the way I've been doing. I'll be fine. The key thing is
that I control it. I control how I play and what I do. That's all
that's important.''
</P>
<P>
   ST: Do you understand why your success is so important? With so
much uncertainty at cornerback, the Cowboys need to know they can
count on you, and the scrutiny is going to continue.
</P>
<P>
   RM: ``I'm not worried about that. I've always been able to count
on myself. I've always bet on myself. That's why I have all these
one-year deals. I've sacrificed some money because of it. That's no
big deal to me. I just want to be in a place that I'm respected,
welcomed, and loved. That's why I came to Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   ST: You are from Florida like Deion. You went to the University
of Miami like Michael Irvin. Yet, you don't wear flashy clothes,
and you don't talk trash. Aren't those rites of passage down there?
</P>
<P>
   RM: ``I'm down to earth, conservative. That's always one of the
biggest surprises when I tell people where I'm from and where I
went to school. But I'm not like that. I'm a businessman. That's
how I carry myself.'' nn

COWBOYS SIGN TIGHT END, CORNERBACK

WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ The Cowboys filled needs at two
injury-plagued positions yesterday by signing tight end Rickey
Brady and cornerback Hurley Tarver, free agents who were NFL Europe
teammates with the Scottish Claymores this summer.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brady, who turns 30 in November, is a 6-foot-4, 246-pound tight
end who had a training-camp tryout with the Cowboys in 1996. He
will try to replace Mike Lucky (major knee surgery/out for the
season) as David LaFleur's backup at blocking tight end.
</P>
<P>
   Tarver, 24, was a track and football star at Western Hills High
School, where he was all-district in the triple jump. The 6-foot,
186-pounder is needed because of the day-to-day injury situations
with cornerbacks Dwayne Goodrich (strained left hamstring) and
Duane Hawthorne (sprained left shoulder). Both were hurt in
Saturday's 20-9 loss to Atlanta in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Tarver, who played at Central Oklahoma University, was cut each
of the past two preseasons, at San Francisco and Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Brady was drafted in 1994 in the sixth round by the then-Los
Angeles Rams but has spent his career bouncing around the league _
mostly on practice squads _ with the Rams, Saints, Eagles, Jets,
Cowboys, Redskins, Saints again, Buccaneers, Titans, Dolphins and
Cowboys for a second time.
Briefly Defensive ends Peppi Zellner (dislocated finger) and Aaron
Fields (head contusion) are expected to practice today. X-rays on
Zellner's left hand were negative. The Cowboys, with the
maximum-allowed 88 players, no longer are keeping a spot open for
Pro Bowl offensive tackle Erik Williams, a three-week holdout who
who has indicated through his agent that he might retire. If
Williams reports, the Cowboys likely would get a one-week roster
exemption from the league office. nn
