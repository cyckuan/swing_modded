<HEADLINE> Santer Regards EU Executive Resignation as Political Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 16 (Xinhua) -- President Jacques Santer of the
European Commission said on Tuesday the commission's resignation
last night was a political act even though its members judge the
accusation from an independent report to be unbalanced.
</P>
<P>
The president, in a statement released here following the mass
resignation of all members of the executive body of the European
Union (EU), promised that "we would act on the report by the
committee of Independent Experts."
</P>
<P>
However, Santer alleged that the report's focus is on a small
number of specific cases which have recently attracted criticism
from the European Parliament.
</P>
<P>
"The cases are analyzed in great detail and, while the
findings reveal certain malfunctions and one instance of
favoritism, I would point out that there is no suggestion that any
member of the commission was involved in fraud or corruption or
stood to gain personally," said Santer.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the probe team only cited "a tiny number of cases
of fraud and malfunctioning", the President said the committee's
report paints a picture of total absence of responsibility on the
part of the EU executive branch and its officials.
</P>
<P>
"This picture is distorted. I consider the tone of the report's
conclusions to be wholly unjustified," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president also defended himself and all the president's men,
saying, "I do not accept that four years of work can be reduced to
six cases of irregularities, four of which date back to before
1995."
</P>
<P>
"I would also have hoped that the Committee of Independent
Experts might have attached appropriate significance to the very
substantial reforms carried out by this commission since 1995 and
the ambitious program announced to parliament last January," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Committee of Independent Experts, set up on February 2,
said in its report that it found "instances where commissioners or
the commission as a whole bear responsibility" for the fraud,
irregularities or mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
Santer concluded that the commission as a caretaker executive
will continue to perform its functions until member states appoint
a new team under the Treaty of European Union.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Pledges to Promote Women's Sport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's first national
conference on women and sport closed Tuesday after endorsing a
draft resolution calling for women's more involvement in sports.
</P>
<P>
The Women and Sport Conference 1999, themed "Women and Sport:
New Horizons", is aimed at "increasing the participation of women
and girls in sport in Singapore at all levels and in all functions
and roles, said the resolution.
</P>
<P>
"Having this conference taken place is a great achievement,"
said Kwan Yue Yeong, executive director of Singapore Sports
Council (SSC), in his closing address.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day session, SSC officials, staff of local
schools, visiting foreign scholars and students shared their
opinions of the barriers, myths and mindsets which keep women away
from sports and also discussed solutions to some of the
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Only 28 percent of women participated regularly in sports in
1997, compared with 40 percent of males, according to the result
of an SSC survey.
</P>
<P>
People at the conference agreed that family commitments, career
and even some biased social values constitute part of the
obstacles to women's participation in sports.
</P>
<P>
It is hard to follow the values of Germany, Canada and
Australia, said Kwan. "We will look for solutions that reflect
(the values) of the Chinese, the Malays and the Indians (in
Singapore)".
</P>
<P>
Some practices of Asian society can not be changed without
taking Singaporeans' interests into account, said Kwan. "We just
can't change it, no matter how fast we want to change it, no
matter how much money and resources we pour into it."
</P>
<P>
The resolution said that the principles of the Brighton
Declaration, approved at the first international conference on
women and sport in Brighton, Britain, in May 1994, should guide
actions intended to increase participation and suggest an action
plan to carry out the principles.
</P>
<P>
"We want to try to go away from here with thousands of plans
under action, let's try to get all these barriers, imbalances
corrected, and move ahead and do it in a Singaporean way that we
think is practical," said Annabel Ess, who chaired the conference
and is also an SSC member.
</P>
<P>
The situation of women's involvement in sport in Singapore "is
on the verge of becoming good", said Sue Neill, co-chair of the
International Working Group on Women and Sport and also a keynote
speaker at the conference.
</P>
<P>
Sue said that Singapore will gain much momentum to improve
women's participation in sports after the conference.
</P>
<P>
The Brighton Declaration principles include women's equity in
sport, the accessibility of facilities, school and junior sport,
leadership in sport, education, domestic and international
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The declaration's aim is to develop sports culture in a way
that enables and values the full involvement of women in every
aspect of sport.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Start Trial of AIDS Vaccine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will start a large-scale
trial of a preventive vaccine to protect against the predominant
strain of HIV/AIDS virus found in the country, the Thai News
Agency (TNA) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The trial, to be started on March 24, involves 2,500 volunteers
and is expected to provide answers to key scientific questions
within three years, TNA said.
</P>
<P>
The news agency said the volunteers would be those who were
recovered intravenous drug users from rehabilitation centers.
</P>
<P>
The trial vaccine, developed by a U.S. firm by synthetically
combining a protein, called GP120, from the outermost cover of
AIDS virus B and E strains, is one of the three "vaccine
concepts", which are being extensively explored in various
countries.
</P>
<P>
The E strain was taken from the North of Thailand to make the
vaccine in combination with the B strain which was found among
intravenous drug users in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday, Jose Esparza, chief of the HIV vaccine team
of the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS, said here at an
international conference on HIV vaccine development that the
large-scale trial of the GP120 HIV vaccine in Thailand, the
world's second, and the trial in Uganda of phase I of the
so-called prime-boost vaccine will have significant meaning for
global efforts to develop an HIV vaccine in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
In addition to GP120, two more vaccines, the prime-boost
vaccine and the naked DNA vaccine made of the virus's DNA, will
undergo much larger-scale trials.
</P>
<P>
However, Esparza warned researchers to be prepared for failures
if the vaccines do not prove to be protective.

<HEADLINE> German Government Approves Nationality Law Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN March 16 (Xinhua)--The coalition cabinet of Germany under
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on Tuesday approved a bill to reform
the country's 86-year-old bloodlines citizenship law.
</P>
<P>
The bill will be sent to Bundestag, lower chamber of Germany's
parliament, for approval on Friday, and is expected to become law
on January 1, 2000, German Interior Minister Otto Schilly said.
</P>
<P>
Under the reform, foreign children born in Germany will
automaticly get German citizenship, and will be allowed to remain
dual-nationals until aged 23 when they will have to choose a
single nationality.
</P>
<P>
Current citizenship law of Germany, which has been effective
since year 1913, mandates that children born to foreigners in
Germany remain foreigners unless they go through a complex
naturalization process and give up their foreign passport.
</P>
<P>
The reform will allow adult foreigners in Germany to apply for
citizenship after eight years instead of the current 15-year
waiting period. Applicants will be judged on allegiance to the
German constitution, ability to speak German and a clean criminal
record.
</P>
<P>
Dual-nationality will be barred except for foreigners who have
lived longer than 30 years in Germany or are aged over 60.
</P>
<P>
Schilly ruled out the possibility of a more sweeping reform in
current legislature period, which will end in year 2002.
</P>
<P>
The reform was approved by the Greens Party, Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder's junior coalition partner.
</P>
<P>
The Greens had originally backed a far more radical reform,
which planned to offer dual-nationality to all of the 7.4 million
foreigners living in Germany.
</P>
<P>
The current version of the bill came after Schroeder's
coalition lost the local election February in Hesse state, where
anger among Germans over the planned reform helped cause the
defeat of Schroeder's Social Democrats (SPD).
</P>
<P>
Changing the citizenship law requires approval of parliament's
upper chamber, the Bundesrat, which represents 16 federal states
of Germany.
</P>
<P>
SPD, losing control of the Bundesrat due to the defeat in
Hesse, was then forced to get compromise with the tiny Free
Democratic Party (FDP) in order to collect enough upper house
votes.
</P>
<P>
FDP governs in a coalition with SPD in Rhineland-Palatinate
state.

LONDON, March 16 (Xinhua) - British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said on Tuesday that European Commission President Jacques Santer
should step down as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"The president of the Commission should leave as soon as
reasonably and practically possible and a new president should
take his place," Blair told parliament in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Blair said Santer was responsible for the resignation of the
Commission after an independent report accused it of corruption
and mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
"But I will be blunt. We cannot have the next president decided
in the same way as the last, debating the narrow interests of one
country or another.
</P>
<P>
"The top jobs, not just in the Commission, but throughout the
European institutions, should go to the top people. Merit and
merit alone should decide," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
Blair said next week's EU summit in Berlin should hammer out a
contract of reform for the Commission, including a complete
overhaul of financial control, a new system for monitoring
financial management and spending programs and new procedures
for awarding EU contracts.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll in U.S. Train Derailment Rises to 12 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- At least 12 people were killed
and over 100 others injured as a train slammed into a truck loaded
with steel bars at a crossing in Illinois State of the United
States Monday night, said reports reaching here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The train's engines and passenger cars were scattered over the
tracks, with smoke pouring from the wreckage two hours after the
crash.
</P>
<P>
The train was bound for New Orleans from Chicago. A dispatcher
with the Bourbonnais Police Department said the collision happened
around 9:40 p.m. (local time) at a crossing 90 kilometers south of
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
The train consisted of two engines and 14 passengers cars, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
"We've removed 12 bodies," Captain Ed St. Louis of the
Bourbonnais Fire Protection District said Tuesday morning. "We
believe there to be six to eight more people."
</P>
<P>
Rescuers were focusing their search in one of the sleeper cars,
said St. Louis, adding that officials were still trying to
determine if there were 214 people on the train or 216. Eighteen
crew members were on board.
</P>
<P>
He said 196 survivors from the train had been taken to
hospitals or a local school for treatment by the Red Cross. More
than 100 were taken to hospitals and at least 11 were in critical
condition.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said 101 people were taken to hospitals in nearby
Kankakee. One was airlifted to Loyola Medical Center in suburban
Chicago. Of the injured, 11 were listed in critical condition and
at least 19 in serious condition.
</P>
<P>
They said they were investigating whether gates and lights --
which were flashing after the accident -- were working before the
collision.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Beduins Crossing to Israel to be Deported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Israel and Egypt will soon
solve the problem over the deportation of Egyptian Bedouins from
southern Israeli border areas, said officials of a visiting
Egyptian delegation on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Some 600 Sinai Bedouins crossed the Israeli-Egyptian border on
Sunday evening and an additional 200 came over on early Tuesday
morning to Israel to escape a tribal feud, said the Israeli Army.
</P>
<P>
The tribesmen, bundled up with sacks and blankets, were stopped
by Israeli soldiers after they breached the border region of Har
Harif near Mitzpe Ramon in southern Israel.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli army source said the tribesmen received humanitarian aid
from Israeli soldiers at makeshift encampments while waiting for a
possible evacuation order,
</P>
<P>
The tribesmen, claiming they crossed the border in an effort to
escape a feud with another clan, are seeking for asylum, said the
army source.
</P>
<P>
Israeli government officials said the issue can only be solved
with the cooperation of the Egyptian government.
</P>
<P>
Israel, as a sovereign country, will not allow people to simply
migrate in, Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani told the
Israel Army Radio on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Israel will not allow more Sinai Beduins in and the issue can
be resolved by the Egyptian authorities and Sinai Beduins
themselves, said Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The issue will not affect Israel's relationship with Egypt,
said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian ambassador to Israel Mohammed Bassiouni confirmed here
Tuesday that the Sinai Beduins came to Israel due to tribal feud,
not for political reasons.

PARIS, March 16 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
Tuesday described the group resignation of the European Commission
as a "grave action", but said that it answers the situation.
</P>
<P>
 "The chiefs of state and government (of EU countries) should
now coordinate themselves, especially at the summit to be held in
Berlin on March 24 and 25, so that the continuity of the
functioning of the European institutions, notably the Commission,
be assured,'' he said when answering questions at the National
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Jospin also expressed his hope that the crisis should not
undermine the negotiations among EU countries concerning the
Agenda 2000 fiscal program on the spending of EU from 2000 til
2006.
</P>
<P>
"This crisis should at least be a point of departure to go
toward more transparency and democracy in the functioning of
Europe," he said.
</P>
<P>
The 20 members of European Commission resigned early Tuesday
morning after being accused of being plagued by favoritism and
mismanagement by a committee of five wise men investigating the
accusations on fraud against the commission members.
</P>

Former French Socialist Prime Minister Edith Cresson was

<HEADLINE> U.S. Industrial Production Shows Unexpected Strength </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The Federal Reserve reported
Tuesday that output at factories, mines and utilities rose by 0.2
percent in February, led by a jump in the production of appliances
and home electronics gear.
</P>
<P>
The Fed said the increase was better than had been expected.
Many analysts had been looking for output to be unchanged in
February just as it had been in January.
</P>
<P>
The 0.2 percent rise in industrial production was the biggest
advance since a similar 0.2 percent rise in December with strength
at factories and mines offsetting lower production at the nation's
utilities.
</P>
<P>
According to Fed's report, factory output rose by 0.2 percent,
the fifth straight monthly increase for a sector that has been
hard-hit by the Asian financial crisis, which has cut into
overseas export sales and led to increased competition from
foreign imports. For February, output of consumer durable goods
rose 0.9 percent, led by large increases in the production of
appliances and home electronics. But auto production dipped a
slight 0.1 percent after a strong January increase.
</P>
<P>
Output in the mining industry was up 0.4 percent as gains in
coal mining offset weakness in oil and gas drilling. Output at the
nation's utilities was down 0.6 percent, reflecting a
warmer-than-usual February.
</P>
<P>
The nation's factories operated at 80.3 percent of capacity in
February, down slightly from January. The operating rate is the
lowest it has been since August 1992. The absence of production
bottlenecks is one reason inflation has remained well behaved.

LONDON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's chief of police
Sir Ronnie Flanagan ordered on Tuesday an unprecedented
international investigation into the car bomb murder of solicitor
Rosemary Nelson.
</P>
<P>
Flanagan, head of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, appointed Kent
Chief Constable David Phillips, 54, to head the inquiry and an
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent from the U.S. is also
flying in on Wednesday to join the probe.

Nelson, a prominent human rights lawyer in the province, died
on Monday after a bomb destroyed her car in Lurgan, Co Armagh, 50
km southwest of Belfast. A Protestant paramilitary group, the Red
Hand Defenders, later claimed the responsibility for the bombing.
</P>
<P>
Flanagan told BBC Radio Ulster he hoped the FBI's reputation
would provide "an international dimension as well as added
independence".
</P>
<P>
He voiced concern over the improved capability of the bombers,
the dissident loyalist Red Hand Defenders, saying the group had

meeting because of its human rights record.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid was quoted as saying "(They) cannot ignore any ASEAN
country and if they (EU) don't want to give any facilities to any
ASEAN country to attend the meeting, we will definitely not attend
the meeting. This is our common stand and in that case there will
not be any meeting of foreign ministers between ASEAN and EU."
</P>
<P>
He said the issue was about a meeting between organizations and
not about the human rights practice of an ASEAN member.
</P>
<P>
He said the EU's reluctance to pursue with the meeting would
not help efforts at cooperation between the two organizations.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) involving
ASEAN, Japan, South Korea and China which is scheduled for March
28-29 in Berlin would go on.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Former Liberation Army to disband </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 16 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Azanian
People's Liberation Army (APLA), which has played a role in the
struggle against the apartheid regime, is to be disbanded
Saturday, it was announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Pan Africanist Congress (PAC), of which APLA is the armed
wing, said disbanding APLA would speed up the integration process
of the South African National Defense Force (SANDF) and help
achieve real unity among former liberation fighters and government
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
A former member of the APLA high command and now a South
African navy admiral, Mosoeu Magalefa, said 10,000 former APLA
soldiers were expected to take part in a parade Saturday in Umtata
to mark the disbandment, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Although APLA abandoned the armed struggle in 1993, its
existence created an untenable situation for former members who
had since been integrated into the national defense force,
Magalefa said.
</P>
<P>
Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), former armed wing of the African
National Congress (ANC), was disbanded in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Magalefa, a member of the SANDF's integration committee, said
the defense force was still fragmented with people being labelled
ex-APLA, ex- MK or ex-South African Defense Force members.
</P>
<P>
"It is time for us to remove misgivings or suspicions among our
 colleagues in the SANDF," Magalefa said. "We as members of APLA
can no longer be seen as people with a split loyalty."
</P>
<P>
He said a cut-off date should be announced for members of
former armed forces to join the national defense force, allowing
it to concentrate on other issues such as transformation.
</P>
<P>
APLA was formed as Poqo in 1961, shortly after the 1960
Sharpeville massacre, when police shot dead 67 people protesting
against the former government's pass laws.
</P>
<P>
Its head office was based in Tanzania. Soldiers received
training in countries such as Libya, Egypt and Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Inflation Hits Record 50 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's February year-on-year
inflation has hit an all time high of 50 percent since August 1992
when a level of 49. 1 percent was recorded, the Central
Statistical Office (CSO) said in its latest review of price trends
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This was a 5.8 percentage points increase from 44.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) stood at 859.8 in February,
representing an increase of 9.4 percent on the January level of
785.7.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990 the highest peak reached was in August 1992 of 49.1
percent followed by 46.9 percent in September of that year.
</P>
<P>
The lowest inflation was in November 1996 at 13.9 percent and
throughout in the 90s Zimbabwe's inflation had never fallen below
the two digit level.
</P>
<P>
Of the 50 percent inflation rate in February, increases in food
prices accounted for 27 percentage points while non-food items in
the CPI accounted for 23 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
Independent economist John Robertson said there was no need to
expect anything better in view of the current poor performance of
the economy.

<HEADLINE> Low Yields Expected in Zimbabwe This year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's crop yields for the
1998/99 agricultural season will be below the expected level
because of various problems resulting from the above normal rains,
the Zimbabwean Farmers Union (ZFU) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
ZFU Director Kudakwashe Matekaire told the Zimbabwe News Agency
Ziana that the yields for the maize crop would be well above a
million tons.  Last year's maize crop reached 1.4 million tons.
</P>
<P>
He said the maize crop in most parts of the country suffered
heavily from water logging and leaching while in some dry areas it
was drought stressed.
</P>
<P>
The cotton crop, he said, suffered because pesticides were
washed way.
</P>
<P>
Cotton was a sunshine crop and most of the time it was overcast
and this reduced the cotton balls, he said.
</P>
<P>
The failure to secure loans from banks and the Agricultural
Finance Corporation would contribute to the low yields expected
this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that livestock was also affected although there was a
lot of grass. The grass which suffered from leaching lacked the
required nutrients.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe this year received above normal rains due to the La
Nina phenomenon, the persistent cooling of the sea temperatures
over the tropical Pacific Ocean.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Begins to Assess External Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has begun a
process of determining the nation's actual external indebtedness
as Nigeria and the Brettonwood institutions have disagreement over
t he debt profile.
</P>
<P>
The government of Nigeria has in this year's budget put the
nation's external debt profile at 28 billion U.S. dollars, but the
World Bank continued to insist on a higher figure, media reports
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted an official at the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) based in Lagos as saying Monday that "no one can say
how much the country is owing."
</P>
<P>
Neither the IMF and the World Bank, nor the Nigerian government
can say what the country owed its external creditors, IMF acting
Chief Public Affairs Official Bruno Mauprivez added.
</P>
<P>
IMF's African Department official Brian Ames noted that Nigeria
has not been able to manage the compilation of its external debt
profile properly.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the problem to the movement of government
departments from Lagos to Abuja and lack of adequate and efficient
computerization system.
</P>
<P>
In conjunction with the Department for International
Development, a British agency, Nigeria is currently making efforts
to reconcile the actual external debt figure.
</P>
<P>
It was learnt that the on-going reconciliation of the debt
profile would be completed by July this year.

<HEADLINE> Serb Delegation Calls for Amending Agreement on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The Serb President Milan
Milutinovic said on Tuesday that the political agreement on
autonomy in Kosovo should be amended and reaffirmed the rejection
by Belgrade of a deployment of NATO force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Serb delegation has submitted a proposal on amending the
political agreement on autonomy in Kosovo to the international
mediators and the representatives of the six-nation Contact Group.
</P>
<P>
This took place after the Kosovo Albanian delegation said on
Monday that it would sign the draft agreement on Kosovo prepared
by the international community.
</P>
<P>
``We are ready to sign political agreement. I say `political,'
but on condition that the amendments which we presented yesterday
should be accepted,'' said Milutinovic at the Center of
International Conference where the talks on Kosovo are being held.
</P>
<P>
He said that the amendments proposed by the Serbs fall in line
with the points of agreement reached in Rambouillet three weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
``We are waiting for the answer to these proposals,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that the Yugoslav government has demanded that
there should be a political agreement first, and only after that
could the method on implementing the agreement be talked about.
</P>
<P>
``First a political agreement and afterwards only a discussion
on its implementation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
On the sending of a NATO-led international force to Kosovo,
Milutinovic answered, ``It has been clearly rejected by our
people.''

<HEADLINE> Canada to increase Emergency Food Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Canada announced Tuesday that
Canada, through the Canadian International Development Agency
(CIDA), will increase its emergency food aid package to respond to
extraordinary food relief requests.
</P>
<P>
The new food aid package, totalling 29 million Canadian dollars
(19 million U.S. dollars), is expected to reach over 850,000
people, around the world, who are in emergency situations, said a
news release.
</P>
<P>
"The increase in the number of natural disasters and civil
conflicts around the world last year, coupled with the increase in
the numbers of people affected, has placed an enormous strain on
the ability of many developing countries to provide enough food to
feed their people," said Canadian International Cooperation
Minister Diane Marleau in the release.
</P>
<P>
"In response to the magnitude of the emergencies, CIDA is
allocating new money to used primarily to support major emergency
food aid operations, world-wide," added the minister.
</P>
<P>
The new food aid package will be used by Canadian
non-governmental organization and the United Nations to buy
foodstuff. For example, 3 million Canadian dollars (1.98 million
U.S. dollars) will go to aid programs in Central American
countries affected by Hurricane Mitch. The storm destroyed most of
the crops and left thousands homeless in the affected countries of
the region. Emergency relief efforts in other countries, including
Ethiopia, China, Afghanistan, and Indonesia, will also benefit
from this aid package.
</P>
<P>
Approximately one-half of the food commodities purchased under
this initiative will be in the form of Canadian wheat. Other
Canadian foods, such as pulses and edible oil, will make up the
majority of the balance.
</P>
<P>
This initiative will have a spin-off benefit of generating new
sales for Canadian food producers, who are facing economic
difficulties in the current environment of low international
commodity prices, said the release.

<HEADLINE> Rebels Kill 210 Kabila's Fighters in Southeast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Congolese rebels fighting to oust
 president Laurent Kabila from power claimed that they had killed
210 of Kabila's fighters, including 80 Zimbabweans in clashes near
Kabinda town Monday, the Rwanda News Agency (RNA) reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
''Those killed included the Zimbabwean area commander in Kabinda
zone,'' one rebel commander, based in Kisangani, the third
largest city of former Zaire, was quoted as sayingTuesday.
</P>
<P>
The fighting broke out at dawn when Kabila's forces and allies
tried to launch an assault on the Lubao Front, said the commander,
which RNA did not give his name.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, now advancing toward Kabinda, 150 km east of
mineral-rich Mbuji-Mayi town in eastern Kasai Province, also
claimed they had captured two tanks, two armored personnel
carriers and taken four prisoners of war during the fighting.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Rwandan ministry of defense predicted that
 Kabinda is about to fall in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The rebels are backed by Rwanda and Uganda, while Zimbabwe,
Namibia, Angola and Chad, as well as regional guerrilla forces are
supporting Kabila in the seven-month old civil war.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to broker a peace deal in the conflict have failed to
materialize because Kabila continued to refuse to engage in direct
talks with the rebels, alleging that he is faced with foreign
aggression.

<P>
PARIS, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The six-nation Contact Group on
former Yugoslavia rejected on Tuesday a request by the Serbs for
substantial amendments to be made in the draft peace agreement on
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman of the Contact Group countries -- the United
States, Russia, France, Britain, Germany and Italy -- said that
many changes as are demanded by the Yugoslav delegation concern
some fundamental elements which have already been agreed upon
during the Rambouillet talks three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
``The changes... would jeopardize the key elements of the
agreements of Rambouillet,'' said the spokesmen in a statement.
</P>
<P>
They said that the Yugoslav delegation was told that only
technical adjustments could be considered for the political wing
of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav delegation presented Monday evening a request for
substantial amendments to be made in the political part of the
agreement on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Both the Yugoslav side and the Kosovo Albanians accepted in
principle the political part of the agreement during the
Rambouillet talks.
</P>

The Albanian delegates said on Monday that they would sign the
agreement, which calls for substantial autonomy of Kosovo and the
disarming of the separatist force the Kosovo Liberation Army
(KLA).

But the Yugoslav side remains firm in its rejection of the
deployment of a NATO-led force in Kosovo to guarantee the
implementation of the agreement.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Creditors to Forgive African Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
proposed on Tuesday an initiative urging creditors to forgive 70
billion U.S. dollars in debt mostly for African countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening plenary of a U.S.-Africa ministerial
meeting at the State Department, the president said "today I ask
the international community to take actions which could result in
forgiving 70 billion dollars in global debt."
</P>
<P>
"What I am proposing is debt reduction that is deeper and
faster," Clinton told the ministers from 50 African countries.
</P>
<P>
In consultation with Congress, Clinton proposed making
significant improvements to an initiative by heavily indebted poor
countries at the G7 summit in Cologne, Germany, in June.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to ensure that no country committed to fundamental
reform is left with a debt burden that keeps it from meeting its
people's basic human needs and spurring growth," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he would work with G7 colleagues on a plan for
"complete forgiveness" of bilateral concessional loans, rather
than rescheduling as is done at present, and forgiveness of up to
90 percent of bilateral non-concessional debt.
</P>
<P>
He said his government would support gold sales by the
International Monetary Fund to do its part and additional
contributions by the United States and other countries to the
World Bank's Trust Fund to help meet the cost of the initiative.
</P>
<P>
To avoid recurring debt problems, Clinton said donor countries
should commit to provide at least 90 percent of new development
assistance to countries eligible for debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
He said a new approach should also be taken toward countries
emerging from conflicts that had not had the chance to establish
reform records and needed immediate relief and concessional
financing.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said in his budget request for the 2000 fiscal year he
had asked for 237 million dollars for relief of African debt on
top of the 245 million dollars covered in this year's
appropriation.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has planned to modernize its
industry in cooperation with the European Union (EU), the
country's Middle East News Agency reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The modernization program to upgrade 5,000 industrial firms
across Egypt is estimated to cost 827 million euros (909.7 million
U.S. dollars), Egyptian Minister of Industry Suleiman Reda told a
symposium late Monday.
</P>
<P>
The EU will offer Egypt 650 million euros (715 million dollars)
in grants and loans for the project, Reda said. The Egyptian
government and the private sector will cover the rest of the cost,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Experts from Portugal, France and Spain will help the Egyptian
enterprises to carry out the program, Reda said.
</P>
<P>
The renovation and development program will enable the Egyptian
industry to open new markets for export and withstand the
challenges prompted by globalization, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The plan will be referred to the People's Assembly (parliament)
for approval early next month and a relevant agreement will be
concluded with the EU in July.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Calls for Urgent Funds to Feed 1 Million Tanzanians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. World Food
Program (WFP) has appealed to donors for contributions to feed
over a million Tanzanians suffering from severe food shortages.
</P>
<P>
Due to serious crop failures in Tanzania, WFP said over the
weekend that it needs to begin distributing food immediately to
1.4 million people living in 12 regions of the East African
country.
</P>
<P>
However, a recent appeal to donors for 20,000 metric tons of
food aid valued at about 8 million U.S. dollars raised only half
that amount.
</P>
<P>
According to WFP's country director for Tanzania Irene Lacy, if
the agency did not get additional funds to mount the operation
soon, malnutrition and other hunger-related diseases might cost
human lives.
</P>
<P>
"The food aid, we're planning to distribute is the very minimum
needed to stave off a major crisis," she said.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, WFP has approved a 23 million U.S.
dollars of emergency food aid program for people facing severe
food shortages in Mauritania, Senegal, Gambia and Cape Verde.
</P>
<P>
The six-month operation will provide food to more than one
million people living in areas affected by drought and
below-average harvests.

<HEADLINE> Study Links Amino Acid to Disappearance of Rare Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- British scientists claimed Tuesday
they may have identified the reason why some children with a rare
form of brain cancer are spontaneously cured.
</P>
<P>
In the UK, every year just over 70 children develop
neuroblastoma, the tumor which can be highly dangerous and spread
to other parts of the body. But in five percent of cases, the rare
cancer mysteriously disappears.
</P>
<P>
A team of British scientists, led by Professor David Latchman
from University College London, believed the reason is that the
cancer cells spontaneously switch back to normal ones.
</P>
<P>
The scientists suggested that two molecules may play a key role
in the switch. The molecules are thought to act like traffic
lights, with one telling the tumor to convert to a normal cell and
the other telling it to remain as a cancerous cell.
</P>
<P>
The team found that the presence of just one amino acid, the
building block of proteins, can make the difference between
whether a molecule tells the tumor cell to become normal or stay
cancerous.
</P>
<P>
In laboratory tests, the scientists found that the message
given by the molecules can be changed by simply adding the amino
acid.
</P>
<P>
The team is now looking more closely at the amino acid to see
how it affects the way the molecules interact with other proteins
in the body.
</P>
<P>
Further study could lead to the development or gene therapy to
treat neuroblastoma, said the scientists.

UNITED NATIONS, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council's Sanctions Committee approved additional five
contracts for Iraq's oil industry last week, the U.N. Office of
the Iraq Program (OIP) said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
OIP said the approved five contracts are worth 6,524,196, U.S.
dollars, bringing the total approved to 391 worth 236, 014,692

</P>
<P>
According to the oil-for-food program, Iraq is allowed to
sell 5,2 billion worth of oil in every six months to purchase
necessities for its people who have been under sanctions since
1990. Under the current phase, Iraq can import 300 million dollars
worth of spare parts for its shabby oil industry.

<HEADLINE> Iran Blames Gulf States for Maneuvers with U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Tuesday blamed the Gulf
states for conducting joint military exercises with the United
States and Britain in the region.
</P>
<P>
"If there is any criticism, it should go to those maneuvers
held jointly with the U.S. and Britain which have no rights in the
region," the Iranian Government Spokesman Ataollah Mohajerani
told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The criticism came one day after foreign ministers of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) issued a statement in the Saudi capital
of Riyadh, criticizing Iran for staging military maneuvers in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani, also Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance,
said Iran considers launching its maneuvers as a natural and
indisputable right and all countries in the region are entitled to
maintain their defensive capabilities.
</P>
<P>
Iran has always tried to develop its relations with its
neighbors on the basis of mutual respect, the spokeman said, in
response to accusations from Qatar that the war games pose a
threat to the countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian navy staged a nine-day military maneuver earlier
this month near Abu Musa island, over which the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) also claims sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The GCC foreign ministers on Monday called on Iran to settle
its disputes with the UAE over the three islands of Abu Musa, the
Greater and the Lesser Tunbs near the strategic shipping lane at
the mouth of the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi on Monday
evening turned down the GCC call, saying that Tehran has the
absolute right to stage military maneuvers for defensive purposes
and to safeguard the territorial integrity of the country.
</P>
<P>
He denied the GCC's support for the UAE sovereignty over the
disputed islands, stating the three islands are an inseparable part
of the Iranian territory.
</P>
<P>
Asefi said the only way to settle the existing
"misunderstanding" between Iran and the UAE is to hold bilateral
talks.
</P>
<P>
Iran took over the islands in 1971 after the British forces
pulled out from the region. However, both Tehran and Abu Dhabi
claim sovereignty over the islands.
</P>
<P>
During the past years, Iran insisted on bilateral talks to
solve the issue, but the UAE called for an international
arbitration.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. and British warplanes on
Tuesday continued their daily raids against Iraqi civilian and
military targets, an Iraqi military spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman was quoted by the Iraqi News Agency as saying
that at 11 a.m. (0800 GMT), eight formations of enemy planes
coming from Turkish airspace violated northern Iraqi airspace over
Dohuk, Erbil and Neiveva provinces.
</P>
<P>
These warplanes shelled civilian installations and military
sites in the northern city of Mosul, said the spokesman, adding
Iraqi air defense units fired back and forced enemy planes to
flee.
</P>
<P>
Confrontations between Iraqi air defenses and U.S. and British
warplanes patrolling the no-fly zones almost occurred every day
since the mid-December U.S.-British air strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed the no-fly zones in Iraq
in the wake of the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of protecting
the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from
what they call "Baghdad's suppression."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has declared that it does not recognize the no-fly zones
and will fire at any allied warplanes violating its airspace.

<HEADLINE> Iran Releases 450 Iraqi POWs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Monday released some 450
Iraqi prisoners of war (POWs), said an Iraqi foreign ministry
spokesman on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency quoted the unnamed spokesman as saying
they are the first group of remaining Iraqi POWs to be freed
by Iran.
</P>
<P>
The move came under an agreement signed in the fourth meeting
of the Iraqi-Iranian joint committee for POWs held in Tehran on
November 14 to 26 last year.
</P>
<P>
These POWs should have been set free on December 23 last year
under the deal, said the spokesman, adding another group of POWs
should have been released on January 23, 1999.
</P>
<P>
However, some obstacles led to the delay of such release as
scheduled, said the spokesman without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
In return, the Iraqi government released 54 Iranian detainees
and prisoners to show Iraq's good will.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi foreign ministry appreciates the Iranian initiative
in releasing the Iraqi POWs and hopes that all the remaining Iraqi
POWs will be set free soon so as to end up their sufferings and
those of their families, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and Iran, two former foes that fought an eight-year
bitter war in the 1980s, have improved relations since early last
year by swapping POWs and exchanging remains of those killed in
the 1980-1988 war.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Special Envoy Shocked by Sarajevo Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The special representative
of the U.N. secretary-general, Elisabeth Rehn, voiced her shock
and horror at the car-bomb explosion on Tuesday morning in
Sarajevo, capital of Bosnia, which injured Jozo Leutar, deputy
minister of interior of the Bosnia and Hezergovina's Moslem-Croat
federation, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
Condemning it in the strongest terms, Rehn said that whatever
the purpose of this act, it is doomed to fail. The violent actions
of a few cannot destroy the seed of peace which has firmly taken
root in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
The bomb went off at 06:50GMT near Leutar's home in central
Sarajevo, local police said. Two other occupants in the car
sustained lesser injuries.
</P>
<P>
Rehn expressed her appreciation of Leutar's work, particularly
with regard to his contribution to the establishment of the
Federal Ministry of Interior, and wished Leutar and his colleagues
"a full and speedy recovery," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina "will not spare any
effort to support the work of the local police to ensure that the
perpetrators of this cowardly act are brought to justice," said
the special envoy.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's incident comes at a time when Bosnian Croats are
growingly complaining about their status inside the Moslem-Croat
federation, which together with the Serb republic make up post-war
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
In February, a Bosnian Croat police officer was injured in a
bomb attack in the central town of Tranik, also the scene of other
such attacks in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-brokered 1995 Dayton accord ended the 1992-1995
Bosnian war by dividing the country into the federation and the
Serb republic.

<HEADLINE> Arabs Back Palestinian Statehood: Moussa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said Tuesday it was a united and unbargainable Arab stand
to support the establishment of a Palestinian state with Jerusalem
as its capital.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at Jordan's southern port city of Aqaba,
where leaders of the two countries were attending an inauguration
ceremony of a joint power grid between the two states.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the ceremony, Moussa said that the
Palestinian state must be eventually established in the West Bank
and the Gaza Strip with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
He described the setup of a Palestinian state as an important
strategic choice and a united stand of all Arab countries, which
can not be bargained.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that the final status of Jerusalem would not
be subjected to policies of the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
However, Moussa apparently dodged a sensitive question whether
his country would support a plan by Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat to unilaterally declare an independent state on May 4.
</P>
<P>
The timing for establishing a Palestinian state is a "technical
issue" which can be open to discussions, he said.
</P>
<P>
The interim Oslo peace agreement between Israel and the
Palestinians expires on May 4, and Arafat is holding extensive
consultations with Arab and western countries on whether to
unilaterally declare the Palestinian state on the day.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace process has been deadlocked since
the end of 1998, with the two sides accusing each other of failing
to fulfill obligations stipulated in the latest Wye River peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, Israel should have withdrawn its troops from
another 13 percent of the West Bank while the Palestinian
authorities launched tougher actions against Islamic militants.

KUWAIT CITY, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti National Assembly
(parliament) Tuesday called on the international community and
peace-loving nations to help end Israel's occupation of Lebanon's
territories.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on the occasion of the 21 anniversary of
Israel's invasion of Lebanon on March 14, 1978, the parliament
also urged the Kuwaiti government to extend further support,
Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The 66-member legislature expressed hope that the Kuwaiti
government would help the Lebanese people end the Israeli
occupation and support the "resistance forces of the south and
west Bekka in their struggle against the brutal Israeli
aggression."
</P>
<P>
The statement said the Kuwaiti people remembered with deep
sorrow the Zionist invasion of south Lebanon, in which hundreds of
civilians were killed or wounded and thousands were made
homeless.
</P>
<P>
The tragedy is still a bleeding wound and witness to Israel's
aggressive and expansionist policies, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The occupation of the Lebanese land is a blatant defiance to
the international law and the principles of the international
legitimacy, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 with a
claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese guerrilla
cross-border attacks.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Inaugurates Tehran-Qom Express </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami on Tuesday inaugurated an express railway linking the
capital and the holy city of Qom in central Iran.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the inaugural ceremony of the railway, Khatami
said the country's railroads have increased to more than
6,700 kilometers from 5,000 kilometers before the 1979 Islamic
revolution.
</P>
<P>
However, he expressed regret that Iran in terms of railways
is not at a satisfactory level, he said.
</P>
<P>
Some 23 million U.S. dollars in addition to 210 billion rials
(about 70 million dollars at the official rate) have been spent
so far on the 137-kilometer railway, the Islamic Republic News
Agency said, adding an additional 65 billion rials (about 21.6
million dollars) are needed to complete the project.
</P>
<P>
The second line of the railway will become operational by
the first half of the coming Iranian calendar year to start
March 21 and when completed, the railway will help transport
5.5 million passengers and eight million tons of cargo annually.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Parliament Passes Copyrights Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Parliament Tuesday
approved the long-awaited intellectual property rights law, the
official National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Nebih Berri said the law was endorsed after
getting written guarantee from major software companies, which
promised to sell softwares to schools at a discount of 74 to 99
percent and set up an educational information network among
schools.
</P>
<P>
"The law is very important and we are late for passing it as
all developed countries have approved it," Berri added.
</P>
<P>
The legislation of copyrights law came under the strong
pressure from western countries, especially the United States,
and international software companies.
</P>
<P>
Software manufacturers have complained that they lost millions
of dollars each year due to illegal software production in
Lebanon, where the piracy rate is estimated at 80 percent or
higher.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. software giant Microsoft Co. has said it will not open
a regional office in Beirut until Lebanon ratifies a bill on
intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese parliament has been hesitating to pass the law
because some of its lawmakers fear an anti-piracy law will
eventually harm the interests of students who can not afford to
buy the costly original softwares.

<HEADLINE> Three Deals Signed for Oil Prospection in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Egypt on Tuesday signed three
agreements with foreign companies in off-shore oil prospection in
the Mediterranean Sea.
</P>
<P>
Under a deal signed with Shell, Egypt offered a concession to
the multinational oil company in an area of 41,500 square
kilometers in the Mediterranean northwest of Egypt, the country's
Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Shell will invest a minimum of 230 million U.S. dollars in
prospection and drill 10 exploratory wells, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
A second agreement allows the Italian international company Eni
to carry out oil prospection in a 919-square-kilometer area north
of Bardawil, 190 kilometers northeast of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The company is to spend 60 million dollars in oil prospection
and drill nine wells.
</P>
<P>
The third deal is an amendment to an agreement with Amoco,
under which the United States company will spend 450 million
dollars and drill nine wells.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Petroleum Hamdi el-Banbi said after the
signing ceremony that the investments of foreign companies in oil
prospection in Egypt have not been affected by the low-level oil
prices in the world markets.
</P>
<P>
Foreign oil companies have not reduced investments in Egypt,
instead, a number of them have increased investments and intend to
expand their activities, el-Banbi said.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav
troops and police fought with Kosovo separatists on Tuesday after
they were attacked by mortars and automatic weapons.
</P>
<P>
The troops and police, who were doing their field drills in
northern Kosovo, returned fire and forced the armed separatists
back into nearby Mount Cicavica, according to sources of the
Yugoslav Third Corps in Pristina.
</P>
<P>
The fights took place around the villages in between Kosovska
Mitrovica and Vucitrn, some 35 kilometers north of the capital of
the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
The army brought in reinforcement of tanks and armored
personnel carriers and suffered no casualties during the ensuing
clash, the military sources said.
</P>
<P>
The clash was confirmed by the Kosovo Verification Mission of
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, that sent
several of its orange-colored jeeps and armored jeeps to the
fighting spots, where a couple of houses were hit by the
cross-fires.
</P>
<P>
Armed clashes kept breaking up in the past few days, even on
the day when the Kosovo peace talks resumed Monday in Paris.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav army and police had fended off the offensives from
the separatists in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> No Large Military Operation on Iraq: U.S. General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. General
Anthony Zinni, Commander of U.S. forces in Gulf, dismissed on
Tuesday speculations that Washington is planning to launch
large-scale military operations against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British aircraft "are currently implementing United
Nations resolutions concerning the no-fly zones in north and south
Iraq," Zinni said in an interview with Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Defending the recurrent U.S.-led strikes against Iraqi targets
inside the no-fly zones, Zinni said "all the strikes that have
been carried out by our planes are in self defense."
</P>
<P>
"These strikes could stop at any time provided that the Iraqi
regime refrains from striking out aircraft," said the general, who
returned from a tour of U.S. troops stationed at Kuwait's Doha
Camp, about 60 kilometers north of the capital.
</P>
<P>
General Zinni arrived in Kuwait Monday for a two-day visit as
part of a regional tour that has taken him to Egypt and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
He also stopped Sunday at the international defense
exhibition, the region's largest arms show, in the United Arab
Emirates.
</P>
<P>
Prior to his visit to Doha Camp, the U.S. general held talks
with Kuwaiti Prime Minister Crown Prince Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Sabah
and Kuwaiti Defense Minister Salem Al-Sabah, the local television
station reported. But the TV reports didn't mention details of the
meetings.
</P>
<P>
There are about 4,000 U.S. troops based in Kuwait, with some
commissioned with safeguarding pre-positioned weapons and others
with conducting joint exercises with Kuwaiti armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait signed a 10-year defense cooperation pact with the
United States following the 1991 Gulf War that ended Iraq's
seven-month occupation of the oil-rich Gulf state.

<HEADLINE> Angola, IMF Talks in Positive Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Sources from the visiting
International Monetary Fund (IMF) delegation said here Tuesday its
negotiations with the Angolan government on the new economy
monitoring program are in "positive" progress.
</P>
<P>
Paulo Newhouse, head of the IMF delegation which arrived here
last Friday, said the implementation of the program projected at
monitoring government financial expenditure is the prerequisite
for Angola to obtain loans from the organization.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 national budget of Angola will be tabled to parliament
for approval at the end of this month and the IMF delegation will
evaluate the government's revenue and public payment policies,
according to Newhouse.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the IMF required the Angolan government to strictly
restrict its financial spending, lower inflation rate, be
transparent about its accounting, eliminate gradually government
control on foreign exchange, and implement the enhanced structural
adjustment facility as conditions for getting its low-interest
loans.
</P>
<P>
Due to the renewal of fighting between the Angolan government
and the rebel National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA) which has plunged the peace process into crisis, the
economy monitoring program failed to be implemented.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that the serious deficit in Angola's
finance will hardly be averted given the escalating military
expenditure and increasing refugees which now recorded at over 20
million. Therefore, it is difficult for the IMF and the Angolan
government to reach an agreement on the new economy monitoring
program.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Work on Eradicating Tsetse Flies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The Science and Technology
Commission of Ethiopia announced here Tuesday that a laboratory
which will experiment with methods to eradicate tsetse flies,
vector of trypanosomiosis, will soon be set up in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian News Agency quoted Assefa Mebrate, coordinator of
the South Ethiopia Rift Valley Tsetse Fly Eradication Project, as
saying that the laboratory will alter the genetic make up of the
flies to stop them from multiplying.
</P>
<P>
The laboratory will be established at Kaliti, in the suburbs of
capital Addis Ababa to serve as a central supply of the altered
tsetse flies to affected areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia loses millions of dollars annually as a result of
trypanosomiosis which "is taking a heavy toll on its cattle
resources", said the coordinator.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that ten million of the 30 million head of
cattle in Ethiopia are found in tsetse fly infested regions
covering about 200,000 square km of land. The southwestern and
northwestern parts of the country are rife with the tsetse flies.

<HEADLINE> EU, US at Odds Over Common Agriculture Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Commissioner for
agriculture, Franz Fischler, said here Tuesday that the European
Union (EU) has carried out the most radical reform on its common
agriculture policy (CAP) and made substantial changes in farm
expenditure, hardly no one could describe the changes as "status
quo".
</P>
<P>
He was responding to remarks by the US Agriculture Secretary
Glickman that the EU's reform agreement on CAP made last week is
"not much more than maintaining the status quo".
</P>
<P>
Describing the US comment as "incredible and regrettable",
Fischler said it would been wiser had Mr. Glickman taken some time
to study and analyze the agreement in detail before drawing
conclusions. "Had he done so, he would have appreciated that this
is the most radical reform ever carried out in the history of the
CAP."
</P>
<P>
The commissioner said the United States always had difficult
understanding of the philosophy underlying the CAP and of the
attachment the EU governments and citizens have to ensuring the
protection of Europe's rural heritage.
</P>
<P>
"It is unfortunate that the many years of discussions and
clarifications do not seem to have led to any greater appreciation
on their part," Fischler added.
</P>
<P>
It is to be clear, Fischler said in a statement, that the EU
and US share many common interests on agriculture, it is equally
clear that we have important differences in terms of the
objectives of our respective agricultural policies. "There is no
reason why both policies cannot coexist in a non conflictual way."
</P>
<P>
He also told his US partners that the multifunctional aspect of
the EU's agriculture policy is not for negotiation and EU has no
intention of sacrifying it on the "altar of free trade". Fischler
pointed out that the outcome of Agenda 2000, the EU's reform
program, is not an opening bid in the WTO discussions foreseen but
rather the policy with which any future WTO agreement must be
fully compatible.
</P>
<P>
Finally he said that rather than permanently attacking the CAP,
the US should perhaps examine their own policies which provide
substantially more assistance per US farmer than the CAP does for
EU farmers, but in less transparent way and for less of a return
to society.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, it should be recognized that far from being a
"fortress-Europe", the EU is the largest importer of food and
agricultural products in the world, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
on Tuesday attached great importance to the effective
international monitoring of the arms embargo against Yugoslavia
under the Security Council Resolution 1160, adopted in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the press, the president of the
15-member Council, Qin Huasun of China, said that "members of the
Council reiterate the importance of effective international
monitoring of the arms embargo established by Council Resolution
1160."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council members "remind all States of the need to
strictly implement arms embargo and to submit to the Committee the
necessary information on violations of the embargo," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
"Members of the Security Council endorse the report of the
Sanctions Committee," and "express their gratitude to the
Committee and its Chairman for their work," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Members of the Council reiterate their full support of the
enhancement of effectiveness of the Committee and express their
intention to follow its activities closely," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council adopted Resolution 1160 on March 31, 1999,
deciding to impose arms embargo on the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia. China, one of the five permanent members of the
Security Council, abstained from the voting.

MOSCOW, March 16 (Xinhua) -- More than 500 former members of
the Latvian SS marched Tuesday in Riga, capital of the Baltic
country, to commemorate their comrades-in-arms killed during the
Second World War, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Russia has called the procession an insult to those who fought
Nazism. The procession also aroused protests from Jewish
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about 300 anti-fascists assembled around the Liberty
monument, which was the destination of the march, singing Soviet
patriotic songs and carrying posters saying, "Millions of lives
are on the conscience of the SS" and "no place for the brown
plague in Latvia," Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Latvian Foreign Minister Valdis Birkavs condemned the rally,
saying it could be "used to defame Latvia's image."
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir
Rakhmanin blasted the proposal to turn March 16, the birthday of
Latvia's Waffen-SS legion, into a national holiday.
</P>
<P>
That "can only be assessed as blasphemy towards those who
fought fascism and the memory of the many millions of victims of
that criminal ideology," Rakhmanin said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Moves to Solve Grievances in Niger Delta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- A special committee set up by the
Nigerian government Tuesday presented a report to Nigeria's Head
of State General Abdulsalami Abubakar, advocating a 20-year master
plan for the development of Niger Delta.
</P>
<P>
Oladayo Popoola, chairman of the 22-member committee charged
with evolving short and long term development options for the
area, said here Tuesday that a development council would be set up
for the area to coordinate various development projects.
</P>
<P>
The report presented by the committee proposed that rural
electrification projects for the area estimated at 1.7 billion
naira (about 20 million U.S. dollars) should be completed before
the handover of power on May 29.
</P>
<P>
Another 15.3 billion naira (about 178 million dollars) should
be made available to address the urgent infrastructural needs of
the area "to enable an immediate impact to be felt during the life
of this administration", the report said.
</P>
<P>
Two technical colleges should be built in Delta and Bayelsa
states in a bid to contribute to the development of the skills of
the youths of the area.
</P>
<P>
Popoola said, "The Niger Delta has the highest concentration of
 commerecial investments financed with public funds in the country
today."
</P>
<P>
He cited such investments as two refineries, a petrochemical
and a power plant in Rivers State, an aluminium smelting and a
newsprint plant in Cross Rivers State and a steel plant and a
power station in Delta State.
</P>
<P>
In spite of such investments, Popoola said, a combination of
difficult geographical terrain, the scaterred nature of
settlements, historical competition and mistrust among the ethnic
groups in the area have served to undermine the realization of
government objectives.
</P>
<P>
The Niger Delta area has been the scene of recent violent
demonstrations by Ijaw youths who were involved in intermittent
disruption of oil production activities, the mainstay of the
country's economy.
</P>
<P>
The lack of infrastructure and training of the youths are often
 criticized by Ijaw youths who have always alleged marginalization
of the Niger Delta in the West African country.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Gabrielle Kirk Mcdonald,
president of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former
Yugoslavia (ICTY), has tendered her resignation effective in
November 1999, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the reasons for her resignation, the U.N. spokesman
said that she had served two terms already, "and it's purely for
personal reasons that she would like to come home."
</P>
<P>
In a letter distributed to her staff Tuesday, she wrote, "I
will continue to support the work of the Tribunal in any way that
I can. I am sure each of you is as proud as I am to be part of
this historical development of international humanitarian law,
which the Tribunal represents."
</P>
<P>
"I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to have been a fellow
participant in the accomplishment of the Tribunal," the letter
said.
</P>
<P>
Mcdonald has failed in its repeated efforts to ask the U.N.
Security Council to impose one-sided pressure on Belgrade since
the breakout of the Kosovo crisis in February last year.
</P>
<P>
Some Security Council members have accused of the ICTY of being
used as a political tool on the issue of Kosovo, a province in the
Yugoslav Republic of Serbia, which constitutes the violation of
internal affairs of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
A native of the United States, Judge Mcdonald was elected by
the United Nations General Assembly as a Judge of the ICTY in
September 1993 and re-elected on May 20, 1997 for a second
four-year term.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Envoy: No Foreign Military Presence in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Ambassador to Russia
Borislav Milosevic said here Tuesday that Belgrade accepts no
military presence from any foreign country, even that of friendly
Russia.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat said the current talks on Kosovo in France might
be crowned by a political agreement if the sides "show flexibility
and determination to sign not a unilateral, but a mutually
acceptable document envisaging a real autonomy and providing for
no force scenarios," Itar-Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
"It is inadmissible to insist on unilateral concessions from
Belgrade, but if Albanians want autonomy they will have it,"
Milosevic said.
</P>
<P>
"We have agreed to a broad autonomy, but we cannot accept
Kosovo's Serb population becoming national minority," he added.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said it is possible that head of the would-be
Kosovo autonomy might be called president but it is "imperative to
specify the sphere of his competence which must not go outside the
framework of Serbia's constitution."
</P>
<P>
Kosovo is a region within Yugoslavia's Serbia Republic.
</P>
<P>
He expressed concern that certain U.S. and NATO military
circles are bent on sending combat units to Kosovo, a move which
targets to "reinforce NATO's southern flank."
</P>
<P>
Milosevic vowed that Belgrade will defend itself "by all means
available" in the event of foreign troops introduction to Kosovo,
Tass said.
</P>
<P>
However, the ambassador said he hopes that "all the talk about
possible force solution to the Kosovo problem is of tactical
character, and the world community will not allow military
interference into domestic affairs of a sovereign state."

the world community to combat drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the 42nd international conference on drugs held

Undersecretary Saleh Al-Sheikh said his country is greatly
concerned about the expansion of the illegal plantation of

<HEADLINE> DPRK Agrees to U.S. Access to Kumchang-ri Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Pyongyang Tuesday agreed to
Washington access to an underground site at Kumchang-ri with the
latter promising to improve bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached after lengthy talks between the two
countries with the latest in New York from February 27 to March
15, according to a DPRK-U.S. joint press statement issued here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The United States and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK) believe that "successful cooperation to remove U.S.
concerns about an underground site at Kumchang-ri will contribute
to improved relations between the two countries," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The text was read by U.S. Special Envoy Charles Kartman who
headed the U.S. delegation. Sitting by his side at a press
conference at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations was DPRK
delegation head Vice Foreign Minister Kim Gye Gwan.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK will provide the U.S. with "satisfactory access" to
the site "by inviting a U.S. delegation for an initial visit in
May 1999 and allowing additional visits to remove U.S. concerns
about the site's future use," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. has decided to take a step to improve political and
economic relations between the two countries," it added.
</P>
<P>
Both Kartman and Kim did not elaborate plans on the development
of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
A statement by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
released at the press conference said the U.S. has decided to take
"a concrete step in the form of a bilateral pilot agricultural
project."
</P>
<P>
However, Albright said the U.S. "did not agree to North Korean
demands for compensation" in return for access to the site.
</P>
<P>
Press reports said Washington has suspicions that the
Kimchang-ri site "may be part of a clandestine nuclear weapons
program." Pyongyang has denied it and asked the U.S. to compensate
if the site is not as what it was suspected.

<HEADLINE> Canada Cracks Down on Parks Poachers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian federal government
has introduced legislation to dramatically increase fines and jail
terms for poachers who hunt species like grizzlies in Canada's
national parks.
</P>
<P>
The new National Park Act, tabled Tuesday at the House of
Commons, allows judges to send poachers to prison for up to five
years, instead of what the current legislation calls for -- a
maximum jail term of six months.
</P>
<P>
Poachers could be fined 150,000 Canadian dollars (99,000 U.S.
dollars) for hunting or possessing "threatened" wildlife under the
act.
</P>
<P>
If enacted, the toughest penalties will be imposed on hunters
who poach or traffic endangered and threatened species like
mountain goats, grizzlies, bighorn sheep, peregrine falcons, polar
bears, or piping plover.
</P>
<P>
And the penalties for the lesser offense of hunting "protected
" species like American buffalo, American elk, caribou, cougars,
moose wolves, black bears, and white-tailed deer in national parks
are also going up.

<HEADLINE> Britain Favors G8 to Contribute to Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Britain supports leaders of the
Group of Eight (G8) countries to join hands in finding a solution
to the Cyprus issue, said British High Commissioner to Cyprus
David Madden on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after meeting with Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides,
Madden said both Britain and the U.S. intend to join in
"a continuing and very full international efforts to assist a
settlement."
</P>
<P>
Referring to reports that a senior U.S. official is working on
getting the G8 countries engaged in the Cyprus peace effort,
Madden said it should be seen "as part of continuing international
efforts to help and assist the parties here to come to a solution".
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third of the island
in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island,
but so far no tangible results have been achieved.
</P>
<P>
Madden is to leave Cyprus at the end of the month and in early
May he is due in Athens to take up the post of British Ambassador
to Greece.
</P>
<P>
The G8 countries include the United States, Germany, France,
Italy, Canada, Japan, Russia and Britain.

PARIS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The spokesman of the United States
State Department James Rubin arrived here on Wednesday to consult
with other Western diplomats on issues concerning the on-going
peace talks on Kosovo, said the U.S. embassy here.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the U.S. embassy said that the coming of Rubin

</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of the six-nation Contact Group will
discuss in the coming hours whether to prolong the talks or not.
</P>
<P>
The talks have come into a deadlock after the Yugoslav
delegation asked that amendments be made in the political part of
the peace plan for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
This request was rejected by the Contact Group, which said the
political part of the agreement was already negotiated in the
Rambouillet talks and cannot be changed.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade Tuesday also reaffirmed its opposition to the
deployment of NATO force in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Nation's Delinquency Rate on Mortgages Falls Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. nation's mortgage-
delinquency rate fell to its lowest level in more than two years
during the fourth quarter of 1998 as a strong economy and low
mortgage rates kept U.S. residents current with their housing
bills, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Mortgage Bankers Association of America said the nation's
delinquency rate fell to 4.24 percent from 4.37 percent for the
third quarter and stands at its lowest level since the third
quarter of 1996. The mortgage bankers' survey covers mortgage
loans on one-unit to four-unit residential properties and includes
about half of U.S. residential mortgages.
</P>
<P>
The group attributed the drop to a strong economy, which has
ensured low unemployment. Low mortgage rates have increased home
buying and refinancing, and the group noted that new mortgages
typically see fewer delinquency problems. Low rates encouraged
borrowers to take out fixed-rate mortgages instead of less-stable
adjustable-rate mortgages.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Still Faces Financial Difficulties, Officials Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations is
still facing financial difficulties despite the improvement in the
cash flow, U.N. officials said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis, which has long haunted the world body,
originated from the U.S. reluctance to pay its back dues.
</P>
<P>
The United States still owed 76 percent of all unpaid regular
budget assessments at the end of 1998, said Joseph Connor, the
U.N. under-secretary-general in charge of finance and budget. At
present, the United States owed 1.7 billion U.S. dollars of its
back dues.
</P>
<P>
"We have no capital, we have no reserves, we borrow form some
Member States to make up for the income we do not get from other
Member States," Connor said.
</P>
<P>
Connor told a meeting of the Administrative and Budgetary
Committee, also known as the Fifth Committee of the General
Assembly, that for the first time in four years, the Organization
was borrowing less from peacekeeping funds to cover regular budget
activities, and cash balances were higher.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the level of unpaid regular budget assessments was
decreasing substantially, Connor said.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, unpaid regular budget assessments had been 564 million
U.S. dollars while at the end of 1998, they came to 417 million
U.S. dollars and the deficit in the regular budget cash was down.
</P>
<P>
Many Member States, including some of its Western allies, have
frequently lashed out at Washington for its reluctance to pay its
back dues, repeatedly urging the United States to fulfill its
obligations under the U.N. Charter.

<HEADLINE> IMF, Angola Talks Make Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) said Wednesday that its talks with the government of Angola
on implementing an economic monitoring program have made "positive
progress."
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by leader of an IMF delegation in Angola,
Paulo Newhuose, who said here that implementation of the program
is a precondition for IMF to extend loans to Angola.
</P>
<P>
Newhuose arrived in the Angolan capital of Luanda last Friday.
He said Angola's ministries of finance and planning have showed
the utmost respect for IMF's assessment of the current situation
in the country and for its opinions on how Angola should proceed
in the present fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Newhuose, who is also in charge of IMF's African and Middle
East Affairs, said that although the present work remains to be
technical, it may produce far-reaching impact on future
agreements.
</P>
<P>
He said Angola's 1999 state budget proposals will be submitted
to parliament for approval at the end of this month, and that the
IMF delegation will evaluate the government policies on income and
public expenditure before making any suggestions.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the IMF worked out with the Angolan government a
similar program focusing on the stern control of the government
expenditure, curbing inflation, making the state account
transparent, and lifting of the government control over foreign
exchange step by step.
</P>
<P>
Another precondition for the IMF to extend loans to Angola is
smooth implementation of the economic monitoring program, which
means satisfying the terms of the Enhanced Structural Adjustment
Facility (ESAF).
</P>
<P>
ESAF is a favorable treatment given by the IMF to low-income
countries which are undergoing economic restructuring programs.
The ESAF loans are granted at a rate as low as 0.5 percent with a
long repayment period.
</P>
<P>
However, the eruption of the civil war in Angola again has
stalled the implementation of the monitoring program.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said it will be difficult for IMF to smoothly
reach an agreement with Angola on implementing a new economic
monitoring program as the civil war has forced the military
spending to shoot up and refugees to rise to more than 20 million.

<P>
TEHRAN, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Tehran police seized more than one
ton of narcotics and arrested 8,000 people for drug offenses
during the current Iranian calendar year to end on March 20, a
senior police officer said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Nasser Aslani, head of the anti-drug police in Tehran
province, said his forces confiscated 1,380 kilograms of drugs and
arrested more than 1,000 dealers and 6,748 addicts during the year.
</P>
<P>
Some 170 tonnes of various narcotics have been seized
throughout the country during the past 11 months of the year,
according to officials of the Iranian anti-drug headquarters
recently.
</P>
<P>
Iran has been committed to crackdown on drug smuggling since
1989 after its parliament passed a strict law, under which any one
caught with more than 30 grams of heroin or five kilograms of
opium will be sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
Reports said more than 3,000 drug dealers have been executed
since the law took effect, but there are no official figures to
confirm the reports.

<HEADLINE> EU Forensic Team Establishes No Massacre Case for Racak Incident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRISTINA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Finnish
forensic team, sent in by the European Union, did not establish a
case of massacre for the Racak incident, in which 40 people died
last January 15.
</P>
<P>
A conclusion of "massacre" did not fall within the competence
of the EU forensic team or any other person having participated
solely in the investigation of the bodies, read a summary given by
Helena Ranta, chief of the forensic team.
</P>
<P>
The Finnish woman pathologist told the press after handing over
the team's autopsy findings on the 40 bodies of local civilians to
the local Pristina district court and that Energy Dispersive X-Ray
Analyzer tests proved them to be unarmed.
</P>
<P>
Of the 40 bodies autopsied at Pristina, there was one woman and
several elderly men.
</P>
<P>
Previous western press reports claimed that there were 45
bodies including two women and one child, while the Kosovo cease-
fire verification mission of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe said that there were 41 bodies including
those of two women and one child.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the gunshot residue analyses, the Finnish forensic
team also confirmed that the dead people were civilians, for no
ammunition was found in their pockets.
</P>
<P>
"It is highly unlikely that clothes could have been changed or
removed," read the summary of the forensic investigation which
added that "no indication of tampering or fabrication of evidence
was detected".
</P>
<P>
The Finnish scientist only complained about the fact that 16
bodies had been autopsied before the pathologists from Finland,
Yugoslavia and Belarussia joined together. "It was against the
wish of our pathologists, " the summary said.
</P>
<P>
But the team admitted that all pathologists agreed upon common
methods and procedures after a demonstration autopsy and local
criminal and autopsy technicians contributed to the cooperative
working atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
"The Finnish team was able to complete its investigations
without any outside pressure," said Ranta.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav and Belarussian pathologists had earlier
established no case of massacre last month but the Finnish team
reserved its announcement only until after it had completed its
investigation.
</P>
<P>
"In Finland, ongoing investigations are not commented upon,"
said Ranta.
</P>
<P>
When asked why it took almost two months for her team to
announce its findings, Ranta said that the investigation was
complicated and it only completed a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
No sooner had the bodies been found close to Racak, a village
south to the Kosovo provincial capital of Pristina, William Walker,
head of the Kosovo Verification Mission alleged that it was a
massacre.
</P>
<P>
The Finnish pathologists said that laymen with little criminal
investigation knowledge may tend to interpret what they saw at the
site of the tragedy at Racak as massacre.
</P>
<P>
Ranta explained that the missing eyes and ears could be related
to animal activities such as stray dogs or to the high pressure of
projectiles.
</P>
<P>
The Finnish pathologist said that now it is up to the local law
enforcement authorities to piece together all evidence to
establish a criminal case.
</P>
<P>
However, Ranta emphasized that so many people died at "
approximately the same time" was a crime against humanity and she
appealed to the international community to continue what it has
been doing to help stop such crime in Kosovo, where so far some 2,
000 people died in armed conflicts.

<HEADLINE> Belgium Seeks Trial of Rwandan Genocide Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He said that as the second choice, Natuyahaga should be handed
over to the Tanzanian authorities and then be extradited to
Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Belgium's demand was put forward following the bid by the
Natuyahaga's prosecutor to seek withdrawing indictment against
him.
</P>
<P>
In the unprecedented application, Othman Chande argued that the
 withdrawal will promote the exercise of concurrent jurisdiction
by a state as contained in Article 8 of the Statute of the
tribunal.
</P>
<P>
He said that the accused on a single count indictment would not
fit into the prosecution's current strategy of showing the
genocide as a conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
He argued that the Belgian government has already investigated
the case and the families of the victims are also in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian investigating magistrate issued in 1995 an
international warrant of arrest of Natuyahaga, accusing him of
involving in the death of 10 Belgian peace keeping soldiers in the
United Nations Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR) on April 7,
1994 as well as former Rwandan Prime Minister Agathe
Uwilingiyimana.
</P>
<P>
However, Natuyahaga's defense counsel Georges Amegadjie from
Togo opposed the motion by the prosecution. He stressed that there
was no provision in the Statute or Rules of the ICTR empowering
the international tribunal to hand over an accused person to a
national jurisdiction if the prosecutor seeks to withdraw charges
as in the present case.
</P>
<P>
"The prosecution should not act as a rubber stamp for some
national jurisdictions. It is a United Nations body," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, the defense counsel said, the tribunal should
request the Belgian government to hand over all the documents and
evidence against the accused to the tribunal to facilitate the
case.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. court will deliver a ruling on the motion on Thursday.
 At least 500,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus were massacred
in a genocide that took place in the middle of 1994.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Interior Minister Decides to Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Interior Minister Dinos
Michaelides said Wednesday he has decided to submit his
resignation to President Glafcos Clerides by Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Michaelides' decision came only one day after the government
spokesman resigned for "a matter of principle" because he had
strongly disagreed with a cabinet decision, which exonerated
Michaelides from corruption allegations.
</P>
<P>
Michaelides had been accused by Christos Pourgourides,
president of the House of Representatives (parliament) Watchdog
Committee, for abuse of power at the immigration department and
unlawful enrichment through sale of apartments.
</P>
<P>
In a decision issued last Wednesday, the cabinet said that "no
further investigation is justified concerning the accusations."
</P>
<P>
Michaelides described his resignation as a political move to
protect Clerides, who a few months ago refused to accept
Michaelides' resignation following corruption accusation "from
increasing petty politics which have obvious objectives and
goals."
</P>
<P>
Thanking Clerides for his support and solidarity, the interior
minister said he intends to remain politically active.
</P>
<P>
Michaelides belongs to center-right Democratic Party (DIKO)
and served as interior minister in Clerides' first term in office
from 1993 to 1997, when DIKO was a coalition partner.
</P>
<P>
In late 1997 DIKO withdrew from the coalition, but Michaelides
decided to remain in the government.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Forms Task Force to Tackle Deadly Virus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Cabinet Wednesday
decided to set up a task force to tackle the outbreak of Japanese
encephalitis (JE), a deadly virus, in an integrated and
comprehensive manner.
</P>
<P>
The task force, to be headed by Health Minister Chua Jui Meng,
will comprise six ministries -- the Health Ministry, Agriculture
Ministry, Housing and Local Government Ministry, Information
Ministry, Defense Ministry and Home Ministry, according to the
Malaysian national news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
The task force will hold its first meeting Thursday and make
recommendations to the Cabinet which wanted top priority to be
given by all the six ministries and agencies under them to tackle
the problem, Bernama quoted Chua as saying.
</P>
<P>
Chua said that the Cabinet had agreed in principle that some
kind of humanitarian assistance be given to the pig farmers
affected by the JE outbreak.
</P>
<P>
According to Chua, until Wednesday 87 people believed to have
been affected by the JE had been admitted to hospitals and there
had been 47 deaths so far, 15 in the northern state of Perak and
32 in the southern state of Negeri Sembilan.
</P>
<P>
The government has decided to destroy some 100,000 pigs from
these two areas and dispose the carcasses, Bernama quoted another
federal minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik said, "The Cabinet was very
unanimous that it (JE) is a very urgent issue... The main issue is
to save human lives, meaning that all those residing around pig
farms or high-risk areas needed to be vaccinated."
</P>
<P>
The deadly JE virus spreads from pigs to humans by the culex
mosquito.

<HEADLINE> Machinery, Electronics Remain China's Leading Foreign Trade Items </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Machinery and electronics
continued to be the leading items in China's foreign trade in 1998,
according to the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China's imports and exports of machinery and electronics hit
130.4 billion U.S. dollars last year, up 9.9 percent from 1997.
This amount was 40.3 percent of China's total foreign trade volume
in 1998, up 3.6 percentage points from 1997, the ministry
announced at a meeting here today.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the exports and imports of machinery and
electronics totaled 65.54 billion US dollars and 63.87 billion US
dollars respectively in 1998, up 12.2 percent and 7.6 percent
respectively from the previous year.
</P>

Last year, China's machinery and electronics exports to Asia
declined while those to Europe, the United States, and Africa
jumped an average of 20 percent, said Guan Liyan, deputy director
of the ministry's Machinery and Electronics Import and Export
Department.
</P>
<P>
Automatic digital processing equipment, video equipment, and
aviation materials were the major growth areas in China's
machinery and electronics exports last year, Guan said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that machinery and electronics exports by overseas-
funded enterprises stood at 40.1 billion U.S. dollars of machinery

<HEADLINE> War Affects Tourism in Eritrea: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ASMARA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- War has affected Tourism in
Eritrea but the industry will recover before the year 2000
despite the on-going war with Ethiopia, Minister of Tourism Ahmed
Haj Ali said in Asmara Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The situation has bottomed out," Ahmed told Xinhua in an
interview here,

asserting that the war will not last forever.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest data provided by the ministry, the
inbound arrivals had dropped from 31,270 in May 1998 to 5,396 in
June of the year as a result of the outbreak of the Ethio-eritrean
border conflict.
</P>
<P>
"Tourism is a very sensitive sector," the minister said, noting
that even when there is natural catastrophe or epidemic, it is the
first sector to be affected.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed said that tourism has been affected after Ethiopia
imposed air and sea embargo on Eritrea. The three times a week
flights between Asmara and Addis ababa, capital of Ethiopia, was
forced to stop due to the escalating war.
</P>
<P>
Previously, tourism showed rosy signs in Eritrea as the
international tourist arrivals recorded 315,417 in 1995, followed
by 416,595 and 409,544 in 1996 and 1997 respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, because of the lasting war between the two horn of
Africa neighbors, the inbound arrivals in Eritrea went down to
187,720 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Since the conflict will not last forever, he said, the
international tourists are still coming, though not as many as
expected.
</P>
<P>
After all, he noted, the more than 1,000 kilometers of coast
line along the Red Sea, some 360 islands, excellent diving sites
with clean and unpolluted water, as well as the cultural
diversity, are all attractions for overseas tourists.
</P>
<P>
As the minister put it, one of the great civilizations was in
Eritrea and its capital Asmara has been dubbed as "the world of
arts dec o."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, Eritrea is full of potential with all kinds
of tourism including eco-tourism and cultural tourism.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea targets Europe as its major market, Ahmed said, citing
Italy, Germany, Britain, France and the Nordic countries.
</P>
<P>
In America, he said, Eritrea plans to attract tourists from the
United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
He said that in Middle East, Eritrea is looking at tourists
from Saudi Arabia and other countries in the Gulf Region.
</P>
<P>
In Asia, he said Eritrea sets eyes on Japan and the Republic of
Korea, while in Africa, it expect tourists from Sudan, Rwanda and
Uganda. Of course, he noted that before the conflict Ethiopia was
a major source of the inbound tourists.
</P>
<P>
Divestment in tourism as one major part of Eritrea's
privatization program has contributed much to the development of
the sector.
</P>
<P>
In fact, most of the state-run hotels had been privatized, the
minister said, noting that most of the big state-run hotels such
as Keren and Dahlak had been sold out.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said the state-run Ambasoira Hamasein Hotel,
named after a mountain in the province of Hamasein, formerly
called the Imperial Hotel, will be privatized this month or next
month.

<HEADLINE> China's Absence in WTO Adversely Affects World: Official Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Conclusion on China's accession into the WTO will need strong
political will, determination and vision in the key capitals of
the world, said Chulsu Kim, deputy Director-General of the WTO,
when addressing a conference on "Asia and the Future of the World
Economic System."
</P>
<P>
"Although China has been far less affected by the financial
crisis in Asia than other economies, it has played a critical role
in containing the crisis," he told the conference hosted by the
British Royal Institute of International Affairs.
</P>
<P>
"China's decision not to devalue its currency despite the
competitive pressures and her decision to maintain the momentum of
economic reforms in adverse economic conditions have earned her
greater credibility as an important and responsible participant in
the international trade and economic system," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kim also noted the intensification of China's accession
negotiation in recent months.
</P>
<P>
"We are now seeing a new determined push by China to conclude
its membership of the WTO as rapidly as possible," he observed,
adding that similar situations occurred during the Uruguay Round
and before the establishment of the WTO in January 1995.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, this time the difference seems to be that,
along with China, WTO members also regard the months ahead as "a
window of opportunity" to bring China into the WTO, for the
conviction that "failure would lead to an indefinite delay."
</P>
<P>
"I consider this shared perception a very positive development
because it may be just the catalyst that we need to bring about
flexibility and accommodation between China and its trading
partners," he said.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Faces Electricity Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is suffering a shortage of
electricity during the current dry season, Vietnam News Agency
(VNA) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam will face an estimated shortage of about 600 million
kwh of electricity this dry season because of the shortage of
investment capital for power projects, slow construction and the
imbalance between electricity consumption at peak and off-peak
hours, VNA quoted Director General of Electricity of Vietnam (EVN)
Hoang Trung Hai as saying.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, Hai said, electricity output has increased by 2.3
billion kwh and additional charge capacity has increased by 350 mw
annually.
</P>
<P>
However, to ensure the supply during the dry season, Vietnam's
power industry has to increase its output annually by between 400
and 500 mw and needs an investment capital of 13-16 trillion
Vietnamese dong (935 to 1,151 million U.S. dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
Although the power industry has mobilized capital for building
more power plants, it has not met the above-mentioned demand. The
industry has supplied an additional combined output of only 550 mw
in the 1995-1998 period.
</P>
<P>
To ease the shortage, EVN has taken drastic steps, focusing on
the maintenance and repair of power plant equipment. It has run
all its thermal power plants, diesel and gas turbines since late
1998 to meet the demand, Hai said.
</P>
<P>
EVN will coordinate with the mass media to call for minimal
electricity consumption in addition to seeking other electricity
sources and preparing options to alleviate the power shortage in
the dry season, Hai added.

Foreign institutional investors, however, were reportedly net
buyers in a few selected shares.

<HEADLINE> Horticulture Turns Major Cash Earner for Kenya: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mudavadi made the remarks while opening of the sixth
Horticulture Trade Exhibition, known as Hortec '99, the largest
and most influential show of its kind in Africa, at the Kenyatta
International Conference Center in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi
here.
</P>
<P>
During the show, over 110 exhibitors from South Africa, the
Netherlands, France, Israel, Spain, Britain and Kenya are
displaying over 200 species of flowers.
</P>
<P>
Seeds, greenhouse facilities, pesticides and fungicides, as
well as machinery, equipment and tools related to horticultural
production are also on display.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that horticulture is an important rural
occupation, and last year the sector earned the country a record
50 billion Kenya shillings (about 820 million U.S. dollars) in
output value.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in 1998 the horticultural sector in the county
exported nearly 79,000 tons of produce, raking in 14 billion
shillings and accounting for some 13 percent of Kenya's foreign
exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
Kenya had increased its market share at the Dutch auctions from
17 percent in 1993 to over 28 percent only three years later, and
is a leading exporter of cut flowers and related produce to
Europe, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that although horticulture now is the fourth highest
foreign exchange earner after tea, coffee and tourism, it has the
potential to emerge as Kenya's most important industry.
</P>
<P>
Occupying about 11 percent of the country's arable land,
horticulture becomes the source of income for many Kenyans, he
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Event and Conference Organizer Ltd., the
sponsor of the

Hortec '99, five seminar sessions on horticulture will be held
during the event, focusing on horticulture in east and central
Africa, financial management and technical issues, laboratory
services, trade and marketing.
</P>
<P>
During the 10-day show, lectures will also be presented by
experts from Holland, Britain and France.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Right-Wing Party Leader Convicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Aryeh Deri, leader of Israel's
powerful right-wing Shas Party, Wednesday was convicted of
bribe-taking by Jerusalem District Court.
</P>
<P>
Judge Yaakov Tzemach announced the verdicts on Wednesday
morning before reading a 917-page decision.
</P>
<P>
The judge said that Deri took about 160,000 U.S. dollars in
bribes in return for using his senior position in the Interior
Ministry to provide some organizations with special treatment and
government funding.
</P>
<P>
Deri, a close associate of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
was also convicted of fraud and breaching public trust. The judge
also sharply criticized that Deri had obstructed justice during
the investigation by exploiting his right of keeping silence.
</P>
<P>
Although Deri was acquitted on some other charges against him,
the bribery conviction carries a maximum sentence of seven years
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
The sentencing is due to take place on Thursday of next week.
</P>
<P>
According to Israel's law, Deri will be legally barred from
serving as a cabinet minister for 10 years from the day he
finishes serving his sentence.
</P>
<P>
In response, Deri's lawyer said that Deri totally rejected the
verdict and will appeal to the supreme court. Deri himself told
reporters that he will make an "orderly reaction" after a careful
consideration.
</P>
<P>
Shas Party, which currently has 10 seats in the 120-member
Knesset (parliament), is made up of Jews with Middle Eastern
origin.
</P>
<P>
Since it is only less than two months before the general
elections of Israel, Deri's conviction is likely to raise
tensions in the country.
</P>
<P>
Followers of Shas regarded the conviction as a ruling against
the whole party. And several hundred demonstrators protested
outside the court and near Deri's home. One demonstrator was
detained by police.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said that "this is a difficult day," but called on
the supporters of Shas to respect the law and act with restraint.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, local political analysts said that the
verdict could rally Shas supporters to the polls and help the
right-wing Netanyahu in the elections.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli police have been bracing for the verdict's
announcement, with assigning a bodyguard to each of the three
Jerusalem District Court judges who presided over the case and
reinforcing security around the court.
</P>
<P>
Police said said the judges received death threats several
times over the last few days.

<HEADLINE> UK House of Lords to Rule on Pinochet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 17 (Xinhua)-- The United Kingdom's Highest Court,
the House of Lords, will rule in one week on whether former
Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet is immune from arrest and
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
"The rule will be issued next Wednesday at 2 p.m.," a spokesman
for the House of Lords told Xinhua on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, 83, is still under house arrest in a mansion outside
London, waiting for a ruling on his claim to immunity.
</P>
<P>
He was arrested on October 16 at a London hospital at the
request of a Spanish judge.
</P>
<P>
Spain wants to extradite Pinochet and put him on trial for
accused crimes including genocide and torture committed under his
17-year rule in Chile, which ended in 1990. The Spanish judge said
Pinochet was responsible for the deaths and disappearances of 3,
000 people.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet's lawyers argued that he should enjoy immunity from
prosecution as a former head of state.
</P>
<P>
Last November, the House of Lords ruled that Pinochet had no
immunity from prosecution. But it had to set aside the ruling
after Pinochet's lawyers accused that one of the five Lords in the
panel had links with Amnesty International, the human rights body
which strongly supports Pinochet's prosecution.
</P>
<P>
The new panel formed by seven Lords held a three-week-long
rehearing of the case early this year without reaching an
immediate rule.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Italian Economic Ties Expected To Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Investment and trade between
China and Italy are expected to grow because of President Jiang
Zemin's visit to Italy at the end of this month, analysts here say.
</P>
<P>
China considers Italy an important trade partner in the EU. The
two countries had an overall trade increase last year of 3.5
percent to 4.8 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Chinese exports to Italy grew 15.1 percent to 2.577 billion
dollars, but imports declined 7.1 percent to 2.277 billion dollars,
according to China's General Customs Administration.
</P>
<P>
China mainly exports machinery and electronics products,
garments, and textile products and imports mainly textile
machinery, rubber and plastic processing machinery, and leather
products.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, Italy had launched 1,254 projects in China,
involving 2.1 billion U.S. dollars in Italian investment. Italy is
second only to Germany in Europe in technology transfers to China.
From 1981 to 1998, China imported 1,262 items of technology from
Italy, worth 7.2 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The two countries' economies complement each other, analysts
say, and bilateral investment and trade still have great potential.
</P>
<P>
Small and medium-sized companies play a leading role in Italy's
business. China's Foreign Trade Minister Shi Guangsheng says that
Italian companies are welcome to invest in and transfer technology
to China.

<HEADLINE> Most Urban Chinese Travel at Least Once Yearly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- About 60 percent of China's big-
city residents now travel domestically at least once a year,
according to a recent survey conducted by the China Youth Daily in
China's three major cities of Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
The survey also shows that 61.9 percent of Shanghai residents
are likely to join travel groups, while 82 percent of Beijingers
say they would rather travel by themselves or with their relatives
and friends.
</P>
<P>
During this year's Spring Festival vacation in February, the
survey pointed out, more than 18 million Chinese traveled, and
spent about 14 billion yuan (1.7 billion U.S. dollars) doing so.
</P>
<P>
Also during the Spring Festival holiday, according to the
survey, some 100,000 Beijingers, and even more Guangzhou residents,
traveled to Southeast Asian countries and regions. In Shanghai,
the number of people traveling abroad was twice those of last year.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that this increased travel will contribute
significantly to the expansion of domestic demand in China and
create more job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
At a conference on economic work held by the Central Committee
of the Communist Party of China last year, the tourism sector was
listed as one of the country's economic-growth focal points.

The names appearing frequently on leading newspapers are: NATO
Secretary General Javier Solana, former Italian Prime Minister
Romano Prodi and Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres.
</P>
<P>
"Speculation on a successor to Mr Santer centered on Javier
Solana, Secretary General of NATO, and Romano Prodi, former
Italian Prime Minister," the Financial Times said.
</P>
<P>
The Times reported that the "most mentioned candidates" are
Solana and Prodi.
</P>

It also said British Prime Minister Tony Blair was against
naming a stop-gap president.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph said two leading "heavyweights" favoured by
Britain were Guterres and Prodi.
</P>
<P>
But none of the newspapers have disclosed their sources for
their reports.
</P>

Jacques Santer and the entire commission resigned on Tuesday in

</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair told the Parliament on
Tuesday that Santer should step down "soon as possible". He said
the mass resignation of the commission members offered a chance to

<HEADLINE> Lao People's Revolutionary Party Holds Eighth Plenum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Lao People's Revolutionary
Party (LPRP) Central Committee has concluded its eighth plenum (VI
Congress) in Vientiane, urging the whole party, the army and the
people to exert every effort to implement the socio-economic
development plan, Lao official news agency KPL reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The plenum was held from March 9 to 16 under the chairmanship
of its President Khamtay Siphandone.
</P>
<P>
Despite the impact of the regional economic-monetary crisis,
the plenum agreed that, in enhancing the spirit of independence
and striving for further self-reliance, the party-state has
decided to concentrate its investment on agricultural production
and irrigation expansion.
</P>
<P>
The rice-growing area has been increased to 87,000 hectares in
the 1998-1999 dry season, a rise of 34,000 hectares over the
1997-1998 period. Farmers' incomes are on the rise. Development in
the industrial, communications and transport sectors is
continuing.
</P>
<P>
Attention has been paid to rural development, market management
and financial-monetary management. Accordingly, the growth of
the country's socio-economic basis is being continually ensured.
</P>
<P>
The plenary meeting examined in some depth defects,
shortcomings and other negative phenomena which may have arisen in
the process of implementation of the party-state line and
policies.
</P>
<P>
However, the plenum noted that Laos still faces
economic-financial difficulties. The impacts are felt strongly on
the whole system of national economy. The living conditions of
civil servants and low-income earners are in the doldrums, said
the plenum.
</P>
<P>
Under the circumstances, the plenum called for ensuring
political stability and social order, restoring the national
economy to normal as soon as possible, easing the low living
conditions of civil servants and people, and maintaining the
continual pace of the country's socio-economic development.
</P>
<P>
The participants discussed and made preliminary comments on
the drafting of strategies for a national socio-economic
development plan for the period up to year 2020.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto's Son-in-law Summoned by Armed Forces Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI)
Commander Gen. Wiranto has summoned Lt. Gen. (ret.) Prabowo
Subianto for a clarification of the meeting of May 14, 1998, ABRI
spokesman Maj. Gen. Syamsul Maarif told reporters here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Prabowo, son-in-law of former president Soeharto, was dismissed
from ABRI last year after a special military council found that
soldiers under his command in the Special Forces (Kopassus) had
kidnapped anti-Soeharto activists.
</P>
<P>
Once the fastest rising general in the military, Prabowo's star
tumbled after Soeharto quit on May 21 last year. He was sacked
from his position as chief of the Army's Strategic Reserves
(Kostrad) and transferred to a training college.
</P>
<P>
There was an indication that the May 14 meeting was associated
with the May 13-15 riots in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
A joint fact-finding team was established by the government to
investigate the riots in which 1,200 were killed, many of them
trapped in burning malls. The team has urged the government to
conduct further investigations into the riots, including the May
14 meeting.
</P>
<P>
The government has acknowledged that dozens of women were also
sexually assaulted, but it denied the team's conclusion that the
riots were organized.
</P>
<P>
According to Hashim Djojohadikusuma, Prabowo's younger brother,
Prabowo will soon return to Jakarta from Jordan.
</P>
<P>
"My brother Prabowo Subianto will arrive in Jakarta in April to
accept an invitation from General Wiranto, who has followed the
team's recommendation that Prabowo's presence at the meeting at
the Kostrad headquarters be clarified," Hashim said here Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> BSkyB Bid for Man United 'Kicked Out' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- BSkyB's takeover bid for
Manchester United has reportedly been turned down by the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC).
</P>
<P>
According to the Daily Telegraph newspaper on Wednesday,
sources close to the Department of Trade and Industry was quoted
as saying that the MMC had found that the satellite broadcaster's
625 million pounds agreed takeover bid was not in the public
interest.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the MMC questioned undertakings that BSkyB's
ownership of the Premiership football club would not give it an
unfair advantage when negotiating broadcasting rights to matches.
</P>
<P>
Trade and Industry Secretary Stephen Byers is expected to
decide by the middle of next month whether or not to accept the
MMC's recommendation.
</P>
<P>
The DTI declined to say what recommendation it had received
from the MMC.
</P>
<P>
"We do not comment on unpublished reports from the MMC," said a
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"They filed their report to the Secretary of State on the 12th
(of March). Mr. Byers will publish the report as soon as
practicable."
</P>
<P>
BSkyB, which is controlled by Rupert Murdoch, already has the
exclusive rights to the live screenings of English Premiership
football until 2001.
</P>
<P>
Last month the UK's commercial television regulator, the
Independent Television Commission (ITC), expressed reservations
about the proposed takeover.
</P>
<P>
Responding to newspaper reports that it had urged the MMC to
block the takeover, the ITC said any such deal would need to be
carefully investigated "to ensure that there will be effective
competition".
</P>
<P>
The proposed takeover has produced widespread opposition among
fans and small shareholders of Manchester United - the richest
club in football - and from other, smaller clubs.
</P>
<P>
They fear that the deal will lead to a reduction in the
revenues received by smaller clubs, and ultimately a European
super-league of top clubs that can only be viewed on a pay-per-
view basis.
</P>
<P>
Sports Minister Tony Banks and Football Taskforce head David
Mellor are among those who have expressed reservations about the
deal.
</P>
<P>
If the Manchester United bid does goes through, it looks set to
open the floodgates for the ownership of other football clubs by
broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
Newcastle United has already received a bid from cable operator
NTL, while until recently Arsenal was in talks with television
broadcaster Carlton.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment to Pakistan Drops to 222M Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Foreign direct investment (FDI)
to Pakistan dropped by 41.2 percent to 222.2 million U.S. dollars
in the first seven months of the current fiscal year starting from
July 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from the State Bank of Pakistan, the total
private investment inflow during the seven months amounted to
235.5 million dollars, which included portfolio investment of 13.3
million dollars, showing a dramatically decline of 56.5 percent
compared with the same months of last year.
</P>
<P>
During the corresponding period of last year, the total inflow
of private investment stood at 542.3 million dollars including
377.8 million dollars of FDI and 164.5 million dollars of
portfolio investment.
</P>
<P>
The United States and the United Kingdom remained the major
contributors of the FDI inflow in the first seven months of the
current year with 94.9 million dollars and 50 million dollars
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The other noted countries are Japan (21.1 million dollars),
Germany (17.5 million dollars), France (6.5 million dollars),
South Korea (4.6 million dollars) and the Netherlands (4.5 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, when compared with the corresponding period of last
year, except for Japan, Germany, South Korea and France, the
investment showed a considerable decline.
</P>
<P>
The major decline was witnessed in the inflows from the United
States as the FDI in the first seven months declined to 94.9
million dollars as against 169 million dollars in the same period
of last year.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Fiscal 1999 Budget Passed Despite Opposition in Upper House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government's annual
budget for fiscal 1999 was enacted intact Wednesday despite a
rejection by the opposition-controlled House of Councilors.
</P>
<P>
The budget bill was voted down by opposition parties in the
upper chamber earlier in the day, but it still became law as Japan'
s Constitution gives the House of Representatives supremacy over
the upper chamber in adopting a government budget.
</P>
<P>
The budget cleared the lower house on February 19, backed by
the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its coalition
partner Liberal Party (LP), which enjoy a majority in the lower
chamber.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's passage through the Diet (parliament) marks the
earliest date for a national budget to be enacted in Japan since
the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
The fiscal 1999 budget features expenditures worth 81.86
trillion yen (about 690.5 billion dollars), designed by the
Japanese government to help revitalize the slumping domestic
economy.
</P>
<P>
It is up 5.4 percent over the initial budget of the current
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
To fund this expansionary budget, the Japanese government has
to float a record 71.13 trillion yen (about 599.5 billion dollars)
worth of bonds, including refinancing bonds needed to redeem
outstanding bonds coming due during the year.

<HEADLINE> FAO Picks Philippines as Pilot Fishery Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The United Nation's Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) has chosen the Philippines as one
of the three countries to pilot-test a three-year fishery project
which is expected to further develop the country's marine
resources and help liberate small fishermen from poverty.
</P>
<P>
According to a report released by Agriculture Department
Secretary William Dar, the project, dubbed as the Forum for
Sustainable Fisheries (FSF), is geared at assisting developing
countries to better manage their fisheries and other oceanic
resources.
</P>
<P>
The project also aims to alleviate poverty, help local fishing
communities become self-sufficient, and secure the bounty and the
rich biodiversity of the sea for future generations.
</P>
<P>
The FSF, which will be implemented from next year to 2002, has
a three-year budget of 7.25 million U.S. dollars to be sourced
from foundations, other donors and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Of the total budget, some 640,000 dollars is set for pilot
operations in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The other countries eyed by the FAO as pilot FSF countries are
Guyana and Madagascar.

<P>
COLOMBO, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan government troops
Tuesday destroyed seven Tamil rebel bunkers in Northern Province
of the country, a military spokesman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ink Dewage said the troops observed a rebel stronghold and
destroyed seven rebel bunkers with the help of heavy machine guns
and rocket propelled grenades.
</P>
<P>
The rebels fired mortars and machine guns at the troops who
retaliated with artillery and mortar fire.
</P>
<P>
The troops confirmed that the rebels of the Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) suffered heavy casualties due to the
artillery fire, Dewage said.
</P>
<P>
Four soldiers were also injured during the fighting, he said.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, government troops conducted a limited
operation in the east and west of Paranthan in a bid to destroy
rebel strongholds in the areas simultaneously, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The troops destroyed a rebel bunker line. The rebels fired at
the advancing troops with small arms and then fled, while the
troops killed at least four of the fleeing rebels with artillery
and mortar fire.
</P>
<P>
Government troops also reportedly killed at least eight rebels
in two separate incidents in the same area on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been waging a war against the government since
1983 for a separate state of its own in the north and east of the

<HEADLINE> Thailand Wants to Become World Major Food Supplier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is taking steps to
become a major food producer for the world by year 2020, a senior
Thai government official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment would
double its efforts on scientific research, technological
development, energy exploitation and environmental protection to
achieve this goal, said Santhad Somchevita, permanent secretary
for the ministry.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference in commemoration of the ministry's
20th anniversary that the ministry realizes the significance of
turning to the development of scientific technology through
concrete research and development projects to increase the quality
of life of the Thai people, and enhance the country's economic
potential and competitiveness, especially in the food trade.
</P>
<P>
Projects for the development and improvement of food production
with a parallel significance given to the development of energy
and environmental protection were believed to be a practical
mechanism that would enable Thailand to achieve its goal of
becoming a major supplier of food to the world over the next 20
years, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the policy coincided with a move by authorities in
various agencies to promote Thailand as an exporter of
chemical-free farm products in the future by developing the
organic farming through transgenic techniques.
</P>
<P>
The techniques, aimed at reducing the use of chemical
substances in growing cash crops and plants, involve transferring
genetic material from one organism to another to create a new
strain with the desired characteristics, he said.
</P>
<P>
Scientists said transgenic techniques would lead to the faster
development of new strains at lower costs. They suggested that the
resulted products would be more uniform in quality that farmers
could be sure of successful crops and maximum output.

MAPUTO, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique's multi-party
elections, the second of its kind, is to be held on October 27-28,
with the registration planned from June 1 to August 15, Alfredo
Gamito, the Minister of State Administration, announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Gamito said that about 1930 registration teams are to be set
up for the year's elections, 200 more than that in the first
general elections in October 1994, the Noticias daily reported
here Wednesday .
</P>
<P>
He said that the money for the elections, which is about 40.8
million U. S. dollars, is ready, adding that nearly 21 percent of
the money, about nine million dollars will come from the
Mozambican government, with the rest coming from the European
Union (23 million) and the United Nations Development Program (8
million).
</P>
<P>
The minister said the government had completed all the work for
the election in early February, like the re-organization of the
secretariat of technical and administrative committee for the
election and the preparation of materials for its operation.
</P>
<P>
He urged the parliament and other parties to speed up the
process of the establishment of the National Election Committee,
one of the key issues for the elections.
</P>
<P>
A resolution passed by the Mozambican parliament stipulates
that the number of the election committee members should be
enlarged from nine to 17,

among which eight are to come from the ruling Mozambican
Liberation Front, six from the National Resistance Movement of
Mozambique, the biggest opposition party, and one from the
Democratic Union.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's exports of automobiles
and parts are expected to increase remarkably this year as local
creditors rebuild confidence and begin to extend new loans to the
industry, the Thai News Agency (TNA) Wednesday quoted a top
businessman as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ninnanart Chaithiraphinyo, chairman of the Automobile Industry
Group of the Federation of Thai Industries, said that exports of
cars, motorcycles and parts were believed to reach 150,000 units,
worth 100 billion baht (2.7 billion U.S. dollars) this year.
</P>
<P>
The figure will more than double last year's volume of 66,788
units worth 44 billion baht (1.2 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The change coincided with a positive move by local creditors
which began offering new loans to automobile and parts firms due
to improved export prospects of the industry, Ninnanart said.
</P>
<P>
Creditors are regaining their confidence that lendings to the
industry would not turn to be non-performing loan, he added.
</P>
<P>
Domestic automobile sale was also expected to rise to
160,000-180,000 units this year, an increase of 10 to 20 percent
over last year, he predicted.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Reduces School Enrolment in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African Unity
(OAU) says the spread of HIV/AIDS has lowered the return of
investment in the educational sector in Africa.
</P>
<P>
An OAU document entitled "HIV/AIDS and Education: One Affecting
the Other" prepared for the conference of African ministers of
education taking pace in Harare, capital of Zimbabwe, said African
governments should, therefore, work toward minimizing the spread
of the infection.
</P>
<P>
"In many places children born with HIV/AIDS have not lived to
enroll in schools or those who enrolled dropped out due to health
problems or taking care of sick relatives," said the document,
which is available here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It said the infection had brought economic hardships to many
African families making them unable to send children to school.
</P>
<P>
"The spread of HIV/AIDS has brought economic difficulties to
families, and this has negative impact on the demand for
education," it said.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. AIDS report for 1996 estimated that the number of people
infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, had increased from
10 million in 1990 to about 25.5 million.
</P>
<P>
In Africa it was estimated that by the year 2000 about 20
million people would be HIV positive, causing approximately one
million deaths annually.
</P>
<P>
The document recommended that schools alter the content and
methods of teaching to include knowledge about sexuality, the
transmission and prevention of the infection and skills to cope
with its impact on schools.

<HEADLINE> Manila Creates Task Force to Monitor Plastics Importation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada has formed a seven-member task force to monitor and
regulate the importation of petrochemical and plastics products as
a way to protect the country's fledging petrochemical and plastics
industries from unfair trade practices like dumping and outright
smuggling.
</P>
<P>
An administrative order said the task force was empowered to
withhold the issuance of Importation Clearance (IC) if there is
basis to believe that the shipment has been tainted with any
unfair trade practice.
</P>
<P>
The president also vested the task force with the power to seek
the assistance of the Department of Justice and the Philippine
National Police in the apprehension and prosecution of elements
involved in the smuggling of petrochemical and plastics products.
</P>
<P>
"The government is determined to ensure the survival and
continued growth of the country's newly-established petrochemical
and plastics industries and to see to it that the same is placed
in a level playing field vis-a-vis its foreign counterparts,"
Estrada said in the administrative order.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is aware that during times of economic
crisis, there exist rampant unfair trade practices involving
dumping, underevaluation, misclassification and outright smuggling
of petrochemical and plastics products.
</P>
<P>
Estrada also cited the need to protect the government's
flagship projects like the petrochemical and plastics industry in
view of its critical role in pump priming the national economy,
generating jobs, and reducing the country's reliance on foreign
exchange.
</P>
<P>
The head of the task force shall have a term of one year.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Ships Turn Into Money-Makers' Target in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unlike the gunmen in southern Somalia who are busy in fighting
for clan motivations or extorting money from the commercial
traffic at roadblocks, the gunmen in northeastern somalia
construct heavy machine guns on speed boats with the aim of
improving their capacity in hunting for foreign fishing vessels.
</P>
<P>
The latest of such activities indicate that a Taiwanese fishing
boat was caught by Somali gunmen at Dhananeh beach of Eyl
district in the northeastern region of Nugal Monday afternoon .
</P>
<P>
According to the reports reaching here in Mogadishu, the
vessel was attacked by four speed boats with more than 30 heavily
armed men on board.
</P>
<P>
The reports did not say whether the Taiwanese vessel was
itself armed. But the VHF radio reports from the town of Eyl said
one of the speed boats which attacked the vessel together with
six of its staff members are still missing despite the victory of
conquering the fishing vessel.
</P>
<P>
Unlike other times, the gunmen who had captured the vessel
have refused access of anybody to see the foreigners on board the
vessel and their status.
</P>
<P>
However, some inner sources said the vessel is carrying 31
foreigners on board including Ugandans, Tanzanians, Indians and
other nationals. The gunmen holding the vessel and its crew
members said the foreign vessel was caught red-handed in fishing
illegally in the sea waters of northeastern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The vessel is not the only one caught in recent days. Three
days ago, another foreign fishing vessel belonging to Ukraine was
similarly caught in Gabba coast of Eyl district in Mudug region.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the vessel having 19 crew members on
board, 18 Ukrainians and a Somali national, was caught while
allegedly conducting illegal fishing activities in Somalia's
economic exclusive sea waters in the Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
On February 18, an Italian ship with its 33 crew members were
released with a ransom of 230,000 U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Set Up Bank to Support Informal Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa has directed the establishment of the Dar es
Salaam Community Bank to provide micro-finance credit facilities
to the informal sector.
</P>
<P>
Launching the Dar es Salaam Informal Sector Development Program
(1999- 2003) Tuesday, Mkapa said that the informal sector
development can reduce unemployment, eradicate poverty and cut
down the crime rate.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers Wednesday quoted the Dar es Salaam City
Commission (DCC) Chairman Charles Keenja as saying that his
commission will this year provide more than 900 million shillings
(one U.S. dollar equals 692 Tanzanian shillings at present) worth
soft loans to the sector.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa gave the directive when he was on a one-day inspection
tour of the informal sector in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
"The government is now giving a special emphasis on individuals
and groups who employ themselves or form co-operative unions and
initiate credit and savings schemes," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president disclosed that the launching of the informal
sector development program was the government's long-term plan in
transition to transform the informal sector into the formal
sector.
</P>
<P>
He directed authorities concerned to reduce unnecessary
bureaucracy which block the access to loan applicants.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mkapa also warned the informal sector that they
should cultivate a habit of repaying loans and keep away from
hiring child labors. The DCC recovered only 14 percent of the
total loans disbursed to Dar es Salaam residents in the 1997/98
financial year, he concluded

<HEADLINE> Burundi Peace Committees Proceed Slowly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Four committees for the
Burundi peace talks ended their 10-day meeting Tuesday in
Tanzanian northern town of Arusha with some but slow progress.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers Wednesday quoted sources close to the talks as
saying another round of meeting is needed in May before the
decisive plenary session in June.
</P>
<P>
Concluding the meeting, the international peace facilitator,
Tanzanian founding president Julius Nyerere, urged the committees
to iron out their differences toward a lasting peace for the
war-torn central African nation.
</P>
<P>
Delegates to the closed-door talks said that the committees
have started more in-depth discussions between warring parties,
but progress is slow especially on the issues of peace and
democracy.
</P>
<P>
Nicholas Haysom, the South African president of the democracy
committee, said that his committee has completed preliminary
discussions on a 36- issue agenda, but some most difficult issues
remained unsolved.
</P>
<P>
He said the problems were related to an electoral system, the
composition of the legislature, local government and institutions.
</P>
<P>
Haysom said it was likely that another set of committee
negotiations will be organized in Arusha ahead of the June
deadline, but he believed Burundi nationals are expecting to
"sort out the problem by the end of the year".
</P>
<P>
On January 23, the Great Lakes Region countries suspended the
economic sanctions, imposed on Burundi since July 1996 when
former Burundi president Pierre Buyoya took power following a
military coup. They aimed to encourage the progress achieved in
the four round talks which started last June.

a great deal of experience to exchange in the field of
administrative control.

political and economic situation, as well as the country's
administrative supervision operations.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAUSANNE, March 17 (Xinhua) -- International Olympic Committee
president Juan Antonio Samaranch said on Wednesday the IOC "is now
on trial" and must take quick action to avoid "very, very serious"
damage.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech to the general assembly, Samaranch said
he accepted responsibility for the development of a "crisis of
this magnitude" and that the IOC should take the blame "even if
some of the conduct by bidding cities has itself been unethical."
</P>
<P>
"It is the IOC that is being judged, and the IOC that must deal
with the situation," he said. "Bidding cities which may have acted
improperly are a matter of the past; it is our IOC which is now on
trial."
</P>
<P>
He said the committee "must root out all forms of inappropriate
or unethical behavior among our membership" and called on the
delegates to uphold expulsions of six members who were found
guilty in the Salt Lake bribery scandal.
</P>
<P>
"It is my firm conviction that, unless we act quickly,
decisively and unanimously ... the damage which may be done to the
Olympic movement and to the IOC as a result of recent disclosures
will be very, very serious," Samaranch said.
</P>
<P>
The speech was followed by an overwhelming vote of confidence
for the 78-year-old Spaniard. The secret ballot was 86-2 in fovor
of Samaranch, with one blank ballot and another not returned.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Faces Maize Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 17 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is faced with a
massive shortage of maize, one of the staple food in the country,
this year as scorching heat and low rainfall ruined huge areas of
crops, The Star paper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Maize output is now expected to reach 5.81 million tons instead
of the 7. 26 million forecast two weeks ago, the National Maize
Producers' Organization (NAMPO) said.
</P>
<P>
Low yields were also expected in other crops due to unusual
weather since mid-February.
</P>
<P>
Some farmers in the maize-growing areas had indicated that
their crops were up to 30 percent below expectations, NAMPO
president Japie Grobler said.
</P>
<P>
Once the season was over there would be an estimated shortage
of one million tons, he said.
</P>
<P>
As a low harvest was also expected for other regional
countries, South Africa would have to fulfil its commitments of
feeding them, which would aggravate the situation.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Establish Three Border Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria is to establish three
border markets with Niger, Cameroun and Chad to boost exports and
enhance business relations with its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The three proposed markets are to be set up this year by the
Borno State, northeastern Nigeria, bordering these countries,
according to a Business Guardian report Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Borno State Administrator Group Captain Lawan Ningi Haruna was
quoted as saying at the recently concluded Kaduna trade fair that
the establishment of border markets is a strategy to boost
socio-economic activities along the border towns.
</P>
<P>
He noted that manufacturers and industrialists of the four
countries will use the markets as a common ground to exchange
their goods and services.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, he added, the rate of smuggling along the border
will also be reduced when the products and services are available
at market prices.
</P>
<P>
This is one of the major objectives of the government to set up
border markets, the administrator stated.
</P>
<P>
The idea of establishing border markets to formalize Nigeria's
exports with its neighbors was advocated by the then President of
the Association of Nigerian Exporters, late Chief Grace Ogunlusi,
in late 1980s.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Call for Arab Support over Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinians Wednesday called
on the Arab countries to provide political and financial support
for the issue of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Egypt's Voice of Arab radio, Palestinian
Minister for Jerusalem Affairs Faisal Husseini urged Arab foreign
ministers to seek ways of protecting Jerusalem against Israel's
move of judaization.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministers Council of the Arab League opened the
111th session here in the day. The ministers are expected to
discuss, among other things, the issue of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Husseini lauded the stance of the European Union (EU) on
Jerusalem, stressing the need for the EU and its member states to
play a key role in the Middle East peace process, the Cairo-based
radio said.
</P>
<P>
The EU maintains that Jerusalem is part of the occupied
territories, disagreeing to Israel's proclamation that the holy
city is its "undivided and eternal capital."
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied the traditionally Arab East Jerusalem in the
1967 Mideast War and its parliament later passed a bill, claiming
that the city, holy to Muslims, Christians and Jews, is Israel's
capital.
</P>
<P>
Husseini lashed out at Israel's threats over the possible
declaration of a Palestinian state, noting that peace is in the
interests of both the Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have said they will declare an independent
state on May 4 when the five-year Palestinian interim self-rule
enshrined in the 1993 Oslo Accord expires regardless of the
results of the peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel has threatened to take tough measures against the step,
including annexation of parts of the West Bank under its control.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Right-Wing Party Leader Convicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Aryeh Deri, leader of Israel's
powerful right-wing Shas Party, Wednesday was convicted of
bribe-taking by Jerusalem District Court.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution charged that Deri took about 167,000 U.S.
dollars in bribes in return for using his senior position in the
Interior Ministry to provide some organizations with special
treatment and government funding.
</P>
<P>
Judge Yaakov Tzemach announced the verdicts on Wednesday
morning before reading a 917-page decision.
</P>
<P>
Deri, a close associate of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
was also convicted of fraud and breaching the public trust.
</P>
<P>
Although Deri was acquitted on some other charges against him,
the bribery conviction would carry a maximum sentence of seven
years imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
It is still not clear when the sentencing will take place.
</P>
<P>
According to Israel's law, Deri will be legally barred from
serving as a cabinet minister for 10 years from the day he
finishes serving his sentence.
</P>
<P>
Shas Party, which currently has 10 seats in the 120-member
Knesset (parliament), is made up of Jews with Middle Eastern
origin.
</P>
<P>
Since it is only less than two months before the general
elections of Israel, Deri's conviction is likely to raise
tensions in the country.
</P>
<P>
Some followers of Shas regarded the conviction as a ruling
against the whole party and threatened to hold mass
demonstration.
</P>
<P>
However, local political analysts said that the verdict could
rally Shas supporters to the polls and help the right-wing
Netanyahu in the elections.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli police has been bracing for the verdict's
announcement, by assigning a bodyguard to each of the three
Jerusalem District Court judges who presided over the case, and
reinforcing security around the court.
</P>
<P>
Police said the judges received death threats several times
over the last few days.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Suffers Big Defeat: Eritrean Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ASMARA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian army had suffered
the biggest defeat in the Tsorona front since the outbreak of the
conflict between the two Horn of Africa neighbors, the Eritrean
Foreign Ministry said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a statement that Eritrea destroyed a total
of 57 Ethiopian tanks, captured six others and shot down one
Mig-23 jet fighter in the three-day fierce fighting at the Tsorona
flank of the Alitiena-Mereb front.
</P>
<P>
The fighting died down at about 9:00 a.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia denied the downing of the Mig-fighter, although one
senior Eritrean foreign ministry official said that the plane
crashed in the Ethiopian side.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean statement said that Ethiopia had lost about 9,000
troops in the battles which raged from February 23 to 26 in the
Mereb-Setit front.
</P>
<P>
It noted that "their losses in the Tsorona front in the past
three days were several fold higher."
</P>
<P>
The statement pointed out that the Ethiopian forces bombed the
small town of Kinafina in central-south Eritrea Tuesday, severely
wounding eight people.
</P>
<P>
It added that in the previous weeks, Ethiopia bombed the
civilian centers of Deda Lailai, Shambuqo, Adi Quala and a cluster
of villages in the Zalambesa area.
</P>
<P>
No fighting was reported Tuesday and Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> FIFA Warns Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- FIFA, the world soccer governing
body, has warned the Zambian government not to take any action
that might be in variance with the FIFA Statutes as it seek to
resolve the standoff with the Football Association of Zambia (FAZ)
executive, the Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper quoted FIFA as saying that it has given the
government and the FAZ enough time to find an amicable solution to
the 11-month standoff but no meaningful progress has been made.
</P>
<P>
FIFA accused the government of gross interference in the
running of the sport and said that Zambia's soccer will collapse
if FAZ does not receive any grants from the government, according
to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Following Zambia's poor performance at the Africa Cup finals in
Burkina Faso in February of 1998, the FAZ executive was removed on
the charge of misapplication of more than 500 million Kwacha (over
200,000 U.S. dollars) the government released for the campaign.
</P>
<P>
FIFA, reacting to what it saw as government interference in the
running of soccer, was on the verge of banning Zambia from
international soccer activities when the government reluctantly
restored in office the FAZ executive led by Teddy Mulonga.
</P>
<P>
Later the government allowed Mulonga and his team back in
office but it imposed a financial squeeze on the association in a
bid to force the current executives out.
</P>
<P>
The estrangement of the FAZ executive has cast a shadow on the
future of Zambian soccer given the fact the association is
dependent on the government financial support to fulfill its
various international engagements.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Federation Council
Wednesday rejected Yuri Skuratov's request for resignation from
the office of Prosecutor General.
</P>
<P>
The upper house of parliament rejected the resignation by a
vote of 142-6 with three abstentions at a session attended by
Skuratov.
</P>
<P>
Skuratov, who tendered his resignation in early February, said
Wednesday that he is prepared to continue working at the post.
</P>
<P>
"I will not give up the work, if you extend your trust and
support to me," Skuratov said.
</P>
<P>
Skuratov confirmed the existence of reported compromising
material against him but insisted he had not "done anything in
breach of the law," Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Skuratov's resignation, presumably for "health reasons," was
announced by the Kremlin on February 2.
</P>
<P>
President Boris Yeltsin accepted the resignation right away
and sent a letter to the Federation Council, asking them to free
Skuratov from his duties immediately.
</P>
<P>
Under the Russian Constitution, the prosecutor general is
appointed and dismissed by the Federation Council on the
initiative of the president.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear what Yeltsin would do in the wake of
Wednesday's Federation Council rejection.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma, or lower house of parliament, hailed the upper
house vote.
</P>
<P>
"Thus, the Prosecutor General remains in office," Duma Speaker
Gennady Seleznyov said.

</P>
<P>
An official welcoming ceremony was held by his Vietnamese

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Opposes Total Ban on Use of Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is not considering
signing the Ottawa Convention which slaps a total ban on the use
of mines because doing so would be against its vital security
requirements, Pakistani Foreign Office sources said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan's peculiar security requirements do not permit
accepting a ban on the use of land mines as stipulated under the
Ottawa Convention," the Associated Press of Pakistan quoted the
sources as saying here.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan cannot sign the Ottawa Convention which totally bans
the use of land mines "unless and until a viable alternative to
land mines is available," said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Russia and India have also refused to sign
the convention for their own respective security reasons, the
sources noted.
</P>
<P>
However, the sources said Pakistan has all along been observing
high standards of regulating the use of mines keeping in view the
humanitarian concern on the use of land mines.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has already banned the export of anti-personnel land
mines in pursuance of its unilateral moratorium since March 1997
on export of land mines.
</P>
<P>
It accepts the provisions of the amended Protocol II of the
Certain Conventional Weapons Convention which it ratified on March
9 this year.
</P>
<P>
Drawing the distinction between the Ottawa Convention and the
amended Protocol II, the sources said the latter doesn't impose a
ban on the use of land mines but regulates their use.
</P>
<P>
The amended Protocol II calls for elimination by 2007 of all
"dumb" land mines which are without detectable, self-destruction
and self-deactivation mechanism.
</P>
<P>
The formal acceptance by Pakistan of the amended Protocol II
reflects its firm commitment towards the humanitarian cause of
sparing innocent civilians of the scourge of anti-personnel mines,
said the sources.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Announces Initiatives for Asset Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Monetary Authority of
Singapore (MAS) Wednesday announced new initiatives to attract
asset managers to use the city state as a regional center to
manage their Asian mandates as well as some global mandates.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the second annual conference of the Investment
Management Association of Singapore (IMAS), MAS Managing Director
Koh Yong Guan said MAS will this year focus on attracting
reputable foreign intermediaries in fixed income activities,
strengthening the local industry particularly by promoting
boutique fund managers and building up the skills pool in the
industry.
</P>
<P>
Koh said a key component of Singapore's strategy to develop the
debt capital market is to attract reputable global fixed income
trading and arrange teams to base their Asian operations in
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
This will give asset managers a wide range of debt instruments
to invest in, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also said asset managers should leverage on Singapore's
strength in foreign exchange and treasury operations and clients
who want to reduce portfolio risk through currency hedging or seek
enhanced returns through dynamic trading of currency exposures
will find such services attractive.
</P>
<P>
On strengthening the local industry, Koh said MAS will
introduce a streamlined licensing scheme with appropriate
incentives aimed at developing more boutique fund management firms
or BFMs.
</P>
<P>
These smaller firms owned and operated by experienced
professionals provide specialized investment and advisory services
to selected institutional and high net-worth individual clients,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that there are currently about a dozen BFMs in
Singapore, Koh said licensing them as investment advisers or IAs
will improve their ability to reach out to a wider client base.
</P>
<P>
He listed seven items of requirements for BFMs to qualify as
IAs and underlined that MAS has softened most of the terms.
</P>
<P>
MAS is also prepared to consider licensing foreign-owned BFMs
on a case-by-case basis if they have operated in Singapore either
as an approved fund manager or exempt IA for at least three years,
Koh added.
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing that the most critical success factor for
developing the asset management industry will be the ability to
build a broad and deep talent pool, Koh said MAS will exert itself
to ensure there is a ready supply of talents who have strong
academic qualifications in related disciplines and professional
qualifications like the Chartered Financial Analysts.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian PM Ends Visit to Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen
Wednesday ended his three-day visit to Indonesia after visiting
Bogor Palace in southern Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
During a brief tour of Bogor Palace, which was once a meeting
place for Cambodian warring factions in the Jakarta Informal
Meeting, Hun Sen held an informal meeting with President B.J.
Habibie.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, State Secretary/Minister Akbar Tanjung said
Cambodia has asked the Indonesian Police (Polri) to help train
their own law enforcement personnel especially to anticipate
riots, because Polri has succeeded in handling riots in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"The training program could be held here (in Indonesia) or
there (in Cambodia). But it will be better if it is carried out
here," Antara News Agency quoted Akbar as saying.
</P>
<P>
Apart from trainers, Polri will also provide a budget for the
training program, Akbar added.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen arrived here on Monday on a mission to strengthen ties
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
During the talks between Habibie and Hun Sen on Tuesday, the
two agreed to improve economic cooperation, particularly in
tobacco trade, rubber planting and oil and gas exploration.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Right-Wing Party Leader Convicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Aryeh Deri, leader of Israel's
powerful right-wing Shas Party, Wednesday was convicted of
bribe-taking by Jerusalem District Court.
</P>
<P>
Deri, a close associate of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
was also convicted of fraud and breaching public trust.
</P>
<P>
Judge Yaakov Tzemach announced the verdicts before reading a
917-page decision.
</P>
<P>
Although Deri was also acquitted on some other charges against
him, the bribery conviction would carry a maximum sentence of
seven year imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
It is still not clear when the sentencing will take place.
</P>
<P>
The Shas Party, which currently has 10 seats in the 120-member
Knesset (parliament), is made up of Jews with Middle Eastern
origin.
</P>
<P>
Since it is only less than two months before the general
elections of Israel, Deri's conviction is likely to raise
tensions in the country.
</P>
<P>
Some followers of Shas regarded the conviction as a ruling
against the whole party and threatened to hold mass
demonstration.

<P>
PARIS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The resignation of the European Commission has come as a
relief for all European Union countries, which are now seeking new
heads of the executive body of the union. While the European
Parliament wishes a rapid departure of the commissioners, some of
them are trying to hang on before the expiration of their term.
</P>
<P>
-- While the talks on Kosovo were still going on in Paris,
clashes multiplied in the field between the Yugoslav forces and
Albanian separatist force the KLA. In reprisal against the
ambushes by the KLA, the Serbs are razing to the ground Albanian
villages each day.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- While people in every European capitals are measuring the
the consequences from the crisis at the executive body of the
European Union, the Commissioners have reacted with bitterness and
anger to the report by the committee of five independent experts
on frauds, describing as ``shameful'' the hard terms used on the
basis of a few cases of irregularities.
</P>
<P>
-- One step forward, two steps backward. The talks on Kosovo
are once again blocked after the Serbs reiterated their refusal to
sign the peace agreement on Tuesday. Visibly taken by surprise by
the decision of Albanians to accept the peace agreement, the Serbs
maintained their rejection of the military wing of the agreement
and even wanted to modify the political part of the agreement.

<HEADLINE> Another Iraqi Plane Breaks Air Ban, Carries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Another Iraqi plane carrying 111
elderly pilgrims on Wednesday morning took off from Baghdad
heading for the holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia, where pilgrims
will perform rituals of hadj.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, an Iraqi plane carrying 110 elderly pilgrims also
took off from Baghdad for Mecca.
</P>
<P>
This is the third time that Iraq broke the United Nations air
ban imposed on the country after the 1991 Gulf War. In 1997, an
Iraqi plane carrying Iraq's elderly pilgrims flew to Jeddah
airport in southwestern Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, nearly 2,000 Iraqi pilgrims left for Saudi Arabia
for the hadj by buses, the first group from Iraq to perform the
annual Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca this year. On Tuesday, another
2,000 pilgrims left Baghdad for Mecca by buses.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, with a population of over 22 million, can send up to
22,000 pilgrims to Mecca under quotas set by the Organization of
the Islamic Conference.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions, which have impoverished most ordinary
Iraqis, have made it impossible for all but the wealthiest to
afford the pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi Foreign Ministry on Sunday accused United States and
British representatives in the U.N. Sanctions Committee of
impeding efforts to try to help Iraqis perform their pilgrimage
by rejecting the Iraqi proposal for using its frozen assets in
foreign countries to finance its pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, 3,000 Iraqi pilgrims made the trip to Mecca to
perform hadj. In 1997, Iraq flew a planeload of pilgrims to
Mecca, other pilgrims were flown by helicopters to the
Iraqi-Saudi border despite a ban on flights over Iraq enforced by
the U.S. and Britain.

MANILA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- A hostage taker captured after
killing three people and wounding a housewife early Wednesday
morning was subjected to medical examination prior to the filing
of criminal charges against him.
</P>
<P>
Alfonso Bayot, just on his third day in Manila, slew the
victims with a bolo and a lead pipe and held three children

</P>
<P>
The bloody hostage-taking incident took place at a two-storeyed
house. Three people, including a woman, were slain by the man.
</P>
<P>
A housewife sustained severe injuries and was in critical
condition at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
The suspect, investigators said, arrived in Manila with one of
the victims from Davao del Sur to work as houseboys under the
auspices of an employment agency.
</P>

But the two sneaked and went to the house of Eduardo Manggay,
another victim.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Welcomes U.S.-DPRK Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 17 (Xinhua) -- South Korea Wednesday welcomed the
agreement signed between Washington and Pyongyang Tuesday in New
York which allows U.S. access to suspected underground nuclear
facilities in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
The government of the Republic of Korea "welcomes" the "
desirable settlement" reached at the fourth round of the U.S.-DPRK
negotiations over Kumchang-ni underground construction held from
February 27 to march 15, said the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and
Trade.
</P>
<P>
South Korea expects the DPRK to fully comply with the agreement,
thereby completely dispelling suspicion over Kumchang-ni site, It
said.
</P>
<P>
The nation also hopes the DPRK will leave no grounds for other
nuclear-related suspicions in the future by faithfully sticking
to various international norms and agreements, such as the "Joint
Declaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", "Non-
Proliferation Treaty", "IAEA Safeguards Agreement" and "1994
Framework Agreement," it said.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement the DPRK will allow U.S. access to its
nuclear-suspected underground site in May this year and next year
and guarantees further access when necessary, while the United
States will supply the DPRK seeds, fertilizers and agricultural
technology.
</P>
<P>
The suspected nuclear Kumchang-ni site first became a focus of
international press last August after U.S. satellite photos linked
it to secret nuclear facilities.

<HEADLINE> Russia Wants Better Economic Ties with U.S., Says Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov has called for better economic relations with the United
States, the Itar-Tass news agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral economic ties "are undoubtedly changing for the
better, but they are changing too slowly," Primakov said prior to
a visit to Washington to attend the session of the Russia-U.S.
economic cooperation commission on March 23-25.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States is among Russia's three largest
trading partners and trade turnover has been growing in the past
few years but the growth was not fast enough.
</P>
<P>
"What's 9 billion dollars a year compared with 1 billion
dollars per day in the U.S.-Canadian trade? What's 5 billion
dollars of U.S. investments in Russia compared with dozens,
perhaps hundreds of billions of dollars of U.S. investments in
China?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
"The present parameters of our economic relations are
unquestionably improving, but too slowly. We are facing hard and
painstaking work to strengthen the economic basis of the Russian-U.
S. partnership which looks into the 21st century," Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said during the upcoming U.S. visit, he
would try to re-orient the commission's work "to provide real
assistance to the solution of the problems faced by Russia."
</P>
<P>
Specifically, he would urge the Americans to drop anti-dumping
investigation into Russia's rolled steel exports, to expand the
quota for commercial space launched by Russian booster rockets and
to lift other discriminating and restrictive measures against
Russia.
</P>
<P>
"We also intend to thoroughly discuss with Americans possible
ways to boost contacts as regards small business, cooperation in
telecommunications and commercialization of technologies and
interaction in implementing a regional investment initiative,"
Primakov said.

<HEADLINE> Most Israelis See PNA Genuine Peace Partner: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Most Israelis now believe the
Palestinian leadership is sincere in making peace with Israel,
while few of the Palestinians give much credit to the Israeli
government, a recent joint Israeli-Palestinian poll shows.
</P>
<P>
Also according to the poll, released here Wednesday, the two
peoples are divergent over the future of Jerusalem along a
clear-cut national line.
</P>
<P>
The poll results were submitted by Tel Aviv University's Tami
Sterinmetz Center for Peace (TSCP) and the Jerusalem Media and
Communication Center (JMCC) after querying 500 Israelis and 500
Palestinians respectively.
</P>
<P>
Some 41.7 percent of the Israelis interviewed think the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) is "genuine" in making peace
with Israel, anther 19.8 percent answered it's "very genuine."
</P>
<P>
By comparison with a 1997 poll on the same question, the
PNA's credibility is on the rise among the Israelis despite the
Israeli government's allegations of Palestinian non-compliance
with peace deals.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 poll showed 14.4 percent of the Israelis thought the
PNA to be "very genuine" while 37.9 percent found it "genuine."
</P>
<P>
Tamar Hermann, director of the TSCP, attributed the growing
confidence in the PNA to a sustained period without terrorist
attacks inside the Green Line, or Cease-fire Line of the 1967
Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
It has to do with an increased sense of personal security and
the Israelis gave the PNA credit for curbing terrorist attacks,
Tamar said.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians, by contrast, overwhelmingly distrust the
intentions of the Israeli government towards the peace process,
according to the poll.
</P>
<P>
Some 52.5 percent of the Palestinians termed its intentions
"not genuine at all," while 36.3 percent described it "not
genuine."
</P>
<P>
The poll also showed that most Israelis believe the post-Oslo
peace process will result in the establishment of a "genuinely
independent Palestinian state," with 33.5 percent saying this will
"surely happen" while 39.6 percent believe it will "probably
happen."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 64.7 percent of the Israeli respondents disagree
with the establishment of a Palestinian state comprising the West
Bank and Gaza Strip and with East Jerusalem as its capital, with
only 17.4 percent supporting this idea, 12.9 percent observing
neutrality and 5 percent saying they don't known.
</P>
<P>
However, 91.3 percent of the Palestinian respondents said no to
accepting Jerusalem as the "unified capital of Israel" as a
bargain to break a final deadlock in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The poll was sponsored by the People to People program, a
Norwegian effort to promote Israeli-Palestinian contact as part
of the Oslo Accords signed in 1993.

that prompted the resignation of the whole Brussels executive.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Urges U.S. to Normalize Ties with DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 17 (Xinhua) -- South Korea Wednesday urged the
United States to normalize relations with the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) to help facilitate Seoul's comprehensive
engagement policy toward the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that normalization of relations between the United
States and North Korea will take place because it means a wider
opening up of North Korea to the world community," said South
Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade Hong Soon-young at
the Seoul Foreign Correspondents' Club.
</P>
<P>
He said the establishment of full diplomatic relationship
between the United States and the DPRK will help improve inter-
Korean relations and foster an atmosphere for peaceful co-
existence in the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister said official ties between Washington and
Pyongyang will be in line with the comprehensive engagement
strategy put forward by South Korean President Kim Dae-jung.
</P>
<P>
The minister's statement came soon after the DPRK and the
United States reached an agreement in New York Tuesday over
suspected underground nuclear site in DPRK's Kumchang-ni.
</P>
<P>
In the agreement, the DPRK promises to allow the United States
access to the suspected nuclear site while the latter pledges to
improve bilateral political and economic relations.

<HEADLINE> China's Auto Industry Growth to Slow Down: Analysts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- China's auto industry will
continue to grow this year, but at a much lower speed, according
to today's China Consumer Journal.
</P>
<P>
Demand for automobiles will be further diversified and the
industry will see fiercer competition this year, local analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate of the industry will be lower than that of the
GDP this year, as it was in 1998, they said.
</P>
<P>
Some 1.63 million automobiles were manufactured in China last
year, up 2.44 percent on an annual basis, as compared with the 7.8
percent growth of GDP.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute the slowdown to a weak domestic market and
restrictions imposed on individual car buyers in some regions.
They pointed out that many flood-hit provinces have listed
reconstruction as their top priority, crowding out potential car
purchases.
</P>
<P>
Expensive cars and limousines, which have accounted for half of
all auto sales in the past, will undergo a decline in demand as
the government is reducing the number of cars for official
purposes.
</P>
<P>
Sales of private cars are expected to grow by 10 percent, but
this growth rate is subject to changes in related policies and the
income of potential buyers, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
However, more buses and trucks are expected to be sold as huge
investments in infrastructure construction are taking effect. In
any case, the market share of trucks and buses is too small to
exert a significant influence on the auto industry overall.

<HEADLINE> Rebel Captive Asks Philippine Govt to Resume Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- For the first time since his
abduction by New People's Army rebels on February 21, Police Chief
Insp. Roberto Bernal's voice was aired over the airlanes in
Legazpi City and Sorsogon province Wednesday morning, press
reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Bernal appealed foremost to his family and supporters not to
worry about his condition in the hands of his abductors and urged
President Joseph Estrada to resume peace talks and suspend
military operations in Bicol.
</P>
<P>
These were bared in a voice tape furnished by the
Sorsogon-based DZMS radio station and was aired simulcast over its
sister company DZGB-AM in Legazpi City.
</P>
<P>
The tape confirmed Bernal is still alive, quashing earlier
reports that he was already executed by his captors.
</P>
<P>
In the voice tape, Chief Supt. Bernal confirmed he was safe and
taken cared of by his captors in consonance with the Comprehensive
Agreement on Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law
(CAHRIHL).
</P>
<P>
Bernal advised his family not to worry about him. "This won't
be long," he said, dismissing his family' fear for his life in the
hands of his takers.
</P>
<P>
He also thanked his comrades and the Armed Forces for the
relentless drive to rescue him, but appealed for the immediate
suspension of military operations, saying it would put in danger
the lives and property of civilians, and himself as well.
</P>
<P>
"Please do not employ drastic actions but go back to the
negotiating table with the National Democratic Front (NDF)," he
said, addressing President Estrada and police and military
officials.
</P>
<P>
Chief Supt. Marcelo Navarro, Bicol police director, said he was
willing to make coordinations for the suspension of military
operations once the rebels proved their sincerity by releasing
Bernal unharmed.

<HEADLINE> Coles Leaves "Dead Cat" on Table at SOCOG </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The refusal of Australia's
International Olympic Committee (IOC) member Phil Coles to step
down from the Sydney Olympics organizing board had left SOCOG with
"a dead cat on the table," a fellow board member said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ron Phillips, the New South Wales state opposition spokesman on
the Olympics, joined several board members in urging Coles to quit
from his role with the 2000 Games.
</P>
<P>
Coles has been investigated by the IOC for accepting bribery
from Salt Lake City during its bid to host the 2002 Winter
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Coles, 67, quit his position in the Australian Olympic
Committee last week citing health reasons. But he cannot be
sacked from the SOCOG board as the its contract with the IOC
stipulates that all Australian IOC members should be on the board.
</P>
<P>
"A dead cat has landed on the table of the SOCOG board and the
problem is going to remain while Phil Coles hangs around,"
Phillips said. "There is no doubt the feeling is that Phil Coles
remaining on the board diminishes the standing of SOCOG and the
Sydney Olympics in the eyes of the community."

general of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
(ARATS), and his party arrived in Taipei this afternoon to
exchange views with the Straits Exchanges Foundation (SEF) on
ARATS President Wang Daohan's Taiwan visit.
</P>

economy, exchange high-level visits, and increase mutual
assistance in cases involving the life and property of compatriots
on both sides of the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, it was also agreed that Wang Daohan will

Li stressed that the Wang-Koo meeting has created a positive
atmosphere for cross-Straits relations, which must be cherished by
both sides.

make certain that Wang's Taiwan visit further promote the
development of cross-Straits relations and meet the desires and
demands of compatriots on both sides.

<HEADLINE> Man Arrested for Alleged Defamation of Zambian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- A man was arrested by Zambian
police here Tuesday weeks after he claimed that Zambian President
Frederick Chiluba had paid him to assassinate a opposition leader,
Zambia Daily Mail reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Beenwell Tunga was picked up on the charge of defamation of
character and has been detained at Lusaka's Woodlands police
station.
</P>
<P>
Vice-President of the newly founded opposition United Party for
National Development (UPND), John Mulwila, confirmed the arrest of
Tunga. But he said that he was not aware of the charge.
</P>
<P>
Tunga had gone into hiding after he was paraded before the
press by UPND Lusaka province chairman Joseph Chilengi two weeks
ago when they alleged that Tunga had been paid 500,000 Kwacha
(over 200 U.S. dollars) by Chiluba and Lusaka province Deputy
Minister Sonny Mulenga to trail and assassinate UPND leader
Anderson Mazoka.
</P>
<P>
Chilengi was arrested earlier and subsequently charged with
defamation of the president and was released on police bond. He is
expected to appear in court soon.
</P>
<P>
State House spokesman Richard Sakala has denied that the
president paid Tunga and said legal action would be taken against
the culprits.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Vice President Specioza
Kazibwe will defend herself over the Vally dams where she has been
accused of neglect of duty by a parliamentary select committee on
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Kagole Kivumbi, spokesman to the Parliament, told Xinhua
Wednesday that the vice president will argue for herself Wednesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Her defense follows a demand Tuesday by the committee that
President Yoweri Museveni take appropriate actions against
Specioza Kazibwe for her neglect of duty in Vally dam
construction.
</P>
<P>
William Kanyike, chairman of the 18-member committee, said in
his report presented to the House that Kazibwe, who is also the
Minister of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries, made a
serious mistake in contracting out the Vally dam construction to
companies which are not qualified to do so.
</P>
<P>
She was also blamed for authorizing signing of the bizarre
contracts despite pockets of resistance in the ministry.
</P>
<P>
In the Vally dam scandal, a total of 3.4 billion shillings
(3.4 million U.S. dollars) has been reported missing.
</P>
<P>
Kivumbi said that a resolution is likely to be reached by the
House this week.

<HEADLINE> Obese Boy in China Loses 60 Kilograms in Half Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Deng Xuejian, believed to be the
heaviest 11-year-old boy in the world with a weight of 174
kilograms, has lost 60 kilograms since he began receiving medical
treatment at the Aimin weight-loss center in northern China's
Tianjin Municipality last September.
</P>
<P>
Deng's weight has been reduced from 174.25 to 114 kilograms in
the past six months, and his chest measurements have gone from 165
to 125 centimeters and waist from 154 to 113 centimeters.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very rare case," said one doctor. Five doctors at
the center worked out a special treatment plan for Deng focusing
on controlling his sleep, diet, and exercise, and they are
employing acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine as well.
All his medical treatment is being provided free of charge.
</P>
<P>
According to the course of therapy, he is taking traditional
Chinese medicine and acupuncture every other day, running over 3,
000 meters and walking 20,000 meters everyday, and has an egg and
milk for breakfast and some meat and vegetables. Deng also has 100
grams of staple food for lunch, and vegetable and vitamins for
dinner.
</P>
<P>
The doctors want to see Deng lose an additional 50 kilograms
within the next six months, so he will then be able to live a
normal life among children of his own age.
</P>
<P>
Deng was born into a farm family in Tianjin's Baodi County and
weighed only three kilograms at birth. His weight increased to 15.
5 kilograms seven months later, and his weight continued to
increase by 10 to 15 kilograms every year since then.
</P>
<P>
His parents used to take him to the hospital for physical
examinations and the results were always the same: everything
about him is normal except for his weight.
</P>
<P>
Deng entered primary school at the age of six, and he was among
the top three among more than 20 classmates. But he had to quit
school because of his obesity.
</P>
<P>
"What I want most now is to go back to school as soon as
possible," the boy said when asked what he wanted most.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Fuel Imports Rise by 12% </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The National Fuel Committee
of Ethiopia has said the amount of petroleum imports has increased
by 12 percent after the country started utilizing the port of
Djibouti in May last year, local English weekly "the Reporter"
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The weekly newspaper quoted Haile Assegide, chairman of the
board of the committee as saying that Ethiopia was previously
importing 80-85 million liters of petroleum per month while using
the Assab port, while it is now importing 100 million liters a
month.
</P>
<P>
Haile said the country previously was keeping very low amount
of petroleum in reserve which could last only a few days.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, with the view of reserving petroleum that
would be consumed for months, the government had embarked upon the
construction of petroleum depots in different parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
After listing construction of petroleum depots in different
parts of the country, the board chairman said these depots are
expected to reserve petroleum that would meet more than 90 percent
of the country's demand for petroleum for three months.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- China will further crack down on
fake and shoddy iron and steel products and standardize the
domestic market, according to an official with the State
Administration of the Metallurgical Industry.
</P>
<P>
China, the world's leading iron and steel producer, has an
annual output of over 100 million tons of related products.
Nonetheless, the metallurgical industry's profits dropped from a
record 29.4 billion yuan to only two billion yuan in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The sector plans to reduce its 1999 output by 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Yang Xiaoning, director of the Metallurgical Economic
Development Research Center, said that efforts to control the
gross output of iron and steel are designed to reverse the
imbalance in supply and demand, and stimulate market prices.
</P>
<P>
However, the fact that supply will fall short of demand on some
local markets will also provide an opportunity for an increase in
fake and shoddy products. Zhao Xizi, deputy director of the
administration, noted that it is absolutely essential to crack
down on such products.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Gulf, A Long-term Weapons Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 17 (Xinhua) -- With the oil price slump
hitting the incomes of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states,
many analysts predict that this year's International Defense
Exhibition (IDEX '99) may not end with large contracts.
</P>
<P>
The prediction is apparently well-based. The oil prices, down
by about 40 percent over the last 12 months, have hit the GCC
countries badly, for oil accounts for at least 70 percent of the
earnings in all of the GCC states but Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
The decline of oil incomes may curb the GCC states' defense
spending in the short term, as conventional wisdom dictates. But,
as the factors that stimulate defense spending still exist, the
region's weapons market will remain large in the long term.
</P>
<P>
Defense spending is essentially decided by the threats that a
country thinks exist. As long as tensions and supposed threats
exist, defense spending will remain large.
</P>
<P>
The outbreak of the Gulf War in 1991, caused by Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein's ill-devised military expedition into Kuwait, put
GCC countries into endless worries about their security, which in
turn spurred them to launch ambitious defense programs.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait, the victim of Iraqi invasion, has moved at a greater
pace than any of its neighbors, spending more than 8 billion
dollars procuring weapons and equipment since the end of the Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain
all have been moving quickly to make their armed forces strong,
acquiring huge amounts of military hardware from the U.S.,
Britain, France and a variety of other exporters.
</P>
<P>
Now with the U.S. and British warplanes striking Iraq almost on
a daily basis, the tensions in the Gulf are not relaxed at all.
</P>
<P>
Iran's dispute with the UAE over the Gulf islands of Abu Mousa
and Greater and Lesser Tunbs only adds to the tensions. The UAE
has protested many times against Iran's "provocative" moves on or
near the islands.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has stressed that the ongoing IDEX '99 has nothing to
do with tensions in the region. This may be true, for the event is
held bi-annually. But, as all big defense companies see, the Gulf
has been and will remain a huge weapons market, which has much to
do with the region's situation.
</P>
<P>
The low oil prices may cause a slowdown in the Gulf's military
equipment purchases in the next three to four years, but after
that, the situation will improve, according to Alan Patterson, an
official of the British Ministry of Defense.
</P>
<P>
His view was echoed by defense officials of other important
countries attending IDEX '99.
</P>
<P>
New orders may not be placed by many of the Gulf countries but
existing orders have not been canceled, they said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> FIFA to Fund Zambian Soccer Team's Air Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Soccer's world governing body FIFA
will pay for the air travel of the Zambian under-20 national
soccer team for the next month's FIFA World Youth Championships to
be held in Nigeria, Zambian newspaper Zambia Daily Mail reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
FIFA will pay the air tickets for 25 people and a reasonable
amount of excess luggage for the return journey from each
participating national association at World Youth Cup.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian Local Organizing Committee will bear the costs of
board and lodging for nine double rooms and seven single rooms for
18 players and seven officials during the tournament.
</P>
<P>
Exceptions may be made owing to unforeseen circumstances
resulting from transport difficulties which are recognized by the
committee for FIFA Youth Competitions.
</P>
<P>
The development is a relief to the Football Association of
Zambia which has admitted that they are cash-strapped following
the government's withdrawal of funding to the association.

<HEADLINE> American Movie "Mulan" Fails to Stir "Titanic" Wave in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- A foreign-looking Hua Mulan, the
leading character in Walt Disney's cartoon movie "Mulan" based on
a Chinese folk story, has failed to attract as many moviegoers as
anticipated in the heroine's home country since the movie was
premiered in late February.
</P>
<P>
Hua Mulan is a legendary figure who joined the army in place
of her old and sick father during the Sui Dynasty, 1,300 years ago.
Nobody guessed she was female until the war ended because she
disguised herself as a man. Hua Mulan was later hailed as a great
warrior for her brilliant achievements.
</P>
<P>
As it closed yesterday in cinemas in central China's Hunan
Province, local box-office sales barely reached 250,000 yuan, only
half the income generated by another Hollywood hit movie called "
Rush Hour" starring Jackie Chan of Hong Kong, which was released
simultaneously in the province.
</P>
<P>
But neither film was a match for Hollywood's "Titanic" which
sailed into China last year and came away with 8 million yuan in
Hunan alone.
</P>
<P>
"Mulan" also had bad luck in the southern province of Guangdong
and in Shanghai, China's most bustling city with a population of
over 14 million. Only 200,000 people in Shanghai went to see "
Mulan," and barely 2 million yuan was taken in at the box office.
</P>
<P>
"It is far from what we had expected," said one official of the
municipal movie-distribution company.
</P>
<P>
He cited an unfavorable release time as one reason for the
movie's flop. "Mulan" debuted on February 23 in Shanghai just as
the new school semester was about to start. This prevented many
young people and their parents from going to see it, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, people in Hunan hold different views. One viewer in
Changsha, the provincial capital, said that the Disney version of
Hua Mulan is completely different from the story the Chinese learn
through poems and folk stories, and that her complexion,
disposition and manner of behavior were different.
</P>
<P>
One movie commentator claimed that it is all right for a
cartoon movie to have its distinct interpretation of characters,
but the problem is that Chinese children might be more familiar
with and interested in such Disney figures as Mickey Mouse than
the legendary Chinese heroine.
</P>
<P>
She added that generally speaking, cartoon pictures lack appeal
to adult Chinese audiences.
</P>
<P>
Some movie industry insiders say that the fact that "Mulan" was
successful in the United States but apparently failed in her
homeland, indicates that China had better make use of its own
abundant cultural resources to instill traditions in the younger
generation.
</P>
<P>
The movie is set for an April 14 release in Beijing, but
considering its reception in other parts of China so far, it is
unlikely to do well there either.

<HEADLINE> More Private Enterprises In Ningbo Development Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The number of private
enterprises in the development zone of Ningbo, a coastal city in
east China's Zhejiang Province, has topped 1,000.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises have a total registered capital of 1.2 billion
yuan, thanks to the introduction of a series of flexible policies.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-six new private enterprises opened in the zone in
January and 16 more were set up in February, more than twice as
many as in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Private enterprises are allowed to register locally without
any limitations placed on business scope, size, or expansion speed.
</P>
<P>
Private businesses in the zone paid 60 million yuan in taxes
last year and earned 130 million yuan in foreign exchange from
exports.
</P>
<P>
As one of the earliest state-level development zones, the 15-
year-old Ningbo Development Zone now has 442 overseas-funded
enterprises using capital from 30 countries and regions.

<HEADLINE> Seminar on U.N. Peacekeeping Opens in New Delhi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 17 (Xinhua) -- An international seminar on
U.N. peacekeeping operations opened here Wednesday with India
calling on certain countries to pay their arrears to the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
Indian Minister of State for External Affairs Vasundhara Raje
said at the opening ceremony that the United Nations has been
facing an acute financial crisis created by the reluctance of some
countries to pay their assessed contribution.
</P>
<P>
India believes that assessed contributions are a treaty
obligation and must be paid in full on time and without
preconditions, Raje told the seminar, which is being jointly held
by the ministries of external affairs and defense.
</P>
<P>
The world has witnessed instability, war and ethnic strife not
only in Asia and Africa, but also in Europe while the U.N.
peacekeeping budget had been reduced to less than one-third of the
level a few years ago, said Raje.
</P>
<P>
She also called for reform and expansion of the U.N. Security
Council, which sets the mandate for peacekeeping operations.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, India provided a total of 50,000 troops to 29
peacekeeping operations, some of which in most risky areas
including Egypt, Congo, Cambodia, Somalia and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Young-Jin Choi, U.N. assistant secretary general in charge of
U.N. peacekeeping operations, gave an overview of U.N.
peacekeeping activities around the world.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day seminar, delegates will discuss
peacekeeping operations and experiences in Africa, international
humanitarian law and U.N. peacekeeping, India's experience in
peacekeeping, and leadership and management of senior commanders.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Experiences Unseasonable Weather </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Beijing, the Chinese capital has
witnessed unseasonable weather featuring heavy fog, low visibility,
high humidity, occasional periods of sporadic sleet and lower
temperatures over the past 10 days.
</P>
<P>
The Capital International Airport was forced to close during
various periods owing to heavy fog which also led to an increase
in motor vehicle accidents in urban districts.
</P>
<P>
Experts with the Beijing Meteorological Observatory explained
that the unseasonable weather has been caused by the arrival of
weak cold fronts from north.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the fact that central heating is still available
in most of the capital's residential areas has increased the
volume of coal dust and smoke emissions in the thick cloud cover.
The failure of low pressure and weak breezes has in turn resulted
in increased pollution levels in the city.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists note that the unseasonable weather will linger
for at least one or two more days. Strong winds expected around
March 20 will ease the pollution problem somewhat.

<HEADLINE> Coles Leaves "Dead Cat" on Table at SOCOG, Says Board Member  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The refusal of Australia's
International Olympic Committee (IOC) member Phil Coles to step
down from the Sydney Olympics organizing board had left SOCOG with
"a dead cat on the table," a fellow board member said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ron Phillips, the New South Wales state opposition spokesman on
the Olympics, joined several board members in urging Coles to quit
from his role with the 2000 Games.
</P>
<P>
Coles has been investigated by the IOC for accepting bribery
from Salt Lake City during its bid to host the 2002 Winter
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Coles, 67, quit his position in the Australian Olympic
Committee last week citing health reasons. But he cannot be
sacked from the SOCOG board as the its contract with the IOC
stipulates that all Australian IOC members should be on the board.
</P>
<P>
"A dead cat has landed on the table of the SOCOG board and the
problem is going to remain while Phil Coles hangs around,"
Phillips said. "There is no doubt the feeling is that Phil Coles
remaining on the board diminishes the standing of SOCOG and the
Sydney Olympics in the eyes of the community."

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Witnesses Recovering Steel Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The demand for steel in Shanghai
has exhibited signs of recovery since the beginning of this month
along with increasing investment, according to one market analyst.
</P>
<P>
Tao Yonggen, a analyst for the East China Steel Market, said
the slow but positive recovery has been apparent since the
beginning of March, adding that sales of all types of steel
products have rebounded during the month.
</P>
<P>
The Baoshan Iron and Steel Company, a leading steel complex of
the country, sold 1,100 tons of seamless steel tubing over a 10
day period early this month, said Tao.
</P>
<P>
growing sales have also sparked rising steel prices, according
to Tao. He noted that threaded steel with a diameter of 25 mm is
currently selling at around 2,030 yuan per ton, up by some 30 yuan
on the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute the recovery in steel demand to the effects
of the proactive fiscal policy and peak production season for
appliances.
</P>
<P>
However, experts note that the structural overproduction of
steel has not as yet been rectified and therefore the current
recovery will most likely be limited.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to restructure the steel sector should be continued in
order to prevent a new round of overproduction, according to
experts.

<HEADLINE> 13 Lebanese Charged With Spying for Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Eleven Lebanese men and two women
have been charged with spying for Israel, the Daily Star reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Assistant military prosecutor Myassar Shokor said they were
believed to have been recruited by Israeli intelligence to
collect information on Lebanese, Syrian military forces and
Palestinian leftist groups, the paper quoted judicial sources as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Shokor has requested sentences from three to 15 years in
prison with hard labor, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The group was uncovered after the arrest and interrogation of
an officer of the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army last month.
</P>
<P>
The officer, Mohammed Khalil Nabaa, was responsible for
security in the village of Shebaa in the western sector of the
Israeli occupied border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He is believed to have spied on a Palestinian military group in
Lebanon and facilitated the arrest of some of the group's fighters.
</P>
<P>
Some of the 13 arrested are also suspected of selling drugs to
Israeli troops inside the border zone and smuggling European and
U.S.-made cigarettes into Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the self-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese

<HEADLINE> Psychologists Use Music for Treatments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Music can be used as an effective
medical treatment especially for psychological diseases, according
to a leading Chinese psychologist.
</P>
<P>
The Musical Therapy Research Center of the Central Conservatory
of Music, the first of its kind in China, has cured dozens of
patients suffering from diseases such as depression, neurasthenia,
mysophobia (an unhealthy obsession with cleanliness) and other
phobias since its opening last September, according to Gao Tian,
one of the founders.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the musical therapy doctor usually spends
three to five hours to diagnose the patient's condition, and then
makes up a musical prescription.
</P>
<P>
"After the patient goes into a semi-conscious state while
listening to the music, the doctor will change the musical rhythms,
which apparently allows the patient give vent to pent-up feelings,
" Gao explained.
</P>
<P>
"When the patient's mood falls to the lowest point, it will
instinctively rise and then the doctor will switch the music to
joyful and positive themes, thus giving the patient the impression
of being happy, fearless and self-confident," said Gao.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that musical therapy, which has no side effects,
can help treat diseases including cancer and high blood pressure
resulting from long-term depressions. It can also improve people's
memory.
</P>
<P>
But he explained that musical therapy is not suitable for
everyone. Patients should be fond of music at least and must have
received some education.

Infringement of intellectual property rights denies owners the
opportunity to make a reasonable return on their investment and
slows down the momentum of a knowledge-based economy in sustaining
its growth.
</P>
<P>
"While we have an intellectual property legislative regime
which is one of the most comprehensive and up-to-date, we
recognize that we face an uphill battle against infringement of
intellectual property rights and must have the cooperation of the
concerned industries, including the film making, film distribution
and entertainment industries, as well as the general public," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Tung said the government is open to suggestions to further
improve and strengthen the protection of intellectual property
rights. "We have issued a consultation paper to seek the views of
the public on the need for further legislative measures to combat
intellectual property rights infringements."
</P>
<P>
"We also recognize the importance of public education to our
fight against the piracy and counterfeiting problem, and is
devoting more public resources to promoting awareness in this
important area. We look forward to continuing our cooperation with
the industry in this area," he said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that pirates have helped force two-thirds of
film-makers and actors out of work and push box-office receipts
for local films to a record low for the past decade.

<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Taklimakan Desert, China's
largest, in the northwestern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is
turning warmer and moister, while the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is
being more frequented by snowstorms due to global climatic changes,
according to a recent report in the Science Times newspaper.
</P>
<P>
A recent study by Chinese meteorologists shows that the
temperature in the northern Xinjiang is rising by 0.6 degrees
Celsius every year on average, while the temperature in the
southern region has risen 0.3 degrees Celsius yearly over the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
The winter in the region has also become shorter, and the
annual rainfall in the northern area has increased by 18 percent
and in the south by more than 30 percent over the past ten years.
</P>
<P>
The Taklimakan Desert, often called the "sea of death," has
been experiencing more rainfall over recent years, and satellite
sensors indicate that some transient lakes have been appearing in
the desert.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, global climatic changes have also brought more
snowstorms to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and the snows there in
the 1990s were twice as heavy as they were in the 1960s, according

<HEADLINE> Zambia Red Cross Allowed to Assess Refugee's Camps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Red Cross Society (ZRCS)
has been given the mandate to assess proposed areas of settlement
for the military and civilian refugees who have flooded into the
country as war escalates in the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC).
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's Times of Zambia newspaper quoted ZRCS as saying
hundreds of Congolese refugees fleeing into Zambia through Kaputa
in Northern Province are living in open countryside with neither
shelter nor facilities.
</P>
<P>
"The majority of the new arrivals are located at reception
center at a partially-built school in the town area but many
others are surviving in the open countryside," ZRCS spokesman
Kampata Banda said in Lusaka Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Official reports indicate an influx into Zambia of about 2,000
refugees including at least 750 DRC government soldiers from the
DRC towns of Pepo and Pweto after a rebel offensive.
</P>
<P>
Banda said ZRCS was selected to manage refugee camps in
accordance with the contingency plan established by the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other agencies.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR had asked ZRCS to provide assistance in asserting the
 suitability of new refugee camp sites near Kasama and Mporokoso
following the latest influx of refugees into Kaputa, he said.
</P>
<P>
Banda said the International Federation of Red Cross Societies
(IFRC) had provided funds to ZRCS to enable it to mobilize and
deploy an emergency team from headquarters in Kaputa.
</P>
<P>
"The emergency team consisting four senior staff is currently
in Kaputa area and is being assisted in their work by a water and
sanitation program officer sent by the IFRC," he said.

WELLINGTON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand will keep "a close
watch" on developments in Europe following the resignation Tuesday
of all 20 members of the European Union's Executive Commission,
New Zealand Minister for International Trade Lockwood Smith said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a media statement issued upon his return from a visit to

four billion NZ dollars (2.2 billion U.S. dollars), or 18.21
percent of our exports," he said.
</P>
<P>
"New Zealand is discussing a number of ongoing trade issues
with the Commission. But at this stage, we are not concerned that
the resignations will have a negative impact on New Zealand
exports to Europe," Smith added.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand, he said, will continue to work on trade access
issues with the European Union through its existing relationships
within the commission.

<HEADLINE> Growth of Marriage to Foreigners Slows Down in Qingdao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The increase of marriage to
foreigners and overseas Chinese has slowed down in Qingdao, a
coastal port city in east China's Shandong Province, in recent
years in contrast with a boom during the early nineties.
</P>
<P>
The number of residents in the city who married foreigners and
overseas Chinese last year grew three percentage points less than
in 1997, according to the local civil affairs bureau.
</P>
<P>
While foreigners and overseas Chinese seem to be losing favor
with local residents, marriages involving overseas people have
gains in quality as the difference in age between husbands and
wives has become less dramatic than before.
</P>
<P>
In more than half of the marriages last year, the age gap was
reduced to no more than ten years, and it was rare to see a young
woman going to register a marriage with a man twice her age.
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of the couples got married after they had known each
other for more than one year, up about 30 percent from previous
years.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute the changes to the fact that fewer local
residents view marriage as the pathway to a better life or a way
to see the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Marriages to foreigners and overseas Chinese began again after
1978, when China started its reforms and opening up to the outside
world.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Domestic Debt to Top 150 Billion Shillings </HEADLINE>

<P>
NAIROBI, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's domestic debt has
increased sharply in the past two years and is expected to reach
150 billion shillings (about 2.4 billion U.S. dollars) by June,
kenya's State Minister Julius Sunkuli said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sunkuli said that interest payments on foreign and domestic
debts absorbed 23 percent of the government's 1995-1996 budget,
Kenya's major newspaper Daily Nation reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that Kenya's efforts to invigorate the
economy were undermined by the suspension of the loan by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), resulting in a reduction in
creating new jobs.
</P>
<P>
He said the various fiscal and monetary polices have been
adopted in a bid to repay the domestic debt.
</P>
<P>
He also announced the establishment of a Ministerial Public
Expenditure Review through which ministries are expected to
"restructure their expenditure" and promote the utilization of
public funds.

<HEADLINE> Malnutrition Lowers South China Tiger's Fertility Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Tigers in south China zoos are
suffering malnutrition as a result of poor food quality which, say
experts, is slowly lowering their fertility rate and damaging
their health.
</P>
<P>
An international symposium was recently informed that two
surveys in 1995 and 1997 on four zoos in China showed that the
fourteen South China tigers there are provided with raw meat
instead of small, live animals and eggs. Most of meat is too lean
and the additives affect the tigers digestive systems.
</P>
<P>
"The food we give to tigers does not have enough nutritional
value, and this has resulted in the decline of their health and a
lower fertility rate," said Xie Zhong, secretary-general of the
Chinese Association of Zoos.
</P>
<P>
She revealed that the 56 South China tigers in captivity in 22
Chinese zoos are the only ones in the world. They belong to one of
the ten major endangered species listed by international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The inbreeding and caging of tigers are other factors which
hinder the development of the species. A survey on eight male
South China tigers in 1997 showed that two could not produce any
semen, one has inactive sperm and most of the other five have a
lower sperm quality than normal.
</P>
<P>
In a bit to protect the species, China has established a
special committee to coordinate protective measures and has
established a gene bank for the South China Tiger.
</P>
<P>
The gene bank in Shanghai will use semen for future artificial
insemination, and stores samples of tiger cells, hair and blood
for research purposes.
</P>
<P>
Now the Chongqing Zoo plans to build a special tiger country-
style sanctuary, dozens of times larger than the original
dwellings for its four tigers.
</P>
<P>
Last October, the State Forestry Administration established a
South China Tiger nature reserve in Fujian Province and moved five
tigers there to enjoy a wilder living environment.

Speaking at the Social and Development Conference for East and
South Africa held here, the president pointed out that it was
high time African leaders became courageous and forthright in
articulating issues they believed to be important to their
people, the Kenya Times reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He noted that ostracism would send a clear message to dampen
appetites for coups.
</P>
<P>
Moi also urged non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to be
transparent and show how they spent money for development
projects.
</P>
<P>
Currently it was apparent that development money channelled
through NGOs ended in individual pockets, he said, adding that it
was hypocritical for some NGOs to ask Kenya to invite investors
while they were fermenting chaos using trade unions and students
in the institutions of higher learning.
</P>
<P>
The president also accused some NGOs in Kenya of corruption and
 subversion, saying that they used donor funds to finance activism
in trade union.

<HEADLINE> Moderate Earthquake Hits Areas Near Sydney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- An earthquake hit the Sydney
region Wednesday, cutting power to more than 2,000 homes, shutting
down mines and jamming emergency switchboards, the Australian
Broadcasting Corporation reported.
</P>
<P>
There were no reports of casualties yet.
</P>
<P>
Seismologists said more earthquakes are expected over the next
few weeks following Wednesday's tremor, which was the second
within a week in New South Wales (NSW), whose capital is Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's quake measured 4.7 on the Richter scale and was
felt up to 200 km from the epicenter, which was about 5 km south
of Appin, in Sydney's south-west.
</P>
<P>
About 2,200 homes and businesses in Appin and Camden, about 60
km from Sydney, were without power for up to 90 minutes following
the earthquake at 12.58 p.m., Australian Eastern Daylight Time
(AEDT).
</P>
<P>
Emergency service organizations were flooded with calls from
across Sydney, while several coal mines in the local area were
temporarily evacuated in case of a collapse.
</P>
<P>
Kevin McCue, a seismologist with the Australian Geological
Survey Organization, was quoted by the Australian Associated Press
as saying he believed a series of earthquakes would hit Sydney
over the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
An earthquake measuring 4.2 on the Richter scale was recorded
in West Wyalong, in central NSW, at 11.13 a.m. AEDT Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"It is a fact of life that earthquakes occur in swarms. There
may be four, or five, or six occurring within days or weeks,"
McCue said.
</P>
<P>
"I would not be surprised if a couple more earthquakes occurred
in NSW or (the neighboring state) Victoria over the next few
weeks".

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh, U.S. Firm Sign Accord for Power Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh and a United
States-based corporation have signed a 280-million U.S. dollar
power purchasing agreement for the proposed 450-megwatt Meghnaghat
Combined Cycle Power Plant, press reports said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year agreement was signed between the Bangladesh Power
Development Board (BPDB) and the AES Corporation in Dhaka Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the pact, the AES Corporation will invest about 280
million dollars for the gas-run power plant to be set up at
Meghnaghat, 20 kilometers southeast of Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
The proposed Meghnaghat power plant, which will be the single
largest power project in the country, will be developed by a
private developer on the "build-own-operate" basis.
</P>
<P>
Both sides have to reach understanding on three more agreements
including implementation, fuel supply and the land leasing,
according to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
During the whole period, the BPDB would have to purchase all
electricity generated from the project.
</P>
<P>
After the signing of all the final agreements, the private
developer would have to complete its financial closure within six
months and the plant would have to be in operation within the next
30 months.
</P>
<P>
In case of failure on the part of the private developer, the
BPDB would be in a position to charge penalty at 45,000 dollars
per day.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, if the BPDB fails to take the electricity,
it would have to pay capacity charges to the private developer.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Zambian police have embarked on a
nation- wide training program to equip officers with contemporary
crime prevention methods.
</P>
<P>
The police command said its vision was to cover all stations in
the country with community policing activities by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Community Service Division, Francis Musonda, said
Tuesday in Lusaka that the Police Service has approved a training
program for community liaison officers who will be responsible for
implementation of the service program.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's Zambia Daily Mail newspaper quoted the command as
saying the officers trained will initiate and implement crime
prevention programs and consolidate the ones existing in
collaboration with members of the community.
</P>
<P>
He said about 70 officers have so far been trained in Lusaka
and were already working.
</P>
<P>
Musonda said each station would have two officers sorely
reserved for community policing duties and teach members of the
community some crime prevention planning models.
</P>
<P>
The models include crime analysis system where a particular
area would be studied with a view of identifying root causes of
crime in that area and finding measures to stop or prevent crime,
he said.

WASHINGTON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Phil Jackson, who has been
talked as a possible candidate to coach the New Jersey Nets, has
no plan to return to the NBA.
</P>
<P>
His agent Todd Musburger said Thursday: "At the present time,
Phil is enjoying time with his family at a time in the year when
the NBA schedule used to prevent it."
</P>
<P>
When he retired from the Chicago Bulls at the conclusion of
last season, Jackson, 53, said he planned to spend at least one
year away from the NBA.
</P>
<P>
"His plans have not changed, and although he continues to keep
up with developments in the NBA, he is not at this point looking
to return any time soon. If that changes, we will be happy to
make it known," Musburger said.
</P>
<P>
The Nets fired their coach John Calipari Monday and Don Casey
is running the team on an interim basis.
</P>
<P>
Nets general manager John Nash said Tuesday they could wait
until midsummer to decide who will be the new coach.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Interview: President Jiang's Swiss Visit a Milestone (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland's ambassador to China,
Dominique Dreyer, said Chinese President Jiang Zemin's first ever
state visit to his country will be the most important event since
the two nations established their bilateral diplomatic ties in
1950.
</P>
<P>
Dreyer is a veteran diplomat who has been involved in Sino-
Swiss relations ever since the 1970s. He acknowledged that
Switzerland was among the first group of the Western countries to
recognize New China.
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that this visit will be crowned with a success
and be a milestone in bilateral relations," said Dreyer.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang will pay a three-day visit to Switzerland,
later this month, traveling to the Swiss capital of Bern, Geneva,
a financial and banking center, and Basel, a leading industrial
city in the north.
</P>
<P>
He will hold talks with Ruth Dreifuss, president of the Swiss
Confederation, and meet with personages from all walks of life in
Switzerland, especially those from business circles. Moreover,
according to Dreyer, cooperative agreements in the fields of
culture, education, economics and environmental protection are
expected to be signed.
</P>
<P>
As for the present Sino-Swiss economic and trade relations,
Dreyer said that the trade volumes have shown a growing trend in
recent years despite the effect to some extent of the Asian
financial crisis.

<P>
On Swiss-Chinese economic and trade relations, Dreyer said he
held that China and Switzerland have great potential for increased
trade cooperation, noting that more than 400 Swiss companies are
already involved in China including the giant ABB Company. He also
predicts that the two countries will confirm further cooperation
in particular with machine building sector and environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
"Switzerland is well known for its sophisticated technology in
the fields of industry, banking business and environmental
protection but China has probably the biggest potential market in
the world," added Dreyer, who expressed the belief that boosting
bilateral economic cooperation will help herald a new stage in
China's own economic development.
</P>
<P>
After analyzing the basic reason for Switzerland and China to
enjoying friendly relations for the past 50 years, Dreyer noted
that the two countries are peace-loving nations and their peoples
cherish profound feelings for friendship for each other. And there
are essentially no clash of fundamental interests between the two
nations.
</P>
<P>
"Over these long years, in recent years in particular, the
continuing exchange of visits between high-level officials has
enabled the relations between the two countries to become closer
still," said Dreyer, who also witnessed that as a result of the
dramatic changes taking place in China over the past two decades
its people are now more pragmatic and open-minded than in the past.
</P>
<P>
As a Swiss ambassador, he said he would encourage more Swiss
people to visit China or come to study the country on a business
tour while extending a greeting to any Chinese people keen to
travel to his beautiful country, which he believes will in turn
further increase mutual understanding and promote bilateral
relations.

<P>
JINAN, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Tuesday cloud-seeding efforts
carried to induce rainfall are expected to ease the drought
affecting 2.35 million ha of farmland in east China's Shandong
Province, one of China's major grain producers.
</P>
<P>
Yesterday's operation involving one aircraft brought light
overnight precipitation to five cities and prefectures, including
Jinan, the provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
Tonight's operation involving two aircraft is expected to bring
even more rainfall, according to the Jinan Cloud-seeding Office.
</P>
<P>
The province, located in the lower reaches of the Yellow River,
China's second longest river, has been in the grips of a rare
drought since early spring. The drought conditions have increased
pollution caused by wastewater discharges in the upper and middle
reaches of the river.
</P>
<P>
One waterworks along the river was forced to close in January.
</P>
<P>
However, urban residents and factories along the river do not
as yet face a water shortage due to the fact that the storage
capacity of local reservoirs is up by 2.47 billion cu.m. on last
year's level.

<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) has suggested educating Party and
government officials in the Party spirit and work style,
explaining that such a drive will improve their general qualities.
</P>
<P>
Focusing on study, political awareness and healthy ethics, the
drive will start among leading officials at and above the county
level across the country in two years, according to a notice of
the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Although China has enjoyed considerable achievements in
education drives of this kind in past years, there are still
unresolved problems.
</P>
<P>
It notes that changing situations and tasks bring both
opportunities and challenges but at the same time place new and
higher demands on officials, which concern their ability to solve
complicated problems in a practical way.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the emphasis on study, political awareness and
healthy ethics will be crucial in improving the genral qualities
of officials, and ensuring the overall implementation of the
Party's basic theory, guideline and principles, as well as helping
with the smooth progress of the reform, opening-up and
modernization drive, the document notes.
</P>

It acknowledges that leading officials in the Party are in
general more than adequate in their duties, but a number of them
still cannot cope with the demands of changing situations in China.

banned in the Party.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the education principles, the document stresses

SHENYANG, March 17 (Xinhua) -- An 18-part TV comedy featuring
old-age romance in China will soon be screened by China Central
Television (CCTV) and more than 100 local television stations

all lost their spouses and presents a lively modern-life episode
through the confrontation between modern civilization and out-
dated concepts, as well as disputes between old and young people.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of China (BOC) will to
provide consumer credit to car purchasers and dealers for the
Dongfeng-Citroen Automobile Corp. this year, according to an
agreement between the bank and the Chinese auto manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement which was signed on Monday, the BOC will
help the Sino-French joint venture sell its Fukang model cars
using the credit plan.
</P>
<P>
However, the two sides did not specify the exact amount of
money involved in the loan package.
</P>
<P>
"How many loans will be extended depends on the actual market
demand for Fukang cars," said an industry insider.
</P>
<P>
The BOC has granted 1.5 billion U.S. dollars to Dongfeng-
Citroen since May 1992, and last year the car maker sold about 36,
000 cars, up 20 percent from 1997, with sales volume hitting 3.5
billion yuan (421 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Dongfeng-Citroen has set its output target this year at 55,000
units. "Car sales are expected to increase this year because of a
package of government measures intended to stimulate domestic
consumption and the purchase of houses, cars, and electric
appliances," said Zhang Shiduan, president of the company.
</P>
<P>
With an investment of 10.3 billion yuan as an economic backup,

<HEADLINE> China to Tap Potential in African News Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- China's media organizations,
especially the Xinhua News Agency, have great potential and bright
prospects in exploring the news market in Africa, a populous
continent with a large market for news, said Alhaji Wada Maida,
visiting managing director of the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN),
here today in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Maida pointed out that sound political and economic cooperation
and the traditional friendship between the African countries and
China are to Xinhua's advantage if the agency wants to expand its
operations on the African continent.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua and NAN signed an agreement on the exchange of news
services in 1987, which allowed NAN, the state news agency of
Nigeria, to directly receive Xinhua's news through satellite. In
1998, the two agencies also agreed that NAN will help Xinhua to
increase subscribers in Nigeria, laying the foundation for further
cooperation between the two agencies.
</P>
<P>
Maida expressed his satisfaction with the cooperation between
the two agencies, saying that NAN uses many news items from Xinhua
everyday, because "Xinhua's news releases are of high quality in
terms of efficiency, range of coverage and information value, and
Xinhua can also stand with and serve the interests of the
developing countries."
</P>
<P>
"Due to the traditional African-Chinese friendship, almost all
African people regard China as a reliable old friend. Therefore,
they believe in Xinhua's reports, and regard them as authentic."
</P>
<P>
Maida has the ambition to turn NAN into a modernized news
agency. He made the trip to China to learn from Xinhua's
experiences in the process of modernization, and agreed with Guo
Chaoren, president of Xinhua, that the two sides should further
bilateral cooperation in the fields of news photography and
economic information.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1976, NAN is based in Abujia, the capital of
Nigeria, and has a principal office in the coastal city of Lagos
and 35 state and 38 district offices, as well as four foreign
bureaus.

comprehensive book covering the politics, economies, cultures,
education levels, religions and customs of the ethnic groups will
be published before the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
He added that related data will also be available on computer.
</P>
<P>
Some 2.06 million members of minority ethnic groups account for
42.8 percent of the province's total population.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Provide Scholarship to Students with Sports Talent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government is to
provide scholarships to 1,000 high school students who have
talents for sports but whose parents cannot afford their schooling.
</P>
<P>
"The program is expected to materialize soon and it is
important to continue it in the future," Youth and Sports Minister
Agung Laksono said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has prepared the mechanisms for scholarships so
recipient students can improve their academic as well as sport
performance, Laksono said.
</P>
<P>
The scholarship is part of the ministry's program to explore
sporting talents from students throughout the country, especially
for high school students.
</P>
<P>
To date, Laksono said, sports performance amongst students
needs financial support and continued training.
</P>
<P>
In addition, there is a need for more sport teachers, sports
equipment and special sport schools for talented students.
</P>
<P>
Islamic schools should also provide the chance to their
students to improve sporting achievements without abandoning their
study on religious affairs, Laksono was quoted by the Indonesian
Observer Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Another problem for students is that sports education is often
stopped after they finish high school and enter college.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, universities should also provide sport facilities
so that new athletes could emerge from campuses," Laksono added.

<HEADLINE> China Tax Reduction Unlikely in Near Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Experts have ruled out the
possibility of tax-reduction in the near future as a remedy to
spur up the Chinese economy.
</P>
<P>
Quoted by today's Economic Information Daily they said that
due to a complicated taxation structure, there is limited choice
for China to reduce taxes like many other countries.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that at present China's general tax burden has
just reached the world's medium level.
</P>
<P>
They also pointed out that it is unrealistic for China to adopt
a low-tax-rate system since the country, on its way towards
industrialization, is in urgent need of funds.
</P>
<P>
While reducing taxes can weaken the government's financial
strength, it may not be very effective in stimulating the economy,
since for many loss making enterprises, tax-reduction only means a
decrease in the amount of tax default, they observed.
</P>
<P>
They also said that a more realistic and urgent act would be to
reduce the enterprises' and farmers' heavy burdens caused by
irrational levies of fees by governments at various levels.

<HEADLINE> China Needs 4,000 Actuaries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- There is only one qualified
actuary in China, while the country's insurance market will need
some 4,000 actuaries in the near future, according to the China
Insurance Association.
</P>
<P>
Pan Lufu vice president of the association, was quoted in
Wednesday's China Economic Times as saying that China now has
around 40 "quasi-actuaries," or semi-qualified people, in addition
to the one qualified actuary among its 1.2 billion population.
</P>
<P>
An actuary is a specialist who calculates statistical risks,
premiums, and other factors related to the insurance industry, and
insurance companies are required to have at least one qualified
actuary and a system to report its actuarial work, according to
China's insurance regulations.
</P>
<P>
To be a qualified actuary, one must master mathematics,
statistics, economics, and investment science and have some
expertise in insurance. The country is now in great need of such
personnel.
</P>
<P>
More importance is now being given to the training of qualified
actuaries, Pan said, adding that nine graduate students at the
Central University of Finance and Economics have recently earned
master's degrees in actuarial studies.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Women Benefit from Sterilization Reversal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Sterilized women in China now
have the opportunity to have the operation reversed, if the
circumstances are acceptable.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the Shanghai No. 9 People's
Hospital has so far performed the operation on more than 3,000
sterilized women since it was first introduced in China in 1981.
</P>
<P>
An example of how the reversal can be of huge benefit is Xu
Jinmei, a formerly sterilized woman in east China's Jiangsu
Province. She suffered great pain since she lost her only son in
an accident. Fortunately she became pregnant after having the
skilled operation in Shanghai and now has pretty twins to comfort
her.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to improving medical techniques, the Shanghai hospital
has achieved a 100 percent success rate in the reversal procedure,
and 95 percent of women have later had another child.
</P>
<P>
As many as 160 million women in the world are estimated to seek
sterilization, tens millions of them are in China, as part of
family planning measures.
</P>
<P>
Medical experts say that the majority of couples who lose their
children from whatever cause later suffer from depression and the
operation can help them solve the problem.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai To Develop New Economic Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Chongming Island, China's third
largest island at the mouth of the Yangtze River, is expected to
become another major development area in the coming century,
following the Pudong New Area, an emerging financial and trade
zone in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the municipal government said Shanghai, the nation's
leading industrial and commercial center, is now making plans to
turn the 1,000-sq-km island into a center for new industries.
</P>
<P>
Priority is to be put on the development of free trade,
transfer shipping, export-oriented processing, eco-agriculture and
island tourism, the sources noted.
</P>
<P>
To prepare for massive construction, the municipality will soon
launch a series of infrastructure projects, including a tunnel
connecting the island with the city proper.
</P>
<P>
The idea is part of an overall blueprint for Shanghai to become
an international economic center by the year 2010. According to
the plan, a number of satellite towns will be built around the
city.
</P>
<P>
Chongming, which boasts 20,000 hectares of beaches and shoals
and abounds with natural resources, is approximately twice the
size of the Pudong New Area and has historically had an
agricultural focus.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Regards China as Important Dialogue Partner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) has always regarded China as an important
dialogue partner given its tremendous economic capacity, a
Malaysian official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This was because China's huge economic capacity could actually
contribute toward the ASEAN's economic progress and development,
Malaysia's Deputy Minister of Science, Technology and Environment
Datuk Abu Bakar Daud said at the opening of the second meeting of
the ASEAN-China Joint Cooperation Committee (ACJCC) here.
</P>
<P>
He said the ASEAN, which has extensive trade and investment
linkages with China, would like to see an economically stable
China.
</P>
<P>
"We in ASEAN wish to see China succeed in its efforts to
resolve the economic problems facing the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Abu Bakar expressed the ASEAN's appreciation of China's action
and economic measures aimed at assisting ASEAN members to recover
from the economic crisis and hoped that it will continue with its
effort.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN welcomes China's assurances not to devalue its
currency, the renminbi, despite tremendous pressure from several
parties, he said.
</P>
<P>
"While emphasis is being given in promoting economic
cooperation, equally important is the need to strengthen political
ties between ASEAN and China," Abu Bakar said.
</P>
<P>
He lauded consultations between China and the ASEAN through the
ASEAN Nine Plus Three (China, Japan and South Korea), Post
Ministerial Conferences (PMC) and the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF).
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting will focus on the review of the
implementation of projects approved by the first meeting in
Beijing, China, in 1997, which include the Economic and Trade
Seminar and the Officials Exchange Program between the ASEAN and
China.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will also revise and exchange views on the
cooperation between the ASEAN and China toward the new millennium
and study and approve a number of projects to be implemented under
the ASEAN-China Cooperation Fund.
</P>
<P>
It will discuss proposals to address the financial and economic
crisis that has spread in the ASEAN region and East Asia since
July 1997 and sought China's commitment to undertaking actions and
new policies to reduce the problem.
</P>
<P>
China's Assistant Foreign Minister Wang Yi is leading the
Chinese delegation at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Wang said at the opening that assurances by China's President
Jiang Zemin not to devalue the renminbi truly reflects the
country's commitment to helping its ASEAN neighbors during the
financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
"His (Jiang's) words demonstrate China's responsibility to hold
the renminbi stable so as to make contributions to the economies
in Asia and the world at large," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- College students outside Beijing
are to be given the chance to appreciate ancient Chinese poetry
thanks to a series of special readings featuring famous works from
the Tang (618-907) and Song (960-1279) dynasties.
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the Beijing Concert Hall, the recital, which began
on Monday this week and last to the end of March, will tour
universities in Tianjin, Nanjing, Shanghai, Xiamen, and Guangzhou.
</P>

by well-known poets in Tang and Song dynasties, with music
background.
</P>
<P>
A student from Tianjin's Nankai University said that he is
overcome with the eternal charm of such poetry which helps improve
the nation's cultural appreciation and boosts Chinese self-esteem
and pride.
</P>
<P>
The manager of Beijing Concert Hall said that any income from
the performances will be donated to the "China Hope Project", the
acclaimed educational scheme, to help establish two music primary
schools in Chongqing Municipality and Henan Province.

<HEADLINE> China Launches Publicity Drive to Popularize Coal Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- China is launching a massive
publicity campaign to popularize laws and regulations concerning
the coal industry among its vast coal enterprises and workers
nationwide, in a bid to ensure a sound development of the sector.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior official with the State Administration of
Coal Industry, the current coal law publicity drive focuses on
explicit stipulations to guide and ensure the exploration of coal
resources, safe production, the issuing of coal production permits,
special protection for coal miners as well as the transportation
and marketing of coal.
</P>
<P>
He said that popularization of laws including the Coal Law
among coal enterprises and workers is an important means to ensure
sound development of the coal industry, adding that China produces
nearly 1.3 billion tons of raw coal annually and is the world's
largest coal producer and consumer. The coal sector accounts for
75 percent of the country's energy resources production and
consumption.
</P>
<P>
However, in some parts of the country, there still exists
rampant illegal mining of coal resources, an overall waste in the
industry, accidents which lead to injuries and death, damage to
coal mines, and the irregular transportation and management of
coal products.

<HEADLINE> Thai Cabinet Okays Budget for Pollution Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet has approved a
5.7-billion-baht (154 million U.S. dollars) budget for 24
pollution-control projects under the National Economic and Social
Development Board's green fund package.
</P>
<P>
A government house news release available here Wednesday said
the amount comprises a 4-billion-baht (108 million dollars) loan
from Japan's Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund and 1.7 billion
baht (45.9 million dollars) from the annual budget.
</P>
<P>
All the 24 approved projects cover the period from 1999 to
2001, and relate to garbage treatment facilities, waste-water
treatment plants and air pollution-control facilities.
</P>
<P>
Priority is given to the pollution-control zone and provinces
which have serious environmental problems, the release said.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the 24 projects has been developed over the
past few years, but only 38.9 percent of the approved budget, or
3.88 billion baht (104.8 million dollars) out of a total of 9.97
billion baht (269.4 million dollars), has been spent due to
technical reasons.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet, therefore, asked the Office of Environmental
Policy and Planning to speed up the payment of the budget and
project construction to hasten the investment payback from the
pollution treatment fee of those projects.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet has also assigned the Science Ministry as
consultant for the local authorities in applying and processing
the projects, including helping to study the pollution treatment
charge rate, in accordance with the polluter-pay principle in the
1992 Environment Act.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Currency Depreciates Sharply Against Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Romania's national currency,
the leu, plummeted to 14,040 against the U.S. dollar on Monday,
losing 356 units compared with the previous trading day.
</P>
<P>
It is the biggest devaluation of the leu since the beginning of
this year.
</P>
<P>
The foreign exchange market opened 14,020 lei against the U.S.
dollar and closed 14,600 lei per dollar, with an average rate of
exchange calculated by Romania's central bank of 14,040 lei for
one U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Due to lack of confidence in the leu, traders stopped selling
dollars and plunged into buying dollars and other hard currencies.
Some bourses had to suspend trading dollars since their reserves
have been exhausted.
</P>
<P>
The leu has depreciated steadily since the start of the year.
It was kept stable briefly last week after the government took
measures such as raising interest rates to curb its downward trend.
</P>
<P>
However, the leu began to lose its value again this week and
dropped to below 14,000 lei against the dollar on Monday, which
roused concerns that the country may have lost control over its
national currency.
</P>
<P>
Experts contribute the sharp devaluation to a continued
economic recession, the banking crisis and the soaring fuel prices
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The financial authorities may further raise interest rates and
issue high-yield state bonds to prop up the leu, experts predict.

<HEADLINE> German Government Approves New Citizenship Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 16 (Xinhua) -- After weeks of debate, the German
government has approved the draft of a new citizenship law that
will give limited dual nationality to children born to foreign
residents.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the law is to facilitate the integration of
foreign residents into the German nation, the government said.
</P>
<P>
In a historic change to the nation's 1913 citizenship law, the
draft stipulates that children born to foreign residents would
automatically receive German citizenship. They would also be able
to keep their parents' nationality, but would have to choose one
or the other by the age of 23.
</P>
<P>
Due to strong resistance from opposition parties and many
German residents, the government, which had planned to make
unlimited dual nationality the rule, decided to reconsider and
amend some of the related issues.
</P>
<P>
Another major amendment and vital consideration to the current
law is shortening the duration of stay for foreigners applying for
German citizenship.
</P>
<P>
Under the draft bill, which was passed at a special cabinet
meeting, foreigners who want German citizenship need to reside in
Germany for eight years, seven years shorter than the previous
limit.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Otto Schily said a reform of the present
citizenship law is intended to promote the integration of foreign
residents and Germans, and to make it clear that "Germany is an
open and modernized country."
</P>
<P>
He also said that those who want to be German citizens should
not only understand Germany's constitution and meet some minimum
requirements, but also master the German language as stipulated in
the new law.
</P>
<P>
The bill will take effect on January 1, 2000, after being
ratified by both houses of the parliament and accepted by a
majority of the people.
</P>
<P>
Germany has nearly 7.4 million foreign residents, nearly 10
percent of the population.

But he said the exact date of the possible freeing of Army
Brig. Gen. Victor Obillo and Capt. Eduardo Montealto was not
mentioned by his source except for the initial assurance that the
release would be on account of the churchmen's efforts.
</P>
<P>
In Davao del Norte, troops sent to rescue Obillo and Montealto
encountered 20 NPA rebels Monday about 9 a.m.
</P>
<P>
The two Protestant bishops leaving for Utrecht are in addition

<HEADLINE> WBC Claims Lewis Robbed of "Clear Victory" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The World Boxing Council (WBC)
claimed in a statement issued here on Tuesday that its heavyweight
champion Lennox Lewis was robbed of his "clear victory" against
World Boxing Association (WBA) rival Evander Holyfield in their
unification battle.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Lewis was thought by many as having outclassed
American Evander Holyfield in the 12 rounds bout in New York
Saturday. But none of the boxers won the undisputed world
heavyweight boxing title when judges scored the fight a draw with
a decision that triggered a wide-spreading controversy.
</P>
<P>
"Lewis was unjustly robbed of a clear victory," the WBC
statement said, calling for a rematch with "clearer rules." It
said that Lewis "massacred Holyfield with an endless number of
devastating blows."
</P>
<P>
The WBC joined widespread criticism of WBA-appointed Eugenia
Williams, the only judge at the fight who awarded Holyfield the
victory.
</P>
<P>
"Our explanation is the little experience Ms Williams has for a
fight of this level and an excessive favoritism for a boxer of her
own country."
</P>
<P>
Williams was reportedly to have complained she had a poor view
and mainly saw Lewis' back during the fifth round in which Lewis
was believed to have landed 43 punches to 11 for Holyfield. The
woman judge had defended her score, saying that she had acted
according to what she saw during the fight.

<HEADLINE> Honduran Soldiers Join Police to End Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Some 12,000 Honduran Army
soldiers joined the police Tuesday to end the wave of violence
that is sweeping through this Central American country.
</P>
<P>
The move followed the order by President Carlos Flores to
deploy troops along the streets throughout the country,
particularly in densely populated areas.
</P>
<P>
The president has instructed Security Minister Elizabeth Chiuz
Sierra and Defense Minister Edgardo Dumas Rodriguez to coordinate
a joint operation between the military and police.
</P>
<P>
In the urban areas, soldiers were observed moving to areas
frequented by armed gangs of youths who often cast a shadow of
fear over the resident population.
</P>
<P>
At least five kidnappings have been reported so far this year.
In one case, parents had to pay a ransom to retrieve their seven-
year-old son.
</P>
<P>
While affected by violence ranging from kidnappings to armed
bank robberies, Honduras has also remained in a state of emergency
since hurricane "Mitch" devastated the country near the end of
last year.
</P>
<P>
Almost 6,000 people were reported dead and 8,000 missing during
the disaster, which left another 12,000 injured and 1.5 million
homeless.
</P>
<P>
Honduras has also seen a daily rationing of power since
February as a result of a fire in one of the transformers of the
country's principal hydro-electric plant. The plant has the
capacity to produce 300 megawatts of electricity.

<HEADLINE> Continued Dialogues Across Straits Desired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Political dialogues across the
Taiwan Straits should continue, suggests a mainland official.
</P>
<P>
"We hope during Wang Daohan's visit to Taiwan, the two sides
will continue political dialogues and deal with deeper issues,"
Tang Shubei, secretary-general of Beijing-based Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (Arats), was quoted as saying
by today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
"Not only should we continue exchanging our views freely, but
we should go one step further on the basis of last year's meeting,
" he added when meeting the press yesterday in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Wang, Arats' chairman, met Koo Chen-fu, chairman of Taipei-
based Straits Exchange Foundation (Sef), in Shanghai last October.
Wang and Koo candidly discussed a wide range of issues. The
meeting marked a resumption of high-level contacts across the
Straits. Contacts were suspended in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The two reached a consensus in October regarding Wang's visit,
which they said would take place at an appropriate time, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
Arats proposed this year's visit, he added.
</P>
<P>
Tang refuted Sef's allegation Arats has been dilatory in
preparing for Wang's visit.
</P>
<P>
To date, Arats and Sef have not contacted each other regarding
Wang's visit, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
It is unlikely, however, Wang will be able to visit Taiwan
before May, due to his tight schedule, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
Arats deputy secretary-general Li Yafei is scheduled to arrive
in Taipei today to finalize details of Wang's visit.
</P>
<P>
Tang, calling Wang's visit a continuation of Koo's visit, hopes
Wang will visit Taiwan under the atmosphere of progress.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, this is not determined solely by our side but by
joint efforts," Tang said.
</P>
<P>
The associations should sort out some issues and decide if they
can reach a consensus, Tang suggested.
</P>
<P>
Among the issues Tang mentioned were the "one China" matter,
opposition to Taiwan's independence, hostilities across the
Straits and enhancement of economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"We share quite a few things in common," Tang said, "If we
truly observe the principle of seeking common ground while
respecting difference, it will be possible for us to find more in
common within many issues, to solve issues gradually and further
our political dialogues," he said.

foreign troops trying to enter Kosovo as invaders.
</P>

The peace talks on Kosovo resumed Monday morning at the

conflicting sides are expected to sign a peace agreement on Kosovo
which was presented by the six-nation Contact Group on former
Yugoslavia.

No deadline was given for them to accept the peace plan, but
European Union officials expect the talks to end within one week.

<HEADLINE> Asian Recovery to Take Several Years: ABARE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Asia's economic recovery would
take several years, Australia's chief official commodities
forecaster the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource
Economics (ABARE) warned here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
ABARE said world growth is set to further weaken in 1999, with
instability worsening in Russia and Latin America while Asia
struggles to recover.
</P>
<P>
ABARE's March commodity outlook said it holds concerns for
Japan through to 2004.
</P>
<P>
"The situation remains difficult elsewhere in East Asia and
Southeast Asia, especially in Indonesia and Malaysia," it said.
</P>
<P>
"The economic recovery in the Asian region is likely to take
several years."
</P>
<P>
It said agricultural commodity prices dipped by up to 30
percent in 1998, and a crucial issue for commodity producers was
how long commodity prices would remain low.
</P>
<P>
"Economic commentators are increasingly of the belief that
world commodity prices are likely to remain relatively low for
some time," ABARE said.
</P>
<P>
"A major factor underlying this price assessment is an assumed
weak world economic outlook.
</P>
<P>
"Thus commodity demand is not expected to recover
significantly, at least not in the short term," it said.
</P>
<P>
ABARE said world economic growth would slow to 1.9 percent in
1999 from 2.3 percent in 1998, before a modest recovery in 2000
takes it to 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Beyond 2000, world economic growth is seen strengthening to up
to 3.3 percent a year over the medium term.
</P>
<P>
ABARE also warned that an oversupply of commodities could
undermine a price recovery.
</P>
<P>
Its outlook also predicted:
</P>
<P>
-- Japanese economic growth to remain sluggish;
</P>
<P>
-- China's growth to moderate;
</P>
<P>
-- Economic growth of the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD) to decline to 1.8 percent in 1999 from 2.1
percent in 1998, recovering to 2 percent in 2000 and then climbing
to 2.3 percent beyond 2000;
</P>
<P>
-- Growth of the United States to moderate to 2.7 percent in
1999 from 3.9 percent in 1998 and strengthen to 2.4 percent in
2000.
</P>
<P>
-- West European growth to decline to 1.9 percent in 1999
before climbing to 2.2 percent in 2000 and then sustained at 2.4
percent;
</P>
<P>
-- Non-OECD Asian growth (excluding Japan and South Korea) to
increase marginally;
</P>
<P>
-- Latin America to come under significant pressures in early
1999.

<HEADLINE> Hotline Offers Help to Laid-Off Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- A tip-off hotline went into
operation yesterday at the Ministry of Labor and Social Security
to help guard against infringement of the rights of redundant
workers.
</P>
<P>
The hotline was designed to enable the Ministry to have quicker
and better access to information about any violations against the
rights of redundant workers, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Laid-off workers are encouraged to come up with the hotline if
they do not benefit from state preferential policies in job
hunting.
</P>
<P>
Hotline officials would deal with problems in managing re-
employment funds and malpractice in re-employment centers.
</P>
<P>
Enterprise-based re-employment centers are responsible for 6.09
million workers laid off from state-owned enterprises, according
to latest statistics.
</P>
<P>
Once registered at a re-employment center, a redundant worker
would receive a government subsidy and retain their insurance
rights. Such centers are also obliged to provide job-oriented
training and information.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Army Drives Back Kosovo Separatists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRISTINA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav police and army troops
on Tuesday repelled attacks by Kosovo Albanian separatists, who
eventually retreated to the north-central mountainous areas in the
province, said army sources.
</P>
<P>
The government troops reportedly fought back after the
attacking Albanians fired mortars and machine guns at soldiers in
training and police on patrol missions. The clash occurred 35
kilometers north of Pristina.
</P>
<P>
Arms and ammunitions abandoned by the separatists were
collected and displayed to media representatives by the army,
while smoke from burning houses could be seen in the distance.
</P>
<P>
The separatists have stepped up harassment in an attempt to
weaken the Yugoslav government's position at the negotiation table,
the army said.
</P>
<P>
Vehicles of the OSCE mission were also observed rushing to the
trouble spot in efforts to prevent the fighting from escalating.

<HEADLINE> Uzbek President Asks for Interpol Help in Hunt for Bombers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Uzbek President Islam Karimov
Monday called for Interpol's cooperation in the capture of two men
who allegedly organized six bomb blasts last month in the Uzbek
capital of Tashkent.
</P>
<P>
Karimov said the Uzbek police had issued warrants against the
two men, Takir Yuldashev and Makhammad Solikh, the Interfax news
agency reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said Yuldashev, the leader of an Islamic fundamentalist
group headquartered in Pakistan, was believed to have fought in
the wars in Afghanistan and Tajikistan and also have ties to
Mullar Mohammad Omar, the leader of Afghanistan's Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Karimov said evidence showed that Solikh, one of his former
presidential challengers, had gone to Afghanistan to conspire with
Yuldashev in an attempt to seize the Uzbek presidency.
</P>
<P>
Salikh was defeated by Karimov in the 1991 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
On February 16, six blasts rocked Tashkent, killing 15 people
and injuring more than 100. The Uzbek police have so far detained
over 30 suspects.

<HEADLINE> China to Establish Erosion-Monitoring System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- China plans to establish a
national water and soil erosion-control monitoring system this
year, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
According to a latest report from the Ministry of Water
Resources, the proposed network, the first of its kind in China,
includes a monitoring system and an information transmitting and
data-processing system.
</P>
<P>
The network is projected to be completed in stages and be
operational before 2010, and will cost an estimated 866 million
yuan (104 million US dollars), the paper quoted a ministry
official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The network will be built at five levels, including a Beijing-
based State erosion-control monitoring center, several monitoring
hubs built along China's seven longest rivers and lakes, 30
provincial stations, 2,015 data-collecting sites and 155
monitoring branches in specially designed zones.
</P>
<P>
These zones will be capable of controlling 5.72 million square
km of erosion-prone land, and as a result about 59 percent of
China's territory could be monitored, according to the official.

TIRANA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- About 3,000 Serb Macedonians held
a rally in the capital city of Skopje on Tuesday, protesting
against the stationing of NATO troops in their country and the
planned deployment in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
According to the Macedonian Informative Agency (MIA), the
protesters, chanting slogans against NATO and the United States,
urged the Macedonian government to close the border to prevent the
NATO troops stationed there from entering Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo is a province of Yugoslavia's Serbia Republic, where the
predominantly ethnic Albanians have been fighting for independence.
</P>
<P>
So far, NATO has deployed 10,000 troops in Macedonia, who are
ready to enter Kosovo to police the peace agreement once it is
signed by the representatives of the secessionist Albanians and
the Serbs at the on-going peace talks in France.
</P>
<P>
In all, NATO plans to deploy 26,000 heavily armed peacekeepers

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Economy Predicted to Bottom Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government Tuesday
predicted that the country's crisis-hit economy should bottom out
in the first semester of the 1999/2000 fiscal year beginning in
April after shrinking by an estimated 16 percent in the current
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The inflation, running at an estimated 66 percent in the
current fiscal year, should moderate to within a range of 15 to 20
percent in 1999/2000, the government said in its supplementary
memorandum of economic and financial policies, a new letter of
intent to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
"Our central projection is for the real gross domestic product
(GDP) in 1999/2000 to be virtually unchanged, based on the
expectation that the economy will bottom out during the first half
of the fiscal year and that a modest recovery will begin
thereafter," The Jakarta Post Wednesday quoted the letter as
saying.
</P>
<P>
But it warned that a number of domestic and external risks
apply to the outlook, and the macroeconomic framework would be
reviewed regularly to ensure that policies remain consistent.
</P>
<P>
The government said it remains committed to pursuing a tight
monetary policy to stabilize prices and reduce the volatility of
the rupiah.
</P>
<P>
The budget deficit for 1999/2000 is projected to be 6 percent
of the GDP, with the assumption that the rupiah averages at 7,500
rupiah per U.S. dollar and the government collects 1.5 billion
dollars from its privatization program.
</P>
<P>
The government hopes to get an additional official external
support of about 5 billion dollars to plug the budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
On international trade, the government believes Indonesia's
balance of payments in 1999/2000 should improve steadily, with
export growth contributing to a "somewhat larger" external trade
surplus.
</P>
<P>
With that surplus, coupled with incoming official funds, the
country's gross external reserves are expected to increase to a
"more comfortable level" of around 29 billion dollars, compared
with the 24-billion-dollar level now.
</P>
<P>
To restore foreign investor confidence in the country, the
government said it would continue with its bank restructuring
measures and help solve private external debt hangover and improve
the legal structure.
</P>
<P>
The government decided on Saturday to close down 38 domestic
private banks, nationalize seven, recapitalize nine and let 73
relatively healthy ones continue operations.
</P>
<P>
It promised to complete the recapitalization process for the
nine banks by June 30.
</P>
<P>
To help solve the debt hangover, the government expects an
agreement with external private creditors to be reached on a
second interbank exchange offer to cover debts falling due during
the 1999/2000 period.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the IMF will disburse 1 billion dollars if
its board of directors approves the letter of intent.
</P>
<P>
The IMF is organizing a 43-billion-U.S.-dollar bailout for
Indonesia. The fund has already disbursed some 9 billion dollars
from its own commitment of 11.3 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serbs Protest Rulings by International Overseers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of thousands of Bosnian
Serbs held rallies on Tuesday, protesting against the
international officials' decision to fire Nikola Poplasen as
Bosnian Serb President and to end unilateral Serb control over the
key city of Brcko.
</P>
<P>
The protesters, rallying in the cities of Banija Luka, Pale,
Bileca, Bratunac and Srebrenica, decried the International High
Representative Carlos Wenstendorp and American arbitrator Roberts
Owen as breaching the Dayton peace accord and urged them to back
down on their decisions.
</P>
<P>
President of the Bosnian Presidency Zivko Radisic, Poplasen and
Speaker of the National Assembly of the Republic of Srpska joined
the demonstrations, the Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly of the Republic of Srpska passed a
resolution on March 7, rejecting the two international overseers'
rulings two days earlier as violating the Dayton peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The following day, Wenstendorp refused to accept the Serb
parliament's rejection to his decision to sack Poplasen. He also
appealed to Serb representatives to accept Owen's decision on
setting up a neutral district in Brcko and putting it under joint
Serb, Croat and Muslim administration.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.S. brokered Dayton peace agreement that ended the
1992-1995 Bosnian war, Brcko, a city with a population of 90,000
and a key port on the Sava river, is a Serb entity.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Calls for Commitments to Peace in Southeastern Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian Prime Minister Ivan
Kostov told Parliament Tuesday that Bulgaria expects the
Rambouillet peace deal to restore security and stability in the
region and lead to a strong commitment on the part of the entire
international community to the future of Southeastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
At the request of MPs, Kostov set forth Bulgaria's position on
a solution to the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We expect not only the hostilities to cease, but also a
lasting solution to be found, based on the provisional agreement
backed by the Contact Group and the European Union; a solution
which will stand the test of everyday contacts between the
citizens in Kosovo and in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
regardless of their ethnic origin," the Bulgarian Prime Minister
said.
</P>
<P>
The solution to Kosovo must establish a model of interethnic
relations that would put Yugoslavia back on the map of Europe and
thanks to which the social processes in the neighboring countries
would no longer be held hostage to the existing climate in the
region.
</P>
<P>
"The Bulgarian Government is hopeful about the talks on Kosovo
in France," Kostov said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Bulgaria's support for the presence of
international peacekeeping forces in Kosovo, if the two parties to
the conflict accept the Rambouillet agreement.
</P>
<P>
Kostov confirmed that Bulgaria favors a political solution of
the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
Any military solution resulting from a refusal to accept the
agreement in France will lead to disintegration of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He categorically condemned the violence in Kosovo and argued in
favor of an unconditional restoration of the human rights of
Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he said that the demands for the independence
of Kosovo were unacceptable to Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
"Bulgaria supports the achievement of a peaceful solution by
political means which should guarantee the fundamental rights and
freedoms of all Kosovo residents regardless of their ethnic origin
on the basis of granting a broad autonomy to Kosovo within the
internationally recognized borders of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia and respect for its territorial integrity.

<P>
LONDON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Atletico Madrid spoiled the
Italian hopes of having a record three teams in the UEFA Cup semi-
finals with a rallied 2-1 away victory over nine-man Roma on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Atletico booked their place in the last four 4-2 on aggregate
after Parma handed out a 6-0 drubbing to French league leaders
Girondins for a 7-2 aggregate win. Bologna slipped through 3-2
overall after a 2-0 second leg defeat by Olympique Lyon.
</P>
<P>
Olympique Marseille ended Celta Vigo's giant-killing run by
drawing 0-0 in the second leg in Spain and qualifying 2-1.
</P>
<P>
Roma had Cameroon defender Pierre Woma sent off in the 28th
minute but went 1-0 ahead through striker Marco Delvecchio four
minutes later.
</P>
<P>
Atletico fought back to draw level through Carlos Aguilera in
the 59th minute before Roberto Fresnedoso sent the Spanish side
through with an 89th minute goal.
</P>
<P>
Roma's misery was complete when skipper Francesco Totti was
sent off for a second caution in the 90th minute.
</P>
<P>
Olympique Marseille dashed the hopes of another Spanish team as
they went through thanks to a 2-1 first leg win after forcing out
a goaless tie with Celta Vigo, who had beaten England's Aston
Villa and Liverpool in previous rounds.
</P>
<P>
Parma, who lost their first leg match 1-2 two weeks ago,
completely turned around the table by crushing Bordeaux 6-0 thanks
to their lethal striking partnership Hernan Crespo and Enrico
Chiesa.
</P>
<P>
Argentine Crespo began the demolition of the Girondins in the
37th minute and Italian Chiesa struck in the 43rd for a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Juan Veron joined compatriot Crespo on the
scoresheet in the 48th minute before Crespo and Chiesa contributed
their second apiece in the 59th and 66th minutes.
</P>
<P>
Argentine Abel Balbo converted a penalty to complete the 6-0
rout.
</P>
<P>
Another Italian side Bologna turned in a lacklustre performance
at Olympique Lyon, losing 0-2, but they still went through 3-2 on
aggregate.
</P>
<P>
The draw for the semifinals will be made in Zurich on March 19,
with the ties taking place on April 6 and 20. The final will be
in Moscow on May 12.

<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian Army
denied Tuesday that 73 people had been killed in fighting in the
last few days between paramilitary groups and rebels in a village
in Bolivar province.
</P>
<P>
The claims from the Defense Council on the numbers of fallen
were false, said General Raphael Hernandez Lopez, Chief of the

<P>
CHONGQING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Qijiang County of Chongqing
Municipality in southwest China will build another bridge at a
point about 40 meters from the site of the collapsed Hongqiao
bridge on the Qihe River.
</P>
<P>
The Hongqiao bridge collapsed on January 4 this year, claiming
40 lives.

according to Xu Tingjiang, deputy magistrate of the county.
</P>
<P>
A public bid for the bridge's design will be held on March 20.
Construction of the bridge, connecting a commercial downtown area
and a residential area, is expected to begin in mid-May and be
completed in one year, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
The local government has vowed to give priority to quality in

<HEADLINE> Hungary Concerned Over EU Commissioners' Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Hungary said Tuesday that it is
concerned at the resignation of the entire European Union (EU)
Commission and hoped it would not affect the EU's internal reform
and eastward enlargement.
</P>
<P>
The government of Hungary will study the situation of the EU
after the organization's powerful commission resigned, Foreign
Ministry spokesman Horvath Gabor was quoted by the Hungarian
Telegraph Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Horvath is confident that the EU's work, such as the internal
reform, the agenda of the year 2000 and the negotiations on
candidate countries to join the EU, will be transferred to the
European Parliament and the rotating EU presidency state.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that, according to the agenda, Hungary
will continue its ministerial talks with Germany this June on
joining the EU which holds the bloc's presidency.
</P>
<P>
Hungary's preparation to enter the EU and its agenda will not
be affected by the resignations, Horvath said.
</P>
<P>
The 20 EU commissioners resigned en masse early on Tuesday
morning after a panel of five independent experts appointed by the
European Parliament published a report, accusing them of losing
control over fraud, nepotism and financial mismanagement in their
departments.
</P>
<P>
The resignation came just nine days before an EU summit is due
to open in Berlin to discuss the future of the organization's
financing and the reform of its major policies.

<HEADLINE> Shandong's Coastal Waters Contaminated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Water in inland areas near the
coast of east China's Shandong Province is seriously contaminated,
partly because of the drainage of industrial wastes and domestic
sewage.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey shows that the quality of the water in this
region is acceptable so long as it is about 3,000 meters from the
local coast, but the water closer to the coast is much more highly
polluted.
</P>
<P>
Bays and estuaries where polluted water flows into sea are the
most seriously contaminated.
</P>
<P>
Among the pollutants dumped into this water are mainly from
fertilizers used in agriculture and aqua-culture.
</P>
<P>
Soil erosion and the increasing use of washing detergent are
also among the leading contaminators of the sea waters.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that during the 1989-1997 period, as many as 35
red tides occurred in local inshore sea areas, resulting in more
than one billion yuan in economic losses for the local fishing
industry.
</P>
<P>
Shandong Province has 3,100 kilometers of coastline, fully one-
sixth of China's total.

<HEADLINE> Angry Former Olympians Challenge IOC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Disillusioned over the bribery
scandal of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), a group of
Canadian former Olympians launched on Tuesday in Lausanne an
athletes' coalition to challenge the world governing body of
Olympic sports.
</P>
<P>
Led by 1992 Olympic champion swimmer Mark Tewksbury, OATH (
Olympic Advocates Together Honorably) hopes to help restore the
tarnished Olympic spirit and act as a watchdog over the IOC. IOC
will meet this week in Lausanne to clean house after the biggest
and most damaging bribery scandal in its history.
</P>
<P>
"I have watched with great sadness in the past three months as
the spirit of the Olympics has been betrayed by the actions of the
IOC," Tewksbury, one of the founders of the new council, was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to attack any one individual in the IOC but the
system itself. I no longer believe in it (the IOC). I don't
believe in its leadership," he said.
</P>
<P>
Angered by the corruption scandal, Tewksbury resigned last
month from his posts in the Canadian Olympic Association, the
International Amateur Swimming Federation (FINA) and the Toronto
2008 Olympic bid committee.
</P>
<P>
The group also includes two-time Olympic silver medalist
speedskater Susan Auch, paralympian marathon medalist Andre Viger,
former Olympian rower Heather Clarke and athlete advocate Ann Peel.
</P>
<P>
"It's time for the IOC to change," said OATH co-founder and
Magna vice-president Keith Stein. "It is now time for democracy,
not aristocracy," he said.
</P>
<P>
With own source of funding, OATH wishes to remain independent
from the Olympic movement and, to avoid any possible IOC
interference, it kept itself secret until Tuesday. "We're up
against a pretty big force -- the IOC. We didn't want anything to
undermine this. We wanted to ensure we could get out of the gate,
" said Tewksbury.
</P>
<P>
"We received information of this initiative, which was
apparently secret until now," IOC director general Francois
Carrard said IOC had received information of the group but didn't
understand why it was kept secret. "But we'll certainly give a
look at the project," he said.
</P>
<P>
Spearheaded by Canadians though, OATH hopes to rally athletes
from around the world. And an international symposium has been
planned to be held in June.
</P>
<P>
The group said several other athletes, including American
Olympic champion speedskater Dan Jansen had shown strong interests
on the group.

STOCKHOLM, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Germany booked their semi-final
berth at the Men's Handball World Cup on Tuesday with a 30-27 win
over Russia while co-hosts Norway were ousted after a second
consecutive loss.
</P>
<P>
In the second round of Group B matches held at Drammen, Norway,
Germany continued their winning run at the expense of Russia, who
virtually lost any hopes of entering the last four after tying
their opening match with Egypt.
</P>

Egypt are now well-poised to reach the semi-finals after edging
Norway 22-21, who on Monday went down to Germany 25-22.
</P>
<P>
Co-hosts Sweden failed to secure a semi-final slot after being
forced to a 25-25 draw with Hungary at Goteborg, which left Group
A wide open.
</P>
<P>
Now Sweden are tied with France, 28-18 winners over Iceland on
Tuesday, on the top spot in the group with identical three points
from 1-1 record. Hungary, who will take on Iceland in the last
round of group matches on Wednesday, also has the realistic chance
of advancing after collecting two points from two draws.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Continue Low-Level Flight in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. EA-6B jets would
continue the low-level flight in Italy despite last year's cable
car disaster that killed 20 lives, the head of a U.S. military
team checking new flight safety measures in Italy said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"I think, not only for our country and for the Italians but for
the NATO nations, that low-level flying proficiency is something
we need to maintain," Navy Admiral Joseph Prueher said.
</P>
<P>
Prueher was assigned by Defense Secretary William Cohen to go
to Italy and work closely with the Italian military on new safety
measures after last year's accident in which the U.S. Marine Corps
EA-6B jet severed a cable car cable, sending the cable car
plunging to the ground and killing 20 skiers on it.
</P>
<P>
The pilot of the plane was acquitted of manslaughter and other
serious charges in a military trial in North Carolina this month.
And similar charges were also dropped against the plane's
navigator on Monday.
</P>
<P>
But both men still face trial on obstruction of justice charges.
</P>
<P>
Prueher and Italian Air Force Lt. Gen. Leonardo Tricarico head
a joint team which will look into new safety measures set up for
aircraft at Aviano Air Base, where the EA-6B was based, and at
other military airfields and to see if further measures are needed.

<HEADLINE> New Crops Expected to Raise China's Grain Yield </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- High-yield crops are expected to
boost China's grain output by 4 million tons this year, according
to the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
A ministry official told China Daily that the country will
promote the use of 50 top-quality high-yielding strains of paddy
rice, wheat and corn in more than 6.6 million hectares of farm
land.
</P>
<P>
"The application of Agro-technical skills and service this
year will focus on optimizing the crop-growing structure,
developing high-efficiency agriculture and increasing farmers'
income," said Xu Weisheng, chief of the ministry's National Agro-
Technical Enhancement and service Center (NATESC).
</P>
<P>
"We will set aside an additional 333,300 hectares of crop land
for high-quality early indica rice in the nine provinces of
southern China, increasing the total area for quality early rice
in the region to about 2.7 million hectares," Today's China Daily
quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The plan is expected to increase the region's grain yield by
about 1 million tons, and add 2 billion yuan to local revenues, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the center promoted the planting of 24 high-quality
rice strains and the use of accessory technologies in southern
China, increasing per hectare production by 489 kilograms,
indicate NATESC statistics.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, about 58.3 percent of the acreage for paddy rice,
wheat and corn was planted with improved varieties, according to
Xu.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Rescue Workers Search Wreckage for Dead in Train Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Rescue crews used cranes
Tuesday to move mangled, smoldering pieces of metal as they
searched for victims of the United States' worst train wreck since
1993 -- a fiery collision with a truck loaded with steel bars in
Illinois State of the country Monday night, reports reaching here
said.
</P>
<P>
At least 14 people were killed and 119 others injured.
</P>
<P>
The train was bound for New Orleans City of Louisiana State
from Chicago. As many as 216 people were aboard the train when it
hit the tractor-trailer at a rural crossing near a steel mill 90
kilometers south of Chicago. Four to six people were still
missing and feared dead in the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
The collision left the train's two engines and leading cars
scattered like burned and broken toys. One engine punched through
a car behind it, and the crash sparked a fire that burned for more
than five hours.
</P>
<P>
All of the dead were found in a double-deck sleeping car that
was three cars behind the engines of the 14-car train. Many
passengers were settling in for the night when the train slammed
into the truck shortly after 9:30 p.m. (local time) Monday.
</P>
<P>
The crossing was protected by gates and lights that appear to
have been functioning at the time of the crash, according to David
Farrell, a spokesman for the Illinois Commerce Commission.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, John R. Stokes, the driver of the truck, said that
he didn't see the train as he approached the tracks and that the
lights started flashing after he had started driving across.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President Carlos
Menem on Tuesday accepted opposition challenges to call a national
referendum on whether he can run for a third term in the October
general election.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the headquarters of the Mechanics Union in the
capital city, the president said he would hold a plebiscite if its
outcome was legally binding and would override a constitutional
ban on presidents serving three consecutive terms.
</P>
<P>
The request to hold a referendum, raised last week by the
opposing alliance, was intended to stop the possibility that Menem
would run for a third consecutive term as the country's chief
leader.
</P>
<P>
The 68-year-old president was elected in 1989 and re-elected in
1995, after striking a deal with the opposition to change the
constitution to allow him to run for a second term.
</P>
<P>
The constitution now forbids three consecutive terms. Menem has
not yet said publicly that he wants to run for the presidency for
the third time in October.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Shenyang, capital of northeast
China's Liaoning Province, scored an increase of 45 percent in its
import and export volume in the first month of this year.
</P>
<P>
Information from Shenyang Customs Office said the city's
foreign trade volume in January stood at 120 million U.S. dollars,
up 45 percent according to comparable figure of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Breaking down the figures, imports were 73.73 million U.S.
dollars, up 60 percent, while exports were 46.37 million U.S.
dollars, a rise of 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
A local foreign trade official said Shenyang had negative
growth in foreign trade in a period last year due to the adverse
impact of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
But the city adjusted commodity structure for foreign trade,
while making efforts to export new foreign trade markets in
regions including West Europe, which has proved effective, said
the official.
</P>
<P>
China faces great difficulties in its foreign trade and
economic cooperation in the new year, but Chinese foreign trade
Minister Shi Guangsheng pledged that China would make great
efforts to increase foreign trade and achieve a balance between
imports and exports in 1999 following a 15-year-low decrease in
trade volume in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Hit by the Asian financial crisis, China's foreign trade
dropped 0.4 percent in 1998 to reach 323.93 billion US dollars,
the first year of negative growth since 1983.

<P>
SINGAPORE, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's first national
conference on women and sport closed here on Tuesday after
endorsing a draft resolution calling for more women's involvement
in sports.
</P>
<P>
The Women and Sport Conference 1999, themed "Women and Sport:
New Horizons", is aimed at "increasing the participation of women
and girls in sports in Singapore at all levels and in all
functions and roles", according to the resolution.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day session, sports officials, staff of local
schools, visiting foreign scholars and students discussed
solutions to the barriers which keep women away from sports in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Only 28 percent of the country's women participated regularly
in sports in 1997, compared to 40 percent of males, according to a
recent survey.
</P>
<P>
The resolution called for women's equity in sport, more
accessibility of facilities for women and more sporting education
available.

<HEADLINE> Street Galleries Popular in East China's City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, March 17 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese customer who bought a
replica of Vincent Van Gogh's painting "Sunflowers" at a local
gallery says he's happy with it because he can enjoy art at a
relatively small cost.
</P>
<P>
There are many of these customers at the city's galleries,
which have grown with the demand. There are about 200 of them in
Qingdao, in Shandong Province, mostly selling Chinese water colors
and a few prints and oil paintings.
</P>
<P>
Many of their owners are painters who are known around Shandong.
One says that most of his patrons were intellectuals in the past
but that now his customers represent a broader spectrum of city
life.
</P>
<P>
Their purchases seem to be mostly for decorating apartments or
houses. There are very few buyers who are serious collectors.
</P>
<P>
Qingdao people prefer traditional Chinese paintings, says Xu
Xiuwu, the vice-president of the Arts Association of Qingdao, and
framed pictures are gaining in popularity while scrolls are
declining.
</P>
<P>
However, Xu says, galleries operate on a rather low level and
need to embrace the artist, agent, and critic all together and to
make a greater effort to increase artistic awareness in customers.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Italy's 1999 Budget Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Italy's target of cutting budget
deficit to 2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) by the end of
this year is feasible, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said
Tuesday at the end of an annual mission here.
</P>
<P>
The IMF team, which started an inspection on Italy's poor
economic conditions on March 3, said in its report that the
country's economic growth would be between 1 and 2 percent this
year, below the European Union (EU) average.
</P>
<P>
Italy has made great strides in entering the euro zone but more
structural reforms are needed if it is to maintain competitiveness
with its partners, the IMF added.
</P>
<P>
The IMF also backed Italy's goal of reducing budget deficit to
1 percent of GDP by 2001 and balancing the budget the year after.
But it stressed that "this can only be seen as a minimal goal."
</P>
<P>
The report praised measures taken to liberalize the labor
market, reiterated its criticism of a proposed 35-hour working
week, and called for further moves to deregulate the economy.
</P>
<P>
In a formal reply to the report, the Italian Ministry of
Treasury issued a statement Tuesday evening, saying it "accepts
the invitation to consolidate the work of deficit-cutting and to
complete the reform of the Italian economy."

<HEADLINE> Non-Public Sector in Shaanxi Grows Rapidly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Shaanxi Province
ranks first in the country in the growth of the non-public sector
over the past year.
</P>
<P>
To date, individually-owned businesses in the province number
765,000, up 22.7 percent from the figure a year ago, and the
number of private firms surged 40.7 percent to 34,000.
</P>
<P>
The output value generated by the non-public sector in its
gross domestic product has risen from 11.8 percent to 18 percent,
said Jia Zhibang, vice governor of Shaanxi.
</P>
<P>
Some 10 percent of the province's revenue came from the non-
public sector last year, with the figure standing at 40 percent in
some counties.
</P>
<P>
Individual or self-employed firms provide 95 percent of the non-
staple food to the residents of medium and large cities in Shaanxi.
</P>
<P>
Jia named rapid growth and the rational development of industry
as the major characteristics of the non-public sector.
</P>
<P>
The number of newly registered non-public firms in 1998 was 44
percent of all such firms existing there in the previous 20 years,
and their combined registered capital was 73 percent of the total
amount for the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Jia attributes the rapid growth of the non-public sector to
simplified registration procedures, preferential treatment in
taxation and loans, and curbs on the arbitrary collection of fines
and fees.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Hails Oil Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, March 16 (Xinhua) -- A new agreement between producers
to rescue depressed oil prices will help Venezuela avoid shutting
down a third of the country's oil wells, Venezuela's Energy and
Mines Minister Ali Rodriguez said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela, Iran, Algeria, Saudi Arabia and Mexico agreed on
March 12 to cut oil production to less than 2 million barrels a
day (Bpd) as of April. Norway, Oman and Russia joined the
agreement this week.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said at a press conference that if there had been no
agreement on an additional cut, oil prices would have fallen to
below 6 U.S. dollars a barrel, which would have obligated the
Venezuelan Petroleum company to close a third of the oil wells
because of the high cost of production.
</P>
<P>
The oil producing countries have agreed on a global oil
production cut of five million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said that because of production reductions, the price
of Brent crude may reach 18 dollars a barrel by the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
In two days the Venezuelan basket has risen 39 cents to 10.30
dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan export basket, which is made up of crude and
refined products, fell to a minimum of 7.76 dollars per barrel
last month and, according to Rodriguez, could have fallen below 7
dollars this quarter.
</P>
<P>
Though Rodriguez declined to reveal the total amount of the
Venezuelan cut under the agreement, delegates from the
Organization of Oil Producing Countries told the local press that
the South American country would reduce production by 125,000
barrels daily.

<HEADLINE> Hoddle: I Still Pinch Myself About England Sacking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Former England mananger Glenn
Hoddle still has to pinch himself six weeks after being sacked
from the office.
</P>
<P>
The 40-year-old former national boss was relieved of his duties
last month following his reported comments on the disabled and
reincarnation.
</P>
<P>
"I pinch myself sometimes and think I should still be going
into the office and should still be preparing for the France game,
" said Hoddle.
</P>
<P>
"Every now and again it hits you. If we'd lost three games on
the trot and I got the sack...c'est la vie, that's life and that's
the football life.
</P>
<P>
"But it's not and that's what is so sad about the case," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Hoddle still feels his comments, reported in an interview with
The Times newspaper, were misinterpreted.
</P>
<P>
"I must get people to understand that what I actually ended up
getting the sack about, the punishment for disabled people from
other lifetimes - it's not my belief and it's not what I said.
</P>
<P>
"I think we have the choice to come back into whatever
circumstances in the next lifetime. I would never dream of saying
that there's a punishment bestowed upon people who are disabled,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Hoddle also defended his World Cup diary, co-written with the
Football Association's acting executive director David Davies,
which was seen by his critics as a factor in his eventual
departure.
</P>
<P>
"If it was the most boring book ever written, about how we ate
eggs for breakfast and had coffee before we went to bed, they
would still have ripped it apart, but you don't let those sort of
people dictate your life," he added.

<HEADLINE> Maloney: Lewis Would Have Beaten Ali </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Lennox Lewis' manager Frank
Maloney claimed that his fighter would have even beaten Muhammad
Ali.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports on Tuesday, Maloney described Lewis
as the "best finisher in the heavyweight division" and claimed
that Ali, widely considered the greatest of all time, would have
been outmuscled by the bigger man.
</P>
<P>
Maloney said: "We have to progress and times change. I believe
boxing is as good as it was in the 70s. It may not have the same
charisma as a Muhammad Ali. Lennox Lewis would have beaten
Muhammad Ali. Muhammad Ali was too small to compete against
today's modern heavyweights."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Maloney has ruled out the prospect of his fighter
meeting Evander Holyfield at Wembley in a world heavyweight title
rematch.
</P>
<P>
Wembley has been mentioned as a possible venue for the two men
to decide the undisputed world championship.
</P>
<P>
But Maloney admitted that Wembley, which is being rebuilt next
year, is not a realistic venue for Lewis and Holyfield to settle
their differences after the controversial draw in New York over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Lewis' camp want the return to be at an alternative British
venue and Maloney urged Sports Minister Tony Banks to offer his
support to make it happen.
</P>
<P>
"We have been told it (the rematch) can't be at Wembley because
obviously American television do control the situation. It's
American TV that have the main contracts," said Maloney.
</P>
<P>
"We believe it can come here - not to Wembley - but to
somewhere in Britain if we can match the same sort of money that
is put up by the Americans.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that maybe Tony Banks will intervene and get the
private sector involved. He has talked about bringing the big
sporting events to this country. We can sit down and talk and
find a way to do this," he added.

<HEADLINE> Wembley Tipped for Boxing Rematch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Plans have been launched to bring
an Evander Holyfield-Lennox Lewis boxing rematch to Wembley
stadium.
</P>
<P>
The Lewis camp are hoping a second world heavyweight
unification bout - following Saturday's controversial draw - can
be brought across the Atlantic to Britain.
</P>
<P>
The fight continues to divide opinion in the boxing world, with
Lewis' manager Frank Maloney calling for the American judge who
awarded the fight to Holyfield to consider her position.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, New York state has launched three separate inquiries
into the outcome of the fight, which most observers say was
dominated by Lewis.
</P>
<P>
"The result has done more harm for boxing than boxing has ever
done itself before," fumed Maloney, on arriving back in Britain on
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Panos Eliades, Lewis' promoter, has challenged Holyfield to put
his WBA and IBF belts on the line again - this time in London,
rather than New York.
</P>
<P>
"We would love to have a rematch in Britain. We could fill
Wembley Stadium three times over," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Lennox wants the three belts and he's looking forward to a
rematch. My only worry is whether Evander Holyfield will want to
fight him again. He may not want to get back in the ring with him.
"
</P>
<P>
According to local reports, dates in early July or August had
been set aside for the rematch, which would be the national
stadium's last major sporting event before redevelopment.
</P>
<P>
And Martin Corry, spokesman for Wembley, welcomed the plan to
bring the fight to north London.
</P>
<P>
"We would absolutely love to stage it," he said. "There's an
awful lot of talking to be done, but we're looking forward to
talking to Panos and Frank Maloney," he said.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Says No Different Monetary Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan said Tuesday that it has no different monetary
policies for different Fed Districts as was the case in the very
early years.
</P>
<P>
In today's integrated national markets, he said, "monetary
policy decisions, of course, must be directed toward what is
deemed to be the best path for the economy as a whole".
</P>
<P>
Greenspan devoted a speech mainly on U.S. farming in San
Francisco to what he called "one of the more notable soft spots"
in a U.S. economy he termed both impressive and robust.
</P>
<P>
"We at the Federal Reserve are often asked by representatives
of troubled sectors of the economy whether their voices truly are
heard in our policy proceedings", he said, "I can assure you that
they are, most notably in the reports on regional economic
conditions that are a regular part of the preparations for the
meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee and in reports from
Reserve Bank presidents that are a regular part of the policy
discussions themselves."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Fed's responsibility on monitoring the
safety and soundness of the banking system required them to seek
better understanding of the regional and sectoral composition of
changes in prices and activity and of their effects on finance.
</P>
<P>
"Among other things", he added,"We have devoted special
attention over the years to the collection and interpretation of
data from community banks that are heavily involved in
agricultural lending, a sector of the economy in which these
smaller banks still appear to have a strong comparative
advantage."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Adopts New System of Classifying Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government has
introduced a new business classification system which recognizes
such features of modern life as the fact that computers run on
electricity, government officials said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The North American Industry Classification System, replacing
the six-decade-old Standard Industry Classification system, will
allow the government to separately track such new businesses as
fiber-optic cable manufacturing, cellular telephone service, and
telemarketing.
</P>
<P>
Previously, service-industry data on haircuts and brain surgery
were all dropped in the same statistical pot while computers were
counted in nonelectrical machinery because the first computers
were likened to adding machines, and adding machines are
hand-cranked, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The new system provides 1,170 industry classifications, 15
percent more than the old system. It includes 358 new industries,
390 revised classifications and 422 industries that will be
measured the same way as before.
</P>
<P>
Users of government statistics received their first glimpse of
the new system on Tuesday in the Census Bureau's advance report on
the 1997 Economic Census. It revealed, for instance, that the
information sector -- movies, broadcasting, telecommunications,
data-processing -- provided 3.2 million jobs at 115,000 locations
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The new system was jointly developed with Canada and Mexico and
will make comparisons among the signatories of the North American
Free Trade Agreement easier, the officials said.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Announces Debarment of Canadian Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- In its effort to eliminate
fraud and corruption, the World Bank declared on Tuesday that
Canadax Technologies Inc., a Canadian firm, and its president,
Pierre Savignac, permanently ineligible to be awarded any
contracts financed by the bank.
</P>
<P>
The sanction was imposed after the bank concluded that Canadax
engaged in fraudulent conduct during the procurement of a World
Bank-financed contract in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
"When contractors fail to observe the highest of ethical
standards during the bidding process, as happened in this
instance, we will debar bidders, suppliers, contractors or
consultants from bidding an Bank-financed contracts. In this case,
we concluded that permanent debarment was clearly warranted," said
James D. Wolfensohn, president of the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The bank's Sanctions Committee found that the Canadax case
involved the forgery of two letters of credit. Canadax submitted
the letters as bid and performance securities in the context of
the bidding for, and the award of, a World Bank-financed contract
for the supply of computers to the Ministry of Culture and
Education in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
The committee agreed on the recommendation against Canadax after
reviewing a report prepared by the bank's Internal Auditing
Department and a response submitted by the accused firm in which
Savignac denied any direct responsibility for the forgeries.
</P>
<P>
Since the Sanctions Committee was set up in November 1998, four
cases have been submitted for review. the present case is the
first to result in a recommendation to the president of the
bank.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Satisfied with Bougaville Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
on Tuesday voiced its satisfaction with the unfolding peace
process over Papua New Guinea's secession-troubled island of
Bougainville.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the press here, the president of the
15-member of the Security Council, Qin Huasun of China, said,
"Members of the Council express their satisfaction with the smooth
development of the peace process and the upholding of the ceasefire
by the parties concerned."
</P>
<P>
The statement came after the Security Council was briefed by
the U.N. Secretariat on the latest development of the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Council members also expressed their hope the parties would
continue their efforts to establish a reconciliation government in
Bougainville in accordance with an agreement signed in 1998, said
Qin, who is Chinese permanent representative to the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
The 15 Council members also hoped that the disarmament process
could be accelerated, he said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed at Lincoln University, New Zealand,
sought to end a 10-year secessionist rebellion in which up to
20,000 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
An election is to be held on Bougainville next month. Voters
will choose representatives who will negotiate with the Papua New
Guinea government until a reconciliation government is established
on Bougainville later in the year.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder, Blair Trying to Hunt for New EU Boss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- British and German leaders on
Tuesday agreed that the European Union will try to name a new
president for the European Commission at next week's Berlin
Summit.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair and Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder made
the announcement at Blair's Downing Street residence in London
after holding talks.
</P>
<P>
"We recognize that the situation has changed dramatically and
we have to act," Blair told a joint news conference.
</P>
<P>
"We have obviously had a long and detailed discussion about the
committee. We agreed there are certain actions it is necessary to
take as swiftly as possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the British leader told parliament before meeting
Schroeder that Santer should leave his caretaker post as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
"We have to find a new Commission president quickly, without
putting ourselves under unnecessary pressure," Schroeder told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
"We will certainly discuss it in Berlin. We will discuss a
procedure and perhaps a suggested candidate," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Schroeder admitted that a second informal summit might be
needed after Berlin to finalise the choice of a new president for
the European Commission.
</P>
<P>
The German Chancellor said Santer's successor would have to
possess political experience, economic knowledge, administrative
experience and absolute integrity.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Blair confirmed that the two heads of
government discussed the names of possible successors to Santer
but declined to give details.
</P>
<P>
But he said the new candidate would ideally serve out the
remainder of Santer's term and then be reappointed for a further
five years.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder arrived London Tuesday afternoon in his rush visit to
EU capitals to prepare for the Berlin meeting.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says not Optimistic on Kosovo Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Tuesday it was not optimistic about Kosovo peace talks now under
way in Paris and urged Serbian negotiators to agree quickly to a
peace deal imposed by so-called six-nation Contact Group.
</P>
<P>
"There is not a lot of reason for optimism coming from the
Serb side," State Department spokesman James Rubin told
reporters. "Time and patience are clearly running out."
</P>
<P>
Serbian President Milan Milutinovic said on Tuesday his side
was ready to sign the proposed peace deal -- but only the
political part of that, and only "under the precondition that
they accept all or our complaints." He did not detail the
complaints.
</P>
<P>
As for a NATO military force in the Yugoslav province ,
Milutinovic said: "We reject it."
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group was putting more pressure on Belgrade to
match the ethnic Albanian delegation by accepting the peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Rubin noted that a NATO threat to attack Serb forces from the
air has been in force since the end of January, if they reject
the Contact Group peace deal.
</P>
<P>
"In the meanwhile, we are focusing our attention on making
the Serbs understand that they don't have a choice, that their
only choice is to negotiate seriously," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The only rational choice for the people of Serbia is to
resolve this conflict before it gets worse, before additional
resources and additional lives are lost on the Serb side in
Kosovo," he added.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Says Serbs Move Troops to Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Tuesday that the Yugoslav military had moved more than 30,000
Serbian troops into and near Kosovo in preparation for any NATO
encroachment into its sovereign territory.
</P>
<P>
"They certainly are bracing for war, but they continue to
participate in the talks" in Paris, Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said 14,000 to 18,000 Yugoslav troops were in Kosovo and
another 16,000 to 21,000 were now gathered around the edge of
the province.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav has said it agreed to settle the conflict in Kosovo
through political way, but flatly rejected any attempt of
deploying NATO troops in the province under the name of
enforcing peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
"It may be that they are trying to build up forces either to
discourage NATO forces from going into Kosovo or to oppose the
NATO move into Kosovo, or to repress further the Albanians,"
Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
He also said the Serb military was shifting anti-aircraft
missiles and guns around to make them less vulnerable to
threatened NATO air strikes.

<HEADLINE> Economic Collapse Is Romania's Main Risk: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The main risk Romania faced
with nowadays is the collapse of the national economy, rather than
a foreign military invasion, Romanian President Emil
Constantinescu stressed here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The President made the remark in an address to the opening
session of a scientific conference on the country's national
interest and the security policy.
</P>
<P>
"At this moment, the danger of a military confrontation is
dwarfed by the threat of being defeated economically," he said,
adding that the corruption, the secondary financial markets, the
organized crime and the terrorism are also among the true risks
and contemporary threats posed on the national security.
</P>
<P>
"Many time from now, the big perils will relate to the
off-balanced financial-banking institutions and social relations,
the rate of the corruption and the organized crime," he said.
</P>
<P>
After 1990, Romania was destitute of any collective security
arrangement. A reason why it has been and it still is imperative
that Romania should become a NATO member, he said.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that the Romanian society does not see the
adherence to the NATO chiefly as a protection against some threat,
but as the regaining of an identity deprived for some good
decades. "The NATO does not account for a shelter to us, but for a
community of values," Constantinescu said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Creditors to Forgive African Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
proposed on Tuesday an initiative urging creditors to forgive 70
billion U.S. dollars in debt mostly for African countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening plenary of a U.S.-Africa ministerial
meeting at the State Department, the president said "today I ask
the international community to take actions which could result in
forgiving 70 billion dollars in global debt."
</P>
<P>
"What I am proposing is debt reduction that is deeper and
faster," Clinton told the ministers from 50 African countries.
</P>
<P>
In consultation with Congress, Clinton proposed making
significant improvements to an initiative by heavily indebted poor
countries at the G7 summit in Cologne, Germany, in June.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to ensure that no country committed to fundamental
reform is left with a debt burden that keeps it from meeting its
people's basic human needs and spurring growth," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he would work with G7 colleagues on a plan for
"complete forgiveness" of bilateral concessional loans, rather
than rescheduling as is done at present, and forgiveness of up to
90 percent of bilateral non-concessional debt.
</P>
<P>
He said his government would support gold sales by the
International Monetary Fund to do its part and additional
contributions by the United States and other countries to the
World Bank's Trust Fund to help meet the cost of the initiative.
</P>
<P>
To avoid recurring debt problems, Clinton said donor countries
should commit to provide at least 90 percent of new development
assistance to countries eligible for debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
He said a new approach should also be taken toward countries
emerging from conflicts that had not had the chance to establish
reform records and needed immediate relief and concessional
financing.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said in his budget request for the 2000 fiscal year he
had asked for 237 million dollars for relief of African debt on
top of the 245 million dollars covered in this year's
appropriation.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan: U.S. Farming Benefits When World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. farming as a whole
appears well-positioned to benefit when Asian and other economies
around the world begin to recover, though farmers are suffering
from sharply falling prices for their products, Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Farmers, rather than sharing in the general prosperity, have
been experiencing disappointing exports and sharply falling
prices" during "what presumably is a transitory period of
softness," Greenspan said in a speech prepared for delivery to the
Independent Bankers Association of America in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
He said prices received by farmers are down 5 percent from a
year ago and prices for corn, soybeans, wheat and hogs have hit
levels unseen in years, principally blaming the worldwide
financial crisis that began in Asia in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Falling shipments to the Asian countries accounted for more
than 80 percent of the drop in the value of farm exports over the
past two years," he said, adding that shipments to Russia and
South America also have been affected.
</P>
<P>
The strong domestic economy hasn't made up for the loss of
exports, because "consumers, especially in affluent economies, do
not boost spending on food to nearly the same degree that their
incomes rise," he said amid some upbeat economic signs, including
the Dow Jones industrial average cracking the 10,000 barrier for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly our farm sector stands to gain, perhaps appreciably,
when more favorable economic conditions finally emerge" around the
world, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, farmers have responded "by reducing the costs of
production to the bare bone." And they've been helped by falling
prices for gasoline, diesel fuel and fertilizer, which helped
produce a 3 percent drop in prices farmers pay for goods, and by
past technological innovations that have made farmers more
efficient, and by increased government support payments.
</P>
<P>
"The weakening of farm markets, while pressuring farm income
and wealth, has not had effects as dramatic as the declines in
market prices might seem to have implied," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Despite heightened anxieties about how long the present
slack conditions in farm markets might persist, both farmers and
lenders appear to retain a fair degree of optimism about the
longer-run prospects for the sector," he said. "However, the
near-term may be challenging."

<HEADLINE> World Bank Finances Container Transport Project in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved
Tuesday a loan of 71 million U.S. dollars for China's container
transport project, which will facilitate the inland movement of
seaborne containers from gateway ports to inland cities.
</P>
<P>
This project will help alleviate infrastructure bottlenecks in
China by developing an inland distribution system for seaborne
containers and improving service quality of the container inland
distribution market, the bank said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The project was designed to introduce effective competition in
container distribution markets by instituting intra-port
competition in Tianjin Port and enabling newly-created inland
container depot operators to offer alternative service options to
compete with large state-owned freight forwarders, according to
the bank.
</P>
<P>
It was also designed to advance enterprise reform through
facilitating project entities to transform themselves into
commercially-oriented enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The project will benefit, primarily, project provinces,
including land-locked provinces such as Inner Mongolia. These
beneficiaries will have better and more reliable access to foreign
markets. The establishment of shipping links to seaports will also
increase the attractiveness of these provinces as potential sites
for foreign direct investments.
</P>
<P>
Another group of beneficiaries will be foreign shipping lines
and freight forwarders as the policy reforms will contribute to
the creation of a more competitive business environment in China's
transportation sector.
</P>
<P>
The loan is at the World Bank's standard interest rate for
LIBOR-based U.S. dollar single-currency loans, with a maturity of
20 years, including a five-year grace period.

<HEADLINE> Mowlam Calls Killed Lawyer "Brave Woman" for Ulster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Northern Ireland
secretary on Tuesday called Rosemary Nelson, a Roman Catholic
lawyer killed by a car bomb on Monday in Northern Ireland, "a
brave woman" for a peaceful settlement of that violence-ridden
province.
</P>
<P>
She was "a brave woman who stood up for what she believed in
and carried those beliefs through into her work," Mo Mowlam said
in a speech when she came to the United States to accept an award
from the New England Global Citizens' Circle.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam said the killers of lawyer Nelson intended to destroy
the peace process in Northern Ireland. "They will not succeed,"
she said. An outlaw pro-British group, the Red Hand Defenders,
claimed responsibility for the killing, which sent shock waves
through the province.
</P>
<P>
Irish politics has moved to Washington in readiness for a
White House bash on St Patrick's Day and several of the key
players are already in Washington for politicking and
socializing -- part of an annual ritual that has expanded under
U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
By the time of the White House and Irish embassy St Patrick's
Day receptions on Wednesday, Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern,
Mo Mowlam, the British Northern Ireland secretary, Protestant leader
of Ulster Unionist Party and first minister-designate of the new
executive David Trimble and Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams would all
be in the U.S. capital.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the gathering is to try to break the deadlock in
Northern Ireland. But analysts here say it looks unlikely for
that as Protestant parties resist the province's absorption into
Ireland while Republicans demand an end to British rule in
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
And the Irish Republican Army refuses to begin disarming,
which has thus prevented its political wing, Sinn Fein, from
taking part in a power-sharing executive to run the province.
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt we are within a hair's breadth of a
settlement and it would be a tragedy if what we have is thrown
away in the next three weeks," Mowlam told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Trimble and Adams are expected to meet in Washington on
Wednesday morning. And there also will be a brief session between
the Northern Ireland politicians and Clinton. But diplomats did
not expect substantive negotiations at that meeting or that brief
session. They hoped U.S pressure might spur the parties toward
compromise and to find new ideas.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 16 (Xinhua) -- China on Tuesday called on
all Member States to fulfill their financial obligations to the
United Nations in full, on time and without conditions.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Fifth Committee (Administrative and Budgetary)
which was considering how to improve the financial situation of
the Organization, Chinese delegate Zhang Wanhai said that he was
pleased that the financial situation of the Organization had
improved, but it was only a very small margin.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said the largest contributor was still in arrears and the
regular budget was still borrowing from peacekeeping accounts, and
the amount owed by the United Nations to troop-contributing
countries was still very large.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis faced by the United Nations was not
related to the scale of assessments, which was agreed to by all
Member States, said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said it was common knowledge that China had been
devastated by floods, but it had made an effort to fulfill its
financial obligations to United Nations and it paid its
assessments in full and earlier than in the past.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that on the eve of the millennium, all
Member States, especially the largest contributor, would fulfill
their financial obligations to the organization in full, on time
and without conditions.

<HEADLINE> IMF Mulls Resumption of Financial Assistance for Ukraine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) announced Tuesday that its management has decided to
propose to the executive board to resume financial assistance for
Ukraine as the government has made progress in the fiscal and
structural areas.
</P>
<P>
A board meeting will be scheduled before the end of March to
consider this issue, the IMF said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The IMF approved last September a three-year extended
arrangement for Ukraine, equivalent to 2.25 billion U.S. dollars,
to support the government's 1998-2001 economic program. Of the
total, 300 million dollars has already been disbursed.
</P>
<P>
"Further disbursements were postponed because cash revenues
fell short of expectations, fiscal prospects for 1999 remained
unclear, and some structural reforms were behind schedule," the
IMF said.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Ukrainian government has embarked upon a major
fiscal adjustment effort, aimed at reducing the overall cash
deficit from the equivalent of 2.7 percent of the gross domestic
product in 1998 to 1 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
As a result, cash revenue performance and expenditure controls
have improved and expenditures have been maintained within the
government's targets, the IMF said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Europe's main stock markets had a
mixed day, although the shocking mass resignation of the European
Union executive body appears to have played little part.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 finished flat after modest mid-session gains
were wiped out by Wall Street's rapid retreat from record highs of
10001.78.
</P>
<P>
The index closed down 4.9 points at 6201.9, having peaked at
6269.6 in early trade.
</P>
<P>
U.S. movements were the controlling factor in a rather subdued
London market, said a chief dealer at a European bank.
</P>
<P>
"The Dow Jones may well set another record later in the
session, but the fact that it only spent a minute or so above
10000 took the steam out of the FTSE," he said.
</P>
<P>
German shares ended higher but failed to gain momentum from
Wall Street's early gains. The Xetra DAX index rose 47.70 points,
or 1 percent, to 5090.93.
</P>
<P>
Trader said the German market did not react to the Dow Jones
climbing briefly above 10000 points given last week's sharp gains.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the CAC 40 index was boosted by a rally in banking
shares, which saw the blue-chip index move into the black in
afternoon trading to close just over 1 point higher at 4186.35.

UNITED NATIONS, March 16 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela's upcoming visit to Libya is a move in support of
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's ongoing efforts to bring to
closure the Lockerbie problem, a U.N. spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard, in answer to a press question,
told a news briefing, "President Mandela's trip to Libya is done
in coordination with the Secretary-General and in support of the
Secretary-General's ongong efforts to bring to closure this matter

</P>
<P>
Mandela will meet Libyan leader Muammar Gadaffi in the Libyan
capital of Tripoli Friday to discuss the latest development in the
Lockerbie bombing affair, reports said.
</P>
<P>
"The president and Colonel Gadaffi are in constant contact.
This is just part of their consultations on a huge range of
issues, and obviously Lockerbie is one of those," a South African
presidential spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela has been at the heart of efforts to break the deadlock
over two Libyans suspected of planting the bomb that blew up a Pan
Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988, killing
270 people.
</P>
<P>
Gadaffi said earlier this month he expected a final agreement
to be achieved, concerned with the handover of the two suspects
for the trial before a Scottish court in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
At present, Annan is waiting for official words from Tripoli on
its decision to surrender the two suspects for the trial, a
central issue in the Lockerbie problem.
</P>
<P>
In August last year, Libya accepted a U.S.-UK offer to have the
two suspects tried before a Scottish court under the Scottish law,
sitting in the Netherlands.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says DPRK Agrees to Access to Kumchang-ri Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States announced
Tuesday that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) had
agreed to allow access to an underground site which Washington
suspected was part of a nuclear project.
</P>
<P>
"An agreement has been struck in New York with the North
Koreans on access to the suspect underground site at Kumchang-ri,"
State Department spokesman James Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said the agreement would allow an unlimited number of visits
to the entire site, with the first visit to take place in May this
year.
</P>
<P>
He added that the second visit could take place in May 2000 and
that the visits would "enable us to confirm and monitor current
and future use of the suspect site."
</P>
<P>
Rubin said Washington did not agree to DPRK demands for
compensation for the access, but that it agreed to take part in a
bilateral agricultural scheme to improve potato production.
</P>
<P>
He said the bilateral agricultural scheme was a "very modest
potato project," which would be carried out by a private voluntary
organization. He added that it was the type of project Washington
had always envisaged under a 1994 bilateral agreement.
</P>
<P>
He said there would be a further round of talks between the two
countries on U.S. concerns over the DPRK's missile production and
sales in Pyongyang on March 29.
</P>
<P>
The agreement on Kumchang-ri, reached in New York and approved
by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, followed four rounds of
talks between U.S. and DPRK officials.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said there would be a further round of talks on March 29
between the two countries on what U.S. alleged was the DPRK's
missile production and sale.
</P>
<P>
last Friday, Pyongyang accused Washington of trying to press
for military dominance of Asia.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. is mistaken if it thinks that it can `check' the DPRK
missile development through `cooperation' with other countries,
and it should not dream that kind of dream," a Foreign Ministry
spokesman said in a report carried by the Korean Central News
Agency.

<HEADLINE> UN Borrows Less From Peacekeeping Funds to Cover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Addressing the Fifth Committee (Administration and Budget),
U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Management Joseph Connor said
those changes were due mainly to increased payments by the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Connor said While the country had contributed an amount
exceeding its assessed contribution for 1998, the amount it still
owed represented 76 percent of all unpaid regular budget
assessments at the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the level of unpaid regular budget assessments was
decreasing substantially, said Connor, adding in 1995, unpaid regular
budget assessments have been 564 million U.S. dollars while at
the end of 1998, they came to 417 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The deficit in the regular budget cash was down, too, and at
the end of 1995, the regular budget cash position had been
negative 195 million dollars, but at the end of 1998, the
deficit was 40 million dollars, Connor said.
</P>
<P>
"We have no capital, we have no reserves, we borrow from
some Member States to make up for the income we do not get from
other Member States," Connor said.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations owed Member States 872 million U.S. dollars
for troops and contingent-owned equipment at the end of 1998 --
virtually the same as 1997 and 1996. Without significant payment
of arrears, that debt would remain intractable," he added.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll in U.S. Train Accident Rises to 13 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- At least 13 people were killed
and five others were missing and feared dead in Monday's train
derailment at a crossing in Illinois State of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Rescue crews were still combing through a twisted, charred rail
car Tuesday, with hopes fading of finding survivors after a train
struck a truck and derailed, said reports reaching here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 people were reportedly injured in the accident.
</P>
<P>
"To find survivors in the wreckage would be pretty unlikely,"
Bourbonnais Fire Chief Mike Harshbarger said.
</P>
<P>
The train, bound from Chicago to New Orleans, careened off the
tracks shortly after 9:30 p.m. Monday (local time) when it slammed
into a semitrailer loaded with heavy steel bars at a crossing 90
kilometers south of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
All of the dead were aboard one sleeper car near the front of
the train. As the impact sent engines and cars flying, it was
pierced by one of the engines and then set afire by leaking diesel
fuel.
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers were digging by hand through debris in that car
Tuesday morning, Harshbarger said. The double-deck sleeper car was
broken in the middle, and much of it had been damaged by fire.
</P>
<P>
In all, local officials said, there were 196 regular
passengers, 18 crew members on duty and two off-duty employees
aboard the train, for a total of 216.
</P>
<P>
The number of dead, accounted-for and unaccounted-for given
earlier by authorities at the scene, totaled 214. There was no
immediate explanation for the discrepancy, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Some 100 were injured enough to be taken to hospitals. At least
11 were listed in critical condition Tuesday and 19 were in serious
condition.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Calls Iraq's flight of Pilgrims "Cynical Ploy" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Tuesday
called Iraqi pilgrim flight to Saudi Arabia "cynical ploy" but
assured pilgrims that they would not be the target of the
Western patrolling planes over no-fly zones.
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi plane carrying 110 muslim pilgrims landed in the
western Saudi city of Jeddah on Tuesday in defiance of a U.N.
air embargo and of the U.S.-British-imposed no-fly zones which Iraq
has denounced since last December as flagrant encroachment of
its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
But State Department spokesman James Rubin said the flight
violated U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line here is Saddam Hussein has found another
cynical ploy and tried to exploit the hajj for his own purposes.
And all he's done is harm himself further internationally by
this violation of international sanctions," he said.
</P>
<P>
"However, Iraqi pilgrims are not a target" of U.S. and
British warplanes patrolling the no-fly zones, Rubin added. "On
the contrary, the no-fly zones that we established were to
protect the Iraqi people from their own government's repression,
and so we will not take any action that would put innocent Iraqi
pilgrims in danger."
</P>
<P>
Iraq, with a population of more than 20 million, can send up
to 22,000 pilgrims to Mecca under a quota system which limits
the number of Muslims who can attend from each country. Nearly
2,000 Iraqis arrived in the kingdom by land on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Guinean Troops Engage S. Leonean Rebels in Heavy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The Guinean troops of the west
African peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG engaged the rebels in
Sierra Leone in heavy fighting on Monday and Tuesday in the border
town of Kambia, a report reaching here said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
An ECOMOG officer told reporters in Sierra Leonean capital
Freetown that the rebels Monday attacked Kambia on the border
between Guinea and Sierra Leone, and the heavy fighting continued
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted military sources as saying that thousands of
more troops were arriving from Guinea to shore up border defenses
following the attacks on Kambia launched by the Sierra Leonean
rebels.
</P>
<P>
Guinean forces at the weekend launched a major counter-attack,
including air strikes, against the rebels controlling much of
Sierra Leone's western border areas.
</P>
<P>
Aid workers said Guinean troops had pushed back the rebels,
who attacked the town of Pamalap in Guinea, back toward Kambia.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have suffered heavy casualties in the fighting
around Kambia with many bodies lying on the outskirts of the town,
aid workers were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian-led ECOMOG said Guinean troops are holding their
ground against the rebels in Kambia. However, travellers from the
area said the insurgents held large parts of the town.

<HEADLINE> Epidemic Claims 10 Victims in Netherlands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 16 (Xinhua) -- An epidemic, Legionnaires'
disease, at a Dutch flower show has killed 10 persons so far,
Dutch news media reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The bacterial infection was traced to a flower show in
Bovenkarpsel, 40 miles north of Amsterdam. Last month, some 80,000
people visited the weeklong Westfriese Flora show. Now the Dutch
government is trying to trace visitors of the show and determine
the exact source of the bacteria.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the bacteria stemmed from a fountain which
served as a centerpiece of exhibits. Usually, several national
flower shows are held throughout the western Netherlands each
Spring, when the 6 billion U.S.-dollar annual Dutch cut flower and
bulb industry shows off its wares.
</P>
<P>
The government confirmed on Monday that only five deaths were
due to Legionnaires' disease, although four others who had visited
the show since have died. Over 40 people were believed to have
been infected with the pneumonia-like illness.
</P>
<P>
Legionnaires' disease was first discovered after an outbreak at
a 1976 convention of the American Legion in Pennsylvania. The
bacteria that are believed to cause the illness are found in soil
and grow in air-conditioning ducts, storage tanks and rivers.
