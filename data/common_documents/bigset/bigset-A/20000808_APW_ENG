<HEADLINE> Comets 71, Mercury 54  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Tina Thompson, back at the scene of her MVP
performance in the WNBA All-Star Game, had 26 points and 10
rebounds as the Houston Comets beat the Phoenix Mercury 71-54
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams earned playoff berths earlier, but the loss consigned
the Mercury (19-12) to fourth place in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Game 1 of the Mercury's first-round series with Los Angeles
begins Friday in Phoenix, and the Comets (26-5) begin the first
round at Sacramento on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Sheryl Swoopes had 19 points and eight rebounds for the Comets.
Brandy Reed scored 21 points and Jennifer Gillom 11 for Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Three-time scoring champion Cynthia Cooper was held to just six
points -- only the second time in her career she didn't score in
double figures. Cooper also had six points in an 80-62 loss to
Phoenix on June 3.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets won their fourth straight road game to finish 13-3
away from the Compaq Center this season and took the series against
Phoenix, 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Reed had a career-high 32 points in that game, but in the next
one last month Swoopes held her to six on 2-for-11 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Swoopes had seven points during a 17-0 run by Houston midway
through the second half.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury, who never led, tied it at 41 on a free throw by
Dena Head 7:39 into the second half. But Thompson gave the Comets
the lead with a three-point play 17 seconds later, and in the next
seven minutes Swoopes made three jumpers and a field goal, Thompson
made her fifth 3-pointer in five tries and Cooper made a basket.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets moved to a 58-41 lead with 5:06 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who had an All-Star double-double in the America West
Arena three weeks ago, had seven points as the Comets took a 10-4
lead.
</P>
<P>
   But in the next 2:12, Gillom had a three-point play and made a
layup that tied it at 10. No more than five points separated the
teams until Swoopes threw a floor-length pass to Cooper for a layup
and a 39-33 Houston lead 3:54 into the second half.

<HEADLINE> Indians 2, Rangers 0  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Jim Thome, one of Cleveland's slowest runners,
scored on Travis Fryman's sacrifice fly in the seventh inning, and
Steve Woodard and four relievers combined on a five-hitter as the
Indians extended their winning streak to six with a 2-0 victory
over the Texas Rangers on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Thome reached around catcher Bill Haselman's tag to touch the
plate in the seventh and drove in Cleveland's other run with a
single in the eighth as the Indians matched their longest winning
streak this season.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland, which hadn't won six in a row since April 7-12, got
its first shutout since May 11 and moved within 2&AMP;frac12; games of
Oakland, which leads the AL wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   Gabe Kapler extended his hitting streak to 21 games for the
Rangers, who left the bases loaded in the fifth and sixth innings
and wasted a strong performance from starter Rick Helling (13-8).
</P>
<P>
   Helling allowed four hits in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Reed (2-0) picked up the win after Woodard, pitching on
two days' rest, worked 5 2-3 scoreless innings for the Indians, who
are 7-3 since making a flurry of trading deadline moves.
</P>
<P>
   Reed and three other relievers then combined for 3 1-3 hitless
innings, with Bob Wickman pitching the ninth for his third save.
</P>
<P>
   Helling retired 12 straight before his first and only walk -- to
Thome -- opened the seventh. One out later, a perfectly executed
hit-and-run single by Wil Cordero sent Thome to third.
</P>
<P>
   Fryman then hit a fly ball to medium right where outfielder Chad
Curtis was in perfect position to make a strong throw home. He
fired to the plate on the fly, but it was a little high, giving
Thome the chance to slap the plate as he slid by.
</P>
<P>
   TV replays appeared to show that Haselman actually tagged Thome
on the left shoulder, but plate umpire Brian Runge ruled Thome
safe.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth, Thome slapped an opposite-field RBI single to
left, scoring Omar Vizquel from second.
</P>
<P>
   Woodard was moved up in the rotation when scheduled starter Dave
Burba had to be pushed back until Wednesday because of a blister on
his right index finger.
</P>
<P>
   Woodard, acquired July 28 in a six-player deal with Milwaukee,
was sharp in his first outing for the Indians but lasted just three
innings his last start. Indians manager Charlie Manuel said before
the game that he didn't know what to expect.
</P>
<P>
   What Manuel and the Indians got was Woodard's best outing this
season.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, he snared a line drive by Rusty Greer to start an
inning-ending double play. Then in the fifth, after the Rangers put
two on with none out, left fielder Cordero made a leaping catch at
the wall to rob Ricky Ledee of extra bases.
</P>
<P>
   Woodard then struck out Haselman and walked Michael Lamb before
fanning Royce Clayton on a 3-2 pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers again loaded the bases in the sixth off Woodard. But
Tom Martin came in and got pinch-hitter Curtis to ground out to
keep the game scoreless.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Texas and Cleveland met for the first time since swapping
Ledee and David Segui on July 28. Ledee went 0-for-2 before being
lifted for a pinch-hitter in sixth. Segui went 0-for-4. ... Greer's
double in the sixth was his 1,000th career hit. He is the sixth
player in Texas history to reach the plateau. ... Ledee, now with
his third team -- Yankees, Indians and Rangers -- this season, is
also wearing his fourth number. He wore No. 17 in New York, Nos. 22
and 23 with Cleveland and has No. 12 with Texas. ... Helling has
thrown an AL-high 2,800 pitches this season, an average of 112 per
start.

<HEADLINE> Padres 6, Phillies 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Matt Clement pitched six strong innings as
the San Diego Padres beat the Philadelphia Phillies 6-4 Monday
night for their eighth win in nine games.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Rivera and Phil Nevin homered for the Padres, who have won
all four of their meetings with the Phillies this season.
</P>
<P>
   Clement (11-10) allowed two runs -- one earned -- on seven hits.
He walked two and struck out four.
</P>
<P>
   Clement started the seventh, but was pulled quickly after Tomas
Perez singled and Rob Ducey reached on an error. Carlos Almanzar
got two outs, gave up an RBI single to Scott Rolen and struck out
Mike Lieberthal to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Hoffman pitched the ninth for his 30th save in 36
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego took a 1-0 lead in the second on Rivera's homer, his
15th, off Robert Person (5-4). Eric Owens extended the lead with a
two-out RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Damian Jackson made it 4-0 with a two-out, two-run triple.
</P>
<P>
   Rolen hit his 20th of the season in the sixth to make it 4-1,
but Nevin hit a two-run shot -- his 23rd of the season -- in the
seventh off Mark Holzemer to give the Padres a five-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Abreu hit a two-run homer off Donne Wall in the ninth to
make it 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Clement worked out of jams in the second and third innings.
</P>
<P>
   With runners on second and third and one out, Clement got Perez
to pop out and struck out Person to end the second.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, Travis Lee was hit by a pitch and Pat Burrell
singled. Clement settled down and got Marlon Anderson to ground
into a double play before Perez ended the threat with a groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Person pitched 5 2-3 innings, allowed five hits and four runs.
He struck out eight, walked four and retired 10 in a row during one
stretch, but remain winless in his last eight starts.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Owens signed a two-year extension through the 2002 season.
Terms were not disclosed. ... Of Rivera's 68 hits this season, 31
have gone for extra bases. Last season, 40 of his 80 hits went for
extra bases. ... Anderson made his season debut for the Phillies at
second base. He went 1-for-3 and made two sensational diving stops
to rob Desi Relaford and Mike Darr of hits. ... Person's last win
came on May 27 at Los Angeles. ... Rolen has hit 20 or more homers
in four consecutive seasons. The last Phillies player to accomplish
the feat was Mike Schmidt, who hit 20-plus homers in nine straight
seasons from 1978-1987. ... Klesko stole his 18th base of the
season. His previous high was six set in 1996. ... Ducey,
re-acquired by the Phillies earlier in the day, pinch-hit and was
safe on an error in the seventh.

<HEADLINE> Erickson To Receive Elbow Surgery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Baltimore pitcher Scott Erickson will have a
ligament replaced in his right elbow, likely to sideline him for at
least a year.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson will be operated on Tuesday, with a tendon take from
his left wrist used to replace his ulnar collateral ligament,
Orioles trainer Richie Bancells said Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''Scotty has a long road ahead of him,'' Baltimore manager Mike
Hargrove said after the Orioles beat Detroit 4-3. ''I think we all
had a sneaking suspicion the outcome would be like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Erickson, 32, was 5-8 with a 7.87 ERA in his 11th major league
season. His last start was July 24.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Hargrove nor Bancells would speculate on how long it
will take Erickson to recover.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think next year's in doubt. It's safe to say the start of
the season's in doubt,'' Hargrove said.
</P>
<P>
   Bancells said 8-to-12 months is the usual recovery period.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a chance he could (come back) at the end of next
season,'' Bancells said. ''It has a high rate of success.''

<HEADLINE> Orioles Renew Red Wings Agreement  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- The Baltimore Orioles and Rochester Red
Wings on Monday signed a two-year renewal of the longest working
agreement in Triple-A baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Orioles owner Peter Angelos made his first trip to Rochester to
sign the agreement with Red Wings chief operating officer Naomi
Silver and president Gary Larder.
</P>
<P>
   Angelos has been the target of media and fan criticism in the
Flower City, where the Red Wings have not had a winning season
since winning the International League Governors' Cup playoffs in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Rochester was 53-62 entering last night's game against Norfolk.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had never realized the importance of a managing general
partner going to the affiliates to meet everyone,'' Angelos said.
''I was concerned about keeping Rochester as part of the Oriole
family, but I never made an overt effort.''
</P>
<P>
   He bought the Orioles in 1993, and said at that time, ''Our farm
system had been pretty much neglected for a period of about 10
years. For the last six years we have been trying to build it up,
by signing players and spending tremendous sums of money.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't believe you can build a winner just through free
agency,'' said the man who seemed to be trying to do just that
before the Orioles moved four starting players at the July 31
trading deadline. ''You need a farm system too.''
</P>
<P>
   The Baltimore-Rochester agreement, which began in 1961, will
complete its 40th season in September. The only longer connections
in minor league baseball are between Baltimore and rookie-ball
Bluefield, W.Va., begun in 1958, and the Detroit Tigers and Class-A
Lakeland, Fla., since 1960.

Monday night.

   Michelle VanGorp led Portland with 16 points. Tara Williams

<HEADLINE> Report: Miller, Pacers Near Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Indiana Pacers are close to re-signing
Reggie Miller for $36 million over three years, ESPN reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But Pacers spokesman David Benner said Monday night no deal has
been made.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until an announcement is made, there is no deal,'' Benner
said, adding that the Pacers do hope to re-sign the 13-year
veteran.
</P>
<P>
   A phone call to Miller's agent went unanswered Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers had four free agent starters entering the off-season
and Miller would be the second to come to terms. Jalen Rose, the
NBA's Most Improved Player last season, signed a seven-year deal
worth $93 million one week ago. The 6-foot-8 Rose, who moved into
the Pacers' starting lineup at small forward, averaged 18.2 points
in the regular season and 20.8 in the playoffs. He had a
career-high 40 points against Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who will be starting his 14th year in the NBA, earned
more than $9 million last season and averaged 18.1 points -- his
lowest mark since the 1988-89 season. Miller, who holds nearly
every franchise record, has scored 19,792 points and he holds NBA
records of 4,629 3-point attempts and 1,867 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Mark Jackson and center Rik Smits, who has said he is
considering retiring, are the other starters who are free agents.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers have already re-signed reserve forward Austin
Croshere to a seven-year deal worth more than $51 million, and
veteran backup center Sam Perkins to a one-year deal worth $2.5
million.

<HEADLINE> Mets 6, Astros 5, 11 Innings  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL A. LUTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Mike Hampton didn't come back to beat the Astros.
Derek Bell, however, did help send Houston to yet another loss.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, a throw-in in the Hampton trade, tied it with a two-out,
ninth-inning homer off former-Met Octavio Dotel, and New York went
on to beat the Astros 6-5 Monday night on Kurt Abbott's 11th-inning
homer.
</P>
<P>
   Dotel, who blew his second straight save chance after converting
his first five opportunities this season, was one of three players
sent to Houston in the Hampton trade Dec. 23.
</P>
<P>
   He relieved starting the ninth, protecting a 5-4 lead created by
Chris Truby's three-run double in a four-run fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton, 22-4 for the Astros last year, was dealt to the Mets
after he wouldn't agree to a contract extension and Houston decided
not to risk him becoming a free agent after this season.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Astros and Hampton (11-8) have struggled ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton, pitching for the first time at Enron Field, allowed
nine hits in seven innings. He also went 2-for-3 with two RBIs and
is hitting .315 (17-for-54) this season with eight RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Truby, however, is hot, with nine RBIs in his last two games. He
had six RBIs, including his first career grand slam, in Sunday's
8-1 win over Houston and had the big hit again.
</P>
<P>
   Houston had a chance to win in the ninth, putting a runner on
third against John Franco with two outs, but Daryle Ward grounded
out. The Astros put runners at first and second with one out in the
10th, but Armando Benitez (3-4) struck out Julio Lugo and Glen
Barker.
</P>
<P>
   Benitez got Moises Alou to fly out to Bell in right field to end
the game. Bell, who clashed with Astros manager Larry Dierker last
year, faked as if he was about to throw the ball into the stands.
Instead, Bell shook his head and kept it.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott, who hit a game-winning, 10th-inning homer against
Baltimore on June 8, homered off Jason Green (1-1) with one out in
the 11th, his fourth of the season.
</P>
<P>
   New York also had a chance in the 10th, but Todd Zeile was
thrown out at the plate by first baseman Jeff Bagwell, with plate
umpire Hunter Wendelstedt ruling catcher Tony Eusebio applied the
tag just before Zeile's hand touched the plate.
</P>
<P>
   In the first meeting of the season between the Mets and Astros,
Houston starter Wade Miller allowed four runs -- three earned -- six
hits and five walks in 5 1-3 innings, striking out five.
</P>
<P>
   With the Astros trailing 4-1 and one out in the fifth, Hampton
walked Lugo, and Lance Berkman and Bagwell followed with singles.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hidalgo flied out, Alou walked to load the bases and
Truby, recalled from Triple-A New Orleans on June 16 to replace
injured Ken Caminiti, doubled to the gap in right-center.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton's RBI single put the Mets ahead in the first following a
pair of walks by Miller, but Tony Eusebio tied it with an RBI
single in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Ventura hit a solo homer in the third, and Hampton had a
run-scoring infield hit in the fourth, with another run scoring
when Truby threw wildly to first after Hampton's dribbler down the
third-base line.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Mets have a 22-14 record in one-run games this season,
second-best in the NL behind Florida (25-15). Houston has the worst
record at 6-23. ... Mets relievers have saved 33 games in 39
chances. ... Alou played in his 1,000th major league game. ... The
Astros went over the 2 million attendance mark in their 52nd home
game Monday night. Last season, they didn't reach the 2 million
mark until Aug. 27 and it took 65 games. ... Mets 2B Edgardo
Alfonzo left in the ninth with a mild right groin strain after he
was hurt batting. He is day to day. Alfonzo was replaced in the
lineup by Abbott.

   DENVER (AP) -- Mike Myers forced home the go-ahead run with a
bases-loaded walk in the ninth inning, and the Pittsburgh Pirates
beat Colorado 8-7 Monday night, the Rockies' 24th loss in 32 games.
</P>
<P>
   With the score 7-all, Pat Meares reached against Jose Jimenez
(5-1) leading off the ninth on an error by shortstop Neifi Perez.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Young blooped a single to left and the runners advanced on
Adrian Brown's high bouncer to first. Jason Kendall was walked
intentionally to load the bases, and Myers walked Giles on a 3-1
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Sauerbeck (4-1) pitched 1 1-3 hitless innings, and Mike
Williams got three outs for his 16th save. Giles had three RBIs for
the Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Hammonds hit a two-run homer and Larry Walker added a
solo shot for Colorado, and Jeff Cirillo went 4-for-5.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh's Jimmy Anderson, who hasn't lost in six starts since
June 14 against Atlanta, allowed six runs -- four earned -- and nine
hits in six innings.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 5, Expos 2  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Curt Schilling pitched his second consecutive
complete game and improved to 3-0 since coming to Arizona as the
Diamondbacks, helped by a pair of strikeouts that weren't outs,
beat the Montreal Expos 5-2 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling (9-6) allowed eight hits in the first five innings,
but none the rest of the way to boost his record to 8-2 with a 1.72
earned run average in his last 11 starts. It was his sixth complete
game of the season, fifth in seven starts, and 63rd of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling has pitched eight consecutive complete games against
Montreal. He struck out five, walked one and retired the last 13
batters.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Finley struck out twice, but reached first safely both
times when Montreal catcher Chris Widger dropped the ball. The
miscues led to four unearned runs, two in the first and two in
Arizona's three-run sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Damian Miller doubled in a run in the sixth to break a 2-2 tie.
</P>
<P>
   Trey Moore (1-1) allowed only one earned run on eight hits. His
two strikeouts turned out to be two of Arizona's biggest offensive
plays.
</P>
<P>
   In the first inning, Jay Bell singled with one out, then Luis
Gonzalez was hit by a pitch. After Matt Williams fouled out, Finley
struck out for what would have been the third out.
</P>
<P>
   But Widger couldn't come up with the ball, which was far off the
plate. Widger then threw high to first for an error and Finley was
safe as Bell scored. Greg Colbrunn followed with an RBI single, and
Finley was thrown out at home on the play to end the inning with
Arizona up 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Finley led off the sixth and struck out again, but the fastball
glanced off Widger's mitt all the way to the backstop and he was
safe at first. Finley scored the go-ahead run on Miller's one-out
double to deep center field.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Bautista followed with an RBI single, and moved to second
on Schilling's sacrifice bunt. Tony Womack singled up the middle to
drive in Bautista to make it 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos tied it 2-2 on Peter Bergeron's bases-loaded single
with two outs in the fourth. Lee Stevens led off the inning with a
single. After two outs, Wilton Guerrero singled, then Moore lined
one off Schilling's leg to load the bases for Bergeron, who hit the
first pitch for a base hit up the middle.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Moore has allowed only one earned run in two starts (10 2-3
innings) since being recalled from Triple-A Ottawa. ... Womack made
a diving stop to his left to rob Jose Vidro of a hit in the first
inning. ... Right-hander Todd Stottlemyre, on the disabled list
with elbow tendinitis since June 26, will throw off the mound
Wednesday and tentatively is scheduled to return to Arizona's
rotation on Sept. 3.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Malaysia Leader Guilty of Sodomy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- A former Malaysian deputy prime
minister was convicted of sodomy Tuesday and sentenced to nine
years in prison, a widely expected verdict that ended Anwar
Ibrahim's two-year battle against what he has called a political
conspiracy against him.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar, 52, had predicted a guilty verdict as he was led into the
court, but veered between calm acceptance and outrage as High Court
Judge Ariffin Jaka read the verdict in a packed courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to be realistic,'' Anwar said to reporters while
hugging his wife, Azizah Ismail. ''Bloody, rotten judiciary!''
</P>
<P>
   Then he shouted, ''Sick!'' and threw up his hands up in
frustration before storming away from the public gallery to consult
with his lawyers, who said they would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's judgment ends a yearlong trial, the second for Anwar
since he was fired by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in 1998. It
has raised concerns about the fairness of Malaysia's judiciary, the
country's overall human rights record and Mahathir's determination
to continue his 19-year rule, the longest in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar and his allies have said the prosecution was stage-managed
to eliminate his challenge and crush his movement for more liberal
politics in the predominantly Muslim Southeast Asian nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is a coward who will not seek responsibility for his own
evil, so he used the court,'' Anwar said in the sentencing hearing.
''Dr. Mahathir's lust for power is insatiable. He will lie and
force others to lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Ariffin, who had maintained that he would render a verdict
based on the facts, not politics, read from a prepared statement
and systematically rejected Anwar's claims of conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Ariffin also found Anwar's codefendant and adopted brother,
Sukma Dermawan, guilty and described the testimony of their former
family driver and accuser, Azizan Abu Bakar, as unimpeachable.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm satisfied that the prosecution has proved its case beyond
reasonable doubt. I therefore find both the accused guilty as per
the charge,'' Ariffin said.
</P>
<P>
   During the case, Azizan twice changed the dates that he said he
had been sodomized and was painted by the defense as an opportunist
who lied for money.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 pro-Anwar supporters gathered outside the courthouse.
There was no violence, but they were confronted by hundreds of riot
police with water cannon on standby.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm shocked,'' defense attorney Christopher Fernando said
after the verdict. ''I'm absolutely flabbergasted. We will
definitely appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Malaysian law, sodomy is punishable by up to 20 years in
prison and a whipping by a rattan cane. Convicts older than 50
aren't beaten.
</P>
<P>
   The nine-year sentence will begin after Anwar finishes six years
for a corruption conviction handed down in 1999, removing him from
the Malaysian political scene that he once seemed destined to lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are despicable acts in our society,'' Ariffin said.
''This order of offense should meet with utmost condemnation.
People who commit such an offense should be dealt with properly.''
</P>
<P>
   Anwar's last words to the judge were: ''See you in 2014.''
</P>
<P>
   The corruption and sodomy allegations were leveled against Anwar
shortly after Mahathir abruptly fired him in September 1998,
triggering Anwar to call for reform of an entrenched political
system that he said was corrupt and beset with cronyism. The two
men had increasingly disagreed over how to handle the Asian
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The sacking brought some 30,000 people into the normally placid
streets of Kuala Lumpur to support Anwar in the biggest displays of
public protest in recent memory. Anwar was arrested and was beaten
in custody by the chief of the national police, fueling public
anger at the government.

<HEADLINE> Alleged Conspiracy at Paducah Plant  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PADUCAH, Ky. (AP) -- Former workers at an Energy Department plant
in Kentucky are seeking billions of dollars in damages for an
alleged conspiracy between the government and plant managers to
expose employees to radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys filed two lawsuits Monday on the behalf of workers at
the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant in western Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   The named defendants are former managers at the plant dating
back to 1952; companies that once operated it; federal agencies;
and Department of Energy Secretary Bill Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants exposed workers to ''radiation and substances
that were known to be harmful to humans,'' according to one suit,
filed in U.S. District Court in Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed on behalf of about 10,000 former plant
workers, said attorney William F. McMurry. It seeks $5 billion each
in compensatory and punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   The second suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Paducah, was
filed on behalf of specific workers who sustained rare pituitary
tumors ''as a result of excessive, unlawful and non-consensual
exposures to radioactive substances including plutonium and
neptunium.''
</P>
<P>
   It seeks $2 billion each in compensatory and punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits seek help from Richardson to locate the names of
former federal employees involved in the alleged conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's spokeswoman declined to specifically comment on the
suits.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have not yet been served with the lawsuits that were filed
today, but they in no way affect the department's commitment to
follow through on working to get compensation for sick nuclear
workers and continuing the investigations that will shed light on
what happened many years ago at Energy Department sites across the
county,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits were filed a day before the one-year anniversary of
a Washington Post article that the plant had unknowingly been
handling highly radioactive metals for several years. That puts the
lawsuits within the one-year statute of limitations when workers
first learned about the alleged exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier lawsuits have sought money from the companies to clean
up radioactive waste from the plant. The new suits speak to the
alleged conspiracy by the government and others.

<HEADLINE> Plaza Hotel security guards shoot burglary suspect  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Security guards at the Central Park south
landmark Plaza Hotel chased a burglary suspect through the lobby
and shot him outside.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, who was not identified, was approached in the lobby
about 9 p.m. Monday by guards who recognized him from surveillance
videotapes taken during a previous theft, police said.
</P>
<P>
   As the suspect left the hotel, he pulled a gun and fired shots
at the guards, prompting one of them to fire one shot back, hitting
him in the arm, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses described a wild scene as the fleeing suspect, wearing
a blue suit and tie, skirted around the William Tecumseh Sherman
statue in front of the hotel and hopped into a taxi at 60th Street
and Fifth Avenue, about a block away.
</P>
<P>
   Police cars hemmed the taxi in. The suspect jumped out of the
cab and was wrestled to the ground by police officers, witnesses
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth Avenue was closed between 60th and 62nd streets for about
two hours while police interviewed witnesses and combed the area
for shell casings.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect was taken to St. Clair's Hospital, where he was
listed in stable condition.
</P>
<P>
   No other injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone calls to the Plaza Hotel were unanswered.

<HEADLINE> Wildfires Push Montanans From Homes  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON DININNY
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMILTON, Mont. (AP) -- Authorities warned Montana residents
Monday to follow evacuation orders as fires continued to ravage
western states and creep closer toward ancient artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   Ravalli County Sheriff Perry Johnson expected further
evacuations as a result of Montana's 19 major fires that burned
about 167,800 acres and destroyed 73 buildings, officials said.
Johnson told people to move livestock and prepare to get out.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you choose wrongly ... you may stay there forever,''
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The wildfire at Mesa Verde National Park in southwestern
Colorado moved past cliff dwellings and headed toward a research
center, where firefighters stood guard Monday to protect priceless
artifacts that were used by ancestral Pueblo Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Fire team spokesman Don Ferguson said the 5,000-acre blaze was
less than 5 percent contained by evening and remained a
''persistent threat'' to archaeological sites, Ferguson said.
</P>
<P>
   Fires triggered evacuations south of Helena, and another that
burned perilously close to Interstate 15 south of the city, closing
part of the route.
</P>
<P>
   The National Interagency Fire Center in Idaho said 65 major
fires were burning more than 826,800 acres, an area larger than the
state of Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   Forest Service Chief Mike Dombeck said some Montana and Idaho
fires could burn for months. More than 20,000 civilian and military
firefighters managed to contain 60 fires in the past week, Dombeck
said, but new fires were igniting just as fast.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's highly likely we'll be looking to the military
for more help,'' Dombeck said in Idaho. ''Our fire season could be
another two months, maybe a little longer.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton plans to visit an Idaho wildfire on Tuesday
for a firsthand assessment of what has been called the worst fire
season in 50 years. Officials said Clinton wants to thank
firefighters and soldiers for their work protecting homes and
valuable natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   Fires burned on both sides of Montana's scenic Bitterroot Valley
on Monday. Some residents have fled under orders for mandatory
evacuation, and others have chosen to leave on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Not Al and Nola Grisso of Pinesdale, just north of Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wouldn't leave unless we absolutely had to,'' Grisso said
Monday at his log home, with an American flag in front and smoke
visible from the porch. Told last week that they might have to
flee, the Grissos had packed their most valued belongings.
</P>
<P>
   But at the homes of many of their neighbors, knocks on the doors
went unanswered Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The area of southwestern Montana grew considerably in the 1990s,
swelling with urban expatriates eager for a Montana retreat -- a log
home, nestled in the forest, with snow-capped mountains on the
horizon. Now, many of those mountains are charred, and the trees
next to the homes are potential torches.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Frye, chief ranger at Glacier National Park, said the
threat of fire is one of the perils people take on when they move
to such places.
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of message that bounced off of Clint Belyea, a
valley resident now anxiously awaiting word on his home at a fire
camp. Over the weekend, he and his wife fled with about a third of
their belongings.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really don't want to hear that this is nature doing its
thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fires were burning in 10 other western states Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists scrambled to keep up with firefighters building a
containment line around the Mesa Verde fire, trying to find and
mark artifacts scattered around the park. Mesa Verde had a
23,000-acre fire last month.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa Verde firefighters caught got a little break Monday
afternoon when a rain storm swept over the mesa.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wasn't enough to put it out, but it was enough to keep it
from spreading,'' said Ferguson.
</P>
<P>
   Ten major fires were burning on 175,000 acres in Idaho,
including the nation's largest fire, which had blackened more than
102,000 acres. Idaho fires have burned more than 350,000 acres
since early last month.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters were nearing containment in major blazes in
California and Utah.

<HEADLINE> States To Hold Primaries  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT TANNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sons of three prominent elected officials in Missouri
seeking to follow their parents into office headed into primaries
Tuesday for two seats in Congress and secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   An open governor's seat in Missouri also drew several
candidates, while races began in earnest for Senate seats in
Michigan and Missouri. Other primary elections were held in
Colorado and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The retirement of 32-year Democratic Rep. William L. Clay -- the
first black congressman from Missouri -- set off a scramble. Among
six Democratic would-be successors is one very recognizable name:
William L. Clay Jr. The winning Democratic candidate faces
Republican, Reform and Libertarian opponents in the state's most
heavily Democratic district.
</P>
<P>
   Also retiring this year is four-term Democratic Rep. Pat Danner,
whose son, former state Sen. Steve Danner, heads a list of four
Democrats trying to succeed her. Five Republicans were also in the
running. And in the race for secretary of state, Republican Matt
Blunt faced two Republicans for the GOP nomination for the seat his
father, Rep. Roy Blunt, held from 1985 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Clay, who has said in the past that he was running on his record
of nine years in the state Senate, acknowledged Monday that his
father's name gives him an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a Clay, I know that I inherit his friends as well as his
enemies,'' the younger Clay said. ''Seeing as how he's been elected
16 times, I think he's got more friends than enemies in this
congressional district.''
</P>
<P>
   With term limits forcing Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan out, the
two-term Democrat is challenging freshman Republican Sen. John
Ashcroft. Both faced token opposition in their primaries.
</P>
<P>
   In the race for Missouri governor, four-term Rep. Jim Talent
faced two little-known challengers for the GOP nomination.
Treasurer Bob Holden was unopposed for the Democratic nomination,
and TV minister Larry Rice was running as an independent.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, neither freshman GOP Sen. Spence Abraham nor his
Democratic challenger, Rep. Debbie Stabenow, faced any primary
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, four Republicans are seeking the GOP nomination to
challenge first-term Democratic Rep. Mark Udall.
</P>
<P>
   In Boulder County, three Democrats sought the nomination to
replace District Attorney Alex Hunter, who has been in the job for
27 years but has been criticized for his handling of the JonBenet
Ramsey case. A Republican candidate was unopposed.
</P>
<P>
   And in Georgia, Democrats Roger Kahn and Jim Williams went to
Tuesday's runoff for the nomination to challenge Republican Rep.
Bob Barr in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Also in Missouri, a husband and wife are seeking nominations to
oppose each other for an open state House seat. Jerry Riley is
seeking the Republican nomination while his wife, Jennifer Graham,
is running as a Democrat. Each faced primary opposition.

<HEADLINE> 11th World Conference on Tobacco  </HEADLINE>
By MARTHA IRVINE
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Thousands of health and other professionals have
gathered this week to tackle a long-standing question: What's the
best way to get people to quit smoking?
</P>
<P>
   It is a daunting task for officials meeting in Chicago for the
11th World Conference on Tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide estimates of smoking-related deaths are no more
heartening.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the conference say smoking will contribute to the
deaths of 4 million people this year. If unchecked, they say those
deaths will increase to 10 million in 2030.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gro Harlem Brundtland told a room full of the conference's
4,500 attendees that such figures should motivate ''a truly global
debate'' on the tobacco issue.
</P>
<P>
   Brundtland, director-general of the World Health Organization,
also called for a unified anti-smoking approach: high cigarette
taxes bolstered by hard-hitting anti-smoking ads, a ban on smoking
in public places and increased access to programs that help smokers
quit.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know what works,'' she said. By doing what works, ''we save
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, some countries are taking action. In Norway, a pack of
cigarettes costs more than $7, mostly due to taxes. In Canada,
federal law requires cigarette packs to carry graphic images,
including photos of a smoker's deteriorated lungs, heart or gums.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Brundtland said, the WHO also plans to start work on
a treaty for its 190 member countries. The treaty will seek to
prevent the sale of cheaper, smuggled cigarettes and share
anti-smoking campaigns and education materials with developing
countries, which account for about 70 percent of smoking-related
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   An American Cancer Society study prepared for the conference
found that, of 196 countries monitored, about half prohibit the
sale of cigarettes to minors and only about a third have access to
pharmaceutical treatments for nicotine dependence.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, about a third of those countries have health warnings
on their cigarette packs, with Canada's among the most graphic.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel the cigarette pack is the No. 1 tool to reaching
smokers and their families,'' said Norman Brown, director of
regulations and compliance for that country's Tobacco Control
Programme.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said Canadian health officials decided to use the
''larger, full-color and graphic'' images because written warnings
on cigarette packs are beginning to lose their effect. He also said
that, while the number of smoking Canadians has dropped in the last
five years, the number of young people who've start smoking has
increased slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone at the conference believes high cigarette taxes and
anti-smoking campaigns will be enough to get people to stop
smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Lars Ramstrom, director of the Institute for Tobacco Studies in
Sweden, said chewing tobacco may help hard-core smokers quit.
</P>
<P>
   Ramstrom said a study found that ''snus'' -- a moist, unfermented
chewing tobacco popular in the Scandinavian country -- helped
smokers quit. He said early studies indicate that smoking tobacco
is much more harmful to one's health than chewing it.
</P>
<P>
   Some health professionals, especially those who treat tobacco
chewers for cancers of the mouth, were troubled by Ramstrom's
suggestion. But he said it was unrealistic to think everyone can
quit ''cold turkey.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The real world shows us that's not the only way to go,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Strike enters third day as talks continue  </HEADLINE>
By GREG TOPPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Striking telephone workers in 12 states and
the District of Columbia went into their third day without a
contract Tuesday after talks between Verizon Communications and two
unions snagged over job-security issues.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators wrapped up Monday's formal talks around 8 p.m. Both
sides said they were committed to returning to the bargaining table
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The strike by 87,200 company employees affects operations for 25
million customers from Maine to Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday afternoon, the Communications Workers of America,
the larger of the two unions in negotiations, said several
job-security issues had slowed the overall progress of contract
talks. Chief among the barriers was the question of transfer of
work to other areas served by Verizon's coast-to-coast service
area.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a big issue, to protect the people that we have now,
and for growth of membership,'' said Jack Marshall, an IBEW
official from Worcester, Mass. ''We want jobs for our kids,
basically.''
</P>
<P>
   The company, formed in June by the merger of Bell Atlantic and
GTE Corp., says it needs flexibility to distribute calls depending
on the level of traffic. But unions fear Verizon could move work to
areas that are cheaper or have less of a union presence, or could
force employees to relocate.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue bogging down talks deals with a subsidiary of
Verizon that handles wiring within homes, CWA officials said. That
division split off from the main business several years ago so that
it could have a separate wage scale and compete more effectively
with rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The unions argue that some of the work done by this subsidiary
in five states and the District of Columbia should be handled by
union workers.
</P>
<P>
   Other issues still unresolved include organizing rights for
wireless workers, forced overtime and workplace stress.
</P>
<P>
   Another sensitive issue at the bargaining table is the unions'
ability to organize in Verizon's burgeoning wireless division,
where fewer than 50 of the 32,000 workers are union members.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders say they want to ensure that their members have
access to jobs in the wireless division, and are pushing for a
system in which employees could vote for representation by filling
out an authorization card, a process labor leaders call less
cumbersome than secret balloting.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon says ballot elections would protect workers' rights
better.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Verizon officials bristled at the idea that union
members don't already have access to high-tech jobs. Spokesman Eric
Rabe said the company has experienced tremendous growth in its
unionized data business, which provides high-speed Internet
service.
</P>
<P>
   ''The objective is for us to add high-tech new economy jobs
there,'' said Rabe, the company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The strike affects the District and 12 states: Delaware, Maine,
Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York,
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   According to the company, 14,000 employees picketed in front of
Verizon facilities Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Those included about 350 in Providence, R.I., many of whom
carried signs reading ''Stop Corporate Greed'' and ''Jobs with
Justice.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There doesn't seem to be any loyalty to workers,'' said John
Lang, 52, of Johnston, R.I., a technician for 32 years. ''All we
want is a few crumbs from the table and don't give our jobs away.''
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, 200 strikers shouted ''Scab!'' as workers who crossed
the lines entered and exited Verizon's offices. Some had police
escorts.
</P>
<P>
   Workers in several cities wore black T-shirts with a cobra
rising from the union symbol and the slogan ''Will strike if
provoked.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, police on Monday reported 56 incidents of
violence or harassment and 40 acts of vandalism against phone
company installations since Sunday, when the strike began.
</P>
<P>
   In the workers' absence, about 30,000 Verizon managers filled
in, pledging to work seven-day weeks of 12-hour shifts.

<HEADLINE> Children Still Missing in Guatemala  </HEADLINE>
By RICARDO MIRANDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- When the army raided his village, Baudilio
Monzon ran one way, his parents ran the other. That day, Feb. 18,
1984, was the last they saw of the 9-year-old Mayan boy.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, came a sign he was still alive. A military
helicopter dropped propaganda fliers with a photo of the boy in a
hospital bed and a promise of safety for villagers who surrender to
the army.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank God, I am being healed,'' the flier had the boy saying.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Baudilo's parents have heard nothing of his fate.
</P>
<P>
   Monzon's case is one of 86 documented in a report being released
to the public Tuesday by the Roman Catholic Church's main human
rights office in Guatemala on children who vanished during the
country's 36-year civil war, which ended in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The report's authors said there are accounts of 358 other cases
that could not be fully documented.
</P>
<P>
   Of the vanished children, 86 percent were abducted, said Nery
Rodenas, director of the Archbishop's Human Rights Office. Most of
the disappearances were caused by the military, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we have in our hands is the confirmation that children
were used as war booty, that forced disappearance was used as an
instrument of war against those most vulnerable, the children, and
in cases such as that of Baudilio, they were used for military
ends,'' Rodenas told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The report attributed 92 percent of the disappearances to the
military, 3 percent to government-organized paramilitary groups and
2 percent of guerrillas. The causes of 3 percent could not be
clarified.
</P>
<P>
   The office of the military spokesman, Capt. Jose Maria
Valladares, said it had not seen the report and would not comment
until it had.
</P>
<P>
   The Archbishop's Human Rights Office says they are still looking
for the children, so no one knows for sure whether they are dead or
alive.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the victims were members of Guatemala's Maya Indian
majority, who suffered most from the army's scorched-earth campaign
against leftist rebels. Hundreds of villages were raided and many
were obliterated.
</P>
<P>
   Baudilio's father -- not named in the report -- said he had heard
soon after his son's disappearance that the boy was being kept at a
military unit in Xalbal, about 180 miles north of the capital.
Years later he heard Baudilio was in the care of a colonel named
Castillo.
</P>
<P>
   ''They told us he had been wounded by a bullet... and after that
he had gone to the capital. But we know nothing about him,'' the
father said in testimony published in the report.
</P>
<P>
   Rodenas said many of the families lack the resources to search
for the children. ''Furthermore, there is still fear of reprisals,
which leads them to leave things as they are,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the next step is to try to locate the missing children
and try to reunite them with their families.
</P>
<P>
   The coordinator of the human rights office, Bishop Mario Rios
Montt, urged Guatemalans to confront the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let it not be a political issue nor a motive for profit or
sensationalism,'' he said. ''Remember that it involves human beings
who have been profoundly harmed by war.''

<HEADLINE> Geneseo professor Charles R. Bailey dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - State University College at Geneseo
history professor, Charles R. ''Randy'' Bailey, has died of cancer
at 62.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey, a member of the SUNY Geneseo faculty since 1967, was
serving as chairman of the history department at the time of his
death last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   SUNY named Bailey a distinguished service professor in 1997, a
title that promoted him above full professor.
</P>
<P>
   ''Randy Bailey served the college in uniquely valuable ways for
33 years,'' SUNY Geneseo President Christopher C. Dahl said. ''He
was remarkable for his contributions to his departments and to
statewide organizations, and for his enthusiastic support of
cultural and intellectual life on campus.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Unionville Center, Ohio, Bailey earned his bachelor's
degree from Ohio University in Athens in 1960. He received a
master's degree and doctorate from the University of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   He was a specialist in early modern history and the history of
education. He published two books and many articles, which gained
him a reputation as an important scholar in the field of the French
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Susan Ferrall Bailey of Geneseo; two
daughters, Kate Bailey of Santa Monica, Calif., and Rachel Bailey
of Rochester; his mother, Alberta Bailey of Unionville Center; and
two brothers, Larry Bailey of Danville, Va., and Joseph Bailey of
Perrysburg, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial service will be 2 p.m. Tuesday in the Alice Austin
Theatre in the William A. Brodie Fine Arts Building on the SUNY
Geneseo campus.
</P>
<P>
   Burial will be in Lancaster, Ohio.

<HEADLINE> Missile Defense Review Is Delayed  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon will take longer than expected to
prepare a recommendation to President Clinton on whether to move
forward with a national missile defense system, Defense Secretary
William Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen issued a brief written statement Monday that said he would
need a few more weeks to consider the complex question, which
carries major implications for the defense budget and for U.S.
international relations.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary recently said he expected to make his
recommendation to Clinton by mid-August. Instead he is likely to
wait until early September, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   That still would give Clinton time to decide before leaving
office whether to authorize initial steps toward building a new
missile-tracking radar in Alaska -- a critical first step toward
eventual deployment of a national missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   ''A number of difficult issues remain to be resolved,'' Cohen
said.
</P>
<P>
   These issues, including whether the rocket booster to be used
for the anti-missile system can be ready for full-scale production
by 2003, must be settled before Cohen receives the Pentagon's
internal assessment, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another unsettled question is whether the Pentagon should
proceed with the next flight test of the anti-missile system as
scheduled this fall. Officials are considering putting it off until
December or later. The failure of the two most recent flight tests,
including one in early July, raised questions about whether the
Pentagon was pushing too hard to meet a target date for deploying
the system by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Pushing back the target date to 2006 or later probably would
increase the project's overall cost, another factor being weighed
by the Pentagon. Current cost estimates are about $60 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The internal review now under way is headed by Jacques Gansler,
the undersecretary of defense for acquisition and technology, and
officials of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, which runs
the project.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will make no recommendation about the future of the NMD
program until I have analyzed their findings,'' Cohen said. ''I
expect that to happen and to report to the president within the
next few weeks. Recent reports that I have made a decision on this
matter, preliminary or otherwise, are wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no immediate or artificial deadline for a
recommendation to the president,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ''My goal is to make the best possible recommendation, ... not
the earliest possible recommendation.''

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Army Deals With Desertion  </HEADLINE>
By NAMINI WIJEDASA
<TEXT>
<P>
   PIMBURA, Sri Lanka (AP) -- Fighting Tamil Tiger rebels trying to
divide this small tropical island isn't the Sri Lankan army's only
problem. The 100,000-strong military is struggling to stop its
soldiers from deserting the ranks.
</P>
<P>
   It's gotten to the point that police have been ordered to search
homes in the capital for deserters working as domestic help.
Security agencies have been told that their licenses will be
suspended if they employ deserters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Desertions take place every day,'' said Harry Goonetilleke,
retired air marshal and military analyst. ''The statistics three
months ago was 22,000 deserters.''
</P>
<P>
   Desertions from the volunteer army -- fueled by a series of
defeats on the battlefield -- have become one of the main
impediments in winning the war that has killed more than 62,000
people since 1983 in this country the size of West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   For Cpl. Upendra, it has been a battle of wits evading the
police and trying to survive since he deserted two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Upendra, who refused to give his last name, said he became
disillusioned with the army in 1998. He refused to return to camp
after going home on leave and has been working odd jobs since.
</P>
<P>
   Deserters can be jailed for three years, army spokesman Maj.
Anura Gunesekera said. But the army usually reinducts captured or
surrendered deserters immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers flee the battlefront for several reasons: disagreement
with their officers; fear of dying or getting maimed; inadequate
leave to visit their families; lure of a quiet life in a village.
</P>
<P>
   To this list Goonetilleke added low morale caused by a series of
battlefield reversals.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam overran one
military camp after another and seized control of the main highway
in the northern peninsula, reaching to outskirts of their former
capital, Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
   They were lobbing mortar shells on the airport and seaport
before the government bought new planes and other weapons and
halted the rebel advance in May.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not easy to motivate the army in the face of such huge
defeats,'' said Goonetilleke. ''Battlefield reversals are the
biggest setback to morale.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Goonetilleke nor others interviewed felt that desertions
indicated indifference to the issues of the war, in which the
Tigers are fighting to create a separate homeland for the Tamil
minority.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor fueling desertion is the army's reluctance to
grant home leave. ''We get no leave for months on end,'' said Cpl.
Anura Perera, who served in the north, where most of the war is
being fought.
</P>
<P>
   Elle Gunawansa, chief priest of the Buddhist Dharmayathanaya
temple in Colombo, hosted a radio talk show last month urging
deserters to call and tell their problems.
</P>
<P>
   His desk is now piled high with letters. Most of them complain
of lack of vacation or personal problems. The soldiers mostly want
to spend time with their families or care for their ailing parents.
</P>
<P>
   ''We treat soldiers as fighting machines but they are human
beings who have problems which have to be tackled,'' said
Gunawansa.
</P>
<P>
   The government tries to persuade deserters like Upendra to
rejoin through amnesties. Three thousand soldiers have rejoined
during four amnesties this year and another was declared Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Unhappy with the response, however, the military and police
arrested more than 5,000 deserters during the past two months in a
countrywide sweep aimed at inspiring more discipline in the
military.
</P>
<P>
   But Upendra says he won't go back during any amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   Upendra, 31, lives in a sparsely furnished house in Pimbura, a
village 40 miles east of Colombo, the capital. He has a ready
smile, brightened by the juice of the red betel leaves he chews,
and he speaks proudly of his army service.
</P>
<P>
   ''I battled in operational areas of the north and east ever
since I joined the army in 1990,'' Upendra recounted, hugging his
5-year-old son to his chest.
</P>
<P>
   One day as rebels attacked his platoon, Upendra told a colleague
that their commander, a young lieutenant, knew of an impending
attack, yet didn't alert the army headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had no ground experience like us. Only book knowledge,''
Upendra said. ''Unfortunately, he heard me criticizing him from his
position behind a tree where he had been crouching.''
</P>
<P>
   Upendra's platoon repelled the rebels. But he says the officer
held a grudge against him and treated him unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I decided then that when I next went home I would not go
back,'' he said. ''I was a loyal man who lost faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Upendra makes a little money from odd jobs but has no hope of
finding employment. Companies require a letter from the village
chief certifying a man has been discharged from the army before he
can be hired.
</P>
<P>
   Some deserters take to crime. Up to 15 percent of crimes are in
some way linked to deserters, said Inspector-General of Police
Lucky Kodituwakku.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister Anuruddha Ratwatte said the military spends
around $5,000 on each soldier for training. ''It hurts when he
deserts,'' he said. ''So we want them back.''

<HEADLINE> Lawyer jailed for violating probation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - A judge in Monroe County ordered a
disbarred Rochester lawyer to prison after for failing to repay
money stolen from a client.
</P>
<P>
   William S. Wood was sentenced to serve one to three years behind
bars by Monroe County Court Judge Charles T. Maloy for violating
probation on his conviction for fourth-degree grand larceny.
</P>
<P>
   When Wood pleaded guilty two years ago, Maloy sentenced him to
five years' probation and ordered him to pay $46,000 in
restitution. But the judge found him in violation of his probation
last month because Wood repaid only $550 and didn't complete an
alcohol-rehabilitation program.
</P>
<P>
   Although Assistant District Attorney Jennifer Whitman asked that
Wood be sent to prison, Wood asked for another chance to fulfill
his obligations.
</P>
<P>
   But Maloy said Wood deserved prison time for shirking his
responsibilities and discrediting the legal profession.
</P>
<P>
   Wood, 44, stole the money from clients who were attempting to
foreclose on a property on which they held the mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   He collected the money from the property owner and deposited it
in his trust account but didn't turn over the money to his clients.
</P>
<P>
   The Appellate Division of state Supreme Court disbarred Wood in
November 1998, two months after he pleaded guilty and surrendered
his license to practice law.

   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Al Gore is launching an historic
Democratic ticket with Sen. Joseph Lieberman and his ''real sense
of awe,'' hoping to surge into his nominating convention with a
burst of energy and the moral high ground.
</P>
<P>
   The new allies huddled privately, setting the stage for a
colorful campaign rally to unveil the ticket. They were quickly
headed for a nostalgic swing through Gore's home town and
Lieberman's home state.
</P>
<P>
   With his decision, Gore drew some of the clearest distinctions
with President Clinton by picking one of the president's sharpest
Democratic critics, and his strategists made it clear the pick was
based heavily on Lieberman's respected moral and religious
standing.
</P>
<P>
   It was an effort to buttress Gore against Republican efforts to
tarnish Gore with the sex scandals that have swirled around
Clinton, a central theme of last week's Republican convention.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman also brings the first Jewish running mate to a major
party ticket in history.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you look at the two, you can see a natural bonding that
occurred,' said Gore spokesman Chris Lehane. ''They are both very,
very strong family men. They are two people who feel faith should
play an important part of their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans quickly sought to find differences they can exploit
between Gore and Lieberman, differences on issues like Social
Security and school vouchers that both Democrats dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Gore said he wanted to wait for his formal
announcement before talking about the fine points. ''You'll have a
chance to discuss specific details in some detail.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman found more similarities than differences.
</P>
<P>
   ''Al Gore and I have pretty much walked the same path and when
we've had disagreements they've been good-faith disagreements,
never disagreements that touch our values,'' said Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   With his selection, Gore picked a moderate Democrat from a
reliably Democratic state. Most polls have shown Republican rival
George W. Bush building a lead in the wake of the Republican
National Convention, and Gore is hoping to seize attention and
galvanize support heading into next week's Democratic convention.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have also sought to tie Gore to Clinton,
particularly Clinton's relationship with a White House intern.
Lieberman was one of the earliest and sharpest Democratic critics
of Clinton's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   He's also been a sharp critic of Clinton-Gore fund-raising
tactics and has teamed up with conservative Republicans to
criticize sex and violence in the entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were split on whether Gore's tactic would work, as Gore
walks a tightrope facing every vice president running on his own --
breaking with the boss.
</P>
<P>
   California-based Democratic consultant Bill Carrick said
Republicans are certain to remind voters of Clinton's actions and
Lieberman can at least distance Gore from the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton was unhappy with the choice, there was no public
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's wonderful,'' said Clinton. ''He's been a
wonderful friend to me.''
</P>
<P>
   By picking a Jewish running mate, Gore raised the potential that
religion could be an issue for the first time since the nation
elected its first Catholic president in John Kennedy in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm confident I won't be judged on my faith,'' said Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   But Lieberman's devout faith will play at least some role in the
campaign, because it generally prohibits him from campaigning on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously we're going to be very, very respectful of their
religion,'' said Lehane. ''Having a day off is probably a good
thing for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Faith is part of me,'' said Lieberman. ''It's been at the
center of who I've been all my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman planned a tour of Midwestern battleground
states before heading to the convention in Los Angeles next week
for a ceremonial passing of the torch from Clinton, who is
scheduled to speak Monday and leave town before the new team
arrives. Gore hoped to capture campaign attention and magnify a
poll ''bounce'' from his convention.
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding the hubbub surrounding the selection, some noted
that the election is not likely to turn on the running mate in
either party.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the end, people are going to vote for a president, not a
vice president,'' said Bob Lichter of the Center for Media and
Public Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In making his decision, Gore picked Lieberman over a relatively
short list of finalists. They included Massachusetts Sen. John
Kerry, North Carolina Sen. John Edwards and Indiana Sen. Evan Bayh.
</P>
<P>
   Gore huddled privately with top aides into the wee hours Monday
before making his pick, phoning Lieberman at 11:58 a.m. and closing
the deal in the 12-minute call.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign dispatched a private jet to whisk Lieberman and
some family members to Nashville for a quiet dinner and the formal
announcement at a downtown plaza.

<HEADLINE> Leiberman Shares Bush Positions  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrat Al Gore has picked as his running
mate a longtime advocate of school vouchers -- an idea Gore says
would undermine public education.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Sen. Joseph Lieberman are a close centrist fit on a
variety of issues. But Lieberman's support for vouchers, his
earlier statements on Social Security privatization and his backing
of a national missile defense program raise questions about how
Gore can continue to plausibly attack Republican candidate George
W. Bush on those very matters.
</P>
<P>
   The National Education Association, the largest teachers union,
said Lieberman's favored education reforms have no bearing on its
endorsement of Gore for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to look at who's heading up the ticket,'' said
Kathleen Lyons, speaking for the union. ''There's no confusion
about how Vice President Gore feels about this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Feldman, president of the American Federation of
Teachers, voiced similar sentiments. But some teachers were sharply
critical of Gore's selection.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm stunned he would make such a bad choice considering how
much he's going to need to count on teachers for support,'' said
Gary Krane, a Los Angeles substitute teacher and NEA member.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, from Connecticut, was an early proponent of
experimental voucher programs that would let parents use federal
money to send children to a public, private or religious school of
their choice.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s he introduced an ill-fated plan to try vouchers
for thousands of children in up to 20 communities nationwide.
Although his most recent education initiatives have not included
vouchers, his spokesman Dan Gerstein said ''he hasn't changed his
mind'' and still supports them.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gerstein said Lieberman is ''going to work with Al Gore
on the Al Gore agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has frequently attacked Bush for proposing vouchers for
children in chronically failing schools. As well, Gore repeatedly
went after Democratic primary opponent Bill Bradley for supporting
the same pilot projects Lieberman wanted to try.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will never, ever support private school vouchers,'' Gore
told the 2.5-million member NEA last month.
</P>
<P>
   He told the 1-million member teachers federation, ''It's as
clear as A-B-C. You cannot save the public schools of America by
destroying public schools in America.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I find it a real strike against Gore,'' said Bill Taxerman, a
25-year veteran teacher in Los Angeles and federation member. ''He
stood up and swore to us he would never support vouchers and
chooses a vice presidential running mate who's for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, a founder of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council,
and Lieberman, its chairman for the last five years, are close in
their positions in favor of liberalized trade, strong environmental
protection, abortion rights and more.
</P>
<P>
   But Lieberman has repeatedly sided with Republicans on a
national missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1998, he spoke favorably of exploring the partial
privatization of Social Security, telling The San Diego
Union-Tribune: ''A remarkable wave of innovative thinking is
advancing the concept of privatization. ... I think in the end that
individual control of part of the retirement-Social Security funds
has to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has proposed partial privatization; Gore calls that risky.
</P>
<P>
   Gerstein said Lieberman has since taken a position against
Social Security privatization.
</P>
<P>
   ''Regardless of what he said then, he took a much harder look
and ultimately decided it was the wrong thing to do.'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Rotherham, an education specialist with Democratic
Leadership Council, said the differing positions on school vouchers
are ''much ado about nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The record shows he's never looked at this as some sort of
large-scale solution,'' Rotherham said of Lieberman. ''Vice
President Gore and Senator Lieberman share the same beliefs on the
key issues -- accountability, investment and partnership.''
</P>
<P>
   But similarities between Democrat Lieberman and Republican Bush
on education do not stop with vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has continued to promote the expansion of tax-free
education savings accounts to help parents of children in public,
private and religious schools alike pay for education expenses.
Advanced by congressional Republicans, the idea is another prime
feature of Bush's education agenda.
</P>
<P>
   It's Lieberman's voucher position, however, that most caught the
eye of Leonard DeFiore, president of the National Catholic
Educational Association, representing teachers in 10,000 Catholic
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think he's on the side of the angels,'' DeFiore said.
''This is clearly a big step. How big a step, remains to be seen.''

11th World Conference on Tobacco. Worldwide estimates of smoking-related deaths
are no more heartening. Officials at the conference say smoking will contribute
to the deaths of 4 million people this year. If unchecked, they say those deaths

verdict as he was led into the court, but veered between calm acceptance and
outrage as High Court Judge Ariffin Jaka read the verdict in a packed courtroom.
Tuesday's judgment ends a yearlong trial, the second for Anwar since he was

<HEADLINE> Lynne Cheney Talks To the AP  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Lynne Cheney knew her family life would not be
the same when a truck toting a satellite dish and a camera
suspended from a pole parked in front of her home in a Dallas
suburb soon before George W. Bush chose her husband as his running
mate.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney called it ''one of my endearing memories'' in an
Associated Press interview as she sat on a vintage train rumbling
through the countryside. With her on the train were more than 100
journalists, a slew of Secret Service agents, dozens of
20-something campaign workers and a mobile satellite dish for film
crews.
</P>
<P>
   It's only the beginning for Cheney, a writer, former talk show
pundit and well-known conservative crusader against ''political
correctness'' and nontraditional education. She plans to campaign
full-time with her husband Dick when he separates from Bush on the
campaign trail starting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   She's considering doing fund-raisers; party operatives are eager
to get her on the circuit to capitalize on her popularity among the
party's right wing while Bush courts independents with John McCain
at his side.
</P>
<P>
   Her outspokenness, reputation for independence and passionate
political views have brought comparisons with Hillary Rodham
Clinton, which Cheney says is ''silly and irrelevant'' and took her
by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said Democratic attacks on her husband's voting record --
he voted against a resolution calling, among other things, for
freeing Nelson Mandela from jail and against funding for Head Start
-- were ''a little dismaying and unpleasant,'' and amounted to
''people distorting the facts to gain political points.''
</P>
<P>
   She said her husband's votes had to be viewed in context. ''If
you look at the votes, many of them were about procedural issues''
brought up in a Democratically controlled House.
</P>
<P>
   The scrutiny that began when Bush picked her husband of 35 years
has only intensified. The attention is necessary, expected and
encouraged -- up to a point, said Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Attracting the interest of swing voters who voted for President
Clinton 1992 and 1996 but might not want to vote Democratic this
year was the goal of a three-day, four-state train tour that ended
in Illinois Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's completely exhilarating,'' Cheney said near the end of
the tour after waving at confetti-strewn rallies and shaking hands
with supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said her role will be to travel with her husband and
speak out on education. A former head of the National Endowment for
the Humanities, Cheney has written extensively about her opposition
to nontraditional teaching methods that push aside drills,
memorization and testing in favor of less structured lesson plans.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney and other Republicans -- but also some Democrats -- favor a
return to traditional teaching methods.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, a former policy adviser on education for Bush's campaign
and for the state of Texas, supports the governor's education
platform, which calls for testing kids to measure whether they are
meeting state-set standards of learning.
</P>
<P>
   Schools that don't measure up would lose federal funds and
parents would get federal money that they could use to send kids to
private schools.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of standardized testing say it waters down lessons,
turns off students, hampers teachers creativity and is unfair to
some students.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney counters the formula has worked in Texas, where kids'
test scores are up. ''There's none of this silliness that kids have
the ability to learn things themselves,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The spotlight of the campaign has drawn attention to the Cheney
family, especially daughter Mary, a 31-year-old from Denver who is
gay. Numerous reports in the media have described her work for
Coors Brewery in Colorado, building good will for the company
within minority groups, including gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   Lynne Cheney says she won't discuss the private lives of either
of her daughters -- she has another daughter Elizabeth, a lawyer and
mother of two.
</P>
<P>
   ''But every chance I get I'll also say that they are the most
terrific young women I've ever met and I hope everyone else
realizes ... what good and decent kids they are,'' Cheney said.
</P>
<P>
   Now an unpaid special assistant to her father, Mary Cheney is a
constant presence in her father's sphere of advisers and
strategists.
</P>
<P>
   The two share a passion for fly fishing, a sport that father
introduced his daughter to, said Lynne Cheney, who also tried fly
fishing. But instead of taking to the sport like Mary, she sent a
hook through her husband's earlobe.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Inspect Wildfire Damage  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is inspecting the smoky
wildfires in the West on Tuesday and talking with weary
firefighters who have blistered feet and bloodshot eyes from
battling blazes that have ravaged an area larger than the state of
Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit to the Payette National Forest in west-central
Idaho comes 26 days after a fire broke out there, scorching 23,000
acres -- so far -- of rugged, steep forestland. It is one of 65 fires
burning more than 826,800 acres in 10 states, according to the
National Interagency Fire Center in Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're the worst wildfires in 50 years and the president very
much wanted to go out there and see the people working on them,''
said White House spokesman Jake Siewert.
</P>
<P>
   ''While thanking them, he's going to ask for recommendations on
actions that can be taken to limit the future impact of fires in
rural communities.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 20,000 military and civilian firefighters are
working to contain blazes in Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon,
Utah, Washington, Arizona, California, Colorado and Montana -- the
hardest hit by wildfires in the West.
</P>
<P>
   After taking a helicopter ride to view the damage, Clinton was
to have lunch and make remarks to some of the 1,276 people working
to contain the fire here near McCall, Idaho. The federal
firefighters work for the Forest Service, Bureau of Land
Management, National Park Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs and
Fish and Wildlife Service. There also are federal contract workers
and about 600 soldiers from Fort Hood, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Working 12-hour shifts, they mostly are digging up ground to
create fire lines.
</P>
<P>
   ''You use tools to scrape away anything that might burn so that
what you have left on your trail -- about 3 feet wide -- is bare
soil, which shouldn't burn,'' said Alexis Collins, a spokeswoman
for the Forest Service. ''It creates a fire break.''
</P>
<P>
   Digging fire lines is dirty work, she said, but not as dirty as
the job known as ''mopping up.''
</P>
<P>
   ''These people are digging in the ash, trying to disperse any
coals that are there,'' she said. ''That's real dirty work because
you're right in the ash. You come back black.''

<HEADLINE> Activist To Get Medal of Freedom  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREA CECIL
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Growing up in the 1920s in Iowa, one group of
locals struck a chord so deep within Mildred ''Millie'' Jeffrey
that she never forgot how she felt.
</P>
<P>
   The Ku Klux Klan had a strong following in the Midwest in those
days.
</P>
<P>
   ''I remember the parades,'' Jeffrey said Monday. ''They had a
burning cross, and the men had the hoods over their heads and their
gowns.''
</P>
<P>
   Since there weren't many black in Cherokee, Iowa, for the KKK to
target, they concentrated on Jews and Catholics. Jeffrey said
children threw stones at her because she was the latter.
</P>
<P>
   ''No Catholic could get elected to public office, and I thought
it was very wrong and that's when I became interested in justice
and politics,'' she said. ''And that never left me.''
</P>
<P>
   For her lifetime achievement in such areas, President Clinton
was scheduled to award Jeffrey the Presidential Medal of Freedom on
Wednesday in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey, 88, will be honored along with 14 others, including
former presidential candidate George McGovern, Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, Simon Wiesenthal and the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The medal is the highest civilian award, ranking second only to
the Congressional Medal of Honor, the nation's highest military
award.
</P>
<P>
   It is given to those individuals who have made special
contributions to the security or national interests of the country,
world peace, culture or any other significant arena.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1963 civil rights march that passed through
Montgomery, Ala., Jeffrey walked alongside the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr. The same year, she marched to Jackson, Miss., with James
Meredith, the first black student admitted into the University of
Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   ''White people were shouting epithets. It was very scary,''
Jeffrey said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey was the director of the first woman's United Auto
Workers department. She was the president of the Michigan Women's
Foundation and was on the Wayne State University board of
governors.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Inspect Wildfire Damage  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is inspecting the smoky
wildfires in the West on Tuesday and talking with weary
firefighters who have blistered feet and bloodshot eyes from
battling blazes that have ravaged an area larger than the state of
Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit to the Payette National Forest in west-central
Idaho comes 26 days after a fire broke out there, scorching 23,000
acres -- so far -- of rugged, steep forestland. It is one of 65 fires
burning more than 826,800 acres in 10 states, according to the
National Interagency Fire Center in Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're the worst wildfires in 50 years and the president very
much wanted to go out there and see the people working on them,''
said White House spokesman Jake Siewert.
</P>
<P>
   The president will direct the secretaries of the Interior and
Agriculture departments to make recommendations on ways to
rehabilitate burned land and reduce fire risk to rural communities,
the White House said. He also will release $150 million in
emergency funds to the Agriculture Department for firefighting
efforts, according to a White House statement.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 20,000 military and civilian firefighters are
working to contain blazes in Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon,
Utah, Washington, Arizona, California, Colorado and Montana -- the
hardest hit by wildfires in the West.
</P>
<P>
   After taking a helicopter ride to view the damage, Clinton was
to have lunch and make remarks to some of the 1,276 people working
to contain the fire here near McCall, Idaho. The federal
firefighters work for the Forest Service, Bureau of Land
Management, National Park Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs and
Fish and Wildlife Service. There also are federal contract workers
and about 600 soldiers from Fort Hood, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Working 12-hour shifts, they mostly are digging up ground to
create fire lines.
</P>
<P>
   ''You use tools to scrape away anything that might burn so that
what you have left on your trail -- about 3 feet wide -- is bare
soil, which shouldn't burn,'' said Alexis Collins, a spokeswoman
for the Forest Service. ''It creates a fire break.''
</P>
<P>
   Digging fire lines is dirty work, she said, but not as dirty as
the job known as ''mopping up.''
</P>
<P>
   ''These people are digging in the ash, trying to disperse any
coals that are there,'' she said. ''That's real dirty work because
you're right in the ash. You come back black.''

<HEADLINE> Dangerfield To Release 'My 5 Wives'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Rodney Dangerfield is back and he's feeling
funny.
</P>
<P>
   The comic who became a household name with his ''I get no
respect'' standup banter and on-screen buffoonery has recovered
from heart bypass surgery and is about to release a film called
''My 5 Wives.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I was inspired to write the story because my wife is a Mormon
and I became fascinated with the whole polygamy thing. I thought,
what a great idea for a film,'' he said Monday. ''Polygamy's still
practiced in over 50 countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Set in the fictional town of Redwood Falls, Utah, ''My 5 Wives''
is not about the Mormon religion but instead a lighthearted look at
polygamy. It will be released nationwide Sept. 8.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the advantages of having five wives is they can't all
have a headache at the same time,'' Dangerfield said.
</P>
<P>
   The 78-year-old comic's other movie credits include
''Caddyshack,'' ''Easy Money'' and ''Back to School.''
</P>
<P>
   In March, Dangerfield underwent double bypass surgery in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ''I shook it off,'' Dangerfield said when asked about his
health.

<HEADLINE> Tobey Maguire To Play Spiderman  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Tobey Maguire is now a man in tights.
</P>
<P>
   The droopy-eyed star of such dramas as ''The Cider House
Rules,'' ''The Ice Storm'' and ''Pleasantville'' has been picked to
play Spiderman in the upcoming movie.
</P>
<P>
   Maguire, 25, apparently made a better webcrawler than Freddie
Prinze Jr. or Wes Bentley, both reportedly also in the running to
play the comic book hero on the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   Transforming Maguire into Spiderman hasn't been easy, though.
</P>
<P>
   ''They put some kinda grease on my body and then layer after
layer of this ... stuff. When it hardens, they take it off, and
it's a bit painful 'cause I have hair on my body,'' the actor said

<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- An evening of ''stories, songs and snacks'' at
Carly Simon's house has scored a stack of cash for community
services on Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   An unknown bidder put up $65,000 on Monday for the sit-down with
the artist behind such hits as ''Nobody Does it Better'' and
''Anticipation.'' The event is called the Possible Dreams Auction.
</P>
<P>
   The auction also featured other celebrity offerings, including a
homemade lunch with director Mike Nichols and his wife, Diane
Sawyer, that fetched $28,000.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner with former first lady Lady Bird Johnson went for $8,000.
Actress Mary Steenbergen auctioned off a visit to the set of
''Becker,'' her husband Ted Danson's TV show, for $5,250.
</P>
<P>
   ''She said her husband didn't even know she was doing that,''
said Rebecca Ward, chairwoman of the auction.
</P>
<P>
   A power lunch with Katharine Graham and other top Washington
Post newspaper executives sold for $9,000. The names of the winning

<HEADLINE> Gilligan's Island Case Goes to Trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- After more than 30 years, two creators of
''Gilligan's Island'' are confident of finally being rescued in
their long battle over royalties from the 1960s television show.
</P>
<P>
   Elroy Schwartz, 77, and his writing partner Austin Kalish won a
judge's ruling Monday allowing their case to go to trial. They
claim that Schwartz's older brother, Sherwood Schwartz, cheated
them out of their share of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Sherwood Schwartz claimed the case was litigated
in the 1970s and there was no basis for it being considered again.
But Superior Court Judge David L. Minning rejected the argument
that the statute of limitations had expired.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit alleges fraud and breach of contract and seeks an
accounting of proceeds of the show since the early '70s. Sherwood
Schwartz was the show's producer. Elroy Schwartz and Kalish claim
they wrote most of the pilot script for the series.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're looking forward to righting a wrong,'' said the
Schwartz-Kalish team's attorney, Marc Toberoff.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gilligan's Island,'' which premiered in 1964, was canceled by
CBS in 1967 but has lived on in reruns since then.

   Wall Street got some favorable economic news again this morning.

<P>
   The government says worker productivity rose sharply in the
second quarter, helping put aside any remaining concerns about the
need to raise interest rates further.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some corporate profit concerns the market needs to
work through, before it can move higher.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) --Stocks opened slightly lower Tuesday on
profit-taking after a rally Monday caused by exuberance over the
slowing economy and the growing belief that interest rates will
remain steady.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 6.96 at 10,859.42.

<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 2.72 at 1,476.97, and
the Nasdaq composite index was down 7.64 at 3,855.35. The Russell
2000 index of small companies was unchanged at 509.87.
</P>
<P>
   A report from the Labor Department Tuesday further eased
investors worries over interest rates. Americans' productivity, a
key measure of rising living standards, surged 5.3 percent in the
second quarter, putting productivity gains during the past year at
the fastest pace in 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve has counted on gains in worker productivity
to offset labor shortages that have boosted wages -- a possible
inflationary signal.
</P>
<P>
   The productivity report is one of several recent economic
indicators that show inflation remaining in check.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Leader To Walk Into Iraq  </HEADLINE>
By DIANA ELIAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUWAIT (AP) -- When Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez becomes the
first foreign leader to visit Iraq since the Gulf War, it will be
on foot, ducking a U.N. ban on flying to the isolated country.
</P>
<P>
   The Venezuelan Foreign Ministry confirmed Tuesday that Chavez
would walk across the border from Iran to Iraq as part of his
whirlwind tour of fellow members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, or OPEC.
</P>
<P>
   The Foreign Ministry provided no other details. Until now,
Venezuelan authorities had been closemouthed about the logistics of
a trip that has angered the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from Baghdad, Jose A. Rodrigues de la Sierra, first
secretary of the Venezuelan Embassy, said Chavez will fly to the
Iran-Iraq border Thursday afternoon after meetings with Iranian
leaders, then walk across the frontier near the Iranian border town
of Kermanshah, some 300 miles west of Tehran. It was not clear
whether Chavez would then helicopter or drive to Baghdad, about 200
miles further west.
</P>
<P>
   Without U.N. permission, international flights to and from Iraq
are barred under sanctions imposed to punish it for its 1990
invasion of Kuwait. The invasion was reversed by the U.S.-led Gulf
War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. State Department said Monday it was ''particularly
galling'' that the first such visit is being made by a leader who
was democratically elected.
</P>
<P>
   But Kuwaiti economist Jassem al-Saadoun said Tuesday Chavez's
visit to Iraq should not be blown out of proportion.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a protocol visit,'' al-Saadoun said Tuesday. ''Kuwait has
no objection to anyone visiting Iraq. I believe Kuwait
understands.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuwait's official silence appeared to confirm al-Saadoun's
assessment. Chavez arrived in Kuwait Tuesday for meetings with the
Gulf state's leaders as part of his OPEC tour.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Saadoun said Chavez's trip could have economic benefits if he
is able to persuade OPEC members to stick to a pricing strategy
designed to prevent oil prices from going too low or too high. The
tour is aimed at forging unity among OPEC's fractious members.

<HEADLINE> Koreans Chosen for Family Reunions  </HEADLINE>
By KYONG-HWA SEOK
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Last month, Shin Myong-ja learned her
daughter did not die during the Korean War as she thought, but was
living in North Korea. On Tuesday, another dream came true: Shin,
93, was told her daughter will visit her.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't even remember her face,'' an elated Shin said. Her
daughter, 68-year-old Park Ryang Sun, disappeared during the chaos
of the 1950-53 war.
</P>
<P>
   Shin was told by Red Cross officials that she was among South
Koreans who will meet family members from communist North Korea for
the first time since they were separated a half-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Building on a mood of reconciliation after an unprecedented
summit of their leaders in June, North and South Korea on Tuesday
exchanged the names of 100 people each who will cross their heavily
armed border next week for temporary family reunions in Seoul and
Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   The four-day reunions beginning Aug. 15 are the first since 50
people from each side crossed the border in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Chang Yi-yoon, now 72, was separated from his family 50 years
ago when Korea divided into two nations. The South Korean laborer
learned the amazing news last month that his 109-year-old mother is
alive.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's unbelievable that at that age, my mother is alive. It's
like a dream,'' Chang was quoted as saying by the state Yonhap news
agency.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, he learned he will be allowed to go north to see
her.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will make a deep bow and hold her in a long, warm embrace,''
he has said.
</P>
<P>
   Park Jae-yoon, a 53-year-old South Korean, and two siblings
sobbed when they heard that they their 71-year-old brother, Park
Jae Young, will visit them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what he did for a living. I don't know if he has
a family. And I can't remember what he was like,'' Park Jae-yoon
said.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest Park disappeared during the war. His family in South
Korea learned he was in North Korea in the 1980s through defectors
and other channels, but could not contact him.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Joon-sup, a 66-year-old Seoul resident, bought gifts,
including six watches, two cameras and two calculators, when he
heard he will travel to North Korea to meet a brother and a sister.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't sleep at night. I'm curious and worried whether he'll
recognize me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kim, originally from Pyongyang, was captured by the South Korean
military while fighting for North Korea during the war. Later he
served in the South Korean military.
</P>
<P>
   To increase the chances of reunions, the Koreas had exchanged
the lists of 200 candidates each to check whether long-lost
relatives could be found.
</P>
<P>
   More than 70,000 people in South Korea applied to be reunited
with relatives in the North. Authorities used a computer lottery to
choose 100 finalists.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's list includes a renowned painter, poet, actor,
professor and other well-known people. It is not known how they
were selected, but observers in South Korea have speculated they
were chosen partly for their loyalty to the totalitarian state.
</P>
<P>
   South Koreans who made the cut of 200 candidates but were not
finalists, were deeply disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am old. And I really want to see my daughter. But they say I
can't go,'' said 91-year-old Bang Jin-kwan. His daughter was 5 when
he left her at his brother's home in the North and made the arduous
journey south as a refugee.

   Calling for a global moratorium on cluster bombs, an anti-land
mine group said Tuesday nearly a third of the devices fail to
explode on impact -- remaining potentially lethal to unwary
passers-by.
</P>
<P>
   ''The continued use of cluster bombs has cost thousands of
civilian lives, denied land to the poor ... and is now costing the
international community millions to eradicate'' unexploded devices,
the U.K. Working Group on Land Mines said in a report.
</P>
<P>
   Cluster bombs, composed of scores of small bombs that scatter to
create a wider area of explosion, were used against troops, weapons
and armored vehicles during conflicts in Vietnam, the Persian Gulf
and in NATO's 1999 bombing campaign against Yugoslavia aimed at
ending repression of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In June, U.N. officials trying to clear Kosovo of unexploded
ordnance criticized NATO for failing to provide information about
the location of the devices.
</P>
<P>
   The same month, the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal said it would
not investigate NATO for criminal activity during the Kosovo
campaign. Cluster bombs and weapons using depleted uranium, which
were both denounced by human rights groups, were not banned by
international law, the tribunal said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the bombs are designed to detonate on impact, the U.K.
Working Group on Land Mines said research showed between 9 percent
and 30 percent of the devices failed to do so because of
manufacturing defects and problems with soft landings.
</P>
<P>
   The U.K. Working Group said studies showed up to 12 percent of
British cluster bombs used in Kosovo failed to explode on impact.
The Ministry of Defense said the manufacturer reported that the
failure rate of the British cluster bombs was about 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''The unexploded bomblets effectively turn into land mines,
ready to detonate on contact, causing death and injury to civilians
even many years after the war has ended,'' said Richard Lloyd,
director of the group, which is the British arm of the
International Campaign to Ban Land Mines.
</P>
<P>
   ''As many are brightly colored and the size of a drinks can,
they are particularly attractive to children,'' Lloyd added.
</P>
<P>
   The report concluded that because the weapons failed to
distinguish between soldiers and civilians, their use was
indiscriminate and breached international law.
</P>
<P>
   The working group called for a global moratorium on the use,
manufacture and sale of cluster bombs pending an in-depth review of
their legality and impact.
</P>
<P>
   It said there should be international laws to require nations
using cluster bombs to clear them after a conflict, compensate
injured civilians and hand over full records of cluster bomb
deployment to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   In a report published in June, Britain's Ministry of Defense
said cluster bombs are ''an effective weapon against area targets
such as a group of soft-skinned military vehicles,'' but said it
was testing missiles as a way to target single vehicles more
effectively.

<HEADLINE> Meningitis Outbreaks in Russia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Nearly 350 children have contracted meningitis in
Russia's Far East, and scores have been hospitalized because of the
potentially fatal disease.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-three children were hospitalized Monday in the city of
Komsomolsk-on-Amur, about 3,900 miles east of Moscow, the Emergency
Situations Ministry said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, 127 children were hospitalized with the infection,
which strikes the linings of the brain and spinal cord. An
additional 198 children have been treated and released, ITAR-Tass
said.
</P>
<P>
   The last outbreak on such a scale in the region was in 1991,
when 487 people were afflicted, according to local epidemiologists.
</P>
<P>
   A separate menigitis outbreak was reported in the southern
Russian region of Stavropol, where 32 elementary children have been
hospitalized since July, ITAR-Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
   Outbreaks of contagious diseases have become increasingly common
in Russia because of a lack of funding for medical services.

<HEADLINE> Dow Rises 53; Nasdaq Is Up 5  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose modestly Tuesday after a report
showing rising worker productivity added to the growing belief that
interest rates will remain steady.
</P>
<P>
   At midday on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was
up 53.11 at 10,920.12, adding to Monday's 99-point gain.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were up. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 1.35 at 1,480.67, and the Nasdaq composite index was
up 4.96 at 3,867.46 after rising 75 points Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A report from the Labor Department Tuesday eased investor
worries over interest rates. Americans' productivity, a key measure
of rising living standards, surged 5.3 percent in the second
quarter, putting productivity gains during the past year at the
fastest pace in 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve has counted on gains in worker productivity
to offset labor shortages that have boosted wages -- a possible
inflationary signal.
</P>
<P>
   The productivity report is one of several recent economic
indicators that show that the economy is moderating and inflation
is under control.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks were mixed Tuesday as investors waited for
Cisco Systems' second quarter earnings report to be issued after
the market closed.
</P>
<P>
   Tradding is ''not as robust as I thought it would be given the
strong second-quarter productivity report,'' said John Shaughnessy,
chief investment strategist at Advest Inc. of Hartford, Conn. But
he said investors remain cautious ahead of the retail sales and
producer price index reports due out later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said the productivity report will eventually have a
calming effect on investors nervous about the Fed policymakers
meeting scheduled for Aug. 22. ''With the stronger-than-expected
productivity and increase in hourly earnings around 1 percent
there's good reason for people to be calm,'' Shaughnessy said.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon Communications, the offspring of the Bell Atlantic-GTE
merger that has been struck by communications workers, released
second-quarter earnings that fell short of forecasts. Shares of
Verizon fell $6.125 to $41.
</P>
<P>
   But Priceline.com rose $1.375 to $28.875 and Compaq Computer up
$1.25 to $31.313.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the Dow higher again was Eastman Kodak, up $2.625 at
$60.75 and IBM, up $2 at $118. Retailers also pushed the blue chip
index up with Home Depot rising $2.50 to $57.50 and Wal-Mart
gaining $1 to $56.
</P>
<P>
   Dial fell $1 to $12.125 after the maker of consumer products
said it won't meet analysts' profit forecasts for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 460.21 million
shares, up from Monday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 0.46 at 510.33.

<HEADLINE> OSHA To Review Flight Attendants  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Airline flight attendants were welcoming the
news Tuesday that the Labor Department's workplace safety agency
will look into the hazards of their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Quite frankly, it's about time we were extended the
protections most American workers have enjoyed for decades,'' said
Patricia Friend, international president of the Association of
Flight Attendants, which has been waging a campaign for closer job
safety supervision.
</P>
<P>
   The International Brotherhood of Teamsters also welcomed the
memorandum of understanding signed by the Federal Aviation
Administration and the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''For too long the health and safety of airline workers have
been jeopardized by disputes between these two federal agencies,''
said Teamsters President James P. Hoffa.
</P>
<P>
   The two agencies said they will form a team to review how OSHA
standards on record keeping, bloodborne pathogens, noise,
sanitation, hazard communication, access to employee exposure and
medical records and whistle-blower protection can apply to airline
cabin crews.
</P>
<P>
   The joint team is to report its findings on applicability of
these OSHA requirements by Dec. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Based upon the recommendations, the agencies said, the FAA will
issue a new policy statement on application of OSHA regulations to
flight attendant safety and health.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, OSHA said it will consult with the FAA before proposing
new standards for attendants, to determine whether aviation safety
would be affected.
</P>
<P>
   While OSHA safety and health standards apply to most American
workers, airline crews have been under the jurisdiction of the FAA.
Under the new agreement, FAA will continue to be responsible for
flight-deck crew such as pilots and co-pilots, and OSHA will
continue to enforce its standards for other aviation industry
employees, such as maintenance and ground support personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The Association of Flight Attendants, which represents 47,000
workers at 26 airlines, has been particularly critical of the high
injury rate for flight attendants.
</P>
<P>
   The association reported that a review of illness and injury
logs at 11 airlines covering 31,024 flight attendants in 1998
showed that 10 percent reported injuries requiring follow-up
medical attention or causing them to lose time from work. By
comparison, the national average for such injuries is 3.1 percent,
the AFA said, citing data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Major sources of injuries for flight attendants, the group said,
include:
</P>
<P>
   --Food and beverage carts that can weigh up to 500 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   --Cuts and burns from galley equipment and oven racks.
</P>
<P>
   --Slipping on galley floors and icy walkways.
</P>
<P>
   --Handling or being struck by oversized and overweight carry-on
baggage.
</P>
<P>
   --Exposure to potentially infected blood when providing in-flight
emergency medical treatment including mouth-to-mouth resuscitation,
without the proper equipment or medical follow-up.

<HEADLINE> China Closes Polluting Company  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- China said Tuesday it shut down a state-run metal
company that for years spewed enormous amounts of sulfur dioxide
and other pollutants into the air.
</P>
<P>
   The Shenyang Smeltery is China's first large government
enterprise to be closed because of pollution, the state-run Xinhua
News Agency said. It was closed in June.
</P>
<P>
   The factory, in an industrialized part of northeast China,
discharged 74,000 tons of sulfur dioxide and 67 tons of heavy
metals annually, Xinhua said.
</P>
<P>
   The factory polluted about 20 square miles of Shenyang and
produced 42 percent of the sulfur dioxide found in the city, once
among the 10 most polluted in the world, Xinhua said.
</P>
<P>
   Residents suffered health problems, and area officials appealed
repeated to the central government for help, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can breathe some fresh air from now on,'' Xinhua quoted
resident Liu Shuying as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1936, the Shenyang Smeltery was among China's top 500
state-owned enterprises in the 1980s, refining gold, silver,
copper, lead and zinc.

<HEADLINE> Meeting Discusses Anti-Smoking Plans  </HEADLINE>
By MARTHA IRVINE
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Thousands of health and other professionals have
gathered this week to tackle a long-standing question: What's the
best way to get people to quit smoking?
</P>
<P>
   It is a daunting task for officials meeting in Chicago for the
11th World Conference on Tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Harvard College Alcohol Survey has found more
evidence that U.S. college students continue to experiment with
many forms of tobacco. The 1999 survey -- published in Wednesday's
Journal of the American Medical Association and released at the
conference -- found that nearly 46 percent of students tried
cigarettes, cigars and other tobacco products. Nearly a third were
using tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide estimates of smoking-related deaths are no more
heartening.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the conference say smoking will contribute to the
deaths of 4 million people this year. If unchecked, they say those
deaths will increase to 10 million in 2030.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gro Harlem Brundtland told a room full of the conference's
4,500 attendees that such figures should motivate ''a truly global
debate'' on the tobacco issue.
</P>
<P>
   Brundtland, director-general of the World Health Organization,
also called for a unified anti-smoking approach: high cigarette
taxes bolstered by hard-hitting anti-smoking ads, a ban on smoking
in public places and increased access to programs that help smokers
quit.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know what works,'' she said. By doing what works, ''we save
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, some countries are taking action. In Norway, a pack of
cigarettes costs more than $7, mostly due to taxes. In Canada,
federal law requires cigarette packs to carry graphic images,
including photos of a smoker's deteriorated lungs, heart or gums.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Brundtland said, the WHO also plans to start work on
a treaty for its 190 member countries. The treaty will seek to
prevent the sale of cheaper, smuggled cigarettes and share
anti-smoking campaigns and education materials with developing
countries, which account for about 70 percent of smoking-related
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   An American Cancer Society study prepared for the conference
found that, of 196 countries monitored, about half prohibit the
sale of cigarettes to minors and only about a third have access to
pharmaceutical treatments for nicotine dependence.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, about a third of those countries have health warnings
on their cigarette packs, with Canada's among the most graphic.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel the cigarette pack is the No. 1 tool to reaching
smokers and their families,'' said Norman Brown, director of
regulations and compliance for that country's Tobacco Control
Programme.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said Canadian health officials decided to use the
''larger, full-color and graphic'' images because written warnings
on cigarette packs are beginning to lose their effect. He also said
that, while the number of smoking Canadians has dropped in the last
five years, the number of young people who've start smoking has
increased slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone at the conference believes high cigarette taxes and
anti-smoking campaigns will be enough to get people to stop
smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Lars Ramstrom, director of the Institute for Tobacco Studies in
Sweden, said chewing tobacco may help hard-core smokers quit.
</P>
<P>
   Ramstrom said a study found that ''snus'' -- a moist, unfermented
chewing tobacco popular in the Scandinavian country -- helped
smokers quit. He said early studies indicate that smoking tobacco
is much more harmful to one's health than chewing it.
</P>
<P>
   Some health professionals, especially those who treat tobacco
chewers for cancers of the mouth, were troubled by Ramstrom's
suggestion. But he said it was unrealistic to think everyone can
quit ''cold turkey.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The real world shows us that's not the only way to go,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Russian Defense Ministry Probed  </HEADLINE>
By ANNA DOLGOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- The Russian military prosecutor's office said
Tuesday it is investigating the Defense Ministry for possible
embezzlement of $450 million -- an amount equal to nearly one-tenth
of the ministry's 2000 budget.
</P>
<P>
   Russian media reports have said that the Defense Ministry wired
the money to a British-based company called United Energy
International Ltd. in 1995 and 1996. The British company is a
co-founder of Ukraine's energy monopoly, and the money was to pay
for supplies of unspecified military and technical equipment from
Ukraine, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
   It was unknown if any of the equipment was ever delivered.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman at the main Russian military prosecutor's office,
Sergei Ushakov, said a criminal probe was opened in March to trace
the money. Ushakov would not confirm reports the funds were
transferred to United Energy, saying that it was unclear where they
were sent.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could have been a commercial deal, or it could have been a
criminal deal,'' Ushakov said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the money could have been embezzled after it left
the Defense Ministry, which may have acted in good faith. ''There
is such a thing as commercial risk,'' Ushakov said.
</P>
<P>
   The Moscow Times daily reported that the Defense Ministry's 2000
budget is $5 billion -- compared with about $268 billion in the
United States. If the $450 million turns out to have been stolen,
it would be a fraud case of an unprecedented scale for the Russian
Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Corruption is endemic in the Russian military, but no
well-organized, large-scale embezzlement at the ministry has been
reported in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The Interfax news agency said that suspects include the head of
the ministry's finance department Col. Gen. Georgy Oleinik, the
department's chief accountant Maj. Gen. Yevgeny Datsko, and two
other high-ranking finance officials, Maj. Gen. Anatoly Vorobyov
and Maj. Gen. Leonid Gerasimenko.
</P>
<P>
   Oleinik joined the finance department in 1996, making it unclear
what role he could have played in the alleged fraud scheme,
according to the Moscow Times.

<HEADLINE> Oasis Forced To Flee Stage  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- It was an encore performance for the
British rock group Oasis.
</P>
<P>
   For the second time in two weeks, the group was forced to flee a
stage Sunday night when it was pelted with plastic bottles and
other objects before a crowd of 30,000 at the Sudoeste festival.
</P>
<P>
   Oasis, currently on a world tour, also cut a concert short at a
Swiss rock festival last month after concertgoers threw bottles and
cans on stage.
</P>
<P>
   Oasis blamed the latest incident on a small group of
troublemakers, but festival producers blamed the disruption on the
band.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a problem with Oasis's attitude,'' producers Musica no
Coracao said. ''They didn't try to calm people down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Daily Publico newspaper claimed lead singer Liam Gallagher
lost his temper because the crowd would not join in singing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Due to Liam's tantrum, the hostility of a small section of the
audience spread and became general contempt,'' the newspaper's
critic wrote.

<HEADLINE> Saddam Criticizes Gulf Neighbors  </HEADLINE>
By LEON BARKHO
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- President Saddam Hussein kept up Iraq's
drumbeat of criticism of its Persian Gulf neighbors Tuesday, saying
they had ''sold their souls'' to the United States and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam made the comments in a nationally-televised speech
marking the end of Iraq's 1980-1988 war with Iran. The speech
followed several days of anti-Kuwait editorials in Iraq's
state-controlled press.
</P>
<P>
   Last week was the 10th anniversary of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
A U.S.-led coalition forced Iraq to retreat from Kuwait, and also
strengthened military ties between the West and other Gulf states.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whatever (Gulf states) find salable they have sold to the
United States and Zionism .... It is they who have sold their souls
and have appointed (the occupying foreigner) to rule over
everything,'' Saddam said.
</P>
<P>
   ''May evil befall them, for evil indeed are the deeds they do,''
he said, naming Saudi Arabia but not specifically mentioning
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   The state-run Kuwait News Agency said Tuesday that threats from
Iraq ''will not scare Kuwait and the civilized community.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the Iraqi newspaper Babel, owned by Saddam's eldest son,
warned Kuwaiti rulers that Iraq is still capable of teaching them
''an additional lesson.''

<HEADLINE> Spain Kills 2,400 Sick Sheep  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Authorities in a northern province said
Tuesday they had destroyed 2,400 sheep after detecting Spain's
first cases of scrapie, an ailment similar to mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
   The animals came from farms in two towns in the Navarra region.
They were sacrificed in June after tests on 12 sheep revealed three
cases of scrapie, the Navarra agriculture department said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials plan to destroy another 400 sheep in the next few
days, Navarra agricultural spokesman Javier Errea said.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish Agriculture Ministry confirmed that these were the
first known cases of scrapie in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Scrapie is a fatal neurological ailment similar to mad cow
disease. Both are believed to be caused by a defective form of
brain protein, called a prion.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms in sheep include trembling, loss of coordination and
scraping against objects.
</P>
<P>
   Veterinarians say scrapie was first diagnosed 250 years ago in
Britain and other western European countries. It is relatively
common among sheep.
</P>
<P>
   There are no known cases of its being transmitted directly to
humans. But an outbreak in Britain in the 1980s of mad cow disease
-- which scientists now say does jump the species barrier -- has been
blamed on the practice of feeding cattle the ground up remains of
scrapie-infected sheep. The European Union has since banned that
practice.

quarter, putting productivity gains during the past year at the
fastest pace in 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve has counted on gains in worker productivity
to offset labor shortages that have boosted wages -- a possible
inflationary signal.
</P>
<P>
   The productivity report is one of several recent economic
indicators that show that the economy is moderating and inflation
is under control.

   Technology stocks were mixed Tuesday as investors waited for
Cisco Systems' second quarter earnings report to be issued after
the market closed. Shares of Cisco were down 75 cents to $65.50.
</P>
<P>
   Trading is ''not as robust as I thought it would be given the
strong second-quarter productivity report,'' said John Shaughnessy,
chief investment strategist at Advest Inc. of Hartford, Conn. But
he said investors remain cautious ahead of the retail sales and
producer price index reports due out later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said the productivity report will eventually have a
calming effect on investors nervous about the Fed policymakers
meeting scheduled for Aug. 22. ''With the stronger-than-expected
productivity and increase in hourly earnings around 1 percent
there's good reason for people to be calm,'' Shaughnessy said.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon Communications, the offspring of the Bell Atlantic-GTE

   Leading the Dow higher was Eastman Kodak, up $3 at $61 and IBM,
up $2.375 at $118.75. Retailers also pushed the blue chip index up
with Home Depot rising $3 to $58 and Wal-Mart gaining $1.625 to
$56.625.
</P>
<P>
   Dial fell $1 to $12.125 after the maker of consumer products

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Leader To Go to Iraq  </HEADLINE>
By DIANA ELIAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUWAIT (AP) -- When Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez becomes the
first foreign leader to visit Iraq since the Gulf War, it will be
by car, ducking a U.N. ban on flying to the isolated country.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela's foreign minister, Jose Vicente Rangel, said Tuesday
in Caracas that Chavez will cross the border from Iran by car, not
by foot as Foreign Ministry officials had said earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez is on a whirlwind tour of fellow members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from Baghdad, Jose A. Rodrigues de la Sierra, first
secretary of the Venezuelan Embassy, said Chavez will fly to the
Iran-Iraq border Thursday afternoon after meetings with Iranian
leaders, then cross the frontier near the Iranian border town of
Kermanshah, 300 miles west of Tehran. It was not clear whether
Chavez would then helicopter or drive to Baghdad, about 200 miles
further west.
</P>
<P>
   Without U.N. permission, international flights to and from Iraq
are barred under sanctions imposed to punish it for its 1990
invasion of Kuwait. The invasion was reversed by the U.S.-led Gulf
War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. State Department said Monday it was ''particularly
galling'' that the first such visit is being made by a leader who
was democratically elected.
</P>
<P>
   But Kuwaiti economist Jassem al-Saadoun said Chavez's visit to
Iraq should not be blown out of proportion.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a protocol visit,'' al-Saadoun said. ''Kuwait has no
objection to anyone visiting Iraq. I believe Kuwait understands.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuwait's official silence appeared to confirm al-Saadoun's
assessment. Chavez arrived in Kuwait on Tuesday for meetings with
the Gulf state's leaders as part of his OPEC tour.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Saadoun said Chavez's trip could have economic benefits if he
is able to persuade OPEC members to stick to a pricing strategy
designed to prevent oil prices from going too low or too high. The
tour is aimed at forging unity among OPEC's fractious members.

<HEADLINE> Tension High on West Bank  </HEADLINE>
By DINA KRAFT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELON MOREH, West Bank (AP) -- In this Jewish settlement,
residents run home guard drills, fearful they may one day be
overrun by Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   In the neighboring Palestinian village of Salim, Palestinians
keep their herds locked up so they don't have to venture to
outlying pastures, site of recent clashes with armed settlers from
Elon Moreh in a land dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Fear and friction, always part of life in the contested West
Bank, are intensifying as Israel and the Palestinians try to
conclude a land-for-peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   Many settlers feel besieged. ''People are talking about war,''
said Mikki Miller-Mendelson, a mother of eight, of concerns the
settlements could one day be attacked by large numbers of
Palestinians. Miller-Mendelson's husband was killed by Palestinian
militants in a 1991 shooting near the settlement of Dolev.
</P>
<P>
   At Elon Moreh -- located near Nablus, a Palestinian city with a
population more than 100 times the settlement of 1,200 -- defiance
was the message. ''We will never leave,'' proclaimed a larger
banner fluttering above rows of red-roofed homes.
</P>
<P>
   In Salim, in the valley below, Khaled Ishtaya, the mukhtar, or
village elder, nervously fingered brown worry beads as he recited a
litany of complaints against Elon Moreh. Settlers have stolen
sheep, uprooted olive trees, threatened Salim residents at
gunpoint, Ishtaya said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There must be peace but with these people we can know no
peace. They are thieves -- land thieves,'' said Ishtaya, 52.
</P>
<P>
   Villagers said that over the weekend, settlers carrying sticks
and pistols attacked three Salim shepherds grazing their flock on a
disputed hillside. The shepherds fled, leaving some 400 sheep
behind.
</P>
<P>
   One of the shepherds who said he was beaten had stitches on his
nose and rolled up his sleeve to reveal a purple welt of bruises.
</P>
<P>
   Salim residents say the hill belongs to them, part of an expanse
of pastures they have used for generations. The settlers contend
the hilltop is within the settlement's municipal boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, there was a second clash between stone-throwing
villagers and gun-toting settlers. At one point, Lt. Col. Baruch
Yedid, the Israeli commander in charge of coordinating local
security activity with the Palestinian Authority, was wrestled to
the ground by two young settlers.
</P>
<P>
   Yedid said he was hit with a club on the neck, choked and kicked
in the back. Leaders of Elon Moreh blamed Yedid, saying the officer
has a history of siding with the Palestinians and provoked the
settlers.
</P>
<P>
   Amichai Remer, 30, who deals with security at Elon Moreh, also
dismissed the Palestinians' complaints. No trees have been
uprooted, no weapons waved, no sheep or donkeys stolen, Remer said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Palestinians have become more brazen because of
progress toward a land-for-peace treaty at Camp David last month.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has offered to hand over more
than 90 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians, and has said
at least 20 percent of the 200,000 settlers will not come under
Israeli sovereignty, meaning they either have to leave their homes
or live under Palestinian rule.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing a final peace deal, settlers have re-established several
rogue outposts in recent weeks in an attempt to prevent the
territory from being handed over to the Palestinians. The Haaretz
daily said Tuesday that at nine sites, settlers have set up mobile
homes, paved roads and poured cement foundations.
</P>
<P>
   Settlers say a previous deal with Barak to refrain from
unauthorized construction is off because of the concessions he made
to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the prime minister who has broken the agreement in a
flagrant manner,'' said Bentzy Lieberman, a settler leader.
</P>
<P>
   Remer said the threat to settlements has grown since Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   Settlers are preparing for the possibility large numbers of
Palestinians might storm the Israeli enclaves, running self-defense
drills and stockpiling weapons in coordination with the Israeli
army. At Dolev, residents have been told to hoard supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone has an assignment, everyone knows what to do. Some
will handle weaponry, others will direct the operation,'' Remer
said.
</P>
<P>
   In neighboring Salim, residents are trying to stay clear of the
settlers.
</P>
<P>
   Maruf Ishtaya, 60, is keeping his sheep at home so his son won't
become a target in the pastures. ''I'm scared for my son who was
attacked Saturday, afraid they (the settlers) will kill him.''

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Court Acquits Serb Family  </HEADLINE>
By ALISON MUTLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   GNJILANE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- In a case that was closely watched
as a test of the judicial system in Kosovo, a court on Tuesday
cleared a Serb father and his two sons of murdering an ethnic
Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   The man died in a July 1999 gun battle involving U.S. soldiers,
and an Army sergeant testified Monday that he shot at an ethnic
Albanian who was firing at U.S. troops that day. The five-member
panel of judges ruled there wasn't enough evidence to convict the
three men of killing Afrim Gagica.
</P>
<P>
   Mirolub Momcilovic, 60, dropped his head in relief when the
verdict was announced, and hugged his sons, Boban, 25, and
Jugoslav, 32. Boban burst into tears.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm happy to be free,'' he said. ''I didn't kill that guy.''
</P>
<P>
   However, because prosecutors have 15 days to appeal, the father
and sons were returned to the U.S. Army's detention facility at
Camp Bondsteel to await further court action. They have been
incarcerated since the July 10, 1999, shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The three Serbs were convicted of illegal firearms possession,
but were sentenced to time served.
</P>
<P>
   The case against the three Serbs had cast doubt on whether
minorities could get a fair trial in Kosovo's ethnically-charged
courts. It drew attention because the events leading up to Gagica's
slaying were captured on videotape surveillance cameras outside the
family's home.
</P>
<P>
   Though the tape did not show who shot Gagica, U.S. soldiers are
heard on the tape arriving at the scene. Defense attorneys argued
it was unclear who fired the fatal shot.
</P>
<P>
   The initial U.S. Army report of the incident found that Gagica
and others had come to the Momcilovic home ''with criminal
intent.'' Nevertheless, the father and sons were charged with
murder and the trial began in April.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until a year after the trial began that it surfaced
that American soldiers had shot at a man in a shed where Gagica was
hunkered down.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations quickly praised the acquittal. U.N.
spokeswoman Susan Manuel cited the presence of French judge Patrice
de Charette in the ruling by a panel with a majority of ethnic
Albanian judges.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do feel that the presence of the international judge helped
justice to be served,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Attacks on minorities in Kosovo have persisted despite the
presence of thousands of NATO-led peacekeepers who took over
control of the province after a 78-day air war against Yugoslavia
in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Japan 'Millionaire' Quiz Show Flops  </HEADLINE>
By GARY SCHAEFER
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese TV producers have long had a simple rule
of thumb regarding programming: If something's big in the United
States, it will probably work here as well. And this show seemed
like a sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Quiz $ Millionaire'' is modeled after America's most-watched
game show right down to the drum rolls, offering contestants more
cash than anything else on the air.
</P>
<P>
   But the Japanese version of ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?''
has turned out to be a ratings bust, providing a case study in how
Japanese tastes -- some might even say morals -- differ from those
across the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of ''Quiz $ Millionaire'' has surprised even media
insiders because the Japanese have long had an insatiable appetite
for U.S. pop culture. From baggy jeans to roller blades, just about
anything that's a hit in America is a hit here.
</P>
<P>
   So why hasn't the show been able to attract an audience, despite
a 10 million yen jackpot -- about $108,000 -- billed as the biggest
in the history of Japanese TV?
</P>
<P>
   It seems that watching ordinary people winning extraordinary
amounts of money isn't very enticing in Japan, a culture that has
traditionally discouraged individuals from flaunting their wealth
or achievements, says one media observer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Japan is like one big village,'' said Mamoru Sakamoto, editor
of the TV monthly Galac. ''Americans may really identify with
somebody winning big bucks on TV, but Japanese are more apt to
think, 'What did he do to deserve that?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the formula in Japan has been short on cash and heavy
on laughs. And instead of average people, the contestants in
Japanese game shows tend to be TV celebrities who don't need prizes
and who know how to yuk it up on camera.
</P>
<P>
   ''Game shows are supposed to be a form of entertainment, and the
average person just isn't very entertaining,'' said Tomohiro
Maruyama, an accountant in his 30s.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, another catch.
</P>
<P>
   The prize money is limited to 10 million yen by the country's
antitrust laws, originally intended to prevent companies with deep
pockets from using high-stakes contests to woo customers away from
their competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ''Re-creating the same level of excitement with much less money
at stake is difficult,'' said Fuji TV executive Matsunori
Takahashi.
</P>
<P>
   Still, money has never been the name of the game in Japan. That
honor is reserved for weirdness.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's hottest game show is ''Tokyo Friend Park II,'' which
features a pair of celebrities competing in a series of oddball
events -- like flinging themselves against a wall-sized Velcro
target to see who sticks (''Wall Crash'') or trying not to drop
precariously balanced boxes of take-out food while riding a
motorbike simulator (''Delivery Deluxe'').
</P>
<P>
   The prizes for completing these odd tasks are often just tokens.
For example, after sweating through a recent episode of ''Tokyo
Friend Park II'', popular sumo wrestler Takatoriki was rewarded
with a triple-decker bunk bed for his kids.
</P>
<P>
   And for those game shows that do feature average people as
contestants, it is more often comic relief than gratuitous wealth
on offer.
</P>
<P>
   One, called ''Happy Family Plan,'' gives fathers a chance to win
a showcase of prizes worth 3 million yen for the whole family by
mastering an improbable mental or physical feat in a week's time.
</P>
<P>
   Many don't win, but the fun comes from watching home video
footage of overworked Japanese company men trying to memorize the
flags of all 185 countries of the world, or figuring out how to
scoop up a school of goldfish with a tissue-paper net.
</P>
<P>
   Fuji TV, which bought the rights to ''Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire?'' from Celador Productions, hasn't given up on ''Quiz
$ Millionaire.'' But getting contestants to go all the way hasn't
been easy.
</P>
<P>
   It took more than three months for somebody to finally win 10
million yen. Middle school teacher Yasuyuki Kunimitsu, 26, became
the first contestant to answer all 15 questions correctly on an
episode broadcast July 27.
</P>
<P>
   Many other contestants drop out of the all-or-nothing game after
winning much less.
</P>
<P>
   ''Japanese people tend to be conservative when it comes to
money,'' said producer Toshihiko Matsuo. ''If they win 5 million
yen on the show, they probably figure, 'I might as well quit while
I'm ahead and work for the rest.''

<HEADLINE> China Boots Official for Corruption  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- China expelled a provincial bureaucrat from the
ruling Communist Party after authorities discovered he used his
power to put friends and relatives in government posts, state-run
media said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Zhou Wenji also lost his job as deputy chairman of the Ningxia
branch of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, a
government advisory body, Xinhua News agency said. Ningxia is a
remote northwestern province.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of Zhou's disgrace comes amid a nationwide
anti-corruption campaign that the Communist Party has launched to
try to restore public confidence in the government.
</P>
<P>
   A disciplinary committee discovered that Zhou used his influence
to have 15 of his relatives, including his children, brother and
wife, and over 100 former colleagues given government posts in
Ningxia province.
</P>
<P>
   The committee said Zhou overstepped his authority by directly
approving or asking others to approve the appointments even though
most of the candidates were unqualified, according to Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
   ''He damaged the image of the Communist Party and the
government,'' Xinhua quoted the committee as saying. ''Let his case
serve as a lesson to other leaders.''

<HEADLINE> Lebanon To Deploy Forces in South  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Lebanon announced Tuesday it will begin
deploying its security forces in southern Lebanon, an area
patrolled by Shiite Muslim guerrillas since Israel's withdrawal in
May.
</P>
<P>
   The force of 1,000 Lebanese soldiers and policemen will begin
fanning out in ''liberated areas'' at dawn Wednesday, Interior
Minister Michel Murr said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. peacekeepers moved into the zone Saturday -- a step Lebanon
had made a prerequisite for its own deployment -- but tension
continues to simmer and has drawn warnings from Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Four people were wounded in the zone Sunday and Monday when
Israeli soldiers fired at stone-throwers and youths preparing to
hurl a firebomb over the border fence.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh said Tuesday he
doubted the Lebanese government really intended to take control
from the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   ''What has to worry us is whether it will be a genuine
deployment or a make-believe deployment, and at present the
impression is that it will be a make-believe deployment,'' Sneh
told reporters on a visit to the Israeli side of the border.
</P>
<P>
   Murr said Saturday there would be no armed guerrilla presence in
the area after the Lebanese forces were deployed.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said Tuesday that armed members of the most active
guerrilla group, the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, still manned some
positions in the zone. But guerrillas were seen removing banners
and signs from some positions Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas have pledged to cooperate with the Lebanese
authorities after the Israeli withdrawal. Hezbollah's leader, Sheik
Hassan Nasrallah, has said his fighters would not serve as a
substitute for the government in maintaining law and order in the
zone.
</P>
<P>
   Murr has said the 500 soldiers and 500 policemen will be under
the Interior Ministry's command and their job will be to maintain
law and order in the zone. They will be joining a few hundred
policemen deployed shortly after Israel's May 24 withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   He said Lebanese security forces will not deploy along the
border, saying that job is for the U.N. peacekeepers. Lebanon has
repeatedly refused to send troops from its 75,000-strong army to
its southern frontier, saying it does not want to serve as Israel's
border guard.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese deployment appears to be a token force for a region
that covers 10 percent of Lebanon and has seen bloody conflict for
nearly 30 years. It seems designed to meet U.N. and Western demands
that the government show a semblance of authority in southern
Lebanon and pave the way for foreign aid for the reconstruction of
the war-ravaged south.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to deploy was made Tuesday after a meeting of
senior Lebanese army officers and the U.N. peacekeeping force.

<HEADLINE> 14 Killed in Clash in Angola  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUANDA, Angola (AP) -- A three-hour gunbattle between rebel
forces and government troops just east of the capital left 10
rebels and four civilians dead, the government said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the rebel group UNITA attacked at dawn Monday in the
town of Catete, 30 miles east of the Angolan capital, Luanda,
according to an armed forces statement. There was no information on
government casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Before fleeing, the rebels looted a World Food Program warehouse
and held 150 civilians hostage, a according to Radio Ecclesia. The
rebels also targeted military posts and local government buildings,
Ecclesia said, citing an army official.
</P>
<P>
   A power outage occurred in large areas of Luanda at about the
same time as the Catete attack and continued Tuesday afternoon.
Local power company spokesman Joao Simao said the army was using a
helicopter to look for evidence of sabotaged power lines.
</P>
<P>
   There was no comment from the rebel group UNITA, a
Portuguese-language acronym for the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola.
</P>
<P>
   The government and UNITA have engaged in low-level fighting
since the army ousted the rebels from their central highland
strongholds after months of conventional warfare around major
provincial cities.
</P>
<P>
   Angola's civil war began after independence from Portugal in
1975. A 4-year-old peace pact unraveled and fighting restarted in
December 1998.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Says Spy Probe Nears End  </HEADLINE>
By SALAH NASRAWI
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Responding to criticism from international
human rights groups, a prosecutor said Tuesday that an
Egyptian-American academic jailed since June has not been formally
charged and the investigation would end soon.
</P>
<P>
   Rights groups and the U.S. government had expressed concern over
the case of Saad Eddin Ibrahim, a sociology professor at the
American University in Cairo. Ibrahim's lawyer said Sunday that
prosecutors had accused his client of ''espionage for the United
States to undermine Egypt's national security and harm its
military, economic and political interests.''
</P>
<P>
   The attorney, Farid el-Dib, also said no formal charges had been
filed and called the allegations ''a farce.''
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual move, prosecutor-general Maher Abdel Wahid issued
a statement Tuesday saying no charges had been brought against
Ibrahim ''pending an end to questioning and gathering of
evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement left unclear whether the investigation could
eventually result in formal espionage charges. Abdel Wahid has in
the past refused to comment on the case, despite local newspapers
reporting a variety of allegations against Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
   In their questioning, prosecutors reportedly have accused
Ibrahim of several offenses, including that he accepted foreign
money without government permission and forged ballots for a
documentary film about elections that allegedly would have
tarnished Egypt's image.
</P>
<P>
   El-Dib said Tuesday that higher officials may have requested
Abdel Wahid back away from the espionage accusations because they
were politically sensitive and involved a key Egyptian ally -- the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   El-Dib said he saw the prosecutor's statement as a ''partial
retraction.'' He urged prosecutors to make formal charges ''if they
have any.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Egyptian law, Ibrahim can be held for up to six months
without charge.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the U.S. State Department urged Egypt to free
Ibrahim, saying he may have been detained because of his advocacy
for human rights.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 72; Nasdaq Falls 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly higher Tuesday after a report
showing rising worker productivity bolstered the growing belief
that interest rates will remain steady.
</P>
<P>
   In late afternoon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 71.79 at 10,937.34, adding to Monday's 99-point
gain.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 4.62 at 1,483.94, and the Nasdaq composite index was
down 2.28 at 3,860.71 after rising 75 points Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A report from the Labor Department Tuesday eased investor
worries over interest rates. Americans' productivity, a key measure
of rising living standards, surged 5.3 percent in the second
quarter, putting productivity gains during the past year at the
fastest pace in 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve has counted on gains in worker productivity
to offset labor shortages that have boosted wages -- a possible
inflationary signal. The productivity report is one of several
recent economic indicators that show that the economy is moderating
and inflation is under control.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks were mixed Tuesday as investors waited for
Cisco Systems' second-quarter earnings report to be issued after
the market closed. Shares of Cisco were down 50 cents at $65.
</P>
<P>
   Trading is ''not as robust as I thought it would be given the
strong second-quarter productivity report,'' said John Shaughnessy,
chief investment strategist at Advest Inc. of Hartford, Conn. But
he said investors remain cautious ahead of the retail sales and
producer price index reports due out later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said the productivity report will eventually have a
calming effect on investors nervous about the Fed policymakers
meeting scheduled for Aug. 22. ''With the stronger-than-expected
productivity and increase in hourly earnings around 1 percent
there's good reason for people to be calm,'' Shaughnessy said.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon Communications, the offspring of the Bell Atlantic-GTE
merger that has been struck by communications workers, released
second-quarter earnings that fell short of forecasts. Shares of
Verizon fell $5.375 to $42.50.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft rose $4 to $74.25 and Compaq Computer rose $1.25
to $31.313.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the Dow higher was Eastman Kodak, up $3 at $61 and IBM,
up $2.375 at $118.75. Retailers also pushed the blue chip index up
with Home Depot rising $3 to $58 and Wal-Mart gaining $2.625 to
$57.343.
</P>
<P>
   Dial fell $1 to $12.125 after the maker of consumer products
said it won't meet analysts' profit forecasts for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 791.00 million
shares, up from Monday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 0.22 at 509.65.

<HEADLINE> Germans Move To Dump Nazis From Web  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL GEITNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Germany moved Tuesday to block Nazi slogans as
German Web addresses after discovering someone had registered
www.heil-hitler.de. But officials worried about rising neo-Nazi
violence concede there's little they can do about sites based
elsewhere in cyberspace -- especially the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative comes as Germans search for ways to combat a wave
of neo-Nazi activity, ranging from vandalism at Jewish cemeteries
to attacks on minorities that have left three people dead so far
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Minister Herta Daeubler-Gmelin said her office
approached Denic, the Frankfurt-based cooperative for issuing
Internet addresses in Germany, to remove the Nazi slogan, which is
illegal in Germany, and to prevent other such sites from getting
online.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've looked at the guidelines, and one can pull these things
if there's a clear violation of the law,'' Daeubler-Gmelin said on
WDR broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   Denic and the Berlin-based Internet service provider involved,
Strato AG, both said the application -- like thousands of others
daily -- had been handled by fully automated systems without being
checked.
</P>
<P>
   ''With 200,000 reservations a month, it's not possible to do it
any other way,'' said Denic spokesman Klaus Herzig.
</P>
<P>
   But the justice minister said such arguments were unconvincing,
and that a means for blocking ''anti-Semitic, racist or other kinds
of clearly Nazi or otherwise provocative words'' had to be found.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe there's absolutely no worry here about having to
face charges of censorship either,'' she said, adding that her
office would help draw up a list of names to be banned.
</P>
<P>
   The simmering problem of rising neo-Nazi activity was pushed
onto front pages two weeks ago after a bombing at a train station
in Duesseldorf injured 10 recent immigrants, including six Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Another bomb was defused Monday outside the home of a former
local Jewish community leader in the southern town of Bamberg, and
as in Duesseldorf, police said they were not ruling out neo-Nazi
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder interrupted his vacation Monday
night to issue a call for using the ''full force of the law''
against right-wing extremists. Opposition lawmakers proposed
creating special courts to hold fast-track trials for anyone
charged with neo-Nazi crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Tennis legend Boris Becker, who once threatened to leave his
home country because of racist slurs against his wife, indicated he
would join a new ''Show Your Face'' publicity campaign against
right-wing extremism.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't do enough'' to combat intolerance and violence, said
Becker, whose wife is the daughter of a black American.
</P>
<P>
   The person who applied for the www.heil-hitler.de site was
identified by Denic officials only as Ralf K., from the small town
of Dabel, north of Berlin near the Baltic coast. The Bild tabloid
said he was a 28-year-old staff sergeant in the German army and had
denied any connection with the site.
</P>
<P>
   The domain name -- including ''de'' for Deutschland, the German
word for Germany -- was entered Thursday but no page was ever
created.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Frankfurt newspaper that first reported the
site, attempts have been made in recent weeks to register other
provocative names such as the German equivalent of
''kill-all-foreigners'' or ''KZ'' -- the German initials for
concentration camp.
</P>
<P>
   Those sites have been blocked, the Frankfurter Allgemeine
Zeitung reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Strato spokesman Soeren Heinze said whoever ordered the
heil-hitler.de domain name may have been reserving it to prevent
neo-Nazis from using the address. An anti-fascist group blocked
www.nsdap.de -- the German initials for the Nazi party -- by putting
up its own nonsense pages, for example.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S.-registered site, www.heil-hitler.com, brings up a Web
page for Namezero.com, a Silicon Valley company that provides free
commercial domain names for individuals and small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   German authorities reported in April that far-right extremists
were increasingly organizing themselves via the Internet and using
it to spread hate material, ''hit lists'' of leftists and other
perceived enemies and even bomb-making instructions.
</P>
<P>
   German neo-Nazis now have more than 330 Web sites, compared to
about 32 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   About a third contain content that could be prosecuted in
Germany as incitement to racial hatred, but the anonymous authors
circumvent the law by posting their sites on Internet service
providers outside Germany, mostly in North America.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whenever someone posts this Nazi propaganda using foreign
providers, our criminal prosecutors become powerless,'' Joachim
Jacob, the government commissioner overseeing privacy laws, said in
a recent radio interview. ''That's the real problem.''
</P>
<P>
   German Jewish leader Paul Spiegel said the efforts are useless
without U.S. involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Washington cuts off interference by pointing to freedom of
opinion,'' he said in this week's Focus newsmagazine. ''That's an
area where the European governments must apply pressure.''

<HEADLINE> US Worried About Detained American  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The health of a Pennsylvania businessman, who
has bone cancer that is in remission, has deteriorated further
since his arrest in Russia on spy charges four months ago, the
State Department said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Richard Boucher said U.S. officials have made clear to
the Russian government their responsibility for the physical
well-being of American citizens detained on their territory,
including the Pennsylvanian, Edmund Pope.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've raised the issue repeatedly with senior Russian
officials (and) raised it yesterday with the Russian Foreign
Ministry,'' Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have also asked permission to visit Mr. Pope as soon as
possible with a physician, in order to perform an independent
examination of his health. But to date, the Russian officials have
denied this request,'' Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. consular officials have visited Pope eight times since his
arrest. His wife, Sheryl, saw him last month in Moscow's Lefortovo
Prison and said he has lost considerable weight.
</P>
<P>
   He runs CERF Technologies International, a consulting firm in
State College, Pa., that developed commercial contacts with Russian
organizations. Pope was arrested in April and charged with stealing
military secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has not commented on the spy charges,
consistent with long-standing policy on such cases.
</P>
<P>
   However, Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., an expert on U.S.-Russian
relations, has taken up Pope's case. He contends the arrest was an
attempt by Russian authorities to show that they have clamped down
on spying. He said recently that Pope was gathering information
about a commercially advertised torpedo.

	   MOUNT ARLINGTON, N.J. (AP) - Software developer Telelogic of
Stockholm, Sweden, announced Tuesday that it is acquiring Quality
Systems and Software Inc., based in Mount Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Telelogic will pay $115 million in stock for the privately held
management solutions provider. QSS had sales of $29.5 million last
year and employs 230 people.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which needs to be approved by U.S. regulatory
authorities, would almost double the Swedish company's sales
capacity in the United States. Chief executive Anders Lidbeck said
he hoped to complete the deal by September.
</P>
<P>
   SADDLE BROOK, N.J. (AP) - The Home Depot, the nation's largest
home improvement retailer, will open its third Villager's Hardware
store in New Jersey here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Villager's Hardware stores are about one-third the size of the
warehouse-style Home Depots and carry tools, garden supplies and
paint.
</P>
<P>
   The first store opened in June 1999, filling a vacant Rickel
Home Center in East Brunswick. The other store opened in Garwood
last November, and a fourth store is scheduled to open in Elizabeth
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot, based in Atlanta, has more than 1,000 stores in the
United States, Puerto Rico, Canada and Chile, and 38 in New Jersey.
The retailer employs approximately 226,000 people.

<HEADLINE> US Concerned Over Kashmir Tensions  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States is trying again to ease
tensions between India and Pakistan, two quarreling South Asia
neighbors who have fought three wars in the past 53 years and now
have nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, President Bill Clinton warned that South Asia was
the most perilous region in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Their dispute over the Himalayan territory of Kashmir, where a
secessionist uprising has raged for more than 11 years, grew more
ominous Tuesday when a Kashmiri militant group called off its
cease-fire with India.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department proposed ''direct discussion'' between
India and Pakistan, but left it to the two sides to figure out how
to get together.
</P>
<P>
   India has refused to negotiate with Pakistan over Kashmir. In
response, the militant Kashmiri group Hezb-ul Mujahedeen called off
its cease-fire, rekindling concerns in Washington over events in
the region.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have had, as you know, continuing concerns about tensions
between India and Pakistan, particularly over Kashmir,'' State
Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Tuesday. ''We've also
been concerned about the threat to regional stability in South Asia
that's posed by the introduction of nuclear weapons to the
region.''
</P>
<P>
   Kashmir is one of the most volatile regions in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''We encourage and support whatever steps the two countries will
take to reduce violence and resolve the differences, including
dialogue between them,'' Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   Divided between Pakistan and India after British rule of the
subcontinent ended in 1947, Kashmir has been the flashpoint for two
of the three wars between the uneasy neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Both countries claim Kashmir in its entirety.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan has been pressing for a vote by Kashmiris on both the
Indian and Pakistani sides of the territory to decide whether a
united Kashmir would join Islamic Pakistan or Hindu India.
</P>
<P>
   A 1948 United Nations resolution calls for the vote, which India
opposes.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said the U.S. government regretted the decision by the
Hezb-ul Mujahedeen to call off its cease-fire with India, and said
''we would urge all sides to nurture and continue the process of
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing India and Pakistan, Boucher said ''it's reasonable
for the parties to sit down together to work on peace and to work
out the structure of the talks.''

<HEADLINE> Jennifer Aniston Sues Magazine  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ''Friends'' actress Jennifer Aniston is no
friend of Celebrity Skin magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Aniston sued the magazine's publishers Monday for printing
photographs of her sunbathing topless in her back yard. The lawsuit
claims the magazine violated Aniston's right to privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Aniston, 31, and ''Friends'' co-stars Courteney Cox and Lisa
Kudrow were featured on the magazine cover. The headline read
''First Time Photos -- Friends Stars X-Posed.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit against Man's World Publications and Crescent
Publishing Group claims that a ''stalkerazzi'' snapped the photos
of her after climbing a neighbor's fence.
</P>
<P>
   Aniston, who married actor Brad Pitt on July 29, seeks
unspecified damages and wants a judge to order the publisher to
stop distributing the pictures.

<HEADLINE> Polling firm drops lawsuit against AOL over 'spamming' blacklist  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - Harris Interactive Inc. has withdrawn a
federal lawsuit accusing America Online Inc. of blocking
correspondence with many of the Internet-based polling company's
6.6 million online panelists.
</P>
<P>
   The publisher of the Harris poll said Tuesday that AOL had
restored e-mail links to Harris panelists by switching to another
Internet service provider not affiliated with Mail Abuse Prevention
System.
</P>
<P>
   ''Self-appointed groups such as MAPS cannot continue to dictate
the standards that affect hundreds of millions of people and
billions of dollars of commerce,'' said Harris Interactive's chief
executive, Gordon S. Black.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit California company, which was established to fight
e-mail abuse, added Harris Interactive to a blacklist for
purportedly sending unsolicited bulk e-mail or ''spam'' - an
accusation the market research company denies.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit filed here on July 31, Harris Interactive said the
listing had prompted 13 Internet service providers to block
correspondence with 2.7 million panelists served by those
providers. MAPS, based in Redwood City, Calif., also was named as a
defendant, along with a market research competitor, Incon Research
of Norwalk, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Harris Interactive said it is still seeking unspecified damages
from a dozen Internet service providers, including Microsoft
Network, Netscape Communications and AltaVista Co. The lawsuit
accuses them of antitrust violations, commercial disparagement and
curtailing Harris Interactive's ability to conduct business.

<HEADLINE> Engelberg: DiMaggio's last words were of Marilyn  </HEADLINE>
By MARV SCHNEIDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Joe DiMaggio died with Marilyn Monroe's name on
his lips, according to the Hall of Famer's lawyer and confidant.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll finally get to see Marilyn,'' DiMaggio whispered.
</P>
<P>
   Morris Engelberg, who was at the Yankee outfielder's bedside
when he died, recalled DiMaggio's last words in a story in Vanity
Fair magazine.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the first time DiMaggio had said that, Engelberg said
Tuesday from his office in Hollywood, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were sitting together in the patio one night, talking about
his illness, and he said, 'I don't feel bad about dying. At least,
I'll be with Marilyn again.'''
</P>
<P>
   Engelberg scoffed at a Daily News report quoting a hospice
worker who said DiMaggio had no last words when he died of lung
cancer at 84 in March 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course, there were, and that's what Joe told me,''
Engelberg said.
</P>
<P>
   He said DiMaggio never stopped loving Monroe even after their
nine-month marriage in 1954 ended in divorce. In Engelberg's view,
the actress may have been the only person DiMaggio really loved.
</P>
<P>
   The list of people DiMaggio hated, according to the Vanity Fair
story, included Frank Sinatra, Presidents Kennedy and Clinton and
Robert Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   The article, featured in the September issue of Vanity Fair, was
based on a series of interviews with Engelberg.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio is pictured as a brooding, parsimonious loner who held
grudges and demanded strict adherence to rules.
</P>
<P>
   ''Never mention Monroe, Sinatra or the Kennedys,'' was one of
the rules.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio blamed Monroe's drug and alcohol addiction, and her
death from an apparent overdose, on Sinatra and the Kennedy
brothers, Engelberg said.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio believed Sinatra introduced Monroe to the Kennedys in
return for possible political favors, and he despised John and
Robert Kennedy to the point that he saw something deserved in their
assassinations, according to the article.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was another president on DiMaggio's enemies list,
Engelberg said. The baseball great detested the president for
everything from Whitewater to his affair with Monica Lewinsky, the
magazine reported.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio declined to shake Clinton's hand when the two were at
Camden Yards in Baltimore in 1995 to see Cal Ripken break Lou
Gehrig's streak of consecutive games. And when Clinton called the
hospital during DiMaggio's fatal illness, the call was not put
through.
</P>
<P>
   Engelberg said one reason he granted the interview to Vanity
Fair was to dispel stories that he made money from the deals he
arranged for DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   ''I opened my books to show that. I could have made millions,
but I couldn't charge him,'' Engelberg said. ''I wanted to be his
friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason, Engelberg said, was to perpetuate DiMaggio's
name among a new generation of fans.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want Joe to become another Lou Gehrig. None of today's
kids knows who Lou Gehrig was,'' Engelberg said. ''I want Joe
DiMaggio to become another Babe Ruth when it comes to
recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   Engelberg said for the same reason he hopes to write a book
about DiMaggio. He said he has taped material for about 350 pages.
</P>
<P>
   ''Believe me, it's not to make money,'' Engelberg said. ''I will
donate about 25 percent to a charity, and taxes will grab more than
40 percent. I want the book so my grandchildren can read it and
love Joe DiMaggio the way I do.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio's net worth grew to about $15 million from the $200,000
to $300,000 it had been 16 years earlier when Engelberg took over
his business affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, DiMaggio never could overcome the memory of growing up poor
in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   He stocked his refrigerator with doggie bags from restaurants,
Engelberg told the magazine. The story also recounts that DiMaggio
loved getting things free, whether it was an apartment with
hundreds of thousands of dollars in furnishings or packs of cookies
he crammed into his pockets when in an airline lounge.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio was reluctant to turn on the air conditioning or take
the Mercedes given him by the Yankees to a car wash. He did his own
vacuuming and laundry, and he liked getting beat when someone else
reached for the check.

<HEADLINE> Bandits Rob Italian Freight Train  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Thieves used a homemade stop light Tuesday to rob an
Italian freight train loaded with cigarettes craved by black
marketeers.
</P>
<P>
   The holdup was the third robbery of a freight train carrying
cigarettes in southern Italy in less than four months, Italian news
reports said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said a band of about a dozen bandits planted a homemade
red light on the tracks in the countryside in the Puglia region in
southeastern Italy, making the Sicily-bound train to halt.
</P>
<P>
   The gang made off with about two tons of cigarettes legally
manufactured by Italy's state tobacco monopoly and loaded them onto
a truck. Police, alerted about the holdup, began searching for the
bandits and found the truck abandoned along with its cargo not far
away, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Many Italian smokers feed their nicotine habit with contraband
cigarettes bought on the street from black-market vendors, avoiding
steep taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But crackdowns on smugglers bringing in bootleg smokes in
speedboats across the Adriatic Sea from former Yugoslavia have left
the black marketeers short of merchandise, authorities say.
</P>
<P>
   The scope of contraband cigarette trafficking was underlined
last month when the head of a state criminal court in neighboring
Switzerland was arrested on corruption charges. Italian anti-Mafia
investigators had photographed the official with an alleged top
international cigarette smuggler.

<HEADLINE> During private law career, Lieberman courted politics  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a civil lawyer in the 1970s and early 1980s, Connecticut Sen.
Joseph Lieberman spent more time courting his political interests
than developing legal ones. And that was fine with his colleagues,
who knew from the start that Lieberman's calling was public
service, not private practice.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Yale Law School in 1967, Lieberman joined
Wiggin &AMP; Dana, a New Haven law firm that assigned him mostly to
run-of-the-mill civil cases.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were two impressions everyone had of Joe,'' said Noel
Hanf, managing partner of Wiggin &AMP; Dana, who was hired at the firm
at about the time Lieberman left. ''One was that he was very bright
and focused. The other was that his horizons were always broader
than private practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman left Wiggin &AMP; Dana in 1969 to write ''The Power
Broker,'' a profile of Democratic National Chairman John M. Bailey.
A year later he won his first state Senate seat, and in 1972
started his own firm with Ted Baldwin - now New Haven's corporation
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ''Joe was more of a counselor than a litigator,'' Baldwin said.
''He gave people advice, and that's what the clients appreciated
from him.''
</P>
<P>
   The cases that Lieberman took on were unremarkable - mostly real
estate closings and limited corporation work.
</P>
<P>
   ''He treated the Senate position as a full-time job,'' said Jim
Segaloff, who added his name to the Baldwin &AMP; Lieberman firm as a
full partner in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was interested in practicing law, and it was understood that
Joe would pursue his political thing,'' Segaloff said. ''That was
fine with everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin left the firm by 1979, but Lieberman and Segaloff spent
the next 12 years as partners.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think his focus at that time was on being an attorney
so much as being a state senator,'' said state Attorney General
Richard Blumenthal. ''He made a living as a lawyer, but he was
always looking beyond that.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, Lieberman began his six-year stint as Connecticut's
attorney general. Still a part-time job at the time, Lieberman kept
his stake in the New Haven law firm until 1985, when he turned his
full attention to politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think that Joe would necessarily have made a better
politician than lawyer,'' Baldwin said. ''He had a calling to
public service, and he followed it. If his calling was to the law,
he would have been as successful in that field as he has been in
politics.''

<HEADLINE> Man killed by slow-moving freight train  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORT CRANE, N.Y. (AP) - A slow-moving freight train struck and
killed a man late Monday night, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The accident that killed 22-year-old David Mulcahy of Port Crane
occurred at around 11:40 p.m. on tracks just north of Binghamton,
according to Broome County Sheriff David Harder.
</P>
<P>
   Train operators told investigators the train was traveling at
around 34 miles per hour when they spotted Mulcahy on the tracks.
The operators were unable to stop the train in time to avoid
striking Mulcahy, whose legs were severed on impact, Harder said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The engineer saw something and blew the horn,'' Harder said.
''The victim's legs were across the tracks. He raised his head up,
looked at him, and just laid there. You can't stop a train on a
dime. Eighteen cars went by before it came to a stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Harder said the accident was not yet classified as a suicide,
but he said that hasn't been ruled out.

<HEADLINE> Chavez Asks Cabinet To Resign  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- President Hugo Chavez has asked his
entire cabinet to resign as part of plan to reorganize the
government and revive the flagging economy following his landslide
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Isaias Rodriguez announced the move Tuesday,
saying some cabinet ministers would be reinstated following the
resignations, and others would leave their posts for good.
</P>
<P>
   ''The idea is to keep functionaries who should be kept and
replace others in order to carry out the policy of rescuing the
country from the economic crisis,'' Rodriguez told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez won a new six-year term in general elections on July 30,
and though his popularity is strong it has been eroded by a
punishing recession that saw the economy shrink by seven percent
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, who is currently on a trip to the Middle East visiting
fellow members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, has vowed to make the economy his top priority going
into his new term.
</P>
<P>
   His economic team has often been accused of being incompetent,
but Chavez has repeatedly refused requests that they be sacked. It
wasn't immediately clear what the latest cabinet reshuffle would
mean for key economic posts.
</P>
<P>
   The economic woes came despite a boom in the price of petroleum,
Venezuela's main export. Oil prices have quadrupled since Chavez
took office in February 1999. Chavez's critics say his scathing
verbal attacks on business leaders have created a hostile climate
for investment.
</P>
<P>
   The economy is slowly recovering, however, with the government
reporting gross domestic product growing by 0.3 percent in the
year's first quarter and by about 2 percent in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, a former paratrooper who staged a failed military coup
in 1992, is turning to the economy after overhauling Venezuela's
political structure with a new constitution, which required the
July elections to fill public offices on all levels.

<HEADLINE> Attorney generals for 28 states allege record companies cheated consumers </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Record companies should pay back millions of
dollars in illegal profits they collected by forcing discount
stores to raise CD prices in 1995, attorney generals for 28 states
alleged in a lawsuit Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''These illegal actions certainly have not been music to the
ears of the public,'' New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer said
at a news conference as the lawsuit was filed in U.S. District
Court in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The music companies maintain that they threatened to stop
supplying discount chains with thousands of dollars in advertising
dollars in the mid 1990s because the chains were selling CDs at
below wholesale cost, driving some record stores out of business.
They indicated in statements Tuesday that they would contest the
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit comes three months after the five major music
distributors, while admitting no wrongdoing, settled Federal Trade
Commission charges they unfairly inflated CD prices.
</P>
<P>
   Under that deal, the companies agreed to discontinue minimum
advertised price programs that forced retailers to sell music CDs
at or above a set level in return for getting substantial
advertising funding.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said the lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages, was
meant to force record companies to pay back the profits they made
illegally.
</P>
<P>
   He said he could not yet estimate the value of those profits but
said the $480 million estimated by the FTC sounded reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit by the states essentially does what the FTC promised
not to do in its settlement deal: seek damages for past prices.
</P>
<P>
   But the attorney generals said they were seeking damages on
behalf of the consumers they represent.
</P>
<P>
   They said the record companies in February 1995 conspired to
force several large discount retailers to raise prices after the
retailers bought CDs in such large volume that they could undercut
the prevailing high retail prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''The purpose of the illegal agreements was to raise prices and
reduce retail price competition which threatened the high and
stable profit margins for CDs enjoyed by both the defendant labels
and distributors and many music retailers,'' the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   The deals initially drew vigorous protests from discount
retailers but the chains eventually gave up because the financial
penalty for not participating in the scheme was too costly, the
lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, CD prices stabilized and then rose, the lawsuit
said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the record companies, the lawsuit named some large
record stores as defendants, including Tower Records.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Solomon, chairman of the Sacramento, Calif.-based Tower,
did not immediately return a telephone message. But he scoffed at
the FTC's prediction earlier this year that the settlement would
result in lower CD prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''Prices are not coming down,'' he told the Los Angeles Times.
''They're already at rock bottom. It's outrageous to mislead music
fans to think otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   Keith Estabrook, a spokesman for defendant BMG Music, said the
company still believed that the pricing policy ''was a legitimate
and appropriate practice and we are confident that the courts will
reach the same conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Bridges, an EMI Music spokeswoman, said the claims were
without merit.
</P>
<P>
   Will Tanous, a Warner Music spokesman, said the pricing policies
served ''a valid business purpose and benefited consumers by
substantially furthering retail competition.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It was an appropriate and lawful practice,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Sony Music spokesman Keith McCarthy said he had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   Universal Music did not immediately return a telephone message
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   According to the FTC, the five companies distribute 85 percent
of the music CDs sold in the United States, an industry that
reported a record $15 billion in sales last year. The average CD
now costs $14 to $17, though discount stores had once sold some
popular CDs for as little as $10.
</P>
<P>
   While music companies were guarded on the record Tuesday,
privately they defended their pricing practices as a way to
discourage discount retailers from selling records below wholesale
price and allegedly driving tiny record stores into bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Curry, a spokesman for the Recording Industry Association
of America, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The following states were named as plaintiffs in the lawsuit:
Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii,
Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi,
Missouri, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Northern
Mariana Islands, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island,
South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia and
Wisconsin.

<HEADLINE> Police looking for suspect in fatal puppy throwing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWBURGH, N.Y. (AP) - Police are looking for a person who killed
a puppy by hurling it out a third-story window last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before midnight Saturday, two young women ran into the
emergency room at St. Luke's Hospital. One of them carried a tiny
puppy. The puppy was whimpering and ''screaming'' in shock and
pain, said emergency-room nurse Linda Parisi-Titmas.
</P>
<P>
   The women told city police Officer John Jenerose that a girl had
rushed up to them on Miller Street and handed them the puppy,
saying someone threw it out a third-floor window.
</P>
<P>
   Nurses wrapped the dog in a blanket to warm it, tried to comfort
it with some infant formula, and administered oxygen. They called
Flannery's Animal Hospital in New Windsor.
</P>
<P>
   A local emergency medical technician offered to transport the
dog in the ambulance to the animal hospital, where the dog died.

<P>
   Spitzer said the lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages, was
meant to force record companies to pay back the profits they made
illegally.
</P>
<P>
   He said he could not yet estimate the value of those profits but
said the $480 million estimated by the FTC sounded reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit by the states essentially does what the FTC promised
not to do in its settlement deal: seek damages for past prices.
</P>
<P>
   But the attorneys general said they were seeking damages on
behalf of the consumers they represent.
</P>
<P>
   They said the record companies in February 1995 conspired to
force several large discount retailers to raise prices after the
retailers bought CDs in such large volume that they could undercut
the prevailing high retail prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''The purpose of the illegal agreements was to raise prices and
reduce retail price competition which threatened the high and
stable profit margins for CDs enjoyed by both the defendant labels
and distributors and many music retailers,'' the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   The deals initially drew vigorous protests from discount
retailers but the chains eventually gave up because the financial
penalty for not participating in the scheme was too costly, the
lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, CD prices stabilized and then rose, the lawsuit
said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the record companies, the lawsuit named some large
record stores as defendants, including Tower Records.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Solomon, chairman of the Sacramento, Calif.-based Tower,
did not immediately return a telephone message. But he scoffed at
the FTC's prediction earlier this year that the settlement would
result in lower CD prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''Prices are not coming down,'' he told the Los Angeles Times.
''They're already at rock bottom. It's outrageous to mislead music
fans to think otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   Keith Estabrook, a spokesman for defendant BMG Music, said the
company still believed that the pricing policy ''was a legitimate
and appropriate practice and we are confident that the courts will
reach the same conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Bridges, an EMI Music spokeswoman, said the claims were
without merit.
</P>
<P>
   Will Tanous, a Warner Music spokesman, said the pricing policies
served ''a valid business purpose and benefited consumers by
substantially furthering retail competition.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It was an appropriate and lawful practice,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Sony Music spokesman Keith McCarthy said he had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   Universal Music did not immediately return a telephone message
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   According to the FTC, the five companies distribute 85 percent
of the music CDs sold in the United States, an industry that
reported a record $15 billion in sales last year. The average CD
now costs $14 to $17, though discount stores had once sold some
popular CDs for as little as $10.
</P>
<P>
   While music companies were guarded on the record Tuesday,
privately they defended their pricing practices as a way to
discourage discount retailers from selling records below wholesale
price and allegedly driving tiny record stores into bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Curry, a spokesman for the Recording Industry Association
of America, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The following states were named as plaintiffs in the lawsuit:
Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii,
Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi,
Missouri, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Northern
Mariana Islands, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island,
South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia and
Wisconsin.

<HEADLINE> New York party founder wants out of national Reform Party  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A co-founder of the New York arm of the
Reform Party said Tuesday she wants to end the state's Independence
Party ties to the national party.
</P>
<P>
   Laureen Oliver, who was instrumental in the founding of the
Independence Party in 1991 and is a former state party chairwoman,
said it's ''very likely'' that the party will not endorse either
candidate seeking the national Reform Party's presidential
nomination at its state convention in September.
</P>
<P>
   Such a move could put Oliver at odds with another leader of the
state party, Lenora Fulani. The two have been allies in recent
months.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver, who is the Independence Party's secretary, said such a
move would essentially mean the New York party was disaffiliating
from the Reform Party. That is something the Minnesota arm of the
party, with the encouragement of Gov. Jesse Ventura, has already
done.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver's announcement came as Reform Party delegates were
gathering in Long Beach, Calif. for their national convention.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, members of the Monroe County faction of the
Independence Party - the largest in the state - voted against
supporting either Pat Buchanan or his lesser-known challenger John
Hagelin at the party's state convention.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver said the decision by Monroe County members has
''broad-based'' support in New York and predicted that position
would prevail at the September gathering.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's an extremely high chance that there won't be a Reform
Party candidate in New York,'' Oliver said. ''We're not obligated
legally to endorse their candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just shortened the list. When the state convention opens in
September, it will be open to all presidential candidates -
Democrats, Republicans, Ralph Nader,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Buchanan nor Hagelin are in line with the Independence
Party's ''centrist values,'' Oliver said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the national Reform Party's platform and organization
has drifted away from the New York affiliate's expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's in effect a de facto vote to disaffiliate New York from
the Reform Party,'' she said of the possible outcome at the
September state convention.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver said she is so upset with the direction of the national
party that she has refused to attend the national convention.
</P>
<P>
   A major battle has erupted at the national convention between
Buchanan supporters and those of Hagelin, including some loyal to
party founder Ross Perot. Buchanan is battling an effort to have
him disqualified as a candidate for the party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   New York's Independence Party also has its share of troubles. A
faction of the party headed by Fulani, a former leader of the
left-leaning New Alliance Party, first supported Buchanan then
switched to Hagelin.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Lyons, a spokeswoman for the party's Democracy Coalition,
said both Fulani and party Chairman Frank MacKay are attending the
national convention. Lyons said about two dozen of the state
party's 31 delegates have gone to California.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver ''is just sending out a signal about which way Monroe
County is going to go'' at the New York convention, Lyons said.
''Hagelin is the strong favorite in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver said Fulani's faction is a ''very minor portion'' of the
state party organization.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's entitled to support what she pleases, but it doesn't
look the Independence Party is going to support her choice,''
Oliver said.

<HEADLINE> Lucent seeking chief operating officer to lead realigned company  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MURRAY HILL, N.J. (AP) - Lucent Technologies is seeking a chief
operating officer as part of its reorganization to focus its
business on building the infrastructure for broadband and mobile
Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   The post has been vacant since October, when the two men who
held it jointly took other positions in the company.
</P>
<P>
   The company also announced Tuesday that Patricia Russo,
executive vice president and CEO of the service provider networks
group, has decided to leave the company.
</P>
<P>
   The moves are the latest in a series of recent restructuring
moves by the Murray Hill-based telecommunications giant, which
expects to shed two businesses and 50,000 employees by spring 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are redefining Lucent to be the leader in building a
broadband and mobile Internet that will change the way people
communicate,'' chairman and chief executive officer Richard McGinn
said.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Lucent said it would spin off the enterprise networks
business, which sells voice and computer communication systems to
businesses. That division, and its 34,000 employees, are to be
separated by Sept. 30, spokesman Bill Price said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Lucent said it would spin off its $4 billion-a-year
microelectronics business, which has 16,000 employees. That
business makes silicon chips and optoelectronic components such as
lasers used to build the telephone, wireless and Internet
communications systems Lucent sells.
</P>
<P>
   The spinoffs will leave Lucent with about 100,000 employees,
Price said.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent said last week it would split its optical networking
group into separate units focusing on long-distance and
metropolitan fiber optic networks. The networks carry digitized
voice, Internet and data traffic at high speeds on multiple
wavelengths, or channels, of light.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent's stock price, which was $84 in December, plunged to
$54.125 three weeks ago when company executives warned profits for
the next two quarters will be well below analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, shares were down $2, or 5 percent, to close at
$40.25 on the New York Stock Exchange

<HEADLINE> Eagleton poll puts finger in wind, comes up with taxes, economy  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - It is still the economy stupid, and taxes,
too, that residents want to hear about most from their U.S. Senate
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   This is according to a poll done by the Eagleton Institute at
Rutgers University and analyzed by Eagleton professors who will be
monitoring the election campaign between Democrat Jon Corzine and
Republican U.S. Rep. Bob Franks.
</P>
<P>
   When 618 residents were asked to name the top problem a new
senator should address, 21 percent said taxes and 9 percent said
economic issues, according to the poll taken in early June. The
poll had a margin of error of 4.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Eagleton professor Ingrid Reed said the poll is being released
now because it took time to analyze the results and because voter
interest has been piqued by the GOP convention in Philadelphia and
the Democratic convention beginning Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The country's future cannot be addressed in generalities,''
Reed said. ''The candidate needs to know what people want answers
about.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll took two approaches.
</P>
<P>
   First, it asked voters to name their top concern without
providing a list of issues from which to choose. Reed said Eagleton
staff classified the spontaneous responses into issue groups.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, 6 percent wanted tax cuts, 6 percent wanted the
Social Security tax addressed, 5 percent identified property taxes
as their top concern, 1 percent mentioned other specific taxes and
3 percent said they were concerned about taxes in general. These
were merged to give taxes a response of 21 percent, the highest on
the poll.
</P>
<P>
   Another 9 percent mentioned as their top concern various points
about the economy, from jobs to inflation to the budget surplus to
high gasoline prices.
</P>
<P>
   Only 1 percent mentioned campaign finance - a key point of
Franks' attacks on Corzine for his excessive spending in the
primary campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am really perplexed because of the apparent interest of the
voters in John McCain, where people would respond that they were
interested in him because of his position on campaign finance
reform. One guess would be that people don't see it affecting them
personally,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   The second poll question listed nine issues and asked
respondents to identify whether they were ''very interested'' in
these subjects, allowing them to select more than one or
potentially all nine. In this round, 80 percent said they were very
interested in health issues, 78 percent in education and 72 percent
in Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine spokesman Tom Shea said the second poll question lines
up closely with Corzine's campaign message. As for economic
concerns, Shea said, ''I think that Jon feels very strongly that we
have to take advantage of this economic boom to invest in the
health care and education systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Franks campaign manager Charlie Smith said the poll shows that
Franks has been hitting the right economic points. ''Bob Franks has
said throughout this campaign season that he served four terms in
Congress committed to balancing the budget and cutting taxes,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> AmerGen buys Oyster Creek nuclear plant  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FORKED RIVER, N.J. (AP) - AmerGen, a joint venture between PECO
Energy Co. and the largest energy generator in the United Kingdom,
bought the Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station on Tuesday for
$10 million.
</P>
<P>
   With the sale, Morristown-based GPU Inc., ceased generating
energy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are now sharply focused on the transmission and
distribution of electricity, as well as new, non-regulated
businesses,'' said Fred D. Hafer, GPU chairman, president and CEO.
</P>
<P>
   Oyster Creek's 636 employees became AmerGen employees with the
sale, said Bill Jones, AmerGen spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be reviews of staff levels down the road, but no
immediate reduction in force,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   The sale includes the 619-megawatt reactor and adjacent
property.
</P>
<P>
   AmerGen Energy Co., a joint venture of Philadelphia-based PECO
Energy Co. and British Energy Co. of Scotland, now holds the
license for Oyster's Creek's operation.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the license
transfer in June and the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities
approved the sale on July 20.
</P>
<P>
   GPU Inc. had planned to close the plant this year if it didn't
find a buyer.
</P>
<P>
   AmerGen will assume responsibility for the ultimate
decommissioning of Oyster Creek. Its current license expires in
2009, Jones said, but AmerGen could apply for a license extension.
</P>
<P>
   GPU on Tuesday turned over $440 million to AmerGen as its share
of the decommissioning costs, said Ned Raynolds, GPU spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   AmerGen last year bought Three Mile Island Unit 1 in Middletown,
Pa., and the Clinton Power Station in Clinton, Ill. The company has
signed a purchase agreement for the Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power
Station in Vermont.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton: I want Lieberman to campaign with me  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - U.S. Senate candidate Hillary Rodham
Clinton, trying to court New York's crucial Jewish electorate, said
Tuesday she has already talked to Democratic vice presidential pick
Joseph Lieberman about campaigning with her.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's Republican rival, U.S. Rep. Rick Lazio, said ''if
the Clinton camp is counting on Joe Lieberman to push them over the
finish line, they are making a big mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio spokesman Dan McLagan said, ''Mrs. Clinton is trying to
hitch her rickety campaign wagon to Senator Lieberman's fine
reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton borrowed a line that failed presidential candidate
Walter Mondale had used against his 1984 Democratic rival, Gary
Hart, to deride this year's Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''After the Republican Convention of last week, a lot of people
were saying, 'Well, gee, where's the beef?' It's a pretty show and
everybody you know put on a good front, but what are their real
positions,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady said that with Al Gore at the top of the ticket
and Lieberman as his running mate, voters wouldn't be asking such
questions about the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were talking about him coming to campaign for me here in
New York ... I think it's going to be fabulous,'' the first lady
said as she related a telephone discussion she and Lieberman had
Monday after his selection to become Gore's running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here in New York, it's going to drive up the vice president's
numbers which will be great for the ticket,'' Clinton told Albany's
WROW-AM radio.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope he'll be here, but I can't be greedy because he's got a
lot of ground to cover,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the first lady made it clear that she expected
Lieberman to continue to be supportive of her candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has stood up for me against some of the false accusations
that have come my way,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady also said she expected the president to campaign
for her in New York heavily this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Polls have shown Clinton and Lazio running a tight Senate race
and with her falling below the 60 percent level among Jewish voters
that is traditionally thought necessary for a Democrat to win in
New York. Jews generally make up about 12 percent of the vote in
statewide races in New York.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Gore asked Lieberman to become the first Jew to ever
run for vice president on a major party ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady has been fighting a perception that she is overly
sympathetic to the Palestinians and Lieberman has already tried to
aid her credibility on that front. In December, he accompanied the
first lady to a meeting with the Orthodox Union, which represents
Orthodox synagogues. Last month, Lieberman joined other Jewish
legislators in Washington defending her against an allegation that
she used an anti-Semitic obscenity in an argument in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's friendship with the Clintons goes back to 1970, when
President Clinton - then a Yale Law student - campaigned for
Lieberman's state Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   While admitting she had differences with Lieberman on such
things as school vouchers - he favors them, while she does not -
the first lady said Tuesday that she was ''thrilled'' he had been
chosen by Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Lieberman's criticism that her husband had engaged
in ''disgraceful'' conduct during the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal,
Clinton said, ''People will remember that when Joe said that, the
president said he agreed with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio - noting the first lady's differences with Lieberman on
such things as school vouchers - said the first lady was ''miles
apart from'' the Connecticut senator on that and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady continued to duck questions about whether she
would debate her long-shot opponent for the Democratic Senate
nomination, Dr. Mark McMahon of Manhattan. She has called for a
series of debates against Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   While in Albany, the first lady picked up the expected
endorsement of the state's largest union, the New York State United
Teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Tony McCann, who teaches high school English in nearby Clifton
Park, said Lazio was ''a good man. It's nice to see him running,
but this bright lady is just leagues ahead of him. She's
scholarship material. He needs a lot of remedial help.''
</P>
<P>
   On the way to the teachers' union conference at an Albany hotel,
Clinton stopped her motorcade to chat with about 60 striking
Verizon Communications workers picketing outside the company's
office in downtown Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Clinton visited a Hasidic Jewish girl's school
in Rockland County where she was greeted by about 600 students,
their mothers and other relatives. She evoked Lieberman's name
several times.
</P>
<P>
   ''Perhaps you, as Jewish Americans, would take particular
pleasure in seeing Joe Lieberman given this great honor,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton campaigned across New York, Lazio continued a
multi-day fund-raising trip that is taking him across the country
this week. On Tuesday, he was making stops in Denver and in
California.

By WILLIAM CONROY
<TEXT>
<P>
   TINTON FALLS, N.J. (AP) - At precisely 7:16 a.m. on a recent
Wednesday, when many people were just starting to wake up, travel
agency owner Stephen D. Weaver called the weekly meeting of LeTip
of Two Rivers/Red Bank to order in a banquet room at the Holiday
Inn of Tinton Falls.
</P>
<P>
   Members and guests scurried to their seats around tables
arranged in a rectangle and began standing up and telling each
other about their businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hate getting up in the morning before 9 a.m.,'' Lynne Z.
Karinja confessed after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the Tinton Falls-based certified public accountant
has been rising early once almost every week for five years - not
because she craves the breakfast buffet of fruit, bagels, coffee
and juice - but because LeTip is worth it for her business, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   LeTip is not the only business group that brings business people
together on a regular basis. Networking happens on virtually a
daily basis in a variety of other organizations in Monmouth and
Ocean counties, and entrepreneurs say it provides a big boost to
their business.
</P>
<P>
   In the age of the Internet, small business owners have a wealth
of options - including Web sites, e-mail and faxes - to promote
themselves, but they say there still is no substitute for
face-to-face contact.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fortunately, the computer hasn't displaced people
completely,'' said Milton Leontiades, dean of the Rutgers
University School of Business in Camden. ''Face-to-face contact is
still the most effective way to sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat G. Angelastro, a native of Bergen County who bought the
Drifting Sands Oceanfront Hotel in Ship Bottom last February, said
networking through local organizations is a necessity for him.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's one of the things I've been trying to do to get myself
and the name of the company out there to the community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Angelastro, 30, joined the Southern Ocean County Chamber of
Commerce and the Long Beach Island Rotary Club after buying his
hotel. Membership in both organizations has already resulted in
referrals and additional bookings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure there is probably a blend of reasons in everybody's
membership,'' said Jeanne DiPaola, executive director of the
Southern Ocean County Chamber of Commerce, which has about 550
members. ''New businesses are very eager to join the chamber
because it gives their businesses credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   J. Wandres, an Aberdeen-based writer and public relations
consultant, was one of 42 people who paid $25 to display his wares
at a recent ''business showcase'' sponsored by the Monmouth-Ocean
Development Council and the Jersey Shore Public Relations and
Advertising Association.
</P>
<P>
   No one closes a deal at such get-togethers, said Wandres. But
you may make some business contacts, swap business cards and try to
develop a business relationship in the future, he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Wandres said he met a graphic designer, Howard Levy, five years
ago through the public relations and advertising association. The
contact has resulted in several projects for Wandres over the
years, either through referrals or joint efforts with Levy, said
Wandres. He is currently working on three projects with the
graphics designer.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no group has perfected the art of business networking as
well as LeTip International. The organization is the purest, most
stripped-down form of a networking organization that a business
owner or manager can find.
</P>
<P>
   As its name suggests, members of the group meet to swap business
tips or leads. A tip is defined as a company or a person who is
interested in a specific service or product offered by a LeTip
member and who expects a call from that member.
</P>
<P>
   LeTip member Bill Cowley said he and his brother, Drew, closely
track where their business comes from at Cowley's Pest Control in
Neptune City. They each belong to a different LeTip chapter and
said they can trace $13,000 worth of business this year back to
leads they've received from LeTip contacts.
</P>
<P>
   One of the ways that LeTip differs from other business groups is
that the membership is restricted to one of each kind of business,
so members do not compete with each other, said Weaver, president
of LeTip of Two Rivers/Red Bank and owner of Carlson Wagonlit
Travel in Tinton Falls. The group has 31 members.
</P>
<P>
   ''I look at it as an extension of my sales force,'' Weaver said.
''These people are working for me.''

<P>
   The meeting moves along with military-like precision, although
there is a lot of kidding back and forth among the members. Once
each month, a member visits another member's business, and at this
meeting they are reporting on those visits. There is a 30-second
time limit on those reports, and Weaver enforces it with a bell.
</P>
<P>
   Karinja, who co-owns the Tinton Falls-based accounting firm
Liska, Karinja &AMP; Associates LLC, said one of the things she likes
about LeTip is that it's time-efficient networking. As a business
owner and mother of two children, she said she has to be selective
about how she uses her time.
</P>
<P>
   LeTip was founded in 1978 in San Diego. Members receive small
rewards (such as $2 if they pass four or more tips to other
members) or pay small fines ($1 for bringing no tips to a meeting,
for example).
</P>
<P>
   The organization is not to everyone's taste, Karinja said. Over
the past few years, the Two Rivers group has had a core of about 15
members, but the others change, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Membership costs $350 in the first year, plus a $95 payment
quarterly, then $200 a year after that, plus the $95 quarterly
payment.

<HEADLINE> State may let compulsive gamblers ban themselves from casinos  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - Compulsive gamblers who can't resist
the lure of clinking slot machines and spinning roulette wheels may
soon get a new tool to help themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The state of New Jersey, which maintains a list of mobsters,
cheats and others who are banned from entering casinos, is
proposing a ''self-exclusion'' program that would allow problem
gamblers to ban themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Under it, gamblers could register with the state and provide a
photograph of themselves to casinos, which would then be required
to deny them access to games, credit, complimentary items,
check-cashing privileges, players club perks, direct-mail
promotions and other benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative, announced Monday by the state Division of Gaming
Enforcement, mirrors similar efforts in Connecticut, Missouri,
Michigan and Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   It still must be approved by the state Casino Control Commission
to take effect.
</P>
<P>
   One casino gambling critic called the proposal window dressing,
aimed at masking the fact that casinos depend on gambling addicts
for their profits.
</P>
<P>
   ''I won't slam any recognition by casinos that there's a
problem, but if this is the best they can do for a diseased person,
telling them 'It's going to rely on you to treat yourself,' then
the problem will persist,'' said the Rev. Tom Grey, executive
director of the National Coalition Against Gambling Expansion.
''Don't forget, their profitability comes from people who are
pathological gamblers.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 16 million Americans have experienced gambling
problems at some point in their lives, according to the National
Research Council.
</P>
<P>
   The director of the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement,
J.P. Suarez, said anyone on the list discovered in a casino would
be escorted off by security guards, Suarez said.
</P>
<P>
   They would not face criminal sanctions, however, and the ban
would not be permanent. A person could have his name removed from
the list by formally requesting it and waiting 30 days, Suarez
said.
</P>
<P>
   Casinos, meanwhile, could face cash penalties for violating the
ban, Suarez said.
</P>
<P>
   The Division of Gaming Enforcement is in discussions with the
state attorney general's office about the possibility of forcing
casinos and excluded gamblers to forfeit money won or lost by a
person while on the self exclusion list, Suarez said.
</P>
<P>
   No regulation has been proposed for that yet, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Looney, executive director of the Council on Compulsive
Gambling of New Jersey, applauded the self-exclusion proposal
Tuesday. He said many recovering gamblers reported relapses after
receiving promotional literature or invitations from casinos in the
mail.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are not going to be thousands and thousands of people
signing up for this. These programs have been in place elsewhere
and the numbers haven't been large. But the ones who are serious
about getting rid of the temptations, they will go along with it,''
Looney said.
</P>
<P>
   Grey, an anti-casino crusader who travels the country organizing
opposition to ballot referendums on casino gambling, said the
proposal is ''a day late and a dollar short.''
</P>
<P>
   ''How long have you had casinos there? Twenty years? Now, 20
years down the road, they've discovered self-exclusion? When they
start moving the ATMs and credit offices off the casino floors,
I'll take them seriously,'' Grey said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Goodman, executive director of the nonprofit U.S.
Gambling Research Institute in Northampton, Mass., called the
program a step in the right direction but questioned whether it
would have much impact on problem gamblers, who by their nature do
not believe they have a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''They need a program like this for legislators, who seem to
compulsively turn to gambling every time they have a fiscal
problem,'' said Goodman, author of ''The Luck Business,'' a book
about gambling. ''If they could get legislators to sign onto it,
saying they won't turn to casinos when they have a fiscal problem,
that would be even better.''

<HEADLINE> Jogger in critical condition after being struck by lightning  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLTS NECK, N.J. (AP) - A Monmouth County jogger was in critical
but stable condition Tuesday, a day after being struck by lightning
during a severe thunderstorm that felled trees, downed power lines
and crushed several cars.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Damas, 57, of Middletown, saw the black clouds and began to
jog back home when he was struck by lightning, police said. A
neighbor found him unconscious and bleeding on the side of a road
about 6:30 p.m., then called police. He was taken to Riverview
Medical Center in Red Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ''His clothes were torn and singed and he had a mark on his
neck,'' Police Sgt. William Best told The Star-Ledger of Newark for
Tuesday's edition.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had a Walkman radio ... it was broken open and the circuit
board was melted.''
</P>
<P>
   Reports of funnel clouds prompted the National Weather Service
Tuesday to investigate whether a tornado touched down in Colts
Neck. Meteorologist Jim Poirier said preliminary reports indicate
the storm damage was caused by straight line winds, rather than a
tornado.
</P>
<P>
   Straight line winds, during a severe storm, spread out
horizontally and form a straight line along the ground. He
estimated that winds reached at least 60 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   The thunderstorm also snapped six telephone poles in Hopewell
Township, Mercer County, along Route 518, said Police Chief Michael
Chipowski.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Morano, a spokesman for GPU Energy, said 1,700 customers in
central New Jersey lost power about 6 p.m. Monday. At least 800 of
those customers were in Colts Neck, Freehold and Jamesburg. Power
was restored to all customers by 9 a.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Monmouth County Emergency Management Coordinator Harry Conover
told the Asbury Park Press that he believed the area was hit by a
tornado.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're just incredibly lucky that no one was hurt and there was
no substantial property damage,'' Conover said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Maddox, of Marlboro, told the newspaper that he witnessed
a still summer sky produce intense and multidirectional winds in a
matter of seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were two small funnels going from west to east right
over my house,'' he said, adding that 90-foot trees were uprooted
and one of them flattened his son's car. ''I'll have firewood for
the next 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There may have been a funnel cloud, which is a rotating column
of air not in contact with the ground,'' Poirier said, ''but the
damage in Colts Neck was done by the straight line winds.''
Tornados are funnel clouds that actually touch ground.
</P>
<P>
   The storm developed in Bucks County, Pa., and passed through
northern Mercer, southern Somerset, southern Middlesex and Monmouth
counties between 5 and 6:30 p.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon spokeswoman Soraya Rodriguez said between 75 and 100
customers remained without phone service Tuesday night after
Monday's storm downed a phone line on School Road East in Colts
Neck.
</P>
<P>
   She said workers were scheduled to restore the line by early
Wednesday evening.

<HEADLINE> NBC Reaches Historic Ratings Low  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Beleaguered NBC hit a historic low in the
ratings last week, dragged down by a virtually ignored repeat of
''The 10th Kingdom'' miniseries and coverage of the Republican
national convention.
</P>
<P>
   The network had an average prime-time audience of only 6.2
million people. Its 4.4 rating beat NBC's previous low for a week,
set last summer, by more than a full ratings point or more than 1
million households.
</P>
<P>
   NBC executives felt they had little choice but to rerun ''The
10th Kingdom'' to justify the expense of making it. The two-part
conclusion on Sunday drew barely more than 4 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   The network's convention coverage also drew 16 percent fewer
viewers than it did four years ago, the largest drop among the big
three networks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Low ratings are not unexpected during political convention
weeks,'' NBC spokesman Mike Nelson said. ''We also didn't have high
expectations for the repeat of a miniseries.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also a record low rating within the 18-to-49-year-old
demographic that NBC watches most closely. ABC, CBS and Fox all did
better among that age group.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's top entertainment executives have already been under some
fire from their bosses for failing to develop a new hit like CBS'
''Survivor'' or ABC's ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Survivor'' continued rolling for CBS, with another record-high
viewership of 27.4 million, and ''Big Brother'' drew its biggest
audience on Wednesday -- 17.4 million -- since its premiere. But
three episodes of ''Millionaire'' enabled ABC to win the week.
</P>
<P>
   Despite good reviews, Fox's new reality show, ''American High,''
was the network's lowest-rated series of the week.
</P>
<P>
   ABC had a prime-time average of 9.2 million people (6.4 rating,
12 share), CBS had 8.6 million viewers (6.0, 11) and Fox had 5.9
million viewers (3.9, 7). UPN had 3.4 million viewers (2.2, 4), the
WB had 2.6 million (1.8, 3) and Pax TV had 1.3 million (1.0, 2).
</P>
<P>
   NBC's ''Nightly News'' won the evening news ratings race during
convention week with 9 million viewers (6.9 rating, 15 share).
ABC's ''World News Tonight'' had 7.8 million viewers (6.1, 14) and
the ''CBS Evening News had 7.1 million (5.6, 13).
</P>
<P>
   A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of
the nation's estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show.
</P>
<P>
   For the week of July 31-Aug. 6, the top 10 shows, their networks
and ratings:
</P>
<P>
   ''Survivor,'' CBS, 16.7; ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''
(Sunday), ABC, 15.4; ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Tuesday),
ABC, 14.3; ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Thursday), ABC, 12.4;
''Big Brother'' (Wednesday), CBS, 11.1; ''60 Minutes,'' CBS, 9.9;
''Everybody Loves Raymond,'' CBS, 9.0; ''The Practice,'' ABC, 8.4;
''Becker,'' CBS, 8.3; NFL Exhibition Football: San Francisco vs.
New England, ABC, 7.3; ''Law and Order'' (Monday), NBC, 7.3.

<HEADLINE> Historic home to join women's rights national park  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) - President Clinton signed legislation on
Tuesday allowing the house where the first women's rights
convention was planned to become part of the Women's Rights
National Historical Park.
</P>
<P>
   The move allows the National Park Service to acquire Hunt House
in Waterloo, N.Y. - opening it up for public tours and special
events along with the rest of the park.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat, and Rep. Thomas
Reynolds, a Republican, sponsored the bill. Reynolds' western New
York district contains Hunt House.
</P>
<P>
   It was at a tea hosted by Richard and Jane Hunt in July 1848
that Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott and other early women's
rights activists hatched the idea of holding a women's rights
convention. Following the meeting, the women drafted the
groundbreaking Declaration of Sentiments. That manifesto was
presented at the Women's Rights Convention in Seneca Falls, N.Y.
later that month.
</P>
<P>
   The house was privately owned until 1999 when the National Trust
for Historic Preservation purchased it. They have been leasing it
to the Park Service at no cost.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Hunt House is a place of enormous historic significance
and deserves to be in the National Park System,'' National Trust
President Richard Moe said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The trust plans to provide any sale proceeds to the restoration
effort for the home.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 110; Nasdaq Falls 14  </HEADLINE>
By PHIL GALEWITZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue chip stocks rose Tuesday amid growing
optimism that interest rates will remain stable, but technology
issues declined slightly on profit-taking after Monday's big
advance.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, which gained 99 points Monday,
closed up 109.88 at 10,976.89, the blue chips' seventh straight
winning session.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 3.49 at 1,482.81, and the Nasdaq composite index fell
14.44 to 3,848.55 after rising 75 points Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A report from the Labor Department Tuesday eased investor
worries over interest rates. Americans' productivity, a key measure
of rising living standards, surged 5.3 percent in the second
quarter, putting productivity gains during the past year at the
fastest pace in 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve has counted on gains in worker productivity
to offset rising wages. The productivity report is one of several
recent economic indicators that show the economy is moderating and
that inflation is under control.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers that were punished by rising interest rates earlier
this year, gained momentum on the productivity report. Among them
were Dow components Home Depot, up $2 at $57, and Wal-Mart, up
$2.50 at $57.50.
</P>
<P>
   Also leading the Dow higher was Eastman Kodak, up $2.375 at
$60.50 and IBM, up $2.75 at $118.875.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks were mixed as investors waited for Cisco
Systems' second-quarter earnings report, which was issued after the
market closed. Cisco, down 75 cents at $65.50 in regular trading,
beat Wall Street forecasts by a penny. In after-hours trading, the
company's stock was up $2.875 to $68.375.
</P>
<P>
   Trading is ''not as robust as I thought it would be given the
strong second-quarter productivity report,'' said John Shaughnessy,
chief investment strategist at Advest Inc. of Hartford, Conn. But
he said investors remain cautious ahead of retail sales and
producer price index reports due out later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said the productivity report will eventually have a
calming effect on investors nervous about the Fed policymakers
meeting scheduled for Aug. 22. ''With the stronger-than-expected
productivity and increase in hourly earnings around 1 percent
there's good reason for people to be calm,'' Shaughnessy said.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon Communications, the offspring of the Bell Atlantic-GTE
merger that has been struck by communications workers, released
second-quarter earnings that fell short of forecasts. Verizon fell
$5.812 to $42.063.
</P>
<P>
   Other high-tech stocks fell victim to profit-taking, including
Intel, down $1.313 at $61.625, and Dell Computer, down $1 at
$41.688.
</P>
<P>
   But there were also signs of strength in technology, as
Microsoft rose $4.125 to $74.125 and Oracle added $1.125 to $83.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Dow has more stocks with upside potential,'' said Arthur
Hogan, chief market analyst at Jeffries &AMP; Co., in trying to explain
the Dow and Nasdaq's divergent paths.
</P>
<P>
   Tech stocks, however, should rise Wednesday following Cisco's
positive earnings report, he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume came to 1.19
billion shares, up from Monday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 1.15 at 508.72.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.14 percent,
Germany's DAX index was up 0.15 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was
down 0.46 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 0.21 percent.

<HEADLINE> Pataki signs bill barring Con Ed from passing outage costs to customers </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Consolidated Edison will be barred from
charging customers with costs related to the outage at its Indian
Point 2 nuclear power plant under a bill signed into law by Gov.
George Pataki Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the legislation, the state Public Service Commission is
prohibited from allowing the utility to apply replacement costs
incurred since the Feb. 15 outage to its utility base or otherwise
pass through charges to ratepayers.
</P>
<P>
   The PSC will also be required to order Con Ed to refund any
outage-related costs charged to ratepayers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Con Ed must be held accountable for its failures, which
clearly led to this shutdown,'' Pataki said. ''New Yorkers should
not be forced to pay for Con Ed's mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Con Ed spokesman Joseph Petta said the utility plans to
challenge the matter in court.
</P>
<P>
   ''In passing unlawful legislation, the state sends a message to
all of its citizens and corporations that politics overrides sound
public policy,'' Petta said. ''We are confident that the courts
will recognize that this bill is unconstitutional.''
</P>
<P>
   It is costing the utility about $600,000 a day to buy
replacement electricity, and Petta said that would add about $2 a
month to the typical electric bill of a residential customer.
</P>
<P>
   A leak in a tube at the plant carrying radioactive water
resulted in the release of a minute amount of radioactive steam
into the atmosphere. There was no measurable effect on the
environment and no one was injured, but it resulted in the first
alert in the 26-year history of the Westchester County plant.
</P>
<P>
   A Nuclear Regulatory Commission report on the outage concluded
that if Con Ed had done a more thorough job, it would have been
able to predict ''an increased probability of tube leakage or
rupture'' by June 2000.
</P>
<P>
   According to the PSC, refunds to ratepayers are expected to
total about $162 million and will appear in September bills.
Ratepayers will also not be charged approximately $60 million in
replacement costs that Con Ed is expected to spend until defective
steam generators are replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, state Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver sent a
letter to Pataki urging the governor to sign the legislation into
law. Silver applauded Pataki's move later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governor's approval is clearly a step in the right
direction toward reducing soaring electricity costs for millions of
New Yorkers,'' Silver said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's Senate sponsor, Republican Guy Velella of the Bronx,
said the new law ''will send a swift, severe and certain message to
Con Ed - you can't put profits ahead of people.''
</P>
<P>
   The law will remain in effect until the end of the outage or
until all defective steam generation equipment at the facility has
been replaced, whichever happens later.

<HEADLINE> Senators Ready for Leadership Jobs  </HEADLINE>
By CLAUDE R. MARX
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the encouragement of the Senate's top
Republican, two senators could stroll into leadership jobs with no
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania is running for chairman of
the Republican Conference, the No. 3 leadership spot, and Sen. Kay
Bailey Hutchison of Texas is running for conference secretary, the
No. 4 position.
</P>
<P>
   They had planned to compete for conference secretary, but the
death last month of Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., opened the race for
conference chairman. Coverdell had announced plans to run for
chairman to replace Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., who is not seeking
re-election. Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., persuaded
Santorum and Hutchison to avoid a potentially divisive race.
</P>
<P>
   Santorum has said that his youth, ideology and geography are his
best assets for the leadership. A strong conservative, he has been
active on such issues as welfare reform and the fight to ban the
procedure that opponents call ''partial-birth'' abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison's chief of staff, David DiRita, said the secretary
spot is a good match for her talents.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a natural development to formally join the leadership
since she's been working closely with the majority leader in
getting our message out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison, a former television reporter, is a frequent party
spokeswoman on such issues as tax reform and welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., and Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., are also
considering running for leadership spots but their spokesmen said
Tuesday they had not made any final decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The leadership races are scheduled for December.
</P>
<P>
   The conference chairman helps the majority leader and assistant
majority leader set the agenda and runs conference meetings, while
the conference secretary coordinates efforts among Senate
Republicans to devise communications strategy and policy positions.
</P>
<P>
   Both Hutchison and Santorum, meanwhile, are running for
re-election this year.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison is heavily favored over Gene Kelly, a retired military
attorney who has lost six previous statewide races, while Santorum,
challenged by U.S. Rep. Ron Klink, D-Pa., has a 20-point lead
according to a Keystone Poll released last month.
</P>
<P>
   Santorum would be the only northeasterner and the first
Pennsylvanian in the GOP leadership since the late Sen. Hugh Scott
was minority leader from 1969 to 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison would be the first woman in the GOP leadership and the
first Texan to be a party leader since Sen. Lyndon B. Johnson was
the Democratic leader in the 1950s.

<HEADLINE> Concorde Pilot Buried in France  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VILLARS-COLMARS, France (AP) -- About 500 mourners gathered in
this village Tuesday to bury the pilot of the Concorde plane that
crashed last month, as Air France promised that victims' families
would receive compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Pilot Christian Marty was among 113 people killed when the
luxury jet crashed outside Paris shortly after takeoff on July 25.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and family, including Marty's widow and two children,
attended the open-air Mass held at a children's playground in the
main square of Villars-Colmars. Marty's widow is a native of the
region in southeast France.
</P>
<P>
   Marty was credited for trying to steer the plane toward a small
airstrip and away from populated areas as its engines spewed out
fire seconds into takeoff. The plane crashed into a hotel in a
rural area.
</P>
<P>
   Among those at the funeral was Air France President Jean-Cyril
Spinetta.
</P>
<P>
   The airline's chief financial officer, Philippe Calavia, told
reporters that the company's insurers would compensate the families
of the crash victims in accordance with international laws. But he
did not specify the sums that would be involved.
</P>
<P>
   He said the carrier's priority has been ''moral and financial
aid to families of victims,'' not its own financial concerns in the
wake of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Calavia said the suspension of Concorde flights following the
crash has not caused Air France a significant loss in income
because the luxury fleet is only ''slightly profitable.''
Passengers are not shying away from Air France since the crash, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the airline may have to devise flight alternatives if the
Concorde remains grounded, as the French Transportation Ministry
ordered while investigators try to figure out the cause of the
crash.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I can say is that if the fleet remains grounded, we'll
have to imagine a new program concerning flights on North Atlantic
routes,'' Calavia said. ''There are passengers using the Concorde,
and they won't disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that it is ''much too early'' to speculate about the
future of the Concorde.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Envoy To Visit North Korea  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- A U.S. envoy will visit North Korea
this week to urge the isolated communist country to clear its
record on terrorism before the outside world can embrace it as a
good neighbor, U.S. officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Sheehan, U.S. coordinator for counter-terrorism, is
leading a delegation that will hold talks in Pyongyang, the North
Korean capital, on Wednesday and Thursday, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In Seoul, U.S. diplomats said Sheehan will explain the steps the
North must take to be considered for removal from the U.S. list of
state sponsors for terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher in Washington
confirmed the trip, saying that the last round of talks between the
United States and North Korea on terrorism took place in New York
in March.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea is one of seven countries branded by the U.S. State
Department as a sponsor of terrorism. Under U.S. law, this bars all
but humanitarian aid to the Pyongyang government and rules out bank
loans from international financial organizations, which are heavily
influenced by Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking reconciliation with North Korea, South Korea is trying
to help the impoverished North work more closely with the
international finance system by winning membership in such
institutions as the Asian Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States and Japan ruled out even observer status
in the bank unless the North's hard-line leaders address
international fears that the country sponsors terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Sheehan first took up the subject in talks with North Korean
Vice Foreign Minister Kim Gye Gwan in New York in March.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials reportedly demand that North Korea publicly
renounce terrorism and expel all terrorism suspects before it can
be considered for removal from their list.
</P>
<P>
   Pyongyang was put on the terrorism list because of involvement
in the midair bombing of a South Korean airliner near Burma, now
Myanmar, in 1987. All 115 people on board the Korean Air plane
died.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has normalized ties with Italy, Australia and the
Philippines this year in gestures apparently aimed at easing
international concerns over the country and facilitating outside
economic aid.
</P>
<P>
   The North also is pursuing better relations with the United
States and Japan. Its leader, Kim Jong Il, held an unprecedented
summit in June with South Korean President Kim Dae-jung.

<HEADLINE> Russian Cops Report Foiled Murder  </HEADLINE>
By ANGELA CHARLTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Security officials said Tuesday they had foiled an
attempt to assassinate a prominent governor over an apparent
property dispute in the aluminum industry -- one of the most
lucrative and allegedly crime-ridden sectors of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Security Service said the key suspects were arrested
and accused of planning to poison Aman Tuleyev, a presidential
candidate who came in fourth in the March election.
</P>
<P>
   Tuleyev, governor of the Kemerovo region in western Siberia,
said in a statement that the plot appeared linked to attempts to
gain control of metallurgy factories in his province.
</P>
<P>
   Russian news reports suggested a possible link to organized
crime and said Tuleyev's assassins had been promised $700,000 for
the hit.
</P>
<P>
   The security service confirmed that suspects had been arrested
in raids Monday in Moscow and Novosibirsk in Siberia, but declined
to give any details, including why Tuleyev may have been targeted.
</P>
<P>
   While contract killings involving disputes over control of
businesses and public funds are commonplace in Russia, they rarely
involve such prominent figures.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I took over the region three years ago, it was in the
hands of criminal mobs,'' Tuleyev said on Russia's RTR television
Tuesday night. ''Professional criminals sat on the boards of
directors at numerous companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuleyev mentioned the Kuznetsk Metallurgical Combine, the
Novokuznetsk Aluminum Plant and some coal mines. The plants had
been owned by the MIKOM conglomerate until Tuleyev's administration
declared them bankrupt earlier this year, and assigned
representatives from the influential Siberian Aluminum conglomerate
to take over.
</P>
<P>
   Siberian Aluminum is part of the financial empire run by Roman
Abramovich, a secretive tycoon believed to have close links to the
Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   The director of MIKOM, Mikhail Zhivilo, was reported missing
Tuesday, the Interfax news agency said. Police searched MIKOM's
offices in Moscow as part of the probe into the plot against
Tuleyev, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuleyev and MIKOM had clashed frequently, and the governor once
sent police into the Kuznetsk's steel mill to oust a top manager.
MIKOM offices were not answering the phones Tuesday.

<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - U.S. Sen. Joseph Lieberman, the new
Democratic nominee for vice president, has won praise nationally as
a moderate willing to reach across party lines.
</P>
<P>
   But back in Connecticut, his Republican Senate opponent attacked
Lieberman as a ''chameleon'' whose conservative talk masks a
liberal voting record.
</P>
<P>
   Waterbury Mayor Philip Giordano, who is challenging Lieberman
for a U.S. Senate seat, denounced the two-term senator as ''a very
extreme liberal'' whose views do not represent the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''When it really counts, Lieberman sticks with his party,''
Giordano said, attacking Lieberman's record on Social Security,
crime, taxes and a host of other issues.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference at the Legislative Office Building Tuesday
- just minutes before Lieberman officially joined the Democratic
ticket in Nashville - Giordano criticized dozens of votes Lieberman
has made in his 12-year Senate career.
</P>
<P>
   Giordano handed out a 40-page report entitled ''The Worst of
Senator Joseph Lieberman,'' in which he slammed Lieberman for votes
he said failed to protect seniors, funded pornography and even left
children open to attack by pedophiles. Giordano denied he was
making personal attacks and said he was merely exposing Lieberman's
true record.
</P>
<P>
   ''Records are a matter of target, if you will,'' Giordano said,
adding that his own service as Waterbury mayor and state
representative is also open to scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman in Lieberman's Senate office declined to comment
Tuesday, but a spokesman for the Gore-Lieberman ticket said from
Nashville that Giordano's claims were off base. ''I think it's
pretty clear, when you hear Democrats and Republicans unanimously
praising Joe Lieberman as a moderate, independent voice and a man
of integrity, no matter how much paper you produce (attacking him),
you are screaming into the wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic state Chairman Edward L. Marcus ridiculed Giordano's
attack as the act of a ''desperate'' man, noting that Giordano
trailed Lieberman by 57 percentage points in a recent poll.
</P>
<P>
   ''With this kind of campaign it's no wonder the city of
Waterbury is in the shape that it's in,'' Marcus said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more sensational charges made by Giordano involved a
1990 vote he said showed Lieberman was ''opposed to protecting
children from pedophiles.'' The bill involved organizations in
Washington, D.C., that were seeking to bar ''any person convicted
of or charged with a sexual offense involving a minor from coaching
or teaching,'' Giordano's memo said. But when asked what
organizations, specifically, were targeted in the legislation,
Giordano said he did not know.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was accusing Lieberman of supporting pedophiles,
Giordano said no, but added, ''He certainly had an opportunity to
protect children from pedophiles and he didn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Giordano also attacked Lieberman for supporting funding for the
National Endowment for the Arts, even though the agency has
sponsored works that some consider obscene or pornographic, and
criticized Lieberman for voting to increase the federal gas tax and
opposing bills to eliminate the so-called marriage penalty,
eliminate estate taxes for the wealthy and outlaw flag burning.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to impose horseshoe crab moratorium on Virginia  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER THORNE
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEWES, Del. (AP) - The federal government will shut down
Virginia's horseshoe crab fishing industry because the state has
refused to comply with caps on crab harvests, U.S. Commerce
Secretary Norman Mineta said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mineta said the moratorium on horseshoe crab fishing in Virginia
waters would be imposed next month unless the state takes steps to
drastically reduce the amount of horseshoe crabs fished out of its
waters or brought to Virginia ports by trawlers that fish federal
waters.
</P>
<P>
   The federal ban would prohibit Virginia watermen and seafood
packing companies from catching, possessing or selling horseshoe
crabs.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia was warned in June that it is out of compliance with
goals to reduce horseshoe crab harvests, goals set by the Atlantic
States Marine Fisheries Commission. The other 13 of the 14 coastal
states have either banned horseshoe crab fishing outright or begun
reducing harvests by 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   With its $7 million conch fishing industry, Virginia is the
biggest consumer of horseshoe crabs. The plan to reduce the
horseshoe crab harvest puts an unfair burden on Virginia, said Rick
Robins, export manager with the Newport News, Va.-based Chesapeake
Bay Packing LLC, which processes and exports conch.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul Woodley, Virginia's secretary of natural resources,
said Virginia has managed to cut the demand for crabs by requiring
fishermen to put horseshoe crabs in mesh bags before putting them
in the conch and eel pots. This way the crabs can be used a number
of times.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are two ways to do this,'' Woodley said. ''You can work
on the supply side with quotas ... or you can work on it from the
demand side, which is what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mineta was in Delaware to announce plans for a new moratorium on
horseshoe crab fishing in a 30-mile radius around the mouth of the
Delaware Bay, the world's prime spawning ground of the horseshoe
crab.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Beard, vice president for public policy for the National
Audubon Society, said Virginia's noncompliance with the fisheries
commission plan to cut crab harvests amounts to ''piracy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They (Virginia) have been neutralizing the conservation
efforts of other states,'' Beard said.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone calls to the Virginia Department of Environmental
Quality and the state Marine Resources Commission were not
immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists have long lobbied for federal and state
protection of the horseshoe crab, saying commercial fishing of the
crab has significantly reduced its population. The crabs are a
prized bait for the conch and eel fishing industry, and can be sold
for $1 apiece to fishing boats.
</P>
<P>
   But the crab's eggs, which are laid by the millions in the sands
along the Delaware Bay, are a significant source of food for
migratory birds. And blood drawn from the crab is a significant
medical research tool, allowing pharmaceutical makers to test the
purity of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey was the first state to restrict the fishing of
horseshoe crabs in state waters. Maryland followed, and this year
Delaware adopted its own plan to reduce the horseshoe crab harvest
by 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But trawlers have eluded regulations in those states by scraping
the horseshoe crabs off the bottom of the Delaware Bay and
unloading their catch in Chincoteague, Va., the closest Virginia
fishing port.
</P>
<P>
   On July 25, the Virginia Marine Resources Commission reduced the
allowable number of horseshoe crabs harvested from 710,000 crabs to
355,000. But other members of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries
Commission had expected Virginia to cut its quota to 152,495 crabs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have already made the determination that they are out of
compliance with the commission plan,'' said Penny Dalton, fisheries
director for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,
an arm of the U.S. Department of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia could avoid the federal moratorium by agreeing to
reduce its horseshoe crab catch, but until it does, the federal
government will move toward imposing the moratorium in September,
Dalton said.

<HEADLINE> Residents watch Lieberman officially accept Gore's VP offer  </HEADLINE>
By JUDITH FORMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Joseph Lieberman's voice on Tuesday
boomed from every corner of the Hartford restaurant where he once
celebrated a national college basketball title.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman got the official vice presidential nod from Al Gore in
front of a nation. But at Coach's restaurant, the New Haven senator
spoke to just a few lunchtime stragglers watching the televisions
suspended from the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a good guy, a straight shooter,'' said Mark Dumond, a
salesman from Colchester, who was eating at the bar during his
lunch hour. ''I think it'll benefit Connecticut. He's going to try
to bring stuff back to the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach's is a popular hangout for University of Connecticut
basketball fans and owned by men's coach Jim Calhoun. Lieberman was
there in 1999 when the Huskies beat Duke for the National
Collegiate Athletic Association title.
</P>
<P>
   Around the corner at Max Downtown, the lunchtime crowd was
largely indifferent to the news from Nashville, Tenn. But three
Hartford businessmen said they are glad Lieberman's on the ticket -
even though they are skeptical of Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''Joe Lieberman has a toughness that's really based on integrity
and belief,'' said Peter Aldridge of Wethersfield. ''Of all the
politicians I've seen, I believe he belongs up there. I would
absolutely put Joe Lieberman on an international stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Lieberman is one of the few Democrats he's ever voted
for, Peter Barrett of East Hampton said he still remains ''not a
fan of Al Gore's.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't be that close to what Clinton is all about and not
be tainted in some way,'' Barrett said.
</P>
<P>
   A group of about 35 rabbis and community leaders gathered at the
Jewish Federation's West Hartford office to watch the first Jew to
officially join a major-party ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a great sense of hope,'' said Ethan Felson, executive
director of the Jewish Community Relations Council of the Jewish
Federation of Greater Hartford. ''This symbolizes that any American
- including an American Jew - can do and be anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Felson said he is confident that Gore chose Lieberman for his
merits, not his religion. And, Felson said, the public won't be
swayed by Lieberman's Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe in my heart that people will view this candidacy on
the merits just as they would any other candidate,'' Felson said.
</P>
<P>
   At the state Legislative Office Building, lawmakers watched the
televised announcement in their offices. Senate President Pro
Tempore Kevin B. Sullivan took in the speeches as he lunched on
yogurt and a sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was struck by how good they looked together,'' said the West
Hartford Democrat. ''They look like they fit together. They've been
friends for a very long while.''
</P>
<P>
   In Stamford, the city where Lieberman grew up, there is genuine
excitement about him making it to the No. 2 spot on the Democratic
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   But Lieberman's hometown boy status wasn't enough to change some
voters' minds who watched the announcement at a local sports bar
owned by another famous Stamford native, New York Mets manager
Bobby Valentine.
</P>
<P>
   ''I respect Lieberman because he's stood his ground and turned
against some (traditional) Democratic thoughts,'' said Jeff
LaMonica, a landscape designer from Stamford who plans to vote
Republican. ''He was the first one to chastise Clinton for the
stuff that happened with Monica. God bless him.''

<HEADLINE> Cuban Defection Doesn't Sour Castro  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- The defection of two Cuban doctors in Zimbabwe
hasn't soured President Fidel Castro on a program to send medical
workers to developing countries, state media said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Castro called Cuba's international doctors program ''a
revolution in the medical field'' when he met Monday night with
about 70 workers returning from Gambia, the Communist Party daily
Granma said.
</P>
<P>
   The program sends hundreds of doctors annually to Latin America,
the Caribbean and Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The two Cuban doctors who defected while working at a mission in
Zimbabwe -- Leonel Cordova Rodriguez, 31, and Noris Pena Martinez,
25 -- flew to the United States on Monday, where they have been
granted political refugee status.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors were in Zimbabwe tried to defect in Harare,
Zimbabwe, then disappeared June 2, the day of their hearing before
a Zimbabwean asylum committee.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors accused Zimbabwean security officers of kidnapping
them and helping Cuban diplomats force them on a flight to Havana.
Air France refused to let them board during a stopover in South
Africa after the doctors slipped a note to a crew member saying
they were kidnap victims.
</P>
<P>
   The pair sought temporary refuge in Sweden until the United
States approved their refugee status.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba said the doctors betrayed the medical mission to aid
Zimbabwe's health service but denied any involvement in the alleged
kidnapping.

<HEADLINE> Two Philadelphia brothers charged in stolen credit card scam  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - Two brothers suspected of running a
stolen credit card ring that preyed on movie theater patrons were
captured outside a casino, authorities said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cherode Spence, 39, and Sidney Spence, 34, both of Philadelphia,
had been wanted for months in connection with the theft of credit
cards when they were spotted Monday outside Caesars Atlantic City
Hotel Casino, according to state Division of Gaming Enforcement
officials.
</P>
<P>
   State Police assigned to the division arrested the two, who had
been identified previously by 17 women who participated in credit
card scams with them, Gaming Enforcement spokeswoman Katherine
Lyons said.
</P>
<P>
   The two would sneak around in darkened movie theaters, taking
the purses of middle-aged women while the victims were watching
movies and then removing credit cards before returning the purse,
Lyons said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They would only take the credit card. They wouldn't take
anything else, so it took a while for people to notice,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers would then create fake identifications to match the
credit cards and enlist women to pose as the owners of the cards,
appearing at casinos to obtain cash advances of between $500 and
$2,000, according to Attorney General John J. Farmer Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The Spences, who were both wanted on bench warrants for failing
to appear on similar charges here in 1999, were each charged with
one count of theft by deception and one count of using a stolen
credit card. More charges are expected, Lyons said.
</P>
<P>
   Also arrested were Tameka Chante Nash, 26, and Sharon Vidra, 20,
both of Philadelphia. They face the same charges.
</P>
<P>
   The Spences and Nash were being held on $50,000 bail Tuesday.
Vidra was being held on $40,000 bail.

<HEADLINE> Congress Concerned With Census  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional investigators are reviewing
Census Bureau memos and e-mails following allegations from a House
Republican that the agency is not cooperating fully in monitoring
the count.
</P>
<P>
   It has prompted concerns from Census officials and Rep. Carolyn
Maloney, D-N.Y., ranking member of the House Government Reform
Committee's census panel, that the privacy of e-mail messages of
thousands of Census employees may be invaded.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., produced an e-mail from an
unidentified Los Angeles-area census manager instructing
lower-ranking officials not to provide certain daily progress
reports to the General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative
arm. The GAO is helping oversee the once-a-decade count.
</P>
<P>
   Census director Kenneth Prewitt has said there is no policy to
deny GAO any information. Census officials also said that GAO
officials have access to such information through agency computers,
and that such information is also offered by regional-level
management to the GAO.
</P>
<P>
   In a follow-up letter to Prewitt on July 20, GAO associate
director J. Christopher Mihm requested copies of ''any and all
correspondence, memoranda, e-mail messages, and any other form of
communication between officers or employers of the Census Bureau''
concerning GAO or any other oversight body's access to Census data.
</P>
<P>
   Census officials said Tuesday that the request could possibly
entail information from 14,000 computers in 520 offices and more
than 15,000 e-mail accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are in the early stages of a design process for the
study,'' said GAO spokesman Jeff Nelligan. ''We are working closely
with the congressional staffs in doing so.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelligan said the investigation was launched after letters from
Miller, chairman of the census subcommittee, and Maloney. But
Maloney's office said her only concern was with the Los Angeles
incident and not other offices.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's almost like the Republicans think that getting an
accurate census should be considered a crime and those who are
working to count Americans should have their privacy invaded on a
whim. It is outrageous and I hope that the GAO will refuse to
proceed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have no idea of the scope, magnitude, cost or operational
burden that this would impose except to say that it's massive,''
Census spokesman Steve Jost said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think it's important to know whether or not the Census
Bureau has intended to fully cooperate with oversight committees,''
Miller's spokesman Chip Walker said.

this: Five civilians who competed for ''fantasy careers'' in the
military won the right to spend a few days living the role of
soldier, sailor or airman.
</P>
<P>
   The winners are a middle-aged salesman, a teen-age student, a
United Airlines service representative, an eighth-grade teacher and
a 22-year-old woman attracted to the idea of a career in the Coast
Guard.
</P>
<P>
   They were selected from among 3,355 who submitted essays in a
gimmick contest developed by the Yahoo! Internet company. The
Pentagon approved it as a way to boost recruitment and raise
awareness of the military among ''influencers'' -- such as teachers,
who influence young people's career choices.
</P>
<P>
   Contestants had to be U.S. residents 18 or older, complete an
entry form, submit a resume and answer a simple essay question
through Yahoo! It is part of the Pentagon's effort to make more use
of the Internet for recruiting and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Rosalyn-Sue Smith, 18, of Marietta, Ga., was chosen by the Army
to spend several days in September at Fort Rucker, Ala. She will
train with an Apache helicopter pilot and do a tandem parachute
jump with the Army's Golden Knights.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a student at Kennesaw State University north of Marietta,
wrote in her winning essay, ''Since I was a young girl, the
tradition, history and brotherhood that come along with the right
to be called an American soldier have captivated and inspired me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force chose Dale E. Zimmerman, 22, of Junction City,
Ore., a student at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.
</P>
<P>
   He says he wants to apply for Air Force officer training school
to become a pilot. His ''fantasy career'' will be two days at
Tyndall Air Force Base, near Panama City, Fla., an honorary jet
pilot in training.
</P>
<P>
   ''Being blessed with the opportunity to spend a day shadowing an
F-15 pilot will give me a taste of what is to come,'' he wrote in
his winning essay. ''It will at least hold me over until I can have
the honor of strapping into my own jet every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Corps chose Richard A. Castanet, 47, of Richmond,
Va., who will spend several days in September at the Basic School
at Quantico, Va., and at Parris Island, S.C., where new recruits
are trained.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he looked forward to most, Castanet said, ''Being
with Marines (and) being a Marine.''
</P>
<P>
   The Navy selected Joseph W. Blondo, 31, of Budd Lake, N.J., who
will fly to an Atlantic Fleet aircraft carrier to observe
operations. He teaches U.S. history to eighth-graders at South
Plainfield Middle School in South Plainfield, N.J. He said he
aspires to teach history at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis,
Md.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Navy was my career goal since I was a freshman in high
school,'' he wrote. ''Bad knees kept me from achieving that goal.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Coast Guard, it will be Stephanie Kelley, 22, who
recently graduated from Duke University in Durham, N.C., with a
biology degree. She will travel to Houston and Galveston, Texas, to
experience several facets of search and rescue operations,
including training as a rescue swimmer.
</P>
<P>
   ''This opportunity to be a part of the search and rescue team
for a day could be the clinching moment -- whether I shed my
civilian clothing to try for a position within the U.S. Coast
Guard,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly what the Coast Guard and the other services hope
the ''fantasy careers'' exercise will accomplish: Spread the word
of the careers available in the military.

<HEADLINE> Georgia Seeks Red Cross Workers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) -- Georgian authorities are negotiating for
the release of three Red Cross workers kidnapped near the Chechen
border, the Interior Ministry said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The workers disappeared last week and had been feared kidnapped
by Chechen gunmen. The ministry said that the three were kidnapped
and that talks have begun on securing their release.
</P>
<P>
   The ministry would not say who the captors are or give any other
details.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross in Georgia said earlier Tuesday that it had
suspended its work with refugees in Georgia near the Chechen border
after the disappearance. The refugees fled fighting between
separatist rebels and Russian troops in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still have no contact with our colleagues,'' Red Cross
spokeswoman Pauline Serneux said in the Georgian capital Tbilisi.
</P>
<P>
   The missing team was last seen Friday while on the way to the
Pankisi Gorge, a border district where thousands of Chechen
refugees are staying, the Red Cross headquarters in Geneva said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgian Prosecutor General's Office said Tuesday they have
information the aid workers were abducted and that they are alive,
but declined to release any details.
</P>
<P>
   The missing workers were from France, Italy and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   International aid groups pulled out of Chechnya and surrounding
regions after a wave of kidnappings and killings of Russians and
foreigners that followed the 1994-96 Chechnya war.
</P>
<P>
   Six Red Cross workers were shot to death in 1996 as they slept
in a hospital compound in Noviye Atagi in Chechnya and at least
three foreign aid workers were kidnapped in the republic in recent
years.

<HEADLINE> 7 Die in Explosion in Moscow Square  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW KRAMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- A bomb tore through a crowded underground walkway
in central Moscow on Tuesday, killing at least seven people and
sending wounded pedestrians staggering out, their clothes singed,
tattered and soaked in blood.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicion for the bombing immediately fell on Chechen rebels,
and there were fears of a renewed terrorist onslaught in the
Russian capital.
</P>
<P>
   The blast shook the crowded walkway filled with kiosks in
Pushkin Square during evening rush hour. Pedestrians, many with
limbs bleeding, stumbled up the steps from the passageway to the
surface, shouting and coughing, while others ran for cover.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers later dragged burned corpses out of the tunnel past
charred heaps of kiosks.
</P>
<P>
   Emergencies Minister Sergei Shoigu said seven people were killed
and 53 injured in the blast. President Vladimir Putin ordered
police on alert around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should stop speaking about freedom of movement ... We
should realize we are living in the capital of a warring country,''
Alexander Muzikantsky, a Moscow city official, told ORT television.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Ministry released descriptions of two suspects,
both men in their late 20s with dark skin and ''apparently from the
Caucasus region,'' Russian television reports said. Chechnya is in
the Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   Police said there was no immediate claim of responsibility for
the blast. Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov said city prosecutors were
treating it as a terrorist attack and that Chechens could be to
blame. Chechen rebels were blamed for a series of apartment
bombings last fall that killed around 300 people and in part
prompted the Kremlin to launch the current war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Korzhenikova, a 19-year-old saleswoman who was working in
one of the kiosks that lined the passageway when Tuesday's blast
hit, wandered around dazed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought if I don't get out now I'll die,'' she said. ''I was
sitting reading a book ... then the lights went out. The door I was
supposed to go through was jammed. It was pitch dark, I climbed
through a window.''
</P>
<P>
   She had a scrape on her shoulder, her sleeve was bloody and her
face was covered in dust. She was barefoot because she had taken
off her shoes for relief from the summer heat before the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Pushkin Square is one of the busiest junctures in Moscow,
adjoining two major streets and three subway stations less than a
half mile from the Kremlin and a few hundred meters from the Moscow
mayor's office.
</P>
<P>
   Luzhkov told reporters early Wednesday that the suspects
apparently approached a kiosk in the passageway and tried to buy
something with dollars, but the vendor wouldn't accept them. The
suspects then said they would go exchange the money for rubles, and
left their bag behind.
</P>
<P>
   ''Almost right then, the bag exploded,'' Luzhkov said.
</P>
<P>
   People outside the walkway said the blast barely disturbed them
and sounded like a minor car accident. Only as blood-soaked people
began stumbling out was it clear what happened, said Galina
Romanova, who sells ice cream in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Police and security agents flooded the square, pushing
frightened onlookers back toward a McDonald's restaurant as smoke
gushed from the passageway.
</P>
<P>
   A second bomb was found and defused near the scene, the Interfax
news agency said. Officials would not confirm the report.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who gained popularity partly through his tough response
to last year's bombings and handling of the Chechnya war, called an
emergency session of his top law enforcement officials Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's blasts put pressure on the government to show it was
increasing security, and residents in Moscow and other big cities
set up neighborhood patrols to guard homes around the clock. Human
rights activists said police responded to the earlier bombings by
indiscriminately detaining and harassing minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin blamed Chechen rebels for those bombings -- two of
which were in Moscow -- and sent troops into Chechnya a few weeks
later. The Chechens denied responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's blast came two days after Russian security forces had
been on alert in case of possible attacks by Chechen separatists to
mark the Aug. 6, 1996 anniversary of the rebels' capture of the
Chechen capital of Grozny during the first Chechen war.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, security agents seized large batches of
explosives during raids in Moscow and the southern city of Ryazan,
the Interior Ministry said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
The ministry said the explosives were intended for terrorist acts
by Chechen separatists.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. State Department and German Chancellor Gerhardt
Schroeder expressed condolences for the victims of Tuesday's
explosion.

<HEADLINE> Giordano attacks Lieberman's ''Extreme Liberal'' record  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW DALY
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - U.S. Sen. Joseph Lieberman, the new
Democratic nominee for vice president, has won praise nationally as
a moderate willing to reach across party lines.
</P>
<P>
   But back in Connecticut, his Republican Senate opponent attacked
Lieberman as a ''chameleon'' whose conservative talk masks a
liberal voting record.
</P>
<P>
   Waterbury Mayor Philip Giordano, who is challenging Lieberman
for a U.S. Senate seat, denounced the two-term senator as ''a very
extreme liberal'' whose views do not represent the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''When it really counts, Lieberman sticks with his party,''
Giordano said, attacking Lieberman's record on Social Security,
crime, taxes and a host of other issues.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Tuesday - just minutes before Lieberman
officially joined the Democratic ticket in Nashville - Giordano
criticized Lieberman's voting record over his 12-year Senate
career.
</P>
<P>
   Giordano handed out a 40-page report titled ''The Worst of
Senator Joseph Lieberman,'' in which he slammed Lieberman for votes
he said failed to protect seniors, funded pornography and even left
children open to attack by pedophiles. Giordano denied he was
making personal attacks and said he was merely exposing Lieberman's
true record.
</P>
<P>
   ''Records are a matter of target, if you will,'' Giordano said,
adding that his own service as Waterbury mayor and state
representative is also open to scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman spokesman Dan Gerstein would not address Giordano's
claims.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a really special day and proud day for Sen. Lieberman.
He doesn't want to spoil it by getting dragged down into some petty
politics,'' said Gerstein.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic state Chairman Edward L. Marcus ridiculed Giordano's
attack as the act of a ''desperate'' man, noting that Giordano
trailed Lieberman by 57 percentage points in a recent poll.
</P>
<P>
   ''With this kind of campaign it's no wonder the city of
Waterbury is in the shape that it's in,'' Marcus said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more sensational charges made by Giordano involved a
1990 vote he said showed Lieberman was ''opposed to protecting
children from pedophiles.'' The bill involved organizations in
Washington, D.C., that were seeking to bar ''any person convicted
of or charged with a sexual offense involving a minor from coaching
or teaching,'' Giordano's memo said. But when asked what
organizations, specifically, were targeted in the legislation,
Giordano said he did not know.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was accusing Lieberman of supporting pedophiles,
Giordano said no, but added, ''He certainly had an opportunity to
protect children from pedophiles and he didn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Giordano also attacked Lieberman for supporting funding for the
National Endowment for the Arts, even though the agency has
sponsored works that some consider obscene or pornographic, and
criticized Lieberman for voting to increase the federal gas tax and
opposing bills to eliminate the so-called marriage penalty,
eliminate estate taxes for the wealthy and outlaw flag burning.

<HEADLINE> Kashmiri Militants End Cease-Fire  </HEADLINE>
By AMIR ZIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- A Kashmiri militant group called off
its cease-fire with India on Tuesday, saying New Delhi had
squandered a chance for peace in the long and bloody Kashmir
dispute by refusing to let Pakistan join negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   India, however, blamed Pakistan for the setback, accusing it of
pressuring the militant group Hezb-ul Mujahedeen to resume attacks
in the Indian-held part of the Himalayan territory, long a
flashpoint between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
   Though other militant groups had not joined it, the cease-fire
called July 24 by Hezb-ul Mujahedeen had been seen as a ray of hope
for an end to the conflict in Kashmir, where Muslim guerrillas have
been leading a separatist insurgency since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ''This peace offensive has not been reciprocated by India, who
have demonstrated their traditional intransigence,'' Hezb-ul
Mujahedeen chief Sayed Salahuddin told journalists in the Pakistani
capital, Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
   India, however, insisted it was still committed to the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pakistani agencies have put intense pressure on the Hezb-ul
Mujahedeen in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir to sabotage the
cease-fire,'' the Indian government said in a statement Tuesday
after Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee met with his top Cabinet
ministers.
</P>
<P>
   India had halted operations against Hezb-ul Mujahedeen in
response to the cease-fire, though it continued battling with other
militant groups.
</P>
<P>
   Independent Star News television said Indian troops in Kashmir
had gone on high alert after Tuesday's announcement amid concerns
of a resurgence in fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if operations would resume against the Hezb-ul Mujahedeen,
Indian Defense Ministry spokesman P.S. Bhatnagar said only, ''The
Indian army has to take all precautions and steps to maintain
security and safety of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Kashmir, divided between India and Pakistan in 1947, is one of
the most volatile regions in the world and the source of
international concern that an escalation of violence could lead to
a larger conflict between India and Pakistan, the world's two
newest nuclear powers.
</P>
<P>
   India refused Hezb-ul Mujahedeen's demands to include Pakistan
in peace talks. New Delhi has long refused direct talks on Kashmir
with Islamabad, which it accuses of supporting Muslim militant
groups in the territory.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan, which says its support for militants is limited to
political and moral help, insists the 53-year Kashmir dispute
cannot be solved without its involvement.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian government accused Pakistan on Tuesday of encouraging
other militant groups to step up attacks during the cease-fire --
including a string of attacks last week in which militants killed
102 people in two days.
</P>
<P>
   Salahuddin said Hezb-ul Mujahedeen had risked its reputation
with its cease-fire offer. Other guerrilla groups suspended Hezb-ul
Mujahedeen from their umbrella organization, the United Jehad
Council, because of the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   ''It needs to be pointed out that we put our entire credibility
of 12 years at stake for our (desire) to facilitate a peaceful
resolution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kashmir has been the flashpoint for two wars between India and
Pakistan since the end of British rule in the subcontinent. Both
countries claim Kashmir in its entirety.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan has been pressing for a vote by Kashmiris on both the
Indian and Pakistani sides to decide whether a united Kashmir would
join Islamic Pakistan or Hindu India.
</P>
<P>
   New Delhi opposes the vote, which is in keeping with a 1948
United Nations resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Other militant groups welcomed the end to the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no solution but jihad (holy war),'' said a statement
from Al Badr, a sizable fighting group. ''India is our enemy.''
Like Al Badr, the group Lashkar-e-Tayyab said fighting would
continue.

<HEADLINE> FDA OKs Corticosteroid Inhalant  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An inhalant drug that can be used by asthmatic
children as young as 1 year was approved Tuesday by the Food and
Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, sold under the brand name Pulmicort Respules, is a
corticosteroid formulated for use in a nebulizer, a type of fogging
machine. The drug will be the first corticosteroid approved for the
very young.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until now, we haven't had a formulation of corticosteroids for
use by children this young,'' said Dr. John Jenkins of the Food and
Drug Administration. The drug can be used by asthmatics between the
ages of 1 and 8, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins said inhalant applicators that delivered corticosteroids
as a dry powder previously were approved for children no younger
than 4. That application ''required the cooperation'' of the
patient and was not appropriate for the very young, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new formulation of the drug, Jenkins said, allows it to be
administered with a nebulizer, which creates a fog-like aerosol
spray containing the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Young children are given the drug through a breathing mask, he
said. A bit of the drug is inhaled with each breath inside the
mask.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins said the new approval is important because
corticosteroids are the basic maintenance drug for asthma patients.
The drug reduces bronchial inflammation that often precedes an
asthma attack. It is designed for use once or twice daily as an
attack preventive. Acute asthma attacks are treated with a
faster-acting brochodilator drug.
</P>
<P>
   Approval of the new formulation of Pulmicort Respules follows
three 12-week studies involving 1,000 patients between the ages of
6 months and 8 years. All the patients had persistent asthma.
</P>
<P>
   Side effects from the drug included respiratory infection,
congestion and coughing. Patients using the drug should avoid
exposure to chicken pox and measles. Children on the drug who have
not been vaccinated and who become exposed to chicken pox should
see a doctor without delay, the FDA said.
</P>
<P>
   Pulmicort Respules is manufactured by the AstraZeneca Group of
Wayne, Pa.

<HEADLINE> Russians Attack Chechen Region  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- Russian warplanes bombed a Chechen region
along the border with Georgia on Tuesday, seeking to destroy rebel
units that attacked several border posts overnight, an official
said.
</P>
<P>
   Security was tightened in regions bordering the breakaway
republic following a bombing in a busy Moscow square that killed at
least seven people Tuesday evening. No one claimed responsibility
for the blast but Russian officials' suspicions fell on Chechen
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   At least nine Russian checkpoints came under rebel fire during
the night in other parts of Chechnya, including several posts in
the capital Grozny. Several soldiers were killed and wounded in a
shootout in the Grozny district of Chernorechye, said an official.
</P>
<P>
   During the nighttime battle on the border, Russian border guards
were forced to call for artillery support to repel the insurgents,
and intense shelling of the mountainous Itum-Kale district
continued until the morning, said an official in Chechnya's
pro-Moscow administration.
</P>
<P>
   At daybreak, Russian warplanes lifted off to attack suspected
rebel positions and to destroy mountain paths used by insurgents,
said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. There was no
word on casualties on either side.
</P>
<P>
   Russian authorities have repeatedly claimed that rebels are
sneaking into Georgia -- the only foreign country that borders
Chechnya -- to rest and to fetch weapons and reinforcements. Georgia
denies aiding the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Russian artillery also shelled the southern Kurchaloi and Shali
districts, and the Nozhai-Yurt region in the east, where thick
forests and ragged mountains provide cover for small, mobile groups
of rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Russian aircraft also pounded rebel targets just west of
Chechnya in the Russian republic of Ingushetia. The military
command said they were targeting militants who shot at a Russian
helicopter and wounded a paratrooper, ITAR-Tass said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian military officials have repeatedly claimed that the
insurgents are on the verge of defeat, and that rebel fighters are
defecting to the federal side. However, the rebels stage daily
attacks on federal forces throughout the republic, shattering
Russian claims to control any part of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Russian military claimed that rebel field
commander Arbi Barayev executed three of his fighters, whom he
accused of stealing $500,000 from his home, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported. The claim could not be independently verified.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) - U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman
Tuesday declared 35 of the state's counties agricultural disaster
areas due to excessive rain, flooding, high winds and hail.
</P>
<P>
   The declaration, which had been sought by Gov. George Pataki,
makes farmers in those counties eligible for emergency low-interest
loans from the federal Farm Service Agency. Farmers have eight
months to apply for the loans.
</P>
<P>
   Economic losses for apple growers in the mid-Hudson region alone
are already estimated at $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers further upstate likewise stand to lose millions of
dollars due to damaged fields and orchards.
</P>
<P>
   The counties of Columbia, Dutchess, Greene, Monroe, Oneida,
Orange, Saratoga, Schenectady, Schoharie, Ulster, and Yates were
labeled primary disaster areas. Eligible contiguous counties are:
Albany, Delaware, Fulton, Genesee, Hamilton, Herkimer, Lewis,

<HEADLINE> Jerusalem Leaders Talk of Election  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE COPANS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- The leader of the opposition party and a former
ally of Prime Minister Ehud Barak met Tuesday in a flurry of
political activity in preparation for possible early elections.
</P>
<P>
   As part of discussions on a possible alliance prior to
elections, Likud party leader Ariel Sharon met with David Levy, who
resigned as foreign minister last week to protest concessions he
said Barak was making to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting came a week after Barak lost several votes in the
parliament including a preliminary vote on a bill for early
elections. Three parties bolted Barak's coalition last month
complaining he was offering Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat too
much at the Camp David summit.
</P>
<P>
   Both supporters and opponents of Barak say they expect elections
in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   Eli Ishai, a leader of the Shas religious party, which also
withdrew from Barak's coalition, met Tuesday with Benjamin
Netanyahu, who lost the prime minister race to Barak in 1999
elections, Israel Television reported.
</P>
<P>
   The parliament recessed last week for three months, putting off
further votes on the election bill unless a special session is
called. Barak hopes to conclude a peace agreement with the
Palestinians in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   A poll in the Yediot Ahronot daily last week showed Netanyahu
ahead of Barak by 46 percent to 42 percent if he chooses to run in
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu dropped out of politics after the May 1999 election
but has made public appearances recently, and there is growing
speculation he will return to politics. The polls show him faring
better than Sharon, his successor as leader of the hardline Likud
party, in a contest against Barak.

<HEADLINE> Two Car Bombs Explode in Spain  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD BRAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Two car bombs blamed on Basque separatists
went off in Madrid and in northern Spain on Tuesday, killing a
businessman and injuring 11 other people.
</P>
<P>
   The blasts came a day after four suspected members of ETA died
when explosives they were handling exploded inside a car in the
Basque city of Bilbao.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar went on television
to denounce an attack earlier in the day in Zumaia, in the northern
Basque region, that killed one man. Aznar promised to press the
government campaign against terrorist violence.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, a car bomb went off in a residential area of
Madrid, injuring 11 people. Police said they received a telephoned
warning minutes before the explosion from a man who claimed to
represent the Basque group ETA.
</P>
<P>
   One of the injured in Madrid was seriously hurt, city officials
said. Police said the injured included two construction workers, a
security guard and two children.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb in Zumaia also was blamed on ETA, which has killed
nearly 800 people since 1968 and is blamed for eight slayings this
year since the group announced the end of a 14-month cease-fire.
The government insists that ETA used the truce to reorganize and
has now launched a full-fledged offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ETA's goal is to carve an independent homeland out of Basque
areas in northern Spain and southwest France. Interior Minister
Jaime Mayor Oreja this week said he believed ETA's resurgence was
aimed at pushing the government to declare a state of emergency in
the Basque region to try to bring the conflict to a head.
</P>
<P>
   ''The murderers who are part of this terrorist band are not
allowing the Spanish people to live in peace,'' said acting Madrid
Mayor Mercedes de la Merced.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy called the Zumaia explosion
an example of ''barbarity, injustice and lack of respect for the
most fundamental rights that people have as human beings -- life,
freedom to do as they wish and to express their opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities identified the victim in Zumaia as Jose Maria Korta,
52, an entrepreneur and an outspoken critic of ETA who had recently
urged dialogue between the government and the separatist group.
</P>
<P>
   Korta died near his office when he parked his car next to an
explosives-packed car that was detonated by remote control, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   ETA is an acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom in the Basque
language.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Tries to Save Congo Deal  </HEADLINE>
By HRVOJE HRANJSKI
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) -- In a bid to prevent the return of war in
Congo, Rwanda told a U.N. envoy Tuesday it would unilaterally
withdraw from front-line positions and hand them over to U.N.
observers.
</P>
<P>
   The Rwandan initiative would create a 125-mile wide corridor
from Dekese in western Congo to Moba on the eastern shores of Lake
Tanganyika, where Rwandan troops and the allied Congolese rebels
have clashed with President Laurent Kabila's army despite a
year-old cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rwanda doesn't believe in a military solution for Congo,''
said Rwandan presidential adviser Patrick Mazimhaka, who had made
the formal offer.
</P>
<P>
   ''The answer to a question whether we will go to war is no. We
shall try to convince the government in Kinshasa that a solution
lies in negotiated settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   Kemal Morjane, a U.N. envoy for Congo, welcomed the Rwandan
initiative but warned, ''this is something which we need to discuss
further for details'' with Kabila's government.
</P>
<P>
   Rwandan-backed Congo rebels also told Morjane they would pull
back immediately, 6 miles from the front lines at first, then
farther as U.N. forces move in.
</P>
<P>
   The peace accord to disengage warring troops in Congo and make
room for a U.N. force that would oversee their withdrawal from the
country was agreed upon in April by Kabila, the rebels and five
foreign countries backing one side or another.
</P>
<P>
   But the Congolese government has since blocked its
implementation, and rejected an African-appointed mediator for
talks on Congo's postwar government.
</P>
<P>
   Morjane said the United Nations had four battalions from
Pakistan, Senegal and Morocco ready for deployment in Congo, but
that a cease-fire, security for U.N. personnel and their freedom of
movement were still lacking.
</P>
<P>
   Southern African leaders meeting in Windhoek, Namibia, on Monday
called for a summit Aug. 14 on Congo in Lusaka, Zambia. Although
invited to the meeting of the Southern African Development
Community, Kabila failed to show up.
</P>
<P>
   Rwandan army chief of staff, Brig. Gen. Kayumba Nyamwasa said
the Congolese government and their Zimbabwean allies had repeatedly
violated the cease-fire in southern Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Rwandan military officials said they had killed at least 12
government or Zimbabwean soldiers when they tried to break through
Rwanda's defense, on one occasion using a helicopter gunship.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting has also been reported in northern Congo, where a
Ugandan-backed rebel group fought battles with government soldiers,
a rebel spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda and Uganda accuse Kabila of arming the Hutu militiamen
who set up bases in eastern Congo after taking part in the 1994
genocide of more than 500,000 people in Rwanda. But they have
disagreed over which of the three rebel factions to support.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton on Tuesday signed bipartisan
legislation to add the home of Jane Hunt, a pioneer of the women's
rights movement to a historical park in New York, where first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton is running for a Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   Under the legislation, the National Trust for Historic
Preservation will buy the home and donate it to the National Parks
Service to expand the Women's Rights National Historical Park in
Waterloo, N.Y., and Seneca Falls, N.Y. In 1848, early advocates of
women's rights met at the home and resolved to convene the nation's
first women's rights convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''A century and a half later, the addition of the Hunt House to
the historical park is a fitting tribute to all those who have
engaged in the struggle for women's rights,'' Clinton said.

Blasts at Northern Manitoba Smelter Injure 12 Workers
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLIN FLON, Manitoba (AP) -- A series of blasts that injured a
dozen workers at a smelter early Tuesday must be thoroughly
investigated to see if company safety practices were at fault, says
a union official.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will not speculate on the cause until the investigation is
complete,'' Bill Bage, president of the United Steelworkers' Local
7106, said of the accident at the Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting
facility located on the Manitoba-Saskatchewan boundary.
</P>
<P>
   But Bage added the union is concerned about safety at the
worksite.
</P>
<P>
   The blasts occurred about 1:30 a.m. as a furnace was being
cooled down during regular maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the injured workers were flown to hospitals in Winnipeg,
Regina and Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   At least three of those workers were in critical condition. No
one was killed.
</P>
<P>
   The smelter and the copper-zinc mine, found 675 kilometers
northwest of Winnipeg, are the major employers in the area, with
1,400 people on the payroll.
Mudslide Forces Evacuation in Trois-Rivieres, Quebec
</P>
<P>
   TROIS-RIVIERES, Quebec (AP) -- About 30 people were forced out of
their homes Tuesday after heavy rain triggered a mudslide.
</P>
<P>
   No one was injured in the incident, but several homes were
damaged as basements filled with thick mud and water.
</P>
<P>
   Marie-Lou Martel was sitting in her living room when the slide
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ''It sounded like something collapsed,'' Martel told
Radio-Canada's all-news channel, RDI.
</P>
<P>
   ''Then my window broke and I was covered with mud. When we tried
to get out it was hard to open the door.''
</P>
<P>
   The storm began mid-afternoon in this city located halfway
between Montreal and Quebec City.
</P>
<P>
   The drainage system quickly became flooded, leaving drivers to
maneuver through water that covered their vehicles' tires.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the evacuees were expected to return to their homes
later Tuesday. However, at least two or three families were to be
displaced longer because of mud in their basements.
E. Coli Vaccine Moves To Final Testing Stage
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- Federal scientists have teamed up with a venture
capital company to test a potential vaccine against deadly E. coli
bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   If successful, the vaccine could eradicate the E. coli 0157
strain that contributed to the deaths of six people and left
hundreds ill recently in Walkerton, Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   The National Research Council has signed an agreement with
Foragen Technology Ventures Inc. of Guelph, Ontario, to pay for
testing of the vaccine on cattle.
</P>
<P>
   Cattle feces are considered the primary source of E. coli, which
has been found in community well water.
</P>
<P>
   Tests of the vaccine on lab mice have proven effective in
killing the bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Tests on cattle are being conducted this month at the Veterinary
Infectious Disease Organization in Saskatoon.
</P>
<P>
   Results of the clinical trials are expected within two months.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine works by attaching a harmless bacteria to the E.
coli 0157, creating antibodies to kill the deadly strain.

Lt.-Gen. Mike Jeffery Is New Canadian Army Commander
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- Lt.-Gen. Mike Jeffery formally assumed command of
the Canadian army Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffery, who had been working on reorganizing the reserves,
replaced Lt.-Gen. Bill Leach, who will officially retire from the
Forces next month after 40 years of service.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffery is a career artilleryman who rose from apprentice
soldier in 1964, to the ranks of the generals.
</P>
<P>
   He is a former commandant of the Canadian Land Forces Command
and Staff College. He commanded the military's Y2K program last
year.
</P>
<P>
   He had little to say about his plans as he took command.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have only just assumed the reins of command and I really do
have to get a very good sense of where the army is.''
</P>
<P>
   Leach presided during tumultuous times, as deputy commander and
then commander of the army, when the military was struggling with
the Somalia affair, a wide range of reforms and shrinking budgets
and personnel.

<HEADLINE> Republican Ad Denounces Gore  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new Republican ad criticizes Vice President
Al Gore for getting thousands of dollars in royalty payments from a
zinc mining operation on Gore land in Tennessee, alleging the
company has been found polluting a nearby river.
</P>
<P>
   The ad by the Republican National Committee accuses Gore of
hypocrisy for attacking Gov. George W. Bush's environmental record
in Texas, while he ''has allowed mining companies to mine zinc from
his property'' and pollute drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   The ad, part of $3.7 million campaign focusing on environment,
began being aired Tuesday in 17 battleground states from Florida to
New Mexico and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign immediately denounced the ad as being loose
with the facts.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president ''has always insisted that the companies that
operate the mine on his property do so in a way that doesn't harm
the environment,'' said Ron Klain, a senior Gore campaign adviser.
''Where minor problems have arisen they were resolved quickly and
in cooperation with state environmental officials and the operator
of the mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore over the years has acknowledged royalty payments of $20,000
a year from a succession of mining companies that hold leases on
the Gore property near Carthage, Tenn. He has reported the payments
in annual income statements.
</P>
<P>
   The zinc-bearing property located across the Caney Fork river
from Gore's farm was purchased by Albert Gore Sr., in 1973 from
Occidental Minerals, a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum, with
which the senior Gore had had a close relationship. The senior Gore
sold it to his son a year later, passing along the annual royalty
right
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent article in The Wall Street Journal, the
mining companies -- Pasminco Ltd., and a predecessor, Savage Zinc
Inc. -- have been cited four times since 1997 for violating state
water quality standards.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, zinc levels in the Caney Fork near the mine exceeded
the maximum allowed by state and federal water quality standards.
In January, a pipe failure caused too much waste water to escape
into the river.
</P>
<P>
   State officials have acknowledged these problems were quickly
resolved and that overall the mining company has a good
environmental record, said Klain.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's hypocrisy going on here,'' said GOP spokesman Bill
Pascoe, who noted recent attacks by Gore on Bush's environmental
record in Texas. ''This is his own property and it's being cited by
the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation.''
</P>
<P>
   The GOP ad also reiterates claims often made by the Bush
campaign that Texas has dramatically reduced the amount of toxic
releases from industrial plants since Bush became governor in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''George Bush is cleaning up Texas,'' assures a narator in the
ad. ''...Texas leads America in reducing toxic pollution.''
</P>
<P>
   That claim, however, has been the subject of intense dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The ad cites statistics from the federal Environmental
Protection Agency that shows total toxic chemical releases from
Texas industry declined by 43 million pounds between 1995 and 1998,
more than any other state.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Weiss of the Sierra Club calls that figure misleading.
All but about 5 million of those pounds occurred in between 1995
and 1996, early in Bush's tenure, while emissions actually
increased slightly in 1998. Toxic release into water and onto land
increases over the four-year period.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, argues Weiss, the large volume reductions reflect
the huge amounts of toxic chemicals -- 263 million pounds in 1998 --
being released by the state's petrochemical plants and other
industrial sources.
</P>
<P>
   On a percentage basis, Texas has cut toxic industrial pollution
by 14 percent, according to the EPA statistics, with 23 other
states having done better. Still, Texas' record is far better than
the national average of 5.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Bartlett, a Bush campaign spokesman, said the volume figure
is a fair gauge of environmental improvement because it's that much
less pollution being put into the environment. He said the state's
large overall release numbers reflect its high concentration of
petrochemical plants.
</P>
<P>
   Replies Klain: ''The fact is that Texas has led the country in
industrial pollution. Every year since 1995, Texas has been the
most polluted state in the nation, leading in combined releases
into the air, water and soil.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIVERSITY CENTER, Mich. (AP) -- Detroit Lions quarterback
Charlie Batch underwent a successful medical examination, coach
Bobby Ross said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Batch, who broke a bone in his knee in early June, spent the
past two days in Birmingham, Ala., having his injured right leg
examined.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything looked very good medically,'' Ross said. ''The knee
looked good. The calcium buildup was there, and now we have to see
how he reacts to the running phase.''
</P>
<P>
   With Batch still out, the Lions' other quarterbacks had a
productive practice Tuesday. Stoney Case threw three long touch
passes, and Steve Stenstrom and Cory Sauter also threw effectively.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought we made progress offensively in our throwing game,''
Ross said. ''I think we started throwing the ball a little bit
better, timing looked a little bit better and our rhythm on offense
in and out of the huddle was good.''

<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian prosecutors have lifted travel
restrictions on a journalist for U.S.-funded Radio Liberty detained
in Chechnya earlier this year, news reports said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrei Babitsky, who had angered the Russian military by
covering the war in Chechnya from the rebels' side, could not
travel to Romania to receive a prize last month for his Chechnya
reporting because of the travel ban.

   The restrictions were lifted at the request of ''prominent

Ministry spokesman Vladimir Martynov as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky's lawyer Genri Reznik said the request came from

<HEADLINE> Xerox Gunman Gets Life, No Parole  </HEADLINE>
By BEN DiPIETRO
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU (AP) -- A Xerox employee who gunned down seven
co-workers was sentenced Tuesday to life in prison without parole.
</P>
<P>
   Byran Uyesugi was convicted in June of fatally shooting the
seven men and trying to kill an eighth, an attack Deputy Prosecutor
Chris Van Marter described as ''the execution of seven unarmed,
good hard-working men.''
</P>
<P>
   Uyesugi was also sentenced to life with parole by Circuit Judge
Marie Milks for the attempted murder of the eighth man. The judge
also ordered Uyesugi to pay $70,000 restitution to the victims'
families.
</P>
<P>
   His left hand rubbing his chin, Uyesugi appeared not to pay
attention as victims' family members spoke of their pain and
suffering since the November slayings.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hate you for what you have done,'' Susan Sakamoto said
between sobs as she spoke of her husband, John. ''You have stolen
our lives away and you can never suffer enough for what you have
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Lorna Kanehiro's husband, Ford, was also killed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Byran Uyesugi took away my life,'' she said. ''My heart would
leap whenever I saw him. He was my life. It's been nine months and
I still don't know how to pick up the pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   Uyesugi declined to speak in court.
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii has no death penalty, and defense attorney Jerel Fonseca
said he's not sure whether that would have been a deterrent.
Uyesugi believes he was justified in killing the men because he
felt they were sabotaging his work and trying to have him fired,
the attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's always felt he was morally justified,'' Fonseca said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Uyesugi said he plans to appeal.

<HEADLINE> Aristide Party Wins in Haiti  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL NORTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- The electoral council announced the
results Tuesday from the final run-offs in Haiti's drawn-out
elections, confirming that the party of former President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide won dominant control of the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The results came from run-off elections held July 30 for 10
lower-house seats in districts where balloting had been delayed.
</P>
<P>
   Aristide's Lavalas Family party won five of the seats, according
to the election council. Opposition candidates took four while the
determination of the final seat was postponed because of
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   The latest results mean the Lavalas party now holds 75 of the 83
seats of the lower Chamber of Deputies. The party won 18 of the 19
seats that were up for grabs in the 27-member Senate, the upper
house.
</P>
<P>
   The first round of voting was held May 21 and June 11, followed
by run-offs on July 9 and July 30.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament has not been in session since January 1999, when
Aristide's handpicked successor President Rene Preval shut it down
to terminate a prolonged power struggle with the majority party.
</P>
<P>
   Aristide, constitutionally barred from consecutive terms in
office, stepped down in 1996 and is a favorite to win a re-election
bid in November.
</P>
<P>
   Aristide's party also has won 80 percent of city halls and a
majority of urban and rural assemblies.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization of American States observer team has questioned
the formula used to determine winners of the parliamentary
elections, and the United States, Canada and European Union have
threatened to withhold aid if the results are not revised.

   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Cincinnati Reds third baseman Aaron Boone had
reconstructive surgery Tuesday for a torn anterior cruciate

<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. plans to announce
Wednesday a recall of about 20 million tires for light trucks and
sport utility vehicles that have been implicated in accidents
resulting in more than 40 fatalities, a source familiar with the
decision said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Firestone ATX, ATX II and Wilderness AT tires are on
Ford Explorers, the industry's top-selling SUV, but the recall will
include tires on all brands of vehicles, the source said on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The recalled tires will be replaced by other Firestone tires,
the source said.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone/Firestone spokeswoman Marianna Deal said the company
will hold a news conference on Wednesday regarding the tires at the
National Press Club in Washington at 11 a.m. EDT. Ford Motor
Company officials will also attend.
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has received
270 complaints, including reports of 46 deaths and 80 injuries,
about failing Firestone truck tires.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints alleged that Firestone tires peel off their
casings, sometimes while the light trucks or SUVs are traveling at
high speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Dearborn, Mich.-based Ford Motor Co. and Nashville-based
Bridgestone/Firestone had insisted the tires are safe, but the
source told The Associated Press that the two companies decided on
a recall after a private meeting with NHTSA investigators Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Inglis, vice president for Ford North America, said tires
are one of the few features of a new vehicle that are warranted by
a supplier instead of the automaker.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any time a Ford customer is at risk in any shape or manner, we
want to avoid any problems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Liz Neblett, a NHTSA spokeswoman in Washington confirmed that a
meeting occurred with the two companies on Tuesday, but she
declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have really nothing to say about that meeting,'' Neblett
said. ''Since Ford and Firestone have been very good about
cooperating with us, I'm sure the meeting went well.''
</P>
<P>
   Firestone spokeswoman Susan Sizemore declined to comment on
whether Firestone had decided to issue a recall. ''At this point,
we have no news,'' said Sizemore.
</P>
<P>
   Discount Tire, Montgomery Ward and Sears Roebuck and Co. have
stopped selling the tires because of safety concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has replaced Firestone tires for free on vehicles sold in
Venezuela, Ecuador, Thailand, Malaysia, Colombia and Saudi Arabia
after tires failed in those countries, but has resisted pressure to
do so in the United States, saying the matter was under
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The recall will begin immediately in southern states and
eventually spread nationwide, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the accidents reported to NHTSA came from Texas and
southern and southwestern states with warmer climates. Heat can
effect tire tread bonding and may be associated with an increased
rate of tread separation.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors Corp., Nissan Motor Co., Toyota Motor Corp. and
Subaru also sell the Firestone ATX, ATX II and Wilderness AT tires
as original equipment on SUVs and pickups.
</P>
<P>
   All have said they have received no complaints about the tire.
</P>
<P>
   The NHTSA investigation was opened in May and in the preliminary
inquiry stage. An investigation eventually can lead to a recall,
but many are dropped.

<HEADLINE> Study: More Students Smoking Cigars  </HEADLINE>
By MARTHA IRVINE
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A new survey has found that tobacco use by
college students is not limited to cigarettes and that more young
people are smoking cigars, previously a habit associated mostly
with older men.
</P>
<P>
   ''College students are essentially playing with fire,'' said Dr.
Nancy Rigotti, lead author of the survey published in Wednesday's
Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 14,138 students nationwide was part of the 1999
Harvard College Alcohol Survey -- and a follow-up to similar surveys
in 1993 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the 1999 survey found that nearly 46 percent of
students had tried cigarettes, cigars and other tobacco products in
the previous year. A third said they had used tobacco products in
the last 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   When comparing the 1997 and 1999 results, researchers found that
about the same percentage of students -- 28 percent -- said they had
smoked cigarettes in the last 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Nine percent of the respondents, including some who smoked
cigarettes, said they had smoked a cigar in the same time period; 4
percent had chewed tobacco; and 1 percent smoked a pipe.
</P>
<P>
   Rigotti, who presented her survey Tuesday at the 11th World
Conference on Tobacco in Chicago, said this is the first time
students were asked about tobacco items other than cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   She said some of the students first tried cigarettes in middle
or high school and ''have taken their smoking habits with them'' to
college.
</P>
<P>
   But she believes others who would not normally smoke are trying
cigars because students associate them with being ''young, hip,
successful ... and sexy.''
</P>
<P>
   But some, including tobacco retailers, say it's not fair to
compare cigars to cigarettes because most people smoke cigars
occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   ''To the majority of the adults in the world, cigar smoking is
an event -- a happening -- that they do to celebrate the birth of a
child, graduations, weddings,'' said Billy O'Hara, owner of Jack
Schwartz Importer, a downtown Chicago cigar store just a few blocks
from the conference.

<HEADLINE> Judge gives final approval to Synthroid settlement  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) - A federal judge has given final approval to a
settlement calling for hundreds of thousands of users of the
thyroid drug Synthroid and insurance companies to share up to $137
million to settle allegations that the drug's maker suppressed
unfavorable research.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the agreement - granted final approval Aug. 4 by
U.S. District Judge Elaine Bucklo - Mount Olive, N.J.-based Knoll
Pharmaceutical Co. will pay about $91 million to 778,000 consumers,
less attorneys' fees and costs. Consumers will each receive about
$111 if they began taking Synthroid before Jan. 1, 1995, and about
$74 each if they began taking it after that date. The company
agreed to pay another $46 million to insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement agreement was reached in October 1997, following
publication earlier that year of a study that concluded Synthroid,
which dominates the $600 million market for thyroid drugs, was no
better than three cheaper alternatives. The other drugs are two to
three times less expensive than Synthroid.
</P>
<P>
   Knoll, which hired pharmacist Betty Dong from the University of
California at San Francisco to conduct the study in 1990, strongly
disagreed with its results and kept it from being published, Dong
told the Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Knoll admitted no wrongdoing under the settlement, but said it
agreed to the settlement to avoid a prolonged legal battle. The
quality of the drug and the safety of the drug were never
questioned in any of the cases.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Knoll agreed to pay 37 states a total of $41.8
million to settle the same charges made by individual Synthroid
users. Knoll did not admit any wrongdoing in that settlement,
either.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Family Caught in St. Lucia  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA WADHWANI
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Two Silicon Valley fugitives who were
wanted for swindling their insurance clients out of $10 million
turned up on a Caribbean island, almost seven months after
vanishing along with their nanny and two young children.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Morgan and his wife, Kimberly, fled the country facing
charges involving the theft of about $10 million from 700 clients
through their ISU Diligent Insurance Agency in San Jose, said
Stephen Lowney, a deputy district attorney in Santa Clara County.
</P>
<P>
   The Morgans were roused from their beds at 5 a.m. Thursday by
several dozen members of the Royal St. Lucia Police Force and one
investigator from Santa Clara County, Lowney said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They didn't try and run,'' he said. ''They were shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Their escape plans were foiled by their own family members, who
tipped police six weeks ago. Authorities then searched records and
determined the four family members were living under the identities
of their own cousins. The couple even took out credit cards in the
cousins' names, Lowney said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation led authorities to St. Lucia, where the
Morgans had arrived in January. They were living as Randy Sho and
Jeanne Kay Kaneyuki in one of the island's most exclusive
residential areas, and seemed to earn their living by providing
computer services to local businesses, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Morgan's attorney, William Graysen, said the couple
apparently panicked when authorities began investigating them. They
feared for their children if both went to jail.
</P>
<P>
   The couple's children, Taylor, 4, and Connor, 6, were returned
to San Jose on Sunday with the nanny, who is being treated as a
witness and will not face charges, Lowney said.
</P>
<P>
   The Morgans were taken by U.S. marshals on Saturday to Puerto
Rico, where they remain in prison pending an extradition hearing on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Morgans already were accused of embezzling money customers
had given them to invest and collecting premiums for insurance
policies that were never written. They now face charges of identity
theft and unlawful flight to avoid prosecution, Lowney said.
</P>
<P>
   The family had last been seen in mid-January, hastily packing
their belongings into a rented minivan and driving away from their
$950,000 hillside home in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't think much of it at the time. I thought they were
just giving stuff to Goodwill,'' neighbor Karen Simonsen said.
''I'm certainly glad they caught them ... I'm surprised it took
this long.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They just seemed like a normal average typical family ... They
drove a Mercedes, but a lot of people in the neighborhood did,''
neighbor Becky Morales said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the home is boarded up, with a lock box on the door.
Neighbors take turns watering the lawn. The pool is dried up; the
furniture is gone. Last week, someone threw a rock through a front
window, Simonsen said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors hadn't thought the Morgans would flee. Both in their
mid-30s, the couple had no passports and no money left.
</P>
<P>
   But it turned out they had $29,000 in cash, after selling their
leased Mercedes and Toyota Camry, Lowney said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They may convince themselves that they were doing this for
their kids, but if they really cared about their kids they wouldn't
have dragged them halfway across the world and given them fake
names,'' Lowney said.

<HEADLINE> Chile Court Ends Pinochet Immunity  </HEADLINE>
By EDUARDO GALLARDO
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Chile's Supreme Court lifted Gen. Augusto
Pinochet's immunity from prosecution on Tuesday, paving the way for
the former dictator to be tried on human rights charges. But
chances for a quick trial appeared slim.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's supporters in Congress announced a bill to try to
block a trial of the 84-year-old Pinochet on grounds of health.
Pinochet suffers from diabetes, uses a pacemaker and has had three
mild strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Even Eduardo Contreras, a lawyer and Pinochet opponent,
predicted putting Pinochet on trial could take ''up to eight
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet made a surprise appearance at dusk at the front door of
his home to acknowledge cheer and applause by scores of supporters.
Photographers and reporters were kept at distance. He had not been
seen in public since attending the funeral of a former aide on July
16.
</P>
<P>
   The court voted 14-6 to allow Pinochet to be prosecuted on
charges stemming from his 1973-90 rule, court secretary Carlos
Meneses said.
</P>
<P>
   Ensconced in his heavily guarded suburban Santiago mansion,
Pinochet received a show of solidarity from the military, as army
chief, Gen. Ricardo Izurieta, and eight other generals visited.
</P>
<P>
   ''History has not yet been fully written, and when that happens,
you can be assured that Gen. Pinochet will receive the place he
deserves in it,'' Izurieta said.
</P>
<P>
   A government report says 3,197 people died or disappeared at the
hands of Pinochet's secret police after he toppled the country's
elected Marxist president Salvador Allende in a 1973 coup.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to prosecute Pinochet center on the so-called ''caravan
of death,'' a military squad that executed 72 political prisoners
after the coup.
</P>
<P>
   In a 49-page ruling, the court said Pinochet should respond as
to whether he gave authority to the members of the caravan, as the
plaintiffs alleged.
</P>
<P>
   The government said the ruling ''shows the full independence of
the courts and the fact that everybody in Chile is equal before the
law.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Our obligation is to respect what the courts decide,''
President Ricardo Lagos said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States hailed the court's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said,
''The decision is clearly historic. It's significant for Chile, for
the rule of law and for the promotion and protection of human
rights.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The decision affirms the fundamental principle that no one
stands above the law,'' he said. ''We certainly hope that it will
contribute to the resolution of long-pending human rights issues
and further advance the process of justice and reconciliation in
Chile.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court had voted last week, but the decision was only
announced Tuesday once it had been written out and signed by the
justices.
</P>
<P>
   The court turned down Pinochet's appeal of a lower court
decision in June, stripping him of the immunity he had as a
senator-for-life, a post he created for himself in the constitution
written under his regime.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a completely political process from the beginning,''
Pinochet's younger son, Marco Antonio, charged.
</P>
<P>
   ''If a trial takes place, my father will almost certainly not
see its end, but I will fight all the way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and foes of Pinochet were kept a block apart behind
police barricades outside the century-old court building. As the
news of the ruling came, the anti-Pinochet demonstrators, mostly
relatives of victims and members of leftist groups, cheered and
applauded. Many embraced. Some wept.
</P>
<P>
   Viviana Diaz, president of an organization of dissidents missing
under the dictatorship, called the ruling ''a step toward
justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred anti-Pinochet demonstrators marched to the newly
inaugurated monument to Allende outside the presidential palace.
Allende's daughter, congresswoman Isabel Allende, tears in her
eyes, was among the marchers.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's followers were disbanded by police after they shouted
insults and tossed coins and fruit at bystanders.
</P>
<P>
   They later assembled at the Pinochet Foundation to hear its
director, retired Gen. Luis Cortes, call the ruling ''the last link
in a chain or revenge against Gen. Pinochet organized by Chilean
and international socialism.''

<HEADLINE> Hard-Liners Demonstrate in Iran  </HEADLINE>
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Hard-liners protesting outside parliament
called Tuesday for the death and expulsion of reformists who dared
challenge an order from Iran's supreme leader that squelched debate
on easing the country's restrictive press law.
</P>
<P>
   In a second day of protests outside the legislature,
demonstrators called for the execution of lawmaker Mohammad
Rashidian, who sought to debate the proposed changes two days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Traitor Rashidian must be executed!'' the protesters shouted.
</P>
<P>
   Rashidian angered hard-liners because he tried to pursue debate
even after supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's ordered that the
restrictive press laws be preserved untouched.
</P>
<P>
   But the hard-liners called for Rashidian's blood because in his
arguments in parliament broadcast live on national radio Sunday, he
referred to Khamenei as Mr. Khamenei without the title ayatollah,
and implied that the religious leader was not acting in accordance
with Islamic law.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters -- carrying posters of Khamenei and his
predecessor Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the leader of Iran's 1979
Islamic revolution -- called for defiant lawmakers to be expelled.
</P>
<P>
   Khamenei's intervention succeed in quashing debate on amending
the press law, but not before touching off scuffles in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Fallout continued Tuesday over the aborted effort to alter the
press law that allows the hard-line Justice Ministry to close
reformist newspapers and arrest writers advocating change.
</P>
<P>
   Reformist Ahmad Pournejati resigned as head of parliament's
Cultural Committee to protest the ban on debate. His committee had
proposed an amendment that would have given the press greater
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   The Freedom Movement of Iran, the only liberal dissident party
tolerated by the government, expressed concern over Khamenei's
intervention in the parliament's affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ''These kinds of interferences are not in the benefit of the
Islamic republic and not in the benefit of the supreme leader,''
said a statement issued by the group Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Karim Arghandepour, the pro-reform deputy head of Iran's
Press Guild Association, said: ''I think the reformists should at
first try to reduce tensions which are dangerous for reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   He called on reformists to hold talks with senior officials and
lobby for launching new newspapers to enable them to reach the
public.
</P>
<P>
   Reformers in Iran have repeatedly cautioned their supporters not
to do anything that might provoke a violent backlash that could
slow or even destroy their movement.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Ministry, in a statement reported by the official
Islamic Republic News Agency, said that the demonstration was
''illegal'' and warned state-run Iranian television and radio, both
controlled by hard-liners, not to broadcast any news or footage of
it.
</P>
<P>
   But the television and radio defied the order, broadcasting
reports on the protest in their early evening bulletins. State
television showed pictures of the demonstrators chanting outside
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Iran condemned U.S. expressions of ''very serious concerns''
about the press debate as ''meddling in the internal affairs'' of
Iran, IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-liners banned a 25th publication, closing down the
pro-reform Bahar daily, an editor at the paper said.
</P>
<P>
   The latest tensions threaten to worsen a political rift between
Khamenei and supporters of reformist President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   In February elections, Iranian hard-liners lost control of the
legislature for the first time since the Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
   One of the hard-liners' last undertakings in the previous
legislative session was to force through the restrictive press law
-- the basis for banning publications and arrests of journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Since Khatami's 1997 election, the hard-liners have lost much
power, but they still control the judiciary, military and
television network and are backed by Khamenei, who has the last say
on all matters.

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays 5, Twins 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Albie Lopez scattered four hits in
his first shutout in six years as the Tampa Bay Devil Rays beat the
Minnesota Twins 5-0 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez (9-8), in his third complete game of the season, pitched
his first shutout since Aug. 4, 1994, and second of his career. The
right-hander, who has gone at least seven innings in six straight
starts, struck out three and walked three.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays scored all of their runs, highlighted by John
Flaherty's two-run homer, with two outs in the fifth to win for the
ninth time in 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Guillen snapped a scoreless tie with a two-run triple.
Steve Cox, in a 1-for-27 slump, added an RBI ground-rule double.
Flaherty followed with a two-run homer off Brad Radke.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez made his 14th start after 152 consecutive relief
appearances, and pitched his fourth career complete game. He is 7-4
since joining the starting rotation May 28.
</P>
<P>
   Among AL pitchers with a minimum of 13 starts, only Boston's
Pedro Martinez (1.42) had a lower ERA than Lopez (3.55).
</P>
<P>
   Radke (8-12) gave up five runs and nine hits in five innings.
Radke, who went to high school in nearby Tampa, had allowed just
four earned runs in 26 previous innings at Tropicana Field.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez started the game with two perfect innings before Torii
Hunter opened the third with a double. Hunter was later doubled off
third on Danny Ardoin's one-out liner to short.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins had two on with two outs in the sixth, but Lopez
worked out of trouble by retiring Matt Lawton on a grounder. He
duplicated the feat in the seventh by inducing an inning-ending
grounder from Jacque Jones.
Notes: Lopez, while with the Cleveland Indians, blanked the
Detroit Tigers for his only other shutout. ... The Devil Rays held
a promotion that allowed real twins or dress-alike twins to
purchase 2-for-1 tickets in certain sections. The Arena Twins sang
the national anthem. ... Lawton, limited to pinch-hitting duties
the past week because of a sprained toe, returned to the starting
lineup. ... Tampa Bay 1B Fred McGriff has gone 71 at-bats in 21
games since his last homer. He has just one extra-base hit in the
past 13 games. ... Hunter has 11 hits in 20 at-bats during a
six-game hitting streak. ... Tampa Bay SS Felix Martinez snapped an
0-for-17 slump with an infield single in the second.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) - U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman
Tuesday declared 35 of the state's counties agricultural disaster
areas due to excessive rain, flooding, high winds and hail.
</P>
<P>
   The declaration, which had been sought by Gov. George Pataki,
makes farmers in those counties eligible for emergency low-interest
loans from the federal Farm Service Agency. Farmers have eight
months to apply for the loans.
</P>
<P>
   Economic losses for apple growers in the mid-Hudson region alone

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago White Sox recalled right-handed
pitcher Aaron Myette from Triple-A Charlotte between games of a
doubleheader Tuesday night, optioning infielder Greg Norton to make
room on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   Myette was 3-4 with a 4.56 ERA in 13 starts at Charlotte. He was
in the bullpen and available for relief duty in Chicago's second
game against the Seattle Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   This is Myette's second stint in the majors. He made three
starts last year, going 0-2 with a 6.32 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   But Myette's biggest claim to fame with the White Sox came in
spring training this year, when he broke his right hand after he
punched a wall in disgust after a bad outing.
</P>
<P>
   Norton was hitting .260 with five home runs and 24 RBIs. He
began the season as the White Sox starting third baseman, but he
lost his job to Herbert Perry, who is hitting .318 with 10 homers
and 38 RBIs.

<HEADLINE> Mitchell's WL Suspension Lowered  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICO, Calif. (AP) -- Former NL MVP Kevin Mitchell's expulsion
from the independent Western Baseball League was reduced to a
nine-game suspension on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, the former San Francisco Giants star, was originally
expelled last week after punching the owner of an opposing team.
</P>
<P>
   Sonoma County owner Bob Fletcher appealed the ruling by
commissioner Bob Linscheid to the league's owners. Fletcher
rescinded his appeal Tuesday and instead asked for a modified
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Linscheid the reduced the suspension to nine games, fined
Mitchell an undisclosed amount, demanded a public apology, and
ordered Mitchell to perform one youth clinic in each visiting
ballpark for the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The brawl between Sonoma County Crushers and Solano Steelheads
occurred Aug. 1. Mitchell hit Solano owner Bruce Portner, who had
come on the field, soon after the fight had broken up. Portner was
left with a black eye and said he planned to press assault charges
against Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   The fight began when Jim Converse threw a pitch behind Mitchell
in retaliation for a brushback pitch. Mitchell rushed the mound and
punched Converse in the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   The Western league also fined Portner an undisclosed amount and
suspended Converse for one start and fined him.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, 38, was the 1989 NL MVP while playing for the Giants.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Helps Colombia Fight Drugs  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW SELSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- U.S. Special Forces have begun training
Colombian soldiers at a jungle base, officials said Tuesday, as a
$1.3-billion U.S. aid initiative to help Colombia fight drugs and
rebels gets under way.
</P>
<P>
   ''Colombia is in a risky position,'' said Barry McCaffrey,
President Clinton's point man on the war on drugs. ''They've got a
peace process that's going nowhere, and a drug production problem
that's skyrocketing.''
</P>
<P>
   The 83 U.S. military personnel are working with members of a
Colombian anti-narcotics battalion at Larandia military base,
Colombian and U.S. officials said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The base is in the Amazon River basin only a two-hour drive from
the main stronghold of the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. troops are barred from accompanying Colombian soldiers
into combat. Although FARC has declared it will fight the anti-drug
offensive, it has not threatened to attack the U.S. soldiers
directly.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S.-trained Colombian troops -- backed by donated Black Hawk
and Huey combat helicopters -- are to seize vast swaths of
drug-producing areas from FARC and other armed groups, which use
drug proceeds to buy weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Airplanes could then destroy the crops of coca and poppy, which
produce cocaine and heroin respectively, by aerial spraying without
risk of being shot down.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's aim is to stem the flow of drugs into the United
States and shore up Colombia's democratically elected government.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now starts the hard part of actually doing it,'' McCaffrey, a
former army general, told reporters in Mexico City. He planned to
travel Wednesday to Colombia, where he was to meet with Colombian
President Andres Pastrana and review the aid program.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring Washington's stake in the anti-drug effort, Clinton
is scheduled to visit Colombia on Aug. 30 -- the first trip by a
U.S. president to Colombia since George Bush came in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey will be accompanied by Under Secretary of State Thomas
Pickering and Gen. Charles Wilhelm, commander in chief of the U.S.
Southern Command, which oversees military operations in Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   Under the aid package passed by Congress and signed by Clinton
last month, no more than 500 U.S. troops and 300 contractors can be
in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   One Colombian battalion previously trained under an earlier aid
package is deployed at Tres Esquinas base near the heart of
Colombia's coca-growing region. The two additional battalions to be
trained under the current package were expected to also operate
from Tres Esquinas.
</P>
<P>
   The battalion undergoing training is expected to be operational
by December. The Pentagon said Tuesday the American soldiers are
from units including the 7th Special Forces Group and the 720th
Special Tactics Group.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Juan Gonzalez hit a go-ahead two-run double in
the fifth inning and Brian Moehler pitched his 10th career complete
game as the Detroit Tigers beat the Baltimore Orioles 4-1 Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Damion Easley homered for the Tigers, who won for the first time
in five games against the Orioles this season.
</P>
<P>
   Moehler (8-7) won his second straight start after losing three
of his previous four decisions, and improved to 6-2 at Comerica
Park.
</P>
<P>
   Moehler allowed one run, eight hits, struck out seven -- matching
a season-high -- and walked one in his second complete game of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez was just 1-for-19 during the Tigers' homestand when he
hit a bases-loaded opposite-field double off Pat Rapp (6-9) to
drive in two runs and give Detroit a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Palmer's sacrifice fly gave Detroit a 3-1 lead, and Easley
led off the seventh with his nine home run.
</P>
<P>
   Rapp, 2-7 in his last 13 appearances, allowed four runs -- three
earned -- and six hits in seven innings. He walked four and struck
out five.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin Mora was 4-for-4 with a double for the Orioles, who are
2-3 on a 10-game road trip but have won six of their last 10.
</P>
<P>
   Mora and Delino DeShields singled to set up Albert Belle's
run-scoring RBI groundout in the third to give the Orioles a 1-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Mora's four hits matched his career high reached June 25
against Pittsburgh when he was with the New York Mets. ... The
Tigers' fifth-inning rally was helped by a catcher's interference
call against Brook Fordyce. It was the second catcher's
interference call at Comerica Park in three days. Detroit's Brad
Ausmus was charged with it Sunday against Minnesota. ... Orioles 3B
Ryan Minor played for the first time since Aug. 1, three days after
he came off the disabled list from a strained left ribcage muscle.
... Rapp has just three wins in his last 19 appearances.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Liberty, led by Tari Phillips' 14
points, clinched their second consecutive Eastern Conference title
with a 57-44 victory over the Cleveland Rockers Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Crystal Robinson and Becky Hammon added 11 points apiece for the
Liberty, who extended a franchise record with their 10th straight
home victory before a crowd of 18,663 at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   New York (20-11), winners of 13 of 15, will face either
Washington or Detroit in the first round of the Eastern Conference
playoffs beginning Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Merlakia Jones had 21 points and was the only player in double
figures for the second-place Rockers (17-14), who have dropped five
of six road games. Cleveland has already clinched a playoff spot
</P>
<P>
   Phillips had 11 rebounds and two steals and Teresa Weatherspoon
added seven assists and six steals for New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockers committed 19 turnovers that were converted into 17
Liberty points.
</P>
<P>
   New York led 53-41 before Jones' 3-pointer brought the Rockers
within nine points with 2:15 remaining. The Liberty held the
Rockers scoreless the rest of the way as Phillips hit a baseline
jumper and Robinson added a basket to close out the game.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland got within 36-32 with 12 minutes remaining on
consecutive jumpers by Jones and a basket by Rushia Brown. The
Liberty missed 10 of 14 shots in that span before taking a 49-38
lead with five minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   Hammon had seven points and Robinson added six in the 13-6 run.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockers, who shot just 29 percent in the first half, trailed
28-19 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty tied a team record with their 12th home victory
after a 2-4 start. They went 12-3 at home in 1998 and 12-4 last
season. New York won seven straight home games spanning the 1997
and 1998 seasons.

<HEADLINE> More mosquitoes in city, Suffolk, Rockland test positive  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Thirteen more pools of mosquitoes were found
infected with the West Nile virus, including five on Staten Island,
the state Health Department said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mosquitoes from Rockland County and Suffolk County also tested
positive, the department said.
</P>
<P>
   There were no new human cases announced. Only one person, a man
from Staten Island who is recovering, has been reported infected so
far this year.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, seven people in the metropolitan area were killed as
the virus, which is transmitted from mosquitoes to humans, made its
first known appearance in the Western Hemisphere. Various testing
and mosquito-control measures have been taken since, including
regular collections of mosquitoes in traps to see where the
infection is present.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Department said four collections, or pools, were
found positive in Rockland, where two positive pools had been found
before; four infected pools were found in Suffolk, for a total of
35 there; and five were found in Staten Island, bringing the New
York City total to eight - seven in Staten Island and one in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, Westchester and Orange counties had positive
mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this season, the discovery of infected mosquitoes
prompted ground spraying of pesticides. But most of the mosquito
infections announced Tuesday were in areas that have been sprayed
since the mosquitoes were collected.
</P>
<P>
   Rockland County Health Commissioner Gabriel Guardarramas said
there was no need for further spraying in Rockland.

<HEADLINE> Korean Workers Shop With Credit  </HEADLINE>
By SANG-HUN CHOE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- For the first time, communist North
Korea is allowing South Korean workers there to flash the ultimate
capitalist symbol: the credit card.
</P>
<P>
   But the isolated North is far from embracing the free market
ways of the South. The workers can only use South Korean cards in a
fenced enclave in a rural village on the North's northeastern
coast, and no North Korean entity is involved in the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The South Koreans, whose movements are tightly restricted, are
among 800 workers building Western-designed nuclear reactors near
Shinpo under a 1994 deal between North Korea and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Their enclosure has a supermarket, a karaoke bar, a barber shop,
a billiard hall and other amenities operated by South Korea's
Daewoo conglomerate, which has hired North Korean attendants.
</P>
<P>
   The attendants and workers, who are required by North Korea to
pay in U.S. dollars, often run out of change. So Seoul's Korea
Exchange Bank began issuing credit cards two weeks ago, said Lee
Kil-sung, an official of Seoul's Financial Supervisory Service.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 42 South Koreans have taken out credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S.-led consortium, called the Korean Peninsula Energy
Development Organization, is building two reactors in return for a
freeze on the North's nuclear program. U.S. and South Korean
officials had believed North Korea was using its Soviet-designed
reactors for a nuclear weapons program.

<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. is expected to recall about 20
million of its tires tomorrow for light trucks and sport utility vehicles that

familiar with the decision said today. Most of the Firestone ATX, ATX II and
Wilderness tires are on Ford Explorers, the top-selling SUV, but the recall will
include tires on all brands of vehicles, the source said. The source also said
the recalled tires will be replaced by other Firestone tires.

   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Heavily armed paramilitary groups slaughtered at
least 13 villagers they claimed were rebel sympathizers in two separate attacks
in northern Colombia, authorities said Tuesday. Men wielding machine guns and
wearing military fatigues stormed into the hamlet of San Diego, located about
400 miles northeast of the capital of Bogota Monday night and began pulling
civilians from their homes. The attackers shot and killed three woman and four
men, said a spokesman for the local police force in the northern province of

Feds to Shut Down Va. Crab Fishing

   LEWES, Del. (AP) -- The federal government intends to shut down Virginia's
horseshoe crab fishing industry because the state has refused to comply with
caps on crab harvests. U.S. Commerce Secretary Norman Mineta said today that the
moratorium on horseshoe crab fishing in Virginia waters will be imposed next
month unless the state takes steps to drastically reduce the number of horseshoe
crabs fished out of its waters or brought to Virginia ports by trawlers that
fish federal waters. The federal ban would prohibit Virginia watermen and
seafood packing companies from catching, possessing or selling horseshoe crabs.

Pinochet's supporters in Congress announced a bill to try to block a trial of
the 84-year-old Pinochet on grounds of health. Pinochet made a surprise
appearance at dusk at the front door of his home to acknowledge cheer and
applause by scores of supporters. He had not been seen in public since attending

Study: More Students Smoking Cigars

   CHICAGO (AP) -- A new survey has found that tobacco use by college students
is not limited to cigarettes and that more young people are smoking cigars,
previously a habit associated mostly with older men. The survey, published in
Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association, surveyed 14,138
students nationwide and was part of the 1999 Harvard College Alcohol Survey. It
followed-up to similar surveys in 1993 and 1997. Overall, the 1999 survey found
that nearly 46 percent of students had tried cigarettes, cigars and other
tobacco products in the previous year. A third said they had used tobacco
products in the last 30 days.

<HEADLINE> Duke Golfer Beth Bauer To Turn Pro  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Duke golfer Beth Bauer has decided not to
return for her junior year and will turn pro instead.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, who hinted last month at the ShopRite LPGA Classic that
she might turn pro, will make her professional debut next month at
the State Farm Rail Classic, Golfweek magazine reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''In college golf I don't feel like I can develop my game
fully,'' she told Golfweek. ''I'm such an individual. I like to do
things on my own, and with the team, I couldn't always do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, 20, is among the nation's top-ranked women amateurs.
</P>
<P>
   She was a two-time, first-team All-America and won three college
titles, including the 1999 ACC championship and NCAA East regional.
She was also a member of Duke's 1999 NCAA national championship
team.
</P>
<P>
   ''She has a dream as strong as anybody I've ever known,'' Duke
coach Dan Brooks said. ''I don't think she had anybody telling her
what to do, so I admire her for following her dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer played this summer on her second victorious Curtis Cup
team and has played in four LPGA events this year.
</P>
<P>
   She tied for 35th in the Nabisco Championship and tied for 38th
in the Jamie Farr Kroger Classic but missed the cut in the LPGA
ShopRite Classic and the U.S. Women's Open.
</P>
<P>
   ''This summer, I didn't play as well as I hoped,'' said Bauer,
who is playing this week in the U.S. Women's Amateur at Waverly
Country Club in Portland, Ore. ''But I'm learning, and it's been a
good experience.''

<HEADLINE> Rangers 11, Indians 2  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Kenny Rogers cooled down Cleveland by pitching
eight strong innings Tuesday night and Gabe Kapler extended his
hitting streak to 22 games as the Texas Rangers snapped the
Indians' six-game winning streak with a 11-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers (11-9), dropping breaking balls on the corners at will,
limited the Indians to two runs and eight hits. He walked four and
struck out three in winning for the first time in four starts.
</P>
<P>
   It was the left-hander's 400th career appearance for the
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Kapler's two-run double in the first tied him with Toronto's
Carlos Delgado for the longest hitting streak in the AL season.
Frank Catalanotto went 4-for-4 with a sacrifice fly and scored four
times as Texas bounced back after being shut out on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Ledee, traded from Cleveland to Texas last month, added
two RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bad day for the Indians on several fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, they learned that Manny Ramirez re-injured his
left hamstring and could be headed back to the disabled list;
right-hander Jaret Wright is facing season-ending shoulder surgery;
and the Indians missed a chance to gain ground on the AL
Central-leading White Sox, who lost the first game of a
doubleheader.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Bere (2-1) had been impressive in winning his first two
starts since being acquired by the Indians in a July 28 trade with
Milwaukee. The Rangers, however, never let the right-hander get
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   The first three Rangers to face Bere all singled and scored in
the first to give Texas a 3-0 lead. Rusty Greer's infield single
off Bere's glove loaded the bases with none out, and one out later,
Kapler doubled in two runs and extended his hitting streak.
</P>
<P>
   Ledee made it 3-0 with an RBI groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland got a run back in the second on Sandy Alomar's RBI
single, but Bere was in trouble again in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Catalanotto doubled leading off and went to third on a
groundout. The Indians were going to intentionally walk Rafael
Palmeiro, but Bere's outside pitch sailed over catcher Sandy
Alomar's head, allowing Catalanotto to score.
</P>
<P>
   Kapler hit his second double and Ledee singled him home to put
the Rangers ahead 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   Texas added two more runs in the fourth on Luis Alicea's RBI
triple and Catalanotto's sac fly.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians blew a chance to get back in it in the fourth when
they put runners at second and third with none out. But Jim Thome
got doubled off second on Wil Cordero's lineout and Sandy Alomar
popped to third.
</P>
<P>
   Greer hit a two-run homer, his fifth, in the seventh to make it
9-1.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Tuesday's game was the 500th in Jacobs Field since the
ballpark opened in 1994. Cleveland is now (306-193 coming in) at
home. Of the 496 home games -- there have been three regular
doubleheaders -- 467 have been sellouts. ... Texas LHP Darren Oliver
will start for Triple-A Oklahoma on Saturday night as he begins a
rehab assignment. Oliver is on the disabled list with weakness in
his pitching shoulder. ... Cleveland's pitchers gave up just 16
runs during the six-game winning streak. ... Rogers has the
Rangers' lone complete game this season.

<HEADLINE> Annan Shocked at Attack on U.N.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Secretary-General Kofi Annan appealed to
Afghan authorities on Tuesday to track down the gunmen who ambushed
and killed seven relief workers last week.
</P>
<P>
   The seven Afghans, who worked for the U.N.-supported mine
clearing program, were among 12 people shot and killed Saturday in
western Herat province. The Taliban religious militia that controls
90 percent of Afghanistan and the opposition accused one another of
carrying out the attack.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement read by deputy spokesman Manoel de Almeida e
Silva, Annan said he was ''shocked at the depth of the violence of
this unwarranted attack on humanitarian personnel that included the
torching of the two vehicles being used by the victims.''
</P>
<P>
   He sent condolences to the victims' families and called on all
sides in the Afghan conflict to apprehend the gunmen and bring them
to justice.
</P>
<P>
   ''The secretary-general hopes that urgent steps will be taken to
ensure the safety of humanitarian personnel and civilians in
Afghanistan,'' the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. mine clearing program announced it would suspend the
activities of the 5,000-strong program Thursday and observe a day
of mourning to commemorate the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Devastated by years of continued civil war, Afghanistan is one
of the most heavily mined countries in the world. Several foreign
funded agencies are working to clear the land.

<HEADLINE> Manhattan judge issues restraining order against union vandalism  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A Manhattan judge issued a temporary restraining
order against strikers at Verizon Communications late Tuesday after
hearing that supervisory workers at the telecommunications company
had been obstructed, threatened and assaulted.
</P>
<P>
   State Supreme Court Justice Louis York said he found that the
strikers, members of the Communications Workers of America, pelted
people with eggs, surrounded cars and jumped up and down on them,
yelled profanities at workers, blocked entrances and exits and
committed other unlawful acts.
</P>
<P>
   The CWA's lawyer, James Reif, told York that he should not
penalize the union for a ''handful of incidents'' by ''a handful of
individuals.'' He said Verizon knows who the people are and should
have had them arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Masder, political director of the CWA, said the union had
passed out a booklet detailing the dos and don'ts of lawful
picketing.
</P>
<P>
   Al Luzzi, of Passaic, N.J., vice president of CWA Local 1101,
said that if he learned of anyone acting unlawfully on a picket
line, he would remove him from the picket line and give him another
job.
</P>
<P>
   But York said he believed ''the illegal acts were performed and
nurtured not only by union members but by people in authority at
the union.''
</P>
<P>
   York ordered pickets to stay at least 10 feet from Verizon's
facilities, work sites and buildings, and to permit enough space
for at least two people to walk side-by-side to and from those
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   York granted the restraining order at Verizon's request after a
nearly five-hour hearing Tuesday afternoon. Witnesses testified
that service had been knocked out in several areas because wires
and cables were cut at control stations.
</P>
<P>
   ''These kinds of acts cause harm to the public,'' the judge
said. ''We cannot deny that the public has been harmed.''
</P>
<P>
   Verizon's lawyer, Christopher Parlo, told York that Verizon had
recorded 381 acts of vandalism in New York State since the strike
started Sunday. Negotiations continued Tuesday and officials
reported making some inroads.
</P>
<P>
   The restraining order issued by York is similar to those Verizon
obtained earlier this week in courts in Pennsylvania and Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   The company has said it would offer a $25,000 reward for
information that leads to successful prosecution of assaults on
company employees or damage to company property.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 87,200 workers are covered by the contract that
expired Sunday. Robert Masder, CWA political director, said 32,000
of those workers are in 27 locals in New York State.
</P>
<P>
   In granting the restraining order, York implied that the court's
intervention might be needed because, ''I do think it has been
shown that the police cannot offer adequate protection.''
</P>
<P>
   York told lawyers for both sides to return to his courtroom
Monday.

<HEADLINE> Teen Birth Rate Lowest in 60 Years  </HEADLINE>
By ERIN McCLAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Teen-agers are having babies at the lowest rate
in at least 60 years, and everyone is taking credit -- from
religious groups that push abstinence to advocates for
contraceptives and sex education in schools.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts from several viewpoints agreed Tuesday on this much:
Teens are more terrified than ever of sexually transmitted
diseases, and they are putting off starting families to take jobs
in the booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   For every 1,000 girls ages 15 to 19, there were 49.6 births last
year -- the lowest level since the statistic was first recorded six
decades ago, the National Center for Health Statistics said.
</P>
<P>
   The rate dropped consistently throughout the 1990s, falling 20
percent for the decade.
</P>
<P>
   ''Teen-agers frankly are more conservative sexually,'' said Bill
Albert, spokesman for the National Campaign to Prevent Teen
Pregnancy. ''They realize that the risks in the 1990s were quite a
bit different than the risks their parents took in the '60s and
'70s.''
</P>
<P>
   The drop was particularly sharp among girls ages 15 to 17, whose
rate fell 6 percent from its level in 1998 to 28.7 births per
1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Births fell 2 percent among 18-to-19-year olds and 4 percent
among girls ages 10 to 14, said the statistics center, a division
of the federal government's Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   The teen birth rate fell across racial lines, most dramatically
among black teens, whose rate dropped 38 percent from 1991 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''These encouraging trends cut across those younger and older
teens, married and unmarried teens, all states and all racial and
ethnic groups,'' President Clinton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used the study as an opportunity to urge Congress to
approve $25 million for what are being called ''second-chance
homes,'' where teen parents can live and get job counseling and
learn parenting skills.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said HIV/AIDS became mainstream enough in the 1990s to
scare teen-agers, while awareness of other STDs was at an all-time
high.
</P>
<P>
   They said ad campaigns, community awareness groups and even
seeing friends have children encouraged teens to be more careful --
or stop having sex altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the past, abstinence was a joke,'' said Bronwyn Mayden,
executive director of Campaign for Our Children, which promotes
abstinence. ''It's not a joke -- it's OK. Kids are really concerned
about catching STDs.''
</P>
<P>
   Government demographers credited pro-abstinence organizations
along with a swath of other groups -- including churches, parents
and school sex-education programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Young people more and more are telling us they want to hear
from adults about sex,'' said Tamara Kreinin, president of the
Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States,
which promotes sexuality as a natural part of living. ''They want
to hear about values, about relationships, about love. It's very
important for young people to have sexuality education.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Brandt, an issue response director for the Focus on the
Family ministry, said more abstinence is the obvious reason why the
birth rate has fallen. He said the notion that contraceptives
should get credit comes from people who ''play little tricks with
the data.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the country's record-breaking economy may have something to
do with the falling teen birth rate. As more jobs with good pay
became available, some teens put off plans to have families.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's highest teen birth rate was in 1957, roughly 96
births per 1,000. Analysts pointed out that in the 1940s and 1950s,
when the statistics were first kept, people married younger.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics center also reported a drop Tuesday in births to
unmarried teens, a record number of women receiving prenatal care
and a rise in births by Caesarean section.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the CDC reported that the teen-age pregnancy rate
fell 8 percent from 1995 to 1997 and has declined every year since
1991.
</P>
<P>
   Even as they differed over why the teen birth rate has slowed,
analysts said they hope teens would not tune out messages of
responsibility. If the numbers continue to fall, they said, there
could be fewer children living in impoverished homes with
unprepared parents.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whenever we see good news on these social-issue fronts, people
have the tendency to say, 'We've solved this whole teen-birth
problem. Time to move on to bicycle helmets,''' Albert said.
''There's too many kids turning 13 next year for us to get
complacent.''

   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Jerome Smith, founding guitarist of
KC &AMP; The Sunshine Band, died Friday after being crushed in a
construction accident. He was 47.
</P>
<P>
   Smith fell off a bulldozer and was crushed by the machine.
Smith, who had left the band in 1979 because of drug problems, was
recently working toward rejoining the band by maintaining his
sobriety, said Mel Haber, manager for the group's leader, Harry
Wayne Casey.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a Miami-area native, founded the group in 1974 with
Casey, bass player Richard Finch, drummer Robert Johnson and conga
player Fermin Goytisolo.
</P>
<P>
   After a pair of forgettable songs, the group reached the top of
Billboard Magazine's charts in 1975 with ''Get Down Tonight.''
Before Smith left the group, it had five No. 1 songs, including
''Boogie Shoes'' and ''That's the Way (I Like It),'' and three
Grammys.

<HEADLINE> Vandalism reports surge as strike enters third day  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Telecommunications giant Verizon
Communications said Tuesday it has been subjected to hundreds of
acts of vandalism to its facilities and threats to managers trying
to cross picket lines since workers went on strike over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders, who are bargaining here to replace contracts that
expired Sunday for 87,200 workers, said it was unfair to suggest
their members are responsible.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it would offer a $25,000 reward for information
that leads to successful prosecution of assaults on company
employees or damage to company property. The strike affects 12
states - from Maine to Virginia - and the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ''Verizon will insist on being able to operate the telephone
network, and it will insist on being able to do that in safety,''
said Eric Rabe, spokesman for Verizon, which formed from this
summer's merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE.
</P>
<P>
   The talks adjourned late Tuesday night with no evidence of
progress.
</P>
<P>
   The company did not attribute unions as the cause of the
vandalism, but said indications of union responsibility were more
clear in situations where managers tried to enter facilities and
had rocks, bottles and eggs thrown at them.
</P>
<P>
   It said police were investigating some of the 455 incidences of
threats to workers, vandalism and assaults. About 230 of those took
place in New York, Rabe said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have any problem with peaceful picketing,'' he said.
But the company will ''not tolerate'' threats to the safety of
employees, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, a judge issued a temporary restraining order
against strikers late Tuesday after hearing that the company's
supervisory workers had been threatened and assaulted. The judge
ordered picketers to stay at least 10 feet from Verizon's worksites
and buildings. The restraining order only affects picketers in New
York state, although similar orders have been issued this week in
Pennsylvania and Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials called unfair any suggestion that unions might
be involved, and noted that the company experiences acts of
vandalism on any given day. They also chided the company for
seeking restraining orders in various parts of the region to limit
picketing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Verizon would be better advised to concentrate its attention
and resources on reaching a settlement and ending a strike, rather
than seeking to block CWA members engaged in peaceful picketing,''
said the union's president Morton Bahr.
</P>
<P>
   The strike affects the District and 12 states: Delaware, Maine,
Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York,
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   At the bargaining table, CWA and the International Brotherhood
of Electrical Workers continued to tussle over issues including the
shifting of work to other areas, a union concern stemming from the
merger that created Verizon. Particularly, union members fear that
the company will reroute service calls - and therefore jobs - from
the old Bell Atlantic territory into cheaper areas in GTE's region.
</P>
<P>
   ''As work becomes increasingly digitized, it can be moved
anywhere,'' said Jeffrey Keefe, associate professor of labor
studies at Rutgers University. ''It's certainly something that
would upset the membership if they see their jobs going away.
</P>
<P>
   Unions also are seeking greater ease in organizing Verizon's
wireless workers. On Tuesday, CWA alleged that the company has been
passing out anti-union materials to wireless workers in Woburn,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon's Rabe said he couldn't speak specifically to that
claim, but noted that the company has certain rights under federal
law to distribute documents
</P>
<P>
   '''Anti-union material' is in the eye of the beholder,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The parties did make some inroads, agreeing to return to the
core company some internal wiring work that had been farmed out to
a lower-paying subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides said there were no immediate plans to call in federal
mediators.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Verizon reported Tuesday that second-quarter
operating profits totaled $1.97 billion or 72 cents a share at Bell
Atlantic and GTE, which completed their merger in June. Those
results were about 5 percent better than year-ago levels, but
Verizon also reduced its profit forecast for the second half of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon also announced agreement Tuesday to merge its high-speed
Internet business with NorthPoint Communications Group, an upstart
provider of that service.

<HEADLINE> Braves 5, Reds 4  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Rafael Furcal had another three-hit game and
Andruw Jones and Wally Joyner each drove in a pair of runs Tuesday
night, leading the Atlanta Braves to a 5-4 victory over the
Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   The game was delayed briefly after the second inning when Braves
pitching coach Leo Mazzone fainted and fell onto the dugout floor,
leaving him with a bloody nose.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzone, 51, walked to the dugout tunnel, the left side of his
face bright red, and was taken to a hospital for an exam.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta also lost right fielder Brian Jordan, who strained groin
muscles while running out a grounder in the third and left for a
pinch-hitter two innings later.
</P>
<P>
   Furcal doubled and singled twice in his first three at-bats
against Elmer Dessens (5-2) for his third straight three-hit game.
The leadoff hitter is 9-for-14 over his last three games.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Ashby (8-8) drove in a run with a squeeze bunt as the
Braves went ahead 4-0 in the fourth, then withstood four one-run
rallies by the Reds. Ashby gave up nine hits, including Dmitri
Young's leadoff homer in the ninth, and Mike Remlinger got the
final three outs for his 11th save in 14 chances.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds lost for the sixth time in their last seven games and
added to their legacy of losing to the Braves. Atlanta is 25-6
against Cincinnati since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Andres Galarraga was out of the Braves' starting
lineup for a second day. Galarraga, who missed last season with a
cancerous tumor in his back, had tests Monday to make sure the
disease hasn't returned.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors recommended the tests as a precaution after X-rays found
that he had a cracked bone in his left thumb and a cyst near the
fracture. Results so far have found no trace of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Furcal led off the game with a slug bunt that landed him on
third. He eased his top hand down the bat and slapped a liner over
the head of third baseman Chris Stynes for a double, then continued
to third when Young bobbled the ball in left for an error. Jones'
grounder made it 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   Joyner had a sacrifice fly in the third and Atlanta stretched
the lead to 4-0 in the fourth on Ashby's squeeze bunt and Jones'
RBI single. Joyner added an RBI single in the seventh off Ron
Villone.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds couldn't score more than one run at a time. Young
doubled home a run in the fourth, Ken Griffey Jr. had an RBI double
in the fifth and Sean Casey singled home a run in the sixth. Casey
had two singles in four at-bats against Ashby, leaving him 8-for-16
career with two homers off the right-hander.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Braves 3B Chipper Jones went 0-for-5, leaving him in an
0-for-20 slump that is the longest of his career. He went 0-for-15
three times in 1995 and once in 1997. ... Reds SS Barry Larkin took
batting practice and fielded grounders for the first time since he
sprained a knee ligament last Friday night. He moved cautiously but
said he felt good. He could return during a weekend series in
Chicago. ... Young's ninth-inning homer broke Cincinnati's streak
of seven games without one, its longest streak since an eight-game
one in 1992. ... 3B Aaron Boone had reconstructive surgery Tuesday
for a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee. He's
expected to be fully recovered by spring training. ... A banner in
right field said, ''Griffey Who? Let's Go Andruw.''

<HEADLINE> Yankees 4, Athletics 3  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM NAZIMOWITZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Bernie Williams and David Justice homered on the
first two pitches from Jason Isringhausen in the bottom of the
ninth, giving the New York Yankees a 4-3 victory over the Oakland
Athletics on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Isringhausen (5-4) blew his seventh save -- and second straight --
in 32 chances, spoiling a strong outing by rookie left-hander Barry
Zito.
</P>
<P>
   Williams led off the ninth with a drive to right for his 25th
homer. Justice followed with his 30th homer, sending the Yankees
pouring out of the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   The home runs helped the Yankees snap a three-game losing streak
and avoided giving Roger Clemens his first loss in nearly two
months.
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Rivera (6-3), who loaded the bases in the ninth before
getting Adam Piatt to fly out to end the inning, got the win.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, undefeated in nine starts since losing June 9 to the
Mets, retired the first 11 batters before running into trouble in
an odd fifth inning that featured an inside-the-park homer that
appeared to go over the center-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Giambi walked with one out. Eric Chavez then hit a high
fly to center field. Williams, thinking the ball was out, was late
reacting. He got to the wall and leaped. Replays showed the ball
hit a barrier beyond the wall and ricocheted back onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   Second base umpire Charlie Reliford ruled the ball was in play,
and Chavez scored easily. Ramon Hernandez followed with a line
homer to left, his 13th of the year, making it 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Zito, a left-hander who kept the Yankees off-balance with
off-speed pitches, gave up two runs -- one earned -- and three hits
in 6 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens gave up three runs, five hits and four walks in seven
innings. It was only the second time in nine starts since his last
loss that Clemens gave up as many as three runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' first run came in the third when Scott Brosius led
off with a walk and went to third on a perfect hit-and-run to right
by Luis Sojo, making his first appearance since being reacquired by
New York on Monday. Brosius scored on Derek Jeter's double-play
grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Justice had an RBI single in the seventh, snapping the Yankees'
0-for-21 slump with men in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   Glenallen Hill greeted Jim Mecir with a double down the
left-field line, sending Justice to third. After an intentional
walk to Tino Martinez loaded the bases, Brosius struck out,
bringing up pinch-hitter Jose Canseco for his Yankees' debut.
</P>
<P>
   Canseco got a huge ovation when his name was announced, but
broke his bat and flied out to short right.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The inside-the-park homer was the first by an opposing team
at Yankee Stadium since Milwaukee's David Hulse on Aug. 1, 1995.
... The A's have 11 back-to-back and two inside-the-park homers
this year. Ryan Christenson also did it, May 21 at Oakland against
Minnesota. ... The Yankees and Oakland are two of only four AL
teams with better road than home records.

<HEADLINE> Navy Detains 11 Puerto Rican Youths  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- The U.S. Navy detained 11 more
protesters Tuesday, all young people who broke into its training
ground to try to stop military exercises on the outlying island of
Vieques, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters cut through a fence and were caught by military
police at about 5:30 a.m., spokesman Jeff Gordon said. He said the
detainees were members of a youth group but was unsure of their
ages.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from the United Vieques Youth said its members would
try again.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot continue letting the U.S. Navy trample our people
and rob us of the right to a healthy and dignified life,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters claim 60 years of bombing and other exercises on the
island has stunted its economy and damaged the environment and
islanders' health, charges the Navy denies.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy detained 32 women who broke onto the training range
Monday. They were charged with trespassing and freed until trial by
a federal magistrate.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters did not disrupt exercises by the USS Harry Truman
battle group, which began maneuvers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''These attempts to disrupt the exercises have utterly failed,''
Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy owns two-thirds of Vieques and has used it for training
since the 1940s. After an accident killed a civilian guard on the
bombing range, which is on the eastern tip of the island,
protesters occupied the area and thwarted further exercises until
federal agents forcibly removed them on May 4.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, hundreds of protesters have been arrested trying to
re-enter the range.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Doctors Happy To Be in Miami  </HEADLINE>
By ADRIAN SAINZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Two Cuban doctors said Tuesday that they were
subjected to grueling conditions when they were jailed for more
than a month in Zimbabwe after declaring their intention to defect.
</P>
<P>
   Far from the squalor of southern Africa, in a banquet hall
called ''The Refuge,'' Leonel Cordova Rodriguez and Noris Pena
Martinez told a gathering of jubilant Cuban-Americans and local
politicians that they were grateful to be in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''The jail was very rough,'' Cordova Rodriguez said. ''There
were 10, 12 people sharing one cell, and they tried to make our
lives as miserable as they could. We were afraid for our lives''
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Zimbabwe, they spent two weeks in Sweden on
temporary visas until departing Stockholm Monday for a 20-hour
journey to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're tired,'' said Cordova Rodriguez. ''But happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctors said their families may be subject to suffering at
the hands of the Cuban government for their defection, Pena
Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   Pena Martinez's father, on another Cuban medical mission, has
been sequestered, she said. Cordova Rodriguez said his wife and two
children were ''taken from their home and told to move.''
</P>
<P>
   The pair detailed how a doctor's life in Cuba differs from that
of American doctors. Cordova Rodriguez said his monthly pay was
equivalent to $26 to go with a $50-a-month stipend.
</P>
<P>
   Pena Martinez, a dentist, and Cordova Rodriguez, a physician,
are hoping to find work as assistants in their fields. Both plan to
go through the lengthy process of getting their Cuban degrees
revalidated in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first thing we're going to do is try to get our families
back from Cuba, where they're not safe,'' said Cordova Rodriguez.
''The next thing is we want to develop our professions.''
</P>
<P>
   Cordova Rodriguez, 31, and Pena Martinez, 25, were in Zimbabwe
on a medical mission when they sought refuge at the Canadian and
U.S. embassies in Harare, which referred them to the U.N. High
Commission for Refugees. But the Cubans disappeared June 2.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors accused Zimbabwean security officers of kidnapping
them and helping Cuban diplomats force them on a flight to Havana.
Air France refused to let them board during a stopover in South
Africa after the doctors slipped a note to a crew member saying
they were kidnap victims.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors were returned to Zimbabwe and jailed, while the U.N.
refugee agency demanded their release under international law. The
pair arrived in Stockholm on July 8 after the U.N. commission
negotiated their release.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba said the doctors betrayed the medical mission to aid
Zimbabwe's health service but denied any involvement in the alleged
kidnapping.

<HEADLINE> BWI Plans $1.3B Expansion Program  </HEADLINE>
By TOM STUCKEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- The state will embark on a $1.3 billion
expansion of Baltimore-Washington International Airport -- including
construction of a people mover and a huge new parking garage -- to
relieve congestion at one of the fastest growing airports in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   A new terminal will also be built and another expanded as part
of the five-year program.
</P>
<P>
   The number of passengers using BWI has increased from 10.3
million in 1990 to an estimated 19.4 million this year, and is
expected to increase to 30 million by 2010, Gov. Parris Glendening
said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor and transportation officials scheduled a news
conference at the airport Wednesday to announce the expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Glendening said Tuesday that the plan will result in ''the most
dynamic BWI expansion plan since Harry Truman opened the facility
in 1950.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's something that has to be done now,'' Glendening said.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.3 billion is in addition to $500 million already in the
budget for airport improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Glendening said the only serious complaints about BWI involve
lack of parking close to the terminal, congestion on the roadway in
front of the terminal and problems in getting from the garage to
the terminal.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the new money, $928 million, will be spent to solve
those problems, the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   The existing garage will be expanded to add 3,000 parking
spaces, and a rental car facility will be built to free 1,000
spaces in the garage now used by rental companies. A second garage
with 7,900 spaces will be built next to the expanded garage on what
is now the site of the Department of Transportation headquarters,
and a surface lot for 5,900 vehicles will be built near the two
garages.
</P>
<P>
   About $600 million will be spent to build an elevated people
mover, moving sidewalks, pedestrian bridges and to widen and extend
the terminal roadway.
</P>
<P>
   Dulles Airport, which outpaced even BWI's rapid growth rate last
year, recently announced a $3.4 billion expansion plan that
includes a fourth runway, a new concourse with 44 gates, thousands
of new parking spaces, and replacement of the unique mobile lounges
with a subway and moving sidewalks connecting the terminal to the
concourses.

<HEADLINE> Lieberman Makes Prayerful Debut  </HEADLINE>
By CALVIN WOODWARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Even in this season of prayerful politics,
Sen. Joseph Lieberman's introductory remarks to the nation as Al
Gore's running mate stood out in evoking a deeply personal -- but
very publicly displayed -- religious faith .
</P>
<P>
   To those who have a sensitive tripwire on the question of how
much religion in politics is too much, Lieberman's speech did not
necessarily offend. But it stirred concern.
</P>
<P>
   ''If today's speech were the speech he gave every day, I would
be troubled about what he's trying to communicate,'' said Barry
Lynn of Americans United for Separation of Church and State.
''Americans are a religious people but they get very nervous,
properly so, when candidates appear to have more to say about their
faith than they do about their solutions to the country's
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Normally in national politics it is the Republicans, influenced
for years by the religious right, who wear religion on their
sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   But Democratic Vice President Al Gore, a self-described ''child
of the kingdom,'' and Republican opponent George W. Bush, who
signed a proclamation in Texas making June 10 ''Jesus Day,'' are
both comfortable emphasizing their faith and their wish to involve
religious organizations more deeply in public policy while
respecting the line between church and state.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, the first Jew chosen as a major-party vice
presidential or presidential candidate, asked the crowd in
Nashville, Tenn., to ''allow me to let the spirit move me as it
does to remember the words from Chronicles, which are to give
thanks to God.
</P>
<P>
   ''To give thanks to God and declare his name and make his acts
known to the people. To be glad of spirit. To sing to God and to
make music to God, and most of all, to give glory and gratitude to
God from whom all blessings truly do flow.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dear Lord, maker of all miracles, I thank you for bringing me
to this extraordinary moment in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   By the standards of American political discourse, Lieberman
crossed a line, said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, who studies campaign
rhetoric as dean of the Annenberg School for Communication in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ''You would think you had just entered a religious service,''
she said. Political allusions to religion ''are not supposed to be
explicit or extended.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he is going to continue to open his speeches this way, it
is going to become problematic.''
</P>
<P>
   Political scientist Geoff Layman of Vanderbilt University, who
is researching religious differences between the two parties, said
he was struck that Lieberman would invoke religion ''in such a
powerful way'' given the attention being paid to his particular
faith.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course, he did it in a nondenominational way,'' Layman said
from Nashville. Still, ''it might raise eyebrows among people who
are not very religious.''
</P>
<P>
   And according to his research, the Democratic Party is
increasingly drawing support from people who are not religious
while Republicans build their flocks from among the devout. Layman
attributes religion's sometimes prominent role in the Gore campaign
to the vice president's wish to separate himself from the moral
controversies that surrounded President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But in a candid moment more than a year ago, Gore policy adviser
Elaine Kamarck told a newspaper, ''The Democratic Party is going to
take back God this time.''
</P>
<P>
   And the new Democratic platform suggests belief in God is a
universal attribute of the party, asserting ''Democrats believe
that God has given the people of our nation'' a mission for racial
and ethnic unity.
</P>
<P>
   Not that openly devout Democrats are new to presidential
politics. Jimmy Carter made no secret that he was a born-again
Christian, causing some nervousness among those who worry about
losing the line between church and state.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't change the teachings of Christ,'' he said. ''I believe
in them, and a lot of people in this country do as well.''
</P>
<P>
   That was from a 1976 Playboy interview far more famous for his
confession that ''I've committed adultery in my heart many times.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter taught Sunday school while president, yet emphasized he
would in no way mix his Baptist beliefs with his presidential
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn noted that John Kennedy, in a campaign that made him the
first Roman Catholic president, declared his belief in the
''absolute'' separation of church and state, and played down his
religion.
</P>
<P>
   ''My concern is when politicians cross the line between
expressing their convictions and move to pandering for votes,''
Lynn said. ''I don't think that Senator Lieberman's speech today,
standing alone, demonstrates that pandering. But I would hope that
every political address he gives in the future does not begin with
a prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be wallowing in one's religious convictions.''

<HEADLINE> Fox Promotes Free Trade Talks  </HEADLINE>
By KEVIN GRAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Mexico's President-elect Vicente
Fox said Tuesday that his country and the members of South
America's largest trade bloc want to hold talks on a free trade
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Fox was in Argentina on the latest stop of a four-nation tour to
press his message that he seeks closer trade ties with Latin
America, after his country formed the world's largest trade bloc,
NAFTA, with the United States and Canada in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina, along with Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay, forms
Mercosur, the world's third biggest free trade grouping. The
members have long talked of increasing ties with Mexico, Latin
America's second-largest economy.
</P>
<P>
   After talks with President Fernando De la Rua, Fox told
journalists that both leaders were of ''strong common agreement''
to begin talks on creating a free trade area between Mexico and
Mercosur.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is now a concrete invitation from the countries of
Mercosur to begin talks on negotiating a free trade agreement with
Mexico,'' said Fox, as De La Rua nodded his head beside him. ''Our
response is certainly positive. We want to make absolutely clear
that we are turning our eyes toward Latin America.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no indication of when such talks could begin, if an
agreement to hold them is finalized. More concrete steps toward
launching talks would have to wait until after Fox takes office
Dec. 1 for his six-year term.
</P>
<P>
   Fox was in Chile on Monday and continues on in his tour to
Brazil and Uruguay. Chile and Bolivia are associate members of
Mercosur.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said the time was ideal for Argentina, Chile, and Mexico to
seek to deepen their economic ties with each other, given that Fox,
De la Rua, and Chilean President Ricardo Lagos were all recently
elected.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in a position to work together for many years, and this
is something we'd like to take advantage of,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox won a stunning victory July 2 that ousted Mexico's ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party from the presidency after 71
years in power.
</P>
<P>
   He and De la Rua said they swapped ideas on how to better battle
ills afflicting their countries, including crime, unequal
distribution of wealth and obstacles to education and access to
technology.

<HEADLINE> Gore Makes Lieberman Choice Official  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Al Gore introduced and celebrated his
Jewish running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, on Tuesday, likening
their White House quest to Catholic groundbreaker John F. Kennedy's
and declaring, ''We will make history again.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, in turn, credited Gore with barrier-busting
''chutzpah'' and said they would work to ''renew the moral center
of this nation.''
</P>
<P>
   With repeated emphasis on faith and values, the new Democratic
duo made clear they aim to replace the eight-year Clinton-Gore
partnership with a fresh start.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, soggy with sweat on an outdoor stage at high noon,
recalled that the last time the Democrats had their national
convention in Los Angeles -- as they will again next week -- they
nominated Kennedy who went on to be elected the first Roman
Catholic president.
</P>
<P>
   With a Jew on a major party's national ticket for the first
time, Gore said, ''We will tear down an old wall of division
again.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd cheered ''Joe! Joe!'' From the stage, Tipper Gore
snapped pictures with her camera. The 91-degree heat and high
humidity wore down the crowd, though most remained enthusiastic.
More than 100 people were treated for heat exhaustion -- five were
hospitalized as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's talk of diversity, values and faith reflected the
Democrats' determination to undercut Republican George W. Bush's
inroads with minority voters and his attempt -- obvious at the GOP
convention last week -- to shackle Gore to President Clinton and
talk of scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, the two-term senator from Connecticut, was the first
senator of either party to speak out on the Senate floor against
Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky, branding it ''immoral.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, he acted as character witness for Gore. ''He has
never never wavered in his responsibilities as a father, as a
husband, and, yes, as a servant of God,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   The two men and their wives, hands linked, took the stage to a
charging musical beat.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must work, and we will work -- Al and Tipper, Hadassah and I
-- to help renew the moral center of this nation so that families
can be stronger, children safer and parents empowered to pass to
their children their faith and their moral values,'' Lieberman
said.
</P>
<P>
   His words echoed those of his September 1998 speech accusing
Clinton of making it harder for parents to instruct children on
values and acceptable behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Varner of Etowah, who brought her daughter and grandson to
the rally, said, ''I wasn't sold before. But honey, I am sold 100
percent now. It was worth the five-hour drive.'' She said of
Lieberman, ''We needed him a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Shedding his suit coat, the slightly built senator asked the
crowd's permission ''to let the spirit move me.'' He quoted from
the Book of Chronicles and thanked God and Gore for ''making this
miracle possible for me in breaking this barrier for the rest of
America forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching from behind a fence, Republican tourist Giovanni
Santarsiere, 58, from Houston, grudgingly credited Gore for
''breaking new ground'' with the Lieberman pick but added, ''I hope
it doesn't help him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore aides, though, reveled in some evidence that Lieberman
already had helped. A CNN-USA Today-Gallup survey Monday night,
after Lieberman's selection was publicized, showed Bush's lead cut
to 2 points from 19 over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   A CNN pollster said it was much too soon to know how closely
that change reflected longer-term reality. Gore campaign spokesman
Chris Lehane acknowledged, ''There's so much elasticity in these
polls, but the fact that it bounced this way can only be
interepreted as an affirmation and a positive response.''
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, Texas, Bush released a statement that referred to
Lieberman's record supporting missile defense, tuition vouchers for
private schools and privatization of Social Security reforms --
positions more in line with Bush than Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Tipping his hat to Lieberman's ''convictions'' and strong faith,
Bush continued:
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope he will run a positive campaign and that the vice
president will use this opportunity to change his tone to that of
Senator Lieberman's level.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was Lieberman, not Gore, who went after Bush on the
Nashville stage in a speech twice as long as Gore's and evidently
helped by Gore speechwriters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our opponents have done all they can to blur the differences.
Yesterday, they even responded to news that Al Gore picked me by
saying that George Bush and I think alike,'' Lieberman said, adding
a standard Gore zinger:
</P>
<P>
   ''With all due respect, I think that's like saying that the
veterinarian and the taxidermist are in the same business because
either way, you get your dog back.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 8,000 people packed the plaza and Capitol steps for the
rally, which opened with pop artist Jewel singing, ''Who will save
your soul from the lies that you told, boy?''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lieberman, who immigrated from Czechoslovakia as a girl,
marveled that they stood in a place honoring the World War II
soldiers who liberated her mother from the Auschwitz and Dachau
concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to fellow immigrants, Mrs. Lieberman said: ''This
country is our country. ... Anything is possible for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Said her husband, ''There are some people who might actually
call Al's selection of me an act of chutzpah.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, 58, didn't serve in Vietnam, receiving one deferrment
as a college student and another after his first child was born.
Gore spent five months in Vietnam as an Army journalist.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, the Rev. Jesse Jackson said of the newly minted
ticket, ''Let the nation rejoice. The tent is getting bigger and
better. Another barrier falls and another opportunity arises. A
political risk, a moral certainty.''

<HEADLINE> ABC Poll Looks at Lieberman  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Polling by ABC News immediately after the
selection of Sen. Joseph Lieberman as Al Gore's running mate found
that seven of 10 people think more favorably of the senator when
they hear he criticized President Clinton earlier than most
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   A Monday night poll taken by CNN-USA Today-Gallup suggested the
presidential race is a dead heat, 45 percent for Bush and 43
percent for Gore, after polling all weekend gave Bush a
double-digit lead.
</P>
<P>
   CNN pollster Keating Holland said the one-night poll of 667
registered voters might reflect a shift in the race or might be a
blip caused by a quick poll. The poll had an error margin of plus
or minus 4 percentage points. Polls taken over multiple nights with
more efforts to call back respondents give a more reliable sample
of public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous polls have suggested that Bush had a lead after the GOP
convention of anywhere from 11 points to 18 points. The race has
been expected to tighten in coming days with publicity about Gore,
his running-mate choice and the Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Holland said he'd seen signs in weekend polling of a closer race
between Saturday night and Sunday, but it would require more time
before it would be clear if Gore is closing Bush's lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is some concern that this was a one-night poll and
tremendous concerns that day by day in the mid-convention period,
every event has a big effect,'' Holland said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Kohut of the Pew Research Center for the People and the
Press said one-night polls taken after an event like the Lieberman
announcement are more a measure of emotion than of settled public
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Numbers like this are very ephemeral and reflect the emotion
of the moment, and therefore they last about a moment,'' Kohut
said. ''They give us a sense that public emotion was stirred.
Whether it will stay stirred in a Democratic direction remains to
be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   The ABC poll suggested public reaction to the Lieberman choice
was similar to response to the choice of Dick Cheney as the GOP
vice presidential nominee more than a week ago, with six in 10
saying they approve of each running mate. About the same number
said they don't know enough about either of them to have an
opinion. The ABC News poll of 513 adults had an error margin of 4.5
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   And eight in 10 said Lieberman's Jewish faith would not block
them from voting for him, according to the ABC poll taken Monday
night. More than half said his faith was a positive attribute,
compared to 17 percent negative. Pollsters find mixed evidence on
whether people will honestly answer a question about personal
biases.
</P>
<P>
   A new poll in the battleground state of Michigan suggested that
Bush is ahead of Gore, but no more than the lead the Republican had
before the GOP convention.
</P>
<P>
   The Epic-MRA poll had Bush at 45 percent, 37 percent for Gore, 5
percent for Ralph Nader and 1 percent for Pat Buchanan in Michigan.
Bush led Gore 46 percent to 34 percent with 8 percent for Nader a
month ago. The poll of 603 Michigan voters had an error margin of 4
percentage points.

<HEADLINE> More Homes Destroyed As Fires Rage  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID FOSTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   DARBY, Mont. (AP) -- Judy Greene drove out of the fire zone and
past pine trees burning like torches, past blackened sticks of
trees, past the rubble of neighbors' burned houses. The Goldstein
house, gone. The Davis house, gone. The Zikan house, gone.
</P>
<P>
   Greene's husband and son remained at their southwestern Montana
house, in harm's way. Authorities have said many people have defied
evacuation orders to try to save their property.
</P>
<P>
   ''This thing is so powerful you just feel helpless,'' Greene,
67, said Tuesday as she sat in the Montana Cafe picking at her
breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Her home remained in peril as the scenic Bitterroot Valley
blazed with wildfires, the three largest having scorched 124,500
acres as of Tuesday and defying all efforts to subdue them. Ravalli
County Sheriff Perry Johnson estimated 500 to 800 homes have been
evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   Greene said she knew there weren't enough firefighters to
protect her family's property.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure they're doing the best they can, but their resources
are stretched to the limit. You can't expect them to do the
impossible,'' Greene said.
</P>
<P>
   Across the West, the story was the same; overworked and
overwhelmed fire crews battling blazes that were igniting just as
older fires were brought under control. More than 20,000 civilian
and military firefighters had managed to contain 60 fires in the
past week.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-six major fires were active Tuesday and had blackened
866,000 acres in Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana,
Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming, according
to the National Interagency Fire Center.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, more than 4 million acres of forest, brush and grass
has burned this year, far more than by this same date in 1988, when
large parts of Yellowstone National Park went up in smoke.
</P>
<P>
   A 5,000-acre wildfire that closed Mesa Verde National Park in
southwestern Colorado for the second time this summer was 40
percent contained by evening, park spokesman Will Morris said. Full
containment was predicted for 6 p.m. Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's looking good, but nobody's letting down their guard,''
Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze had moved past cliff dwellings Monday and headed
toward a research center housing thousands of priceless Indian
artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bitterroot Valley, which stretches about 80 miles from
Missoula south to the Idaho state line, fires had destroyed at
least 73 buildings, including 51 homes and cabins.
</P>
<P>
   Miles away, south of Montana's capital city of Helena,
authorities Tuesday evacuated Jefferson City and nearby areas as
the 5,000-acre High Ore Road fire moved closer. Jefferson City,
some 16 miles south of Helena, has about 180 homes.
</P>
<P>
   The Bitterroot Valley has seen a population explosion over the
past decade as urban expatriates have swarmed in, eager for log
homes nestled in forests with snowcapped mountains on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Broadley of Hamilton was able to check his residence
Monday. He found it unscathed, but his neighbor's home was gone.
</P>
<P>
   ''All you can do is tell them the bad news,'' he said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Forces Move Into S.Lebanon  </HEADLINE>

   KFAR TIBNIT, Lebanon (AP) -- Lebanese security forces moved into
the former Israeli-occupied zone in southern Lebanon early
Wednesday, restoring a semblance of state authority for the first
time in 24 years to a region torn by conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Before dawn, a force of soldiers and police officers headed down
the coastal highway from the capital, Beirut, in central Lebanon to
the south and the border areas Israel vacated in May.
</P>
<P>
   The first units were led by a military police vehicle followed
by four armored vehicles carried on two trailer trucks. They
crossed the former front line outside this village between what was
the occupied zone and government-controlled territory at 6:10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The units moved through narrow mountain roads from Kfar Tibnit,
six miles north of the Israeli border, toward the main town of
Marjayoun in the east. Other units were headed toward Bint Jbeil,
another major town in the west.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Michel Murr had said the force comprises 500
soldiers from the military police and anti-terrorism units of the
Lebanese army as well as 500 policemen.
</P>
<P>
   The deployment, in a region that makes up 10 percent of Lebanese
territory, is token. But it will help fill a vacuum in state
authority in the zone that guerrillas have controlled since
Israel's May 24 withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   The force marks the first time the Lebanese government has
asserted control of the border areas of southern Lebanon since the
1970s. It had been a battleground for Palestinian guerrillas and
Israeli forces and their allied militias since 1976. Israel invaded
the south in 1978 and again in 1982. It carved out the border
security zone in 1985 before abandoning it in May.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. peacekeepers moved into the former occupied zone Saturday --
a step Lebanon had insisted on before its own deployment. But
tension in the area continues.
</P>
<P>
   Four people were wounded in the area Sunday and Monday when
Israeli soldiers fired at stone-throwers and youths preparing to
hurl a firebomb over the border fence near Fatima Gate, the main
flashpoint on the border. Israel has repeatedly called on Lebanon
to send its own forces into the south and warned it will no longer
tolerate stones being thrown across the border.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether Lebanon would deploy its security forces
near Fatima Gate. Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss said Tuesday
the deployment of U.N. peacekeepers and Lebanese forces at the gate
was ''an operational matter and is up to army officers to decide.''
</P>
<P>
   Murr has said Lebanese security forces will not deploy along the
border itself as that is the job of U.N. peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon has said it does not want to serve as Israel's border
guard in the absence of a peace treaty between the two countries
and between Israel and Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   But Murr also has said there would be no armed guerrillas in the
zone once security forces deploy. As of Tuesday evening, the
guerrillas still manned positions.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas have pledged to cooperate with the Lebanese
authorities after the Israeli withdrawal.
